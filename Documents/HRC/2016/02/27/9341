<p><b>I. INTRODUCTION 
</b> 
1. The Commission on Human Rights, in its resolution 2005/41 entitled 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Elimination of violence against women&#8221;, encouraged the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>Violence against Women, its causes and consequences (hereinafter &#8220;the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur&#8221;) to respond effectively to reliable information that comes before her and 
</p>
<p>requested all Governments to cooperate with and assist the Special Rapporteur in the 
</p>
<p>performance of her mandated tasks and duties, to supply all information requested, 
</p>
<p>including with regard to implementation of her recommendations, and to respond to 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visits and communications.   
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2. The present addendum to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s annual report contains, on a 
</p>
<p>country by country basis, summaries of individual allegations, as well as urgent 
</p>
<p>appeals sent to Governments on individual cases and general situations of concern to 
</p>
<p>her mandate. This report includes summaries of the communications sent from 
</p>
<p>1 January to 4 December 2007 (with respect to allegation letters), and to 4 January 
</p>
<p>2008 (with respect to urgent appeals). The report also contains summaries of 
</p>
<p>government replies received until 21 January 2008.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur recalls that in issuing urgent appeals and transmitting 
</p>
<p>allegations, she does not make any judgment concerning the merits of the respective 
</p>
<p>cases, nor does she necessarily support the opinions and activities of the persons on 
</p>
<p>behalf of whom she intervenes. In the original communications, the full names of 
</p>
<p>victims and perpetrators have been provided to the Government concerned. In this 
</p>
<p>report, the names of individual victims and alleged perpetrators have been replaced by 
</p>
<p>initials in order to protect their privacy and to prevent further victimization as well as 
</p>
<p>to avoid pre-judgement of the alleged perpetuators.  
</p>
<p><b>II. OVERVIEW OF COMMUNICATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Communications sent 
</b></p>
<p>4. From 1 January to 4 December 2007 and 4 January 2008, respectively, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur transmitted 59 communications to 38 Member States: Algeria, </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 5 
 
Angola, Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Colombia, 
</p>
<p>Ecuador, Fiji, Guatemala, Guinea, Honduras, India, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, 
</p>
<p>Kyrgyzstan, Malaysia, Mexico, Myanmar, Mongolia, Mozambique, Nepal, New 
</p>
<p>Zealand, the Philippines, Qatar, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Saudi Arabia, 
</p>
<p>South Africa, Sri Lanka, the Sudan, Sweden, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of America and 
</p>
<p>Uzbekistan. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>5. 28 communications are allegation letters pertaining to allegations of human 
</p>
<p>rights violations that had already occurred or reflected longstanding concerns. In 31 
</p>
<p>cases, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal because a human rights violation 
</p>
<p>was ongoing or imminent, and there was a need to inform the government authorities 
</p>
<p>about the allegations received without any delay. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>6. 52 out of 59 communications were sent jointly with other mandate holders of 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights Council, as follows: 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>- The Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
</p>
<p>rights defenders (24) 
</p>
<p>- The Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
</p>
<p>treatment or punishment (24) 
</p>
<p>- The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
</p>
<p>freedom of opinion and expression (9) 
</p>
<p>-  The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants (8) 
</p>
<p>- The Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
</p>
<p>pornography (7) 
</p>
<p>- The Special Rapporteur on the human rights aspects of the victims of 
</p>
<p>trafficking in persons, especially women and children (7) 
</p>
<p>-  The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (5) 
</p>
<p>- The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental 
</p>
<p>freedoms of indigenous people (5) 
</p>
<p>- Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an 
</p>
<p>adequate standard of living (4) </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 6 
</p>
<p>-  The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers (3) 
</p>
<p>- The Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance (3) 
</p>
<p>- The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions (2) 
</p>
<p>- The Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief (2) 
</p>
<p>- The independent expert on minority issues (1) 
</p>
<p>- The Special Rapporteur on the right to food (1). 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>7. The largest number of joint communications (24) was sent together either with 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture or the Special Representative of the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>stresses that this fact indicates a convergence in the understanding of the diverse 
</p>
<p>forms of human rights violations experienced by women with that of more 
</p>
<p>conventional forms of violations. This may also signal an erosion of the public / 
</p>
<p>private sphere dichotomy used for so long to exclude violence against women from 
</p>
<p>public concern and scrutiny. Additional trends in the communications received are 
</p>
<p>identified in chapter III below on &#8220;Trends and Observations&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>2. Cooperation and replies of Governments to the Special Rapporteur  
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>8. In each of the communications, the Special Rapporteur has asked Governments 
</p>
<p>to respond to a detailed set of questions in order to clarify the allegations submitted. 
</p>
<p>As of 21 January 2008, the Special Rapporteur had received responses to 34 cases 
</p>
<p>from Governments concerned and would like to express her particular appreciation 
</p>
<p>for timely replies. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned that only 
</p>
<p>19 communications sent in 2007 have so far been responded to. Sixteen Governments 
</p>
<p>failed to respond and some responded only partially to the issues raised. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur expresses her appreciation to have received, during the course of 2007, 
</p>
<p>15 additional responses to communications sent in 2004, 2005 and 2006. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>9. The following Member States did not respond to any of the communications

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>10. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur would like to recall Commission on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights resolution 2005/41 in which the Commission requested all 
</p>
<p>Governments to cooperate with and assist the Special Rapporteur in the performance 
</p>
<p>of her mandated tasks and duties, to supply all information requested, including with 
</p>
<p>respect to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s communications. 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>III. TRENDS AND OBSERVATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>11. The communications sent concerned a wide array of issues related to violence 
</p>
<p>against women, its causes and consequences, as defined in the 1993 United Nations 
</p>
<p>Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women. These included: arbitrary 
</p>
<p>detention, torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, summary 
</p>
<p>and extrajudicial executions; rape, sexual abuse and sexual exploitation; trafficking; 
</p>
<p>and other forms of violence grounded in discrimination against women. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>12. These various forms of violence against women were committed by both State 
</p>
<p>and non State actors. Overall, 35 out of 59 communications (59 per cent of the total 
</p>
<p>number) concern allegations of violence against women, or threats thereof, committed 
</p>
<p>by State agents. Police officers and military personnel in particular were identified as 
</p>
<p>the main perpetrators. The Special Rapporteur notes in this respect article 4 (b) of the 
</p>
<p>Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, which stipulates that 
</p>
<p>States should pursue by all appropriate means and without delay a policy of 
</p>
<p>eliminating violence against women and, to this end, should refrain from engaging in 
</p>
<p>violence against women.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>13. In addition, the Special Rapporteur also acted upon laws, regulations, drafts and 
</p>
<p>specific legal provisions which seemed to discriminate against women and may 
</p>
<p>condone or cause violence against women. Four letters were sent in this respect, and 
</p>
<p>while this is a small percentage of the total number of communications, it reflects the 
</p>
<p>importance the Special Rapporteur attaches to addressing the full spectrum of her 
</p>
<p>mandate, including the causes and consequences of violence against women. 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 8 
</p>
<p><b>1. Torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>14. 24 communications concern cases in which authorities tortured women and 
</p>
<p>sentenced or subjected them to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment 
</p>
<p>(including sentencing to death by stoning and corporal punishment). Such cases 
</p>
<p>amount to 71 per cent of all abuses perpetrated by State agents that were subject of 
</p>
<p>communications by the Special Rapporteur.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur notes that torture is prohibited under a wide range of 
</p>
<p>international instruments, such as article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
</p>
<p>Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Torture is also prohibited by many regional 
</p>
<p>instruments as well as under international criminal law and international humanitarian 
</p>
<p>law. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>16. More specifically, the Special Rapporteur would like to stress that in its 
</p>
<p>resolution 2005/39, the Commission on Human Rights reminded Governments that 
</p>
<p>corporal punishment can amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment or even 
</p>
<p>to torture. The Special Rapporteur on the question of torture&#8224;, the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Committee and the Committee against Torture have all called on States to abolish all 
</p>
<p>forms of judicial and administrative corporal punishment without delay. 
 
</p>
<p><b>2. Sexual violence 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>17. 25 out of 59 communications (42 per cent of the total number) concern 
</p>
<p>allegations of rape, sexual abuse and exploitation. 16 thereof (64 per cent) were 
</p>
<p>allegedly committed by State agents. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur notes that, in recent years, there has been an increased 
</p>
<p>and explicit recognition of some forms of violence against women in international and 
</p>
<p>national courts as amounting to torture and ill-treatment, the best known examples 
</p>
<p>being rape by private or public actors in conflict or in custodial settings. Other forms 
</p>
<p>of violence against women, such as physical or sexual violence in an intimate 
                                                 
&#8224; See A/60/316.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 9 
 
relationship, if committed with the acquiescence of the State, may qualify as torture or 
</p>
<p>cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment as well. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>on the question of torture joined the Special Rapporteur on violence against women in 
</p>
<p>seven communications pertaining to allegations of rape. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>19. Under international human rights law, notably the Declaration on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of Violence against Women and the Convention against Torture and 
</p>
<p>Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, States have thus the 
</p>
<p>obligations to criminalize acts of torture and violence against women, prosecute 
</p>
<p>perpetrators and provide reparation to victims. Accordingly, States must thus do their 
</p>
<p>utmost to prevent the perpetration of sexual violence, address any act of sexual 
</p>
<p>violence and offer judicial remedies to the victims.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>3. Violence against human rights defenders  
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur observes an ongoing trend to subject female human 
</p>
<p>rights defenders and women&#8217;s rights defenders to violence, including arbitrary 
</p>
<p>detention and threats of violence. 24 out of 59 communications (41 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>total number) concerned cases of this nature. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>21. The great majority of these cases (16 out of 24; 67 per cent of the violence 
</p>
<p>against human rights defenders cases) concerned women&#8217;s rights defenders and the 
</p>
<p>alleged perpetrators were mostly identified as State agents (21 out of 24; 87.5 per cent 
</p>
<p>of the violence against human rights defenders cases). 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>22. In this respect, the Special Rapporteur would like to remind Member States that 
</p>
<p>by ratifying the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
</p>
<p>Women they have committed themselves to take all appropriate measures to eliminate 
</p>
<p>discrimination against women in the political and public life of their respective 
</p>
<p>country and, in particular, to ensure to women, on equal terms with men, the right to 
</p>
<p>participate in non governmental organizations and associations concerned with the 
</p>
<p>public and political life of the country (article 7 of the Convention). Further, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur wishes to reiterate the principle reiterated in Commission on </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 10 
</p>
<p>Human Rights resolution 2005/38 in which the Commission calls on States to 
</p>
<p>facilitate the full, equal and effective participation and free communication of women 
</p>
<p>at all levels of decision making in their societies. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b> 4. Violence against women facing multiple and intersecting layers of 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>23. 19 out of 59 communications sent (32 per cent of the total number) concerned 
</p>
<p>women facing multiple and intersecting layers of discrimination. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>24. Women belonging to national, ethnic or religious minorities or lower social 
</p>
<p>castes, indigenous women, and migrant women are strongly overrepresented among 
</p>
<p>reported victims. The Special Rapporteur has also acted on a case of a 
</p>
<p>transgender/gay activist, who was targeted due to his sex identity choice and his 
</p>
<p>activity of bisexuals, gays and travesties&#8217; rights defender, as well as on a case of a 
</p>
<p>lesbian couple, who was reportedly persecuted because of their sexual orientation. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>25. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur would like to refer to Commission on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights resolution 2005/41 on the elimination of violence against women in 
</p>
<p>which the Commission calls on States to address the specific circumstances facing 
</p>
<p>indigenous women and girls in relation to gender-based violence, especially sexual 
</p>
<p>violence, arising from multiple, intersecting and aggravated forms of discrimination, 
</p>
<p>including racism, paying particular attention to the structural causes of violence.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur would also like to draw the attention of Member States 
</p>
<p>to article 22, paragraph 2, of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Indigenous Peoples&#8225; which stipulates that States shall take measures, in conjunction 
</p>
<p>with indigenous peoples, to ensure that indigenous women and children enjoy the full 
</p>
<p>protection and guarantees against all forms of violence and discrimination.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>5. Trafficking of women, and sale of children 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
&#8225; General Assembly resolution 61/295. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 11 
</p><p> 
27. The Special Rapporteur expresses her concern over the many cases of 
</p>
<p>trafficking in persons and sale of children on which she acted (11 out of 59; 19 per 
</p>
<p>cent of the total number), and with respect to which women and girls were most 
</p>
<p>affected. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>28. Several communications sent concern groups of women or children being 
</p>
<p>trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation. This fact reveals the existence of a 
</p>
<p>net of criminal organizations, taking advantage of poverty, lack of knowledge and 
</p>
<p>education, border guards&#8217; corruptibility and many other factors. In this regard the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur would like to stress the States&#8217; duty and responsibility to fight this 
</p>
<p>ever-increasing phenomenon, whether the States are countries of origin, transit or 
</p>
<p>destination of trafficking. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur encourages Member States to ratify the Protocol to 
</p>
<p>Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and 
</p>
<p>Children, Supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational 
</p>
<p>Organized Crime, and to make use of the &#8220;Recommended Principles and Guidelines 
</p>
<p>on Human Rights and Human Trafficking&#8221; developed by the Office of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.&#167; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>6. Failure to prevent and respond to violence against women with due 
</b></p>
<p><b>diligence 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>30. According to the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women 
</p>
<p>and other human rights instruments, States have a duty to take positive action and 
</p>
<p>exercise due diligence to prevent and protect women from violence, to prosecute and 
</p>
<p>appropriately sanction perpetrators of violence and to ensure that victims of violence 
</p>
<p>receive compensation. States have this duty regardless of whether the relevant acts 
</p>
<p>have been committed by private or State actors. The failure to comply with any aspect 
</p>
<p>of the due diligence obligation constitutes a human rights violation. 
</p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 12 
</p>
<p>31. 28 out of 59 communications sent (47 per cent of the total number) concerned 
</p>
<p>allegations that a State failed to meet its obligations of due diligence in combating 
</p>
<p>violence against women. The Special Rapporteur has for instance acted on cases in 
</p>
<p>which authorities have been reported to let investigations or prosecutions of acts of 
</p>
<p>violence against women lag, or where authorities failed to administer appropriate 
</p>
<p>punishments and penalties. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>32. Several communications sent indicate that general problems of impunity and 
</p>
<p>corruption in the public sector exacerbate gender-based violence by depriving women 
</p>
<p>of the option to invoke the rule of law to counter social power structures that 
</p>
<p>systematically discriminate against women.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur would like to recall her report on the Due Diligence 
</p>
<p>Standard as a Tool for the Elimination of Violence against Women**  and reiterate 
</p>
<p>that States cannot delegate their human rights obligations to prevent and respond to 
</p>
<p>violence against women with due diligence. They must therefore make appropriate, 
</p>
<p>decisive and timely interventions whenever public or private actors, State or 
</p>
<p>traditional justice mechanisms engage in and condone violence against women, or 
</p>
<p>otherwise fail to address it adequately.

<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>40. On<b> 13 December 2007, </b>the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
</p>
<p>causes and consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of 
</p>
<p>migrants and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture sent an urgent appeal 
</p>
<p>concerning the detention and deportation of a large number of Congolese nationals 
</p>
<p>from Angola to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.   
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>41. According to reports received, there have been serious human rights abuses 
</p>
<p>against the Congolese deportees, which have been allegedly committed by the 
</p>
<p>Angolan security forces at the border between the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
</p>
<p>and Angola.  These abuses have been purportedly targeted toward groups of migrant 
</p>
<p>workers mainly composed of Congolese citizens who are involved in informal 
</p>
<p>diamond mining activities in Angola. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>42. The abuses reported include the systematic use of physical and sexual violence, 
</p>
<p>confiscation of the migrant&#8217;s belongings and separation of family members during the 
</p>
<p>expulsion process. Allegedly, women were systematically raped by Angolan security 
</p>
<p>forces, on many occasions in front of their children or in public. Women were 
</p>
<p>continuously raped - while being expulsed from their homes, in provisional detention 
</p>
<p>facilities, at the checkpoints and during their transport to the border.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>43. In addition, the health situation of the expelled migrants is a major concern. As 
</p>
<p>most of them have been involved in informal diamond mining, they and their families, 
</p>
<p>including children, have allegedly been forced to submit to invasive bodily searches 
</p>
<p>(including the anal and vaginal cavities) to uncover hidden diamonds. According to 
</p>
<p>the reports, the searches are being conducted in such a manner that they are causing 
</p>
<p>psychological and physical trauma to the deportees. The mental and physical health of </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 15 
 
women victims of sexual violence is of particular concern: it has been reported that 
</p>
<p>they suffer from various pains in their vagina and lower stomach, and have been 
</p>
<p>deeply traumatized by the abuse they suffered. Most of them have not received any 
</p>
<p>health care upon their arrival to the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>44. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteurs received information that migrants had 
</p>
<p>been allegedly kept in incommunicado detention in harsh conditions before their 
</p>
<p>deportations, subjected to beatings and other forms of ill-treatment, having been 
</p>
<p>denied food and water provisions both during their detention periods and during their 
</p>
<p>deportation to the Congolese border. Moreover, there were reports of deaths due to 
</p>
<p>exhaustion or maltreatment.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Angola did not reply to 
</p>
<p>this communication and reiterates her interest in receiving responses from the 
</p>
<p>Government in regard to the allegations submitted and would be particularly 
</p>
<p>interested to know whether these cases have resulted in any prosecutions of alleged 
</p>
<p>perpetrators, and whether victims of rape have been granted reparation.

       Page 16 
</p>
<p>principalmente en pueblos rurales y barrios pobres de Asunci&#243;n. Estas redes 
</p>
<p>ofrecer&#237;an a las mujeres  y ni&#241;as trabajo como empleadas de limpieza en casas o en 
</p>
<p>comercios, o no especificar&#237;an el tipo de trabajo a realizar. Se informa adem&#225;s que 
</p>
<p>una de las razones por las cuales el enga&#241;o ser&#237;a efectivo es porque antiguamente 
</p>
<p>exist&#237;a una pr&#225;ctica que consist&#237;a en enviar a ni&#241;as a trabajar a casas de familia con el 
</p>
<p>compromiso de permitirles estudiar y mantener el contacto regular con sus familias de 
</p>
<p>origen. Se estima que en pueblos del interior subsistir&#237;a la creencia de que esta 
</p>
<p>pr&#225;ctica sigue ocurriendo. De esta manera, las v&#237;ctimas migrar&#237;an hacia Argentina con 
</p>
<p>la esperanza del empleo prometido, antes de resultar ser forzadas a trabajar en la 
</p>
<p>prostituci&#243;n. Tambi&#233;n se han recibido informes sobre casos de mujeres y ni&#241;as que 
</p>
<p>habr&#237;an sido objeto de trata interna de personas con el fin de su explotaci&#243;n sexual en 
</p>
<p>Paraguay, antes de ser llevadas a Argentina. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>48. La mayor&#237;a de las mujeres y ni&#241;as v&#237;ctimas de la trata entrar&#237;an a Argentina por 
</p>
<p>uno de los pasos fronterizos legalmente habilitados. Muchas se desplazar&#237;an hacia la 
</p>
<p>ciudad fronteriza de Encarnaci&#243;n antes de efectuar el cruce. Esta ciudad est&#225; unida a 
</p>
<p>Posadas, la capital de la provincia de Misiones, por el puente internacional San Roque 
</p>
<p>Gonz&#225;lez de Santa Cruz. En Encarnaci&#243;n, se recurrir&#237;a a &#8220;motoqueiros&#8221;, &#8220;mototaxis&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>&#8220;combis&#8221;, veh&#237;culos particulares o autobuses de l&#237;nea internacional o de larga 
</p>
<p>distancia para atravesar el puente. Tambi&#233;n se usar&#237;an peque&#241;as embarcaciones para 
</p>
<p>cruzar el r&#237;o Paran&#225;. Los reclutadores generalmente no cruzar&#237;an la frontera junto con 
</p>
<p>las mujeres, sino que las esperar&#237;an al otro lado del puente, o en la terminal de 
</p>
<p>&#243;mnibus de Posadas. Otros puntos importantes de entrada de v&#237;ctimas de trata de 
</p>
<p>personas a Argentina ser&#237;an  Puerto Rico, el cruce de Bernardo de Irigoyen, y la zona 
</p>
<p>de Candelarias. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>49. En la mayor&#237;a de los casos, el cruce de la frontera se efectuar&#237;a de manera 
</p>
<p>regular Las mujeres adultas cruzar&#237;an la frontera con la documentaci&#243;n de su pa&#237;s de 
</p>
<p>origen y acceder&#237;an a una visa turista por un per&#237;odo de tres meses.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>50. Las menores viajar&#237;an acompa&#241;adas o con un permiso regularmente obtenido. 
</p>
<p>Sin embargo, tambi&#233;n se se&#241;ala que algunos tratantes contar&#237;an con la complicidad de 
</p>
<p>las autoridades de polic&#237;a de ambos lados de la frontera o aprovechar&#237;an momentos de 
</p>
<p>escasa vigilancia. En este sentido, habr&#237;a evidencia del pago de coimas a  funcionarios </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 17 
 
en la frontera por parte de los tratantes, y de la escasa vigilancia acerca del permiso de 
</p>
<p>menores para poder viajar a Argentina.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>51. Por otro lado, tambi&#233;n se han reportado casos de uso de documentos falsificados 
</p>
<p>o robados para ingresar al territorio argentino. Otra modalidad de ingreso de v&#237;ctimas 
</p>
<p>de trata ser&#237;a la entrada por la categor&#237;a migratoria de Tr&#225;nsito Vecinal Fronterizo 
</p>
<p>(TVF), que permite el ingreso al territorio por 72 horas cuando las personas 
</p>
<p>permanecen dentro de un radio de 50 kil&#243;metros de la frontera. En este marco, las 
</p>
<p>formalidades de entrada son simplificadas. Sin embargo, una vez que las mujeres 
</p>
<p>habr&#237;an ingresado al territorio argentino por este medio, los reclutadores les 
</p>
<p>suministrar&#237;an tarjetas migratorias con visa turista marcadas con sellos falsificados. 
</p>
<p>En el puesto de control migratorio de San Jos&#233;, que se encuentra en el punto l&#237;mite del 
</p>
<p>radio de 50 metros para las visas TVF, funcionarios de la Direcci&#243;n Nacional de 
</p>
<p>Migraciones (DNM) habr&#237;an identificado varios casos de trata internacional de 
</p>
<p>v&#237;ctimas que hab&#237;an ingresado con la visa TVF, y luego habr&#237;an presentado una tarjeta 
</p>
<p>con un sello falsificado. Por &#250;ltimo, existir&#237;an casos d&#243;nde se usar&#237;a documentos 
</p>
<p>pertenecientes a otras personas para facilitar la entrada de mujeres mayores y menores 
</p>
<p>de edad. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>52. Las v&#237;ctimas de trata interna provendr&#237;an principalmente de las provincias de 
</p>
<p>Misiones, Corrientes, Chaco, Santa Fe y Tucum&#225;n. Tambi&#233;n se ha recibido 
</p>
<p>informaciones sobre La Rioja y Buenos Aires como lugares de proveniencia de las 
</p>
<p>v&#237;ctimas. En los casos de trata interna, las v&#237;ctimas tambi&#233;n ser&#237;an reclutadas 
</p>
<p>principalmente mediante una promesa enga&#241;osa de empleo. El reclutador ofrecer&#237;a 
</p>
<p>directamente un trabajo de empleada de hogar o en un comercio, o recurrir&#237;a al uso de 
</p>
<p>anuncios poco expl&#237;citos sobre las tareas a realizar.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>53. Tambi&#233;n se han recibido informes sobre casos de v&#237;ctimas que fueron 
</p>
<p>secuestradas con el fin de su posterior explotaci&#243;n sexual. Se estima que, durante los 
</p>
<p>&#250;ltimos cinco a&#241;os, hay m&#225;s de 70 casos de mujeres y ni&#241;as desparecidas, habr&#237;an 
</p>
<p>sido captadas por redes de tratantes en la provincia de Tucum&#225;n. 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 18 
</p>
<p>54. Las mujeres y ni&#241;as v&#237;ctimas de trata provendr&#237;an generalmente de situaciones 
</p>
<p>de pobreza extrema, habr&#237;an tenido dif&#237;cil acceso a la educaci&#243;n y carecer&#237;an de 
</p>
<p>oportunidades de empleo. En ambos casos de trata interna e internacional, los 
</p>
<p>principales lugares de destino ser&#237;an las provincias de Buenos Aires, C&#243;rdoba, Entre 
</p>
<p>R&#237;os, La Pampa, Chubut, Santa Cruz y Tierra del Fuego.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>55. Al llegar al lugar de destino, los tratantes recurrir&#237;an a distintos m&#233;todos de 
</p>
<p>coacci&#243;n que variar&#237;an entre amenazas psicol&#243;gicas y formas extremas de violencia 
</p>
<p>f&#237;sica. Testimonios recibidos, indicar&#237;an que las mujeres habr&#237;an sido amenazadas, 
</p>
<p>violadas y golpeadas por los tratantes. En muchos casos tambi&#233;n se les confiscar&#237;an 
</p>
<p>sus documentos de identidad inform&#225;ndoles de que &#8220;contrajeron&#8221; una deuda con el 
</p>
<p>tratante por los gastos del viaje, entre otros motivos adelantados. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>56. Se informa que la explotaci&#243;n sexual de las v&#237;ctimas de trata ocurrir&#237;a en lugares 
</p>
<p>denominados <i>whisker&#237;as </i>y <i>cabarets</i> que constituir&#237;an la figura m&#225;s com&#250;n bajo la cual 
</p>
<p>se esconder&#237;an los prost&#237;bulos. Para los mismos fines, tambi&#233;n se recurrir&#237;a a 
</p>
<p>departamentos llamados &#8220;privados&#8221;, especialmente en las grandes ciudades. Su 
</p>
<p>funcionamiento ser&#237;a similar al de los <i>cabarets</i> o <i>whisker&#237;as</i>, y se explotar&#237;a como 
</p>
<p>promedio a 7 mujeres por &#8220;privado&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>57. El sistema de las &#8220;plazas&#8221; permitir&#237;a que el proxeneta que no cuenta con un 
</p>
<p>establecimiento propio pueda enviar a las v&#237;ctimas a distintos prost&#237;bulos, cada vez 
</p>
<p>por un lapso de tiempo que var&#237;a entre una semana y 45 d&#237;as, denominado &#8220;plaza&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>por el cual cobrar&#237;a una suma fija de dinero, sobre la base de lo que las mujeres 
</p>
<p>explotadas puedan llegar a recaudar. El sistema impedir&#237;a que las mujeres lleguen a 
</p>
<p>establecer relaciones duraderas con un cliente al que podr&#237;an llegar a pedir ayuda o 
</p>
<p>denunciar su situaci&#243;n, al mismo tiempo que responder&#237;a a la demanda de &#8220;chicas

</p>
<p>jointly with the<b> </b>Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental 
</p>
<p>freedoms of indigenous people and the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of 
</p>
<p>racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, sent an allegation 
</p>
<p>letter to the Government regarding the recent adoption of the Northern Territory 
</p>
<p>National Emergency legislation in response to the situation of child abuse in 
</p>
<p>Aboriginal communities. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>60. According to information received, on 14 June 2007 the Northern Territory 
</p>
<p>Board of Inquiry into the Protection of Aboriginal Children from Sexual Abuse 
</p>
<p>released its final report <i>Little Children are Sacred</i> (Ampe Akelyernemane Meke 
</p>
<p>Mekarle). The outcome of a research of eight months, the report provided a blunt 
</p>
<p>description of the situation of &#8220;common, widespread and grossly under-reported&#8221; 
</p>
<p>sexual abuse of children, in particular of girls, in Northern Territory Aboriginal 
</p>
<p>communities, which is depicted as a &#8220;reflection of historical, present and continuing 
</p>
<p>social dysfunction.&#8221; The report contains a broad set of recommendations ranging from 
</p>
<p>prevention (including education, health services, housing, and employment measures) 
</p>
<p>to law and order, protection of children, and rehabilitation.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>61. On 17 August 2007, following the proposals tabled by the Minister for Families, 
</p>
<p>Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the Senate passed a package of 
</p>
<p>legislation integrated by the Northern Territory National Emergency Response Bill 
</p>
<p>2007; the Social Security and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment 
</p>
<p>(Northern Territory National Emergency Response and Other Measures) Bill 2007; 
</p>
<p>and the Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation 
</p>
<p>Amendment 2007 (hereinafter &#8220;NTNER legislation&#8221;). </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 20 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>62. The recently adopted NTNER legislation includes a number of extraordinary 
</p>
<p>measures applicable only to Aboriginal communities of Northern Territory, including 
</p>
<p>a system of alcohol restrictions, as well as offences for breaching these restrictions; 
</p>
<p>the acquisition of townships through five year leases; the licensing of community 
</p>
<p>stores; the audits of publicly funded computer, with offences for illicit use; a ban on 
</p>
<p>pornographic materials, an income management system; and changes to the 
</p>
<p>communities&#8217; permit system. These measures were coupled with a substantial increase 
</p>
<p>in the funding required to put them in place in the first twelve months after their entry 
</p>
<p>into force.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>63. On 22 November 2007, the government replied to the letter sent on 10 October 
</p>
<p>2007. It stated that the measures which comprise the NTER are necessary to ensure 
</p>
<p>that indigenous inhabitants of the Northern Territory, and in particular indigenous 
</p>
<p>women and children in relevant communities, are able to enjoy their social and 
</p>
<p>political rights on an equal footing with other Australians. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>64. The Australian Government declared to have taken immediate action following 
</p>
<p>the <i>Little Children are Sacred</i> Report which confirmed the strong link between 
</p>
<p>alcohol abuse, violence and the sexual abuse of children. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>65. The Government said that the NTER implements Australia&#8217;s obligations under 
</p>
<p>the Convention on the Rights of the Child and claimed that the NTER was not in 
</p>
<p>contrast with the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination since the different treatment, indigenous people would be submitted 
</p>
<p>to, was based on objective and reasonable criteria that implement a legitimate purpose 
</p>
<p>under relevant treaties, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>66. It was maintained that the &#8220;special measures&#8221; for the purpose of the Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination Act 1975, which implements Australia&#8217;s obligation under the 
</p>
<p>International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, do not seek to 
</p>
<p>take away rights and freedom. Rather, they provide the foundation for rebuilding </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 21 
 
social and economical structures and give meaningful content to Indigenous rights 
</p>
<p>and freedom. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>67. Furthermore, it was stressed that State and Territory child welfare and 
</p>
<p>authorities will be able to request the Government to income manage parents&#8217; welfare 
</p>
<p>payments in circumstances where they consider it is necessary to ensure that parents 
</p>
<p>meet their obligations to provide for their children&#8217;s basic needs. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>68. Regarding the consultation, the Government asserted that all prescribed 
</p>
<p>communities have been visited by teams from the Operation Centre and that a series 
</p>
<p>of regional community engagement workshops is underway. These workshops are 
</p>
<p>informing community members about the emergency response, providing an 
</p>
<p>opportunity for discussion, building relationships and seeking their involvement in the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the response. Also, the Centrelink (the Government&#8217;s welfare 
</p>
<p>payment delivery agency) is meeting individually with those affected by the welfare 
</p>
<p>reform measures. Further, Government Business Managers have been appointed for 
</p>
<p>each community to provide an on-the-ground Government presence.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>69. Moreover, the restrictions and general ban regarding alcohol and pornography 
</p>
<p>were claimed to be on <i>all</i> people in prescribed areas with the unique purposes of 
</p>
<p>helping these communities to deal with alcohol problems in a better way and avoiding 
</p>
<p>young children to be exposed to sexually explicit material with adverse effect on the 
</p>
<p>wellbeing and safety of these children. Also, the Government has introduced welfare 
</p>
<p>reforms in the NTER to stem the flow of cash being used to buy substances such as 
</p>
<p>alcohol, drugs and pornography, and to ensure that money meant for children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>welfare is used for that purpose. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>70. Additionally, it was stated that the Government will compulsorily acquire leases 
</p>
<p>over towns and communities specified by legislation for a period of five years. The 
</p>
<p>area of the land is less than 0.1 per cent of all indigenous land. The Government 
</p>
<p>considers this as crucial to removing barriers to implementing the NTER. It will allow 
</p>
<p>the Government to stabilize communities and ensure that children live in a cleaner 
</p>
<p>environment with more sustainable housing. Further, underlying rights, title and </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 22 
</p>
<p>interest of the indigenous owners will be preserved and compensation will be 
</p>
<p>provided whether payable. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>71. Regarding the existing permit system, the Government affirmed it has created 
</p>
<p>close communities which has hidden from public view and allowed some people to 
</p>
<p>create a climate of fear and intimidation. Therefore, public access will be allowed for 
</p>
<p>common areas in major communities, but homes will remain private and sacred sites 
</p>
<p>will be respected. In fact, the permit system will be retained for 99.8 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>indigenous land. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>72. Finally, the Government assured that, even if a court or bail authority will still 
</p>
<p>be able to consider customary law in limited circumstances, legislation makes it clear 
</p>
<p>that the decision to grant bail or impose a particular sentence should not be based on 
</p>
<p>whether the criminal behaviour would be assessed as less, or more serious, due to 
</p>
<p>customary law or cultural practice. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Australia for its 
</p>
<p>reply to her communication. She would like to appeal to the Australian Government 
</p>
<p>that, in its implementation of the Northern Territory National Emergency legislation, 
</p>
<p>it take all necessary measures to guarantee to indigenous women and girls the right to 
</p>
<p>be free from any form of violence, discrimination and abuse, and monitor and address 
</p>
<p>any negative impact on women of the implementation of this particular legislation. In 
</p>
<p>this respect, the Special Rapporteur recalls article 4 (c &amp; d) of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, which notes the 
</p>
<p>responsibility of States to exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate and, in 
</p>
<p>accordance with national legislation, punish acts of violence against women, whether 
</p>
<p>those acts are perpetrated by the State or by private persons. To this end, States should 
</p>
<p>develop penal, civil, labour and administrative sanctions in domestic legislation to 
</p>
<p>punish and redress the wrongs caused to women who are subjected to violence. 
</p>
<p>Women who are subjected to violence should be provided with access to the 
</p>
<p>mechanisms of justice and, as provided for by national legislation, to just and </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1

effective remedies for the harm that they have suffered. States should, moreover, also 
</p>
<p>inform women of their rights in seeking redress through such mechanisms.

<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>74. On<b> 25 October 2007, </b>the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, 
</p>
<p>jointly with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection 
</p>
<p>of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, sent an allegation letter concerning 
</p>
<p>Ms G. J., a women's rights activist and involved in the <i>Bahrain Women's Petition. 
</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>75. According to information received, in early October, a formal governmental 
</p>
<p>decision has been revealed concerning a prohibition for Ms. G. J. to appear in the 
</p>
<p>Bahraini press, including radio, television and all local newspapers. Allegedly, this 
</p>
<p>prohibition may be related to a letter that she sent to His Highness the King of 
</p>
<p>Bahrain calling for the dissolution of the Supreme Council for Women, which is 
</p>
<p>chaired by Her Highness Sheikha Sabika Bint Ibrahim Al Khalifa. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>76. Ms. G. J. had already faced charges in the past related to her professional 
</p>
<p>activities. In 2005, she was criminally prosecuted for allegedly criticizing family 
</p>
<p>judges. These proceedings were later discontinued. This case was the subject of a joint 
</p>
<p>urgent appeal sent on 13 June 2005 by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>on violence against women, its causes and consequences and the Special 
</p>
<p>Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>Since 2006, Ms. G. J. has allegedly been placed under surveillance, having her 
</p>
<p>activities and movements monitored by security officials.

<p>77. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Bahrain did not reply to 
</p>
<p>her communication sent in 2007 and reiterates her interest in receiving a response 
</p>
<p>from the Government in regard to the allegations submitted and would be particularly 
</p>
<p>interested to know whether these cases have resulted in any prosecutions of alleged 
</p>
<p>perpetrators.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>78. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur deems it appropriate to make reference to 
</p>
<p>article 7(c) of the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination 
</p>
<p>against Women which explicitly provides for the promotion and protection of women 
</p>
<p>in freely participating in public matters. States agreed to take all appropriate measures 
</p>
<p>to eliminate discrimination against women in the political and public life of the 
</p>
<p>country and, in particular, to ensure to women, on equal terms with men, the right to 
</p>
<p>participate in non-governmental organizations and associations concerned with the 
</p>
<p>public and political life of the country. Further, the Special Rapporteur wishes to 
</p>
<p>reiterate the principle reiterated in Resolution 2005/38 of the Commission on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights which calls on States to facilitate the full, equal and effective participation and 
</p>
<p>free communication of women at all levels of decision making in their societies.

<p>79. On <b>17 November 2006</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
</p>
<p>causes and consequences and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture sent an 
</p>
<p>allegation letter to the Government of Bangladesh concerning M. K., a 14-year old 
</p>
<p>girl, and her brother R. I., both residing in Uttar Chandani Mahal, Dighalia police 
</p>
<p>station section, Khulna district. M. K. was on the receiving end of an attempt of rape 
</p>
<p>and his brother was beaten. The full details of the allegations submitted have been 
</p>
<p>reflected in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s previous report on communications sent and 
</p>
<p>received.&#8224;&#8224;  
</p>

80. On <b>4 April 2007</b>, the Government replied to the letter and stated that the 
</p>
<p>allegations as referred to in the communication have been duly investigated by the 
</p>
<p>concerned authorities in Bangladesh. Findings of the investigation were attached, 
</p>
<p>responding specifically to questions asked by the Special Rapporteurs: 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>- The alleged facts stated in the summary of the case are not accurate. 
</p>
<p>- On 30 July 2006, a complain against assistant sub inspector (ASI) M. A. 
</p>
<p>of Khulna district police was lodged by victim M. K. to the learned 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Woman and Children Repression Prevention Tribunal&#8221;, Khulna. 
</p>
<p>Subsequently, the Magistrate 1st class Mr. Z. R., Zone-A, Khulna was 
</p>
<p>directed by the learned Judge of the Tribunal to conduct a judicial enquiry 
</p>
<p>into the matter. The learned Magistrate submitted a report on 25 February 
</p>
<p>2007 stating that no prima-facie case was made out in the enquiry. 
</p>
<p>- An enquiry was held by Ms. R. B., assistant superintendent of the police 
</p>
<p>(HQ), Khulna also. She found that on 21 July 2006 at about 3 pm, acting 
</p>
<p>on a tip-off ASI M. A. along with a two constables rushed to the house of 
</p>
<p>a wanted terrorist named R. I. (26), the victim&#8217;s brother, son of late H. at 
</p>
<p>H. D. (dacoit) of village North Chandnimahal, police station-Digholia, 
</p>
<p>District-Khulna. Sensing the presence of police, R. I. tried to run away 
</p>
<p>from his house. Constable-1535 M. M. A. was sent to the nearest police 
</p>
<p>camp for effecting reinforcement. Again, R. I. made an attempt to flee. 
</p>
<p>But, ASI M. A. swooped on and arrested him. Then some of his relatives 
</p>
<p>including M. K. arrived there and tried to free R. I. from police custody. 
</p>
<p>At one stage, ASI M. A. was also assaulted by the relatives o R. I. 
</p>
<p>However, he managed to round up R. I. Having been reinforced, police 
</p>
<p>brought the situation under control. Then, R. I. and his accomplices were 
</p>
<p>taken to Digholia police station and a case was registered against them 
</p>
<p>(Case No-07 dated 42 July 06 under section 186/224/225/320/353/511 of 
</p>
<p>Penal Code). After due investigation, a charge-sheet was submitted against 
</p>
<p>04 (sic) persons including R. I. At the time of writing the case was under 
</p>
<p>trial. In course of enquiry, it was revealed that R. I. was arrested in broad 
</p>
<p>daylight just on the bank of the pond. So the complain of attempt to rape </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 26 
</p>
<p>his sister Ms. M. K. and demanding bribe are totally baseless and 
</p>
<p>fabricated. 
</p>
<p>- No compensation has been provided to the victim or the family of the 
</p>
<p>victim by any organization so far.  
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Allegation letter  
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>81. On <b>16 January 2007</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
</p>
<p>causes and consequences jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
</p>
<p>judges and lawyers sent an allegation letter to the Government concerning Mrs. A. R. 
</p>
<p>M. (born 11 November 1989), wife of Mr. J. M., from Khaliar Chak village, under the 
</p>
<p>Paikgachha police station in Khulna district. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>82. According to information received, on 23 July 2006, Mr. P. M., member of a 
</p>
<p>rich and influential family and reportedly not related to the victim, allegedly raped 
</p>
<p>Mrs. A.R. M. when she was alone at home. Upon hearing her crying for help, her 
</p>
<p>neighbours and her husband, who arrived home by then, apprehended Mr. P. M. Soon 
</p>
<p>after, Mr. P. M.&#8217;s brother, Mr. K. M., the son, Mr. B. M., and two relatives, Mr. S. M. 
</p>
<p>and Mr. B. N. M., allegedly arrived on the scene, physically assaulted the victim and 
</p>
<p>her family, including her husband, and took Mr. P. M. away thereby preventing him 
</p>
<p>from being handed over to the police.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>83. The Investigation Officer of the rape case, Sub Inspector Mr. M.U., submitted 
</p>
<p>the Charge Sheet No. 141 to the Paikgachha Magistrate&#8217;s Cognizance Court under 
</p>
<p>section 9 (1) of the Women and Child Repression Prevention Act-2003. However, in 
</p>
<p>his investigation report, Mr. M.U. submitted the charge against only the alleged 
</p>
<p>perpetrator, Mr. P.M. The assault charges against the other four alleged perpetrators 
</p>
<p>of the assault have been dropped even though the report mentions that while Mr. P.M. 
</p>
<p>was raping the victim, he was apprehended by her family. Later, Mr. P.M.&#8217;s brothers 
</p>
<p>and nephews came to the house, assaulted the victim&#8217;s family members and took Mr. 
</p>
<p>P.M. away. The Superintendent of Police of Khulna district, Mr. M.I. supervised the 
</p>
<p>case in person by visiting the scene and, having interviewed the eyewitnesses, 
</p>
<p>officially forwarded the police investigation report to the court, but failed to identify </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 27 
 
the involvement of the fellow perpetrators. The case has now been forwarded to the 
</p>
<p>Women and Child repression Special Tribunal of Khulna for trial.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>84. As of 6 December 2006, the perpetrators allegedly complicit in the incident 
</p>
<p>have not been arrested or charged. It is alleged that the police officers who dropped 
</p>
<p>the assault charges against the four accomplices might have been bribed. The victim, 
</p>
<p>her family and the case witnesses are subjected to threats. Mr. P.M. is allegedly 
</p>
<p>pressuring the victim to withdraw the case by threatening to use his wealth and 
</p>
<p>influence to bribe the police and ensure that they submit a false &#8220;Final report&#8221;. It is 
</p>
<p>also alleged that Mr. P.M: allegedly also threatened a key witness trying to cause 
</p>
<p>them to make false affidavits in his favour.  
</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>Response from the Government  
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>85. On <b>25 January 2007</b> the Government of Bangladesh acknowledged receipt of 
</p>
<p>the communication and on <b>25 May 2007</b>, it replied to the allegation letter dated 16 
</p>
<p>January 2007 concerning the alleged rape of Mrs. A R M of Paikgacha Police Station, 
</p>
<p>District: Khulna, Bangladesh. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>86. The Government stated that the allegations as referred to have been investigated 
</p>
<p>by concerned agencies in Bangladesh. Mrs. A R M wife of Mr. Z M of village: Kahar 
</p>
<p>Chak, Police station: Paikgacha, district: Khulna lodged an First information Report 
</p>
<p>(F.I.R) against Mr.P M, son of late J N M of the same village at Paikgacha Police 
</p>
<p>Station under section 9 (1) &#8220;women and Children repression Prevention Act 2000( 
</p>
<p>amendment 2003)&#8221; on 25.7.2006. The investigations officer (I.O) of the said criminal 
</p>
<p>case submitted charge sheet (No.141, dated 11.9.2006) against Mr. P M under section 
</p>
<p>8(1) of the said Act in the concerned court. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>87. According to medical expert&#8217;s opinion, there was no sign of forcible sexual 
</p>
<p>intercourse with the victim Mrs. A R M. On 25 January 2007, Mrs. M. declared 
</p>
<p>through an affidavit that she was not raped by Mr. P. M. In her affidavit she also 
</p>
<p>mentioned that there was a dispute between Mr. P. M. and her husband on land 
</p>
<p>property issue. Mrs. M. confirmed that she had only an altercation with Mr. P. M. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 28 
</p>
<p>about the disputed property of her husband. The alleged rape incident is, therefore, 
</p>
<p>categorically ruled out. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>88. The case against Mr. P. M. was under trial in the special Tribunal, Khulna. In 
</p>
<p>the meantime, the alleged accused Mr. P. M. has been granted bail by the Hounorable 
</p>
<p>High Court Division, Dhaka. The victim and the accused will receive fair judgement 
</p>
<p>as guaranteed by the law of the land. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>89. On <b>13 June 2007</b>, the Government sent to the Special Rapporteur a letter with 
</p>
<p>the affidavit signed by Ms. A. R. M. The content of the affidavit correspond to what 
</p>
<p>the Government affirmed in its previous letter to the Special Rapporteur.

<p>91. On<b> 9 November 2007, </b>the Special Rapporteur on Violence against women, 
</p>
<p>jointly with the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right 
</p>
<p>to an adequate standard of living, the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
</p>
<p>indigenous people, sent an allegation letter regarding the human rights situation of the 
</p>
<p>Guarani Kaiow&#225; community of Nhanderu Marangatu, in the state of Mato Grosso do 
</p>
<p>Sul, including recent allegations regarding abuses perpetrated by private security 
</p>
<p>guards contracted by local farmers. The reported abuses against local communities by 
</p>
<p>personnel of private security companies were the subject of a joint communication 
</p>
<p>sent by the Special Rapporteur on the right to food and the Chairperson of the 
</p>
<p>Working Group on the use of mercenaries on 8 November 2007 (BRA 18/2007). 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>A. The legal status of the Nhanderu Marangatu Indigenous Land </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 29 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>92. According to the information received, the Guarani Kaiow&#225; community of 
</p>
<p>Nhanderu Maragantu, integrated by 500 members, has been gradually expelled from 
</p>
<p>their traditional lands in Mato Grosso do Sul by the opening of large commercial 
</p>
<p>farms. Since 1999, they lived in an area of 26 hectares on the margins of road MS 
</p>
<p>384, in tarpaulin shacks, in the access to the ranches Fronteira, Morreo Alto and 
</p>
<p>Cedro. Since 2004, the Guarani Kaiow&#225; started to reoccupy their traditional lands then 
</p>
<p>in hands of private owners, occupying an area of 400 hectares within the boundaries 
</p>
<p>of several private farms.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>93. The Nhanderu Marangatu Indigenous Land was officially recognized by 
</p>
<p>Presidential Decree of 28 March 2005, which ratified the demarcation previously 
</p>
<p>undertaken by the National Indian Foundation (FUNIA) of the Guaran&#237; Kaiow&#225; 
</p>
<p>traditional lands. The land demarcated included an area of 9,317 hectares within the 
</p>
<p>municipality of Ant&#244;nio Jo&#227;o, in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul.   
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>94. The process of official recognition of the Nhanderu Marangatu indigenous land 
</p>
<p>was however suspended by injunction of President of the Federal Supreme Court 
</p>
<p>(STF) on July 2005, in response to an appeal filled by local farm owners, ordering the 
</p>
<p>forceful eviction of the Guarani Kaiow&#225; settlement in the Fazenda.  On 15 December 
</p>
<p>2005, the eviction took place with the support of more than 150 members of the 
</p>
<p>armed forces, including Federal police and military police. During their eviction, 
</p>
<p>several of their properties were set on fire by private security guards contracted by 
</p>
<p>local farmers.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>95. As a result of this eviction, the community was resettled in the earlier location 
</p>
<p>of 26 hectares on the margins of the road MS 384, in precarious conditions. During 
</p>
<p>their resettlement, they reportedly experienced severe shortage of food and water, and 
</p>
<p>unsanitary conditions, and numerous cases of malnutrition and maladies of the 
</p>
<p>community&#8217;s children were reported.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>96. In August 2007, the Guarani Kaiow&#225; community, in the framework of an 
</p>
<p>agreement between the authorities and the local ranchers, returned to occupy 100 </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 30 
</p>
<p>hectares of theirs traditional lands within the area homologated by the Presidential 
</p>
<p>Decree, in order to allow for the asphalting of road MS 384. In their current location, 
</p>
<p>the community awaits the final decision of the courts in order to take possession of 
</p>
<p>their traditional lands, as identified in the 2005 Presidential Decree.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>B. Alleged abuses by private security guards 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>97. In addition, we have received numerous reports regarding alleged human rights 
</p>
<p>perpetrated by private security guards employed by local farm owners against the 
</p>
<p>members of the Guarani Kaiow&#225; community of Nhanderu Marangatu. It is alleged 
</p>
<p>that these abuses have increased after the indigenous community was evicted from 
</p>
<p>their traditional lands on 15 December 2005, and that are committed with the 
</p>
<p>intention of intimidating community members against their attempts to recover their 
</p>
<p>traditional lands.   
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>98. Reported abuses include the killing of Mr. D. R., a 45 years-old Guarani 
</p>
<p>Kaiow&#225;, on 24 December 2005. Mr. D. R. was reportedly shot in cold blood by a 
</p>
<p>security guard employed by the Fronteira farm in the vicinities of the farm, who 
</p>
<p>approached the victim and his two companions in a car, while they were on their way 
</p>
<p>to gather vegetables from their small vegetable garden in preparation for the 
</p>
<p>Christmas festivities.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>99. According to the reports we have received, the reported abuses by security 
</p>
<p>guards have increased since the community moved to their temporal resettlement 
</p>
<p>within the private ranches of Nhanderu Marangatu, in August 2007. Since their 
</p>
<p>resettlement, an approximate of 30 private security guards of the Gaspem company 
</p>
<p>have been contracted by local landowners, have been deployed in the vicinities of the 
</p>
<p>community&#8217;s encampment, leading to a situation of increased tension.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>100. Various episodes of sexual violence against Guarani Kaiow&#225; women by private 
</p>
<p>security guards have been reported. On 12 October 2007, at approximately 10.00 am, 
</p>
<p>a group of four security guards attacked Ms. E. R. and her husband, Mr. V. N., while 
</p>
<p>they were searching for firewood. After the guards battered her husband, Ms. E. R. 
</p>
<p>suffered an attempted rape. During the same day, at approximately 4.00 pm, a similar </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 31 
 
attack was suffered by Ms. S. R. and her husband Mr. A. F. V., in the company of 
</p>
<p>their 9 years-old son.  While Mr. A. F. V. was taken away and was severely beaten by 
</p>
<p>the guards, Ms. S. R. was hit with a rifle butt and thrown to the ground, were she 
</p>
<p>received several blows and was subject to sexual violence, in front of her child. 
</p>
<p>Reportedly, Ms. S. R. eventually managed to escape, but she had to be hospitalized 
</p>
<p>with strong pain on her chest.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>101. In addition, according to the allegations, private security guards have repeatedly 
</p>
<p>harassed the indigenous community, including by firing shots in the air. In this 
</p>
<p>connection, it is reported that, on 5 October 2007, security guards opened fire at a 
</p>
<p>distance of 50 m from the community&#8217;s houses as a form of intimidation. On 30 
</p>
<p>October 2007, security guards fired shots in the air near a group of children while they 
</p>
<p>were playing. Moreover, it has been reported that the personnel of the neighbouring 
</p>
<p>farms have continuously subjected the community to surveillance, taking films and 
</p>
<p>pictures of community members in the distance.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>102. On 31 October, a police patrol reportedly irrupted during a ceremony being 
</p>
<p>performed by the community in homage to the dead. The police&#8217;s operation was 
</p>
<p>allegedly in response to denounces made by local ranchers, which claimed that the 
</p>
<p>community was trying to invade ranch lands. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p><b>Observations  
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>103. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Brazil did not reply to 
</p>
<p>her communication and reiterates her interest in receiving responses from the 
</p>
<p>Government in regard to the allegations submitted and would be particularly 
</p>
<p>interested to know whether these cases have resulted in any prosecutions of alleged 
</p>
<p>perpetrators.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>104. The Special Rapporteur would like to draw the attention of the Government to 
</p>
<p>article 22, paragraph 2, of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
</p>
<p>Peoples which stipulates that States shall take measures, in conjunction with 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples, to ensure that indigenous women and children enjoy the full </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 32 
</p>
<p>protection and guarantees against all forms of violence and discrimination. In 
</p>
<p>addition, the Commission on Human Rights, in its resolution 2005/41 on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination on Violence against Women, calls on States to address the specific 
</p>
<p>circumstances facing indigenous women and girls in relation to gender-based 
</p>
<p>violence, especially sexual violence, arising from multiple, intersecting and 
</p>
<p>aggravated forms of discrimination, including racism, paying particular attention to 
</p>
<p>the structural causes of violence. In this respect the Special Rapporteur recalls article 
</p>
<p>21, paragraph 2, of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
</p>
<p>Peoples, which recognizes that States shall take effective measures and, where 
</p>
<p>appropriate, special measures to ensure continuing improvement of the economic and 
</p>
<p>social conditions of indigenous peoples, and that particular attention shall be paid to 
</p>
<p>the rights and special needs of women, youth and children, among others. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>105. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur would like to stress that the Committee on 
</p>
<p>the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination has referred extensively to the right of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples to own, develop, control and use their communal lands, territories 
</p>
<p>and resources. In this respect, States should make every effort to ensure that no 
</p>
<p>decisions directly relating to indigenous peoples&#8217; rights and interests are taken 
</p>
<p>without their prior informed consent.&#8225;&#8225; Significantly, this implies certain practices 
</p>
<p>aimed at safeguarding rights should be upheld when the State grants companies access 
</p>
<p>to indigenous lands and territories for resources exploitation.

<p>I. Y. S. habr&#237;an sido informados de su muerte, supuestamente ocurrida en el barrio 
</p>
<p>Lleras. Se informa de que los paramilitares tras la petici&#243;n por parte de los familiares 
</p>
<p>de I. Y. S. de la entrega del cuerpo de la v&#237;ctima, respondieron a los familiares de la 
</p>
<p>siguiente manera: &#8220;Esto es para que aprendan a ser novias de guerrilleros, el cad&#225;ver 
</p>
<p>va a permanecer toda la noche amarrado a un poste de la energ&#237;a. Vengan ma&#241;ana y 
</p>
<p>se lo pueden llevar&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>110. Seg&#250;n las alegaciones recibidas, el cuerpo sin vida de I. Y. S. habr&#237;a 
</p>
<p>permanecido toda la noche en la calle, y al d&#237;a siguiente, 25 de agosto, los miembros 
</p>
<p>del grupo &#8220;Las &#193;guilas&#8221; habr&#237;an sacado los &#243;rganos del cad&#225;ver antes de arrojarlo al 
</p>
<p>mar. Se informa adem&#225;s de que cuando los familiares de I. Y. S. habr&#237;an logrado 
</p>
<p>rescatar el cuerpo del mar, habr&#237;an percibido que &#233;ste presentaba heridas de cuchillo 
</p>
<p>por todo el cuerpo. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>111. Se teme que la relaci&#243;n sentimental de I. Y. S. con un miembro de la guerrilla, 
</p>
<p>sea el motivo de su supuesto asesinato

<p><b>Urgent appeal</b> 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>120. On <b>25 January 2007</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
</p>
<p>causes and consequences jointly with the Special Representative of the Secretary-
</p>
<p>General on the situation of human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal to the 
</p>
<p>Government regarding Ms I. J. and Ms V. B.. Ms<b> </b>V. B. was one of six pro-democracy 
</p>
<p>activists who were arrested by the military on the night of 24 December 2006.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>121. According to information received, on 15 December 2006, Commodore V. B., 
</p>
<p>reportedly issued a warning against Ms I. J. and Ms V. B., to &#8216;stop saying things that 
</p>
<p>could incite civil unrest&#8217;, and further implied that if they did not heed his warning the 
</p>
<p>military would take action against them.   </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 36 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>122. Furthermore, on 14 December 2006, Ms I. J.&#8217;s husband, Mr R. S. T., was 
</p>
<p>informed that his contract as Chief Executive Officer of Air Fiji Limited (AFL) would 
</p>
<p>be terminated as of 31 December 2006, under a Directive issued by Commodore V. B. 
</p>
<p>In the same Directive, Commodore V. B. announced that Ms I. J. was to be removed 
</p>
<p>from the Board of Post Fiji (PSL). Ms I. J. refused to accept the legitimacy of her 
</p>
<p>termination as Board member, and responded on 20 December 2006, by conveying 
</p>
<p>her apologies to the Chief Executive for not attending board meetings, as she would 
</p>
<p>be out of the country.  However, on 11 January 2007, Ms I. J. was informed through 
</p>
<p>the FWRM that a travel ban had been issued against her and Ms V. B., preventing 
</p>
<p>both women from leaving Fiji.   
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>123. On 4 December 2006, whilst participating in the annual National Judicial 
</p>
<p>Conference, Ms I. J. reportedly received a call to her mobile phone during which the 
</p>
<p>caller warned her to be careful and threatened to rape her. According to reports the 
</p>
<p>call was traced to a phone booth outside the military barracks in Nabua, Suva.  It is 
</p>
<p>believed that the call was in response to a report published by Ms I. J. in the Fiji 
</p>
<p>Times on 30 November 2006, which criticized the military coup in the country.   
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>124. Concerns were expressed that the series of acts of intimidation and harassment 
</p>
<p>including the dismissal of Ms I. J.&#8217;s husband, as outlined above, form part of an 
</p>
<p>ongoing campaign against human rights defenders in Fiji, and in particular Ms I. J., 
</p>
<p>Ms V. B. and members of the FWRM, the <i>Fiji Women&#8217;s Crisis Centre</i> (FWCC) and 
</p>
<p>the <i>Pacific Centre for Public Integrity</i> (PCPI).  Serious concerns were expressed that 
</p>
<p>the afore-mentioned events, in particular the threat of sexual violence may be the 
</p>
<p>latest attempts to silence women human rights defenders because of their legitimate 
</p>
<p>activities in monitoring the human rights situation in Fiji.

</p>

</p>
<p>on the question of torture and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1

the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the Government 
</p>
<p>regarding Ms. L. D., a Fijian businesswoman. Ms. Digitaki is associated with the pro-
</p>
<p>democracy movement in Fiji for turning her own office into a 'Pro-Democracy Shrine' 
</p>
<p>that has featured quite often in the media. Banners covered the outside of her office 
</p>
<p>with statements such as, &#8220;Democracy is our right&#8221;, &#8220;Yes to Democracy, No to guns&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>&quot;Ballots not bullets&quot; and &quot;By the vote we elect the government by the vote we remove 
</p>
<p>the government&quot;.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>126. According to information received, on Christmas Eve, 24 December 2006, at 
</p>
<p>approximately 23:20, Ms. L. D.&#8217;s home was visited by a group of military soldiers.  
</p>
<p>The soldiers requested that Ms. L. D. accompany them to a military camp for 
</p>
<p>questioning.  She was told that if she did not comply with their request she would be 
</p>
<p>taken by force.  On arrival at the camp Ms. L. D. was escorted through a passageway 
</p>
<p>lined with cells, one of which contained her business partner Mr. I. I.; Ms. L. D. was 
</p>
<p>subsequently detained in a dark cell.  After a period of 20 minutes she was taken from 
</p>
<p>the cell and asked to accompany a number of soldiers to Mr. P. W.&#8217;s house, a friend 
</p>
<p>and fellow pro-democracy supporter.  Ms. L. D. complied with the request.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>127. On her return to the camp, Ms. L. D. was led to a dark hall where Ms V. B., was 
</p>
<p>waiting. Ms. V. B. was the subject of an urgent appeal sent on 25 January 2007 by the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences and the 
</p>
<p>Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders. Ms. L. D. and Ms. V. B. were subsequently subjected to a barrage of verbal 
</p>
<p>abuse and torture, during which Ms. L. D. was threatened at gunpoint and made to lie 
</p>
<p>face down on the ground. After enquiring if she was pregnant, one of the soldiers 
</p>
<p>proceeded to jump on her back.  The ordeal lasted approximately 45 minutes, after 
</p>
<p>which Ms. L. D. and Ms. V. B., along with four other pro-democracy activists, 
</p>
<p>including Mr. I. I. and Mr. P. W., were ordered to run to the camp gate.  The group 
</p>
<p>was followed outside the camp by two military trucks and they were forced to run 
</p>
<p>some distance by the soldiers. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>128. Before returning home, Ms. L. D. passed by her office.  The office had been 
</p>
<p>trashed and raided and the pro-democracy banners which used to cover its outside </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 38 
</p>
<p>were removed. Graffiti was on the wall saying &quot;Merry Xmas Happy New Year Laisa 
</p>
<p>Chang&quot;. (The reference is a derogatory one, referring to one of her male business 
</p>
<p>clients. Ms. L. D. is one of the few businesswomen dealing in a male dominated 
</p>
<p>corporate world in Fiji and she is often accused of sleeping with all her male 
</p>
<p>associates. Similar comments were made by officers while she was in detention on 
</p>
<p>24-25 December 2006). 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>129. Previously on 9 December 2006, a group of armed men broke into the pro- 
</p>
<p>democracy shrine, tearing down banners and damaging the property. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>130. At the time of writing Ms. L. D. in hiding, in order to protect herself from arrest 
</p>
<p>after a statement she made outlining the events of 24 December 2006, was made 
</p>
<p>public, and fears for her physical integrity.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>131. Concerns were expressed that the series of acts of intimidation and harassment, 
</p>
<p>as outlined above, form part of a growing campaign against human rights defenders in 
</p>
<p>Fiji. Serious concerns were expressed that the afore-mentioned events may be the 
</p>
<p>latest attempt to silence Ms. L. D. because of her human rights activities, in particular 
</p>
<p>her pro-democracy stance and defending the right to freedom of expression in Fiji.  
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>132. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Fiji did not reply to any 
</p>
<p>of her communications sent in 2007 and reiterates her interest in receiving responses 
</p>
<p>from the Government in regard to the allegations submitted and would be particularly 
</p>
<p>interested to know whether these cases have resulted in any prosecutions of alleged 
</p>
<p>perpetrators.

<p>- El 23 de febrero de 2006, se recibi&#243; el informe de la Unidad de 
</p>
<p>Especialistas de Escena del Crimen del Ministerio P&#250;blico del Pet&#233;n, el cual 
</p>
<p>contiene fotograf&#237;as de la sede de la Asociaci&#243;n, de las evidencias y de las 
</p>
<p>cuales se concluye que la posible huella de calzado s&#243;lo qued&#243; documentada

<p>por medio de fotograf&#237;as y video, no siendo posible  revelar la huella,  por ello, 
</p>
<p>no se puede establecer el n&#250;mero de la horma de calzado, tipo, marca, peso, 
</p>
<p>estatura de la persona que utiliza ese calzado. En las paletas de vidrio, martillo

</p>
<p>141. El 5 de septiembre de 2006, se recibi&#243; copia del informe de investigaci&#243;n del 
</p>
<p>Servicio de Investigaci&#243;n Criminal de la Polic&#237;a Nacional Civil, en el que se 
</p>
<p>manifiesta que la escena del crimen ya hab&#237;a sido manipulada, por lo que no hab&#237;a

<p>142. El Gobierno inform&#243; que se est&#225;n llevando a cabo las investigaciones oportunas, 
</p>
<p>no habiendo sido a&#250;n posible identificar a los supuestos actores del delito.

</p>
<p>la Asociaci&#243;n, el Gobierno inform&#243; que: 
</p>
<p>- Los miembros de la Asociaci&#243;n de Mujeres, solicitaron medidas 
</p>
<p>cautelares ante la Comisi&#243;n Interamericana de Derechos Humanos. Dado que 
</p>
<p>tales medidas no fueron concedidas, el Estado, decidi&#243; brindarles protecci&#243;n a 
</p>
<p>trav&#233;s del Cuerpo de Polic&#237;a. Actualmente consiste en la presencia de 
</p>
<p>miembros de seguridad en las instalaciones de la Asociaci&#243;n, as&#237; como 
</p>
<p>seguridad perimetral en las residencias de algunos de sus miembros.  
</p>
<p>-  El 10 de noviembre 2005, la Estaci&#243;n Policial de Santa Elena 
</p>
<p>Flores, Pet&#233;n, indic&#243; que se le dio instrucciones para realizar patrullas 
</p>
<p>constantes en la periferia de las instalaciones de la Asociaci&#243;n, agregando que 
</p>
<p>continuar&#225;n vigilando este sector. 
</p>
<p>- La representante de la Asociaci&#243;n de Mujeres indic&#243; que E. C. G. se 
</p>
<p>traslad&#243; de domicilio, por lo que su vida ya no corre peligro.

<p>144. El <b>30 de noviembre de 2007, </b>la Relatora Especial sobre la violencia contra la 
</p>
<p>mujer, con inclusi&#243;n de sus causas y consecuencias, junto con el Relator Especial 
</p>
<p>sobre la venta de ni&#241;os, la prostituci&#243;n infantil y la utilizaci&#243;n de ni&#241;os en la 
</p>
<p>pornograf&#237;a y el Relator Especial sobre los derechos humanos de los migrantes, 
</p>
<p>enviaron una carta de alegaci&#243;n al Gobierno de Guatemala en relaci&#243;n con las 
</p>
<p>adopciones internacionales de miles de ni&#241;os.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>145. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, en Guatemala  alrededor de 5000 y 6000 ni&#241;os 
</p>
<p>ser&#237;an dados en adopci&#243;n cada a&#241;o, convirtiendo a Guatemala en el segundo pa&#237;s del 
</p>
<p>mundo con mayor n&#250;mero de adopciones internacionales, despu&#233;s de China. La 
</p>
<p>demanda internacional provendr&#237;a principalmente de familias estadounidenses, las 
</p>
<p>cuales pagar&#237;an entre 13 y 40 mil d&#243;lares para &#8220;adquirir&#8221; un beb&#233; guatemalteco.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>146. La violencia contra las mujeres ser&#237;a un factor a tener en cuenta, ya que beb&#233;s 
</p>
<p>productos de violaci&#243;n sexual estar&#237;an siendo dados en adopci&#243;n, en donde las madres 
</p>
<p>ser&#237;an coaccionadas o enga&#241;adas para dar al reci&#233;n nacido en adopci&#243;n. La cr&#237;tica 
</p>
<p>situaci&#243;n econ&#243;mica y social en que se encuentran estas mujeres ser&#237;a otro factor que 
</p>
<p>las hacen vulnerables a ser v&#237;ctimas de las redes de ni&#241;os que se dedican a 
</p>
<p>adopciones.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>147. En Guatemala se estar&#237;a llevando a cabo adopciones internacionales ilegales de 
</p>
<p>menores de edad, y en gran parte de los casos, con el enga&#241;o a sus familias. La mayor 
</p>
<p>parte de las adopciones, el 99.7%, se har&#237;a por v&#237;a notarial, teniendo como  base en la 
</p>
<p>Ley Reguladora de Tramitaci&#243;n Notarial de Asuntos de Jurisdicci&#243;n Voluntaria , sin 
</p>
<p>la observancia de los debidos requisitos para asegurarse cual es la procedencia del 
</p>
<p>ni&#241;o/ni&#241;a. La adopci&#243;n por esta v&#237;a no necesitar&#237;a resoluci&#243;n de juez/a competente, el 
</p>
<p>juzgado de familia actuar&#237;a &#250;nicamente para solicitar a la trabajadora social que, bajo 
</p>
<p>juramento, efectuar&#237;a el estudio socioecon&#243;mico respectivo. Las adopciones 
</p>
<p>internacionales por v&#237;a judicial no llegar&#237;an al 0,3  por ciento del total de las 
</p>
<p>adopciones realizadas.  
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 44 
</p>
<p>148. Asimismo se habr&#237;a descubierto que algunos Jueces de Familia habr&#237;an 
</p>
<p>autorizado adopciones sin contar con la opini&#243;n favorable de la Procuradur&#237;a General 
</p>
<p>de la Naci&#243;n, en violaci&#243;n a la legislaci&#243;n existente en la materia. La participaci&#243;n de 
</p>
<p>autoridades judiciales en dichas irregularidades, y el hecho de que los procedimientos 
</p>
<p>para el tr&#225;mite de las adopciones establecidos en las leyes generales est&#225;n en 
</p>
<p>desacuerdo con las leyes especiales de protecci&#243;n a la infancia, demostrar&#237;a la 
</p>
<p>existencia de un cuadro de pr&#225;cticas de violaci&#243;n  de los derechos humanos de la 
</p>
<p>ni&#241;ez. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>149. Seg&#250;n informaci&#243;n obtenida, habr&#237;an organizaciones asentadas en Guatemala 
</p>
<p>que se dedicar&#237;an a la venta ilegal de menores de edad por medio de adopciones 
</p>
<p>internacionales, como ser&#237;a el caso de la &#8220;Casa Quivira.&#8221; Esta organizaci&#243;n tendr&#237;a 
</p>
<p>como dirigentes ciudadanos provenientes de los Estados Unidos de Am&#233;rica y se 
</p>
<p>dedicar&#237;a a la venta de menores de edad a este pa&#237;s cobrando a las futuras familias un 
</p>
<p>precio muy alto por cada uno de ellos. Supuestamente esta organizaci&#243;n habr&#237;a estado 
</p>
<p>involucrada en la pr&#225;ctica de adopciones irregulares, donde 46 ni&#241;os habr&#237;an sido 
</p>
<p>rescatados y repartidos entre instituciones evang&#233;licas y cristianas en el mes de agosto 
</p>
<p>de este a&#241;o. Supuestamente habr&#237;an ocurrido irregularidades en el juicio realizado 
</p>
<p>contra Casa Quivira, por los hechos mencionados, con el objetivo de que dicha 
</p>
<p>organizaci&#243;n saliera impune en relacion a los posibles delitos realizados. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>150. Entre las pr&#225;cticas irregulares de adopci&#243;n se incluir&#237;a la realizada por medio de 
</p>
<p>Alcaldes Municipales, consistente en la entrega de los ni&#241;os/as por parte de su madre 
</p>
<p>biol&#243;gica a una pareja adoptiva. Los padres biol&#243;gicos y los padres adoptivos 
</p>
<p>comparecer&#237;an ante el Alcalde de la localidad, normalmente en zonas aisladas en las 
</p>
<p>cuales no hay acceso a los juzgados o a las oficinas de un abogado,  para que &#233;ste 
</p>
<p>levantara un acta en la que constar&#237;a que los primeros entregan en adopci&#243;n a su hijo. 
</p>
<p>Posteriormente se asentar&#237;a la Partida de Nacimiento en el Registro Civil y el acto de 
</p>
<p>la adopci&#243;n quedar&#237;a consumado. Otra de las maneras ser&#237;a por suposici&#243;n de parto, 
</p>
<p>en donde la madre biol&#243;gica entregar&#237;a al ni&#241;o a los padres adoptivos inmediatamente 
</p>
<p>despu&#233;s del nacimiento. Ambas se internar&#237;an en el mismo sanatorio (privado), la 
</p>
<p>madre biol&#243;gica se registrar&#237;a con el nombre de la madre adoptiva y el ni&#241;o saldr&#237;a de 
</p>
<p>la cl&#237;nica como hijo de la segunda.

</p>
<p>d&#8217;all&#233;gation concernant l'exploitation d'enfants pour le travail domestique en Guin&#233;e. 
</p>
<p>D&#8217;apr&#232;s les informations re&#231;ues : 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>155. En Guin&#233;e, des dizaines de milliers de filles travailleraient comme domestiques. 
</p>
<p>Tandis que d'autres enfants de la famille seraient  scolaris&#233;s, ces filles passeraient leur </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 46 
</p>
<p>enfance et leur adolescence &#224; faire des travaux m&#233;nagers f&#233;minins: elles nettoieraient, 
</p>
<p>laveraient le linge et s&#8217;occuperaient des jeunes enfants. Beaucoup d&#8217;entre elles 
</p>
<p>travailleraient jusqu&#8217;&#224; 18 heures par jour. La grande majorit&#233; d&#8217;entre elles ne seraient 
</p>
<p>pas pay&#233;es ; d'autres recevraient des paiements, souvent irr&#233;guliers, en g&#233;n&#233;ral 
</p>
<p>inf&#233;rieurs &#224; 5 dollars US par mois. De nombreuses filles employ&#233;es comme 
</p>
<p>domestiques ne recevraient aucune aide quand elles seraient malades, et elles auraient 
</p>
<p>souvent faim car elles seraient exclues des repas familiaux. Elles seraient souvent 
</p>
<p>tenues &#224; l&#8217;&#233;cart, insult&#233;es et moqu&#233;es. Beaucoup d&#8217;entre elles seraient aussi victimes 
</p>
<p>de coups et de violence et de harc&#232;lement sexuels. Malgr&#233; ces conditions, quitter la 
</p>
<p>famille de l&#8217;employeur serait difficile pour beaucoup d&#8217;enfants employ&#233;es 
</p>
<p>domestiques qui ne pourraient pas rejoindre leurs parents et n&#8217;auraient pas d&#8217;autre 
</p>
<p>endroit o&#249; aller. Ces filles vivraient dans des conditions analogues &#224; l&#8217;esclavage. 
</p>
<p>Certaines filles viendraient d&#8217;aussi loin que le Mali. Ces adolescentes maliennes en 
</p>
<p>particulier viendraient en Guin&#233;e travailler comme domestiques pour gagner de 
</p>
<p>l&#8217;argent pour leurs trousseaux. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>156. De plus, un nombre important de ces mineurs seraient isol&#233;s dans la maison de 
</p>
<p>leur employeur et seraient incapables d&#8217;acc&#233;der &#224; toute information ou assistance de 
</p>
<p>l&#8217;ext&#233;rieur. Ils resteraient coinc&#233;s pendant des ann&#233;es dans des situations 
</p>
<p>traumatisantes et de maltraitance. Il n&#8217;y aurait pas d&#8217;organisme pour la protection de 
</p>
<p>l&#8217;enfance pour contr&#244;ler de fa&#231;on syst&#233;matique le bien-&#234;tre des enfants et faciliter leur 
</p>
<p>retrait d&#8217;une maison o&#249; ils sont maltrait&#233;s, si n&#233;cessaire; le Minist&#232;re des affaires 
</p>
<p>sociales a la responsabilit&#233; de cette question, mais ne serait pas op&#233;rationnel. Il 
</p>
<p>n&#8217;existerait pas non plus de syst&#232;me de placement en famille d&#8217;accueil qui puisse 
</p>
<p>offrir aux enfants un environnement familial alternatif protecteur et contr&#244;l&#233;. Bien 
</p>
<p>qu&#8217;il existerait un service d&#8217;inspection du travail, il manquerait de personnel et ne 
</p>
<p>s&#8217;occuperait pas de la situation des enfants travaillant comme domestiques. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>157. L&#8217;exploitation et la maltraitance des enfants employ&#233;s comme domestiques 
</p>
<p>constituent une violation du droit national et international. La Guin&#233;e est partie &#224; la 
</p>
<p>Convention relative aux droits de l&#8217;enfant et &#224; tous les principaux trait&#233;s r&#233;gionaux et 
</p>
<p>internationaux sur le travail des enfants, la discrimination selon le sexe et la traite. 
</p>
<p>Selon le droit guin&#233;en, les enfants ont droit &#224; l&#8217;&#233;ducation, et la scolarisation dans 
</p>
<p>l&#8217;enseignement primaire est obligatoire. L&#8217;&#226;ge minimum pour travailler est de 16 ans, </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 47 
 
mais il y aurait une disposition qui pr&#233;voit que les enfants de moins de 16 ans peuvent 
</p>
<p>travailler avec le consentement de leurs parents ou de leurs tuteurs l&#233;gaux. Les enfants 
</p>
<p>de plus de 16 ans sont autoris&#233;s &#224; travailler dans certaines limites, mais doivent 
</p>
<p>b&#233;n&#233;ficier de tous leurs droits du travail. De plus, le droit guin&#233;en prot&#232;gerait les 
</p>
<p>enfants contre les ch&#226;timents corporels et autres violences physiques, les s&#233;vices 
</p>
<p>sexuels, et la traite. Le droit international comporte aussi des interdictions claires 
</p>
<p>contre certains comportements nocifs, pour prot&#233;ger les enfants contre la 
</p>
<p>discrimination, toute forme de  violence, d&#8217;atteinte ou de brutalit&#233; physiques, de 
</p>
<p>mauvais traitements ou d&#8217;exploitation, y compris la violence sexuelle, la traite et les 
</p>
<p>cons&#233;quences nocives du travail des enfants. Il octroie aussi aux enfants le droit &#224; 
</p>
<p>l&#8217;&#233;ducation et &#233;tablit la fa&#231;on dont les devoirs envers les enfants devraient &#234;tre 
</p>
<p>remplis, que ce soit par l&#8217;Etat, les parents, les tuteurs l&#233;gaux ou d&#8217;autres personnes

</p>
<p>horas, J. F. E. fue agredido por cinco desconocidos mientras trabajaba en el barrio 
</p>
<p>rojo habitado por gays y travest&#237;s en Comayag&#252;ela, Tegucigalpa.  Seg&#250;n informes, 
</p>
<p>uno de los individuos habr&#237;a intentado quitarle la peluca antes de arrojarle al suelo y

<p>golpearle.  Seg&#250;n se informa, un coche patrulla de la polic&#237;a habr&#237;a estacionado al 
</p>
<p>lado del lugar donde se ubicaban los profesionales del sexo minutos antes de las 
</p>
<p>22:00 horas. 
</p>
<p>161. Los agentes policiales no solamente habr&#237;an sido testigos de la paliza propinada

<p>169. On <b>9 March 2007</b> the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
</p>
<p>and consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 50 
</p>
<p>prostitution and child pornography, sent an allegation letter to the Government 
</p>
<p>concerning the systematic physical and sexual abuse of girl-children employed as 
</p>
<p>dancers in Orissan folk-opera troupes. It is alleged that the owners and managers of 
</p>
<p>these troupes rely heavily on child labour, particularly on the use of very young girls 
</p>
<p>as dancers. It was alleged that the Banaswari, Niyatti and Sudamvati Troupes are 
</p>
<p>particularly concerned.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>170. According to information received, most of the young girls were aged between 
</p>
<p>ten and sixteen and hired out by their families in return for an advance on their wages. 
</p>
<p>It was further alleged that each troupe employs between ten and twenty of these girls 
</p>
<p>who come from poor families and are paid sub-standard wages. They are reportedly 
</p>
<p>moreover kept in poor living conditions, sleeping only a few hours a day on mats on 
</p>
<p>the floors or sometimes even outside. In one case, a girl had allegedly spent an entire 
</p>
<p>day without eating.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>171. It was reported that these young girls encounter a high level of physical, mental 
</p>
<p>and sexual abuse, including beating and rape. They face sexual harassment and blatant 
</p>
<p>advances from male performers as well as from older actors and management, and 
</p>
<p>due to their vulnerable position, they have oftentimes no choice but to acquiesce. It is 
</p>
<p>alleged that sexual abuse is common in the troupes. The Special Rapporteurs had also 
</p>
<p>received allegation of past managers having raped young girls. It was further alleged 
</p>
<p>that these young girls are also publicly humiliated, slapped and beaten by the opera 
</p>
<p>management or directors for alleged misbehaviour or mistakes.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>172. It is reported that on 17 December 2006, a young girl was publicly beaten by a 
</p>
<p>male manager with a heavy wooden stick. All the girls interviewed, aged from ten and 
</p>
<p>sixteen, admitted to being slapped or beaten with a stick as a form of punishment one 
</p>
<p>to three times a week.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>173. According to information received, these young girls were being exploited, 
</p>
<p>physically and sexually abused and the State of Orissa and the Government of India 
</p>
<p>had not yet taken action on the matter. Though national child labour legislation 
</p>
<p>requires that government inspectors visit any business that uses children to insure that 
</p>
<p>they are not abused, it is reported that there are currently no such inspections of the </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 51 
 
troupes. Furthermore, the Government has hitherto reportedly not placed dancing in 
</p>
<p>the Opera troupes on its list of hazardous employments for children.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>174. On <b>19 November 2007</b>, the government of India sent a reply stating that 
</p>
<p>comprehensive enquiries were undertaken which included visits to the headquarters 
</p>
<p>of Banaswari, Niyatti and Sudamvati folk-opera troupes as well as the sites of their 
</p>
<p>performance; interview with the female artists of the troupes and feedback from the 
</p>
<p>opera visitors as well as the employees engaged in such performances. However, the 
</p>
<p>aforesaid allegations could not be substantiated. The matter was also enquired into by 
</p>
<p>the Labour Commissioner of Orissa through a team of officers having adequate 
</p>
<p>exposure to the modus operandi of the opera parties and their recruitment process, 
</p>
<p>who found the allegation to be without basis. The national Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Commission of India has also been apprised of the findings of the enquiry by the 
</p>
<p>Government of Orissa. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>175. On <b>14 August 2007</b>, Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
</p>
<p>and consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, sent 
</p>
<p>an allegation letter to the Government concerning Ms. A. B., aged 19, daughter of S. 
</p>
<p>H., residing at Lakshmipur, Rajpara, Rajsahi district, Bangladesh.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>176. According to the information received, On 7 June 2007, at 18.45, Ms. A. B. was 
</p>
<p>taken into custody together with Ms. C. K. by Indian Border Security Force (BSF) 
</p>
<p>officers stationed at I &amp; II Outposts at Kargil village, Murshidabad district of West 
</p>
<p>Bengali State, while they were trying to cross the border from Bangladesh to India.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>177. Some hours after being taken into custody, Ms. A. B. was raped by a BSF 
</p>
<p>officer. The incident witnessed by a superior officer of the intelligence branch at the 
</p>
<p>BSF, who were visiting the outpost that day. The superior officer advised Ms. A. B. to 
</p>
<p>visit a doctor and to lodge a complaint at the Raninagar Police Station. However, </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 52 
</p>
<p>when she attempted to do so, the responsible officers refused to register her case and 
</p>
<p>to have a medical examination conducted. Thereafter she was returned to the BSF 
</p>
<p>camp.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>178. On the next day, when Ms. A. B. was taken to Raninagar Police Station, the 
</p>
<p>Senior Divisional Police Officer from Domkal, Mr. M. B. H., ordered that she be sent 
</p>
<p>to the Beharampur District Hospital for a medical examination. However, according 
</p>
<p>to the reports, the BSF put pressure on the medical officer who examined Ms. A. B., 
</p>
<p>Dr. S. B. K., so that the latter declared that she was not raped. No forensic laboratory 
</p>
<p>examination was conducted. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>179. On 9 June 2007, Ms. A. B. and Ms. C. K. had to appear before the Additional 
</p>
<p>Chief Judicial Magistrate in Lalbagh for the hearing of the case against them under 
</p>
<p>the relevant provisions of the Foreigners Act of 1946. The Court issued an order to 
</p>
<p>detain Ms. A. B. and Ms. C. K. in judicial custody.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>180. On 21 June 2007, Ms. A. B.&#8217;s court case commenced. During these proceedings, 
</p>
<p>her lawyer informed the Court that she was raped while in detention.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>181. Concern was expressed that the authorities have failed to exercise due diligence 
</p>
<p>to prevent, investigate and punish the violence against Ms. A. B. and to provide her 
</p>
<p>with the required support and attention, including counselling. <b>

<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>182. On <b>23 August 2007</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
</p>
<p>causes and consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as 
</p>
<p>a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
</p>
<p>intolerance, and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation 
</p>
<p>of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding attacks 
</p>
<p>on the Dalit communities, particularly women, in Somebhadra District, Uttar Pradesh, 
</p>
<p>India. 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 53 
</p><p> 
183. It is reported that in Sonebhadra District, the poorest District in Uttar Pradesh 
</p>
<p>with a large Dalit population, Dalit families have been cultivating and living in a 
</p>
<p>Government&#8217;s waste lands, the Gram Sabha&#8217;s, for years. Reportedly, the land 
</p>
<p>ownership has always been a conflicting issue between the Upper Caste controlling 
</p>
<p>land resources and Dalits and tribes. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>184. Reports indicate that Dalits&#8217; reclaim of land has led to conflicts with forest 
</p>
<p>officials and the Police, especially after the adoption of the &quot;Schedule Tribe and other 
</p>
<p>Forest Dwelling Communities (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act of 2006&quot;. It is 
</p>
<p>further alleged that since the Act is not yet operational, the forest department officials 
</p>
<p>have been harassing the activists working for the rights of the forest dwellers and the 
</p>
<p>tribes, with the aim to ensure that evictions take place before the clauses of the Act 
</p>
<p>are enforced. Reportedly similar actions are taking place in other parts of the country 
</p>
<p>including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Orissa.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>185. In this context, on 3 August 2007, Ms. R. and Ms. S. B., two members of the 
</p>
<p>National Forum of Forest People and Forest Workers (NFFPFW) who have been 
</p>
<p>working in the Sonebhadra District for the past seven to eight years, were arrested in 
</p>
<p>Robertsganj under charges of provoking Dalits and Tibals to encroach forest lands. 
</p>
<p>They were arrested under section 120 (B) and 447 of Penal Code; they were in 
</p>
<p>Mirzapur jail and their bail applications have been rejected at the Circle Judicial 
</p>
<p>Magistrate. On 5 August 2007, L. D. and S. P. were arrested from a local market in 
</p>
<p>Rangarh, they are also in Mirzapur jail. As a consequence of these imprisonments, 
</p>
<p>people have been staging a protest since 4 August in front of the District Magistrate 
</p>
<p>(DM) office in Sonebhadra demanding immediate release of the activists. New 
</p>
<p>charges have been brought against Ms. R. under article 4 of the National Security Act 
</p>
<p>on 10 August.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>186. Reports also indicate that on 10 August 2007, at around 9 p.m., the police 
</p>
<p>attacked Dalit women in Chanduli Village, in Sonebhadra District, leaving fifteen 
</p>
<p>women seriously injured. Two trucks loads of Police along with Upper Caste 
</p>
<p>representatives of the locality descended on Chanduli village in Sonebhadra district. 
</p>
<p>They were allegedly heavily armed, and demanded to see B., an active member of the </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 54 
</p>
<p>local organisation Kaimoor Kshetra Mahila Mazdoor Kisan Sangharsh Samiti 
</p>
<p>(KKMMKSS). According to information received, when they did not find B. in the 
</p>
<p>village, they started attacking women present in the village. Police and upper caste 
</p>
<p>representatives barged into the house of B. and attacked his pregnant sister and sister-
</p>
<p>in-law; pulling them out and attacking them. In three hours, the police and upper caste 
</p>
<p>representatives beat up around 15 women and destroyed their houses.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>187. At the time of the incident, there were very few male members in the village as 
</p>
<p>most of them were staging a protest in front of the DM's office in Sonebhadra against 
</p>
<p>the arrest of Ms. R., Ms. S. B., L. D. and S. P.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>188. This was allegedly the third attack of this kind against Dalits in less than two 
</p>
<p>weeks and reportedly a consequence of the Dalits families&#8217; requests for land that 
</p>
<p>started in the last two years, as a response to the forest department&#8217;s Government 
</p>
<p>Resolution of 2002-3 to clear forest lands from any encroachments. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>189. During the events, the police reportedly left the village giving an ultimatum to 
</p>
<p>remove the bricks of the houses by 11 August 2007, or they would come back with 
</p>
<p>the administrative order to destroy the houses.

</p>
<p>190. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government for its reply to her 
</p>
<p>communication of 9 March 2007. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur regrets that 
</p>
<p>the Government of India did not reply to any other communications sent in 2007 and 
</p>
<p>2006.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>191. The Special Rapporteur reiterates her interest in receiving responses from the

</p>
<p>

<p>193. According to the information received: On 4 March 2007, the Iranian authorities 
</p>
<p>arrested at least 31 women, seven of whom were released on bail on 6 March 2007. 
</p>
<p>Ms. A. A., Z. B. Y., M. A., M. H., S. L., M. H., J. J., Z. P., M. M., N. K., M. M., N.

</p>
<p>still remain in detention. A number of these women have allegedly gone on a hunger 
</p>
<p>strike. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>194. The women had staged a peaceful demonstration against the prosecution of 
</p>
<p>several women, who had been charged with criminal offences against public order 
</p>
<p>and security for having organized a peaceful women&#8217;s demonstration in Haft-e Tir 
</p>

<p>women&#8217;s rights defenders who have publicly expressed their views on numerous 
</p>
<p>occasions. Reportedly, all of the detained women have been transferred to Ward 209 
</p>
<p>of the Evin Prison in Teheran. Allegedly, police officers also broke the teeth of Ms. 
</p>
<p>N. J. by banging her head against the door of a police bus. Serious concern was

<p>expressed that the arrest and detention of the aforementioned women human rights

<p>the Government had already released other women arrested on 4 March 2007. 
</p>
<p>However, the Special Rapporteur remained gravely concerned about information 
</p>
<p>indicating that Ms. M. A. and Ms. S. S. remain in detention in Section 209 of Evin

</p>
<p>incommunicado since her arrest. Ms. S. S.&#8217;s outside contact was limited to two

<p>disclosed to them or their lawyers. It was also feared that the women do not receive

</p>
<p>16,000 women who were showing too much hair or wore a headscarf deemed too

<p>Several of these women&#8217;s rights activists have already been subject to an urgent

<p>2007, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary 
</p>
<p>Detention.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>201. According to the latest information received: on 7 May 2007, Ms. Z. P., Ms. M. 
</p>
<p>H. and Ms. F. G. were summoned to court for their participation in a peaceful 
</p>
<p>demonstration on 4 March 2007. The demonstration was directed against the 
</p>
<p>prosecution of women activists in connection with a peaceful women&#8217;s demonstration 
</p>
<p>that took place on 12 June 2006 in Haft-e Tir Square of Tehran and was addressed in 
</p>
<p>an urgent appeal we transmitted to your Excellency&#8217;s Government on 16 June 2006. 
</p>
<p>Ms. Z. P. reported to the Revolutionary Court after receiving a summons, where she 
</p>
<p>was then arrested and transferred to Evin prison. Ms. Z. P. was released on bail on 17 
</p>
<p>May 2007.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>202. On 24 April 2007, the Sixth Branch of the Revolutionary Court in Tehran 
</p>
<p>sentenced Ms. N. A. K., Ms. S. E. and Ms. P. A. in connection with the peaceful 
</p>
<p>demonstration of 12 June 2006 to three years&#8217; imprisonment for &#8220;collusion and 
</p>
<p>assembly to endanger the national security,&#8221; under article 610 of the Islamic Penal 
</p>
<p>Code. The court ordered Ms. N. A. K., Ms. S. E. and Ms. P. A. to serve six months in 
</p>
<p>prison, but suspended the remaining two-and-half years of their sentences. The same 
</p>
<p>court sentenced two other women&#8217;s rights advocates to prison terms on 18 April 2007 
</p>
<p>in relation to same demonstration. Ms. F. D. M. was sentenced to four years&#8217; 
</p>
<p>imprisonment, of which three years were suspended, and Ms. S. T. was sentenced to 
</p>
<p>two years&#8217; imprisonment, of which 18 months were suspended. The women, currently 
</p>
<p>free, are expected to appeal against their sentences. The same day, Ms. B. H., a 
</p>
<p>university student, was reportedly also tried, without the presence of her lawyer, due 
</p>
<p>to her participation in the demonstration of 12 June 2006. On 26 May 2007, she was 
</p>
<p>reportedly sentenced to a two-year suspended sentence for &#8220;acting against national 
</p>
<p>security by participating in an illegal gathering.&#8221;  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>203. On 11 April 2007, Branch 15 of the Revolutionary Court in Tehran gave Ms. A. 
</p>
<p>F., a university student, a two-year suspended sentence in connection with the 
</p>
<p>demonstration of 12 June 2006 for &#8220;acting against national security by participating in 
</p>
<p>an illegal gathering.&#8221; Several days later, she was summoned to court where she was 
</p>
<p>questioned and informed that she was facing new charges in connection with a </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 59 
 
peaceful gathering on 4 March 2007 held to protest against the prosecution of activists 
</p>
<p>in connection with the demonstration in June 2006.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>204. On this occasion, the Special Rapporteurs expressed their appreciation that Ms. 
</p>
<p>M. H. Z. and Ms. N. K. have been released on bail on 15 April 2007. The two women 
</p>
<p>were arrested on 3 April 2007 while collecting signatures in support of the &#8220;Million 
</p>
<p>Signatures Campaign&#8221; to abolish laws that discriminate against women. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteurs had already communicated their concerns in relations to this case in an 
</p>
<p>urgent appeal dated 5 April 2007. The Special Rapporteurs remained concerned that 
</p>
<p>the charges against the two women have reportedly not been dropped and that they 
</p>
<p>may be prosecuted at a future point in time.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>205. Concern was expressed that the arrests and sentencing of the aforementioned 
</p>
<p>activists may be solely related to their peaceful activities in defence of women rights 
</p>
<p>and could form part of wider pattern of harassment against women rights activists.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal  
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>206. On <b>5 July 2007</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes

</p>
<p>protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>on the question of torture, and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
</p>
<p>the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the government 
</p>
<p>regarding Ms. D. A., a women's rights defender from Tehran University. According to 
</p>
<p>information received: 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>207. The Tehran Revolutionary Court convicted Ms. D. A. on charges of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Propaganda against the System&#8221; and &#8220;Disturbing Public Order&#8221; for having 
</p>
<p>participated in a peaceful demonstration for a better recognition of women's rights and 
</p>
<p>to remove discriminatory clauses against women from Iranian law, which took place 
</p>
<p>in Haft Tir Square on 12 June 2006. Ms. D. A. was sentenced to two years and 10 
</p>
<p>months imprisonment and 10 lashes. The sentence has not been suspended and could 
</p>
<p>be carried out at any time. Reportedly, several other persons arrested during the </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 60 
</p>
<p>demonstration have also been convicted and sentenced, but had their sentence 
</p>
<p>suspended. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>208. In an urgent appeal dated 16 June 2006, to which the Government responded by 
</p>
<p>letter dated 15 August 2006, the Special Rapporteurs have already expressed their 
</p>
<p>concern that Iranian security forces had arrested Ms. D. A. and others during the 
</p>
<p>demonstration of 12 June 2006. The Special Rapporteurs have reiterated their concern 
</p>
<p>that the conviction of Ms D. A. may be related to her peaceful activities in defence of 
</p>
<p>women's rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>209. The Special Rapporteurs urged the Government to ensure that Ms. D. A. will 
</p>
<p>not be subjected to any punishment, including the cruel, inhuman and degrading 
</p>
<p>punishment of lashing, for having exercised her right to freedom of expression. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteurs were particularly concerned that the execution of the lashing 
</p>
<p>sentence may be imminent.

<p>the Government regarding Ms. R. S.. Ms. R. S. is a campaigner for women&#8217;s rights 
</p>
<p>and a member of the One Million Signatures campaign, which calls for an end to 
</p>
<p>discriminatory laws against women in Iran. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>211. According to information received, on 8 October 2007, Ms. R. S. participated in 
</p>
<p>an event to mark the International Day of the Child during which she collected 
</p>
<p>signatures for the One Million Signatures campaign.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>212. On 9 October 2007, nine agents of the security forces entered the home of Ms. 
</p>
<p>R. S. and seized literature pertaining to the One Million Signatures campaign, her 
</p>
<p>computer as well as some other personal belongings. Ms. R. S. was arrested shortly

</p>
<p>detention as all efforts on the part of family members to contact her have as yet failed.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>213. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Ms. R. S. may be 
</p>
<p>directly related to her peaceful human rights activities, in particular her work to 
</p>
<p>defend and promote women&#8217;s rights in Iran. In view of her incommunicado detention, 
</p>
<p>further concern was expressed with regard to her physical and psychological

<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>214. On <b>30 November 2007</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
</p>
<p>causes and consequences sent an allegation letter to the Government regarding the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Family Protection Draft Bill&#8221; No.36780/68357 dated 22 July 2007. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>215. According to information received, the Government of Iran recently submitted a 
</p>
<p>Family Protection Draft Bill to Parliament, with the alleged aim of matching the 
</p>
<p>current legal framework with today&#8217;s realities. It appeared that the Head of the Legal 
</p>
<p>Commission within Parliament stated at the time of writing that the bill would be 
</p>
<p>open to discussion in the Parliament. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>216. Allegedly, the &#8220;Family Protection Draft Bill&#8221;, instead of upholding women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights within the family, reverses rights currently enjoyed by women. In addition, the 
</p>
<p>law reinforces the unequal legal power of men within the family. The Bill contains 
</p>
<p>various articles which may violate women&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>217. First, under Iranian&#8217;s civil code and its 1992 amendments, women have a very 
</p>
<p>limited right to divorce, as they must extensively justify their request for divorce 
</p>
<p>(such as on the basis of their husband&#8217;s addiction, violence, etc) to prove that they are 
</p>
<p>eligible to be divorced. Articles 17, 21, 26 and 31 of the &#8220;Family Protection Draft 
</p>
<p>Bill&#8221;, would make it even more difficult for women to obtain the divorce: 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 62 
</p>
<p>218. Article 17 establishes Family Counselling Centres. The aim of these centres is 
</p>
<p>to consolidate the foundations of the family and prevent an increase in family dispute, 
</p>
<p>in particular divorce. The Family court will have the obligation to ask the opinion of 
</p>
<p>the family counselling centres.  According to article 21, these centres will be made up 
</p>
<p>of experts on Family studies, law, Islamic canon, and foundations of Islamic law. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>219. Article 26 plans that registration of divorce by official offices shall be 
</p>
<p>authorized only upon the issuance of a certificate stating the impossibility of 
</p>
<p>reconciliation. The family counselling centre must give a certificate indicating the 
</p>
<p>couple&#8217;s agreement upon divorce.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>220. Article 31 states that the court will first require reconciliation and arbitration 
</p>
<p>before pronouncing the divorce. When one of the partners is unable to bring an 
</p>
<p>arbitrator, the court shall, at the request of the party or directly, appoint an arbitrator 
</p>
<p>from the qualified members of the Family Counselling Centres.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>221. The above articles set different stages before the pronouncing of the divorce, 
</p>
<p>which decreases the likelihood of obtaining a divorce. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>222. Further, article 23 of the&#8221; Family Protection Draft Bill&#8221;, would allow a man to 
</p>
<p>marry up to four wives provided he can testify of his good financial capability and 
</p>
<p>promises to the court to treat all wives equally. The current legal framework sets 
</p>
<p>limitations to men having only a second wife, based on the permission of the first wife 
</p>
<p>and justified by the first wife&#8217;s specific health conditions, such as infertility. The 
</p>
<p>husband&#8217;s second marriage without the consent of his first wife is a ground to get 
</p>
<p>divorce. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>223. Article 2 of the Draft Bill provides that the Family Court will consist of three 
</p>
<p>judges; it does not mandate for the presence of a female judge but only stipulates 
</p>
<p>that a female judge be present if feasible. Given the current context of dominance of 
</p>
<p>men within the Iranian judiciary, it is very likely that most family courts will be 
</p>
<p>composed of three male judges.  
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 63 
</p><p> 
224. In addition, article 25 allows the Government to charge women taxes for the 
</p>
<p>portion of the money that belongs to them (&#8220;Mahriehs&#8221;). The Finance Ministry will be 
</p>
<p>required to annually declare a suggested amount of Mahriehs and such marriage 
</p>
<p>nuptials that exceed that amount will be subject to taxation during their registration. 
</p>
<p>This means that young brides will be faced with paying taxes on a dowry that they 
</p>
<p>may never receive. Iranian women generally do not receive their dowries unless their 
</p>
<p>husbands die or divorce them.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>225. Article 46 of the Bill further provides that an Iranian woman cannot marry a 
</p>
<p>Muslim foreigner without the permission of the Government. If a marriage happens 
</p>
<p>without governmental permission, the woman, her father, the registrar, and the 
</p>
<p>husband will be punished to prison from 91 days to 1 year. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>226. The Special Rapporteur expressed her concerns that the provisions of the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Family Protection Draft Bill&#8221; would put women in an increased situation of 
</p>
<p>inequality and discrimination within the family. Concerns were further expressed that 
</p>
<p>women victims of violence would be afforded fewer avenues for protection as it 
</p>
<p>would be more difficult for them to divorce on grounds of violence perpetuated 
</p>
<p>against them.

<p>229. According to information received, on 18 November 2007, Ms. M. H. was 
</p>
<p>arrested when she reported to a branch of the Revolutionary Court in Tehran for 
</p>
<p>questioning following a summons that had been issued to her. She has reportedly been

<p>&#8220;publication of lies&#8221;, as a result of articles posted on a website of which she is the

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>230. Concern was expressed that the arrest of Ms. M. H. and the accusations that

<p>have been made against her may be directly related to her peaceful human rights

<p><b>Response from the Government to a communication sent in 2006 
</b></p>
<p>234. On <b>20 November 2006</b> the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
</p>

</p>
<p>women&#8217;s rights activist from Haweeja who was the head of the women&#8217;s rights 
</p>
<p>organization Maternity and Childhood. Concern was expressed that Ms. F. A. J. was 
</p>
<p>murdered because of her activities in the promotion and defence of women's human 
</p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>236. The government of Iraq replied to the letter dated on <b>18 June 2007</b>. It stated 
</p>
<p>that on 2 November 2006 formal statements were taken from the complainants, 
</p>
<p>namely, the victim&#8217;s husband A. al S. S. H. and her brother M. A. H.. They requested

</p>
<p>and that a complaint against the perpetrators of the offence be brought as soon as their

</p>
<p>239. It was rumoured that Ms. L. T. S. had begun a romantic relationship with Mr. E. 
</p>
<p>K., even though her family had planned to marry her to a cousin. These were 
</p>
<p>reportedly seen as a stain on the honour of the T. B. family, especially since the boy

<p>belonged to a family of lower social status.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>240. On 10 August 2006, E. K. and his friend G. S. allegedly came to visit L. T. S. at

<p>242. L. T. S., E. K. and G. S. continued their flight to Mosul to hide at the house of 
</p>
<p>an acquaintance. However, that acquaintance was repeatedly threatened to either 
</p>
<p>surrender the three teenagers to the T. B. family or see several of his relatives 
</p>
<p>murdered. On 11 August 2006, the acquaintance took the three teenagers to Shalalat 
</p>
<p>checkpoint in Mosul and handed them over to a group of armed men allegedly led by 
</p>
<p>E. T. B. The men took the three teenagers to Baathree village, close to Ain Sefni. 
</p>
<p>Reportedly, L. T. S.&#8217;s father H. T. S. was already present in the village along with 
</p>
<p>about fifty armed men affiliated with the T. B. family.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>243. With a crowd of local villagers watching, the armed men first broke E. K.&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>hands and legs and gouged his eyes out. Thereafter, they shot him dead, riddling his 
</p>
<p>body with bullets. Subsequently, G. S. and then L. T. S. were shot dead. It is alleged 
</p>
<p>that several influential members of the T. B. family directly took part in the planning 
</p>
<p>and the execution of the murders.  
</p>

</p>
<p>formally investigated, indicted or arrested in connection with the crimes.

<p>In its letter the Government informed that:  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>248. On 23 April 2005 the investigation department of the Issyk-Kul district internal 
</p>
<p>affairs office of Issyk-Kul province of Kyrgyzstan instituted criminal proceedings on 
</p>
<p>the basis of evidence of an offence contrary to article 129, paragraph 1 (Rape), of the 
</p>
<p>Code of Criminal Procedure of the Kyrgyz Republic. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>249. In accordance with the requirements of Kyrgyz criminal procedural legislation, 
</p>
<p>a police line-up of suspects was held, during which Ms. R. G. D. identified Mr. S. A. 
</p>
<p>A. Forensic medical and biological examinations were ordered. Subsequently, Mr. D. 
</p>
<p>K., an investigator of the district internal affairs office repeatedly took unwarranted 
</p>
<p>decisions to terminate criminal proceedings against Mr. S. A. A. on the grounds of 
</p>
<p>lack of sufficient evidence. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>250. The Issyk-Kul district procurator&#8217;s office made a recommendation to the Issyk-
</p>
<p>Kul provincial internal affairs office concerning investigator D. D. K.; as a result, Mr. 
</p>
<p>D. K. was subjected to a disciplinary measure, which took the form of a reprimand. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>251. On 20 December 2006, Mr. S. A. A. was indicted for the commission of an 
</p>
<p>offence contrary to article 129, paragraph 1, of the Code of Criminal Procedure and 
</p>
<p>was placed under house arrest. On 23 December 2006, Mr. S. A. A. was arrested and, 
</p>
<p>on the basis of article 94 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, placed in pre-trial 
</p>
<p>detention. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>252. On 21 December 2006, the criminal case involving the rape of Ms. R. G. D. was 
</p>
<p>referred to the Issyk-Kul inter-district court, where it was being heard at the time of 
</p>
<p>the response. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>253. With regard to the enquiry concerning &#8220;bride-kidnapping&#8221; in Kyrgyzstan, the 
</p>
<p>following information was provided: In 2006, 73 statements and communications 
</p>
<p>from citizens concerning the coercion of women into marriage were registered. With 
</p>
<p>regard to 57 of the reported incidents, investigators of internal affairs offices took 
</p>
<p>decisions not to institute criminal proceedings because citizens withdrew their original 
</p>
<p>statements. </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>254. Criminal proceedings were instituted in connection with the remaining 16

<p>incidents. The results of investigations of nine incidents were referred to the courts (in 
</p>
<p>five cases, the courts handed down the verdict of guilty; four cases are still being

</p>
<p>trafficked to Malaysia. It was reported that there were cases of pregnant Indonesian 
</p>
<p>women being trafficked to Malaysia for the purpose of selling their child after it is 
</p>
<p>born for illegal adoptions. Further, some specific situations were brought to the 
</p>
<p>attention of the Special Rapporteurs:  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>- In 2002 the Malaysian police were said to have uncovered at least 20 cases 
</p>
<p>of baby selling in Sarawak, East Malaysia; among these it is reported the rescue of six </p>

</p>
<p>Indonesian women and four babies in Kuching and of eight babies and four women in 
</p>
<p>Sibu. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>- In September 2003 a fishing boat heading towards Malaysia was allegedly 
</p>
<p>intercepted. According to information received, on this boat, eight babies were found 
</p>
<p>packed in Styrofoam in fish boxes which were punctured in order to allow the babies 
</p>
<p>to breath.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>- On 17 September 2003, a 22 year-old woman from Central Java, Indonesia, 
</p>
<p>was lured from Indonesia to Malaysia with the prospect of a good job, but actually she 
</p>
<p>became a victim of trafficking in human beings. The woman was over five months 
</p>
<p>pregnant. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>257. On <b>29 May 2007</b> the Government replied to the letter sent on 18 May 2004. It 
</p>
<p>stated that trafficking in persons, particularly women and children, was a serious 
</p>
<p>problem in the Asian region exacerbated by an increasing involvement of organized 
</p>
<p>criminal groups. To this end, on 26 September 2002, Malaysia signed the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and ratified it on 24 
</p>
<p>September 2004. At the time of writing, Malaysia was in the process of tabling a Bill 
</p>
<p>in Parliament criminalising the offence of trafficking in Malaysia, thus affording more 
</p>
<p>protection to victims of the crime. Among others, the legislation would provide 
</p>
<p>necessary shelters and relevant mechanisms, in keeping with the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>258. As regarding the allegations regarding the cases the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s letter 
</p>
<p>referred to, the following was reported: 
</p>
<p>- On 20 June 2002, a Royal Malaysian Police team rescued six Indonesian 
</p>
<p>women and four babies in Kuching. The police arrested a couple (Mr. B. J. L. 
</p>
<p>M. and Mrs. J S. H.). The suspected were charged in court for the offence of 
</p>
<p>harbouring illegal immigrants and afterwards released on court bail of RM 
</p>
<p>10,000 with two sureties each. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 71 
 
</p>
<p>- On 25 June 2002, the police rescue three babies and three children in Sibu. 
</p>
<p>There is no information of any woman being rescued. One police report 
</p>
<p>alleged that three arrests were made (Mr. L. S. K., Mr. W. T. H. and Mr. L. Y. 
</p>
<p>M.). The investigation paper was sent to the Deputy Public Prosecutor and on 
</p>
<p>3 October 2003, instructions were given to conclude investigations as there 
</p>
<p>was no evidence to show that the babies had been legally adopted by the 
</p>
<p>suspects. The rescued babies were handed over to the Sibu Welfare 
</p>
<p>Department on the order of the Court which adjudicated the matter. Another 
</p>
<p>police report was lodged concerning two young girls aged two and six years 
</p>
<p>old respectively and a boy aged 4 years old who were found in Sibu. Three 
</p>
<p>arrests were made (Mr. L. K. S., Ms. H. P. H. and Ms. I. J.).  The suspects in 
</p>
<p>this case were initially remanded but then they have been released 
</p>
<p>unconditionally as there was no supporting evidence to prove that the children 
</p>
<p>had been kidnapped or smuggled. The charges against them were withdrawn. 
</p>
<p>As for the children, they were initially taken into temporary custody and 
</p>
<p>placed at a shelter by the Social Welfare Department. The children were 
</p>
<p>subsequently released into the custody of Ms. H. P. H. on the instructions of 
</p>
<p>the Court as there was supporting evidence to show that the children had been 
</p>
<p>legally adopted by her. At the time of writing they lived under her care and 
</p>
<p>custody. 
</p>
<p>- On 22 August 2003, in Johor, the police saw a boat docking at a jetty and a 
</p>
<p>man carrying a white Styrofoam box. The man (Mr. A. Abd. R.) was detained 
</p>
<p>and it was subsequently discovered that the box contained two babies. An 
</p>
<p>accomplice (Mr. I. S.) was later arrested on 31st August. Both suspects were 
</p>
<p>charged of unlawful transfer of possession, custody or control of child and 
</p>
<p>importation of child by false pretenses. The Court impose a fine of RM 5,000 
</p>
<p>in default 12 months&#8217; imprisonment against Mr. A. Abd. R., who was placed 
</p>
<p>behind bars, having failed to pay the fine. Mr. I. S. was charged in Court but 
</p>
<p>the charges were withdrawn on the instructions of the Public Prosecutor due to 
</p>
<p>insufficient evidence. However, action under preventive detention was taken 
</p>
<p>against him. The babies rescued were handed over to the Indonesian Consulate 
</p>
<p>on 22 October 2003. </p>

<p>venta de ni&#241;os, la prostituci&#243;n infantil y la utilizaci&#243;n de ni&#241;os en la pornograf&#237;a y el 
</p>
<p>Representante Especial del Secretario-General para los defensores de los derechos 
</p>
<p>humanos, enviaron un llamamiento urgente al Gobierno de M&#233;xico en relaci&#243;n con la 
</p>
<p>Sra. L. C. R., periodista y defensora de derechos humanos, directora y fundadora del 
</p>
<p>Centro Integral de Atenci&#243;n a las Mujeres (CIAM) en Canc&#250;n, una organizaci&#243;n no-
</p>
<p>gubernamental que se dedica a la provisi&#243;n de refugio y apoyo para las v&#237;ctimas de 
</p>
<p>violencia familiar, violencia sexual, y trata.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>271. De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida: El 7 de mayo de 2007, hacia las 12:20 
</p>
<p>horas, la Sra. L. C. R. lleg&#243; de Ciudad Ju&#225;rez al Aeropuerto Internacional de la 
</p>
<p>Ciudad de M&#233;xico acompa&#241;ada de tres personas de la Agencia Federal de 
</p>
<p>Investigaciones (AFI) que la escoltan a ra&#237;z de las amenazas de muerte que habr&#237;a 
</p>
<p>recibido por su trabajo. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>272. La Sra. L. C. R., tres periodistas y los tres agentes viajaban del aeropuerto en 
</p>
<p>un veh&#237;culo Suburban, propiedad de la Procuradur&#237;a General de la Rep&#250;blica. 
</p>
<p>Despu&#233;s de viajar cinco kil&#243;metros, entre Viaducto y Eje Central (Ciudad de 
</p>
<p>M&#233;xico), el veh&#237;culo comenz&#243; a perder el control y el ch&#243;fer tuvo que detenerlo.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>273. Al bajar del veh&#237;culo, los agentes habr&#237;an encontrado que la llanta y la rueda 
</p>
<p>estaban a punto de salirse. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, los agentes de AFI 
</p>
<p>consideraron que el problema del veh&#237;culo habr&#237;a sido provocado deliberadamente 
</p>
<p>para causar un accidente. La Sra. L. C. R. habr&#237;a denunciado oficialmente el incidente 
</p>
<p>ante la polic&#237;a, exigiendo una investigaci&#243;n exhaustiva de lo sucedido.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>274. La Sra. L. C. R. es autora del libro &#8220;Los demonios de Eden: El poder detr&#225;s de 
</p>
<p>la pornograf&#237;a infantil&#8221;, en el cual denuncia a la mafia de la pederastia en M&#233;xico, 
</p>
<p>implicando a varios personajes p&#250;blicos.  En 2004, la Sra. L. C. R. habr&#237;a sido 
</p>
<p>acusada de difamaci&#243;n y a ra&#237;z de estas acusaciones fue detenida en diciembre de </p>

</p>
<p>2005. En 1999 fue v&#237;ctima de una violaci&#243;n, un acto de intimidaci&#243;n con la intenci&#243;n 
</p>
<p>de advertirle de los peligros de seguir con sus investigaciones sobre los cr&#237;menes de 
</p>
<p>violencia sexual en M&#233;xico. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>275. Se expresa profunda preocupaci&#243;n por la seguridad e integridad f&#237;sica de la Sra. 
</p>
<p>L. C. R.y se teme que estos eventos puedan estar relacionados con la actividad en 
</p>
<p>defensa de los derechos humanos de la Sra. L. C. R., en particular su participaci&#243;n en 
</p>
<p>la protecci&#243;n de los derechos de las mujeres y de los ni&#241;os en M&#233;xico.

</p>
<p>Atenco, Estado de M&#233;xico, que mantuvieron bloqueada la carretera Lecher&#237;a- 
</p>
<p>Texcoco. Estos eventos tuvieron como antecedente un conflicto pol&#237;tico entre las 
</p>
<p>autoridades municipales y grupos de vendedores e individuos pertenecientes al 
</p>
<p>movimiento social arriba mencionado. Durante las protestas, varios manifestantes se 
</p>
<p>enfrentaron de forma violenta a los cuerpos policiales del Estado de M&#233;xico. Los 
</p>
<p>agentes de la Polic&#237;a Federal Preventiva y la Agencia de Seguridad Estatal 
</p>
<p>reaccionaron haciendo un uso de la fuerza aparentemente excesivo. Seg&#250;n informes, 
</p>
<p>unos polic&#237;as caminaron sobre personas que estaban acostadas y esposadas. Dos 
</p>
<p>personas, entre ellos un menor de 14 a&#241;os, fallecieron a consecuencia de los disturbios 
</p>
<p>sin que hasta la fecha se hayan esclarecido las circunstancias de las muertes. Las

<p>fuerzas de seguridad detuvieron a 211 personas, incluidas 47 mujeres. Las mujeres 
</p>
<p>ten&#237;an entre 18 y 40 a&#241;os. Durante su detenci&#243;n fueron objeto de diversas 
</p>
<p>modalidades de violencia sexual, f&#237;sica y/o verbal. Al menos 23  de ellas reportaron 
</p>
<p>agresiones sexuales, tales como pellizcos y mordidas en los senos, violaci&#243;n por v&#237;a 
</p>
<p>vaginal y anal con dedos y otros objetos y violaci&#243;n por v&#237;a oral. Los polic&#237;as tambi&#233;n 
</p>
<p>ejercieron violencia sexual al amenazar verbalmente con la violaci&#243;n y al utilizar un 
</p>
<p>lenguaje altamente discriminatorio relativo a la condici&#243;n sexual de las mujeres 
</p>
<p>detenidas. A algunas mujeres les quitaron la ropa violentamente. En contravenci&#243;n a 
</p>
<p>lo dispuesto en los art&#237;culos 129 y 130 del C&#243;digo de Procedimientos Penales del

</p>
<p>empleados del Centro quitaron algunas prendas de vestir a unas mujeres y a otras las

<p>287. On <b>9 March 2007</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
</p>
<p>causes and consequences, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working 
</p>
<p>Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture 
</p>
<p>sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding Ms. R. N., Ms. C. N. R., Ms. N. H. 
</p>
<p>D. and Ms. P. R., four girls aged between 14 and 16 years from Kachin State 
</p>
<p>reportedly detained at Putao Prison, Kachin State.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>288. According to information received: In early February 2007, the four girls were 
</p>
<p>gang-raped by three army officers and four soldiers from a Government military base 
</p>
<p>of the State Peace and Development Council. The alleged perpetrators belong to 
</p>
<p>Infantry Battalion No. 138, based in Munglang Shidi, Putao District, Kachin State.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>289. Army officials reportedly gave money to the girls and their parents to induce 
</p>
<p>them not to report their case to the police. However, in late February, the incident was 
</p>
<p>reported by an independent news agency. After the information was released, the four

on minority issues, sent a letter of allegation concerning reports of widespread and 
</p>
<p>systematic violence against women and girls in Myanmar. The Special Rapporteurs 
</p>
<p>used this opportunity to express their regret that, at the time of writing, they had not 
</p>
<p>received any reply to this letter. This is of particular concern in view of the fact that 
</p>
<p>they continue to receive allegations that such practices continue.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>292. According to information received: Military forces continue to commit rape in 
</p>
<p>several regions, including Karen/Kayin, Mon, Shan and Chin. Over the last 18 months, 
</p>
<p>125 cases of rape have been reported in Karen areas, and about 30 cases of rape 
</p>
<p>against women and minor girls have been reported in Chin areas. The soldiers 
</p>
<p>committing rape display extreme violence, sometimes torturing and murdering their 
</p>
<p>victims.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>293. The Special Rapporteurs would like to reiterate their concern that the reported 
</p>
<p>cases indicate a trend of sexual violence which is particularly alarming, bearing in 
</p>
<p>mind that the above figures reflect only cases of rape that have been reported. Real 
</p>
<p>numbers may be much higher due to the fact that many women do not report incidents 
</p>
<p>of sexual violence because of the trauma and stigma attached it. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteurs were also concerned that sexual violence seems to be particularly 
</p>
<p>endemic in areas of Myanmar where ethnic minorities live. They had, moreover, not 
</p>
<p>been informed about any attempts by the Government of Myanmar to identify, 
</p>
<p>prosecute and punish the perpetrators and bring them to justice. Therefore, they were 
</p>
<p>concerned that sexual violence and the consistent and continuing pattern of impunity 
</p>
<p>have contributed to an environment conducive to the perpetuation of violence against 
</p>
<p>women and girls.

<p>294. The Special Rapporteur regrets not having received any reply to her 
</p>
<p>communications sent in 2007 and reiterates her interest in receiving a reply from the

<p>Government in regard to all allegations submitted, particularly given the alleged 
</p>

</p>
<p>causes and consequences jointly with the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, 
</p>
<p>especially women and children, sent to the Government an allegation letter 
</p>
<p>concerning Ms. B. E., a 28-year old woman from Dalanzadgad Soum, Umnugobi 
</p>
<p>Province.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>296. According to information received: When Ms. B. E.&#8217;s husband left for the 
</p>
<p>Republic of Korea in search of work, she and her son remained in Mongolia. Ms. B. E. 
</p>
<p>earned a low salary at the Mon-Fresh Co.Ltd, a local business. Ms. M., a resident of 
</p>
<p>Erel Building 46, Apt.26, Bayanzurkh District, offered Ms. B. E. to accompany her to 
</p>
<p>Beijing to work as her assistant. Ms. B. E. assumed that she worked as a translator in 
</p>
<p>Beijing.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>297. Ms. B. E. accepted the offer and placed her son with her mother. Before their 
</p>
<p>departure to Beijing in April 2006, Ms. M. gave Ms. B. E. a loan of 300.000 Tugrik. 
</p>
<p>Ms. M. and Ms. B. E. took the train to Beijing, crossing the border in Erlyan.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>298. Upon their arrival in Beijing, Ms. M. demanded that Ms. B. E. to repay the loan 
</p>
<p>of 300.000 Tugrik and forced her to work as a prostitute at a bar called &#8220;DEN&#8221; to 
</p>
<p>repay her debt. Ms. B. E. did not speak Chinese and had never been to Beijing. Ms. M. 
</p>
<p>also took away her passport, money and all phone numbers of friends and family 
</p>
<p>members. Furthermore, Ms. M. reportedly beat Ms. B. E. when she refused to have 
</p>
<p>sex with men, and threatened that she would call her family and friends and inform 
</p>
<p>them that she was working as prostitute.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>299. On 19 April 2006, Ms. B. E. escaped, taking her passport with her. On 1 May 
</p>
<p>2006, she returned to Mongolia with the help of two men, who also gave her 2500 
</p>
<p>Yuan to help her. Allegedly, Ms. M. called Ms. B. E. from Beijing and threatened that 
</p>
<p>if she did not pay her a sum of 200.000 Chinese Yuan she would inform everyone that 
</p>
<p>Ms. B. E. had worked as prostitute. On 5 May 2006 Ms. M. called again threatening </p>

<p>300. On 10 May 2006, Ms. B. E. went to the police and filed a criminal complaint 
</p>
<p>alleging that she had been trafficked to Beijing where she had been sexually exploited. 
</p>
<p>However, on 28 May 2006, the Prosecutor closed the investigations into her case 
</p>
<p>stating that Ms. B. E. had not been sold to a buyer as required by the definition of 
</p>
<p>trafficking contained in article 113 of the Mongolian Criminal law. The prosecutor 
</p>
<p>reportedly also took the position that the main alleged perpetrator and essential 
</p>
<p>witnesses lived outside of Mongolia so that the case was outside the jurisdiction of the 
</p>
<p>Mongolian authorities.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>due to her involvement in, albeit forced, prostitution.

<p>causes and consequences jointly with the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, 
</p>
<p>especially women and children, the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child 
</p>
<p>prostitution and child pornography; and the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of 
</p>
<p>migrants, sent an allegation letter to the Government concerning the trafficking in 
</p>
<p>women and children for purposes of sexual exploitation and forced labour to 
</p>
<p>Mozambique, and through and from Mozambique to South Africa.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>304. According to the information received: From Maputo, women and children are 
</p>
<p>reportedly trafficked via Ressano Garcia or the Lebombo border to Gauteng, in South 
</p>
<p>Africa. Another route used for trafficking of persons to South Africa, specifically to 
</p>
<p>Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal, is the border at Ponta do Ouro. The trafficking of these 
</p>
<p>persons continues further either to the south of Swaziland and directly to 
</p>
<p>Johannesburg and Pretoria, or south to Durban and Pietermaritzburg. It is estimated 
</p>
<p>that approximately 1000 Mozambican women per year are trafficked along these 
</p>
<p>routes. Reportedly, children are also trafficked daily in trucks through the Kruger 
</p>
<p>National Park or the Swaziland border. Mozambicans from the north are trafficked 
</p>
<p>into South Africa via Zimbabwe. It is further alleged that people being trafficked from 
</p>
<p>the Great Lakes Region and East Africa enter the north of Mozambique via Malawi or 
</p>
<p>Tanzania. Mozambican ports are also said to be a stopping point for traffickers 
</p>
<p>travelling by sea, who then continue the journey overland to South Africa.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>305. It is moreover reported that small-scale trafficking networks, based at transit 
</p>
<p>houses in the border region between Mozambique, Swaziland and South Africa, use 
</p>
<p>minivan taxis to smuggle both migrants and trafficking victims across the border. 
</p>
<p>Accomplices in Johannesburg, Maputo and in the Lebombo region in South Africa 
</p>
<p>reportedly assist this process through recruiting, accommodating and transferring 
</p>
<p>migrants and trafficked persons to the final destinations. Organized groups of 
</p>
<p>Mozambican refugees living legally in South Africa are also reported to be involved 
</p>
<p>in such activities.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>306. In this context, young women attempting to find work in South Africa are 
</p>
<p>allegedly led to believe that they will be offered employment as waitresses or 
</p>
<p>domestic workers. However, upon arrival at the said transit centres the women are 
</p>
<p>separated from others, and forced into prostitution or forced labour in agriculture, 
</p>
<p>manufacturing or service industries. When subjected to forced labour, reports indicate 
</p>
<p>that they are often subject to sexual abuse by their employers. Reports also indicate 
</p>
<p>that young women and girls are sold, at the transit centres in Tonga and Johannesburg 
</p>
<p>in South Africa, as &#8220;wives&#8221; to South African men. There are reports of &#8220;stocks&#8221; of 
</p>
<p>women being displayed and of the possibility of &#8220;wives&#8221; ordered on demand.  
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 85 
</p><p> 
307. Trafficked children are reportedly sold for 30 to 50 US $ per child. Orphans are 
</p>
<p>particularly vulnerable to trafficking, particularly because of a reported practice of 
</p>
<p>informal adoption of children and because of adoption laws alleged to facilitate their 
</p>
<p>trafficking. There is an estimated 1.6 million orphans in Mozambique, of whom 
</p>
<p>380,000 have lost their parents due to HIV/AIDS.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>308. Moreover, AIDS is reported to play a major role in increasing the demand for 
</p>
<p>the trafficking of younger and presumably uninfected sex workers. Extreme poverty 
</p>
<p>may also render women and children more vulnerable to being trafficked.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>309. So far, no suspected trafficker has ever been tried for trafficking in persons, but 
</p>
<p>instead under laws related to kidnapping, corruption of minors and hijacking. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that trafficking through several unguarded borders is 
</p>
<p>facilitated by the complicity or the tolerance of some border authorities.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>310. The Government of Mozambique has been undertaking considerable efforts to 
</p>
<p>combat trafficking, including through the establishment of a National Campaign 
</p>
<p>against Child Abuse. On 20 September 2006, the United Nations Convention against 
</p>
<p>Transnational Organized Crime and the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress 
</p>
<p>and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children were ratified. A 
</p>
<p>national anti-trafficking law to ensure domestic implementation of the Protocol has 
</p>
<p>yet to be adopted, however. At the time of writing, efforts to do so were reportedly at 
</p>
<p>an advanced stage, and public debates had been held in several regions. The final draft 
</p>
<p>law would reportedly be presented to the Council of Ministers in the near future and 
</p>
<p>will be discussed during the March session of the Parliament.

<p>in Calcutta and Mumbai, India. The full details of the allegations submitted have been

</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>313. By a letter dated <b>23 January 2007</b>, the Government of Nepal sent a &#8220;Brief 
</p>
<p>outline of the Efforts made by the Government of Nepal in addressing the problem of 
</p>
<p>trafficking of women and children&#8221;. This document, after a detailed introduction on 
</p>
<p>the Government&#8217;s commitment in fighting trafficking of women and children, states 
</p>
<p>that there are no specific empirical studies carried out by the Government of Nepal to 
</p>
<p>ascertain the statements made in the Special Rapporteurs&#8217; letter. However, legal 
</p>
<p>arrangements have been made to curb such activities. The Trafficking in Persons 
</p>
<p>(Control) Act, 1987, incorporates provisions of harsh penalty and imprisonment to the 
</p>
<p>perpetrators of such crime (up to 20 years of imprisonment and Rs. 200,000.00 
</p>
<p>penalty). It also provided an extra-territorial jurisdiction in such cases allowing 
</p>
<p>indicted person to be prosecuted in the Court of Nepal wherever the crime may have 
</p>
<p>been committed. Any of the police offices in Nepal can accept the complaint of such 
</p>
<p>cases. The principle of strict liability is applied, under which the statement of the 
</p>
<p>victim or the plaintiff is considered as strong evidence against the defendant who has 
</p>
<p>to prove his/her innocence. Cases under this Act are investigated and prosecuted by

case as an example of the sensitivity in the interpretation of laws on trafficking from 
</p>
<p>the victims&#8217; perspective.

<p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>315. The Government affirmed that the above table shows that perpetrators have 
</p>
<p>been identified and penalised by decisions of the court. In case where sufficient 
</p>
<p>evidence proves that alleged person is involved in the trafficking of person, s/he is 
</p>
<p>kept in judicial custody during the prosecution of the case. Even when the court of 
</p>
<p>first instance acquits an accused, the Office of Government Attorney files appeal to 
</p>
<p>the Higher Court for the review of the verdict. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>316. Furthermore it is reported that investigation and prosecution of every individual 
</p>
<p>case takes place after the complaint is lodged. This may follow necessary physical and 
</p>
<p>medical examinations as per the nature of the case and condition of the victim, which 
</p>
<p>is determined by the investigating officer. The investigating officer, in co-ordination 
</p>
<p>with the Office of the District Government Attorney files the case to the competent 
</p>
<p>court for the adjudication of the case. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>317. Moreover, the Government declared to have established a rescue/emergency 
</p>
<p>fund in some districts which are considered as major transit points of trafficking. As 
</p>
<p>regards to the efforts to undertake necessary rehabilitation of the returned girls and 
</p>
<p>women, in view of the need for special care and protection of the victims of crimes 
</p>
<p>related to trafficking, MWCSW has run a &#8220;women self-reliance and rehabilitation 
</p>
<p>home&#8221; since 1998. Several NGOs in co-operation with the Government have been </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 88 
</p>
<p>providing shelter and training for the rehabilitation and provided means of livelihood 
</p>
<p>to such victims in different parts of the country. The existing laws provide for the 
</p>
<p>establishment of a rehabilitation fund to run social rehabilitation centre for the victims 
</p>
<p>of trafficking. A committee for the overall co-ordination of the activities with 
</p>
<p>different stakeholders is also envisioned. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>318. Finally, the Government assured that there were instances of compensation to 
</p>
<p>the victims. Half of the penalty amount accrued from the convicted criminal of 
</p>
<p>trafficking is awarded to the victim or her/his minor children, in case the victim has

<p>already died.

<p>allegation letter to the Government concerning alleged human rights violations 
</p>
<p>committed by members of the Maoist party against a lesbian couple, 16 year-old D. 
</p>
<p>(N.) C., from the Village-Tarahara Ward No.-08, and 20 year-old S. C<b>.</b>, from Village-
</p>
<p>Pakali Ward No.-1. Both women belong to a low caste in the Sunsari district of Terai, 
</p>
<p>the marginalized area of East Kathmandu, where the Communist Party of Nepal 
</p>
<p>(Maoist) is exercising delegated authority.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>322. According to information received, the two young women started living 
</p>
<p>together in the beginning of 2006. They have been hiding in different places since 
</p>
<p>their respective families do not approve of their lesbian relationship. Ms. D. C. was 
</p>
<p>forcibly returned by her parents to her family home on several occasions, most 
</p>
<p>recently on 22 March 2007. Her parents and her brother (who is a Maoist) informed 
</p>
<p>the Maoists about their relationship in order to encourage them to discontinue their 
</p>
<p>lesbian relation and lifestyle.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>323. In October 2006, Ms. D. C. and Ms. S. C. were abducted and held in the Maoist 
</p>
<p>camp in Lochani village in Morang District. At the camp, the Maoists called the 
</p>
<p>couple derogatory names for homosexuals including &#8220;chakka&#8221; and &#8220;hijara&#8221; and 
</p>
<p>ordered the girls to join the Maoist party and undergo the training for Maoist militia. 
</p>
<p>As the young women refused to join the Maoist party and carry weapons, they were 
</p>
<p>allegedly beaten, verbally abused, and deprived of food almost everyday. After being 
</p>
<p>detained for almost one month, they managed to escape from the camp and went into 
</p>
<p>hiding.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>324. On 2 March 2007, the women were allegedly abducted again by the Maoists 
</p>
<p>from Pakali village when they were on their way to celebrate the annual Hindu Holi 
</p>
<p>festival in Pankali village in Sunsari district.  
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 90 
</p>
<p>325. The women were taken into custody at the Maoist camp in Singiya village, 
</p>
<p>Sunsari district. They were intensively interrogated about whether they were 
</p>
<p>homosexuals. During their interrogation they were told that their blood should be 
</p>
<p>tested in order to find out whether they are lesbian or not. The women were released 
</p>
<p>after ten hours on the condition that they return with staff from the Human Welfare 
</p>
<p>Society to their parents. Human Welfare Society was allegedly also summoned to the 
</p>
<p>Maoist camp and subjected to part of the interrogation. Since the parents did not come, 
</p>
<p>the Maoists allegedly informed the girls that they would talk to their parents 
</p>
<p>separately and contact them soon again.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>326. On 9 April 2007, the couple filed an official complaint to the Nepal National 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Commission. Their complaint is registered as number 3403.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>327. At the time of the writing, the couple was hiding, living under difficult 
</p>
<p>economical conditions, surviving on daily labour but are allegedly frightened to go to 
</p>
<p>work due to that their family members or Maoists may find them and abduct them 
</p>
<p>again.

<p>concerning human rights defenders Ms. R. M. and Ms D. K. M., members of the 
</p>
<p><i>Women&#8217;s Rehabilitation Centre </i>(WOREC), in the Siraha district. WOREC is a non-
</p>
<p>governmental organization working on social justice and human rights, specifically 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s rights, and the rights of marginalized groups in Nepal such as the Dalits. Ms 
</p>
<p>R. M. and Ms D. K. M. have been involved in documenting cases of violence against 
</p>
<p>women and providing support to victims for several years. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>329. According to information received: On 14 June 2007, at approximately 
</p>
<p>13.00 pm, the offices of WOREC were surrounded by between 60 to 70 men who 
</p>
<p>warned staff working at the time that if they did not leave the village within five days 
</p>
<p>they would be raped and killed. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1

<p> 
</p>
<p>330. On 2 June 2007, at approximately 11.50pm, unidentified assailants attacked the </p>
<p><i>WOREC</i> office with sharp bricks. Staff working at the centre at the time, went outside 
</p>
<p>to investigate and were met with a barrage of bricks before the assailants absconded. 
</p>
<p>No serious injuries were sustained in the attack however staff claimed they felt their 
</p>
<p>lives were being threatened. The police were called after the attack but allegedly 
</p>
<p>maintained that they could not come to the scene of the attack for security reasons but 
</p>
<p>assured staff that they would investigate the case the following morning.  A few days 
</p>
<p>later the main gate of WOREC was dismantled and thrown onto the road. Those 
</p>
<p>responsible were identified as the alleged perpetrators in the rape cases mentioned 
</p>
<p>below.   
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>331. During the months of April and May 2007, Ms. R. M. and Ms. D. K. M. 
</p>
<p>documented two cases involving the attack and rape of two local women. They also 
</p>
<p>assisted the women in registering their claims with the police and obtaining legal and 
</p>
<p>medical advice. Ms. R. M. and Ms. D. K. M. have been challenged on numerous 
</p>
<p>occasions by members of the Govindapur community, in the Siraha district, for their 
</p>
<p>activities in defence of human rights, however since April their situation has 
</p>
<p>deteriorated considerably. Ms. R. M. has reportedly been threatened with death, rape 
</p>
<p>and kidnapping, and in one incident an alleged perpetrator in one of the 
</p>
<p>aforementioned rape cases, threatened her by saying that he &#8216;had unleashed a man 
</p>
<p>who would rape any woman and who will raise sensitive issues so the women should 
</p>
<p>stay alert&#8217;. The Govindapur community has also strongly criticised Ms. R. M. and Ms. 
</p>
<p>D. K. M. for taking the cited cases to the police instead of settling them within the 
</p>
<p>community.   
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>332. Concern was expressed that the aforementioned events are directly related to the 
</p>
<p>work of Ms. R. M. and Ms. D. K. M. in defence of human rights, in particular their 
</p>
<p>involvement in making public the cases of two female rape victims in the Govindapur

<p>shop that belongs to Mr. R. S.&#8217;s brother, and raped her. Subsequently, the two police 
</p>
<p>constables took Ms. K.K. to the residence of another police constable from Mahakali 
</p>
<p>Zonal police, Mr. J. M., and left her there with Mr. J. M.&#8217;s wife, Ms. R. M.  In the 
</p>
<p>evening, Mr. J. M. and his nephew Mr. T. D. came to the house and proceeded to rape 
</p>
<p>Ms. K.K. throughout the night.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>335. Mr. J. M.&#8217;s wife, Ms. R. M., was at home when the rape occurred. On the 
</p>
<p>morning following the rape, Ms. R. M. tore off Ms. K.K. clothes, accusing her of 
</p>
<p>wanting to become her husband&#8217;s second wife. Later that day, Ms. R. M. took her to 
</p>
<p>the Zonal Police Office. After a preliminary investigation Ms. K.K. and Ms. R. M. 
</p>
<p>where referred to the District Police Office. One of the police officers who initially 
</p>
<p>interviewed Ms. K.K. was a man. Subsequently Ms. K.K. was taken to Mahakali 
</p>
<p>Zonal Hospital in Kanchanpur for a medical examination, which confirmed that she 
</p>
<p>had been raped.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>336. Ms. K.K. was bleeding for several days from her uterus after the incident. The 
</p>
<p>doctors who examined the victim prescribed medication for her physical injuries 
</p>
<p>however, no counselling or specific protection measures have been provided to Ms. 
</p>
<p>K.K.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>337. Mr. R. S., Mr. T. D. and Ms. R. M. were arrested on 5 June 2007. They have 
</p>
<p>been charged with rape by the District Court, and remain in detention. The two other 
</p>
<p>perpetrators, police constables Mr. H. C. and Mr. J. M., are still at large despite the </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 93 
 
arrest warrants issued against them. All three police constables have been suspended 
</p>
<p>from their jobs.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>338. Welcoming the investigative steps that the authorities have already undertaken, 
</p>
<p>we urge the Government to ensure that all perpetrators are brought to justice without 
</p>
<p>unnecessary delay. We also call on the Government to ensure that the child victim 
</p>
<p>receives all necessary mental and physical health care; to protect her and her family 
</p>
<p>from possible reprisals; and to compensate her for the violations she reportedly 
</p>
<p>suffered at the hands of state agents on duty.

<p> 
</p>
<p>340. On <b>24 August 2007</b>, Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
</p>
<p>and consequences sent an allegation letter to the Government concerning Ms. B. G. 
</p>
<p>C., aged 15, permanent resident of Ramghat Village Development Committee, ward 
</p>
<p>number 8, Surkhet District, Nepal.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>341. According to information received, On 19 July 2007, Ms. B. G. C. was on her 
</p>
<p>way home from Latikoili on a micro bus, when Mr. R. N. B., a soldier working in 
</p>
<p>Midwestern Divisional Army Headquarter, Banke district, and Mr. Y. T., a civilian 
</p>
<p>friend of Mr. R. N., sat down next to her and began questioning her. After learning 
</p>
<p>Ms. B. G. C&#8217;s name and address, the two men followed her off the first bus, and tried 
</p>
<p>to persuade her to take a separate vehicle home with them, as they insisted they lived 
</p>
<p>nearby.  When Ms. B. G. C. got on a second bus, the men followed her. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>342. Allegedly, Mr. R. N., and Mr. Y. T. then convinced Ms. B. G. C. to get off the 
</p>
<p>bus and join them for some food.  As soon as they were off the bus, Mr. Y. T. grabbed </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 94 
</p>
<p>her and dragged her to the ground, threatening her that she would be killed if she 
</p>
<p>made any noise. Ms. B. G. C. was then violently attacked by both men. Mr. Y. T. raped 
</p>
<p>her first, while Mr. R. N. watched; subsequently Mr. R. N., raped her as well, 
</p>
<p>following which, the men left her naked on her own. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>343. Ms. B. G. C. got on a bus and happened to be seated next to a nurse from the 
</p>
<p>Bheri Zonal Hospital, who sent her to an NGO, Maiti Nepal, in Nepalgung. Maiti 
</p>
<p>Nepal took her for a medical examination, with the help of the District Police Office 
</p>
<p>(DPO) in Banke district. The statement she gave to this DPO was then forwarded to 
</p>
<p>the DPO in Surkhet.  The next day Ms. B. G. C. was taken to the Bheri Zonal Hospital 
</p>
<p>for another medical examination, which concluded that she had been raped.   
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>344. On 3 August 2007, Ms. B. G. C., with the help of the NGO Advocacy Forum, 
</p>
<p>filed a First Information Report (FIR) against the assailants with the DPO in Surkhet. 
</p>
<p>While the DPO officers initially refused to register the report, presumably due to the 
</p>
<p>involvement of army personnel, they finally accepted it. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>345. The DPO in Surkhet requested that the Mid-Western Divisional Army 
</p>
<p>Headquarters hand Mr. R. N., over to the police for investigation, which they did on 9 
</p>
<p>August. He is currently in police custody. The district court approved an extension of 
</p>
<p>his detention for seven days starting from 13 August in order to complete 
</p>
<p>investigations.   
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>346. An arrest warrant has been issued for Mr. Y. T., but he has not been arrested yet 
</p>
<p>and has reportedly fled the area. The Special Rapporteur expressed concern that there 
</p>
<p>were fears for the safety of Ms. B. G. C. for reasons of personal security, as Mr. Y. T. 
</p>
<p>has not yet been arrested.

<p>Government regarding Ms. U. D. B., member of the &#8220;Badi Adhikari Sangharsa 
</p>
<p>Samiti&#8221; (Badi community Struggle Committee), and women and male human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders of the Badi community in Nepal. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>349. According to information received, on 22 August 2007, three dozen women 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders from the Badi community<b> </b>were reportedly beaten and 
</p>
<p>detained in custody. They were protesting in Singha Durbar, in Kathmandu. Allegedly, 
</p>
<p>the aim of their protestation was the rehabilitation of women who have been forced to 
</p>
<p>work as commercial sex workers, the right to own land, the equal representation of 
</p>
<p>male and female candidates in the constituent assembly, and the establishment of legal 
</p>
<p>bodies at all levels of the government addressing issues as racial discrimination, 
</p>
<p>untouchability and legal identity for their children who are deprived of citizenship 
</p>
<p>certificates.  All the protestors were released later on that day without being charged. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>350. On 27 August 2007, 450 Badi women and men (225 of them were women from 
</p>
<p>the Badi Community Struggle Committee and members of the Dalit Civil Society 
</p>
<p>Movement) protested to enter in Singha Durbar. They were beaten with truncheons by 
</p>
<p>the police. Reportedly, the police tried to take off the clothes of Ms. U. D. B., the 
</p>
<p>coordinator of the Badi community Struggle Committee. 120 protestors were arrested 
</p>
<p>by the police. Ms. U. D. B. and other women human rights defenders of the Women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rehabilitation centre (WOREC) were taken to the Armed Police Battalion number-2 in 
</p>
<p>Maharajgunj. They were released in the evening without charge against them. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>351. On 7 September, members of the Badi Community protested again in front of 
</p>
<p>Singha Durbar. They were severely beaten by the police. On 9 September, during 
</p>
<p>another protest in Harihar Bhawan, members of the Badi community were beaten by 
</p>
<p>the police with sticks and boots. The police also poked sticks into people&#8217;s organs. 
</p>
<p>One of the victims is P. B., 18 years old, whose intestine was badly damaged. </p>

<p>355. By letter dated 28 June 2007, the Special Rapporteur notified jointly with the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children and, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants that they had received </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 97 
 
information regarding the case of Ms. <b>T.A.T</b> reportedly a trafficking victim of 
</p>
<p>Ukrainian origin.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>356. According to the information received, Ms. T.A.T was born in Ukraine. She was 
</p>
<p>reportedly trafficked to Auckland, New Zealand in 2003. Ms. T.A.T is married to a 
</p>
<p>citizen of New Zealand. They had a child born in 2005, who is therefore also a citizen 
</p>
<p>of New Zealand. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>357. According to information received, in 2003, Ms. T.A.T was deceived by 
</p>
<p>unknown persons residing in the Ukraine into believing that papers had been arranged 
</p>
<p>for her to work lawfully as a waitress in New Zealand. Upon her departure from 
</p>
<p>Ukraine to New Zealand, she was told by her traffickers in Ukraine that she would be 
</p>
<p>travelling with a false passport. When she protested against this, she was warned that 
</p>
<p>she already owed her traffickers the sum of US$ 5,000 for her ticket to New Zealand 
</p>
<p>and for arrangements undertaken to provide her with a visa and temporary residence 
</p>
<p>permit for New Zealand. She was also threatened that if she refused to comply with 
</p>
<p>instructions, her family in Ukraine would suffer.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>358. Information received also indicated that she flew to New Zealand via Bangkok 
</p>
<p>in the company of a man. Once in Bangkok, she was informed that she would fly to 
</p>
<p>New Zealand alone but that she would immediately be met with a man at the airport 
</p>
<p>who would take care of her from then on. Upon arrival at Auckland Airport, this man, 
</p>
<p>took away her passport and took her to an apartment in a nightclub in Auckland, 
</p>
<p>where she was sold to a group of men who forced her to work as a prostitute. There 
</p>
<p>were two other Ukrainian women in that same apartment who had also found 
</p>
<p>themselves in her same situation and who had also been brought to New Zealand 
</p>
<p>under similar circumstances of false promises. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>359. It is also reported that, Ms. T.A.T and the women she lived and worked with, 
</p>
<p>were never allowed to leave the apartment, except for once a week to buy their 
</p>
<p>weekly groceries; on such occasions, they were always accompanied. The women 
</p>
<p>were given very little food and when Ms. T.A.T fell ill during her captivity the 
</p>
<p>traffickers were reluctant to let her see a doctor.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 98 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>360. Six months after Ms. T. A. T. arrived in New Zealand, the nightclub was 
</p>
<p>suddenly closed down and the traffickers who had forced her to work as a prostitute 
</p>
<p>left the premises. It is alleged that, she was nevertheless still forced to continue 
</p>
<p>working as a prostitute by the man who had initially met her at the airport upon her 
</p>
<p>arrival in New Zealand, claiming that she had still not repaid her debt. Ms. T.A.T and 
</p>
<p>the two other women, however, managed to escape from the flat and went into hiding. 
</p>
<p>It is then that Ms. T.A.T met the man who later became her husband. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>361. It is further alleged that, at that stage, Ms. T.A.T sent an application to the 
</p>
<p>immigration authorities to obtain a residence permit. Her husband also wrote to the 
</p>
<p>Immigration Office to support his wife&#8217;s application, stressing that Ms. T.A.T had not 
</p>
<p>voluntarily used false documents to enter New Zealand, but had been forced by her 
</p>
<p>traffickers to do so. The immigration authorities nevertheless issued Ms. T.A.T with a 
</p>
<p>Removal Order, arguing that they found no substantial evidence of Ms. T.A.T's actual 
</p>
<p>identity.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>362. Reports indicated that the authorities argued that she had committed a serious 
</p>
<p>offence in using false documentation to enter the country and was therefore advised to 
</p>
<p>make arrangements to leave the country voluntarily; otherwise she would be arrested 
</p>
<p>and deported.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>363. In order to respond to the authorities&#8217; request for identification, Ms. T.A.T 
</p>
<p>managed to obtain copies of her birth certificate and her Ukrainian identity 
</p>
<p>documentation from Ukraine. On 29 March 2007, Ms. T.A.T launched an appeal 
</p>
<p>against the Removal Order, in accordance with Section 130 of the Immigration Act of 
</p>
<p>1987.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>364. Finally, according to information received, investigations into the cases of the 
</p>
<p>other Ukrainian women who were allegedly trafficked together with Ms. T.A.T are 
</p>
<p>reportedly underway. Ms. T.A.T's house was searched and questioned as part of such 
</p>
<p>ongoing investigations. It is reported that a number of the traffickers had been 
</p>
<p>convicted but that some of the trafficked women had already been sent away from 
</p>
<p>New Zealand. Other traffickers, including the man who met her at the airport, </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 99 
 
allegedly remained at large. Moreover, Ms. T.A.T claims that this man and other 
</p>
<p>members of the group that trafficked her to New Zealand were threatening her 
</p>
<p>because they know that she is giving information to the authorities. She fears that she 
</p>
<p>would face a risk to her life, if she were returned to the Ukraine. 
</p>

<p>concerning Mr. G. Z., a lawyer and Director of a private firm in Beijing, his wife Ms. 
</p>
<p>G. H., their children aged 13 years and two years and his 70 year old mother in law. 
</p>
<p>Concerns were expressed for the physical and physical and psychological integrity of 
</p>
<p>Mr. G. Z. as it is feared that he may be subject to torture or ill- treatment while in 
</p>
<p>detention. Concern was also expressed that the charges against him may be fabricated 
</p>
<p>and may represent an attempt to prevent him and deter others from carrying out

<p>legitimate legal work in defence of human rights. Further concerns were also 
</p>
<p>expressed for the safety of his family, particularly his family, his wife, Ms. G. H. and

<p>him and recorded his incitements to subvert the authority of the State. Those had been 
</p>
<p>recorded by the foreign media as audio files and placed on their websites, for other 
</p>
<p>people to listen to or download. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>375. During investigation, Mr. G. Z. made candid confession to the facts of these 
</p>
<p>offences, and of his own initiative provided information about other people who has 
</p>
<p>committed extensive offences. This information contained important leads which 
</p>
<p>checked out and helped in solving other criminal cases. On 22 December 2006, the 
</p>
<p>Beijing city people&#8217;s intermediate court No.1 ruled that Mr. G. Z.&#8217;s conduct 
</p>
<p>constituted the offence of incitement to subversion of the authority of the State, but in 
</p>
<p>view of his meritorious conduct in denouncing the offences of culprits, decided in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the law, that his penalty should be rendered more lenient and reduce 
</p>
<p>it below the statutory level. Thus for the offence of incitement to subversion of the 
</p>
<p>authority of the State, he was sentenced to three years fixed term, to be suspended for 
</p>
<p>five years, and stripped of his political rights for one year. After the court handed 
</p>
<p>down its judgement at first instance, Mr. G. Z. declared himself willing to accept the 
</p>
<p>verdict and did not lodge an appeal. The judgement has since become enforceable. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>376. In the course of proceedings against Mr. G. Z. on the charge of incitement to 
</p>
<p>subversion of the authority of State, the public security authorities fully upheld his 
</p>
<p>rights in litigation and those of his family and conducted the proceedings in strict 
</p>
<p>compliance with the law, applying the law in a civilized manner. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 102 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>377. Three days before proceedings opened in this case, the court of first instance, in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the stipulation of the law, notified the prosecutor&#8217;s office and the 
</p>
<p>defence counsel and published in advance the dates and venue of the trial. When the 
</p>
<p>court rendered its judgement, Mr. G. Z.&#8217;s family were present in the public gallery. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>378. When serving papers on Mr. G. Z., the court expressly informed him of his 
</p>
<p>rights in litigation to appoint a lawyer to conduct his defence. Mr. G. Z. indicated that, 
</p>
<p>as he was himself a lawyer, he did not need assign a lawyer to conduct his defence 
</p>
<p>and he did not agree to his family appointing a lawyer for him. For that reason, the 
</p>
<p>lawyers M. S. and D. X., from the M. S. law in Beijing, appointed by his brother G. 
</p>
<p>Z., were unable to act in defence. Under these circumstances, the court decided, in 
</p>
<p>order to ensure that Mr. G. Z.&#8217;s rights in litigation were fully upheld, that it should 
</p>
<p>still appoint two lawyers to defend him, Q. L. from the Tianda law firm in Beijing 
</p>
<p>(which goes by the English &#8220;East Associates&#8221;), and Y. X., from the Chao Yang law 
</p>
<p>firm in Beijing, and Mr G. Z. agreed to this appointment. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>379. In the course of the trial, in addition to conducting his own defence, Mr. G. Z. 
</p>
<p>also received full defence services from his two defence lawyers. The allegations in 
</p>
<p>the letter that we have received that the police harassed Mr. G. Z.&#8217;s family members 
</p>
<p>and others are unfounded. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>380. On<b> 21 December 2006</b>, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal 
</p>
<p>concerning Mr. C. G., a 34 year old blind self- taught human right lawyer in Linyi, 
</p>
<p>Shandong province, and his wife Ms. Y. W., his lawyers Mr. L. J. and Mr. L. F., a 
</p>
<p>member of his defence team, Dr T., and witness to his trial-Mr. C. G.(1), Mr. C. 
</p>
<p>G.(2), Mr. C. G.(3) and Mr. C. G.(4) 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>381. Grave concerns were expressed that the charges against Mr. C. G. and his wife 
</p>
<p>Y. W.  were fabricated and were solely related to their legitimate activities in defence 
</p>
<p>of human rights, in particular their defending villagers&#8217; rights.  Serious concern was 
</p>
<p>expressed that C. G. did not receive a fair trial as his lawyers were obstructed in all 
</p>
<p>aspects of their work from collecting evidence from witnesses to meeting with their 
</p>
<p>client. Concern was also expressed his lawyers were subjected to physical abuse and </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 103 
 
detention to prevent them from representing their client at trial. Similar concerns were 
</p>
<p>expressed for the fate of his wife, Y. W. Further concern was expressed for the 
</p>
<p>physical and psychological integrity of any witnesses for the defence as it was feared 
</p>
<p>that they have been subjected to acts of torture or brutality by the Yinin County PSB.  
</p>
<p>The full details of the allegations submitted have been reflected in the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur&#8217;s previous report on communications sent and received.**** 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>382. By a letter dated <b>2 August 2007</b>, the Government of China indicated that in the 
</p>
<p>evening of 5 February 2006, because he was unhappy with the work of poverty 
</p>
<p>alleviation officials sent to his village, guided by his wife Y. W. and others, he 
</p>
<p>stormed into in the offices of the Dongshigu village committee in Shuanghou 
</p>
<p>Township, Yinan County, and started smashing the glass panes in the doors and 
</p>
<p>windows. Upon returning to C. G.(3)&#8217;s home in his village, he called on C. G.(4), C. 
</p>
<p>G.(2), C. G.(1) and others villagers and urged them to go and smash up police cars in 
</p>
<p>service at the Yinan county police and minibuses belonging to the Shuanghou 
</p>
<p>township local authority. C. G.(4), C. G.(2) and their associate went round the village, 
</p>
<p>shouting and urging people  to go and smash up cars, set on locals officials, chasing 
</p>
<p>them to the municipal offices, and then charged across to the east end of the village, 
</p>
<p>bearing wooden clubs, rocks and other implements, and proceeded to smash the 
</p>
<p>windows in three police cars belonging to the Shuanghou police station, rolled these 
</p>
<p>vehicles over into the roadside ditch, and then set about attacking and beating up 
</p>
<p>police officers on duty at the Yinan county public security bureau. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>383. In the evening of 11 March 2006, C. G.(3), who had been drinking, claimed to 
</p>
<p>have been beaten up in Dongshgu Village and burst into offices of the local village 
</p>
<p>committee, where he started smashing office property. Claiming to be seeking an 
</p>
<p>explanation for C. G.(3)&#8217;s beating, C. G. seized the opportunity to gather together C. 
</p>
<p>G.(3), C. G.(5), Y. W. and others and, at 6p.m that same evening, they charged over to 
</p>
<p>the Yinghou village section of state highway 205, where they proceeded to block the 
</p>
<p>movement of traffic. First C. G. took up a position in the middle of the road and 
</p>
<p>stopped the traffic, then he directed C. G.(5), C. G.(3) and the others to stand and 
</p>
<p>shout in the middle of the road and to block the passage of all vehicles. Police officers 
</p>
<p>                                                 
**** A/HRC/4/34/Add.1. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 104 
</p>
<p>from the public security bureau arrived on the scene to direct the traffic and instructed 
</p>
<p>C. G. to halt what he was doing, namely, urging a crowd of people to block the 
</p>
<p>passage vehicles. C. G. totally ignored their instruction and continued calling on C. 
</p>
<p>G.(5), C. G.(3) and the others to block the traffic. This had the consequence that more 
</p>
<p>than 290 motor vehicles, including ambulances attending to pregnancy and childbirth 
</p>
<p>emergencies, were unable to move and that a section of state highway 205 was 
</p>
<p>blocked for a period of three hours. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>384. On 10 June 2006, C. G. was arrested, in accordance with the law, by the Yinan 
</p>
<p>County public security bureau in Shandong province on suspicion of offences of 
</p>
<p>wilful damage to property and assembling a mob to disrupt the flow of traffic and, on 
</p>
<p>21 June, he was taken into custody with the approval of the procuratorial authorities. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>385. After his case had been referred to the Yinan county people&#8217;s court, C. G.&#8217;s wife 
</p>
<p>assigned as his defence counsel the lawyers L. J., from the Yitong law firm in Beijing, 
</p>
<p>and Z. L., from the Beijing office of the xingyun law firm, also known as the &#8220; 
</p>
<p>Astrorhyme &#8220; law firm, based in Zhejiang province. Before the proceedings opened at 
</p>
<p>first instance, C. G. requested the replacement of his defence lawyers by one X. Z., a 
</p>
<p>lecturer at the State Posts and Telecommunications College. In accordance with the 
</p>
<p>provisions of the Chinese Code of Criminal Procedure, only a lawyer, person 
</p>
<p>recommended by a civic organization or the defendant&#8217;s or suspect&#8217;s work unit and 
</p>
<p>duly nominated by him or her, or the defendant&#8217;s or suspect&#8217;s legal guardian or close 
</p>
<p>relative or friend, may act in his or her defence. X. Z., however, only had his office 
</p>
<p>pass and personal identity document and was unable to produce any official letter of 
</p>
<p>introduction or other credentials; the court had no means of verifying his identity or 
</p>
<p>his relationship to C. G. and for that reason was unable to approve his attorney ship. 
</p>
<p>The court appointed L. J., a lawyer from the Yangdu law firm in Shanong, Z. B., a 
</p>
<p>lawyer from Shandong tonglixing State Law office, as defence counsel for C. G., but 
</p>
<p>C. G. refused their service. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>386. On 19 August 2006, the Yinan county people&#8217;s court, meeting at first instance, 
</p>
<p>found C. G. guilty of the offence of causing wilful damage to property and sentenced 
</p>
<p>him to seven months&#8217; fixed &#8211;term imprisonment; it also found him guilty of the 
</p>
<p>offence of gathering a mob to disrupt the flow of traffic and sentenced him to serve </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 105 
 
four years&#8217; fixed- term imprisonment; the court decided that he should serve 
</p>
<p>combined sentence of four years and three months&#8217; fixed-term imprisonment. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>387. Following his sentencing at first instance, C. G. lodged an appeal. Linyi city 
</p>
<p>people&#8216;s high court in Shandong province, meeting at second instance, found that the 
</p>
<p>court of first instance had restricted C. G.&#8217;s right to defence (the assigned defence 
</p>
<p>counsel had not been accepted by C. G.), a factor which might have adversely 
</p>
<p>influenced the fairness of proceedings, and, on 31 October 2006, it quashed the 
</p>
<p>original judgement and sent the case back to the court of first instance for retrial. The 
</p>
<p>allegations in the letter that we have received that the case was sent back to the 
</p>
<p>original court because there had been insufficient evidence to convict C. G. for the 
</p>
<p>offence of gathering a mob to disrupt the flow of traffic are unfounded. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>388. On 27 November 2006, sitting at a reconstituted bench, the Yinan county 
</p>
<p>people&#8217;s court reopened the case in open proceedings, C. G.&#8216;s brother attended the 
</p>
<p>court in the public gallery, and C. G.&#8216;s defence was conducted by the lawyers L. F. 
</p>
<p>from the Beijing Ruifeng law firm and L. J. from the Beijing Yitong law firm. During 
</p>
<p>the proceedings, Chen&#8217;s rights in litigation were fully upheld: he exercised his own 
</p>
<p>rights to defence and the lawyers appointed by him also made submissions in his 
</p>
<p>defence. On 1 December 2006 the court ruled at first instance and made public its 
</p>
<p>verdict: for the offence of wilful damage to property, it sentenced C. G. to seven 
</p>
<p>months&#8217; fixed &#8211;term imprisonment and, for the offence of gathering a mob to disrupt 
</p>
<p>the flow traffic, it sentenced him to four years&#8217; fixed term imprisonment and, for the 
</p>
<p>offence of gathering a mob to disrupt the flow traffic, it sentenced him to four years&#8217; 
</p>
<p>fixed term imprisonment, ruling that he should serve a combined term of four years 
</p>
<p>and three months. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>389. G. once again lodged an appeal. The Linyi city intermediate people&#8217;s court, 
</p>
<p>after hearing the case at second instance, ruled that Chen, as a means of giving vent to 
</p>
<p>personal grievances, has caused and incited others to cause wilful damage to property, 
</p>
<p>the amount of which was considerable, and that this conduct had infringed public and 
</p>
<p>private ownership rights and constituted the offence of wilful damage to property; it 
</p>
<p>found further that C. G., with the aim of influencing and exerting pressure on the </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 106 
</p>
<p>government, had assembled a mob to block traffic, that he had been responsible for 
</p>
<p>organizing the process of assembling a mob to block traffic, that he had directed the 
</p>
<p>operation  and had served as the ringleader and that his conduct had therefore 
</p>
<p>constituted the offence of assembling a mob for the purpose of disrupting traffic. As 
</p>
<p>the original court judgement had been based on clear facts, the conviction had been 
</p>
<p>correct, the sentence had been commensurate with the offence and the trial 
</p>
<p>proceedings had followed due process, the court dismissed the appeal and ruled that 
</p>
<p>the original judgement should stand. This ruling was published on 12 January 2007. 
</p>
<p>During the proceedings at second instance, the court also heard the views of C. G.&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>defence counsel and, in accordance with applicable evidence, found that the facts set 
</p>
<p>out in the accusation by the procuratorial authorities and the charges brought against 
</p>
<p>the defendant were sound and accordingly handed down the judgement referred 
</p>
<p>above. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>390. In their conduct of the proceedings against C. G., the public security authorities 
</p>
<p>fully upheld his rights in litigation and those of his family members, acted in strict 
</p>
<p>compliance with the law and applied the law in civilized manner. The proceedings in 
</p>
<p>this case were all conducted in accordance with the law, the facts underlying the 
</p>
<p>court&#8217;s  judgement were clear, the evidence was ample and conclusive, the sentence 
</p>
<p>was commensurate with the offence and the trial proceedings followed due process. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>391. With regard to the allegations in the letter to the effect that, on 30 October 2005, 
</p>
<p>C. G.&#8217;s lawyer endeavoured to lay charges with the Yinana county court against 
</p>
<p>public security officials from Shuanghou township for having caused intentional 
</p>
<p>bodily harm to C. G., but that the court ignored this suit, it is the understanding of the 
</p>
<p>Chinese government that the Yinan county court did receive an application from the 
</p>
<p>lawyers to bring charges, but as the lawyers did not have C. G.&#8217;s power of attorney, 
</p>
<p>following an investigation the court determined that the lawyers were not authorized 
</p>
<p>to act for the plaintiff and rejected the application. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>392. With regard to the allegations in the letter to the effect that L. J. and L. F. filed 
</p>
<p>and administrative and civil action with the Linyi city intermediate people&#8217;s court 
</p>
<p>against the Linyi city public security bureau (including bureau chief, L. J.) and other 
</p>
<p>government agencies, it is the government understanding that the court did receive </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 107 
 
such an application from the lawyers, in December 2006, and that the matter is 
</p>
<p>currently being investigated and no conclusion has been reached yet. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>393. The allegations in the letter that public security officials have been harassing 
</p>
<p>members of C. G.&#8217;s family, his lawyer and other persons are entirely without 
</p>
<p>substance.  
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>394. On <b>12 July 2007</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
</p>
<p>and consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a 
</p>
<p>component of the right to an adequate standard of living, the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>the question of torture, and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
</p>
<p>situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the Government 
</p>
<p>regarding Ms. M. H., a well-known petitioner against family planning policies and 
</p>
<p>forced evictions in Shanghai since 1989. Ms. M. H. was the subject of joint appeals 
</p>
<p>sent on 10 May 2007, 1 February 2006 and on 5 January 2006. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteurs noted Government responses received in this regard, including those 
</p>
<p>dated 18 April and 14 June 2006. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>395. According to recent information received, on 15 May 2007 at approximately 
</p>
<p>6. am, Ms. M. H. was transferred from the police detention centre to prison. She was 
</p>
<p>given inadequate clothing which left her virtually naked. When protesting against this 
</p>
<p>treatment, she was beaten by police officers and placed in solitary confinement upon 
</p>
<p>her arrival at the prison. Ms. M. H. embarked upon a hunger strike as a gesture of 
</p>
<p>protest against her situation. She was subsequently subjected to forced feeding on 
</p>
<p>three occasions by prison guards who tied her hands and forced a tube down her 
</p>
<p>throat. She was placed under constant surveillance by inmates that had been assigned 
</p>
<p>the task by prison guards. These prisoners seem to have also been ordered to harass 
</p>
<p>Ms. M. H. and they proceeded to verbally abuse her. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>396. At the time of writing, Ms. M. H. was in poor health, suffering from high blood 
</p>
<p>pressure and arthritis. These conditions are further aggravated by her inadequate </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 108 
</p>
<p>living conditions. She has neither been provided with chairs, nor a bed. As such, she 
</p>
<p>has no choice but to lie on the floor, often in cold and damp conditions. Ms. M. H. 
</p>
<p>was visited by her husband on 28 June 2007. At this time her husband reported her ill-
</p>
<p>treatment and requested that the prison officials grant Ms. M. H.'s lawyers access to 
</p>
<p>visit her in order to prepare for her upcoming appeal.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>397. Serious concern is expressed at reports that Ms. M. H. is being detained in poor 
</p>
<p>conditions which may prove detrimental to her health.  Further concern is expressed 
</p>
<p>that the reported ill-treatment of Ms. Mao M. H. in prison may be directly related to 
</p>
<p>her peaceful work in defence of human rights in China, and may form part of a pattern 
</p>
<p>of harassment of human rights defenders in the country.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>398. By letter dated on <b>15 August 2007</b>, the Chinese Government noted that it has 
</p>
<p>carefully examined the matters referred to in the communications and informed that 
</p>
<p>on 16 April 2007 M. H. was sentenced by the Yangpu district people&#8217;s court to two 
</p>
<p>years and six months&#8217; fixed-term imprisonment for the offence of causing malicious 
</p>
<p>damage to property, to run from 30 May 2006 to 29 November 2008. She is currently 
</p>
<p>serving her sentence in the Shanghai women&#8217;s prison. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>399. Upon being admitted to prison, M. H. underwent a physical examination which 
</p>
<p>showed that, apart from an inclination to high blood pressure, all other indications 
</p>
<p>were within the normal range. M. H. is currently sharing a cell with two other women 
</p>
<p>prisoners, she has not been sent to the punishment cells nor has she been placed in 
</p>
<p>solitary confinement. Her eating and sleeping arrangements are normal. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>400. With regard to the issue of appeal, at the time of writing M. H. had not 
</p>
<p>submitted any written application, nor had she applied to see her lawyer, so there was 
</p>
<p>no proof that the prison refused to allow her lodge an appeal. The prison officers, 
</p>
<p>acting in accordance with the law, treated the prisoners in a civilized manner. M. H. 
</p>
<p>enjoys her rights on the same footing as the other prisoners, including the right to 
</p>
<p>health and the right to appeal. The allegation that M. H. had been subjected to ill-
</p>
<p>treatment was not supported by the facts. </p>

<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>401. On <b>5 November 2007</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
</p>
<p>causes and consequences jointly with the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a 
</p>
<p>component of the right to an adequate standard of living, the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>the question of torture, and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
</p>
<p>situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the Government 
</p>
<p>regarding Ms. M. H., a well-known petitioner against family planning policies and 
</p>
<p>forced evictions in Shanghai since 1989.  Ms. M. H. was the subject of previously 
</p>
<p>transmitted communications. According to information received:  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>402. On 13 September 2007, prison authorities reportedly ordered a fellow inmate to 
</p>
<p>beat Ms. M. H. in punishment for revealing that she had been held in solitary 
</p>
<p>confinement for 70 days in July and August 2007. This was in violation of Article 15 
</p>
<p>of the Chinese Prison Law which stipulates a maximum of 15 days for the solitary 
</p>
<p>confinement of prisoners. Ms. M. H. was badly bruised as a result of the beating. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>403. On 24 September 2007, prison authorities allegedly sent Ms. M. H. to the 
</p>
<p>Nanhui Prison Hospital. She had previously refused to undergo a medical examination 
</p>
<p>for fear that she would be forcibly injected with drugs, as had happened when she was 
</p>
<p>held in a psychiatric institution in the 1980s. At the Nanhui Prison Hospital Ms. M. 
</p>
<p>H.&#8217;s clothes were removed and she was tied to a bed and force-fed by other inmates.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>404. Ms. M. H.&#8217;s husband, Mr. W. X., was prevented from visiting her at the 
</p>

<p><b>Observations

<p> 
</p>
<p>405. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of China for its 
</p>
<p>reply to her communications of 2006 and 2007. Nonetheless, the Rapporteur regrets </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 110 
</p>
<p>that the Government of China did not reply to her communication sent on 
</p>
<p>5 November 2007 and reiterates her interest in receiving responses from the 
</p>
<p>Government in regard to the allegations submitted. She would be particularly 
</p>
<p>interested to know whether this case has resulted in any internal disciplinary measures 
</p>
<p>against police officers involved in the alleged ill treatment of Ms. M.H..  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>406. The Special Rapporteur would also like to recall article 4 (b) of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, which stipulates 
</p>
<p>that States should pursue by all appropriate means and without delay a policy of 
</p>
<p>eliminating violence against women and, to this end, should refrain from engaging in 
</p>
<p>violence against women 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>407. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur would like to bring to the Government&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>attention article 4 (c &amp; d) of the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Violence against Women, which notes the responsibility of States to exercise due 
</p>
<p>diligence to prevent, investigate and, in accordance with national legislation, punish 
</p>
<p>acts of violence against women, whether those acts are perpetrated by the State or by 
</p>
<p>private persons. To this end, States should develop penal, civil, labour and 
</p>
<p>administrative sanctions in domestic legislation to punish and redress the wrongs 
</p>
<p>caused to women who are subjected to violence. Women who are subjected to 
</p>
<p>violence should be provided with access to the mechanisms of justice and, as provided 
</p>
<p>for by national legislation, to just and effective remedies for the harm that they have 
</p>
<p>suffered. States should, moreover, also inform women of their rights in seeking 
</p>
<p>redress through such mechanisms.

<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>410. On <b>7 June 2007</b>, the Government replied to the letter dated 20 April 2007. It 
</p>
<p>informed the Special Rapporteur that investigation conducted by Iloilo City Police 
</p>
<p>Office disclosed that on 12 April 2007 at around 9:30 pm, Mr. J. E. G., secretary 
</p>
<p>general of KARAPATAN- Panay was driving a Mitsubishi L- 200 van with plate no.

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>411. Accordingly, the group was travelling from Antique province to Iloilo City to

       Page 112 
</p>
<p>Cabanban, Oton, Iloilo, they were overtaken and blocked by said Delica van. At that 
</p>
<p>juncture, about three unidentified men wearing fatigue pants and armed with pistols 
</p>
<p>alighted from the vehicle. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>412. One of them shot Mr. J. E. G. at the neck while the other smashed the left side 
</p>
<p>window of one of the L200 van. The men pulled out Mr. J. E. G. from L200 van and 
</p>
<p>left him along the highway then drove said vehicle towards Iloilo City taking with 
</p>
<p>them Ms. M. L. P.-D. and Mr. N. A. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>413. Concerned residents in the area brought Mr. J. E. G. to the hospital for medical 
</p>
<p>treatment. On the following day, the L200 van was found burned at the sugarcane 
</p>
<p>plantation in Barangay Janiuay, Iloilo City. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>414. Verification made with Land Transportation Office (LTO) region 6 revealed 
</p>
<p>that the Delica Van plate no. FVF-463 was registered to a passenger jeepney. The 
</p>
<p>owner of the Delica jeepney denied owning a Delica van and told the police that said 
</p>
<p>plate number was lost long time ago and had reported the same to the LTO. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>415. A petition of Writ of Habeas corpus for Ms. M. L. P.-D. and Mr. N. A. was filed

418. On <b>2 March 2007</b>, Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
</p>
<p>and consequences jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
</p>
<p>Arbitrary Detention, and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, sent an 
</p>
<p>urgent appeal to the Government regarding the arrest and alleged torture of Ms. M. A. 
</p>
<p>(29) by army members in Kananga, Leyte, Eastern Visayas, in the Philippines. Ms. M. 
</p>
<p>A. was reportedly six-months pregnant at the time.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>419. According to information received: On 7 November 2006, around 3:30 p.m., 
</p>
<p>Ms. M. A. disembarked from a bus at Kananga when a group of military officers 
</p>
<p>apprehended her. The men introduced themselves as members of the 19th Infantry 
</p>
<p>Battalion of the Philippine Army, they covered her eyes and took her to the military 
</p>
<p>headquarters at Barangay Aguitinh, Kananga. The army officers alleged that Ms. M. 
</p>
<p>A. was suspected of involvement in the killing of a soldier at the Kananga market 
</p>
<p>earlier that day.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>420. Ms. M. A. was reportedly tortured in order to force her to reveal the 
</p>
<p>whereabouts of her alleged companions from a paramilitary group calling itself the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;New People&#8217;s Army&#8221;. One of the military officers put a plastic bag over her head 
</p>
<p>and tied it around her neck, and two other men, identified as Mr. H. and Mr. T., hit 
</p>
<p>her legs with their weapons. She was hit in the chest by a man called H. and hit in the 
</p>
<p>head and the back by other soldiers. She was kept in military custody for three days 
</p>
<p>and later moved to Kananga Municipal Prison. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>421. On 26 January 2007, Ms. M. A. was transferred to the sub-provincial jail in 
</p>
<p>Ormoc City, where she is currently being detained in a small and crowded cell. 
</p>
<p>Ms. M. A. reportedly almost lost her unborn child as a result of the torture and still 
</p>
<p>feels pain in her chest.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>422. The Special Rapporteurs expressed concern over the health of Ms. M. A. and

</p>
<p>423. On <b>7 June 2007</b>, the Government of Philippine replied to the letter dated 
</p>
<p>2 March 2007 concerning the case of Ms. M. A., based on information provided by 
</p>
<p>the Philippine National Police. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>424. The government stated that according to police report, on 7 November 2006, at 
</p>
<p>around 2:00 PM, SSgt. G. B. A., a member of the 19th Infantry Battalion of the 
</p>
<p>Philippine Army based in Kanaga, Leyte, was shot to death at the public market of 
</p>
<p>Kanaga by two unidentified assailant. The gunmen reportedly left the crime scene in a 
</p>
<p>hurry on motorcycle. SSgt. A. and his two companions Sgt. B. J. E. and Cpl. D. C. J. 
</p>
<p>were buying food supplies at the time SSgt. A. was killed. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>425. Sgt. B. J. E. and Cpl. D. C. J., both unarmed at that time, immediately followed 
</p>
<p>the assailant and arrested at the scene was a woman suspected to be an accomplice, 
</p>
<p>who was later identified  as M. C. A., 20 years old, married and a resident of Sangka, 
</p>
<p>Kanaga , Leyte. Ms M. A. was left behind allegedly to monitor the situation. A cell 
</p>
<p>phone containing text messages implicating her as the lookout and accomplice in the 
</p>
<p>killing of SSgt. A. was confiscated from her. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>426. On 8 November 2006, Ms. M. A. signed a waiver of her rights pursuant to the 
</p>
<p>provisions of art.125 of the revised penal code, duly subscribed and sworn to before 
</p>
<p>the Asst. Prosecutor of the provincial Prosecutor&#8217;s officer in Ormoc City. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>427. In the morning of 09 November 2006, Ms. M. A. was brought for inquest before 
</p>
<p>the Provincial Prosecutor&#8217;s Office in Ormoc City for the crime murder under IS 
</p>
<p>No.2006-120. In the afternoon of the same date, she was turned over to the Kanaga 
</p>
<p>Municipal Police Station where she was temporarily detained while awaiting proper 
</p>
<p>disposition of her case. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>428. On 25 January 2007, she was physically examined at the Ormoc District 
</p>
<p>Hospital, Ormoc City. On the same date she was transferred from her detention to the 
</p>
<p>Leyte Sub provincial Jail, Ormoc City pending hearing of her murder case in court. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>429. It does not appear that Ms. M. A. has instituted any complaint for the alleged 
</p>
<p>human right violations committed against her. However, a case of murder against </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 115 
 
Ms. M. A. was filed before the Provincial Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, Ormoc city under IS 
</p>
<p>No. 2006-120 on 09 November 2006 for her alleged involvement in the killing of 
</p>
<p>SSgt A., pending trial before said Provincial Prosecutor office. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>430. Reference is made to the results of investigation, medical examination and 
</p>
<p>judicial inquiries as provided for in question number 1. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>431. Based on the facts of circumstances, it appears that the warrantless arrest on 
</p>
<p>Ms. M. A. by the military personnel was in accordance with the provisions of section 
</p>
<p>5, Rule 113 of the revised Rules in Criminal Procedures. Evidently, she had signed a 
</p>
<p>valid waiver, thus waived her right pursuant to article 125 of the Revised Penal 
</p>
<p>Code. Hence, there is no arbitrary detention committed against her to speak of under 
</p>
<p>circumstances.

</p>
<p>officer who was in the process of arresting Ms. M. A. I.&#8217;s son in execution of a court

</p>
<p>regarding F.T. and her children N. and S. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

</p>
<p>causes and consequences jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
</p>
<p>torture sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding A.A., a 19-year-old woman 
</p>
<p>from al-Qatif.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>450. According to the information received: Shortly after the woman reportedly met 
</p>
<p>with a male companion, the two were kidnapped at knifepoint by a gang of seven 
</p>
<p>men. The companion was attacked by the gang, but was then released. The woman 
</p>
<p>was allegedly then raped by the gang.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>451. On 1 November 2006, four members of the gang were sentenced to prison terms 
</p>
<p>ranging from one to five years, in addition to sentences of flogging ranging from 80 to 
</p>
<p>1,000 lashes. The legal status of the remaining three defendants is not known as they 
</p>
<p>had reportedly surrendered to the police only shortly before the conclusion of the trial.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>452. A.A. was convicted in the same trial of Khilwa for being alone in private with a 
</p>
<p>man who was not a member of her immediate family, after reportedly meeting with a 
</p>
<p>male companion in 2006. The companion was convicted on the same charge. Both 
</p>
<p>have been sentenced by a court in al-Qatif to 90 lashes and both are at risk of 
</p>
<p>imminent corporal punishment.

<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>453. On <b>16 July 2007</b>, the Government of Saudi Arabia replied to the

</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 120 
</p>
<p>454. The Government stated that the competent authorities in the Kingdom of Saudi 
</p>
<p>Arabia indicated that the case in question was investigated by the security authorities 
</p>
<p>on the basis of a complaint lodged by the woman&#8217;s husband, in his capacity as her 
</p>
<p>legal guardian, in which he claimed that his wife had been the victim of abduction and 
</p>
<p>rape. The sentences handed down against the woman, her companion and those who 
</p>
<p>raped her were based on their commission of offences designated as criminal acts 
</p>
<p>under Saudi Law and substantiated by legally valid evidence and other means of proof 
</p>
<p>consistent with international legal standards. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>455. After the judgment was pronounced, the offenders declared themselves satisfied 
</p>
<p>with the fairness of their sentences. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>456. On <b>22 November 2007</b>, the Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women 
</p>
<p>jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
</p>
<p>religion or belief, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding the same 19-
</p>
<p>year-old Shiite woman from Al-Qatif. According to reports received, in 2006, the 
</p>
<p>Shia woman and a male companion were kidnapped at knifepoint by a gang of seven 
</p>
<p>Sunni men. The male companion was attacked by the gang, and later released. The 
</p>
<p>woman was repeatedly raped by the gang. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>457. Four members of the gang were at the time sentenced by the Qatif General 
</p>
<p>Court to prison terms ranging from one to five years, with floggings of up to 1000 
</p>
<p>lashes. Three other gang members reportedly turned themselves in before the 
</p>
<p>conclusion of the trial.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>458. The victim of the gang rape and her male companion were convicted in 2006 of 
</p>
<p>being alone in private with a member of the opposite sex who was not an immediate 
</p>
<p>family member, under an offence known as Khulwa in sharia law.   
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>459. Following the request of the review of the verdict, on 15 November 2007, a 
</p>
<p>court in eastern Saudi Arabia increased the original sentence against the seven </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 121 
 
members of the gang, and also increased the sentence against the 19-year old woman 
</p>
<p>from 90 lashes to 200 lashes and a six month prison term. In addition, it is reported 
</p>
<p>that the court revoked the professional license of her lawyer and banned him from 
</p>
<p>defending her. 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>460. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Saudi Arabia for 
</p>
<p>its replies to two of her communications. With respect to the communication sent on 
</p>
<p>8 December 2006 and to the Government&#8217;s reply to it on 29 January 2007, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur would be interested to know what exactly the legal basis for such forcible 
</p>
<p>divorce was, and whether further judicial proceedings have resulted or would result in 
</p>
<p>any positive outcome for F.T and M.T. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>461. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur regrets not having received a reply to her 
</p>
<p>communication sent on 22 November 2007 and reiterates her interest in receiving a 
</p>
<p>reply from the Government in regard to all allegations submitted, in particular the 
</p>
<p>reasoning for the sentencing of a victim of rape to corporal punishment and prison 
</p>
<p>term. Such sentence would appear contradictory to the international human rights 
</p>
<p>obligations of the Kingdom, notably the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
</p>
<p>of Discrimination against Women and the Convention against Torture and Other 
</p>
<p>Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>acknowledges that the victim A.A. has been pardoned by the King in December 2007 
</p>
<p>and congratulates the King for his action. She nonetheless recommends that legal and 
</p>
<p>judicial measures be taken to prevent other similar sentences from being handed down 
</p>
<p>against victims of rape.

<p>462. On <b>23 April 2007</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
</p>
<p>causes and consequences has jointly with the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 122 
</p>
<p>persons, especially women and children, Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, 
</p>
<p>child prostitution and child pornography, and Special Rapporteur on the human rights 
</p>
<p>of Migrants, sent an allegation letter to the Government concerning the trafficking in 
</p>
<p>women and children for purposes of sexual exploitation and forced labour, through 
</p>
<p>and from Mozambique to South Africa.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>463. According to the information received: South Africa is reported to be the main 
</p>
<p>destination country for Mozambican victims of trafficking. Mozambique is 
</p>
<p>particularly exposed to trafficking in persons due mainly to porous borders and the 
</p>
<p>absence of protective legislation against trafficking.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>464. From Maputo in Mozambique, women and children are reportedly trafficked via 
</p>
<p>Ressano Garcia or the Lebombo border in Mozambique to Gauteng. Another route 
</p>
<p>used for trafficking of persons to South Africa, specifically to Gauteng and KwaZulu-
</p>
<p>Natal, is the border at Ponta do Ouro. The trafficking continues further either to the 
</p>
<p>south of Swaziland and directly to Johannesburg and Pretoria, or south to Durban and 
</p>
<p>Pietermaritzburg. It is estimated that approximately 1 000 Mozambican women per 
</p>
<p>year are trafficked along these routes. Reportedly, children are also trafficked daily in 
</p>
<p>trucks through the Kruger National Park or the Swaziland border. Mozambicans from 
</p>
<p>the north of Mozambique are trafficked into South Africa via Zimbabwe. It is reported 
</p>
<p>that people being trafficked from the Great Lakes Region and East Africa enter the 
</p>
<p>north of Mozambique via Malawi or Tanzania. Mozambican ports are also said to be a 
</p>
<p>stopping point for traffickers travelling by sea, who then continue the journey 
</p>
<p>overland to South Africa.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>465. It is further reported that small-scale trafficking networks, based at transit 
</p>
<p>houses in the border region between Mozambique, Swaziland and South Africa use 
</p>
<p>minivan taxis to smuggle both migrants and trafficking victims across the border. 
</p>
<p>Accomplices in Johannesburg, Maputo and in the Lebombo region reportedly assist 
</p>
<p>them through recruiting, accommodating and transferring migrants and trafficked 
</p>
<p>persons. Organised Mozambican refugees living legally in South Africa are also 
</p>
<p>reported to be involved in such activities.  
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 123 
</p><p> 
466. In this context, young women attempting to find work in South Africa are 
</p>
<p>allegedly led to believe that they will be offered employment as waitresses or 
</p>
<p>domestic workers. However, upon arrival at the transit centres the women are 
</p>
<p>separated from others, and forced into prostitution or forced labour in agriculture, 
</p>
<p>manufacturing or service industries. When subjected to forced labour, reports indicate 
</p>
<p>that they are often subject to sexual abuse by their employers. Reports also indicate 
</p>
<p>that young women and girls are sold, at the transit houses in Tonga and Johannesburg, 
</p>
<p>as &#8220;wives&#8221; to South African men. There are reports of &#8220;stocks&#8221; of women being 
</p>
<p>displayed and of the possibility to order &#8220;wives&#8221; on demand.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>467. Trafficked children are reportedly sold for 30 to 50 US $ per child. Orphans are 
</p>
<p>particularly vulnerable to trafficking, particularly because of an alleged practice of 
</p>
<p>informal adoption of children and because of adoption laws in Mozambique that are 
</p>
<p>reported to facilitate their trafficking. There is an estimated 1.6 million orphans in 
</p>
<p>Mozambique, of whom 380 000 have lost their parents due to HIV/AIDS.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>468. In addition, the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS in South Africa is reported to 
</p>
<p>play a major role in increasing the demand for the trafficking of younger and 
</p>
<p>presumably uninfected sex workers. Furthermore, it is reported that trafficking 
</p>
<p>through several unguarded borders with Mozambique is facilitated by the complicity 
</p>
<p>or the tolerance of border authorities.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>469. The Government has been undertaking considerable efforts to combat 
</p>
<p>trafficking, including the ratification, on 20 February 2004, of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women 
</p>
<p>and Children. Furthermore, in June 2006, the President signed into law the Children's 
</p>
<p>Act of 2005, which prohibits the trafficking of children, namely &quot;the recruitment, sale, 
</p>
<p>supply, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of children, within or across the 
</p>
<p>borders of the Republic.&quot; However, national legislation explicitly prohibiting 
</p>
<p>trafficking in adults is still to be adopted. The protection of trafficking victims 
</p>
<p>remains also remains inadequate. In December 2005, for example, 940 Mozambican 
</p>
<p>illegal immigrants were deported without first being screened to identify if any 
</p>
<p>amongst them were trafficked persons.  </p>

</p>
<p>convicted Ms. S. I. F. and Ms. A. A. D. on charges of adultery and sentenced them to 
</p>
<p>death by stoning. The two women are currently in detention in Wad Madani women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>prison in Wad Madani, Gazira State. Ms. S. I. F. has one of her children with her in 
</p>
<p>prison. The two women were reportedly convicted under article 146 (a) of the Sudan&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>1991 Penal Code, which states that &#8220;whoever commits the offence of sexual 
</p>
<p>intercourse in the absence of a lawful relationship shall be punished with: a) execution

<p>21 March 2007 and informed the Special Rapporteur of the following: 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>478. On 26 June 2006, a report was filed with the Azazi police in Jazirah State 
</p>
<p>against Ms. S. I. F. Following the completion of inquiries, the report was referred to a 
</p>
<p>court of first instance of Jazirah State, which delivered its verdict on 13 March 2007, 
</p>
<p>in case No. 10/2007, convicting the accused under article 146 (1) (a) of the 1991 </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 126 
</p>
<p>Criminal Code (the penalty for adultery) and based on her confession. The accused is 
</p>
<p>married and engaged in intercourse with others during the husband&#8217;s absence. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>479. Ms. A. A. D. was tried before a court of first instance of Jazirah State, in case 
</p>
<p>No. 24/2007. She was convicted by the court on 6 March 2007 under article 146 (1) 
</p>
<p>(a) of the 1991 Criminal Code (the penalty for adultery) and based on her confession. 
</p>
<p>The accused is married and engaged in intercourse with others during the husband&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>absence. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>480. The two women appealed the verdicts and the Jazirah State Appeal Court issued 
</p>
<p>a ruling overturning the convictions and sentences and returning the case files for a 
</p>
<p>retrial of the two women for a number of reasons, including the fact that they had not 
</p>
<p>had legal assistance during the proceedings. The two women know Arabic very well 
</p>
<p>and so the court did not have to appoint an interpreter, in accordance with article 137 
</p>
<p>of the 1991 Code of Criminal Procedures. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>481. At the time of the response, the case files were before the Jazirah State court of

<p>first instance with a view to the retrial of the two women on instructions from Al-
</p>
<p>Jazirah Appeal Court.

</p>
<p>retrial regarding Ms. S. I. F. and Ms. A. A. D. The Special Rapporteur would also like 
</p>
<p>to stress that the death penalty as applied in this case does not seem to fall within the 
</p>
<p>category of the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; for which international law countenances its 
</p>
<p>possible application. In its general comment No. 6 (2003), the United Nations Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Committee stated that &#8220;the expression &#8216;most serious crimes&#8217; must be read 
</p>
<p>restrictively to mean that the death penalty should be a quite exceptional measure&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>Similarly, this Committee observed that the restriction encapsulated in that phrase 
</p>
<p>cannot be interpreted as permitting the imposition of the death penalty &#8220;for crimes of 
</p>
<p>an economic nature, for corruption and for adultery, or for crimes that do not result in

<p>loss of life&#8221; (CCPR/C/28/Add.15,  paragraph 8). </p>

</p>
<p>causes and consequences, has jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the human rights 
</p>
<p>of migrants and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, sent an urgent 
</p>
<p>appeal to the Government of Sweden regarding Ms. L. K., a Turkish woman of 
</p>
<p>Kurdish origin.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>484. According to information received: in 1988, while still living in Turkey, L. K., 
</p>
<p>then 16, was forced by her parents to enter a marriage with a 31 year-old man. Her 
</p>
<p>husband abused her and their two sons, physically and mentally, almost every day 
</p>
<p>throughout their marriage. Sometimes he would lock her and their two children out of 
</p>
<p>the house and they would be forced to sleep outside. He also repeatedly threatened L. 
</p>
<p>K. that he would hang her and make it look like suicide if she did not obey him. L. K. 
</p>
<p>sought support from her family several times, but was told to return to her husband. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, her mother threatened to marry her again to an even older man if she did 
</p>
<p>not obey.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>485. In 2004, following a relationship with one of her husband&#8217;s friends, which was 
</p>
<p>discovered by her family and discussed in a village meeting, L. K. went into hiding. 
</p>
<p>According to reports, her brothers announced that they would kill her if they found 
</p>
<p>her. Subsequently, she received help in leaving her village and fleeing the country.  L. 
</p>
<p>K. arrived in Sweden on 31 March 2005, where she applied for asylum on 1 April 
</p>
<p>2005, referring to the risk of violence committed in the name of honour. Her asylum 
</p>
<p>application was rejected by the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) on 26 
</p>
<p>August 2006. Following that decision L. K. appealed to the Swedish Alien's Board 
</p>
<p>(Utl&#228;nningsn&#228;mnden), which rejected her application on 29 October 2005. This 
</p>
<p>decision could not be appealed, and the authorities prepared for her deportation. On 
</p>
<p>15 November 2005, temporary legislation came into force, which allowed for a 
</p>
<p>review of rejected asylum applications. L. K.`s application was reviewed in </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 128 
</p>
<p>accordance with the new legislation, but once again rejected. The latter decision could 
</p>
<p>not be appealed.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>486. In March 2006 a new Aliens' Act came into force, according to which asylum 
</p>
<p>applications are tried in first instance by the Swedish Migration Board. This decision 
</p>
<p>of the first instance can be appealed to the Migration Court. If there are exceptional 
</p>
<p>reasons or if there is a need for a legal precedent, this decision can be appealed a 
</p>
<p>second time to the Appellate Migration Court. However, the procedure in the new 
</p>
<p>Aliens' Act does not apply to those asylum-seekers who, like L. K., already had their 
</p>
<p>case tried in full.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>487. L. K., after having exhausted all the remedies in Sweden, was facing the risk of 
</p>
<p>being deported to Turkey.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>488. The Special Rapporteurs were gravely concerned that L. K. may face a serious 
</p>
<p>risk of being killed in the name of &#8220;honour&#8221; if deported back to Turkey and urged the 
</p>
<p>Swedish Government not to deport her.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>489. By letters dated <b>17 January 2007</b> and <b>1 February 2007</b>, the Government 
</p>
<p>requested a letter of attorney signed by Ms. L. K., due to secrecy legislation, in order 
</p>
<p>to provide comprehensive information. While awaiting further examination, her 
</p>
<p>deportation has been temporarily suspended. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>490. On <b>12 June 2007</b>, the Government sent a third letter in which it stated that the 
</p>
<p>facts alleged in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s urgent appeal correspond with the facts that 
</p>
<p>Ms. L. K. had referred to in her application for asylum. However, it claimed that there 
</p>
<p>were strong reasons to question the credibility of this story and this was the main 
</p>
<p>reason for rejecting the application. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>491. Either the Swedish Migration Board or the former Swedish Appeal Board, in 
</p>
<p>their decisions of, respectively 26 August and 29 October 2005, are of the opinion that 
</p>
<p>Ms. L. K. will not be subjected to violence or honour killings in case she returned to </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 129 
 
Turkey. This conclusion was reached through the investigation that has taken place in 
</p>
<p>connection with Ms. L. K.&#8217;s application for asylum. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>492. The Government affirms that the legislation applicable in Ms. L. K.&#8217;s case, 
</p>
<p>which concerns enforcement, is much more restrictive than the one applicable before 
</p>
<p>the decision to refuse the alien entry into Sweden has entered into force. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>493. The Swedish Migration Board decided to reject Ms. L. K.&#8217;s application of 
</p>
<p>impediment to enforcement on the basis of the above-mentioned reasons. The 
</p>
<p>Government advised that Ms. L. K. had the possibility to appeal the decision of the 
</p>
<p>Board to the Migration Court in Sweden, Malm&#246;.  
</p>
<p><b>

<p>494. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Sweden for its

<p>her report to the Human Rights Council on her mission to Turkey&#8225;&#8225;&#8225;&#8225;, which focuses 
</p>
<p>on the continued severe problems of &#8220;honour&#8221;-related violence, including murder and 
</p>
<p>forced suicides, in South-eastern and Eastern Anatolia and highlights serious 
</p>
<p>protection gaps for women at risk of &#8220;honour&#8221;-related violence. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur would appreciate if the Government of Sweden could take due 
</p>

</p>
<p>Government&#8217;s decision and other similar cases.

<p>Government regarding Ms. T. B., a German citizen of Turkish descent. According to 
</p>
<p>information received: 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>496. Ms. T. B. is a German citizen from Hamburg. In April 2006, Ms. T. B. travelled 
</p>
<p>with her mother from Hamburg to the settlement of Karastlak K&#246;y&#252; in the village of 
</p>
<p>Yeni Halfeti, Sanliurfa province, Southeast Turkey, where her grandmother and other 
</p>
<p>relatives reside. Allegedly, her family had pretended that she was going to vacation in 
</p>
<p>the village. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>497. Upon Ms. T. B. arrival in the village, her mother took her passport and identity 
</p>
<p>documents away and told her that she had to enter into an arranged marry with a close 
</p>
<p>relative. According to the latest information received, Ms. T. B. is still in Yeni 
</p>
<p>Halfeti. Reportedly, she faces serious limitation of her freedom of movement and is 
</p>
<p>only on rare occasions able to leave her grandmother&#8217;s house.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>498. Concern was expressed that Ms. T. B. may be forced to marry her relative 
</p>
<p>against her will or face severe violence, if she refuses. We appeal to your 
</p>
<p>Excellency&#8217;s Government to intervene in this case and ensure that the competent 
</p>
<p>Turkish authorities undertake all necessary action to protect Ms. T. B. from forced 
</p>
<p>marriage, any form of violence or the threat thereof. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>499. By letter dated <b>29 June 2006</b>, the Government informed that it was established 
</p>
<p>that Ms. T. B. during her vacation in Turkey, contacted the Provincial Gendarmerie 
</p>
<p>Command in Sanliurfa by phone on 30 May 2006 and requested help from the 
</p>
<p>authorities, stating that there were attempts to force her to get married to her uncle&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>son. The gendarmerie authorities had to refer the matter to the Foreigners Section of 
</p>
<p>the Police, since Ms. T. B. was a German citizen. Ms. T. B. was then assisted by the 
</p>
<p>authorities to return to Germany on 2, June, 2006. On 27 June 2006, the Provincial 
</p>
<p>Gendarmerie Commander in Yeni Halfeti visited Ms. T. B.&#8217;s grandmother&#8217;s premises 
</p>
<p>and confirmed that she was not in Turkey. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>500. According to a relative in Germany whom the Turkish authorities have 
</p>
<p>contacted, Ms. T. B. has been granted protection at a social institution in Germany </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 131 
 
under the German laws and she will be hosted in this institution until October 2006 
</p>
<p>when she will complete the age of 18. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>501. In this framework, it has been confirmed that a forced marriage has not taken 
</p>
<p>place during her stay in Turkey. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>502. On <b>4 June 2007</b>, the Government of Turkey sent a second reply to the same 
</p>
<p>letter dated <b>23 June 2006</b> concerning information requested in relation to any 
</p>
<p>criminal action taken against any alleged perpetrators in the case of Ms. T. B., a 
</p>
<p>German citizen of Turkish descent, who travelled with her mother from Hamburg to 
</p>
<p>karastlak village of Yeni Halfeti, province of Sanhurfa, where her family attempted to 
</p>
<p>force her into an arranged marriage with a close relative. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>503. The Government&#8217;s responded that in its letter of 29 June 2006 it stated that T. B. 
</p>
<p>was assisted by the Turkish authorities to return to Germany on 2 June 2006; that she 
</p>
<p>was assisted from the Provincial Gendarmerie Command in Sanhurfa and that a 
</p>
<p>forced marriage did not take place during her stay in Turkey. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>504. According to follow- up information received from the relevant authorities in 
</p>
<p>Turkey, no complaint has been lodged with the office of the Chief Public Prosecutor 
</p>
<p>of Sanhurfa concerning this incident. The Provincial Gendarmerie Command in 
</p>
<p>Sanhura did not initiate any criminal investigation since T. B. reported to the 
</p>
<p>gendarmerie officials that she had no complains others than  her request for return to 
</p>
<p>Germany. Indeed, the purpose of her application to the Gendarmerie Command was 
</p>
<p>related to her identity card and German passport, which she initially claimed as lost. 
</p>
<p>The Gendarmerie official, who investigated circumstances surrounding the case, 
</p>
<p>concluded that she could not have been deprived of liberty through use of force since 
</p>
<p>she was staying with her 80 year-old grandmother and made her application to the 
</p>
<p>Gendarmerie Command in person. Therefore, the Gendarmerie authorities did not 
</p>
<p>initiate any legal proceedings and referred the matter to the passport and Foreigners 
</p>
<p>Branch of Provincial Directorate for Security, who assisted her to safely return to 
</p>
<p>Germany.

<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>505. On <b>14 September 2007</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
</p>
<p>causes and consequences sent an urgent appeal concerning Ms. C. M., born in 1981 in 
</p>
<p>Marivan (Iran). 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>506. According to information received, Ms. C. M. is the daughter of an Iranian 
</p>
<p>refugee Mr. A. M. (born in 1947 also in Marivan, father&#8217;s Name: A.) who was 
</p>
<p>recognized as a refugee in Turkey under the mandate of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and resettled to Canada in 2006. When Ms. C. 
</p>
<p>M. first arrived in Turkey in 2001, she was registered as a dependent to her father&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>case. During their stay in Turkey, Ms. C. M. met Mr. I. Y. who was among the group 
</p>
<p>of Iranian refugees that came from Iraq (IXIs) and the couple married in Turkey in 
</p>
<p>2003. After their marriage, Ms. C. M. was added as a dependant to her husband&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>case. Mr. I. Y. decided to leave Turkey by irregular means in September 2006 and 
</p>
<p>managed to arrive safely in Netherlands. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>507. Ms. C. M. tried to leave by the same means as her husband but she was arrested 
</p>
<p>at Istanbul Airport on 14 February 2007 by the Turkish authorities and detained for a 
</p>
<p>short period. Upon her release she was allowed to stay legally in Konya with a 
</p>
<p>temporary residence permit. Ms. C. M. remains in Turkey without family support as 
</p>
<p>her husband is now residing in Netherlands and her parents are in Canada. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>508. As Ms. C. M.&#8217;s family is in Canada, she could be sponsored for a family 
</p>
<p>reunification visa and was interviewed by the Canadian Embassy on 13 March 2007. 
</p>
<p>The Canadian Immigration authorities informed that her immigration application was 
</p>
<p>approved. She was issued a visa to join her family in Canada and scheduled to depart 
</p>
<p>on 25 July 2007. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>509. However, the Turkish authorities have reportedly refused to grant her exit 
</p>
<p>permission on the basis that they had classified her as IXI due to her marriage with Mr. 
</p>
<p>I. Y., even though she came directly to Turkey from Iran and has never been in Iraq. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, since she was not a minor, she did not meet the criteria established by the </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 133 
 
</p>
<p>Turkish Government to authorize the resettlement on family re-unification grounds for 
</p>
<p>the group of Iranian refugees who came from Iraq.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>510. Ms. C. M. has been re-scheduled for a flight on 18 September 2007. UNHCR 
</p>
<p>has requested exit permission for her, but has not yet received a reply from the 
</p>
<p>Turkish Government. The lack of prospects of a durable solution in Turkey as well as 
</p>
<p>the refusal by the Turkish authorities to authorize her departure puts Ms. C. M. in a 
</p>
<p>vulnerable situation in Turkey. As an Iranian Kurdish refugee without family support, 
</p>
<p>she may face an increased risk of violence or exploitation, if she cannot reunite with 
</p>
<p>her family. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>511. <b>On 14 November 2007, </b>the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
</p>
<p>causes and consequences sent an allegation letter concerning<b> </b>the intervention by third 
</p>
<p>parties in lawsuits regarding the death of women as a result of suicides that took place 
</p>
<p>under suspicious circumstances or as a result of honour related killings. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>512. The Special Rapporteur commended the Government for the extensive changes 
</p>
<p>that were made recently to the Turkish Civil Code and the Turkish Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>These changes are positive steps towards the elimination of discrimination against 
</p>
<p>women. Nonetheless, she drew the Government&#8217;s attention to the specific provision in 
</p>
<p>the Code of Procedure of the Criminal Code that seems to prevent third parties from 
</p>
<p>intervening in cases of honour related crimes and alleged suicides on behalf of the 
</p>
<p>dead victim.   
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>513. According to information received, opportunities for intervention in lawsuits 
</p>
<p>regarding the death of women as a result of alleged suicides or honour related murders 
</p>
<p>are quite limited. The limitation is elaborated upon in clause 237 of article 5271 of the 
</p>
<p>Code of the Procedure of the Criminal Code, which provides as follows:  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>&#8220;(1) The victim, individuals and legal entities who or which have 
</p>
<p>suffered damage as a result of the offence and parties who are </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 134 
</p>
<p>financially liable may intervene in a criminal action by lodging 
</p>
<p>complaints at every stage of the public prosecution before the court of 
</p>
<p>first instance, until the judgment is rendered. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(2) No requests to intervene in the prosecution may be lodged during 
</p>
<p>the proceedings of appeal. However, requests for intervention which 
</p>
<p>are submitted to the court of first instance and rejected or which cannot 
</p>
<p>be decided upon, shall be examined and decided upon if it is expressly 
</p>
<p>stated in the application for appeal.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>514. In practice, it seems that first degree relatives (i.e. mother, father, husband and 
</p>
<p>children) qualify under paragraph 1 as &#8216;injured parties&#8217;. In order to be recognized as 
</p>
<p>legal party, close relatives of the victim have to give representation rights to a lawyer 
</p>
<p>or the victim has to be personally present at the trial to demand the punishment of the 
</p>
<p>perpetrators of the act of violence. Apparently, victims&#8217; relatives are often reluctant or 
</p>
<p>unwilling to defend the rights of women who committed suicide or were killed, since 
</p>
<p>the perpetuators are generally kinsmen. As a result no lawyer may be appointed to 
</p>
<p>defend the rights of the victim. Lawyers or non-governmental organizations wishing 
</p>
<p>to vindicate the rights of the victim are thus not allowed to participate in such 
</p>
<p>lawsuits.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>515. Although the Turkish legal system envisages that the public prosecutor 
</p>
<p>represent both the suspect&#8217;s and the victim&#8217;s rights, reportedly in many cases the 
</p>
<p>rights of women killed or injured are not adequately defended as no lawyers, women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>organizations or other non-governmental organizations are allowed to intervene in 
</p>
<p>court on behalf of the victims. Allegedly, this situation gives rise to deficient and 
</p>
<p>partial investigations and judgments that do not take into account key elements behind 
</p>
<p>the crimes. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>516. The following specific cases were brought to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention: 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A. A., a mother of five, had repeatedly applied to the Diyarbakir Baglar 
</p>
<p>Police Department and other judicial offices to seek protection from her husband who 
</p>
<p>used drugs and beat her. In January 2007 she was killed by her husband, leaving five </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 135 
 
children behind. Women&#8217;s organizations were not allowed to intervene in her case and 
</p>
<p>were unable to raise issues that seemed to have been overlooked by the police and 
</p>
<p>judicial bodies.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; G. T. was shot by her brothers in Istanbul in February 2004 and then taken 
</p>
<p>to a State hospital where she was killed by her brothers in her hospital bed. The 
</p>
<p>Women&#8217;s Rights Commission of the Istanbul Bar Association requested the 
</p>
<p>authorization to represent G. T. in the trial but its demand was rejected by the Court. 
</p>
<p>The Women&#8217;s Rights Commission wanted to raise in particular the issue of deficient 
</p>
<p>security measures at the hospital, which facilitated the killing. In this respect, I sent an 
</p>
<p>allegation letter to your Government dated 28 April 2004.&#167;&#167;&#167;&#167; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>517. In both cases, the courts allegedly rejected the request by organizations to 
</p>
<p>intervene in the lawsuits based on clause 237 of article 5271 of the Code of Procedure 
</p>
<p>of the Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>518. Finally, according to information received, the Turkish National Assembly 
</p>
<p>discussed amending clause 237 in period 22 of the 110th session during the 4th 
</p>
<p>legislation year on 1 June 2006, as published in issue 122 of the National Assembly&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Official Report. No amendment has been adopted yet. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>519. Concerns are expressed that the provision of clause 237 and the resulting 
</p>
<p>limitation of intervention by third parties who would wish to take part in judicial 
</p>
<p>proceedings to defend the rights of women who allegedly committed suicides or were 
</p>
<p>victims of honour-related crimes affects women disproportionately and prevent their 
</p>
<p>equal treatment before the law. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>520. On <b>18 December 2007</b>, the Government of the Turkey replied to the letter sent 
</p>
<p>on 14 November 2007, with information on the general application of Article 237 of 
</p>
<p>the Criminal Procedure Code. It stated that the parties who have the rights to 
</p>
<p>                                                 
&#167;&#167;&#167;&#167; E/CN.4/2005/72/Add.1.<b> </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 136 
</p>
<p>intervene in criminal cases are listed exhaustively in the Criminal Procedure Code. 
</p>
<p>The intervention of &#8220;victims, individuals and legal entities that have sustained 
</p>
<p>damages as a result of an offence and those who are financially liable&#8221; is crucial in 
</p>
<p>terms of revealing the truth in the criminal proceedings and to ensure a just judgment 
</p>
<p>that provides them with immaterial satisfaction. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>521. Article 237 of the Criminal Procedure Code lays down two conditions for 
</p>
<p>intervention in criminal proceedings. The first condition is the connection with the 
</p>
<p>offence in terms of violation of an interest. For this reason, the list of interveners has 
</p>
<p>been listed exhaustively as such. The Court of Cassation, in many of its decisions, 
</p>
<p>interpreted the parties that suffered damages as &#8220;those whose interest have been 
</p>
<p>directly violated by the offence&#8221; or &#8220;those against whom the material or immaterial 
</p>
<p>elements of the offence are directed&#8221;. The second condition concerns the time limit. 
</p>
<p>The persons and legal entities that have the right to intervene under article 237, should 
</p>
<p>either orally or in written, inform the Court of their intention to intervene in the case 
</p>
<p>during the course of the prosecution until a judgement is rendered.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>522. In view of the above, women&#8217;s organizations or other non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations have the right to intervene in cases where they suffer damages as direct 
</p>
<p>result of an offence, within the prescribed time limit. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>523. The views and observations of the Special Rapporteur have been conveyed to 
</p>
<p>the General Directorate for the Status of Women to be given due consideration in the 
</p>
<p>preparatory work currently undertaken to develop a National Action Plan on the 
</p>
<p>elimination of violence against women. 
</p>

<p>her communications. With respect to her communication dated 14 November 2007, 
</p>
<p>she is encouraged by the Government&#8217;s note that her observations will be given due 
</p>
<p>consideration during the development of a National Action Plan on the elimination of 
</p>
<p>violence against women. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur would submit that the 
</p>
<p>issue at hand requires a legislative amendment as already discussed at the Turkish </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 137 
 
National Assembly on 1 June 2006. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur expresses 
</p>
<p>concern that the exhaustive list of interveners may not grant third parties full access to 
</p>
<p>such criminal proceedings, as their interest might not be considered as &#8220;directly 
</p>
<p>violated&#8221;. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur would like to stress the importance of 
</p>
<p>the participation of non-governmental third parties in judicial proceedings to defend 
</p>
<p>the rights of women who have committed suicides or were victims of human rights 
</p>
<p>violations. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>525. Furthermore, the Rapporteur regrets not having received a reply to her 
</p>
<p>communication sent on 14 September 2007 and reiterates her interest in receiving a 
</p>
<p>reply from the Government of Turkey in regard to all allegations submitted.<b>

<p><b>Response to a communication sent in 2006

<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>526. On <b>18 October 2006, </b>the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
</p>
<p>causes and consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, 
</p>
<p>child prostitution and child pornography, sent an allegation letter concerning the 
</p>
<p>criminal charges against S. M.. Concerns are expressed that these charges and the 
</p>
<p>possible closure of the shelter may be in retaliation for her activities in defence of 
</p>
<p>women's rights since the shelter&#8217;s work is reportedly viewed as a threat to the 
</p>
<p>traditional culture and family values of the country and its continued operation largely 
</p>
<p>depends on S. M.'s work.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>527. By letter dated <b>23 April 2007</b>, the Government responded to the letter of 
</p>
<p>allegation and enclosed the report of the Public Prosecution of Dubai. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>528. On 7 August 2006, the victim notified the police that she had been assaulted by 
</p>
<p>the accused, who had pushed her and pulled her by the hand, at the Hope Centre for 
</p>
<p>the Welfare of the Needy. On 23 August 2006, the Public Prosecutions Office began 
</p>
<p>an investigation into the case and took testimony from the victim and witnesses for 
</p>
<p>the prosecution and the defense. On 14 September 2006, the Public Prosecutions </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1

</p>
<p>Office referred the accused, and the case to the criminal court, on a charge of physical 
</p>
<p>assault of the victim, K. A. Abd al-K. K. On 13 December 2006, the court issued a 
</p>
<p>verdict, in the presence of the parties, acquitting S. G. O. due to lack of evidence. The 
</p>
<p>penalty prescribed by law for the offence is imprisonment and a fine, not closure of

<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>530. On <b>22 February 2007</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
</p>
<p>causes and consequences sent an allegation letter to the Government concerning Ms. 
</p>
<p>S. A., a 15-year-old Afghan girl.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>531. According to information received: S. A. applied for asylum in the United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom on 9 November 2006. She was born in Samangan province (Afghanistan) 
</p>
<p>and is a Sunni Muslim. She attended school in Samangan province from 1996 to 2001. 
</p>
<p>She relocated with her family to Peshawar (Pakistan), but returned to Afghanistan in 
</p>
<p>August 2006. She spent about 8 to 10 days in Kabul and then returned to the 
</p>
<p>Samangan province. Upon return, her family realized that their house had been 
</p>
<p>destroyed and their property there had been confiscated. S. A. stayed with a neighbour. 
</p>
<p>A few weeks later, her father, who was a former soldier and had supported the 
</p>
<p>Taliban, went to the authorities to enquire on the confiscated property. He was 
</p>
<p>arrested. S. A.&#8217;s mother enquired about his whereabouts with the local authorities but 
</p>
<p>received no reply. Two days later she approached the international forces and was told 
</p>
<p>that they could do nothing about it as it was an internal matter.  
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 139 
</p><p> 
532. S. A. and her mother were told by a prison guard that the father was held in a 
</p>
<p>private prison and would only be released if S. A. agreed to marry the warlord A. K., 
</p>
<p>a commander in the Junbish forces of General Abdur Rashid Dostum. S. A.'s father 
</p>
<p>refused. A few days later, a delegation of women approached S. A.'s mother with the 
</p>
<p>same request. S. A. told her mother that she would commit suicide if she was forced 
</p>
<p>to marry A. K. and her mother asked for more time to consider the issue. Two days 
</p>
<p>later, the women came back. They reportedly became aggressive when told that the S. 
</p>
<p>A.'s mother would not agree and told S. A.'s mother that she would lose both her 
</p>
<p>husband and her daughter.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>533. The next day S. A. found out that her father had been killed. S. A.'s mother 
</p>
<p>made immediate arrangements for the family to leave Samangan. S. A., her mother 
</p>
<p>and brother left on 20 October 2006 for Peshawar, where they stayed for two weeks. S. 
</p>
<p>A. travelled to the United Kingdom on 7 November 2006, arrived at Heathrow airport 
</p>
<p>in London on 8 November 2006, and applied for asylum on 9 November 2006. S. A. 
</p>
<p>has no family left in Afghanistan. Her mother is assumed to live in Pakistan.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>534. On 4 January 2007, S. A. was refused asylum and humanitarian protection by 
</p>
<p>the Home Office. She was granted discretionary leave to remain in the United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom given that she was a unaccompanied child and the Home Office was not 
</p>
<p>satisfied that adequate reception arrangement were available in her country of origin. 
</p>
<p>When coming of age, however, S. A. may face removal to Afghanistan.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>535. In the written explanation accompanying the decision, the Home Office stated 
</p>
<p>inter alia that there is sufficient redress from the Afghan authorities with regard to the 
</p>
<p>threat to S. A.'s life if she did not marry the warlord, A. K.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>536. The Home Office further expressed the view that S. A. could move to Kabul 
</p>
<p>where she had stayed for ten days upon return from Pakistan in August 2006 and 
</p>
<p>where sufficient protection was said to be available both by the police authorities and 
</p>
<p>the International Stabilization Assistance Force (ISAF). It was also stated that she 
</p>
<p>would not be known in Kabul for A. K. wanting to marry her or in connection to her 
</p>
<p>family.  </p>

<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>537. On <b>27 March 2007</b>, the Government of the United Kingdom replied to the letter 
</p>
<p>sent on 22 February 2007, concerning Ms S. A. who has appealed against the decision 
</p>
<p>to refuse her asylum in United Kingdom. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>538. Trough the Immigration and Nationality directorate, the government confirmed 
</p>
<p>that every asylum and human right claim is considered on its individual merit in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the obligations of the State under the 1951 Convention relating the 
</p>
<p>Status of Refugees and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) against 
</p>
<p>the background of the latest available country information. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>539. The home Office Country of Origin Information (COI) Service closely monitors 
</p>
<p>the human rights situation in all countries that generate asylum seekers to the United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom, including Afghanistan. It provides accurate, objective, sourced and up to 
</p>
<p>date information on asylum seekers&#8217; countries of origin, for use by IND officials 
</p>
<p>involved in the asylum determination process. In dealing with applications from 
</p>
<p>female asylum seekers from Afghanistan, case workers have access to detailed 
</p>
<p>Country of Origin Information Reports which are updated on rolling basis with 
</p>
<p>information collected through out the year. Where material changes in country 
</p>
<p>conditions occur these will be communicated to case workers as required. These 
</p>
<p>reports focus on the main issues raised in asylum and human rights application to the 
</p>
<p>UK. They are compiled from a wide range of reliable external information sources 
</p>
<p>including international organisations such as UNHCR, and non &#8211; governmental 
</p>
<p>organisations, such as Human Right Watch and Amnesty International, and the media. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>540. The recently published October 2006 COI Report on Afghanistan which 
</p>
<p>contains specific sections on women can be found on the Home Office website at:

</p>
<p>541. In addition, decision-makers have access to the Afghanistan Operational 
</p>
<p>Guidance note (OGN) which provides information and guidance on the main 
</p>
<p>categories of Afghan asylum claims and can be accessed via IND website.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 141 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>542. The Government stated that it was aware that the situation for women may be 
</p>
<p>difficult in Afghanistan and that granting asylum in individual cases may be 
</p>
<p>appropriate. In order to maintain the integrity of the United Kingdom asylum system 
</p>
<p>and prevent unfounded applications, it was important that the Government was able to 
</p>
<p>enforce the return of those who are found not to be in need of protection and who 
</p>
<p>have no rights to remain in the United Kingdom. The Government assured the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur that it will only enforce the return of those Afghan women it is satisfied 
</p>
<p>are not in need of protection, and that it would not seek to enforce returns to 
</p>
<p>Afghanistan unless it were satisfied it is safe to do so. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>543. Having reviewed Ms S. A.&#8217;s case it was decided that, in light of her particular 
</p>
<p>circumstances, a grant for leave in the United Kingdom would be appropriate. At the 
</p>
<p>time of writing Ms. S. A.&#8217;s file was with the Government&#8217;s Appeals Implementation 
</p>
<p>Unit for preparation of status papers which will be forwarded to Ms. S. A. in due 
</p>
<p>course. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>544. On <b>28 September 2007</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women its 
</p>
<p>causes and consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
</p>
<p>torture sent an urgent appeal concerning Ms. S. M., aged 24, a Sri Lankan national of 
</p>
<p>Tamil ethnicity. According to the allegations received: 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>545. At the time the letter was sent, she was detained at Yarl&#8217;s Wood Detention 
</p>
<p>Centre near Bedford, and was at risk of removal to Sri Lanka on Monday, 1 October 
</p>
<p>2007.   
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>546. Between April 2000 and April 2007, she was tortured by the security forces for 
</p>
<p>her alleged support for the LTTE. She suffered beatings, sexual assault and was 
</p>
<p>threatened with death. Within the same period, she was also forced into providing 
</p>
<p>assistance to LTTE activities, such as working in a LTTE-run hospital and collecting 
</p>
<p>food. She fled Sri Lanka for the United Kingdom on 22 April 2007. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 142 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>547. Concern has been expressed that Ms. S. M. may be at risk of torture or ill-
</p>
<p>treatment at the hands of the Sri Lankan security forces upon return. She may further 
</p>
<p>be at risk of being abducted and extra-judicially killed by the LTTE for refusing to 
</p>
<p>continue supporting them. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Observations  
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>548. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government for its reply to her 
</p>
<p>communication of 22 February 2007, particularly for the information that Ms. S.A., 
</p>
<p>given her circumstances, was granted leave in the United Kingdom. The Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>reiterates her interest in receiving a reply in regard to the communication of 28 
</p>
<p>September 2007, particularly given the risks Ms. S. M. may face if removed to Sri 
</p>
<p>Lanka.

</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Response to a communication sent in 2006 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>549. On <b>26 Mach 2007</b>, the Government of the United States of America replied to a 
</p>
<p>letter sent by the Special Rapporteur on <b>19 July 2006</b> regarding the case of J. L. G. 
</p>
<p>The Government replied that in light of the circumstances it was understandable that 
</p>
<p>Ms. J. L. G. felt more should have been done to prevent this crime. However, this 
</p>
<p>matter should be evaluated based on evidentiary record. The facts as presented in the 
</p>
<p>letter sent by the Special Rapporteur were not wholly accurate. In particular, the 
</p>
<p>restraining order against Mr G. granted him a &#8220;mid week dinner visit&#8221; to be arranged 
</p>
<p>by the parties&#8221;. Transcripts of conversations and police reports indicate that Ms. J. L. 
</p>
<p>G. has agreed a visit between Mr. G. and their three daughters that evening; the Castle 
</p>
<p>Rock Police Department was responsive to the information and numerous requests for 
</p>
<p>assistance from Ms. J. L. G. throughout the course of the evening; and that the 
</p>
<p>information available at the time revealed no indication that Ms. J. L. G. was likely to 
</p>
<p>commit this crime against his children. Accordingly, since Ms. J. L. G. consented to 
</p>
<p>the mid- week dinner visit, Mr. G. did not violate the restraining order by taking  his </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 143 
 
daughters out for the evening, a fact Ms. J. L. G. later acknowledged explicitly to the 
</p>
<p>police department. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>550. The Government also stated that the fact that Ms. J. L. did not prevail in her 
</p>
<p>federal court case does not mean that the United States authorities failed to properly 
</p>
<p>investigate her claim or that she was denied access to proper remedies in the United 
</p>
<p>States court system. The judicial remedies available in the United States to victims of 
</p>
<p>domestic violence were extensive. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>551. The Government claims that the Unites States&#8217; conduct in this case was fully 
</p>
<p>consistent with the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Violence against Women and with United States obligations under the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The facts demonstrate that there was no 
</p>
<p>human rights violation. There was no failure to exercise due diligence; nor was there a 
</p>
<p>failure to provide access to the mechanisms of justice and to just and effective 
</p>
<p>remedies. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>552. The Government declared to be among the world&#8217;s strongest protectors of 
</p>
<p>victims of domestic abuse. It regrets that even the strongest of laws cannot prevent 
</p>
<p>every tragedy. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>553. The Government also attached the extremely detailed &#8220;Response of the 
</p>
<p>Government of the United States of America to the Inter- American Commission on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights regarding J. L. G., Petition No. P-1490-05&#8221;, which can be summarized 
</p>
<p>as follow: 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>554. The State alleges that the events which occurred prior to the murders of Ms. J. 
</p>
<p>L. G.&#8217;s three daughters, on 23 June 1999, confirm that she had agreed that Mr. G. 
</p>
<p>could see their three daughters that evening for a mid-week dinner visit and that the 
</p>
<p>visit was consistent with the restraining order.  Therefore, the State alleges that the 
</p>
<p>information available at the time revealed no indication that Mr. G. was likely to 
</p>
<p>commit that tragic crime against his own daughters. 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 144 
</p>
<p>555. The State alleges that the evidentiary records show that throughout the evening 
</p>
<p>of June 22, 1999, and the early hours of June 23, 1999, the police responded 
</p>
<p>professionally to the information Ms. J. L. G. provided.  The State argues that 
</p>
<p>although the restraining order granted Mr. G. &#8220;temporary sole physical custody&#8221; of 
</p>
<p>the children, it granted Mr. G. &#8220;parenting time with the minor children on alternating 
</p>
<p>weekends commencing after work on Friday evening and continuing through 7:00 
</p>
<p>p.m. Sunday evening&#8221;.  It also granted Mr. G. a &#8220;mid-week dinner visit&#8221; to be 
</p>
<p>&#8220;arranged by the parties.&#8221; Therefore, the State argues that since Ms. J. L. G. consented 
</p>
<p>to the mid-week dinner visit, Mr. G. did not violate the restraining order by taking his 
</p>
<p>daughters for the evening. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>556. The State argues that members of the Castle Rock Police Department were 
</p>
<p>responsive to her numerous requests for assistance and took her concerns 
</p>
<p>seriously.  In response to her initial call, allegedly two officers were dispatched to Ms. 
</p>
<p>G.&#8217;s house, one went directly to her house and the other one went to Mr. Gonzales&#8217; 
</p>
<p>house, and later joined the first officer at Ms. G.&#8217;s house.  The State also alleges that 
</p>
<p>at no point did Ms. J. L. G. show the officers a restraining order. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>557. At approximately 8:43 p.m., Ms. J. L. G. called the police and informed the 
</p>
<p>dispatcher that she had received a telephone call from her husband and that he was 
</p>
<p>with the children at Elitch&#8217;s amusement park in Denver.  In that occasion, the State 
</p>
<p>alleges that Ms. J. L. G. did not mention any conversation with Rosemary Young (Mr. 
</p>
<p>Gonzales&#8217; girlfriend) nor did she mention any concern about Mr. G. mental state or 
</p>
<p>the safety of her children, nor did she request that an officer should be dispatched to 
</p>
<p>locate Mr. G. at the amusement park. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>558. At 9:57 p.m., the State alleges that Ms. J. L. G. called again and expressed 
</p>
<p>frustration that her daughters had not arrived home.  She did not mention that she was 
</p>
<p>concerned about the safety of any of the children.  Nor did she request that the Castle 
</p>
<p>Rock police put out an &#8220;APB&#8221; (all points bulletin to other police 
</p>
<p>departments).  According to the State, Ms. J. L. G. implicitly acknowledged that there 
</p>
<p>was no restraining order violation when she explained to the police dispatcher in her 
</p>
<p>first call to the Castle Rock police and in her subsequent conversations with an officer 
</p>
<p>that she had agreed to the visit. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 145 
 
 
</p>
<p>559. At approximately 12.30 am, on Wednesday, 22 June, Ms. J. L. G. showed up at 
</p>
<p>the police department in tears.  The State alleges that at this point she expressed 
</p>
<p>concern about Mr. G.&#8217;s mental state saying that he had &#8220;lost it&#8221; and that he might be 
</p>
<p>&#8220;suicidal&#8221;. The State claims that the police ordered to locate Mr. G. and his vehicle 
</p>
<p>through an &#8220;Attempt to Locate BOLO&#8221; (an acronym for &#8220;Be On The Look Out&#8221; 
</p>
<p>which is directed to other jurisdictions so that they may notify the requesting police 
</p>
<p>department if they locate the individual in question).  According to the investigation, 
</p>
<p>the State informs that Mr. G. reached the police station at 3.25 am and fired shots 
</p>
<p>through the window.  After an exchange of gunfire with the officers, Mr. G. died. 
</p>
<p>When the officers approached Mr. G.&#8217;s truck, they discovered the bodies of the three 
</p>
<p>young girls. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>560. The State argues that the petition is inadmissible for failure to state a breach of a 
</p>
<p>duty by the United States under the American Declaration.  The State alleges that no 
</p>
<p>provision of the Declaration imposes an affirmative duty on States to actually prevent 
</p>
<p>the commission of the crimes perpetrated by Mr. G.  Furthermore, the State also 
</p>
<p>alleges that no other provision of the Declaration contains language that even 
</p>
<p>addresses implementation of the enumerated rights as the American Convention.  The 
</p>
<p>American Convention, on the other hand, includes a provision that describes the 
</p>
<p>actual obligations of State Parties regarding implementation of the rights enumerated 
</p>
<p>in the Convention. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>561. Furthermore, the State alleges that Ms. J. L. G. did not exhaust all available 
</p>
<p>remedies to report the events suffered.  Particularly, the State alleges that the actual 
</p>
<p>facts of the case were not addressed in the domestic litigation.  At the district court 
</p>
<p>level, the Town of Castle Rock filed a motion to dismiss the claim.  The District Court 
</p>
<p>found that as a matter of law, Ms. J. L. G. had failed to state a claim upon which relief 
</p>
<p>could be granted. Accordingly, the actual facts were not addressed in the litigation 
</p>
<p>because the appeals process dealt with whether the federal law invoked by Ms. J. L. 
</p>
<p>G., was available based on the allegations set forth in her complaint.  The State claims 
</p>
<p>that had Mr. G. survived an additional range of remedies such as criminal prosecution 
</p>
<p>and criminal or civil contempt proceedings would have been available to Ms. J. L. </p>

<p>G..  The Supreme Court determined that the Fourteenth Amendment&#8217;s Due Process 
</p>
<p>Clause, granted police officers discretion in enforcing restraining orders, and 
</p>
<p>determined that Ms. J. L. G. did not have federal entitlement to enforcement of the 
</p>
<p>restraining order. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>562. The State alleges that Ms. J. L. G. never filed a complaint with the Castle Rock 
</p>
<p>Police Department or with the Town of Castle Rock which would have prompted an 
</p>
<p>investigation of her complaint by the Castle Rock Police Department or the Town of 
</p>
<p>Castle Rock.  In addition, although Ms. J. L. G. chose not to pursue a claim under 
</p>
<p>Colorado law, such as a civil suit in state court against the police officers under state 
</p>
<p>tort law, the State alleges that &#8220;had she been able to establish that the Castle Rock 
</p>
<p>police officers acted &#8220;willfully and wantonly&#8221; outside the scope of their employment, 
</p>
<p>she should have filed a civil suit against them in state court.&#8221; Furthermore, the State 
</p>
<p>argues that the Colorado Governmental Immunity Statute would have permitted such 
</p>
<p>a suit had she been able to meet this standard. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>563. The State claims that the fact that Ms. J. L. G. did not obtain positive results at 
</p>
<p>the federal judicial level through the decision of the United States Supreme Court in 
</p>
<p>this specific case, does not mean that domestic violence victims do not have resources 
</p>
<p>available to them at the state or local level or that protection orders do not effectively 
</p>
<p>protect their beneficiaries. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>564. The Government also describes a series of additional remedies and protections 
</p>
<p>for victims of domestic violence at the national and state levels, such as a large sums 
</p>
<p>of money devoted to implement programs related to domestic violence, as well as a 
</p>
<p>diversity of laws that have been designed to improve the investigation of domestic 
</p>
<p>violence cases.

<p><b>Reply of the Government to a communication sent in 2006 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>566. On <b>21 July 2006</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against woman, jointly 
</p>
<p>with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
</p>
<p>rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning Ms. M. T., a human rights activist. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>567. On 7 July 2006, M. T. was transferred to the psychiatric department of the 
</p>
<p>Tashkent women&#8217;s prison. On 13 July 2006, her two lawyers went to visit her and 
</p>
<p>reported that her physical condition had markedly deteriorated, one of her hands was 
</p>
<p>bandaged and she uncharacteristically talked very slowly. When asked by one of her 
</p>
<p>lawyers how her hand was damaged, she did not reply. She did say, however, that she 
</p>
<p>has to take pills every day without being informed about what type of pills she is 
</p>
<p>given. She is kept in a room with 16 drug users and persons with mental problems. 
</p>
<p>On 14 July 2006, her lawyers sent a letter to the prison director to find out why M. T. 
</p>
<p>was transferred to the psychiatric department, but they did not receive a reply.***** 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>568. On <b>14 August 2007</b>, the Government sent a letter which stated that false 
</p>
<p>information was disseminated by mass media and NGOs about Ms. M. T,&#8217;s health 
</p>
<p>conditions. It is reported that, according to the decision of the Court, Ms. M. T. had 
</p>
<p>pledged guilty for committing such crimes as blackmail, robbery, embezzlement 
</p>
<p>through appropriation and misapplication, fraud, evasion from tax payments, 
</p>
<p>violation of trade rules and land tenure conditions, functional forgery, arbitrariness, 
</p>
<p>distribution of materials containing threat to public safety and order. On 6 March 
</p>
<p>2007, she was convicted to 8 years of imprisonment with the deprivation of the right 
</p>
<p>to take up any administrative and financially-liable positions within 3 years. 
</p>

</p>
<p>569. The Government affirmed that since 7 July 2006, Ms. M. T. was serving a 
</p>
<p>sentence in the colony of general regime and she had a right for health protection, 
</p>
<p>including medical care outlined in the Criminal-Executive Code of Uzbekistan. She 
</p>
<p>already contacted the medical unit of the colony and underwent in-patient treatment 
</p>
<p>twice. On 11 August 2007, the medical examination states her health condition is 
</p>
<p>satisfactory and she is able to work. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>570. The government listed the four meetings with relatives Ms. M. T. had in 
</p>
<p>accordance with article 9 of the Criminal-Executive Code: 
</p>
<p>- on 19 July 2006, a short meeting with her nephew, Mr. G. U. 
</p>
<p>- on 10 August 2006, a 3 day-meeting with her sister Ms. M. T. 
</p>
<p>- on 9 January 2007, a short meeting with her daughter Ms. M. T. 
</p>
<p>- on 10 August 2007, a short meeting with her younger brother Mr. R. T. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>571. Furthermore, it is claimed that, in accordance with written request by Ms. M. 
</p>
<p>T., lawyer Ms. D. N. visited her on 13 July 2006. Afterwards she never requested 
</p>
<p>such visit. Finally, it is alleged that Ms. M. T. regularly receives parcels and packets 
</p>
<p>from relatives. She also received and sent numerous letters to and from relatives. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>572. On <b>13 April 2007</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
</p>
<p>causes and consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
</p>
<p>torture, and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders, sent an Urgent appeal to the Government regarding Ms. M. 
</p>
<p>T., Chairperson of the human rights organization <i>Plammenoe Serdtse</i>, Ardent Hearts 
</p>
<p>Club, based in Ferghana City. She is also one of the founders of the national 
</p>
<p>movement Civil Society and a 2005 Nobel Peace Prize nominee. Ms. M. T. was the 
</p>
<p>subject of a communication sent by the Special Rapporteur on violence against 
</p>
<p>women, its causes and consequences, jointly with the Special Representative to the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General for human rights defenders on 21 July 2006.   
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>573. Ms. M. T. was also the subject of a communication sent by the Special

promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the 
</p>
<p>Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders on 6 February 2006; of a communication sent by the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>violence against women, its causes and consequences jointly with the Special 
</p>
<p>Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 
</p>
<p>18 July 2005; and of a communication sent by the Special Rapporteur on violence 
</p>
<p>against women, its causes and consequences, with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
</p>
<p>Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Representative of the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 27 October 2005.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>574. According to information received: On 6 March 2006, Ms. M. T. was sentenced 
</p>
<p>to 8 years in prison. She is currently being detained at Tashkent Prison.  Ms. M. T. 
</p>
<p>reportedly spent seven months in solitary confinement and was held in a psychiatric 
</p>
<p>unit for mentally ill and drug-addicted persons, located in a women's detention centre 
</p>
<p>in the Mirabad district of Tashkent. Ms. M. T.&#8217;s health is deteriorating as a result of 
</p>
<p>the conditions in which she is being held and is in need of urgent medical attention.  It 
</p>
<p>is reported that she has lost approximately 20 kilograms in weight and is suffering 
</p>
<p>from a kidney-related illness caused by cold and low blood pressure. Ms. M. T. was 
</p>
<p>last seen by her family on 9 January 2007 despite numerous attempts by relatives to 
</p>
<p>visit her at the detention centre in order to bring her medication and food.    
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>575. According to reports, members of Ms. M. T.&#8217;s family, including her brother Mr. 
</p>
<p>R. T. and her daughter Ms. M. A., have been subjected to harassment and 
</p>
<p>intimidation.  On 22 December 2006 Mr. R. T. was evicted from his apartment and is 
</p>
<p>under constant surveillance by the authorities.  He has also received a warning that if 
</p>
<p>he continues to object to the detention of his sister it will be difficult for him to 
</p>
<p>continue to work and he will be forced to leave Tashkent. She was also warned that if 
</p>
<p>she would then travel to Tashkent again (to see her mother) she will be killed. Ms. M. 
</p>
<p>A. has been followed by individuals believed to be law enforcement agents.   
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>576. Concern is expressed that the above-mentioned events form part of an ongoing 
</p>
<p>campaign to silence human rights defenders in Uzbekistan. Grave concern is also </p>

       Page 150 
</p>
<p>expressed at the reported ill-treatment of Ms. M. T. and consequent deterioration of 
</p>
<p>her health.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government  
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>577. On <b>26 April 2007</b>, the Uzbekistan Government replied to the letter sent on 13 
</p>
<p>April 2007. It made reference to a series of provisions regarding citizens&#8217; rights and 
</p>
<p>freedoms such as article 27 of the Constitution, the Law &#8220;On citizens&#8217; applications&#8221; 
</p>
<p>and criminal and administrative legislations. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>578. Moreover, the Government affirmed that judicial and non-judicial institutions 
</p>
<p>on protection of human rights and freedoms were established and successfully 
</p>
<p>functioned, which facilitated timely reaction to citizens&#8217; applications and the adoption 
</p>
<p>of fair decisions upon issues raised. However, it claimed that some citizens, 
</p>
<p>&#8220;pretending to be a victim of alleged violations by State bodies, premeditatedly refuse 
</p>
<p>to submit applications to such institutions and instead target the attraction of attention 
</p>
<p>of international human rights or other organizations to themselves. Thus, they pursue 
</p>
<p>a political purpose to cause a wave of criticism against Uzbekistan.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>579. Finally, the Government advised the Special Rapporteur to inform Ms. M. T. to 
</p>
<p>appeal to competent bodies in Uzbekistan to restore her rights, provided that alleged 
</p>
<p>violations have taken place. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>580. On <b>10 July 2007</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
</p>
<p>and consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, the 
</p>
<p>Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning Ms. M. T., 
</p>
<p>Chairperson of the human rights organization <i>Plammenoe Serdtse</i>, Ardent Hearts 
</p>
<p>Club, based in Ferghana City. She is also one of the founders of the national 
</p>
<p>movement <i>Civil Society</i> and a 2005 Nobel Peace Prize nominee.  Ms. M. T. has been 
</p>
<p>the subject of numerous urgent appeals by special procedures mandates. Government </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
Page 151 
 
responses dated 10 and 26 April 2007 have been noted. However, according to recent 
</p>
<p>allegations received: 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>581. Ms. M. T. is being ill-treated by prison wardens whilst in detention in Tashkent 
</p>
<p>prison, and this ill-treatment is having adverse effects on her health. She is frequently 
</p>
<p>being humiliated and threatened with acts of violence against her daughter. She is also 
</p>
<p>placed in solitary confinement, and has been denied access to medical treatment 
</p>
<p>which she urgently requires. In addition, she has been denied her visitation rights, and 
</p>
<p>delegates from the International Committee of the Red Cross have been prevented 
</p>
<p>from seeing her.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>582. Serious concern is expressed at the reported continuing ill-treatment of Ms. M. 
</p>
<p>T. and the consequent deterioration of her health. Further concern is expressed that 
</p>
<p>the above-mentioned events may form part of an ongoing attempt to silence human 
</p>
<p>rights defenders in Uzbekistan. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>583. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government for its replies to 
</p>
<p>some of her communications. With respect to the Government&#8217;s reply of 26 April 
</p>
<p>2007 to her communication dated 13 April 2007, the Special Rapporteur would like to 
</p>
<p>remind the Government of Uzbekistan that the special procedures mechanism of 
</p>
<p>communications to and from Governments, as established by Member States, does not 
</p>
<p>prevent any citizen from applying to the national protection mechanisms in place in 
</p>
<p>his/her country. The two sets of mechanisms are complementary. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur further notes that the Commission on Human Rights, in its resolution 
</p>
<p>2005/41, paragraph 17 (a), stressed &#8220;that States have an affirmative duty to promote 
</p>
<p>and protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls and must 
</p>
<p>exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate and punish all acts of violence against 
</p>
<p>women and girls, and [called] upon States to apply international human rights norms 
</p>
<p>and to consider, as a matter of priority, becoming party to international human rights 
</p>
<p>instruments that relate to violence against women and girls, and to implement fully 
</p>
<p>their international obligations.&#8221; </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.1 
       Page 152 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>584. Finally, the Special Rapporteur would be interested to know whether the case 
</p>
<p>reported in the communication of 10 July 2007 has resulted in any investigations into 
</p>
<p>alleged ill-treatment by prison wardens.
