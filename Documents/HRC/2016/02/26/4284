<p> <i>The Human Rights Council, 
</i></p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>all previous resolutions and decisions adopted by the Commission on 
Human Rights in connection with the effects of structural adjustment and economic reform 
policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, 
social and cultural rights, including resolutions 1998/24 of 17 April 1998, 1999/22 of 23 
April 1999, 2000/82 of 26 April 2000, 2004/18 of 16 April 2004 and 2005/19 of 14 April 
2005, as well as Human Rights Council decision 2/109 of 27 November 2006 and Council 
resolutions 7/4 of 27 March 2008, 11/5 of 17 June 2009, and 14/4 of 17 June 2010, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>its resolutions 5/1, entitled &#8220;Institution-building of the United Nations 
Human Rights Council&#8221;, and 5/2, entitled &#8220;Code of Conduct for Special Procedures 
Mandate-holders of the Human Rights Council&#8221;, of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the 
mandate holder shall discharge his/her duties in accordance with these resolutions and the 
annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>that, despite the efforts made, the effects of the debt problem are not over and 
that heavy debt burdens continue to contribute to extreme poverty and to undermine the 
capacity of Governments, particularly in developing countries, to create the conditions 
necessary for the achievement of sustainable human development and the realization of 
human rights, </p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> that the World Conference on Human Rights agreed to call upon the 
international community to make all efforts to help to alleviate the external debt burden of 
low- and middle-income developing countries in order to supplement the efforts of the 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p>Governments of such countries to attain the full realization of the economic, social and 
cultural rights of their people,

2006,

to improving them, as appropriate, and to present updated draft general guidelines to the 
Council;  
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Further requests </i>the Independent Expert to cooperate, in accordance with 
his/her mandate, with the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as well as 
with the Advisory Committee, special procedures, mechanisms and relevant working 
groups of the Council related to economic, social and cultural rights and the right to 
development, in his/her work towards the improvement of the above-mentioned draft 
general guidelines; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Requests </i>the Secretary-General to provide the Independent Expert with all
