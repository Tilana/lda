For The Three Months  
Ended March 31, 2007
F I N A N C I A L   &   O P E R A T I N G   H I G H L I G H T S
Zargon Energy Trust is pleased to report its financial results for the first quarter of 2007. 
Funds flow from operations was $21.80 million ($1.12 per diluted trust unit) in the 2007 
first quarter compared with $18.84 million ($0.97 per diluted trust unit) in the 2006 fourth 
quarter and $22.12 million ($1.15 per diluted trust unit) in the 2006 first quarter.
Highlights from the three months ended March 31, 2007 are noted below:  
(cid:121)  First  quarter  2007  production  averaged  8,483  barrels  of  oil  equivalent  per  day,  one 
percent  above  the  preceding  quarter  and  a  decrease  of  four  percent  from  the 
corresponding  quarter  of  2006.  First  quarter  production  volumes  increased  from  the 
prior  quarter  due  to  the  tie-in  of  wells  from  the  multi-well  program  in  the  Jarrow  and 
Hamilton Lake properties of the Alberta Plains core area, as well as new volumes from 
the  tie-in  of  successful  wells  from  the  West  Central  Alberta  core  area  winter  drilling 
program. For the first three months of 2007, this production rate equals 436 barrels of 
oil  equivalent  per  day  per  million  trust  units  outstanding  compared  to  431  and  462 
barrels of oil equivalent per day per million trust units outstanding for the prior quarter 
and corresponding quarter of 2006, respectively.
(cid:121)  Revenue and funds flow from operations in the 2007 first quarter increased six percent 
and 16 percent, respectively, from the prior quarter. Increased realized oil prices of four 
percent and increased realized natural gas prices of nine percent from the prior quarter 
along with realized risk management gains were partially offset by increased production 
costs during the quarter.
(cid:121)  The Trust declared three monthly cash distributions of $0.18 per trust unit in the first 
quarter of 2007 for a total of $9.12 million. These cash distributions were equivalent to a 
payout ratio of 48 percent of the Trust’s first quarter funds flow on a diluted trust unit 
basis  and  after  considering  the  effect  of  the  exchangeable  shares  not  receiving 
distributions, the distributions amounted to 42 percent of funds flow from operations.
(cid:121)  The  Trust’s  first  quarter  exploration  and  development  capital  expenditures  increased 
three  percent  from  the  prior  quarter  to  $20.84  million  as  a  result  of  a  14.4  net  well 
drilling  program  as  well  as  increased  well  equipping  and  facility  costs.  Debt  net  of 
working capital (excluding unrealized risk management assets and liabilities) increased 
to $47.18 million at March 31, 2007 and the Trust's balance sheet remains strong with a 
debt net of working capital to annualized funds flow ratio at 0.5 times.

Notes: 
Throughout  this  report,  funds  flow  from  operations,  funds  flow  from  operations  per  diluted  unit  and  funds  flow  netbacks  are  now 
calculated inclusive of asset retirement expenditures. All prior period calculations have been restated to reflect this change.   
Throughout this report, the calculation of barrels of oil equivalent (“boe”) is based on the conversion ratio that six thousand cubic feet 
of natural gas is equivalent to one barrel of oil. For a further discussion about this term, refer to the Management’s Discussion and 
Analysis section in this report. 
Funds flow from operations is a non-GAAP term that represents net earnings and asset retirement expenditures except for non-cash 
items. For a further discussion about this term, refer to the Management’s Discussion and Analysis section in this report. 
Total units outstanding include trust units plus exchangeable shares outstanding at period end. The exchangeable shares are converted 
at the exchange ratio at the end of the period. 
Average daily production per million trust units is calculated using the weighted average number of units outstanding during the period, 
plus the weighted average number of exchangeable shares outstanding for the period converted at the average exchange ratio for the 
period.

PRODUCTION (1)
Natural gas production volumes in the first quarter of 2007 averaged 28.44 million cubic feet per day, a four 
percent  increase  from  the  previous  quarter  and  a  two  percent  reduction  from  the  corresponding  period  of 
2006.  The first quarter natural gas production gains were a result of well tie-ins coming from last year’s multi-
well  development  programs  at  Hamilton  Lake  and  Jarrow  in  the  Alberta  Plains  core  area  as  well  as  new 
volumes from the ongoing West Central Alberta tie-ins.   During the first eight months of this year, Zargon will 
tie-in over four million cubic feet per day of new West Central Alberta natural gas production, primarily resulting 
from last year’s exploration successes.
Oil and liquids production was 3,742 barrels per day in the 2007 first quarter, a one percent reduction from the 
preceding quarter and a six percent reduction from the corresponding 2006 quarter. Production volumes held 
relatively  steady  compared  to  the  prior  quarter  as  new  Williston  Basin  volumes  from  horizontal  wells  at 
Steelman and Haas offset naturally occurring production declines. Over the next few months, oil production 
volumes  are  anticipated  to  remain  relatively  stable  as  natural  declines  continue  to  be  offset  by  our  ongoing 
Williston Basin horizontal exploitation programs.   
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (1)
During the first quarter of 2007, Zargon drilled 17 gross wells (14.4 net) that resulted in 11.8 net natural gas 
wells, 2.0 net oil wells and 0.6 net dry holes for a 95 percent success ratio. Natural gas wells drilled in the first 
quarter include 8.6 net wells as part of the multi-well program at Jarrow in the Alberta Plains core area and 2.0 
net wells at Pembina, 0.7 net wells in the Peace River Arch and 0.5 net wells at Highvale in the West Central 
Alberta core area. In the Williston Basin core area, 2.0 net horizontal wells were drilled, one each at Manor and 
Weyburn, Saskatchewan.
Following  spring  break-up,  Zargon  will  return  to  a  moderated  field  program  focused  on  tie-ins  and  facility 
optimization at Jarrow, a seismically driven Jarrow natural gas exploration program, a multi-well development 
drilling  program  at  Hamilton  Lake  in  the  Alberta  Plains  core  area  and  the  continuation  of  the  West  Central 
Alberta tie-ins.  In the Williston Basin, Zargon will resume its ongoing horizontal drilling program with wells at 
Elswick, Pinto and Steelman, Saskatchewan and at Mackobee Coulee, North Dakota.
Recently, the cost of acquiring land at Crown land sales has continued to decline and accordingly, Zargon has 
been able to increase its undeveloped land inventory with moderately priced purchases. Zargon’s undeveloped 
land inventory at March 31, 2007 was 386 thousand net acres, up five thousand net acres from the balance 
reported at the end of 2006.
For  the  last  two  years,  Zargon  has  been  a  net  seller  of  oil  and  natural  gas assets  during  a  very  competitive 
period for oil and natural gas property acquisitions.  However, in recent months improved values appear to be 
available in the property and acquisition market and subsequent to quarter-end, Zargon has entered into three 
acquisition transactions aggregating $2.2 million for assets relating to existing properties in each of Zargon’s 
core areas. It is anticipated that the combination of Zargon’s strong balance sheet and the industry’s improved 
acquisition metrics should permit Zargon to be an active participant in the property and corporate acquisition 
market over the next few quarters.  Acquisition programs can be funded by debt or equity and will be focused 
on either explorable and developable Alberta natural gas properties or exploitable Williston Basin oil properties.
GUIDANCE (1)
In  the  March  13,  2007  press  release  announcing  the  2006  fourth  quarter  and  full  year  results,  Zargon 
reconfirmed its 2007 full year production guidance of 8,750 barrels of oil equivalent per day based on a $55 
million capital program. For the first three months of 2007, Zargon previously provided production guidance of 
8,500  barrels  of  oil  equivalent per  day  and actual  production essentially  met  guidance  at  8,483  barrels  of oil 
equivalent  per day.   As  the impact  of  the West  Central Alberta  tie-ins  are  realized,  second quarter  and  third 
quarter  2007  production  volumes  are  also  anticipated  to  show  small  successive  gains.    However,  due  to 
regulatory delays and due to challenges pertaining to the availability of third party processing and transportation 
services, the timing for some of the production gains has been deferred and although the 8,750 barrels of oil 
equivalent per day production rate is anticipated to be reached this fall, the full year guidance estimate of 8,750
2007 FIRST QUARTER REPORT
3
barrels of oil equivalent per day is no longer assured.  Consequently, as of the date of this report, Zargon is 
slightly modifying the 2007 guidance to provide an estimated guidance range of 8,600 to 8,750 barrels of oil 
equivalent per day.
This guidance range estimate is premised on the planned 2007 exploration and development capital program of 
$55 million which includes the drilling of 65 net wells. The allocation of this capital program is now forecast to 
be  $24  million  to  the  Alberta  Plains,  $17  million  to  the  Williston  Basin  and  $14  million  to  the  West  Central 
Alberta core areas. The capital program will primarily focus on Williston Basin oil exploitation, multi-well Alberta 
Plains  natural  gas  development,  selected  West  Central  Alberta  gas  well  development  programs  and  will 
continue  to  include  a  25  percent  exploration  component.  The  2007  exploration  programs  will  include 
seismically defined Alberta Plains Mannville targets, selected larger scope Williston Basin exploration concepts 
and West Central Alberta seismically defined structural and stratigraphic targets at the Peace River Arch and 
Highvale properties.
During the first three months of 2007, Zargon has maintained a base (sustainable) monthly distribution of $0.18 
per  trust  unit  which  is  based  on  Zargon’s  sustainable  trust  strategy  that  targets  for  the  distribution  of 
approximately  50  percent  of  the  Trust’s  funds  flow  from  operations  attributed  to  the  unitholders.  For  the 
remainder of this year, Zargon plans to continue with its base (sustainable) monthly distribution of $0.18 per 
trust  unit  which  is  premised  on  the  current  2007  production  guidance  levels,  positive  contributions  from 
current risk management contracts and the long term commodity price assumptions of US $55 per barrel (WTI 
oil), a US $7.50 per mmbtu (NYMEX natural gas) price and an $0.87 Cdn/US dollar currency exchange rate.

Management’s  discussion  and  analysis  (“MD&A”)  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  unaudited  interim 
consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2007 and the audited consolidated financial 
statements and MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2006. All amounts are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise 
noted. All references to “Zargon” or the “Trust” refer to Zargon Energy Trust.
In the MD&A, reserves and production are commonly stated in barrels of oil equivalent (“boe”) on the basis that six 
thousand cubic feet of natural gas is equivalent to one barrel of oil. Boes may be misleading, particularly if used in 
isolation. A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil is based on an energy 
equivalent conversion method primarily applicable to the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalent at the 
wellhead.
The following are descriptions of non-GAAP measures used in this MD&A: 
(cid:121)  The  MD&A  contains  the  term  “funds  flow  from  operations”  (“funds  flow”),  which  should  not  be  considered  an 
alternative  to  or  more  meaningful  than,  “cash  flow  from  operating  activities”  as  determined  in  accordance  with 
Canadian  GAAP  as  an  indicator  of  the  Trust’s  financial  performance.  This  term  does  not  have  any  standardized 
meaning as prescribed by GAAP and therefore, the Trust’s determination of funds flow from operations may not be 
comparable  to  that  reported  by  other  trusts.  The  reconciliation  between  net  earnings  and  funds  flow  from 
operations can be found in the unaudited interim consolidated statements of cash flows in the unaudited interim 
consolidated financial statements. The Trust evaluates its performance based on net earnings and funds flow from 
operations.  The  Trust  considers  funds  flow  from  operations  to  be  a  key  measure  as  it  demonstrates  the  Trust’s 
ability to generate the cash necessary to pay distributions, repay debt and to fund future capital investment. It is 
also used by research analysts to value and compare oil and gas trusts, and it is frequently included in published 
research when providing investment recommendations. Funds flow from operations per unit is calculated using the 
diluted weighted average number of units for the period.
(cid:121)  Payout ratio equals cash distributions as a percentage of funds flow for the period. Payout ratio is a useful measure
used by management to analyze the Trust’s efficiency and sustainability.
(cid:121)  The Trust also uses the term “debt net of working capital”. Debt net of working capital as presented does not have 
any standardized meaning prescribed by Canadian GAAP and may not be comparable with the calculation of similar 
measures for other entities. Debt net of working capital as used by the Trust is calculated as bank debt and any 
working capital deficit excluding the current portion of unrealized risk management assets and liabilities.
(cid:121)  Operating netbacks equal total petroleum and natural gas revenue per boe adjusted for realized risk management 
gains  and/or  losses  per  boe,  royalties  per  boe  and  production  costs  per  boe.  Operating  netbacks  are  a  useful 
measure to compare the Trust’s operations with those of its peers.
(cid:121)  Funds  flow  netbacks  per  boe  are  calculated  as  operating  netbacks  less  general  and  administrative  expenses  per 
boe, interest and financing charges per boe, asset retirement expenditures per boe and capital and current income 
taxes per boe. Funds flow netbacks are a useful measure to compare the Trust’s operations with those of its peers.
References to “production volumes” or “production” in this MD&A refer to sales volumes.
Forward-Looking Statements - This document contains statements that are forward-looking, such as those relating to 
results  of  operations  and  financial  condition,  capital  spending,  financing  sources,  commodity  prices,  costs  of 
production and the magnitude of oil and natural gas reserves. By their nature, forward-looking statements are subject 
to  numerous  risks  and  uncertainties  that  could  significantly  affect  anticipated  results  in  the  future  and,  accordingly 
actual results may differ materially from those predicted. The forward-looking statements contained in this report are 
as of May 11, 2007 and are subject to change after this date. Readers are cautioned that the assumptions used in the 
preparation  of  such  information,  although  considered  reasonable  at  the  time  of  preparation,  may  prove  to  be 
imprecise and, as such, undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements. Zargon disclaims, except 
as required by law, any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result 
of new information, future events or otherwise.

(cid:121)  During the first quarter of 2007, the Trust realized funds flow from operations of $21.80 million and declared 
total distributions of $9.12 million ($0.54 per trust unit) to unitholders, resulting in a quarterly payout ratio of 
42 percent of funds flow or 48 percent on a per diluted trust unit basis. For Canadian income tax purposes, 
the distributions are currently estimated to be 100 percent taxable income to unitholders.
(cid:121)  Average field prices received (before the impact of financial risk management contracts) for oil and liquids 
and for natural gas prices increased four percent to $57.04 per barrel and nine percent to $7.55 per thousand 
cubic  feet,  respectively,  compared  to  the  fourth  quarter  of  2006.  First  quarter  production  volumes  were 
8,483 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a one percent increase from the fourth quarter 2006 production levels. 
(cid:121)  During the first quarter of 2007, the Trust drilled 17 gross wells (14.4 net) with a 95 percent success rate. 
Total net capital expenditures were $20.93 million for the quarter compared to $20.41 million for the prior 
quarter.
(cid:121)  The  Trust  continues  to  maintain  a  strong  balance  sheet  with  a  combined  debt  net  of  working  capital 
(excluding  unrealized  risk  management  assets  and  liabilities)  of  $47.18  million,  which  represents  slightly 
more than six months of the 2007 year-to-date annualized funds flow.
F I N A N C I A L   A N A L Y S I S
First quarter 2007 revenue of $38.53 million was six percent above the $36.50 million in the fourth quarter of 
2006 and six percent below the $40.94 million in the first quarter of 2006. A nine percent increase in natural 
gas prices received and a four percent increase in oil and liquids prices received, were the primary reasons for 
the increased revenues when compared to the prior quarter amounts. Average daily production volumes also 
showed slight gains with a one percent increase over the prior quarter rate. First quarter 2007 realized oil and 
liquids field prices averaged $57.04 per barrel before the impact of financial risk management contracts and 
were four percent higher from the preceding quarter’s $54.69 per barrel and were three percent higher than 
the  $55.51  per  barrel  recorded  in  the  2006  first  quarter.  Zargon’s  crude  oil  field  price  differential  from  the 
Edmonton par price increased to $10.05 per barrel in the first quarter of 2007 compared to $9.80 per barrel in 
the fourth quarter of 2006. Natural gas field prices received averaged $7.55 per thousand cubic feet before the 
impact of financial risk management contracts in the first quarter of 2007, a decrease of six percent from the 
2006  first  quarter  prices  received  and  a  nine  percent  increase  from  the  preceding  quarter  levels.  Zargon’s 
realized field prices differ from the benchmark AECO average daily price due to a combination of fixed price 
physical contracts (see note 10 to the interim unaudited consolidated financial statements) and from the impact 
of Zargon receiving AECO monthly index pricing for a portion of its natural gas production.

Natural gas production volumes increased by four percent in the first quarter of 2007 to 28.44 million cubic feet 
per day from 27.46 million cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter of 2006 and were two percent lower than 
the  2006  first  quarter.  Oil  and  liquids  production  during  the  first  quarter  of  2007  was  3,742  barrels  per  day 
which is one percent below the 2006 fourth quarter rate of 3,789 barrels per day and six percent below the 
first quarter of 2006 level. The year-over-year decrease in oil and liquids production is primarily due to the effect 
of naturally occurring production declines (specifically related to first quarter 2006 flush production rates from 
certain  Williston  Basin  wells)  and  2006  non-core  property  sales.  On  a  barrel  of  oil  equivalent  basis,  Zargon 
produced 8,483 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter of 2007, which represents a one percent 
increase  from  the  8,366  barrels  of  oil  equivalent  per  day  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2006  and  a  four  percent 
decrease when compared to the first quarter of 2006.

Zargon’s  commodity  price  risk management  policy,  which  is approved  by  the  Board  of Directors,  allows  the 
use of forward sales and costless collars for a targeted range of 20 to 35 percent of oil and natural gas working 
interest production in order to partially offset the effects of large commodity price fluctuations. Financial risk 
management contracts in place as at December 31, 2004 were designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
and the Trust monitored these contracts in determining the continuation of hedge effectiveness. As at June 
30, 2006, all designated hedge contracts had expired. For the designated hedge contracts, realized gains and 
losses were recorded in the statements of earnings as the contracts settled and no unrealized gain or loss was 
recognized. For financial risk management contracts entered into after December 31, 2004, the Trust considers 
these  contracts  to  be  effective  on  an  economic  basis  but  has  decided  not  to  designate  these  contracts  as 
hedges  for  accounting  purposes  and  accordingly,  for  these  contracts,  an  unrealized  gain  or  loss  is  recorded 
based on the fair value (mark-to-market) of the contracts at the period end.
2007 FIRST QUARTER REPORT
7
Specifically,  in  the  2007  first  quarter,  relatively  lower  oil  and  natural  gas  prices  brought  about  a  net  realized 
financial risk management gain totalling $2.33 million (consisting of a $1.08 million gain on natural gas contracts 
and a $1.25 million gain on oil contracts) that compares to a $1.16 million realized net gain in the fourth quarter 
of 2006 and a $1.36 million realized net loss in the first quarter of 2006. The 2007 first quarter unrealized risk 
management loss resulted from oil contract losses ($2.80 million) and by unrealized risk management natural 
gas contract losses ($3.04 million) providing a total loss of $5.84 million for the quarter which compares to a 
net $0.80 million gain for the 2006 fourth quarter and a net $2.49 million gain in the first quarter of 2006. These 
unrealized risk management gains or losses are generated by the change over the reporting period in the mark-
to-market  valuation  of  Zargon’s  future  contracts.  Zargon’s  commodity  risk  management  positions  are  fully 
described in note 10 to the unaudited consolidated interim financial statements.
Royalties,  inclusive  of  the  Saskatchewan  Resource  Surcharge,  totalled  $8.33  million  for  the  first  quarter  of 
2007,  an  increase  of  six  percent  from  the  $7.84  million  preceding  quarter  expense  and  a  decrease  of  eight 
percent  from  $9.02  million  in  the  first  quarter of  2006.  The  variations  generally  track  changes  in  production, 
prices and volumes. As a percentage of gross revenue, royalty rates moved in a relatively narrow range from 
22.0 percent in the first quarter of 2006 to 21.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 and 21.6 percent in the 
first  quarter  of  2007.  Recent  lower  than  expected  royalty  rates  are  also  due  to  the  effect  of  revenue  gains 
Zargon has achieved due to fixed price and monthly index physical contracts. Going forward, Zargon expects 
that  its  royalty  rate  will  approximate  22  to  23  percent  for  the  next  few  quarters.  During  the  third  quarter  of 
2006,  the  Alberta  Provincial  Government  announced  the  elimination  of  the  Alberta  Royalty  Credit  effective 
January  1,  2007.  The  estimated  impact  of  this  announcement  is  an  increase  of  royalty  expense  of 
approximately $0.50 million per year for fiscal years commencing in 2007.
On a unit of production basis, production costs of $10.32 per barrel of oil equivalent in the first quarter of 2007 
compares with $9.92 per barrel of oil equivalent in the preceding quarter and $7.55 per barrel of oil equivalent 
in  the  first  quarter  of  2006.  The  large  increase  in  the  2007  first  quarter  costs  relate  to  adjustments  to  prior 
periods  on  non-operated  properties  ($0.30  per  barrel  of  oil  equivalent),  a  seasonally  active  pre-spring 
maintenance and workover field program, increased water handling and transportation costs, and the industry-
wide trend of increased unit operating costs. Despite continued efforts to contain the industry-wide trend of 
increasing operating costs, Zargon anticipates that production costs will average between $9.25 to $9.75 per 
barrel of oil equivalent for the 2007 year.

Measured on a unit of production basis (net of recoveries), general and administrative expenses were $2.06 
per barrel of oil equivalent in the first three months of 2007 compared to $1.92 in the first three months of 
2006 and $2.27 for the twelve month period of 2006. The year-over-year increase in general and administrative 
expenses  on  a  per  unit  of  production  basis  are  primarily  due  to  additional  office  lease  costs  and  the  costs 
related to the expansion of Zargon’s technical staff.
Expensing  of  unit-based  compensation  in  the  first  three  months  of  2007  was  $0.36  million,  a  13  percent 
increase from the first three months of 2006. The increase is a result of unit right grants which generally occur 
on a quarterly basis.

ZARGON ENERGY TRUST
Zargon’s borrowings are through its syndicated bank credit facilities. Interest and financing charges on these 
facilities in the 2007 first quarter were $0.57 million, $0.10 million higher than the previous quarter amount of 
$0.47 million and an increase of $0.26 million from $0.31 million in the first quarter of 2006. This year-over-year 
increase  is  primarily  due  to  a  combination  of  higher  average  bank  debt  levels  and  higher  effective  interest 
rates. As noted in prior quarters, on June 30, 2006, Zargon amended and renewed its syndicated committed 
credit facilities, which resulted in an increase in the available facilities and borrowing base to $100 million from 
the previous amount of $80 million. The next renewal date is July 31, 2007.
Capital and current taxes for the 2007 first quarter were $0.48 million, primarily relating to the United States 
operations, where increased taxable income is resulting in higher United States taxes. When compared to prior 
periods,  capital  and  current  income  taxes  increased  $0.09  million  over  the  2006  first  quarter  and  decreased 
$0.18 million relative to the fourth quarter of 2006.  Tax pools as at March 31, 2007 are approximately $123 
million  which  represents  an  increase  from  the  comparable  $113  million  of  tax  pools  available  to  Zargon  at 
December 31, 2006.
On October 31, 2006, the Federal Government announced tax proposals pertaining to taxation of distributions 
paid by trusts and the personal tax treatment of trust distributions. Currently, the Trust does not pay tax on 
distributions as tax is paid by the unitholders. If enacted, the proposals would result in taxation of distributions 
at the Trust level at a rate of 31.5 percent effective January 1, 2011. As the proposals are not yet substantively 
enacted,  there  is  no  impact  on  the  results  of  the  Trust  for  the  period  ended  March  31,  2007.  The  Trust  is 
continuing to assess the proposals and the potential implications to the Trust.

Depletion  and  depreciation  expense  for  the  first  quarter  of  2007  increased  six  percent  to  $11.54  million, 
compared to $10.86 million in the prior quarter and increased 13 percent when compared to the first quarter 
2006 expense of $10.19 million. On a per barrel of oil equivalent basis, the depletion and depreciation rates 
were  $12.85,  $14.11  and  $15.12  for  the  first  and  fourth  quarters  of  2006  and  the  first  quarter  of  2007, 
respectively. The primary reasons for the year-over-year expense increase are due to the impact of last year’s 
increased  finding,  development  and  acquisition  costs  and  from  the  financial  impact  of  the  conversion  of 
exchangeable shares pursuant to the application of EIC-151.
The provision for accretion of asset retirement obligations for the first three months of 2007 was $0.32 million, 
a  five  percent  increase  compared  to  the  first  three  months  of  2006.  The  year-over-year  change  is  due  to 
changes  in  the  estimated  future  liability  for  asset  retirement  obligations  as  a  result  of  wells  added  through 
Zargon’s drilling program.
2007 FIRST QUARTER REPORT
9
The recovery of future taxes for the first quarter of 2007 was $2.00 million when compared to a recovery of 
$0.79 million in the prior quarter and a provision for future tax expense of $0.21 million in the first quarter of 
2006. The 2007 first quarter increase in future tax recovery is primarily a result of the increase in unrealized risk 
management losses in the quarter. Effectively, Zargon’s future tax obligations are reduced as distributions are 
made from the Trust and consequently it is anticipated that Zargon’s effective tax rate will continue to be low.
According  to  the  January  19,  2005  CICA  pronouncement,  EIC-151  “Exchangeable  Securities  Issued  by 
Subsidiaries  of  Income  Trusts”,  Zargon  Energy  Trust  must  reflect  the  exchangeable  securities  issued  by  its 
subsidiary (Zargon Oil & Gas Ltd.) as a non-controlling interest. Prior to 2005, these exchangeable shares were 
reflected as a component of unitholders’ equity. Accordingly, the Trust has reflected a non-controlling interest 
of $18.36 million on the Trust’s consolidated balance sheet as at March 31, 2007. Consolidated net earnings 
have  been  reduced  for  net  earnings  attributable  to  the  non-controlling  interest  of  $0.81  million  in  the  first 
quarter of 2007. In accordance with EIC-151 and given the circumstances in Zargon’s case, each exchangeable 
share redemption is accounted for as a step-purchase, which in the first quarter of 2007 resulted in an increase 
in property and equipment of $7.08 million, an increase in unitholders’ equity of $2.43 million and an increase in 
future income tax liability of $5.41 million. Funds flow was not impacted by this change. The cumulative impact 
to  date  of  the  application  of  EIC-151  has  been  to  increase  property  and  equipment  by  $50.02  million, 
unitholders’ equity and non-controlling interest by $49.19 million, future income tax liability by $16.64 million 
and an allocation of net earnings to exchangeable shareholders’ of $15.81 million.
Funds flow from operations in the 2007 first quarter of $21.80 million was $2.96 million, or 16 percent higher 
than the preceding quarter and $0.33 million or one percent lower than the prior year first quarter. The increase 
in  funds  flow  from  the  preceding  quarter  was  primarily  due  to  increased  average  field  commodity  prices 
received and realized risk management contract gains. Compared to the prior year first quarter, a two percent 
decline in commodity prices, a four percent decline in production volumes, and rising production costs were 
only partially offset by first quarter realized risk management contract gains. Funds flow on a per diluted trust 
unit  basis  was  $1.12  for  the  first  quarter  of  2007,  a  15  percent  increase  from  the  prior  quarter  and  a  three 
percent decrease from the 2006 first quarter.
Net earnings of $5.22 million for the 2007 first quarter were 26 percent below the $7.05 million of net earnings 
in the preceding quarter and 56 percent below the $11.92 million in the first quarter of 2006. The net earnings 
track the funds flow from operations for the respective periods modified by asset retirement expenditures and 
non-cash charges, which include depletion and depreciation, unrealized risk management gains/losses, future 
income taxes/recoveries and non-controlling interest. The primary reasons for the $6.70 million decrease in net 
earnings  when  comparing  first  quarter  2007  to  the  corresponding  2006  first  quarter  is  due  to  previously 
mentioned items such as increased unrealized risk management losses ($8.32 million), increased production 
costs  ($1.89  million),  increased  depletion  and  depreciation  expenses  ($1.35  million),  offset  by  realized  risk 
management gains ($3.69 million) and the corresponding net future tax recoveries pertaining to these items.

Net capital expenditures of $20.93 million in the first three months of 2007 were 38 percent higher than the 
first three months of 2006, reflecting an active field program of 17 gross (14.4 net) wells and increased well 
equipping  and  facility  costs.  Net  capital  expenditures  for  the  first  three  months  of  2007  were  allocated  to 
Alberta Plains – $7.87 million, West Central Alberta – $7.98 million and Williston Basin – $5.08 million. Drilling 
and completion expenses of $11.76 million were 38 percent higher than the prior year’s first quarter amount of 
$8.54 million. During the first quarter of 2007, 14.4 net wells were drilled compared to 33.4 net wells in the 
fourth quarter of 2006 and 13.2 net wells in the first quarter of 2006. Funds flow from operations in the 2007 
first three months of $21.80 million, proceeds from the exercise of trust unit rights of $0.95 million and the 
increase in bank debt of $7.64 million funded the capital program, the changes in working capital and the cash 
distributions to the unitholders. At March 31, 2007, the Trust continues to maintain a strong balance sheet with 
a combined debt net of working capital (excluding unrealized risk management assets and liabilities) of $47.18 
million, as compared to $39.83 million at the end of the 2006 fourth quarter, which represents slightly more 
than six months of the 2007 year-to-date annualized funds flow.
The  recently  announced  changes  to  the  Canadian  income  trust  tax  rules  after  2010  may  have  negatively 
impacted the Canadian oil and gas trust industry’s access to new capital from debt and equity markets in the 
near future. Zargon’s strategy of reinvesting approximately 50 percent of its funds flow from operations as well 
as  the  ability  to  access  its  recently  increased  revolving  credit  facilities  can  mitigate  the  potential  negative 
impact on capital markets of the recent tax announcement on Zargon’s sustainability strategies.
At May 11, 2007, Zargon Energy Trust had 16.972 million trust units and 2.120 million exchangeable shares 
outstanding. Assuming full conversion of exchangeable shares at the effective May 11, 2007 exchange ratio of 
1.22853, there would be 19.576 million trust units outstanding. Pursuant to the trust unit rights incentive plan 
there are currently an additional 1.193 million trust unit incentive rights issued and outstanding.

C H A N G E   I N   A C C O U N T I N G   P O L I C I E S
As  of  January  1,  2007,  the  Trust  adopted  CICA  Section  1530  “Comprehensive  Income”,  Section  3251 
“Equity”,  Section  3855  “Financial  Instruments  –  Recognition  and  Measurement”,  Section  3861  “Financial 
Instruments  –  Disclosure  and  Presentation”  and  Section  3865  “Hedges”.  Under  the  new  standards,  a  new 
statement,  the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Comprehensive  Income,  has  been  introduced  that  provides  for 
certain  gains  and  losses  arising  from  changes  in  fair  value,  to  be  temporarily  recorded  outside  the  income 
statements.    In  addition,  all  financial  instruments,  including  derivatives,  are  to  be  included  in  the  Trust’s 
Consolidated  Balance  Sheets  and  measured,  in  most  cases,  at  fair  values,  and  requirements  for  hedge 
accounting  have  been  further  clarified.    There  is  no  material  impact  to  the  Trust’s  consolidated  financial 
statement as a result of implementing the new standards.  As required by the new standards, prior periods 
have not been restated.
2007 FIRST QUARTER REPORT  11
As of January 1, 2007, the Trust adopted revised CICA Section 1506 “Accounting Changes”, which provides 
expanded  disclosures  for  changes  in  accounting  policies,  accounting  estimates  and  corrections  of  errors.  
Under the new standard, accounting changes should be applied retrospectively unless otherwise permitted or 
where  impracticable  to  determine.    As  well,  voluntary  changes  in  accounting  policy  are  made  only  when 
required by a primary source of GAAP or when the change results in more relevant and reliable information. 
There is no material impact to the Trust’s consolidated financial statements as a result of implementing this 
new standard.
For  a  detailed  discussion  about  the  accounting  policies  adopted  please  refer  to  Note  2  of  the  consolidated 
interim financial statements for the three month period ended March 31, 2007.
In addition, the Company has assessed new and revised accounting pronouncements that have been issued 
that are not yet effective and determined that the following may have a significant impact on the Trust:
On  December  1,  2006,  the  CICA  issued  three  new  accounting  standards:  CICA  Section  1535  “Capital 
Disclosures”,  CICA  Section  3862  “Financial  Instruments  –  Disclosures”  and  CICA  Section  3863  “Financial 
Instruments – Presentation”. These new standards are effective January 1, 2008.  Section 1535 specifies the 
disclosure of (i) an entity’s objectives, policies and processes for managing capital; (ii) quantitative data about 
what the entity regards as capital; (iii) whether the entity has complied with any capital requirements; and (iv) if 
it  has  not  complied,  the  consequences  of  such  non-compliance.  The  new  Sections  3862  and  3863  replace 
CICA  Section  3861  “Financial  Instruments  –  Disclosure  and  Presentation”,  revising  and  enhancing  its 
disclosure requirements, and carrying forward unchanged its presentation requirements. These new sections 
place increased emphasis on disclosures about the nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments 
and how the entity manages those risks. The Trust is currently assessing the impact of these new standards 
on its consolidated financial statements.
In January 2006, the CICA Accounting Standards Board (“AcSB”) adopted a strategic plan for the direction of 
accounting standards in Canada. As part of that plan, accounting standards in Canada for public companies are 
expected to converge with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) by the end of 2011. The Trust 
continues to monitor and assess the impact of convergence of Canadian GAAP and IFRS.
M A N A G E M E N T   A N D   F I N A N C I A L   R E P O R T I N G   S Y S T E M S
Zargon is required to comply with Multilateral Instrument 52-109 “Certification of Disclosure in Issuers’ Annual 
and Interim Filings”, otherwise referred to as Canadian SOX (“C-Sox”).  The 2007 certificate requires that the 
Trust  disclose  in  the  interim  MD&A  any  changes  in  the  Trust’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  that 
occurred during the period that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect the Trust’s 
internal control over financial reporting. The Trust confirms that no such changes were made to the internal 
controls over financial reporting during the first quarter of 2007.
Because  of  their  inherent  limitations,  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  and  internal  controls  over  financial 
reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements,  errors  or  fraud.    Control  systems,  no  matter  how  well 
conceived or operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control 
systems are met.
B U S I N E S S   R I S K S  
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION AND RISK 
 All  phases  of  the  oil  and  natural  gas  business  present  environmental  risks  and  hazards  and  are  subject  to 
environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of federal, provincial and local laws and regulations. In 2002, the 
Government  of  Canada  ratified  the  Kyoto  Protocol  (the  "Protocol"),  which  calls  for  Canada  to  reduce  its 
greenhouse gas emissions to specified levels. There has been much public debate with respect to Canada's 
ability to meet these targets and the Government's strategy or alternative strategies with respect to climate 
change and the control of greenhouse gases.
12
ZARGON ENERGY TRUST
Recently the Federal Government released its Action Plan to Reduce Greenhouse Gases and Air Pollution (the 
"Action Plan"), also known as ecoACTION which includes the Regulatory Framework for Air Emissions and the 
Alberta Government has also introduced legislation regarding greenhouse gas emissions.
Although Zargon is not a large emitter of greenhouse gases, the Trust continues to monitor developments in 
this area.  Although environmental legislation is evolving in a manner which could result in stricter standards 
and enforcement, larger fines and liability, and potentially increased capital expenditures and operating costs, at 
this  time  it  is  not  possible  to  predict  the  impact  of  these  requirements  on  the  Trust  and  its  operations  and 
financial condition. 
REVIEW OF ALBERTA ROYALTY AND TAX REGIME 
On  February  16,  2007,  the  Alberta  Government  announced  that  a  review  of  the  Province's  royalty  and  tax 
regime (including income tax and freehold mineral rights tax) pertaining to oil and gas resources, including oil 
sands,  conventional  oil  and  gas  and  coalbed  methane,  will  be  conducted  by  a  panel  of  experts,  with  the 
assistance of individual Albertans and key stakeholders. The review panel is to produce a final report that will 
be presented to the Minister of Finance by August 31, 2007.
O U T L O O K
With a strong balance sheet, 386 thousand net acres of undeveloped land and a promising internally generated 
project  inventory,  Zargon  continues  to  be  well  positioned  to  meet  its  objectives  as  a  sustainable  trust.  For 
2007, Zargon is forecasting an average production rate of 8,600 to 8,750 barrels of oil equivalent per day which 
is premised on a 2007 exploration and development capital program of $55 million. Consistent with its history, 
the Trust will adhere to a focused strategy of exploring and exploiting its existing asset base while executing 
value-added property acquisitions, which if available, would be funded by bank debt or equity issuances.

For the three months ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 (unaudited)
1.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
The interim unaudited consolidated financial statements of Zargon Energy Trust (the “Trust” or “Zargon”) have 
been  prepared  by  management  in  accordance  with  Canadian  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  The 
interim  unaudited  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  following  the  same  accounting 
policies  and  methods  in  computation  as  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  the  fiscal  year  ended 
December 31, 2006, except as noted below. The disclosures provided below are incremental to those included 
with  the  annual  audited  consolidated  financial  statements.  These  interim  unaudited  consolidated  financial 
statements do not include all disclosures required in the annual consolidated financial statements and should 
be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in the Zargon Energy Trust 
annual report for the year ended December 31, 2006.
The Trust’s principal business activity is the exploration for and development and production of petroleum and 
natural gas in Canada and the United States (“US”).
2.  CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
On January 1, 2007, the Trust adopted the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (“CICA”) Handbook 
Section  1530  “Comprehensive  Income”,  Section  3251  “Equity”,  Section  3855  “Financial  Instruments  – 
Recognition  and  Measurement”,  Section  3861  “Financial  Instruments  –  Disclosure  and  Presentation”  and 
Section 3865 “Hedges”. As required by the new standards, prior periods have not been restated.
The  adoption of  these  standards  has  had  no material  impact  on  the Trust's net  earnings or cash flows. The 
other effects of the implementation of the new standards are discussed below.
Comprehensive Income
The new standards introduce comprehensive income, which consists of net earnings and other comprehensive 
income (“OCI”). Upon adoption of Section 1530, the Trust revised its “Consolidated Statements of Earnings 
and Accumulated Earnings” to include the newly required statement of comprehensive income by creating a 
combined statement.
CICA  Section  1530  introduces  a  new  requirement  to  temporarily  present  certain  gains  and  losses  from 
changes  in  fair  value  outside  net  income.  It  includes  unrealized  gains  and  losses,  such  as:  changes  in  the 
currency  translation  adjustment  relating  to  self-sustaining  foreign  operations;  unrealized  gains  or  losses  on 
available-for-sale investments; and the effective portion of gains or losses on derivatives designated as cash 
flow hedges.
The  adoption  of  comprehensive  income  has  been  made  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  transitional 
provisions  and  no  amounts  have  been  reclassified  to  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income.  Currently, 
Zargon has no OCI.
Financial Instruments
The financial instruments standard establishes the recognition and measurement criteria for financial assets, 
financial liabilities and derivatives. All financial instruments are required to be measured at fair value on initial 
recognition  of  the  instrument,  except  for  certain  related  party  transactions.  Measurement  in  subsequent 
periods  depends  on  whether  the  financial  instrument  has  been  classified  as  "held-for-trading",  "available-for-
sale", "held-to-maturity", "loans and receivables", or "other financial liabilities" as defined by the standard.
Financial assets and financial liabilities "held-for-trading" are measured at fair value with changes in those fair 
values recognized in net earnings. Financial assets "available-for-sale" are measured at fair value, with changes 
in those fair values recognized in OCI until the asset is removed from the balance sheet. Financial assets "held-
to-maturity",  "loans  and  receivables"  and  "other  financial  liabilities"  are  measured  at  amortized  cost  using  the 
effective interest method of amortization. The methods used by the Trust in determining fair value of financial 
instruments are unchanged as a result of implementing the new standard.
18
ZARGON ENERGY TRUST
Accounts  receivable  is  designated  as  "loans  and  receivables".  Accounts  payable  and  accrued  liabilities,  cash 
distributions payable and long term debt are designated as "other liabilities".
The  adoption  of  the  financial  instruments  standard  has  been  made  in  accordance  with  its  transitional 
provisions. Accordingly, at January 1, 2007, $0.17 million of prepaid expenses and deposits were expensed to 
reflect the adopted policy of expensing long term debt transaction costs, premiums and discounts related to 
long term debt. Previously, the Trust deferred these costs within prepaid expenses and deposits and amortized 
them straight-line over the life of the related long term debt. The adoption of the expensing method had no 
effect on opening accumulated earnings.
Risk  management  assets  and  liabilities  are  derivative  financial  instruments  classified  as  "held-for-trading". 
Additional information on the Trust's accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments is contained in 
Note 2 of the Trust's annual audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006.
CICA  Section  3865  provides  alternative  treatments  to  Section  3855  for  entities  which  choose  to  designate 
qualifying transactions as hedges for accounting purposes. It replaces and expands on Accounting Guideline 13 
“Hedging  Relationships”,  and  the  hedging  guidance  in  Section  1650  “Foreign  Currency  Translation”  by 
specifying how hedge accounting is applied and what disclosures are necessary when it is applied. As Zargon 
currently uses mark-to-market accounting for its derivative financial instruments there is no material impact to 
the Trust’s consolidated financial statements as a result of implementing this new standard.
As of January 1, 2007, the Trust adopted revised CICA Section 1506 “Accounting Changes”, which provides 
expanded  disclosures  for  changes  in  accounting  policies,  accounting  estimates  and  corrections  of  errors.  
Under the new standard, accounting changes should be applied retrospectively unless otherwise permitted or 
where  impracticable  to  determine.    As  well,  voluntary  changes  in  accounting  policy  are  made  only  when 
required by a primary source of GAAP or when the change results in more relevant and reliable information. 
There is no material impact to the Trust’s consolidated financial statements as a result of implementing this 
new standard.
In addition, the Trust has assessed new and revised accounting pronouncements that have been issued that 
are not yet effective and determined that the following may have a significant impact on the Trust:
As  of  January  1,  2008,  Zargon  will  be  required  to  adopt  two  new  CICA  standards,  Section  3862  “Financial 
Instruments  –  Disclosures”  and  Section  3863  “Financial  Instruments  –  Presentation,”  which  will  replace 
Section 3861 “Financial Instruments – Disclosure and Presentation.” The new disclosure standard increases 
the emphasis on the risks associated with both recognized and unrecognized financial instruments and how 
those  risks  are  managed.  The  new  presentation  standard  carries  forward  the  former  presentation 
requirements.  The  new  financial  instruments  presentation  and  disclosure  requirements  were  issued  in 
December 2006 and the Trust is assessing the impact on its consolidated financial statements.
As  of  January  1,  2008,  Zargon  will  be  required  to  adopt  the  new  CICA  Section  1535  “Capital  Disclosures,” 
which  will  require  companies  to  disclose  their  objectives,  policies  and  processes  for  managing  capital.  In 
addition,  disclosures  are  to  include  whether  companies  have  complied  with  externally  imposed  capital 
requirements.  The  new  capital  disclosure  requirements  were  issued  in  December  2006  and  the  Trust  is 
assessing the impact on its consolidated financial statements.
3.  NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST – EXCHANGEABLE SHARES 
Zargon Oil & Gas Ltd. is authorized to issue an unlimited number of exchangeable shares. The exchangeable 
shares are convertible into trust units at the option of the shareholder, based on the exchange ratio, which is 
adjusted  monthly  to  reflect  the  distribution  paid  on  the  trust  units.  Cash  distributions  are  not  paid  on  the 
exchangeable  shares.  During  the  three  months  ended  March  31,  2007,  a  total  of  0.08  million  exchangeable 
shares were converted into 0.10 million trust units based on the exchange ratio at the time of conversion. At 
March 31, 2007, the exchange ratio was 1.22006 trust units per exchangeable share.

Per EIC-151 “Exchangeable Securities Issued by Subsidiaries of Income Trusts”, if certain conditions are met, 
the  exchangeable  shares  issued  by  a  subsidiary  must  be  reflected  as  non-controlling  interest  on  the 
consolidated  balance  sheets  and  in  turn,  net  earnings  must  be  reduced  by  the  amount  of  net  earnings 
attributed to the non-controlling interest.
The  non-controlling  interest  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  consists  of  the  book  value  of  exchangeable 
shares at the time of the Plan of Arrangement, plus net earnings attributable to the exchangeable shareholders, 
less  exchangeable  shares  (and  related  cumulative  earnings)  redeemed.  The  net  earnings  attributable  to  the 
non-controlling  interest  on  the  consolidated  statements  of  earnings  represents  the  cumulative  share  of  net 
earnings attributable to the non-controlling interest based on the trust units issuable for exchangeable shares in 
proportion to total trust units issued and issuable each period end.

The Trust has a unit rights incentive plan (the “Plan”) that allows the Trust to issue rights to acquire trust units 
to directors, officers, employees and service providers. The Trust is authorized to issue up to 2.36 million unit 
rights; however, the number of trust units reserved for issuance upon exercise of the rights shall not at any 
time exceed 10 percent of the aggregate number of the total outstanding units including units issuable upon 
exchange of exchangeable shares of Zargon and other fully paid securities of Zargon entities exchangeable into 
units  which  are  the  economic  equivalent  of  units  including  full  voting  rights.  At  the  time  of  grant,  unit  right 
exercise prices approximate the market price for the trust units. At the time of exercise, the rights holder has 
the  option  of  exercising  at  the  original  grant  price  or  the  exercise  price  as  calculated  per  the  Plan.  Rights 
granted  under  the  Plan  generally  vest  over  a  three-year  period  and  expire  approximately  five  years  from  the 
grant date. Zargon uses a fair value methodology to value the unit rights grants.
The weighted average assumptions made for unit rights granted for 2007 include a volatility factor of expected 
market  price  of  26.5  percent,  a  risk-free  interest  rate  of  3.9  percent,  a  dividend  yield  of  8.8  percent  and  an
2007 FIRST QUARTER REPORT  21
expected  life  of  the  unit  rights of  four  years.   These unit  rights,  together  with  the  continued  vesting  of  unit 
rights granted in prior years resulted in unit-based compensation expense for the three months ended March 
31, 2007 of $0.36 million (2006 - $0.32 million).
Compensation  expense  associated  with  rights  granted  under  the  Plan  is  recognized  in  earnings  over  the 
vesting period of the Plan with a corresponding increase in contributed surplus. The exercise of trust unit rights 
is  recorded  as an  increase  in  trust  units  with a  corresponding  reduction  in  contributed  surplus.  Forfeiture  of 
rights are recorded as a reduction in expense in the period in which they occur.

10.   RISK MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS 
The Trust is a party to certain financial instruments that have fixed the price of a portion of its oil and natural 
gas production. The Trust enters into these contracts for risk management purposes only, in order to protect a 
portion  of  its  future  cash  flow  from  the  volatility  of  oil  and  natural  gas  commodity  prices.  The  Trust  has 
outstanding financial contracts as follows:

Oil  swaps  are  settled  against  the  NYMEX  pricing  index,  whereas  natural  gas  swaps  are  settled  against  the 
AECO pricing index.
For financial risk management contracts, the Trust considers these contracts to be effective on an economic 
basis but has decided not to designate these contracts as hedges for accounting purposes and accordingly any 
unrealized gains or losses are recorded based on the fair value (mark-to-market) of the contracts at the period 
end. The unrealized loss for the first three months of 2007 was $5.84 million and the unrealized gain for the 
first three months of 2006 was $2.49 million.
