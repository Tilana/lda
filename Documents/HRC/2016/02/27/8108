<p><b>  The situation of indigenous peoples in the United States of America</b>*  **<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> In this report the Special Rapporteur examines the human rights situation of 
indigenous peoples in the United States, on the basis of research and information gathered, 
including during a visit to the country from 23 April to 4 May 2012. During his mission, 
the Special Rapporteur held consultations with United States officials as well as with 
indigenous peoples, tribes, and nations in Washington, D.C., Arizona, Alaska, Oregon, 
Washington state; South Dakota and Oklahoma, both in Indian country and in urban areas. 
Appendices I and II to this report include, respectively, summaries of information provided 
by the Government and of information submitted by indigenous peoples, organizations and 
individuals in connection with the mission. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur concludes that indigenous peoples in the United States &#8211; 
including American Indian, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian peoples &#8211; constitute 
vibrant communities that have contributed greatly to the life of the country; yet they face 
significant challenges that are related to widespread historical wrongs, including broken 
treaties and acts of oppression, and misguided government policies, that today manifest 
themselves in various indicators of disadvantage and impediments to the exercise of their 
individual and collective rights.

</p>
<p> Significant federal legislation and programmes that have been developed over the 
last few decades, in contrast to early exercises of federal power based on misguided 
policies, constitute good practices that in significant measure respond to indigenous 
peoples&#8217; concerns. Especially to be commended are the many new initiatives taken by the 
executive to advance the rights of indigenous peoples in the last few years.  
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur finds, however, that existing federal programmes need to be 
improved upon and their execution made more effective. Moreover, new measures are 
needed to advance toward reconciliation with indigenous peoples and address persistent 
deep-seated problems related to historical wrongs, failed policies of the past and continuing 
systemic barriers to the full realization of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights.  
</p>
<p> The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is an important 
impetus and guide for improving upon existing measures to address the concerns of 
indigenous peoples in the United States, and for developing new measures to advance 
toward reconciliation. The Declaration, which is grounded in widespread consensus and 
fundamental human rights values,  should be a benchmark for all relevant decision-making 
by the federal executive, Congress, and the judiciary, as well as by the states of the United 
States. The Special Rapporteur makes a series of recommendations in this regard. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the United States Government, 
especially the Department of State, for the cooperation it provided for the mission. He 
would also like to express his deep gratitude to representatives of indigenous peoples, 
nongovernmental organizations and academic institutions &#8211; named in appendix II&#8211; whose 
assistance in planning and carrying out of this visit was indispensible. The Special 
Rapporteur is grateful to the indigenous peoples that welcomed him into their communities 
and for the hospitality he received. Finally, the Special Rapporteur is grateful to the Office 
of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Support Project for the Special 
Rapporteur on Indigenous Peoples at the University of Arizona for their assistance in 
carrying out the mission and preparing this report.

<p><b>A/HRC/21/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. The indigenous peoples of the United States 
</b></p>
<p>1. The indigenous peoples of the United States include a vast array of distinct groups 
that fall under the generally accepted designation of Native Americans, which include 
American Indians and Alaska Natives; also included are the people indigenous to Hawaii, 
or Native Hawaiians. These indigenous peoples form tribes or nations &#8211; terms used 
interchangeably in this report &#8211; and other communities with distinctive cultural and 
political attributes.  
</p>
<p><b> A. The diverse indigenous nations, tribes and communities 
</b></p>
<p>2. Broadly speaking, Native Americans living in the contiguous United States 
constitute tribes or nations with diverse cultural and ethnic characteristics that can be 
grouped geographically. Linguistic families and other cultural markers, however, cross 
rough geographic categories, and within these categories differences abound. For historical 
and other reasons, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians are considered distinct from 
Native Americans in the contiguous United States.  
</p>
<p>3. The United States presently recognizes and maintains what it refers to as 
government-to-government relations with approximately 566 American Indian and Alaska 
Native tribes and villages, around 230 of these being Alaskan Native groups. For the most 
part each of these tribes and villages determines its own membership. While having some 
form of federal recognition, Native Hawaiians do not have a similar status under United 
States law as that of American Indians and Alaska Native groups. Many other groups in the 
United States that identify as indigenous peoples have not been federally recognized, 
although some of these have achieved recognition at the state level.  
</p>
<p>4. It is estimated that prior to colonization, the indigenous population within the 
territory that now constitutes the United States numbered several million, and represented 
diverse cultures and societies speaking hundreds of languages and dialects. After the arrival 
of Europeans, the indigenous population suffered significant decline due to the effects of 
disease, war, enslavement and forced relocations.  
</p>
<p>5. Today, according to United States census data people who identify as Native 
American represent approximately 1.7 per cent of the overall population of the United 
States, with 5.2 million persons identifying as American Indian or Alaska Native, either 
alone or in combination with one or more other races.1 It should be noted that this number 
significantly exceeds the number of those who are enrolled or registered members of 
federally recognized indigenous groups. In addition, there are roughly a half a million 
persons that identify entirely or partly as Native Hawaiians.    
</p>
<p>6. Characteristically, the federally recognized tribes have reservations or other lands 
that have been left to or set aside for them, and over which they exercise powers of self-
government. While the land holdings vary significantly among the tribes, in all cases they 
pale in comparison to the land areas once under their possession or control. Still, the 
diminished landholdings provide some physical space and material bases for the tribes to 
maintain their cultures and political institutions, and to develop economically.  
</p>
<p>7. While many indigenous persons live on reservations or other Native-controlled land 
areas, many others live in urban areas beyond the boundaries of indigenous lands. It is quite 
common, however, for indigenous persons living in urban areas to maintain close ties to the 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>land-based communities of the tribes with which they are affiliated, and to develop bonds 
of community with other indigenous persons in their urban settings. 
</p>
<p>8. Several indigenous peoples live in border areas and face unique challenges, 
especially tribes living along the United States-Mexico border, where heightened border 
security measures implemented by the federal Government in recent years have 
increasingly made cross-border contact between members of the same tribes very difficult. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The contributions of indigenous peoples to the broader society, despite 
</b></p>
<p><b>negative stereotypes 
</b></p>
<p>9. Within the United States stereotypes persist that tend to render Native Americans 
relics of the past, perpetuated by the use of Indian names by professional and other high-
profile sports teams, caricatures in the popular media and even mainstream education on 
history and social studies. Throughout his mission, the Special Rapporteur heard complaints 
from indigenous representatives about such stereotypes, and about how they obscure 
understanding of the reality of Native Americans today and instead help to keep alive 
racially discriminatory attitudes. 
</p>
<p>10. Beyond the stereotypes, one readily sees vibrant indigenous communities, both in 
reservation and other areas, including urban areas, which have contributed to the building 
of the country and continue to contribute to the broader society. Of course their greatest 
contribution is in the vast expanses of land that they gave up, through treaty cessions and 
otherwise, without which the United States and its economic base would not exist. Native 
Americans have also added to the defence and security of the United States and are 
represented among the ranks of the United States military services at a rate higher than that 
of any other ethnic group. 
</p>
<p>11. Today, indigenous peoples in the United States face multiple disadvantages, which 
are related to the long history of wrongs and misguided policies that have been inflicted 
upon them. Nonetheless, American Indians, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians have 
survived as peoples, striving to develop with their distinct identities intact, and to maintain 
and transmit to future generations their material and cultural heritage. While doing so, they 
add a cultural depth and grounding that, even while often going unnoticed by the majority 
society, is an important part of the country&#8217;s collective heritage. Further, the knowledge 
</p>
<p>that they retain about the country&#8217;s landscapes and the natural resources on them, along 
with their ethic of stewardship of the land, are invaluable assets to the country, even if not 
fully appreciated.  
</p>
<p><b> II. United States law and policy regarding indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>12. Laws and policies related to indigenous peoples have developed over centuries since 
the colonial era, and today they comprise a complex array of decisions by the United States 
Congress, the executive branch of the federal Government and the federal courts, in 
particular the United States Supreme Court.  
</p>
<p><b> A. The basic framework  
</b></p>
<p>13. The Constitution of the United States (1787) makes little reference to indigenous 
peoples, the principal mention being in its article I, section 8, which provides Congress the 
power to &#8220;regulate commerce with &#8230;with the Indian Tribes.&#8221; This provision signals that, 
within the federal structure of government of the United States, competency over matters 
relating to indigenous peoples rests at the federal, as opposed to state, level.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>14. Looking beyond the constitutional text to historical practice, the colonial era law of 
nations and reason, the United States Supreme Court established, in a series of early 19th 
century cases, foundational principles about the rights and status of Indian tribes that 
largely endure today. Supreme Court doctrine recognizes that Indian tribes are inherently 
sovereign with powers of self-government; indeed they are &#8220;nations&#8221; with original rights 
over their ancestral lands. Within this same body of doctrine, however, the sovereignty and 
original land rights of tribes are deemed necessarily diminished and subordinated to the 
power of United States, as a result of discovery or conquest by the European colonial 
powers or the successor United States.  
</p>
<p>15. The federal power to regulate commerce with the Indian tribes is thereby enlarged to 
one that is deemed plenary in nature and that can be used to unilaterally modify or 
extinguish tribal sovereignty or land rights. This power is also related to and justified by a 
duty of protection the federal Government is deemed to have over Indian tribes, in a so-
called trusteeship. In all, tribes are sovereign nations with certain inherent powers of self-
government and original rights, but they are rendered, in words penned by the famous 
Supreme Court Justice John Marshall, &#8220;domestic dependent nations,&#8221; subject to the 
</p>
<p>overriding power of the federal Government.  
</p>
<p>16. While acknowledging positive characteristics of the rights-affirming strain of this 
judicial doctrine, the Special Rapporteur notes that the rights-limiting strain of this doctrine 
is out of step with contemporary human rights values. As demonstrated by a significant 
body of scholarly work, the use of notions of discovery and conquest to find Indians rights 
diminished and subordinated to plenary congressional power is linked to colonial era 
attitudes toward indigenous peoples that can only be described as racist. Early Supreme 
Court decisions themselves reveal perceptions of Indians as backward, conquered peoples, 
with descriptions of them as savages and an inferior race.   
</p>
<p>17. At times, however, the Supreme Court and lower courts have been protective of 
indigenous peoples&#8217; rights by affirming original Indian rights to the extent consistent with 
</p>
<p>operative doctrine, or more often by enforcing treaty terms, legislation, or executive 
decisions that are themselves protective of indigenous rights.  
</p>
<p><b> B. The evolution of federal policy and legislation 
</b></p>
<p>18.  Federal legislative and executive action, in the exercise of the broad authority over 
indigenous affairs affirmed by the Supreme Court, has evolved over time along with 
shifting policy objectives shaped by historical circumstances and prevailing attitudes of the 
time.   
</p>
<p>19. After achieving its independence, the United States continued the practice that had 
been established by Great Britain and other colonial powers of treaty-making with Indian 
tribes. These treaties were means both by which the United States or its colonial precursors 
acquired land from Indian tribes, as well as means by which the tribes retained rights over 
lands and resources not ceded. The treaties, moreover, dealt with diverse issues and 
provided a foundation for the United States&#8217; relations with tribes on the basis of their 
recognition as nations with inherent sovereignty.   
</p>
<p>20. Although the United States ceased dealing with Indian tribes through treaties in 
1871, after having consolidated its control over the territory it had acquired across the 
continent, many of the historical treaties with tribes continue in force as part of federal law 
and to define United States-tribal relations. At the same time, numerous flagrant violations 
of historical treaties constitute some of the principal wrongdoings committed by the United 
States towards indigenous peoples, which was a recurring subject of concern raised to the 
Special Rapporteur during his visit. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>21. Subsequent to the end of the treaty-making era, United States law and policy was 
characterized by a series of steps aimed at acculturating indigenous peoples in the ways of 
the dominant society and diluting or eliminating their sovereignty and collective rights over 
lands and resources. In the late nineteenth century, a vast government bureaucracy emerged 
under a United States Commissioner of Indian Affairs to consolidate and manage the 
system of reservations, pueblos, rancherias and settlements that were home to the surviving 
indigenous peoples in the country.  
</p>
<p>22. Under the Dawes General Allotment Act of 1887, tribal landholdings were broken 
up into individual plots that could become alienable, which eventually resulted in a 
substantial further loss of Indian land and a complex system of interspersed Indian and non-
Indian titled land that now characterizes tenure within many reservations. The Dawes Act 
resulted in even greater impoverishment and social upheaval among the tribes, and thus, 
after conferring United States citizenship on all Indians in 1924, Congress passed the Indian 
Reorganization Act  of 1934 as a major reform measure.   
</p>
<p>23. The Indian Reorganization Act included provisions to secure the Indian land base 
from further erosion and provided for establishing reservation-based governments akin to 
local municipalities under the authority of the Secretary of Interior of the federal 
Government, on the basis of model constitutions that were developed by the Secretary. 
While providing a degree of self-government, the Act was considered a transitional 
measure to prepare the Indians for, in the words of its chief architect, United States Indian 
Commissioner John Collier, &#8220;real assimilation.&#8221;2 Many Indian tribes today continue under 
the IRA regime. 
</p>
<p>24. In the 1950s the United States Government attempted to complete its programme of 
assimilation with Congress&#8217;s adoption of a formal policy of &#8220;termination,&#8221;3 which involved 
steps to end the special status of Indian tribes and convert their lands to private ownership. 
The termination policy was eventually abandoned, but not before several tribes lost federal 
recognition and their self-governing status, and saw their landholdings dissipate, with 
invariably devastating social and economic consequences that are still apparent today.  
</p>
<p><b> C. The contemporary federal legislative and policy regime 
</b></p>
<p>25. In the face of past federal programmes of assimilation and acculturation, Native 
Americans continued to make clear their determination, as they still do, to hold on to and 
recover their own distinctive cultures and institutions of self-government as a basis for their 
development and place in the world. With this resolve eventually came a change in federal 
policy, as it moved to reflect, if not entirely accommodate, indigenous peoples&#8217; own 
</p>
<p>aspirations. In 1970, the President of the United States advanced this change in a message 
to Congress, in which he affirmed, &#8220;The time has come to break decisively with the past 
</p>
<p>and to create the conditions for a new era in which the Indian future is determined by Indian 
Acts and Indian decisions.&#8221;4   
</p>
<p>26. The contemporary thrust of federal policy is marked by several pieces of major 
legislation, including the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, 
by which tribes are able to assume the planning and administration of federal programmes 
that are devised for their benefit; the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, which favours 
indigenous custody of indigenous children; the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of

<p>1978, which directs federal officials to consult with tribes about actions that may affect 
religious practices; the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990, 
which directs federal agencies and museums to return indigenous remains and sacred 
objects to appropriate indigenous groups; and the Native American Languages Act of 1990, 
which provides support for the use and recovery of indigenous languages through 
educational programmes. A number of other laws provide protections for indigenous 
religion and culture, and still others address Indian economic and natural resource 
development, education and civil rights.  
</p>
<p>27. In alignment with the existing federal legislation, there are dozens of executive 
directives and programmes that apply specifically to indigenous peoples, many of which are 
listed in appendix I, and that reflect a significant level of dedication on the part of the 
Government to indigenous concerns within the self-determination policy framework.  
</p>
<p>28. Several agencies throughout the Government are dedicated specifically to 
indigenous affairs, the principal one being the Department of Interior, which includes the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs. Under federal law, pursuant to its historical protectorate, or 
trusteeship, the United States holds in trust the underlying title to the Indian lands within 
reservations and other lands set aside by statute or treaty for the tribes. The Department is 
responsible for overseeing some 55 million surface acres and the subsurface mineral 
resources in some 57 million acres.  
</p>
<p>29. There are numerous other indigenous-specific agencies and programmes in various 
parts of the Government. Notably, and especially in recent years, the Government has made 
an important, increased effort to appoint indigenous individuals to high-level government 
positions dealing with indigenous affairs, including the position of Assistant Secretary for 
Indian Affairs, which heads the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Also significantly, in 2009, the 
position of Senior Policy Advisor for Native American Affairs was created to advise the 
President on issues related to indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p><b> III. The disadvantaged conditions of indigenous peoples: The 
present day legacies of historical wrongs 
</b></p>
<p>30. United States laws and policies in the last few decades undoubtedly have contributed 
to halting the erosion of indigenous identities, and have weighed in favour of placing 
indigenous peoples on a path toward greater self-determination, as well as economic and 
social health. Nonetheless, the conditions of disadvantage persist with the continuing 
effects of a long history of wrongs and past, misguided policies. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Economic and social conditions 
</b></p>
<p>31. At the close of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mission to the United States, he received a 
manila envelope stuffed with letters written by students from a class at White River High 
School in South Dakota, a school where a majority of the students are from the nearby 
reservation of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe. In a cover letter the class&#8217;s teacher explained that 
</p>
<p>the students &#8220;would like to feel they have a voice as it is so desolate here that it is 
sometimes hard to remember there is an outside world. Despite all the hardships here, these 
kids are so incredibly resilient and talented.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>32. The teacher&#8217;s words were a poignant introduction to the first letter in the stack, 
which was from a 15-year-old girl who lamented: 
</p>
<p>Life here is very hand to mouth. Out here, we don&#8217;t have the finer things. You get 
</p>
<p>what you get and you don&#8217;t throw a fit. And I&#8217;m going to be honest with you, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>sometimes I don&#8217;t eat. I&#8217;ve never told anyone this before, not even my mom, but I 
don&#8217;t eat sometimes because I feel bad about making my mom buy food that I know 
</p>
<p>is expensive. And you know what? Life is hard enough for my mom, so I will 
probably never tell her. My parents have enough to worry about. I do not know what 
you can do, but try your very best to help us. Please help us. We can do this. Yes we 
can! 
</p>
<p>33. The evident hardship combined with resilience was reflected in the other letters, 
giving a highly personalized gloss on the conditions of disadvantage faced by indigenous 
peoples in the United States. These conditions vary widely among the diverse indigenous 
tribes, nations and communities. United States census data and other available statistics, 
however, show Native Americans to fare much worse along social and economic indicators 
than any other ethnic group in the country.  
</p>
<p>34. For example, Native Americans, especially on reservations, have disproportionately 
high poverty rates, rising to nearly double the national average.5 Along with poverty, Native 
Americans suffer poor health conditions, with low life expectancy and high rates of disease, 
illness, alcoholism and suicide.6 As for education, 77 per cent of Native Americans aged 25 
or older hold a high school diploma or alternative credential as compared with 86 per cent 
of the general population, while 13 per cent of Native Americans hold a basic university 
degree as compared to 28 per cent of the general population.7 Indigenous peoples also face 
disproportionate rates of incarceration, and rates of violent crime on Indian reservations 
exceed those of any other racial group and are double the national average.8  
</p>
<p>35. The image now often popularized of Native Americans flush with cash from casinos 
is far from the norm. A number of tribes do have casino operations as part of economic 
development efforts, taking advantage of special exemptions from ordinary state regulation 
and taxation that are available to them under federal law. Most tribes, however, do not have 
casinos and, of those that do, only a handful have reaped substantial riches sufficient to 
significantly reduce poverty levels. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>36. The continuing vulnerabilities of indigenous communities are highlighted by 
alarmingly high rates of violence against indigenous women, a grave and persistent 
problem that has been well documented.9 The United States Department of Justice 
estimates that indigenous women are more than twice as likely as all other women to be 
victims of violence10 and that one in three of them will be raped during her lifetime.11

<p>Estimates are that nearly 80 per cent of the rapes of indigenous women are by non-
indigenous men, many of who have made their way into indigenous communities but who 
are not presently subject to indigenous prosecutorial authority because of their non-
indigenous status. Congress has yet to pass key reforms in the Violence Against Women 
Act that would bolster tribes&#8217; ability to prosecute these cases. In order to get away from 
</p>
<p>violent situations, many victims are forced to leave their homes and communities, which is 
particularly troubling in the context of indigenous peoples. As one Tinglit woman 
expressed, &#8220;when I left, I didn&#8217;t just leave my family. I left my culture behind&#8230; I ran away 
</p>
<p>from my traditions, from my songs, my dances, and my heritage.&#8221;  
</p>
<p><b> C. Lands, resources and broken treaties 
</b></p>
<p>37. The conditions of disadvantage of indigenous peoples undoubtedly are not mere 
happenstance. Rather, they stem from the well-documented history of the taking of vast 
expanses of indigenous lands with abundant resources, along with active suppression of 
indigenous peoples&#8217; culture and political institutions, entrenched patterns of discrimination 
against them and outright brutality, all of which figured in the history of the settlement of 
the country and the building of its economy.  
</p>
<p>38. Many Indian nations conveyed land to the United States or its colonial predecessors 
by treaty, but almost invariably under coercion following warfare or threat thereof, and in 
exchange usually for little more than promises of government assistance and protection that 
usually proved illusory or worse. In other cases, lands were simply taken by force or fraud. 
In many instances treaty provisions that guaranteed reserved rights to tribes over lands or 
resources were broken by the United States, under pressure to acquire land for non-
indigenous interests. It is a testament to the goodwill of Indian nations that they have 
uniformly insisted on observance of the treaties, even regarding them as sacred compacts, 
rather than challenge their terms as inequitable.  
</p>
<p>39. In nearly all cases the loss of land meant the substantial or complete undermining of 
indigenous peoples&#8217; own economic foundations and means of subsistence, as well as 
</p>
<p>cultural loss, given the centrality of land to cultural and related social patterns. Especially 
devastating instances of such loss involve the forced removal of indigenous peoples from 
their ancestral territories, as happened for example, with the Choctaw, Cherokee and other 
indigenous people who were removed from their homes in the south-eastern United States 
to the Oklahoma territory in a trek through what has been called a &#8220;trail of tears,&#8221; in which 
many of them perished.  
</p>
<p>40. Another emblematic case involves the Black Hills in South Dakota, part of the 
ancestral territory of the Lakota people that, under the Treaty of Fort Laramie of 1868, was 
reserved to the Lakota and other tribes known collectively as the Sioux Nation. Following 
the discovery of gold in the area, in 1877 Congress passed an act reversing its promise 
under the treaty and vesting ownership of the Black Hills to the Government. The Lakota 
and other Sioux tribes have refused to accept payment required in accordance with a 1980 
Supreme Court decision and continue to request the return of the Black Hills; this is despite 
the fact that the people of these tribes are now scattered on several reservations and are 
some of the poorest among any group in the country. Today, the Black Hills are national 
forest and park lands, although they still hold a central place in the history, culture, and 
worldviews of surrounding tribes and at the same time serve as a constant visible reminder 
of their loss.

<p><b>A/HRC/21/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>41. In addition to millions of acres of lands lost, often in violation of treaties, a history 
of inadequately controlled extractive and other activities within or near remaining 
indigenous lands, including nuclear weapons testing and uranium mining in the western 
United States, has resulted in widespread environmental harm, and has caused serious and 
continued health problems among Native Americans. During his visit, the Special 
Rapporteur also heard concerns about several currently proposed projects that could 
potentially cause environmental harm to indigenous habitats, including the Keystone XL 
pipeline and the Pebble Mine project in Alaska&#8217;s Bristol Bay watershed. By all accounts the 
Pebble Mine would seriously threaten the sockeye salmon fisheries in the area if developed 
according to current plans.  
</p>
<p>42. In many places, including in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest in particular, 
indigenous peoples continue to depend upon hunting and fishing, and the maintenance of 
these subsistence activities is essential for both their physical and their cultural survival, 
especially in isolated areas. However, indigenous peoples face ever-greater threats to their 
subsistence activities due to a growing surge of competing activities, restrictive state and 
federal regulatory regimes, and environmental harm.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Sacred places 
</b></p>
<p>43. With their loss of land, indigenous peoples have lost control over places of cultural 
and religious significance. Particular sites and geographic spaces that are sacred to 
indigenous peoples can be found throughout the vast expanse of lands that have passed into 
government hands. The ability of indigenous peoples to use and access their sacred places 
is often curtailed by mining, logging, hydroelectric and other development projects, which 
are carried out under permits issued by federal or state authorities. In many cases, the very 
presence of these activities represents a desecration.  
</p>
<p>44. A case that has been reviewed in detail by the Special Rapporteur involves the San 
Francisco Peaks in Northern Arizona, an area sacred to the Navajo, Hopi and other 
indigenous peoples, where under a federal permit the Snowbowl ski resort plans to make 
artificial snow using recycled sewage effluent.12 Numerous other examples brought to the 
attention of the Special Rapporteur can be found in appendix II. The desecration and lack of 
access to sacred places inflicts permanent harm on indigenous peoples for whom these 
places are essential parts of identity.  
</p>
<p><b> E. The removal of children from indigenous environments 
</b></p>
<p>45. Historically, added to the taking of indigenous lands was the direct assault on 
indigenous cultural expression that was carried out or facilitated by the federal and state 
governments. Likely the programme of this type with the most devastating consequences, 
which are still felt today, was the systematic removal of indigenous children from their 
families to place them in government or church-run boarding schools, with the objective of 
expunging them of their indigenous identities. Captain Richard Pratt, founder of the 
Carlisle Indian school, coined the phrase, &#8220;kill the Indian in him, save the man,&#8221; in 
instituting the boarding school policy in the 1880s which continued well into the mid 
1900s.  
</p>
<p>46. Emotional, physical, and sexual abuse within the boarding schools has been well-
documented. Typically, upon entering a boarding school, indigenous children had their hair 
</p>
<p>  
 12 A/HRC/18/35.Add.1, Annex X, and A/HRC/19/44. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>cut, were forced to wear uniforms and were punished for speaking their languages or 
practising their traditions. The compounded effect of generations of indigenous people, 
including generations still living, having passed through these schools cuts deep in 
indigenous communities throughout the United States, where social problems such as 
alcoholism and sexual abuse are now pervasive and loss of language is widespread.  
</p>
<p>47. Additionally, a pattern of placing indigenous children in non-indigenous care under 
state custody proceedings, with similar effects on indigenous individuals and communities, 
continued until well into the 1970s, only to be blunted by passage of the Indian Child 
Welfare Act in 1978, federal legislation that advances a strong presumption of indigenous 
custody for indigenous children but that continues to face barriers to its implementation. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Open wounds of historical events 
</b></p>
<p>48. The open wounds left by historical events are plentiful, alive in intergenerational 
memory if not experience. The Special Rapporteur heard emotional testimony from a direct 
descendant of victims of one of the most well-known atrocities committed against Native 
Americans, the massacre at Sand Creek in 1864. Scores of Cheyenne and Arapaho were 
attacked by surprise and massacred by some 700 armed United States troops. Previously, 
the tribes had signed a treaty with the United States, under which they willingly gave up 
their arms and flew a flag of truce at the Sand Creek camp. No action was ever taken 
against those responsible for the massacre and, despite the promises made in a later treaty 
of reparations for the descendants of the victims at Sand Creek, none has yet been made.  
</p>
<p>49. A more recent incident that continues to spark feelings of injustice among 
indigenous peoples around the United States is the well-known case of Leonard Peltier, an 
activist and leader in the American Indian Movement, who was convicted in 1977 
following the deaths of two Federal Bureau of Investigation agents during a clash on the 
Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. After a trial that has been criticized by many as 
involving numerous due process problems, Mr. Peltier was sentenced to two life sentences 
for murder, and has been denied parole on various occasions. Pleas for presidential 
consideration of clemency by notable individuals and institutions have not borne fruit. This 
further depletes the already diminished faith in the criminal justice system felt by many 
indigenous peoples throughout the country. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Self-government 
</b></p>
<p>50. Many indigenous representatives in all the locations visited by the Special 
Rapporteur stressed the importance to the health and well-being of their peoples of securing 
and recovering the various expressions and practices of their cultures, including indigenous 
languages, and of being able to transmit their cultures and identities to future generations, 
along with securing ties to land and natural resources and enhancing self-government 
capacity.  
</p>
<p>51. As noted in paragraphs 25-29 and in appendix I, several government programmes 
are in place to address the concerns of indigenous peoples and to provide them substantial 
assistance. Indigenous leaders stressed to the Special Rapporteur, however, that the solution 
lies fundamentally in further strengthening indigenous peoples&#8217; ability to develop and 
implement their own programmes for economic development and job creation, education, 
preservation and development of cultural expressions and knowledge, and public order, 
including the protection of indigenous women and children.  
</p>
<p>52. Yet, the government policy of indigenous self-determination in place for several 
decades has not abated problematic restrictions that have been imposed on indigenous </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>peoples&#8217; self-government. As a general matter, the sovereignty of federally-recognized 
Indian tribes, as far as it goes, displaces the authority of the states over so-called Indian 
country, that is, reservation and other lands under Indian control. But United States courts 
have continued to see the inherent sovereignty of tribes, and hence their self-governance 
authority, as an implicitly diminished sovereignty, and this view has served to limit the 
powers of tribal regulatory and judicial authorities especially in relation to non-indigenous 
persons. Additionally, tribal sovereignty may succumb to substantial state sovereignty 
interests,13 and the Supreme Court has restrictively interpreted the Indian Reorganization 
Act to prevent many tribes from extending their sovereignty over recovered or newly 
acquired lands.14  
</p>
<p>53. Judicially-established limitations on tribal sovereignty are in addition to those 
imposed by Congress, especially under acts devised under the earlier eras of assimilation. 
These include the Major Crimes Act of 1885, which established paramount federal 
jurisdiction over certain crimes committed in Indian country, whether by an indigenous or 
non-indigenous person; and Public Law 280 of 1953, which extended state criminal and 
civil jurisdiction to Indian country in specified states.  
</p>
<p>54. Especially in light of inadequate state and federal law enforcement on reservations, 
these jurisdictional limits imposed on indigenous tribes result in situations in which, as one 
tribal judge lamented, &#8220;we can&#8217;t police and punish people who come into the community 
</p>
<p>and cause harm to that community and its people.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur also heard 
numerous frustrations based on concerns that jurisdictional limitations send the constant 
message to tribes that their institutions are incompetent and inferior, no matter how capable 
they have demonstrated themselves to be. Further impeding self-governance capacity are 
financial constraints. 
</p>
<p>55. It is important to note, however, that despite these impediments, many tribal 
governments and justice systems are gaining strength, and the Special Rapporteur was 
impressed by the determination of tribes to continue build their governance institutions. 
During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s consultation in Oklahoma, the Principal Chief of the 
Cherokee Nation put it this way: &#8220;As the Principal Chief of the largest Indian Tribe in the 
United States, my vision for our people is one of becoming great.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b> H. Recognition 
</b></p>
<p>56. In order for its powers of sovereignty, or self-government, to be recognized and 
officially functional within the United States legal system, or to be eligible for assistance 
designated for Indian tribes, an indigenous group must have specific recognition by the 
federal Government. A number of indigenous peoples, for reasons related to the same 
cluster of historical events that have broadly affected indigenous peoples in the country, 
lack such federal recognition and hence are especially disadvantaged. Several of these are 
tribes that were stripped of their federal status as a result of the termination policies of the 
1950s.  
</p>
<p>57. Unrecognized indigenous groups have been striving to achieve federal recognition 
for decades, principally through an administrative process provided for this purpose by the 
Department of the Interior. Concerns regarding the cost and the length of the federal 
recognition process, and the challenges faced by lack of recognition, were repeatedly 
brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur. Indigenous groups have invested 
</p>
<p>  
 13 See Nevada v. Hicks, 533 U.S. 353 (2001). 
 14 See Carcieri v. Salazar, 129 S.Ct. 1058 (2009). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>millions of dollars and filed thousands of documents in support of their claims. Figures 
about the pace of the recognition process yield differing perspectives. Nonetheless, as 
described by one Senator &#8220;it is not a system that is working under any stretch of the 
</p>
<p>imagination.&#8221;  
</p>
<p><b> I. Alaska 
</b></p>
<p>58. Indigenous peoples in Alaska have federal recognition within a unique legal regime 
that developed under a specific set of circumstances. In 1971 Congress enacted the Alaska 
Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), which extinguished &#8220;all claims of aboriginal 
</p>
<p>title,&#8221; as well as &#8220;any aboriginal hunting and fishing rights that may exist,&#8221; throughout 
</p>
<p>Alaska. The act set up a system of native-run corporations with assets provided under the 
settlement, and Alaska Natives born as of the date of the act were given shares in the 
corporations. 
</p>
<p>59. With its design of replacing rights in land and resources with individual shares in 
corporations, ANCSA can be seen as being driven by the policy of assimilation that had 
long been in place and that presumably was coming to an end around the time of the act&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>adoption (see paras. 21-24 above). Yet ANCSA continues to define realities for indigenous 
peoples in Alaska, leaving in its aftermath precarious conditions for indigenous peoples in 
their ability to maintain the subsistence and cultural patterns that have long sustained them 
amid abundant fish and wildlife resources, or to craft their own vehicles of self-
determination.  
</p>
<p>60. Subsequent federal legislation has done little to restore Alaska Native hunting and 
fishing rights, but instead has left indigenous hunting and fishing subject to the same 
regulatory regime that applies to non-indigenous activities. And this regulatory regime is a 
highly complex, difficult one to navigate, in which both the federal Government and the 
state play a part, with the state in effect having a dominant role. The matter of subsistence 
hunting and fishing remains crucial both for cultural purposes and for food security. 
However, subsistence activities are subject to a state regulatory regime that allows for, and 
appears to often favour, competing land and resource uses such as mining and other 
activities, including hunting and fishing for sport, that may threaten natural environments 
and food sources.  
</p>
<p>61. Representatives of Alaska Native tribal governments, villages, corporations and 
organizations with whom the Special Rapporteur met coincided in the view that ANCSA 
was faulty in its inception. There were divergent views, however, about the extent to which 
the corporations can and are being responsive to the needs and aspirations of Alaska 
Natives, within the limitations of the corporate model. The Special Rapporteur did find 
indications that in many respects the native-run corporations are functioning to provide 
important economic and other benefits to Alaska Natives. 
</p>
<p>62. At the same time, the Special Rapporteur was struck by indications about how the 
economic and cultural transformations accelerated by ANCSA have bred or exacerbated 
social ills among indigenous communities, manifesting themselves, for example, in high 
rates of suicide, alcoholism, and violence. 
</p>
<p>63. Several Alaska Native representatives expressed to the Special Rapporteur the view 
that the problem runs deeper than ANCSA, to the incorporation of Alaska into the United 
States as a federal state through procedures that allegedly were not in compliance with the 
right of the indigenous people of Alaska to self-determination.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p><b> J. Hawaii 
</b></p>
<p>64. Also uniquely vulnerable are the indigenous people of Hawaii, having experienced a 
particular history of colonial onslaught and resulting economic, social and cultural 
upheaval.  They benefit from some federal programmes available to Native Americans, but 
they have no recognized powers of self-government under federal law.  And they have little 
by way of effective landholdings, their lands largely having passed to non-indigenous 
ownership and control with the aggressive patterns of colonization initiated with the arrival 
of the British explorer James Cook in 1778. Indigenous Hawaiians have diffuse interests in 
lands &#8220;ceded&#8217; to the United States and then passed to the state of Hawaii, under a trust that 
is specified in the 1959 Statehood Admission Act and now managed by the Office of 
Hawaiian Affairs.  
</p>
<p>65. Remarkably, the United States Congress in 1993 issued an apology &#8220;to Native 
Hawaiians on behalf of the people of the United States for the overthrow of the Kingdom of 
Hawaii on January 17, 1893 with the participation of agents and citizens of the United 
States.&#8221;15 The apology recognized that the overthrow resulted in the suppression of the 
&#8220;inherent sovereignty of the Native Hawaiian people&#8221; and called for &#8220;reconciliation&#8221; 
</p>
<p>efforts.   
</p>
<p>66. The call for reconciliation, however, remains unfilled, while a growing movement of 
indigenous Hawaiians challenges the legitimacy and legality of the annexation of Hawaii 
following the overthrow, as well as the process by which Hawaii moved from its 
designation as a non-self-governing territory under United Nations supervision, to being 
incorporated into the United States as one of its federal states in 1959. In the meantime, 
indigenous Hawaiians see their sacred places under the domination of others, and they 
continue to fare worse than any other demographic group in Hawaii in terms of education, 
health, crime, and employment.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. More needs to be done 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Welcomed, but still not sufficient, government initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the high level of attention to indigenous 
peoples&#8217; concerns that is represented by numerous acts of Congress and federal executive 
</p>
<p>programmes (see paras. 25-29 above and appendix I). Such attention represents some 
acknowledgment of the historical debt acquired toward the country&#8217;s first peoples, and 
</p>
<p>partially fulfils historical treaty commitments.  
</p>
<p>68. It is evident that the federal executive has taken steps in recent years to strengthen 
these programmes, in addition to its new initiatives to develop consultation policies and 
open spaces of dialogue with tribes; to strengthen support for the recovery of indigenous 
languages; to settle outstanding claims for mismanagement indigenous assets held in trust 
by the Government; to increase funding for federal programmes; to address the problem of 
violence against indigenous women; to clean up environmental pollution caused by natural 
resource extraction; to assist tribes with acquiring land to restore their land bases; and to 
enhance tribal capacity and cooperative arrangements in the area of law and order, among 
others. 
</p>
<p>  
 15 Public Law 103-150, 103d Congress Joint Resolution 19 (1993). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur notes however, concerns that were raised with him about the 
adequacy of effective implementation of the highly developed body of law and government 
programmes concerning indigenous peoples. While welcoming improved consultation 
procedures, for example, a number of indigenous leaders complained that they have yet to 
see significant change in the decision-making of government agents about matters of 
crucial concern to their peoples, in particular decisions about lands that are outside of 
indigenous-controlled areas but that nonetheless affect their access to natural or cultural 
resources or environmental well-being.  
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur also repeatedly heard concerns about a lack of sufficient 
funding for housing, health, education, environmental remediation, women&#8217;s health and 
</p>
<p>safety, language and other programmes, concerns that were raised by both federal officials 
and representatives of indigenous peoples. Also pointed out were complicated or confusing 
bureaucratic procedures, and an inadequate understanding and awareness among 
government officials about tribal realities or even about the content of relevant laws and 
policies themselves. 
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur observes, nonetheless, that the overall thrust of the policy 
underlying the federal legislation and programmes adopted in the last few decades &#8211; a 
policy of advancing indigenous self-determination and development with respect for 
cultural identity &#8211; is generally in line with the aspirations expressed by indigenous peoples. 
The problems signalled are that the laws and programmes do not go far enough to meet 
those aspirations and that they are underfunded or inadequately administered. The Special 
Rapporteur takes special note, moreover, that they fail to go so far as to ultimately resolve 
persistent, deep-seated problems. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The need for determined action within a programme of reconciliation 
</b></p>
<p>72. It is evident that numerous matters relating to the history of misdealing and harm 
inflicted on indigenous peoples are still unresolved. In all his consultations with indigenous 
peoples during his visit to the United States, it was impressed upon the Special Rapporteur 
that historical wrongs continue to live in intergenerational memory and trauma, and that, 
together with current systemic problems, they still inflict harm. Across the United States, he 
heard of specific unresolved problems of historical origins and systemic dimensions, and 
indigenous representatives made abundantly clear that these problems continue to breed 
disharmony, dislocation and hardship.   
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur is of the firm view that, unless genuine movement is made 
toward resolving these pending matters, the place of indigenous peoples within the United 
States will continue to be an unstable, disadvantaged and inequitable one, and the country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>moral standing will suffer. Determined action should take place within a cross-cultural, 
encompassing programme of reconciliation, aimed at closing the latent wounds and 
building just and equitable conditions, and at providing needed redress consistent with the 
United States&#8217; human rights obligations.   
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur notes that the Government took a step that could be one on a 
path toward reconciliation, when in 2010 Congress adopted a resolution of apology to the 
indigenous peoples of the country, following in the spirit of the apology previously issued 
to Native Hawaiians (para. 65 above). Acknowledging widespread wrongdoing, the 
Apology states: &#8220;The United States, acting through Congress &#8230; apologizes on behalf of the 
</p>
<p>people of the United States for the many instances of violence, maltreatment and neglect 
inflicted on Native Peoples by citizens of the United States [and] expresses its regret&#8221;. The </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>apology also &#8220;urges the President to acknowledge the wrongs of the United States against 
</p>
<p>Indian tribes in the history of the United States in order to bring healing to this land.&#8221;16 The 
full text of the apology bears reading. However, strangely, the apology was buried deep in a 
defense appropriations act, and apparently few indigenous people, much less the public in 
general, were made aware of it. 
</p>
<p>75. Such an apology should not go unnoticed. Rather, it should be a point of public 
awakening and mark a path toward reconciliation, a path for concrete steps to address 
issues whose resolution is essential to defeating disharmony, and a path toward more 
enlightened framing of relations between indigenous peoples and the United States.  
</p>
<p>76. Among the pending issues that should be addressed with firm determination, within 
a programme of reconciliation, are the severed or frayed connections with culturally 
significant landscapes and sacred sites, such as those resulting from the taking of the Black 
Hills or from environmental pollution in countless places; imposed limitations on 
indigenous self-governance capacity, such as that preventing indigenous authorities from 
acting with full force to combat violence against women; the pathologies left by the 
removal of indigenous children from their communities; and other persistent symbols of 
subordination, such as the refusal of the United States thus far to make good on its long-
standing promise to provide reparations for the Sand Creek massacre. Also to be addressed 
are the pervasive problems left in the aftermath of Alaska Statehood and the Alaska Native 
Claims Settlement Act, and the still not remedied, yet acknowledged, suppression of 
indigenous Hawaiian sovereignty.  
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur notes the previous significant effort made by the United 
States to comprehensively resolve the grievances of Indian tribes by its creation in 1946 of 
the Indian Claims Commission and by extending the Commission&#8217;s authority widely to 
include claims based on &#8220;fair and honourable dealings,&#8221; inter alia. Over its life the 
Commission determined hundreds of land claims based on treaties or ancestral occupation, 
but the only remedies provided under the relevant statute were for monetary compensation 
upon a finding of extinguishment or taking of rights, a product of the assimilationist frame 
of thinking of the period in which the Commission was created, which left many 
fundamental issues unresolved or further complicated. Still the establishment of the 
Commission represents the capacity of the United States to take sweeping action to address 
evident wrongs on the basis of prevailing policy preferences.  
</p>
<p>78. What is now needed is a resolve to take action to address the pending, deep-seated 
concerns of indigenous peoples, but within current notions of justice and the human rights 
of indigenous peoples. Exemplifying the kind of restorative action to be taken consistent 
with contemporary human rights values is the return of the sacred Blue Lake to Taos 
Pueblo and the restoration of land to the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe. Both land areas were 
restored from land under federal administration, with no consequence for any individual 
property interests. Another exemplary action is the more recent initiative to transfer 
management of national park lands to the Oglala Sioux Tribe in South Dakota. Such 
measures reveal a needed understanding of the centrality of land and geographic spaces to 
the physical and cultural well-being of indigenous peoples, in accordance with standards 
now prevailing internationally and accepted by the United States.

<p><b> V. The significance of the Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples  
</b></p>
<p>79. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples stands as an 
important impetus and guide for measures to address the concerns of indigenous peoples in 
the United States and to move toward reconciliation. An authoritative instrument with 
broad support, the Declaration marks a path toward remedying the injustices and 
inequitable conditions faced by indigenous peoples, calling on determined action to secure 
their rights, within a model of respect for their self-determination and distinctive cultural 
identities.  
</p>
<p>80. The Declaration represents a global consensus among Governments and indigenous 
peoples worldwide that is joined in by the United States as well as by indigenous peoples in 
the country. It was adopted by the General Assembly with the affirmative votes of an 
overwhelming majority of United Nations Member States amid expressions of celebration 
by indigenous peoples from around the world. At the urging of indigenous leaders from 
throughout the country, the United States declared its support for the Declaration on 16 
December 2010, reversing its earlier position.   
</p>
<p>81. By its very nature, the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is not legally 
binding, but it is nonetheless an extension of the commitment assumed by United Nations 
Member States &#8211; including the United States &#8211; to promote and respect human rights under 
the United Nations Charter, customary international law, and multilateral human rights 
treaties to which the United States is a Party, including the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination.17 
</p>
<p>82. Whatever its precise legal significance, the Declaration embodies a convergence of 
common understanding about the rights of indigenous peoples, upon a foundation of 
fundamental human rights, including rights of equality, self-determination, property and 
cultural integrity. It is a product of more than two decades of deliberations in which the 
experiences and aspirations of indigenous peoples worldwide, along with failures and 
successes of the relevant laws and policies of States, were closely examined, with a view 
toward promoting human rights.  
</p>
<p>83. With these characteristics, the Declaration is now part of United States domestic and 
foreign policy, as made clear in the United States&#8217; announcement that its endorsement of 
the instrument: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; reflects the U.S. commitment to work with [indigenous] tribes, individuals, and 
communities to address the many challenges they face. The United States aspires to 
improve relations with indigenous peoples by looking to the principles embodied in 
the Declaration in its dealings with federally recognized tribe, while also working, as 
appropriate, with all indigenous individuals and communities in the United States.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Moreover, the United States is committed to serving as a model in the international 
community in promoting and protecting the collective rights of indigenous peoples 
as well as the human rights of all individuals. 
</p>
<p>84. As part of United States domestic and foreign policy, an extension of its 
international human right commitments, and reflecting a commitment to indigenous peoples 
in the United States, the Declaration should now serve as a beacon for executive, legislative 
and judicial decision-makers in relation to issues concerning the indigenous peoples of the 
</p>
<p>  
 17 See A/HRC/9/9, paras. 18-43. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p>country. All such decision-making should incorporate awareness and close consideration of 
the Declaration&#8217;s terms. Moreover, the Declaration is an instrument that should motivate 
</p>
<p>and guide steps toward still-needed reconciliation with the country&#8217;s indigenous peoples, on 
just terms.   
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>Indigenous peoples in the United States </b>&#8211;<b> including American Indian, Alaska 
Native and Native Hawaiian peoples </b>&#8211;<b> constitute vibrant communities that have 
</b></p>
<p><b>contributed greatly to the life of the country. Yet they face significant challenges that 
</b></p>
<p><b>are related to widespread historical wrongs and misguided government policies that 
</b></p>
<p><b>today manifest themselves in various indicators of disadvantage and impediments to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the exercise of their individual and collective rights. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Existing federal legislation and executive programmes 
</b></p>
<p>86.<b> Many acts of Congress and federal programmes that have been developed over 
the last few decades </b>&#8211;<b> in contrast to earlier exercises of federal power based on 
</b></p>
<p><b>misguided policies </b>&#8211;<b> constitute good practices that in significant measure respond to 
</b></p>
<p>indigenous peoples&#8217; concerns. Especially to be commended are the many new 
</p>
<p><b>initiatives taken by the executive to advance the rights of indigenous peoples in the last 
</b></p>
<p><b>few years. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  The need to build on good practices and advance toward reconciliation 
</b></p>
<p>87.<b> Relevant authorities should take steps to address the concerns of indigenous 
leaders that, in certain respects, federal legislation protective of their rights is not 
</b></p>
<p><b>adequately implemented and that federal programmes are not adequately funded or 
</b></p>
<p><b>administered.  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>Further, the federal executive and Congress should respond to initiatives 
promoted by indigenous peoples for new or amended legislation and programmes,  in 
</b></p>
<p><b>accordance with the international human rights commitments of the United States.  
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>Despite positive aspects of existing legislation and programmes, new measures 
are needed to advance reconciliation with indigenous peoples and to provide redress 
</b></p>
<p><b>for persistent deep-seated problems. Federal authorities should identify, develop and 
</b></p>
<p><b>implement such measures in full consultation and coordination with indigenous 
</b></p>
<p><b>peoples.   
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>Measures of reconciliation and redress should include, inter alia, initiatives to 
address outstanding claims of treaty violations or non-consensual takings of 
</b></p>
<p><b>traditional lands to which indigenous peoples retain cultural or economic attachment, 
</b></p>
<p>and to restore or secure indigenous peoples&#8217; capacities to maintain connections with 
</p>
<p><b>places and sites of cultural or religious significance, in accordance with the United 
</b></p>
<p><b>States international human rights commitments. In this regard, the return of Blue 
</b></p>
<p><b>Lake to Taos Pueblo, the restoration of land to the Timbisha Shoshone, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>establishment of the Oglala Sioux Tribal Park, and current initiatives of the National 
</b></p>
<p><b>Park Service and the United States Forest Service to protect sacred sites, constitute 
</b></p>
<p><b>important precedents or moves in this direction.   
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>Other measures of reconciliation should include efforts to identify and heal 
particular sources of open wounds. And hence, for example, promised reparations 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be provided to the descendants of the Sands Creek massacre, and new or 
</b></p>
<p><b>renewed consideration should be given to clemency for Leonard Peltier.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>Issues of self-governance, environmental degradation, language restoration, 
and federal recognition, as well as the particular concerns of indigenous peoples in 
</b></p>
<p><b>urban settings and border areas, among other matters, should also be addressed. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is an 
important impetus and guide for improving upon existing measures to address the 
</b></p>
<p><b>concerns of indigenous peoples in the United States, and for developing new measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>to advance toward reconciliation. The Declaration represents an international 
</b></p>
<p><b>standard accepted by the United States, at the urging of indigenous peoples from 
</b></p>
<p><b>across the country, and is an extension of the United States historical leadership and 
</b></p>
<p><b>commitment to promote human rights under various sources of international law. 
</b></p>
<p><b>With these characteristics, the Declaration is a benchmark for all relevant decision-
</b></p>
<p><b>making by the federal executive, Congress, and the judiciary, as well as by the states 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the United States.   
</b></p>
<p><b>  The federal executive 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The federal executive should work closely with indigenous leaders, at all levels 
of decision-making, to identify and remove any barriers to effective implementation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>existing government programmes and directives, and to improve upon them. In this 
</b></p>
<p><b>regard, efforts should be made to ensure coordinated and clear delineation of tasks 
</b></p>
<p><b>among the various government agencies working on indigenous issues, effective means 
</b></p>
<p><b>of interaction and consultation with indigenous peoples, and coherent, coordinated 
</b></p>
<p><b>federal executive action on indigenous issues.  
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>In keeping with the expressed commitment of the United States to the 
principles of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and its related 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights obligations, the President should consider issuing a 
</b></p>
<p><b>directive to all executive agencies to adhere to the Declaration in all their decision-
</b></p>
<p><b>making concerning indigenous peoples.  
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>Independently of such a presidential directive, given that the Declaration has 
already been adopted as part of United States policy, all executive agencies that touch 
</b></p>
<p><b>upon indigenous affairs should become fully aware of the meaning of the Declaration 
</b></p>
<p><b>with respect to their respective spheres of responsibility, and they should ensure that 
</b></p>
<p><b>their decisions and consultation procedures are consistent with the Declaration. To 
</b></p>
<p><b>this end there should be a crosscutting executive level campaign to ensure awareness 
</b></p>
<p><b>about the content and meaning of the Declaration.  
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>In following up to the apology resolution adopted by Congress in 2010, which 
</b>directs the President to pursue reconciliation with the country&#8217;s indigenous peoples, 
</p>
<p><b>the President should develop, in consultation with them, a set of relevant initiatives in 
</b></p>
<p><b>accordance with paragraphs 87-92 above. As an initial measure, the President should 
</b></p>
<p><b>make the apology resolution widely known among indigenous peoples and the public 
</b></p>
<p><b>at large, in a way that is appropriate to the sensitivities and aspirations of indigenous 
</b></p>
<p><b>peoples, and within a broader program</b>me<b> that contributes to public education about 
indigenous peoples and the issues they face.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Congress 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>Congress should act promptly on legislative proposals advocated by indigenous 
leaders for the protection of their </b>peoples&#8217; rights, and ensure that any legislation 
</p>
<p><b>concerning indigenous peoples is adopted in consultation with them. Particular, 
</b></p>
<p><b>immediate priority should be placed on legislation advocated by indigenous peoples </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p><b>and proposed by the executive to extend protection for indigenous women against 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence by, inter alia, enlarging the law enforcement capacities of tribal authorities. 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>Following up to the hearing on the Declaration held by the Senate Committee 
on Indian Affairs on 9 June 2011, Congress should hold hearings to educate its 
</b></p>
<p><b>members about the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and to consider 
</b></p>
<p><b>specific legislative measures that are needed to fully implement the rights affirmed 
</b></p>
<p><b>therein. Attention should be paid to aspects of already existing legislation that should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be reformed, and to new legislation that could advance needed measures of 
</b></p>
<p><b>reconciliation. Consideration should also be given to providing judicial remedies for 
</b></p>
<p><b>infringements of rights incorporated in the Declaration. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>Congress should, in consultation with indigenous peoples, enact legislative 
reforms or altogether new legislation as required to achieve the reconciliation called 
</b></p>
<p><b>for in its apology resolution of 2010.  
</b></p>
<p>101.<b> Any legislation adopted by Congress should be in alignment with the human 
rights standards represented by the Declaration. To this end Congress should consider 
</b></p>
<p><b>adopting a resolution affirming the Declaration as the policy of United States and 
</b></p>
<p><b>declaring its resolve to exercise its power to advance the principles and goals of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Declaration.  
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>At a minimum, Congress should continuously refrain from exercising any 
</b>purported power to unilaterally extinguish indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, with the 
</p>
<p><b>understanding that to do so would be morally wrong and against United States 
</b></p>
<p><b>domestic and foreign policy, and that it would incur responsibility for the United 
</b></p>
<p><b>States under its international human rights obligations.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  The federal judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>The federal judiciary, in particular the United States Supreme Court, has 
played a significant role in defining the rights and status of indigenous peoples. While 
</b></p>
<p><b>affirming indigenous peoples</b>&#8217;<b> rights and inherent sovereignty, it has also articulated 
</b></p>
<p><b>grounds for limiting those rights on the basis of colonial era doctrine that is out of step 
</b></p>
<p><b>with contemporary human rights values. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>Consistent with well-established methods of judicial reasoning, the federal 
courts should discard such colonial era doctrine in favour of an alternative 
</b></p>
<p><b>jurisprudence infused with the contemporary human rights values that have been 
</b></p>
<p><b>embraced by the United States, including those values reflected in the United Nations 
</b></p>
<p><b>Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Furthermore, just as the Supreme 
</b></p>
<p><b>Court looked to the law of nations of the colonial era to define bedrock principles 
</b></p>
<p><b>concerning the rights and status of indigenous peoples, it should now look to 
</b></p>
<p><b>contemporary international law, to which the Declaration is connected, for the same 
</b></p>
<p><b>purposes. 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>Accordingly, the federal courts should interpret, or reinterpret, relevant 
doctrine, treaties and statutes in light of the Declaration, both in regard to the nature 
</b></p>
<p>of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights and the nature of federal power.   <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  The states of the United States 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>Although competency over indigenous affairs rests at the federal level, states of 
the United States exercise authority that in various ways affects the rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>indigenous peoples. Relevant state authorities should become aware of the rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>indigenous peoples affirmed in the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>23 
</b></p>
<p><b>and develop state policies to promote the goals of the Declaration and to ensure that 
</b></p>
<p><b>the decisions of state authorities are consistent with it. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  </b>Indigenous peoples&#8217; authorities<b> 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>Indigenous authorities should endeavour to educate the members of their 
tribes, nations or communities about the Declaration and its contents. They should 
</b></p>
<p><b>apply the Declaration in their own self-governance, as well as use it as a common point 
</b></p>
<p><b>of understanding in dealings with federal and state legislative, executive and judicial 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Alaska and Hawaii 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>The situations in Alaska and Hawaii are each unique and merit particular 
attention and action on the part of the United States to secure the rights of indigenous 
</b></p>
<p><b>peoples there.  The Special Rapporteur intends to address these situations further in 
</b></p>
<p><b>future communications with the United States.  </b></p>
