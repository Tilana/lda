professional and experienced team who have and continue 
to deliver the engineering, environmental, geological, and 
community work required. This team has been built up over 
the past year to include a number of key personnel, and has 
been led by the General Manager Technical Mr Justin Haines.
In addition to the expanding operational team, we maintain 
and continue to strengthen the corporate team. We continue 
to strengthen the board with members with suitable skill 
sets and we are very pleased to have both Mr Greg English 
and Mr Murray Chatfield join as Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. We will continue to work towards having a board 
where there is a majority of Independent Non-Executive 
Directors and expect this to occur during the 2016/17 year.
The Company has formed a number of important 
relationships over the past 12 months, and I am extremely 
pleased to report that in April 2016 the Company signed 
a Heads of Agreement with Shanghai Electric Power 
Generation Group, to discuss the formation of a joint venture 
company to build, own and operate a gas fired power 
station in South Australia. This relationship is important for 
the Company and the State as the building, owning and 
operating of a power station ensures the success of the 
LCEP and has the ability to provide cheaper, reliable base 
load power to industries and mines in South Australia.

CHAIRMAN’S LETTER
Dear Shareholders,
I am pleased to be able to report that Leigh Creek Energy 
Limited (LCK) has reached a number of significant milestones 
during the year enabling the progression of the Leigh Creek 
Energy Project (LCEP).
We commenced the 2014/15 financial year with the clear 
direction of producing methane and then subsequently 
fertiliser from the LCEP. However, over the course of the year, 
it became apparent that due to changing market conditions 
in South Australia that electricity generation should become 
a key component of the LCEP. South Australia has seen 
a confluence of events that have led to the attractive 
commercial position of being able to produce cheap reliable 
base load power for external customers.
We have seen the closure of the Pt Augusta Power Station, 
the closure of the Leigh Creek Coal mine by Alinta Energy, 
the increase in non- base load wind power, and talk of 
decommissioning of coal fired power stations in Victoria. 
Cumulatively these events have put increased pressure on 
the ability of large electricity users in South Australia to be 
able to secure base load power without risk of disruption and 
at a reasonable price.
Operationally, the Company delivered on two key goals 
to certify the coal and gas resources at Leigh Creek. In 
January 2016, the Company announced the achievement 
of a 2C SPE-PRMS ISG gas resource of 2,963.9 PJ at the 
LCEP reported in accordance with the Society of Petroleum 
Engineers – Petroleum Resources Management System. 
This report followed, and utilised the Geological Modelling 
Report announced in December 2015, which had provided 
the estimate of the Inferred Coal Resource reported in 
accordance with the JORC Code 2012.
The achievement of a gas resource of this size is significant, 
particularly in the context of the Eastern Australian Gas 
Market. This is an exciting and important milestone in 
the development of the LCEP and underpins our original 
assumption that the LCEP contains significant quantities of 
recoverable gas. The independent gas resource certification 
helps accelerate the LCEP development as it provides added 
confidence to domestic and international buyers of gas, 
investors in LCK and future debt providers.
Whilst the Company was to initially undertake a drill program 
in order to certify the resources, we were fortunately able to 
access key historical data late last year. This discovery was 
important and allowed the project to progress quickly and 
efficiently at reduced spend. The operational milestones 
that we have reached have been possible due to a diligent,
2
Leigh Creek Energy remains focused 
on delivering the LCEP and in the short 
term reaching gas demonstration
I would like to thank all of our shareholders for your 
support over the last 12 months and all our employees and 
contractors for your commitment to the Company and our 
achievements of the last year and look forward to updating 
the market of our progress over the next 12 months.
Sincerely,
Mr Justyn Peters
Executive Chairman
CHAIRMAN’S LETTER
The Company also announced the signing of a non-binding 
Heads of Agreement with APT Pipelines Limited, a subsidiary 
of APA Group. Under this Heads of Agreement, the 
Companies have been working together and reviewing the 
connection of the LCEP to the eastern Australian 
gas markets.
The Company continues to maintain a strong relationship 
with Archer Exploration regarding the use of the LCEP gas, 
electricity and waste heat, and with AET Investments on 
the establishment of an ammonium nitrate plant to produce 
nitrogen based fertilisers for South Australian farmers who 
must now import 100% of their requirements.
At Leigh Creek, we are working closely with Alinta Energy 
and the wider Leigh Creek and Copley communities and we 
have gained considerable support for the project.
Leigh Creek Energy remains focused on delivering the 
LCEP and in the short term reaching gas demonstration. To 
reach this goal, significant environmental baseline studies 
are required but are yet to be completed. However, this 
monitoring is well underway and has been assisted by the 
Company’s recent capital raise.
Despite difficult market conditions, the Company raised 
$10.77 million through a private placement announced April 
2016. This placement, securing our financial position, was 
another important step forward for the Company.
As a company we have some very big milestones to both 
meet and achieve over the next 12 months. Amongst them 
being securing binding off take agreements for electricity and 
gas, the furtherance of our relationships with APT, Shanghai 
Electric and Archer Exploration, and most importantly the 
completion of baseline studies, and approvals permitting the 
pre-commercial gas demonstration at Leigh Creek.

MANAGING DIRECTOR’S REPORT
Dear Shareholders,
I am extremely pleased to be able to share with you our 
progress and plans with you at this time of rapid growth as 
we move quickly towards pre-commercial gas demonstration 
and then commercial gas production aimed for 2019. We 
intend to commence with power generation, for our own 
needs and those of nearby major customers, and then move 
quickly to gas sales via a new pipeline linking us to the major 
pipeline system and from there to customers across Eastern 
Australia. We are also, now, investigating opportunities to 
produce peaking power so that we can provide electricity to 
South Australia at times of high demand when wind energy is 
not despatching at high volumes.
Our motto ‘Reliable Energy for South Australia’ is important 
to us for many reasons. The State is suffering from high 
unemployment, high gas prices (recently doubled), high 
power prices (recently almost tripled) and unreliable power 
supply. At the same time our expected low power costs and 
potential opportunities to consume or sequester carbon 
dioxide (CO2) should reduce our environmental footprint. 
More widely the East Coast of Australia is expecting gas 
shortages due to the impact of the new Liquefied Natural Gas 
(LNG) projects in Queensland which have combined to more 
than triple gas demand. On the supply side Governments in 
many states have acted to restrict new gas developments 
either by not supporting clear legal frameworks or on 
environmental grounds.
The changing gas and electricity markets place LCK in a 
strong position given our certified recoverable gas resource 
position of 2,964 PJ (near 3.0 TCF) and our location within 
a state with strong government support and at Leigh Creek 
with its substantial existing infrastructure.
The LCEP is advancing rapidly towards pre-commercial gas 
demonstration aimed for the March quarter of 2017. We then 
aim to head into full field commercial planning, engineering 
and to move through the commercial approval process.
Together these factors help support our ambition to create 
wealth for shareholders, jobs and royalties for South Australia 
and also help enable our local communities as well as 
existing and new businesses.
Year Ended 30 June 2016
LCK incurred a loss of $5,366,248 for the year ended 
30 June 2016 and LCK will pay no dividend.
The current year loss is due to pre-development spend on 
the LCEP and associated administration and support efforts 
and was funded by raising equity from shareholders and also 
from the full sell down of shares we owned in ourselves.
The comparison with the 2015 year loss of $17.6 million is 
problematic as that year incorporated a reverse takeover (at 
June 29) which incurred a non-cash charge of $16.7 million 
to the profit and loss
We ended the current year with $8,659,369 cash at hand.
Reliable Energy Needed - Electricity
Power prices being offered in South Australia for the period 
2017-2019 have near tripled compared to recent years and 
power outages are now occasionally occurring.

MANAGING DIRECTOR’S REPORT
In South Australia, disruption to 
normal power supply is now not 
uncommon
South Australia’s dedication to renewable energy (wind 
and solar) sees it ranked number 1 in Australia in terms of 
installed capacity as a share of total capacity. The ageing 
electricity grid across Eastern Australia was designed 
originally for generally one way flows of electricity originating 
from base load power stations and heading towards 
customers.
Electricity supply has also altered. Gas fired peaking stations 
can fire up or down quickly. Solar energy ramps up into 
the middle of the day, generally at people’s homes when 
electricity is not required, and drops off as night falls. Wind 
energy is available only when there is adequate wind.
These factors have put enormous strain on the electricity 
network, the poles, wires, substations and transformers – 
which ideally need an overhaul to better cope with variable 
direction flows. Disruption to normal power supply is now not 
uncommon.
This means that when power is not available in South 
Australia to meet demand, the State is reliant on the 
interconnector with Victoria. Unfortunately the interconnector 
itself can go down, due to maintenance or bushfire. The 
interconnect can also fail to provide electricity if Victoria is 
suffering a heatwave itself and thus absorbs local electricity 
generated, leaving nothing for those sweltering in the heat in 
Adelaide and surrounding population centres.
Power demand is obviously dependent on weather 
conditions in terms of variable demand. Variable demand 
arises from such things as TV’s being turned on in the 
evening and air conditioners being switched on during 
summer. The swing between hot day (red), cold day (blue) 
and mild day (yellow) power use is dramatic, as shown in 
the following graph which highlights instantaneous power 
demand across South Australia in MW for a typical 24 hour 
period from 4pm in the afternoon through the lows at 4am 
and back to 4pm in the afternoon.

MANAGING DIRECTOR’S REPORT
South Australian manufacturing and mining industries require 
reliable power supply at a reasonable price. At this time 
we are advancing discussions with major power users and 
expect to develop agreements which will allow both parties 
to co-ordinate planning ahead of signing electricity supply 
agreements.
Our aim is to have a win: win. Large users get a long term 
secure supply of electricity at a reasonable price so they 
can make capital allocation decisions. For LCK long term 
contracts help support our financing efforts and lock in 
margins so we can create annuity streams.
Reliable Energy Needed - Gas
The Australian regulator is predicting gas shortages 
across the East Coast gas network from late 2018 due to 
the impact of high gas demand from the new export LNG 
facilities in Queensland.
Gas prices have doubled in the last few years, from $3:50/GJ 
towards around $7:00/GJ and many predict gas prices to rise 
even further. Spot gas prices during the recent cold weather 
in Southern Australia exceeded $20:00/GJ.
New gas supplies would in normal circumstance limit 
expected shortages and new developments and or gas 
exploration would act to secure much needed new gas 
reserves. However, this general supply response to rising 
prices and predicted shortfalls has been hindered by 
numerous factors:
•  Low oil prices have reduced energy company cash flows
and harmed balance sheets – with the result of cuts to 
exploration budgets.
•    Environmental agitation has increased in specific 
jurisdictions, sometimes with government support 
(particularly, NSW, Victoria and Queensland) and this has 
increased legal uncertainty that has – halted, reduced or 
delayed new gas developments.
•    Victoria introduced a Moratorium for new onshore oil and
gas exploration.
•    Queensland recently introduced tougher environmental
legislation making directors prosecutable ahead 
of Companies being found guilty and even placing 
shareholders liable for environmental matters.
Our marketing efforts have confirmed strong interest in 
new gas supply and we anticipate this will increase as time 
unfolds and as we head towards and successfully complete 
our pre-commercial gas demonstration.
Low Emission Energy
As the world moves to reduce CO2 emissions it is beholden 
on LCK to strive to minimise our own environmental footprint. 
We are investigating various methods of sequestration 
(e.g. in ISG cavities or rapid forest establishment) as well 
as consumption of CO2 in fertiliser manufacture or other 
products derived from our gas.
Government Support
A day does not go by when the wider LCK family does not 
celebrate its original decision to focus on opportunities within 
South Australia, both because of the tremendous support we 
receive in South Australia but also when we see the impacts 
of the various forms of lack of government support in gas 
projects elsewhere.
We feel we are very much in partnership whereby we work 
closely with government, as we follow pre-defined and a 
prescribed regulatory process. We operate largely within the 
Petroleum Act which is clear legislation and provides legal 
certainty for our project.
The government departments we deal with, primarily the 
Department of State Development, are highly professional, 
efficient and pro-active. It is not surprising then, that South 
Australia is repeatedly named as one of the best destinations 
globally for its support of the Petroleum industry as 
confirmed in the annual Fraser Institute Surveys (originated 
in Canada).
Such accolades open doors overseas for LCK and definitely 
aid our financing efforts both with potential shareholders 
and with banks (future debt providers). When I share the 
LCK story with overseas parties the first question is always 
about ‘What level of legal clarity and government support 
do we have?’ and I am happy to provide our response. This 
contrasts strongly with how other Australian states deal with 
the Gas Industry whereby some Australian States are being 
named as ‘off-limits for new investment’.
The Australian regulator is 
predicting gas shortages 
across the East Coast gas 
network from late 2018

MANAGING DIRECTOR’S REPORT
The reliability of power and the price of power 
is a critical issue for all South Australians
Community Engagement
Following an extensive community engagement program, 
LCK is well known across a wide area of South Australia. 
We have the potential to positively impact thousands of 
people directly and tens of thousands indirectly in regional 
communities.
The reliability of power and the price of power is a critical 
issue for all South Australians, but even more so in 
communities suffering major job losses such as Whyalla, 
Port Augusta and Leigh Creek itself following the closure of 
the Leigh Creek Coal mine in November 2015.
We hope to help enable the survival of existing businesses 
in these communities as well as enable major investment 
decisions to be made by companies in our region who may 
like to expand and promote other opportunities for new 
industries in the region.
LCK is committed to using suppliers from South Australia and 
in particular from the Upper Spencer Gulf Region wherever 
possible. It is our hope that this strategy will be proven 
effective in the coming year during the construction and 
operation of the pre-commercial demonstration facility.
Having effectively provided ongoing information to the 
community in the previous year about the LCEP, LCK will 
now move to a more formal, structured community 
engagement effort as we ensure that we engage with the 
community more broadly.
LCEP Location
As you know we operate in and around the Leigh Creek 
Coal Field. Although the former coal mine has ceased coal 
production, Alinta Energy staff remain at site dedicated to 
various tasks including rehabilitation. We therefore interact 
with Alinta staff and contractors and I wish to take this 
opportunity to thank Alinta for their support of LCK as our 
efforts ramp up.
will derive significant benefits in terms of cost and time to 
production. Access to the existing rail line would also allow 
for the import of supplies and the export of finished goods.
Research and Development
Our commitment to innovation extends beyond being 
the first to develop a commercial ISG project in Australia, 
which in itself benefits from the interaction of existing oil 
industry technology, plant and equipment when configured 
appropriately.
We also have the opportunity to best utilise by-products and 
waste products in order to maximise financial returns and 
minimise our environmental footprint. In particular we aim to 
consume or sequester much of our CO2. 
It is early on in our R&D investigations but we note that 
we should have abundant low cost energy, and waste 
heat which if utilised appropriately can support low cost 
sequestration of CO2 both underground and also in nurseries 
supporting rapid growth trees.
Working Smarter
In addition to our research and development activities, 
LCK recognises that it operates in the “new” economy. We 
deliberately and constantly look for smart ways to apply 
modern technology where there is a potential to improve our 
performance. One example of this is the use of virtual reality.
As an aide to our investor relations effort we have 
commissioned a virtual reality video using Convergen of 
Adelaide.
Interested parties will soon be able to experience a visit to the 
LCEP site via full surround virtual reality. They will be able to 
experience the following over a period of a few minutes:
•
Inspect the significant established infrastructure at Leigh 
Creek; town, airport, railway, sealed roads, optic fibre, 
fresh water dam and power to site.
There is existing infrastructure at the site resulting from 
the past open cut mining operations. If we can negotiate 
long term access to this infrastructure with Alinta then LCK
•  Visit the Leigh Creek Coal Field where coal has been 
extracted since the 1940’s to see the extent of existing 
infrastructure and the altered nature of landforms.

Conclusion and Thanks
LCK is presently gearing up efforts in support of approvals 
and the necessary engineering efforts ahead of commencing 
“pre-commercial gas demonstration” at the LCEP. Around 
this focus is wide ranging and growing efforts that span such 
fields as safety, community engagement, environmental 
science, finance, commercial work, investor relations and 
many other disciplines.
We are also seeking to add more professionals to the 
team and our board and further integrate ourselves in our 
community so that our dream of ‘Reliable Energy for South 
Australia’ can be realised for the betterment of many.
I wish to take this opportunity to sincerely thank our staff, 
contractors, shareholders and the many stakeholders 
in our wider community that we touch on a daily basis 
for their support of LCK. The company has experienced 
rapid growth on all fronts over the last year and is actively 
managing further growth. Such success and effort can only 
be successful with the hard work and generosity of spirit of 
all concerned. Having been at the start of the LCK story it is 
simply wonderful to witness the progress and momentum 
now gathering.
I look forward to the challenges of the year ahead and to 
reporting to you all frequently as tangible progress occurs.
Sincerely,
David Shearwood 
 
  Managing Director
LCK acknowledges and respects the culture and history of 
the Traditional Owners, being the Adnyamathanha people, of 
the lands around the region in which we operate.
LCK is committed to positive engagement with 
Adnyamathanha Traditional Land Association (ATLA) and 
the participation of indigenous people on the LCEP and 
associated infrastructure.
Financing
LCK requires capital until we reach the point of generating 
free cash flow. At present, we are analysing options spanning 
the spectrum between debt and equity and in this regard I 
wish to thank EAS Advisors LLC for their planning efforts and 
strategic advice.
The LCEP has many components that are essentially 
infrastructure in nature:
•  Gas pipeline
•  Power generation
•  High voltage electricity transmission
•  Oxygen plant
These lend themselves to appropriate gearing and indeed 
could be built and owned by others.
We have attracted and enjoy our relationship, at present via, 
Heads of Agreement with APA Group – Australia’s largest 
pipeline owner and also Shanghai Electric Power Generation 
Group (Or Shanghai Electric Corp.) - one of the world’s 
largest manufacturers of turbines and electricity generation 
plant and equipment.
LCK will need additional equity and the vast bulk of this is 
intended to come from the proceeds of a farm out of part of 
the LCEP. This effort has now commenced and anticipated 
to be final after pre-commercial gas demonstration has 
occurred.
The Year Ahead 2016/17
Much work is already underway and indeed the milestones 
planned require considerable additional internal effort and 
external support. Our spend will rise as our key focus is to:
•  Operationally – safely conduct pre-commercial gas
demonstration at the LCEP.
•  Feasibility – complete commercial scale prefeasibility
studies.
•  Planning – add to full field commercial gas development
engineering and approval efforts.
•  Widen and deepen our relationship with the communities
in which we operate.
•  Widen and deepen our relationship with global capital
providers (debt and equity).
•  Sell off, via farm-out, part of the LCEP where we presently
enjoy 100% ownership.

LEIGH CREEK ENERGY PROJECT
ISG consumes less surface water and 
generates less atmospheric pollution 
compared to surface gasification
A New Energy Source for South Australia
The LCEP represents a significant new energy source that 
can support:
•
reliable power generation in South Australia.
•  add to gas supply on the East coast of Australia.
•
feed fertiliser and explosives manufacture (replacing 
imports) for South Australia for the State’s farmers and 
mining industry.
Our focus has always been power generation first, to meet 
our own internal needs ahead of gas sales via a new pipeline.
In the last six months this focus has been augmented to 
include power generation for external sales, because:
•  We believe this is a profitable and less complicated
initial stage as we are simply adding additional power 
generation and working with the players within the 
high voltage network to connect into, and interact with, 
the system.
•  capture, consumption and sequestration of
•  There is interest from major customers for reliable long
quantities of CO2.
The range, size and timing of the LCEP stages requires 
careful consideration as planning progresses.
We expect our present level of certified recoverable gas 
resources (2C: 2,963.9 PJ) to be a candidate for upgrade 
in early 2017 once the pre-commercial gas demonstration 
phase is complete and given that ISG is a replication process 
effort and differs from conventional oil and gas projects 
which suffer from reservoir risk. Reservoir risk describes the 
way petroleum production has a plateau rate and a decline 
curve. ISG is simply repeated.
In addition two themes have eventuated over the last year 
and have acted to focus our attention, being:
•  The problems within the electricity industry in South
Australia are larger than we first imagined – principally 
because the closure of coal fuelled base load power 
stations at Port Augusta have left the western part of the 
State vulnerable to power disruption and some of the 
highest electricity prices in the country; and
•  Perception is catching up with reality in the gas industry 
whereby gas customers are more open to higher prices 
and are seeing spot gas prices spiking upwards.
term base load electricity supply; and
•  This stage is a low capital cost effort which should 
produce significant cash flows - this gives greater 
flexibility to our longer term capital needs.
We have recently commissioned ElectraNet to provide advice 
around high voltage electricity transmission, route options, 
and advice around connection to the grid and participation 
within the National Electricity Market (NEM).
ElectraNet is the largest owner of electricity 
transmission assets in South Australia and provides 
advice to market participants (generators and load – 
being users of electricity).
We have also identified the opportunity to produce peaking 
power, being power which swings into times of electricity 
supply shortfalls, generally being when wind power is

Stages of the LCEP
The LCEP comprises many separate major components 
with most sequential in terms of timing and thus there are 
commercial, engineering and commissioning issues to 
be considered as we head towards full field commercial 
development. We are now conducting ‘trade off analysis’ and 
commencing feasibility studies across many opportunities. 
To emphasise the nature of the stepped aspects of the LCEP 
we outline details as follows:

resources in place and the LCEP’s location 
within a supportive South Australia 
framework and at Leigh Creek which has 
significant existing infrastructure.

Fertiliser and Explosives
A prefeasibility study will be completed in 2016/17 following 
the pre-commercial demonstration project. One of the likely 
outcomes is that an attractive pathway in full commercial 
operation will be the production of ammonium nitrate.
The bulk of the world’s fertiliser and explosives, by volume, 
is based on ammonium nitrate (AN) and these products are 
100% imported into South Australia resulted in generally high 
prices for end users being farmers, mines and quarries.
AN is usually produced by purchasing methane (CH4) which 
is treated to extract hydrogen via a capital and energy 
intensive process.
either manufacture AN ourselves or sell hydrogen over a 
fence to nearby and captive new AN facilities.
Hydrogen is valuable to us and has a number of potential 
end uses, as follows;
•  Some can go to power generation – however too much in 
the gas fuel mix can negatively impact the ‘wobbe index’ 
– because hydrogen burns faster than most fuels.
>  Hydrogen when burnt to make electricity produces
water as its only waste product.
•  Hydrogen can be reacted with carbon monoxide (CO) to 
produce additional methane (CH4) – however this requires 
additional plant.
•  Hydrogen can be consumed within AN manufacture for
fertiliser and explosives sales.
Hydrogen is the smallest of molecules making it difficult and 
expensive to transport and therefore we are not considering 
its sale or use outside the area of the LCEP itself. Initial 
market inquiries indicate a ready market in South Australia for 
fertiliser and explosives due to their current 100% imported 
and high cost nature.
Initial financial analysis indicates the best way to monetise 
excess hydrogen production at the LCEP is to sell hydrogen 
over the fence to a new and nearby AN facility, possibly 
owned by a third party.
The LCEP will produce significant quantities of hydrogen as 
a by-product of the ISG process and if we choose we can
LCK continues to meet with AETI investments regarding 
opportunities within the fertiliser area.

LEIGH CREEK ENERGY PROJECT
LCEP Description
Geology
Appraisal drilling planned for Q4 2015 was deferred 
because of the uncovering of previously unavailable historic 
information. The data included geophysical logging, coal 
quality data and original coal samples from the target seams 
at the LCEP.
The coal samples from the LCEP target coal seams were 
utilised for coal gasification testing, which showed that 
the Leigh Creek coal was capable of producing ISG Syngas 
at the rate of 15.2 GJ/tonne of coal gasified. This 
information underpinned the PRMS ISG Gas Resources 
certification work.
Assimilation and assessment of drill hole data and testing 
of coal samples resulted in a coal geological model and 
resource estimate being developed by GeoConsult Pty Ltd 
(GeoConsult), resulting in LCK announcing a coal Inferred 
Resource of 377 Million Tonnes (Mt) at the LCEP reported in 
accordance with the JORC Code (2012).
The estimate is based on:
•  A minimum seam thickness of 2m.
•  A maximum stone parting thickness of 1m.
•
ISG Resources were limited to a minimum overburden 
thickness of 200m.
•  Opencut Exploration Targets were limited to a maximum
overburden thickness of 200m.
•  Opencut Exploration Targets were limited to a base of
weathering grid model.
•  A fixed Relative Density of 1.4, was applied for the
Resource Estimation.
•  Points of observation spacing of 4km, (1km past the
last point) were used in the estimation where geological 
correlation supported lateral continuity.
•  Areas associated with major faulting located on the south
western basin edge (defined by seismic) have been 
excluded from Q and V Seam working section Resources. 
No faulting exclusions were applied from faults observed 
in pit mapping as full seam offsets were not observed.

Initial PRMS ISG Gas Resources Certification
On 8 January 2016, LCK announced an initial ISG Gas 
Resource at the LCEP of:
•	 1C 2,747.7 PJ
•	 2C 2,963.9 PJ
•	 3C 3,303.1 PJ
This was independently assessed and certified by MHA 
Petroleum Consultants LLC (MHA) and reported in 
accordance with the Society of Petroleum Engineers –
Petroleum Resources Management System (PRMS). MHA 
was provided with the Geological and Modelling Report 
prepared in December 2015 by GeoConsult which provided 
the estimate of the Inferred Coal Resource reported in 
accordance with the JORC Code 2012.
Seismic survey
LCK acquired 18.3 line kilometres of new 2D seismic data 
at the LCEP in early 2016. This survey provided valuable 
data enabling LCK to select a specific site for the ISG pre-
commercial gas demonstration facility.

LEIGH CREEK ENERGY PROJECT
Environment
LCK requires approval from various State government 
agencies before commencing Demonstration and 
Commercial ISG operations. Of particular relevance is the 
Department for State Development’s requirements for an 
Environmental Impact Report under the Petroleum and 
Geothermal Energy Act, 2000.
To develop the Environmental Impact Report, LCK is currently 
undertaking environmental investigations, in accordance with 
Environment Protection Authority (EPA) guidelines, to identify 
existing environmental conditions to understand existing 
impacts and landform modification from historic mining and 
related operations in the Leigh Creek Coalfield. A major 
part of the investigations is development of a preliminary 
Conceptual Site Model to understand relationships between 
landforms, groundwater and historic operations and their 
current and potential environmental impacts.
In addition to the Environmental Impact Report, LCK is 
required to prepare a Statement of Environmental Objectives 
(SEO), in which we outline the environmental objectives to 
which our ISG activities will conform, and the criteria upon 
which the achievement of these objectives will be assessed. 
All of these criteria will be based upon baseline information 
being gathered in the environmental investigations.
Detailed baseline data collection activities planned or being 
undertaken at the Leigh Creek site include:
•  Downhole Contaminant of Potential Concern (CoPC)
sampling to determine the presence and levels of 
naturally occurring CoPCs.
•  Downhole in situ permeability testing throughout the coal
basin sedimentary rocks.
•  Shallow water monitoring bores to collect information
about shallow groundwater.
•  Pump testing to confirm permeability measurements and 
any potential connectivity between stratigraphic horizons.
•
Installation of monitoring wells and water pressure 
sensors.
•  Flora and Fauna surveys.
•  Surface water sampling and monitoring.
•  Air quality testing and sampling.
•  Soil gas testing and monitoring.
•  Fixed real time weather station.
LCK is pleased to have partnered with local South 
Australian environmental consultancies in the development 
of environmental baseline investigations and approval 
documentation.

The Facility will comprise a series of air compressors 
feeding the below ground gasifier. Syngas will be extracted 
from the gasifier through a production well, after which the 
free water will be separated from the gas and measured and 
sampled. After gas analysis, the gas and free water will 
enter the thermal oxidiser where all components will be safely 
destroyed.
The Demonstration Phase activities undertaken during 
the year include engineering design of the surface and 
belowground equipment. Continuing through 2016 the 
Engineering Team will be focussed on finalising the 
process design, mechanical design, HAZOP risk assessment 
and the specification of piping, valves, instruments and 
control systems.
A risk based approach will be employed throughout the 
design, fabrication, operation and rehabilitation phases of 
the Demonstration to effectively control or mitigate potentially 
adverse outcomes.
LCK is continuing to work with the South Australian 
regulators, when appropriate, to ensure they are kept 
informed of the project’s progress and have sufficient 
time and resources to effectively manage the 
Demonstration process.
LEIGH CREEK ENERGY PROJECT
Drilling
Drilling operations commenced at the Leigh Creek 
Energy Project Demonstration site during June 2016. The 
drilling program will initially comprise 3 drill holes that will 
collect a variety of important information at the preferred 
Demonstration Facility site. The data collected will include:
•  Baseline environmental samples of rock and water 
including CoPCs within the rock and groundwater.
•  Groundwater properties including porosity, permeability
and the connectivity between the various coal basin strata 
and the surrounding rocks.
•  Rock formation properties including geotechnical
information which will be used to assess the stratas 
stability during gasification and drilling.
•  Coal and overburden samples for detailed gasification
analysis.
The primary objectives of the drilling program are to supply 
environmental baseline, groundwater and rock strength 
data to inform the approvals and engineering design works. 
Additionally, coal and rock samples will be used for additional 
gasification test work. Results of this first stage of drilling are 
expected to be received through to September 2016.
Further drilling to install additional monitoring wells will be 
defined on completion of these initial wells.
Demonstration Facility
LCK has commenced the detailed engineering for the 
gasification Demonstration at the Leigh Creek Energy Project 
site. The Demonstration Facility is focussed on operating 
a single small gasifier to be able to collect gas quality, 
environmental and operational data to inform the Commercial 
Phase design.
The challenge for LCK is to operate the Demonstration 
Facility in a way that safely, quickly and cost effectively 
assures the required environmental and operational 
outcomes. It will be a very small plant, with a limited 
operational life.

LEIGH CREEK ENERGY PROJECT
In Situ Gasification (ISG) Process
What is In Situ Gasification (ISG)?
Whilst ISG technology has been known since the 1800’s, it 
was first adopted commercially in the Soviet Union during the 
1930’s and remains in use there today at the Angren plant 
in Uzbekistan which feeds a power generation plant. Recent 
advances in oil and gas technologies (notably directional 
drilling and computer-based process control) have combined 
to further enhance ISG to become more commercially 
attractive.
The ISG process occurs in deep (generally greater than 
300m) coal seams (in situ). By creating the right process 
conditions (pressure, temperature, presence of oxygen 
or air, and sometimes steam) in the coal seam, a series of 
chemical reactions occur, which results in the gasification of 
the coal. Under this process the solid coal breaks apart into 
its component gases to produce a synthetic gas (syngas). 
ISG syngas is typically comprised of varying amounts of 
hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH4) 
plus other gaseous compounds.
The process is controlled via the injection of air or oxygen 
into the coal seam. These are introduced to the seam via an 
injection well that is drilled vertically and then horizontally 
into the coal seam. The injection well is connected to 
surface facilities including the air, oxygen and steam supply 
equipment.
The syngas is extracted through production wells drilled in 
the coal seam to the surface where the gas is cleaned for use 
in downstream processes or direct sale.
To facilitate flow through the injection well, gasification 
zone and production wells, a “link” needs to be created to 
enhance the in situ permeability of the coal seam. This is best 
achieved by directional drilling which creates a tube shaped 
void along which gases can travel.
While the precise method to be utilised at the LCEP will be 
finalised during the front end engineering design phase of 
the project development work, based on preliminary work, it 
is anticipated that the establishment of the channel between 
the injection well and the production well will be achieved
by drilling a horizontal hole. Later, heating of the coal at 
various locations along the drill hole is likely to utilise the 
Continuous Retraction Injection Point (CRIP) method. This 
method has been proven at several ISG trial sites and is 
widely considered to be the preferred method for efficient 
production of syngas from underground coal seams.
In the CRIP process, the production well is drilled vertically 
and the injection well is drilled using standard oilfield 
directional drilling techniques in order to connect the wells as 
shown in Figure below.
Once the channel is established and the coal heated, a 
gasification cavity is initiated at the end of the oxygen (or 
air) injection well in the horizontal section of the coal seam. 
When the coal near the recently created cavity is consumed, 
the injection point is retracted, and a new gasification cavity 
initiated. In this manner, precise control over the progress of 
the gasification is obtained which leads to a more consistent 
gas composition.
Once brought to the surface via the production wells the 
syngas is first separated and processed and is then available 
for use either:
•  as feedstock for power stations
•
for sale to gas customers (after separation of methane 
from the syngas
•  as ammonium nitrate (for the production of fertiliser and
explosives, or
•
for conversion to liquid fuels.
Standard petroleum and chemical industry plant and 
equipment is used within surface facilities. Coal gasification 
using mined coal has been conducted for over 100 years 
allowing a vast body of knowledge to be developed 
around cleaning and separating syngas produced by coal 
gasification.
The method of processing the syngas will depend upon 
the composition of the gas and the end product that the 
Company ultimately aims to produce.

LEIGH CREEK ENERGY PROJECT
Brief history of ISG 
ISG was first proposed in the 1800’s. The most significant 
development experience has been gained in the former 
Soviet Union commencing in the 1920’s (although interrupted 
by the Second World War). 
Following the discovery of cheap oil and natural gas 
throughout Russia in the 1970’s and 1980’s, the ISG 
development operations were generally scaled back as 
being unnecessary and uneconomic in comparison to the 
abundant cheap natural gas available at the time. 
Following the break-up of the former Soviet Union only 
Kemerovo, in the Kuzbass region of Russia and the 
Yerostigaz station in Angren, Uzbekistan continued to 
operate, each producing up to 4 billion cubic metres of 
syngas per annum. The Kemerovo operation closed in 1996, 
leaving the Yerostigaz operation, located in Angren in Eastern 
Uzbekistan which had commenced its operations in 1961 as 
the only commercially operating ISG operation 
(www.yerostigaz.com). Syngas produced at Angren is used 
to produce electricity for the city of Angren.
ASX Listed Carbon Energy Limited announced on the 
25 July 2016 that it had ‘received formal confirmation from the 
Queensland Government’s Chief Scientist, Dr Geoff Garrett 
AO, that Carbon Energy met the key recommendations of the 
government appointed Independent Scientific Panel (ISP) 
into underground coal gasification.’ Dr Garrett stated ‘ it is 
clear that Carbon Energy has contributed to the collective 
understanding of UCG and the conditions under which the 
operation is likely to be both safe and successful.’
Former Australian Chief Scientist Professor Robin Batterham 
has also noted that Carbon Energy had established ‘a world 
first scientific demonstration of an emerging technology 
from site selection, underground coal gasification with no 
deleterious impact and finally rehabilitation to conditions no 
worst than what existed at the start’.
In conclusion, whilst the ISG technology is proven, it is yet to 
be adopted on a commercial scale in the western economies. 
This gives LCK a distinct first mover advantage and the ability 
to monetise that advantage in the coming years.

30 June 2016.

The Company and subsidiaries are required to comply with 
various Commonwealth and State environmental legislation

Given the nature of the Company’s business as an 
energy development entity and the status of its activities 
during 2016, matters dealt with by the Board dictated no 
efficiencies or other benefits would be gained by having 
separate Audit and Risk Committee meetings on all 
occasions in the period under review. Issues relevant to 
the integrity of the Company’s financial reporting ordinarily 
dealt with by an Audit and Risk Committee were dealt 
with by the full Board when expedient. The Company has 
standing agenda items at each Board meeting to deal with 
audit related matters normally carried out by the Audit 
and Risk Committee. In appropriate circumstances, the 
Board sought independent legal and accounting advice on 
pertinent aspects.
The principal activity of the Group was pursuing the 
development of its Leigh Creek Energy Project.
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS AND OPERATING RESULTS
The consolidated operating loss of the financial year to 30 
June 2016 was $5,366,248 (2015: ($17,598,147) primarily 
as a result of applying reverse acquisition accounting). 
Additionally, expenditure incurred on the project capitalised 
as Exploration expenditure was $1,739,813 (2015: $710,667). 
In relation to cash flow, the stock of treasury shares were 
sold in November 2016 providing $3.4m funds and a share 
capital raising was completed in May 2016 providing a further 
$9.5m (net of capital raising costs) to provide funding for the 
pre-commercial phase.
On 25 September 2015, Leigh Creek Energy and Archer 
Exploration Ltd signed a Heads of Agreement whereby 
Archer will work with the Company to explore synergies on 
their respective Leigh Creek projects in South Australia. No 
amount has been recorded in the accounts at 30 June 2016.
On 15 December 2015, Leigh Creek Energy and APT 
Pipelines Ltd signed a non-binding Heads of Agreement 
which will allow the development of conceptual plans for the 
interconnection of the Leigh Creek Energy Project with the 
east coast gas market. No amount has been recorded in the 
accounts at 30 June 2016.
On 6 April 2016, Leigh Creek Energy and Shanghai Electric 
Power Generation Group signed a Heads of Agreement in 
relation to a future power generation plant located at Leigh 
Creek. No amount has been recorded in the accounts at 
30 June 2016.
DIVIDENDS
The Directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend 
and no amount has been paid or declared since the end of 
the previous financial year.
LIKELY DEVELOPMENTS, PROSPECTS AND BUSINESS 
STRATEGIES
Approval is currently being sought for the pre-commercial 
development phase of the project. Successful completion 
of the pre-commercial phase may likely lead to interest in 
advance transactions over future gas production.
The Group will require further capital to sustain its activities.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Board of Leigh Creek Energy Limited is committed 
to achieving and demonstrating the highest standards 
of corporate governance and has adopted practices and 
policies in accordance with the ASX Corporate Governance 
Recommendations. The Corporate Governance Statement is 
noted on page 26.

During the year ended 30 June 2016, and to the date of this 
report no ordinary shares of Leigh Creek Energy Limited were 
issued on the exercise of options. None of the options on issue 
entitles the holders to participate, by virtue of the options, in 
any dividend or share issue of any other corporation.
INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND INDEMNITY
Since the end of the previous year the Company has paid 
insurance premiums in respect of Directors’ and Officers’ 
liability and legal expenses’ insurance contracts.
The terms of the policies prohibit disclosure of details of 
the amount of insurance cover, the nature thereof and the 
premium paid.
The Company has indemnified the Directors and Executives 
of the Company for the costs incurred in their capacity as a 
director or executive, except where there is a lack of 
good faith.
DIRECTORS’ AND EXECUTIVES’ REMUNERATION – 
AUDITED
a)   Principles used to determine the nature and
amount of remuneration
The remuneration policy is designed to align the 
objectives of the Key Management Personnel with 
shareholder and business objectives by providing a 
fixed remuneration package to non-executive Directors 
and time based remuneration to Executive Directors. 
The Board of Leigh Creek Energy believes the policy to 
be appropriate and effective in attracting and retaining 
the best Directors and Executives to manage and direct 
the Group, as well as create goal congruence between 
Directors, Executives and shareholders.
The Company’s policy for determining the nature and 
amounts of emoluments of board members and other 
Key Management Personnel of the Company is as 
follows.
The Company’s Constitution specifies that the total 
amount of remuneration of non-executive Directors 
shall be fixed from time to time by a general meeting. 
The current maximum aggregate remuneration of 
non-executive Directors has been set at $500,000 
per annum. Directors may apportion any amount up 
to this maximum amount amongst the non-executive 
Directors as they determine. Directors are also entitled 
to be paid reasonable travelling, accommodation and 
other expenses incurred in performing their duties 
as Directors. The remuneration of the Managing 
Director is determined by the non-executive Directors 
and approved by the Board as part of the terms and 
conditions of his employment which are subject to 
review from time to time.
The remuneration of other executive officers and 
employees is determined by the Managing Director 
subject to the approval of the Board.
Non-executive Director remuneration is by way of fees 
and statutory superannuation contributions. Non-
executive Directors do not participate in schemes 
designed for remuneration of executives but they 
may receive options or bonus payments subject 
to shareholder approval and are not provided with 
retirement benefits other than salary sacrifice and 
statutory superannuation.
The Company’s remuneration structure is based on a 
number of factors including the particular experience 
and performance of the individual in meeting key 
objectives of the Company. The Board is responsible for 
assessing relevant employment market conditions and 
achieving the overall, long term, objective of maximising 
shareholder benefits through the retention of high 
quality personnel.
21
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
The Company does not presently emphasise payment for 
results through the provision of cash bonus schemes or other 
incentive payments based on key performance indicators 
of Leigh Creek Energy given the nature of the Company’s 
business as an exploration entity and the current status of its 
activities. However, the Board may approve the payment of 
cash bonuses from time to time in order to reward individual 
executive performance in achieving key objectives as 
considered appropriate by the Board.
The Company also has an Employee Share Option Plan, 
approved by shareholders, that enables the Board to offer 
eligible employees options to acquire ordinary fully paid 
shares in the Company. Under the terms of the Plan, options 
to acquire ordinary fully paid shares may be offered to the 
Company’s eligible employees at no cost unless otherwise 
determined by the Board in accordance with the terms 
and conditions of the Plan. The objective of the Plan is 
to align the interests of employees and shareholders by 
providing employees of the Company with the opportunity 
to participate in the equity of the Company as an incentive to 
achieve greater success for the Company and to maximise 
the long term performance of the Company.
As the Company is developing an energy asset which is not 
yet in production, in the opinion of the Board, the Company’s 
earnings and the consequences of the Company’s 
performance on shareholder wealth are not related to the 
Company’s remuneration policy.
Voting at 2015 AGM
Of the total valid available votes lodged, Leigh Creek Energy 
received 99.91% of “yes” votes on its remuneration report for 
the 2015 financial year with the motion carried unanimously 
on a show of hands as an ordinary resolution. The Company 
did not receive any specific feedback at the AGM on its 
remuneration practices.
Use of remuneration consultants
The Company did not engage remuneration consultants 
during the year.

notional value of the options as at the issue date has been determined in accordance with the accounting policy Note 15.

NOTES
LEIGH CREEK ENERGY LIMITED ABN 31 107 531 822
NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT 
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal activity of the Group was pursuing the 
development of its Leigh Creek Energy Project.
a)   General information and statement of compliance
The consolidated general purpose financial statements 
have been prepared in accordance with the Corporations 
Act 2001, Australian Accounting Standards, including 
Australian Accounting interpretations, other authoritative 
pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards 
Board (AASB). Compliance with Australian Accounting 
Standards ensures that the consolidated financial 
statements and notes of Leigh Creek Energy Limited and 
its controlled entities comply with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS). Leigh Creek Energy is a for-
profit entities for the purposes of preparing the financial 
statements. The financial report has been presented in 
Australian dollars.
The financial report covers Leigh Creek Energy Limited 
and its controlled entities as a consolidated entity 
(“Group”). Leigh Creek Energy Limited is a listed public 
company, incorporated and domiciled in Australia.
The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
30 June 2016 were approved and authorised for issue in 
accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 
15 August 2016.
b)   Overall considerations
The consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared on an accruals basis and are based on 
historical costs modified by the revaluation of selected 
non-current assets, financial assets and financial 
liabilities for which the fair value basis of accounting has 
been applied.
c)   Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the 
Parent Company and all of its subsidiaries as of 30 June 
2016. The Parent controls a subsidiary if it is exposed, or 
has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with 
the subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over the subsidiary. All subsidiaries 
have a report date of 30 June. The controlled entities are 
disclosed in Note 17(a) to the financial statements.
All inter-company balances and transactions between 
entities in the consolidated entity, including any 
unrealised profits or losses, have been eliminated 
on consolidation. Amounts reported in the financial 
statements of subsidiaries have been adjusted where 
necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting 
policies adopted by the Group.
d)   Changes in accounting policy
Recently issued accounting standards to be applied in 
future accounting periods
The accounting standards that have not been early 
adopted for the year ended 30 June 2016, but will be 
applicable to the Group in future reporting periods are 
detailed below. Apart from these standards, we have 
considered other accounting standards that will be 
applicable in future reporting periods, however they have 
been considered insignificant to the Group.
i)  AASB 2014-4 Amendments to Australian Accounting 
Standards – Clarification of Acceptable Methods of 
Depreciation and Amortisation.
The amendments to AASB 116 prohibit the use of 
a revenue-based depreciation method for property, 
plant and equipment. Additionally, the amendments 
provide guidance in the application of the diminishing 
balance method for property, plant and equipment.
The amendments to AASB 138 present a rebuttable 
presumption that a revenue-based amortisation 
method for intangible assets is inappropriate. This 
rebuttable presumption can be overcome (i.e., 
a revenue-based amortisation method might be 
appropriate) only in two (2) limited circumstances:
a. The intangible asset is expressed as a measure 
of revenue, for example when the predominant 
limiting factor inherent in an intangible asset is the 
achievement of a revenue threshold (for instance, 
the right to operate a toll road could be based on a 
fixed total amount of revenue to be generated from 
cumulative tolls charged); or
b. When it can be demonstrated that revenue and 
the consumption of the economic benefits of the 
intangible asset are highly correlated.
When these amendments are first adopted for the
year ending 30 June 2017, there will be no material 
impact on the transactions and balances recognised 
in the financial statements.
ii)   AASB 2015-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting
Standards – Disclosure Initiative: Amendments to 
AASB 101.
The amendments:
-   clarify the materiality requirements in AASB
101, including an emphasis on the potentially 
detrimental effect of obscuring useful information 
with immaterial information
-   clarify that AASB 101’s specified line items
in the statement(s) of profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income and the statement of 
financial position can be disaggregated
34
NOTES
LEIGH CREEK ENERGY LIMITED ABN 31 107 531 822
-   add requirements for how an entity should present 
subtotals in the statement(s) of profit and loss and 
other comprehensive income and the statement of 
financial position
-   clarify that entities have flexibility as to the order in 
which they present the notes, but also emphasise 
that understandability and comparability should be 
considered by an entity when deciding that order
-   remove potentially unhelpful guidance in IAS 1 for
identifying a significant accounting policy.
When these amendments are first adopted for the 
year ending 30 June 2017, there will be no material 
impact on the financial statements.
iii)   AASB 2015-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting
Standards – Disclosure Initiative: Amendments to 
AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements
The Standard makes amendments arising from the 
IASB’s Disclosure Initiative project. The amendments:
•		clarify	the	materiality	requirements	in	AASB
101, including an emphasis on the potentially 
detrimental effect of obscuring useful information

When this standard is first adopted for the year ending
30 June 2017, there will be no material impact on the 
transactions and balances recognised in the financial 
statements.
iv)   AASB 2015-9 Amendments to Australian Accounting
Standards – Scope and Application Paragraphs
This amendment inserts scope paragraphs into 
AASB 8 Operating Segments and AASB 133 Earnings 
per Share in place of application paragraph text in 
AASB 1057.
In July and August 2015, the AASB reissued AASB 
8, AASB 133 and most of the Australian Accounting 
Standards that incorporate IFRSs to make editorial 
changes. The application paragraphs in the 
previous versions of AASB 8 and AASB 133 covered 
scope paragraphs that appear separately in the 
corresponding IFRS 8 and IAS 33. In moving those 
application paragraphs to AASB 1057 when 
AASB 8 and AASB 133 were reissued in August, the 
AASB inadvertently deleted the scope details from 
AASB 8 and AASB 133. This amending Standard puts 
the scope details into those Standards, and removes 
the related text from AASB 1057. There is no change 
to the requirements or the applicability of AASB 8 
and AASB 133.
When this standard is first adopted for the year ending
30 June 2017, there will be no material impact on the 
transactions and balances recognised in the financial 
statements.
v)   AASB 2016-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting
Standards – Disclosure Initiative: Amendments to 
AASB 107
This amendment alters AASB 107 Statement of 
Cash Flows to require entities preparing financial 
statements in accordance with Tier 1 reporting 
requirements to provide disclosures that enable 
users of financial statements to evaluate changes in 
liabilities arising from financing activities, including 
both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash 
changes.
When this standard is first adopted for the year ending
30 June 2018, there will be no material impact on the 
transactions and balances recognised in the financial 
statements.
vi)   AASB 9 Financial Instruments (December 2014)
AASB 9 introduces new requirements for the
classification and measurement of financial 
assets and liabilities. These requirements improve 
and simplify the approach for classification and 
measurement of financial assets compared with the 
requirements of AASB 139. The main changes are:
a)  Financial assets that are debt instruments will be
classified based on: 
 
i)  the objective of the entity’s business model for   
  managing the financial assets; and
ii)  the characteristics of the contractual cash flows.

NOTES
LEIGH CREEK ENERGY LIMITED ABN 31 107 531 822
b)  Allows an irrevocable election on initial recognition
vii)  AASB 2014-7 Amendments to Australian Accounting
to present gains and losses on investments in 
equity instruments that are not held for trading in 
other comprehensive income (instead of in profit 
or loss). Dividends in respect of these investments 
that are a return on investment can be recognised 
in profit or loss and there is no impairment or 
recycling on disposal of the instrument.
c)
Introduces a ‘fair value through other 
comprehensive income’ measurement category for 
particular simple debt instruments.
d)  Financial assets can be designated and
measured at fair value through profit or loss 
at initial recognition if doing so eliminates or 
significantly reduces a measurement or recognition 
inconsistency that would arise from measuring 
assets or liabilities, or recognising the gains and 
losses on them, on different bases.
e)  Where the fair value option is used for financial
liabilities the change in fair value is to be accounted 
for as follows:
-
-
the change attributable to changes in credit 
risk are presented in Other Comprehensive  
Income (‘OCI’)
the remaining change is presented in profit 
or loss
If this approach creates or enlarges an accounting 
mismatch in the profit or loss, the effect of the 
changes in credit risk are also presented in profit 
or loss.
Otherwise, the following requirements have
generally been carried forward unchanged from 
AASB 139 into AASB 9:
-   classification and measurement of financial
liabilities; and
-   derecognition requirements for financial assets
and liabilities.
AASB 9 requirements regarding hedge accounting
represent a substantial overhaul of hedge accounting 
that enable entities to better reflect their risk 
management activities in the financial statements. 
Furthermore, AASB 9 introduces a new impairment 
model based on expected credit losses. This model 
makes use of more forward-looking information and 
applies to all financial instruments that are subject to 
impairment accounting.
When this standard is first adopted for the year ending
30 June 2019, there will be no material impact on the 
transactions and balances recognised in the financial 
statements.

from the issuance of AASB 9 (refer (i) above).

transactions and balances recognised in the financial 
statements.

determined.
ix)   AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
•		 replaces	AASB	118	Revenue,	AASB	111

  ending 30 June 2019, the impact has not yet been  
  determined.
There are no other standards that are not yet effective 
and that are expected to have a material impact on 
the entity in the current or future reporting periods and 
on foreseeable future transactions.

e)   Impairment of Assets
At each reporting date, the group reviews the carrying 
values of its assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have been impaired. If such 
an indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset, 
being the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to 
sell and value in use, is compared to the asset’s carrying 
value. Any excess of the asset’s carrying value over its 
recoverable amount is expensed to the statement of 
profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Where 
it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of 
an individual asset, the group estimates the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit to which the 
asset belongs.
f)   Segment reporting
The Board has considered the requirements of AASB 
8 Operating Segments and the internal reports that are 
reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (the 
Board) in allocating resources and has concluded at this 
time that there are no separately identifiable.
g)   Goods and Services Tax (GST)
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net 
of the amount of GST, unless the GST incurred is not 
recoverable from the Australian Tax Office. In this case 
it is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the 
asset or as part of the expense.
Receivables and payables in the statement of financial 
position are shown inclusive of GST. The net amount 
of GST recoverable from the Australian Tax Office is 
included with other receivables in the statement of 
financial position.
Cash flows are presented in the cash flow statement on a 
GST inclusive basis.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, 
seldom equal the related actual results. The areas 
involving significant estimates and assumptions are 
listed below:
•		 Exploration	and	Evaluation	Expenditure	–	Note	7 	
Judgement is required to ensure that the carrying 
value of Exploration and Evaluation assets does not 
exceed the recoverable amount. Factors considered 
in this judgement are:
a)  the period for which the entity has the right to 
explore in the specific area has expired or will 
expire in the near future;
b)  substantive expenditure on further exploration for
and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific 
area is neither budgeted nor planned;
c)  exploration for and evaluation of mineral
resources in the specific area have not led to the 
discovery of commercially viable quantities of 
mineral resources and the entity has decided to 
discontinue such activities;
d)  sufficient data exists to indicate that, although 
a development in the specific area is likely to 
proceed, the carrying amount of the exploration 
and evaluation asset is unlikely to be recovered 
in full from successful development or by sale. 
Management has made a judgement that, given 
these factors, the balance of Exploration and 
Evaluation assets is not impaired.
•		 Share	based	payments	–	Note	15
The valuation for accounting purposes of Share 
Based Payments relies on a number of factors that 
cannot be accurately measured. These include:
a)  the volatility of the LCK share value;
h)   Comparative Figures
b)  the probability that vesting conditions/milestones
Unless otherwise required by an accounting standard 
comparative information is disclosed in respect of the 
previous corresponding period, including for narrative 
and descriptive information. To the extent that items 
are amended or reclassified comparative amounts are 
also amended or reclassified. Prior period errors are 
retrospectively corrected in the next financial report 
following discovery.
i)  Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments
The Directors evaluate estimates and judgments 
incorporated into the financial report based on historical 
knowledge and best available current information. 
Estimates assume a reasonable expectation of future 
events and are based on current trends and economic 
data, obtained both externally and within the Group.
will be met;
c)  the probability that the employee will remain
employed with the company until the expiry date 
of the options;
d)  the probability that the employee will exercise 
their options. Final judgement about vesting of 
the options is retained by the Board. Management 
has assessed each of these factors and made 
judgements on what factors are used for the 
calculation.

Deferred taxes are not recognised in the accounts. As the Group has significant carried forward tax losses, it does not have 
sufficient taxable temporary differences which will result in taxable amounts against which the unused tax losses can be 
utilised.
The amount of benefits which may be realised in the future is based on the assumption that no adverse change will occur 
in income taxation legislation and the anticipation that the economic entity will derive sufficient future assessable income to 
enable the benefit to be realised and comply with the condition of deductibility imposed by the law.

NOTE 6: PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Accounting policy – property, plant and equipment
Each class of property, plant and equipment is carried at cost, where applicable, less any accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses.
i)   Plant and equipment
Plant and equipment are shown at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment. Cost 
includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets.
The carrying amount of plant and equipment is reviewed annually to ensure it is not in excess of the recoverable amount 
from these assets. The recoverable amount is assessed on the basis of the expected net cash flows that will be received 
from the asset’s employment and subsequent disposal. The expected net cash flows have been discounted to their 
present values in determining recoverable amounts.
ii)   Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
•		 Plant	and	equipment	5-33%
•		 Office	equipment	10-50%
•		 Motor	vehicles	15%
•		 Leasehold	improvement	45%
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date. Gains and 
losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined as the difference between the disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the assets (including impairment provision) and are recognised in the profit or loss with Other Income or 
Other Expenses.

NOTE 7: EXPLORATION AND EVALUATION EXPENDITURE
Accounting policy – exploration and evaluation expenditure
Exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred is accumulated in respect of each identifiable area of interest. These costs are only 
carried forward to the extent that right of tenure is current and those costs are expected to be recouped through the successful 
development of the area (or, alternatively by its sale) or where activities in the area have not yet reached a stage which permits 
reasonable assessment of the existence of economically recoverable reserves and operations in relation to the area are continuing.
When production commences, the accumulated costs for the relevant area of interest are amortised over the life of the area 
according to the rate of depletion of the economically recoverable reserves.
Accumulated costs, in relation to an abandoned area, are written off in full against profit in the period in which the decision to 
abandon the area is made.

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares is shown in equity as a 
deduction from the proceeds.
The company has granted unlisted options to employees in respect of their employment contracts. The fair value of the options 
granted is recognised as an employee benefits expense with a corresponding increase in equity (Share Option Reserve). The fair 
value is measured at grant date and recognised over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to 
exercise the option. Fair value is determined by the use of a Trinomial option pricing model.
On 9 May 2016, the Company announced that a capital raising had been completed by a private placement of 35,374,969 new

NOTES
NOTE 14: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Accounting policy – Financial instruments
Recognition
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions 
of the financial instrument, and are measured initially at fair value adjusted by transactions costs, except for those 
carried at fair value through profit or loss, which are measured initially at fair value. Subsequent measurement of 
financial assets and financial liabilities are described below.
Classification and subsequent measurement
i)  Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL)
Financial assets at FVTPL include financial assets that are either classified as held for trading or that meet certain 
conditions and are designated at FVTPL upon initial recognition. Assets in this category are measured at fair 
value with gains or losses recognised in profit or loss. The fair values of financial assets in this category are 
determined by reference to active market transactions.
ii)   Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted 
in an active market and are stated at amortised cost.
Derecognition
Financial assets are derecognised where the contractual rights to receipt of cash flows expires or the asset is 
transferred to another party whereby the entity no longer has any significant continuing involvement in the risks 
and benefits associated with the asset. Financial liabilities are derecognised where the related obligations are either 
discharged, cancelled or expire. The difference between the carrying value of the financial liability extinguished or 
transferred to another party and the fair value of consideration paid, including the transfer of non-cash assets or 
liabilities assumed, is recognised in the profit or loss.
Impairment
At each reporting date, the group assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial instrument has been 
impaired. In the case of available-for-sale financial instruments, a prolonged decline in the value of the instrument is 
considered to determine whether impairment has arisen. Impairment losses are recognised in the profit or loss.
a)   Financial Risk Management
The Group’s financial instruments consist mainly of deposits with banks, short-term investments, accounts 
receivables and payable which are summarised as follows:
Floating interest at call
Non-interest bearing

NOTES
NOTE 14: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continues
The group does not hold any derivative instruments.
i)  Treasury Risk Management
The risk management of treasury functions is managed by the Board. No efficiencies or other benefits would be 
gained by having a separate finance committee.
ii)   Finance Risks
The Group’s financial instruments are exposed to a variety of financial risks, being Market risk (Interest rate and 
Price risk), Credit risk and Liquidity risk. The Group operates mainly in Australia and as such is not subject to 
foreign exchange risk.
Interest rate risk 
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk, which is the risk that a financial instrument’s value will fluctuate as a 
result of changes in market interest rates on classes of financial assets and liabilities, is summarised in the table 
above. As the Group does not have any bank borrowings the interest rate risk is considered to be minimal.
Sensitivity: At June 30, 2016, if interest rates had changed by -/+ 10 basis points from the year end rates with all 
other variables held constant post tax loss and total equity would have been $754 more/less as a result of lower/
higher interest income from term deposits.
Price risk 
Price risk relates to the risk that the fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
prices largely due to market forces. The Group’s available-for-sale financial assets and fair value through profit 
and loss financial assets are subject to price risk. Investments within these two categories of financial assets are 
publicly traded on the ASX.
Credit risk 
Exposure to credit risk relating to financial assets arises from the potential non-performance by counterparties of 
contract obligation that could lead to a financial loss to the Group. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk 
is its cash and cash equivalents and receivables as noted in the table above. The group manages its credit risk 
by depositing with reputable licenced banks.
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that the Group might encounter difficulty in settling its debts or otherwise 
meeting its obligations related to financial liabilities. The Group manages liquidity risk by monitoring forecast cash 
flows and ensuring that adequate sources of funding are available.
Maturity of the group’s financial liabilities is within 1 year.
NOTE 15: SHARE BASED PAYMENT PLANS
Accounting policy – share based payment plans
Share based compensation benefits are provided to employees of the Company. The fair value of the options 
granted under the plan is recognised as an employee benefit expense with a corresponding increase in equity 
(Share Option Reserve). The fair value is measured at grant date and recognised over the period during which the 
employees become entitled to the underlying shares.
The fair value at issue date is calculated using the Trinomial option pricing model that takes into account the 
share price at issue date, the exercise price, the term until expiry, estimate of implied volatility, the vesting and 
performance criteria and the non-tradeable nature of the option. At each balance sheet date, the Company revises 
its estimate of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.

INDEPENDENT AUDIT REPORT

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether 
due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the 
Company’s preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing 
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. An audit also includes 
evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates made by the Directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial 
report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our audit opinion.
Independence 
In conducting our audit, we have complied with the independence requirements of the 
Corporations Act 2001.
Auditor’s opinion 
In our opinion:
