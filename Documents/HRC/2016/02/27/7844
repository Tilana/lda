<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 20/20, the Human Rights Council expressed deep concern at the 
ongoing reports of grave violations of human rights by the Eritrean authorities against their 
own population and fellow citizens, and decided to appoint a special rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in Eritrea for a period of one year. The Council requested the 
Special Rapporteur to submit a report at its twenty-third session. It also called upon the 
Government of Eritrea to cooperate fully with the Special Rapporteur, to permit access to 
visit the country and to provide the information necessary for the fulfilment of the mandate. 
The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Eritrea took up her mandate on 
1 November 2012. 
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 21/1, the Human Rights Council decided that documentation 
considered by the Council under its complaint procedure relating to the situation of human 
rights in Eritrea should be transmitted to the Special Rapporteur. The Council invited the 
Special Rapporteur to investigate further the allegations contained in the submitted 
complaints and the circumstances of the individuals mentioned in the submitted 
communications and to report thereon to the Council at its twenty-third session. 
</p>
<p>3. The present report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council 
resolutions 20/20 and 21/1, and is based upon the initial observations made by the Special 
Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Approach to the mandate 
</b></p>
<p>4. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, the mandate offers the potential for Eritrea to 
be closely involved in efforts to ensure that long-lasting solutions compliant with 
international standards are found for the respect and observance of human rights in the 
country, a message that she reiterated in her meetings with all interlocutors, including 
Eritrean officials.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur endeavoured to implement the mandate in a constructive, 
transparent, independent and impartial manner, aiming at contributing to strengthening the 
respect for the human rights of all Eritreans.  
</p>
<p>6. Despite the lack of access to Eritrea, as well as other obstacles and challenges, the 
Special Rapporteur reached out to a broad range of stakeholders in the preparation of the 
present report. In the implementation of her mandate, she is committed to giving a voice to 
Eritreans who have experienced violations directly or indirectly and whose fundamental 
freedoms and human rights have been breached.  
</p>
<p>7. The approach adopted by the Special Rapporteur was prudently optimistic, in that 
she refused to be daunted by the non-cooperation of the Government of Eritrea with the 
mandate and the difficulties in obtaining information from and about Eritrea. She has also 
endeavoured to make the mandate firm and bold, addressing squarely the issues that were 
raised by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 20/20. Lastly, the Special Rapporteur 
views the mandate as incremental, setting down the foundations and then the building 
blocks aiming at the full respect of international human rights law, with each small step 
being celebrated as an achievement. In her concluding remarks, the Special Rapporteur 
identifies specific areas to be addressed in the medium term, as well as recommendations 
for the Government of Eritrea and the international community. </p>


<p><b> III. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>8. Since the appointment of the Special Rapporteur, she has repeatedly expressed her 
wish to engage with the Government of Eritrea. In December 2012, she wrote to the 
President of Eritrea, explaining her intention to be guided by the international human rights 
norms and standards to which Eritrea is a party in the implementation of her mandate. In 
the hope that the Government of Eritrea would seize the opportunity to engage in a fresh 
and constructive dialogue on human rights issues brought to the fore by an array of 
stakeholders, the Special Rapporteur requested to visit Eritrea for consultations with 
relevant officials from the Government as well as a range of actors. Her aim was to assess 
the human rights situation on the ground first-hand and to explore jointly future avenues for 
the protection and promotion of human rights in the country. At the time of writing, a reply 
to her request was still pending. 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur welcomed the opportunity of a meeting with a 
representative of the Government of Eritrea in Geneva in January 2013, during which she 
reiterated her request to be allowed access to the country. In addition, she met with the 
delegation of Eritrea attending the fifty-third ordinary session of the African Commission 
on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights in Banjul, on 10 April 2013, where she reiterated her 
request for an invitation to visit Eritrea. Again, she regrets to report that, at the time of 
writing, the Government of Eritrea had not responded to her requests.  
</p>
<p>10. Owing to the lack of access, the Special Rapporteur decided to collect first-hand 
information from Eritreans who had recently left the country with a view to inform her 
assessment of the situation of human rights in Eritrea, by means of interviews with victims 
of human rights violations. Initially, she submitted visit requests to all neighbouring 
countries with a sizable Eritrean refugee population. Of the 11 requests sent, three positive 
responses were obtained, two Governments responded negatively and six Governments 
have not yet replied. 
</p>
<p>11. In view of the pressing deadlines for submission of the present report and the 
challenges faced in obtaining first-hand information, the Special Rapporteur accepted the 
invitations granted by the Governments of Djibouti and of Ethiopia to interview Eritrean 
refugees on their territory.  
</p>
<p>12. A positive reply from an additional country was much appreciated; however, as it 
was received when other arrangements had already been made, the Special Rapporteur 
would like to explore the possibility of rescheduling a visit at a later date. She also 
addressed a request to visit one European country to meet with the Eritrean diaspora there, 
a request that will be explored for a future report.  
</p>
<p>13. From 30 April to 9 May 2013, the Special Rapporteur carried out a mission to 
Djibouti and Ethiopia. In Ethiopia, she visited the main reception centre administered by 
the Administration for Refugee and Returnee Affairs in Endabaguna, and the Adi-Harush 
and Mai-Aini refugee camps in the Tigray region. In Djibouti, she met with urban refugees 
and those based in the Ali Addeh refugee camp, as well as military deserters detained at the 
Nagad Police Academy. The Special Rapporteur paid courtesy calls to the authorities in 
both countries. She would like to thank the Governments of Djibouti and of Ethiopia for 
their invitation and the cooperation and flexibility shown during her visit to their countries.  
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur also participated in the fifty-third ordinary session of the 
African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights in Banjul, from 9 to 12 April 2013. 
She was able to present her vision of and approach to the mandate during a briefing with 
the members of the Commission. While in Banjul, she also addressed the NGO Forum 
preceding the session, and was invited to attend a side event, held on 10 April 2013, on the </p>


<p>situation of human rights in Eritrea organized by human rights defenders. Interaction in 
Banjul was useful for the collection of information from various stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>15. The present report was also based on information gathered from a variety of other 
sources, including governmental, non-governmental and intergovernmental sources. The 
information contained in the submissions forwarded to the Special Rapporteur pursuant to 
Human Rights Council resolution 21/1 was also an important source. The Special 
Rapporteur held meetings with a broad range of actors, such as government representatives, 
human rights defenders, civil society representatives and academics.  
</p>
<p>16. In addition, the Special Rapporteur developed a questionnaire aimed at gathering 
information about allegations of specific human rights violations in Eritrea. The 
questionnaire was uploaded to the website of the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, and is available as a tool for those who wish to inform 
the Special Rapporteur about specific human rights violations. Since the beginning of April 
2013, she has received more than 200 e-mails and letters with requests for meetings, mainly 
from Eritreans in the diaspora in Europe, Canada and the United States of America. The 
Special Rapporteur continues to encourage those requesting meetings to provide written 
submissions. She expresses her gratitude to all interlocutors for their support in the 
implementation of her mandate. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Overall context 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Overview of historical, political and economic contexts 
</b></p>
<p>17. Eritrea declared its de jure independence in 1993 after 30 years of liberation struggle 
against Ethiopian rule and following a referendum monitored by the United Nations, in 
which Eritreans voted overwhelmingly (more than 98 per cent) for independence. The 
country occupies a significant geostrategic space in eastern Africa. Located along the Red 
Sea coastline, just north of the Horn of Africa, it consists of a central plateau referred to as 
the highlands and the lowlands in the north, west and along the coast.  
</p>
<p>18. The Eritrean People&#8217;s Liberation Front (EPLF) took control of Eritrea in 1991 and 
issued proclamation 23/1992 the following year, in which it recognized its obligation to 
establish a transitional Government while awaiting the formation of a constitutional 
Government. Proclamation 37/1993 restricted the duration of the tenure of the transitional 
Government to four years. The EPLF has, however, remained in power, in the form of the 
Popular Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ), with the structure established by 
proclamation 37/1993. 
</p>
<p>19. Since independence, the PDFJ has remained the only legal political party in Eritrea. 
Political space is restricted and limited, with no alternative voice allowed. The Constitution, 
which was ratified in 1997 by the Constituent Assembly but never formally implemented, 
provides for an elected legislature with the power to choose a President from among its 
members by a majority vote. To date, however, no national elections have been held and 
President Isaias Afwerki has remained in office since independence. 
</p>
<p>20. Reliable and up-to-date data on the Eritrean economy are difficult to obtain. The 
United Nations Development Fund (UNDP) has classified the human development index of 
Eritrea at 0.351, ranking the country at 181st of 187 countries with comparable data. 
Furthermore, UNDP indicates that the index for sub-Saharan Africa as a region has risen 
from 0.366 in 1980 to 0.475, placing Eritrea below the regional average. Military 
expenditure, including the huge costs of military mobilization, is one major factor 
contributing to the country&#8217;s economic decline. </p>


<p>21. With regard to the Millennium Development Goals, Eritrea is reportedly poised to 
meet six of the eight Goals, namely Goals 2 to 7 (regarding universal primary education, 
the promotion of gender equality and empowerment of women, the reduction of child 
mortality, improvement in maternal health, combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other 
diseases, and ensuring environmental sustainability). Eritrea is not on track with regard to 
Goals 1 (on the eradication of extreme hunger and poverty) and 8 (developing a global 
partnership for development).  
</p>
<p>22. Based on its rigorous national policy of self-reliance, the Government of Eritrea 
restricts humanitarian and development assistance by international actors. To support 
development efforts, the United Nations country team signed the four-year Strategic 
Partnership Cooperation Framework for 2013-2016 with the Government.1 The Framework 
focuses on five strategic areas for intervention and cooperation: (a) basic social services; (b) 
national capacity development; (c) food security and sustainable livelihood; (d) 
environmental sustainability; and (e) gender equity and the advancement of women.  
</p>
<p><b> B. International and regional context  
</b></p>
<p>23. Eritrea and some of its immediate neighbours (Djibouti, Ethiopia, the Sudan and 
Yemen) have had troubled relations over border issues. While some issues have been 
resolved, others persist, spawning a set of circumstances qualified by the Eritrean 
authorities as a &#8220;no war no peace&#8221; state of affairs. A case in point was the war of 1998-2000 
with Ethiopia, and the non-implementation of the ruling issued by the Eritrea-Ethiopia 
Boundary Commission in 2002. These unresolved issues contribute to the country&#8217;s 
regional and international isolation, its internal political situation and, more importantly, it 
has a negative impact on the enjoyment of human rights in the country. The State&#8217;s foreign 
and security policy should be viewed historically and in the context of these unresolved 
border issues.  
</p>
<p>24. Since 2009, the Security Council has adopted a number of key resolutions regarding 
Eritrea: resolution 1862 (2009), on the country&#8217;s border dispute with Djibouti; resolution 
1907 (2009), in which the Council imposed a targeted sanctions regime, including an arms 
embargo on both imports and exports, on Eritrea for its failure to comply with resolution 
1862 (2009); and resolution 2033 (2011), in which the Council expanded restrictive 
measures in the area of the diaspora taxes and the State&#8217;s mining sector and financial 
services. 
</p>
<p>25. In an attempt to strengthen its regional engagement, in 2011, Eritrea reopened its 
mission to the African Union, which had been closed after the outbreak of the conflict with 
Ethiopia. Eritrea is also seeking re-admission to the Intergovernmental Authority on 
Development (IGAD). Furthermore, since 2012 it has resumed attending the ordinary 
sessions of the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. All these initiatives 
may be construed as efforts to end a largely self-imposed isolation. 
</p>
<p>26. While acknowledging the seriousness of border issues, it is the humble view of the 
Special Rapporteur that these should not serve as an excuse for the appalling human rights 
situation in Eritrea, which in one way or another touches the life of almost every family. 
Most Eritreans that the Special Rapporteur met reported that there is no family in the 
country that has not known death, arrest, detention or exile.

<p><b> C. Cooperation with human rights mechanisms  
</b></p>
<p>27. Eritrea has a mixed record of engagement with United Nations and African Union 
human rights mechanisms. It has ratified and/or acceded to a significant number of 
international human rights instruments, namely the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the 
Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child.  
</p>
<p>28. The core treaties to which Eritrea is not a party include the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families, the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>29. Eritrea participated actively in the sixth session of the universal periodic review, in 
November 2009. A high-level delegation from Eritrea attended the session in Geneva and 
provided responses to the 131 recommendations in writing prior to the consideration of the 
review outcome by the Human Rights Council at its in thirteenth session, in March 2010, 
accepting almost 50 per cent of all recommendations made. The Government has reportedly 
taken steps for follow-up to the review, including by sending all recommendations made at 
its review to relevant ministries, calling for their implementation, while the United Nations 
country team is engaging with the Government with regard to follow-up.  
</p>
<p>30. Eritrea is due to undergo its second universal periodic review in January 2014, an 
opportune platform to engage positively on the situation of human rights and for the 
country to illustrate the concrete steps that it has taken to improve its human rights record.  
</p>
<p>31. Eritrea has not issued a standing invitation and has not agreed to any of the pending 
visit requests made by five special procedures mandate holders of the Human Rights 
Council. These include the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression (invitation requested in 2003, renewed in 2005); the 
Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief (2004); the Special Rapporteur on the 
right to food (2003); the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment (2005, 2007 and 2010); and the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions (2010). 
</p>
<p>32. Eritrea is a party to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the 
African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, both ratified in 1999. In 2003, the 
African Commission made a pronouncement on the case of 11 former officials of the 
Government of Eritrea detained in 2011, stating that Eritrea had violated articles 2 (freedom 
from discrimination), 6 (right to personal liberty and protection from arbitrary arrest), 7(1) 
(right to have one&#8217;s cause heard) and 9(2) (right to express and disseminate one&#8217;s opinion 
within the law) of the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. The Commission 
urged the Government to release immediately and to compensate the detainees. Also in 
2007, the African Commission reviewed the case of 18 journalists detained without trial 
since 2001. It ruled that Eritrea was violating articles 1 (obligations of Member States), 5 
(prohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment), 6 (right to personal 
liberty and protection from arbitrary arrest), 7(1) (right to have one&#8217;s cause heard), 9 (right 
to information and free expression) and 18 (protection of the family and vulnerable groups) 
of the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. The Commission called for a fair 
trial for the detainees and called on the Government to lift the ban on freedom of the press. 
Eritrea has yet to implement either ruling.  </p>


<p>33. Recommendations by the United Nations and African Union human rights 
mechanisms were taken into account in the preparation of the present report. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Brief comments on the rule of law 
</b></p>
<p>34. The all-encompassing definition of the rule of law given in the report of the 
Secretary-General on the rule of law and transitional justice in conflict and post-conflict 
societies was taken as a basis to enquire about the rule of law in Eritrea. 2 
</p>
<p>35. The basic tenets of the rule of law are not respected in Eritrea owing to a centralized 
system of Government where decision-making powers are concentrated in the hands of the 
President and his close collaborators. The separation of powers among the various arms of 
the State is inexistent. The failure to implement the Constitution adopted in 1997 is another 
reason for the breakdown of the rule of law, although there are other contributory factors, 
such as arbitrariness, lack of transparency and accountability, all of which have a negative 
impact on the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms.  
</p>
<p>36. A constitutional commission was established by proclamation 55/1994 in March 
1994. Following broad consultations, public debate and drafting, the National Assembly 
ratified the Constitution in 1997. A brief document apparently destined to evolve with time, 
it provides for the separation of powers, with checks and balances, the independence of 
institutions, including of the judiciary, and human rights guarantees. As the fundamental 
law<i>,</i> the Constitution is based on democratic principles and has the authority to declare 
invalid any law or proclamation inconsistent with it. 
</p>
<p>37. The Constitution was meant to come into effect following the National Assembly 
elections, scheduled for 1997. The elections were, however, postponed indefinitely; Eritrea 
therefore continues to operate on pre-constitutional transitional powers. In the addendum to 
the report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, the State under review 
remarked that the Constitution was &#8220;the supreme law of the land&#8221;, and that the Government 
was implementing it, &#8220;including the holding of democratic elections at the local, 
subregional and regional levels&#8221;. Some of the institutions provided for in the Constitution 
had &#8220;yet to be constituted&#8221;. The representative added that national elections would be held 
&#8220;once the threat to national security and the country&#8217;s sovereignty is irrevocably removed&#8221;.3 
</p>
<p>38. Even though the Constitution includes a Bill of Rights (chap. three), the Government 
of Eritrea continues to systematically violate these very fundamental rights. Systematic 
human rights violations stem from the absence of due process and a lack of credible 
institutions through which affected individuals can take their complaints to be examined 
and have their rights upheld. Attempts have also been made to silence dissent over the 
failure to -implement the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>39. Legislative functions accorded to the National Assembly by the unimplemented 
Constitution have been assumed entirely by the Government. The Ministry of Justice drafts 
and publishes laws in collaboration with other relevant ministries and the Office of the 
President; Eritrea is thus a country ruled by decree. The National Assembly has not 
convened since 2002. 
</p>
<p>40. Despite the guarantee regarding the independence of the judiciary stipulated in 
article 7 of proclamation 37/1993, which provides for the structure, powers and 
responsibilities of the Government of Eritrea, the court system is weak and prone to 
</p>
<p>  
 2  S/2004/616, para. 6. 
 3 A/HRC/13/2/Add.1, para. 11. </p>


<p>interference. In July 2001, the Chief Judge of the High Court was removed from office after 
having expressed his disapproval of executive interference in judicial proceedings and 
called for the dismantling of the Special Court. The Special Court has jurisdiction over 
cases involving corruption and related crimes; its decisions are final. It has the power to re-
open and adjudicate cases already processed through the regular criminal justice system, 
disregarding the basic principle of protection from double jeopardy and other fair trial 
guarantees. A high percentage of those serving in the Special Court do not have formal 
legal training and are not bound to apply prevailing laws. Civil courts comprise the 
community court, the Zoba Court and the High Court. The Military Court has jurisdiction 
over penal cases brought against members of the armed forces. 
</p>
<p>41. The Constitution, supporting laws and adherence to international conventions have 
no enforceable value as long as the authorities do not implement them in practice. Most 
governmental functions, including the creation of courts, are conducted on a de facto rather 
than a de jure basis, thereby completely undermining the rule of law. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Human rights violations 
</b></p>
<p>42. In accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 20/20, in which the Council 
cited widespread and systematic violations of human rights in Eritrea, the Special 
Rapporteur endeavoured to corroborate patterns of human rights violations through the 
collection of first-hand testimonies and interviews. According to the information collected, 
human rights violations committed in Eritrea include, but are not limited to, extrajudicial 
killings; the ruthless implementation of a shoot-to-kill policy of persons attempting to cross 
borders; enforced disappearances and incommunicado detention; arbitrary arrests and 
detentions; widespread torture, both physical and psychological, during interrogation by the 
police, military and security forces; inhumane prison conditions;<b> </b>compulsory national 
service of an unspecified and extended duration; no respect for civil liberties, including the 
freedoms of expression and opinion, assembly, association, religious belief and movement; 
discrimination against women, and sexual and gender-based violence; violation of child 
rights, including conscription, which has a profound impact on education; and precarious 
living conditions. These violations were cited as reasons pushing a constant stream of 
Eritreans to cross the borders. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Right to life, extrajudicial killings, the shoot-to-kill policy, and death in 
</b></p>
<p><b>custody 
</b></p>
<p>43. An unknown number of people have been shot near the Eritrean borders with 
Djibouti, Ethiopia and the Sudan, allegedly for attempting to cross illegally. Border military 
personnel have standing orders to implement a shoot-to-kill policy to those attempting to 
flee. The policy was confirmed in the discussions and interviews held by the Special 
Rapporteur with several former military personnel who had been required to implement it, 
as well as with those who had been victims of the practice. The account of a young woman 
who was shot while crossing the border in 2012 was particularly harrowing. After her first 
attempt to cross failed, she was imprisoned at Sawa detention centre for almost a year, 
without her family being informed. When she attempted to cross the border again, she was 
shot seven times, in the leg, foot, hand and breast, but still managed to escape. She had to 
be hospitalized for nine months. 
</p>
<p>44. Owing to the harsh conditions at the Sawa military training camp, students commit 
suicide or fall ill and die. In one year, two girls died. For having failed to clean the 
bathroom, a female student was punished by being forced to roll on the hot ground, thus 
sustaining severe burns to her body. Unable to bear the pain, she leaned on a live electric </p>


<p>wire and was electrocuted. Her friend, who was trying to rescue her, also died. When 
students die in Sawa, their bodies are buried in a graveyard with no tombstones. Parents are 
rarely informed about the death of a child.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Enforced disappearances and incommunicado detention 
</b></p>
<p>45. Relatives of those who are arrested and detained are rarely informed, but tend to find 
out by chance through other detainees who have been released. In addition, Eritrean 
nationals who are repatriated after a failed refugee or asylum application usually disappear 
upon their return. The practice of enforced disappearance is used to intimidate people, to 
install a climate of fear and to deter people from claiming their rights.  
</p>
<p>46. While unknown numbers of Eritreans have disappeared, the most prominent cases 
include 11 political leaders, members of the &#8220;G-15&#8221;, and 10 journalists, all of whom were 
arrested in 2001. To date, the Government has refused to provide any information on their 
fate.  
</p>
<p>47. The reluctance to give any indication about the above group and about the thousands 
of others who have disappeared is distressing, and points to a total disregard for the 
principle of accountability and respect for international human rights law. The Government 
of Eritrea needs to tell family members and the international community whether they are 
still alive. In the meetings of the Special Rapporteur with Eritrean delegates, she 
endeavoured to ask, where (if the answer was yes) these persons were and about their 
current state of health. She asked whether they had access to medical care, if needed. 
Families should be allowed to meet them. In addition, she asked why, after 12 years, they 
had not been brought before an independent court of law to be charged with a crime 
recognized under international law. To date, the Special Rapporteur has not received any 
answer to her questions.  
</p>
<p>48. There have been thousands of victims of enforced disappearance or incommunicado 
detention in Eritrea. There are those who disappeared at one point in time and subsequently 
reappeared with stories of incommunicado incarceration and torture or who remain silent 
because of threats to their lives or their family if they were to speak. There are those who 
never return and about whom nothing is ever heard. And there are those who disappear and 
whose dead bodies are returned. The consequences of the absence of the disappeared 
person can have a serious impact on the whole family, with women and children bearing 
the brunt because of their vulnerable situations.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Arbitrary arrest and detention, torture and prison conditions 
</b></p>
<p>49. Government officials, zonal administrators, community and religious leaders, 
businesspeople, journalists and teachers, as well as ordinary citizens expressing critical 
views or posing questions, have been jailed for explicit or inferred opposition to the 
Government or its policies. Mere suspicion appears to be enough for somebody to be 
subjected to interrogation and detention without charge or without being brought before a 
court of law. The number of Eritreans jailed for their perceived political opposition is 
difficult to confirm, but may be as high as 10,000.4 They are often held indefinitely without 
access to family members or lawyers, and there are no court appearances or public trials. 
</p>
<p>50. From several accounts, it would appear that the modus operandi adopted involves 
detainees being arrested at night, or kidnapped, blindfolded and driven around before being 
</p>
<p>  
 4 A/HRC/WG.6/6/ERI/3, para. 15. </p>


<p>subjected to interrogation by agents in civilian clothes. They are either dumped in a cell in 
an underground prison or in another secret place of detention. They do not know where 
they have been taken to (nor do their families), and are too afraid to ask. They are removed 
from their places of detention for interrogation at regular intervals. The identities of 
interrogators are kept secret, as they shroud their faces. 
</p>
<p>51. The number of people arrested and detained without charge or due process amounts 
to thousands. National service evaders or escapees, and those suspected of wanting to flee 
or caught during flight further swell detention figures and may reach tens of thousands.  
</p>
<p>52. Invariably, detainees are held without being informed about the reason for their 
arrest and without an arrest warrant. Prison conditions are life threatening, harsh, degrading 
and unhygienic. Food rations are generally poor, and the nutritional value and quality of the 
food and water supplies provided to detainees are inadequate. Those in underground prisons 
do not see daylight for months at a time. 
</p>
<p>53. Individuals arrested arbitrarily are subjected to physical and psychological torture, 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. The information gathered confirmed that torture is 
regularly used in Eritrean prisons, military barracks and at Sawa &#8211; a one-stop service 
consisting of a school, a military training camp and a detention facility all in one, as well as 
other military training camps.  
</p>
<p>54. Political prisoners, other detainees, military deserters, &#8220;refouled&#8221; refugees, failed 
asylum seekers and students at Sawa are subjected to torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading 
treatment or punishment. Detainees are particularly vulnerable to abuse, as they are held 
incommunicado, without legal procedures or safeguards, while access by family, doctors or 
lawyers is denied, in blatant disregard for international human rights standards. Perpetrators 
are not prosecuted or punished, thus perpetuating a culture of impunity. 
</p>
<p>55. Former detainees described various types of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment inflicted upon them, which is still being used today, including: 
</p>
<p>(a) The helicopter: the victim is stripped, hands and feet tied at the back and then 
tied to a tree, hanging or raised above the ground just enough to force the victim to stand on 
their toes for long periods, with their hands tied to the tree; the victim is then made to lie 
face down on the ground in the hot sun, the rain or at night in the cold. The victim may be 
kept in this position for 24 hours, sometimes with two to three short meal or toilet breaks, at 
the whim of the person inflicting the punishment; 
</p>
<p>(b) &#8220;Otto&#8221; (Eight): the victim&#8217;s hands are tied behind their back and they are left 
to lie face down on the ground;  
</p>
<p>(c) Pistols are regularly pointed at detainees during interrogation; 
</p>
<p>(d) Detainees are beaten all over the body and on the soles of the feet with a 
thick metal chain or bar; 
</p>
<p>(e) Sugar is spread on the lips of the detainee, whose hands and feet are tied. The 
detainee is then left outside, where swarms of flies are drawn to the sugar, forcing the 
detainee to make a repetitious neck movement to dispel the flies, leading to severe neck 
strain; alternatively, the whole of the detainee&#8217;s body is smeared with milk and sugar, 
causing flies and other insects to attack. 
</p>
<p>56. Obtaining information from inside Eritrea poses severe challenges; it was therefore 
impossible for the Special Rapporteur to know how many secret detention centres, holding 
cells such as shipping containers or underground bunkers controlled by the military or 
internal security service exist. These are scattered throughout the country, at times in areas 
where temperatures soar to almost 48 degrees Celsius. Not all are officially designated 
prisons, and outsiders are not permitted access. Deaths in prison from torture, </p>


<p>overcrowding, disease, inadequate food and other harsh conditions are frequent, though no 
exact figures were available. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Guilt by association 
</b></p>
<p>57. Family members are frequently punished for the conduct of another family member, 
especially in the case of draft evasion and desertion. In accordance with the policy of &#8220;guilt 
by association&#8221;, families may be fined Nakfa 50,000 ($3,333) for the evasion or desertion 
of a relative. Those who do not or cannot pay may have their property confiscated or be 
jailed, which adds to the already large number of arrests and cases of detention in Eritrea. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Freedom of expression and opinion 
</b></p>
<p>58. Private and independent press or media houses are non-existent in Eritrea. The 
Government destroyed the private press in September 2001 and arrested 10 journalists, who 
remain in incommunicado detention. In 2011, the detention of four more journalists was 
reported; they are still in custody. Journalists do not question policies and their 
implementation for fear of reprisal, arrest, torture or detention without due process.  
</p>
<p>59. Since 2001, propaganda channels run by the Ministry of Information have been the 
only domestic source of news. The content and flow of information are closely controlled 
by government sources. According to a former Eritrean media employee, independent 
sources of information are forbidden and alternative voices silenced or threatened. The 
widely reported coup attempt that was staged on 21 January 2013 illustrates how access to 
information is tightly controlled. Accurate information on the event is still not available and 
the fate of those involved is unknown, apart from unconfirmed reports of extrajudicial 
killings and disappearances.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>60. Internet access is limited, with a penetration below four per cent, primarily through 
cyber caf&#233;s in Asmara and other main towns. Users are closely monitored, and some were 
reportedly arrested in early 2011. Telephone services and the Internet are unavailable in 
rural areas. To obtain a mobile telephone number, an application must be forwarded to a 
government-appointed committee, which vets the applicant before a decision is reached. 
Young people are denied their own mobile telephone numbers. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Freedom of association and assembly 
</b></p>
<p>61. While international law guarantees freedom of assembly and of association, 5 these 
are severely controlled in Eritrea. No political or civic organizations or independent non-
governmental organizations are permitted, except those affiliated to the authorities. The 
Government of Eritrea does not allow the formation of any political parties or private 
associations. This has made it extremely difficult for external human rights defenders to 
monitor the human rights situation in Eritrea.  
</p>
<p>62. In the case of public gatherings, the Government requires those assembling to obtain 
a permit. Public gatherings of more than seven people without a permit are prohibited. 
According to interviewees, critical questions or challenges to policies at Government-
convened meetings may constitute grounds for arrest. 
</p>
<p>  
 5 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, arts. 21 and 22. </p>


<p>63. There is currently no single international non-governmental organization operating 
in Eritrea. Over time, the working environment for such organizations became increasingly 
restrictive, with no travel permits delivered allow them to leave the capital city to visit 
projects. While some non-governmental organizations were explicitly asked to leave, others 
faced severe restrictions on their operations, which eventually forced them to leave the 
country. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Freedom of religious belief 
</b></p>
<p>64. The right to profess one&#8217;s religion freely, to change it or to practice either alone or in 
community with others in public or in private is enshrined in international law.6 Eritrea 
officially recognizes only four religions: the Evangelical Church of Eritrea, the Orthodox 
Church of Eritrea, the Roman Catholic Church, and Sunni Islam. Those interviewed 
reported that the Government interferes in the internal matters of recognized religions 
through controls and invasive policies, including the lack of provisions for exemption from 
military service for conscientious objection. 
</p>
<p>65. The followers of unrecognized religious denominations, such as the Jehovah&#8217;s 
Witnesses, and Evangelical and Pentecostal Churches, among others, face draconian 
restrictions and are persecuted, and may be denied administrative services, such as the 
issuance of national identity cards, as this would require denouncing their religion on the 
application form. It was reported that followers of these religions are regularly arrested, 
detained and tortured, and submitted to sever pressure to renounce their faith. Worshipping 
in someone&#8217;s home or possession of religious material, including Bibles, can be a reason 
for arrest. As at August 2012, there were 56 Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses in prison, including 21 
who were older than 60 years of age. 
</p>
<p>66. Followers of unrecognized religions are often accused of being foreign agents who 
obtain money from external sources to spy on the regime. Reportedly, there are some 2,000 
people currently in jail because of their religious belief, without any charge or trial. A 
woman from a minority religious group indicated that she had been released from jail only 
after having signed a document to the effect that she would no longer worship as part of a 
congregation. An elderly lady was released after four years in detention because of her 
faith; her health had deteriorated visibly. Eritrea does not provide for exemption from 
military service for conscientious objection, which leads to a large number of Jehovah&#8217;s 
Witnesses being placed in detention, given that their religion does not permit them to carry 
a gun. Furthermore, Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses are unable to continue education beyond the 
eighth grade, as students who wish to register for ninth grade are required to register for 
national service at the same time, which is incompatible with their belief. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Freedom of movement 
</b></p>
<p>67. Travel within the country is extremely restricted and requires a travel permit, which 
is difficult to obtain. Controls are frequent at checkpoints between cities. The freedom to 
leave the country is even more tightly controlled. Exit visas are required to travel abroad, 
and they are not granted to men between 18 to 54 years of age and women between 18 and 
</p><p>47. Reports have been received about children as young as 5 years of age being denied 
applications for exit visas. The payment of the &#8220;diaspora tax&#8221;, a 2 per cent tax often levied

<p>by unofficial agents of the Government involving threats, harassment and intimidation, is a 
prerequisite for Eritreans abroad who wish to return home.7 
</p>
<p><b> I. Gender equality issues and w</b>omen&#8217;s rights <b> 
</b></p>
<p>68. The situation of women in Eritrea is a cause for concern. The role of women during 
liberation was well recognized. Eritrean society nonetheless remains patriarchal to a large 
extent, where women may have the same legal rights, but are not treated equally in practice. 
</p>
<p>69. Indefinite conscription affects women as much as men. It may reverse any progress 
made in women&#8217;s reproductive rights. Young women are getting married and giving birth at 
a young age, often to avoid compulsory military service. However, without having 
completed military training, it is extremely difficult to take up gainful employment. 
Consequently, women are often unable to increase the family income, which is solely 
funded through their husbands&#8217; insufficient pay received as soldiers. The main source of 
income for these families appears to be remittances from relatives living abroad or through 
petty trade; a life that the interlocutors said was not sustainable in the long term. 
</p>
<p>70. Allegations of rape and sexual harassment, particularly in military and educational 
training camps or during interrogation, are frequent. The promulgation of proclamation No. 
158/2007 to ban female genital mutilation/cutting and subsequent advocacy against the 
practice has resulted in the decrease in the practice, especially in girls under 15 (from 95 
per cent in 1995 to 83 per cent in 2010), but remains high. The prevalence among girls 
under the age of 15 and 5 stands at 33 per cent and 12.9 per cent, respectively.8 The 
sentence for persons found guilty of performing female genital mutilation is imprisonment 
for two to three years and a fine of 5,000 to 10,000 Nakfa. T the number of prosecutions for 
female genital mutilation since the proclamation was made in 2007 remains, however, 
unknown.  
</p>
<p>71. Although domestic violence is prohibited under international law and criminalized 
under the Eritrean Penal Code, it is still prevalent. Cases of domestic violence are, however, 
rarely brought to trial, and hence no legal penalties are imposed. Furthermore, women 
seldom openly discuss domestic violence because of social pressure. According to some 
interlocutors, such incidents are more commonly addressed within families or by the clergy 
and other religious figures. 
</p>
<p><b> J. Rights of the child 
</b></p>
<p>72. A worrying trend noted by the Special Rapporteur during the recent field mission 
was the high number of unaccompanied children crossing the border, often without the 
knowledge of their families. The children referred to their dysfunctional family 
circumstances and the difficulties faced in child-headed households owing to the long 
absence of their parents, who, as soldiers, were mostly in the military camps, detained or in 
exile. The children also cited lack of educational opportunities and fear of forced 
conscription into indefinite national service as the main reasons for their decision to flee. 
Such a situation poses major protection challenges in host countries and is indicative of the 
scale of despair these children face at home, with a bleak future ahead. 
</p>
<p>73. A teacher who used to work at an elementary school noted a circular issued by the 
Ministry of Defence and dated 15 October 2007, which called on the school administration 
</p>
<p>  
 7 S/2012/545, para. 99.  
 8 See Strategic Partnership Cooperation Framework (2013-2016), p. 22. </p>


<p>to round up a number of students who were physically fit for military training. He was 
afraid that this might mean that underage students were also being targeted for military 
service. The concluding observations made by the Committee on the Rights of the Child on 
the situation in Eritrea are indicative in this context. The Committee expressed its concern 
at reports of &#8220;forced underage recruitment and at the detention and ill-treatment of boys 
under the age when they were required to serve their compulsory military service&#8221;, and 
urged Eritrea to take all possible measures to prevent the recruitment of children.9 
</p>
<p><b> K. Minority rights 
</b></p>
<p>74. Minority groups in Eritrea include the Afar, the Bilen, the Beni Amer, the Kunama, 
the Nara, the Saho and the Tigre. During her mission, the Special Rapporteur met with 
members of the Afar and the Kunama ethnic groups and was able to hold group discussions 
with them. While the human rights violations they described were not necessarily uniquely 
experienced by the groups, they have had a disparate impact on them. 
</p>
<p>75. The Afar are nomadic people living in the area spanning Ethiopia, Djibouti and 
Eritrea along the Red Sea coast. The population of Eritrean Afar has been estimated at 
between 600,000 and 800,000. A sizable proportion left after independence, and 
approximately 19,435 have registered as refugees in Ethiopia.  
</p>
<p>76. The Afar speak a distinct language and are pastoralists. Their wish is to continue 
their traditional way of life, which implies living off their land and its resources, while 
being involved in nomadic animal husbandry, salt mining and fishing.  
</p>
<p>77. The Afar are subjected to extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, torture and 
rape, as well as the destruction of their traditional means of subsistence and livelihood, and 
businesses. They have also been forced into displacement from their traditional territory. 
Forced military training and national service requiring young Afar women to leave their 
homes for long periods of time is met with criticism.  
</p>
<p>78. The Afar consider that they are targeted as a community and are discriminated 
against, given that the Afar region has suffered from lack of development and security for 
the past 20 years. 
</p>
<p>79. The Kunama populate the border areas between Eritrea and Ethiopia, and consider 
themselves the first inhabitants of those areas. Originally a nomadic people, they settled in 
the Gash Barka (formerly Gash Setit) region of Eritrea, one of the most fertile areas of the 
country. Their livelihood is based on farming and herding cattle. Kunama culture is rooted 
in the community and they carry out several tasks communally, such as building their huts, 
farming and harvesting. Some still practice their traditional religion, while others have 
embraced Islam and Christianity.  
</p>
<p>80. Since independence, many people from other regions of Eritrea, particularly from 
the highlands, have been encouraged to settle in areas traditionally populated by the 
Kunama. The Government&#8217;s policy, turning all land into State property, undermined the 
clan-based traditional land tenure system of the Kunama people. It led to competition 
between the Kunama agro-pastoralists and the new settlers for land and grazing grounds, 
resulting in encroachment until much of the land was taken over, forcing the population off 
it.  
</p>
<p>81. The Kunama assert that they have been marginalized, a situation that has brought 
about disparities in their access to such basic social services as health care and education. 
</p>
<p>  
 9 CRC/C/ERI/CO/3, paras. 70-71. </p>


<p>They are subjected to extrajudicial killings, death in custody, arbitrary arrests and detention, 
expropriation leading to destruction of their traditional way of life, and displacement. 
</p>
<p>82. During the border dispute between Eritrea and Ethiopia, the Government of Eritrea 
accused the Kunama of being sympathetic to the Ethiopians, and persecuted them. As a 
result, some 4,000 crossed into Ethiopia in 2000, while others sought refuge in other parts 
of Eritrea. The numbers have since increased; today, the Kunama are scattered throughout 
Eritrea and in refugee camps in Ethiopia. They hope that a significant change in the 
political and human rights environment in the country would allow them to return to their 
homelands. 
</p>
<p><b> L. Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>83. As mentioned above, Eritrea is experiencing difficulties in meeting the Millennium 
Development Goal 1 target of eradicating extreme hunger and poverty. The reality of the 
difficult socioeconomic conditions was regularly noted during the field mission. 
Interlocutors referred to regular power cuts and severe shortages of fuel and of other basic 
commodities, including water.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>84. Eritrea is one of the few countries in Africa that is making steady progress towards 
achieving the health-related Millennium Development Goals 4, 5 and 6 (namely, reductions 
in child mortality, reductions in maternal mortality, and combating HIV and AIDS).10  
</p>
<p>85. The United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, the World Health Organization, the United 
Nations Population Fund and UNDP worked with the State of Eritrea to improve women&#8217;s 
health in an initiative targeting the reduction of maternal mortality rate.11 Maternal 
mortality was reduced from 998/100,000 live births in 1995 to 486/100,000 live births in 
2010.12 
</p>
<p>86. Medical facilities have nonetheless deteriorated over the years, with hospitals 
generally understaffed and underequipped. Despite the decision by the Government to 
launch a programme to decentralize health care and health-care facilities, the challenges of 
providing adequate staff and equipment continue, especially in rural areas. 
</p>
<p>87.<b> </b>Eritrea experiences food production shortages owing to recurrent drought and the 
country&#8217;s exclusive dependence on unpredictable rainfall. Nearly two thirds of the 
population rely on rain-fed agriculture or are pastoralists. While the Government maintains 
there is no food shortage, market food prices have reportedly soared, making even basic 
commodities unaffordable and food rationing widespread. At the same time, farmers may 
sell their produce only to the Government, and at a very low price.  
</p>
<p>88. Several interviewees referred to a coupon system that was the only means of access 
to basic food items and which, they claimed, also served as yet another measure to control 
the population. In many villages, those fit for farming were serving in the military, which 
further contributed to food insecurity. In addition, as a result of the self-reliance policy, 
humanitarian aid organizations are not allowed to operate in Eritrea. 
</p>
<p>  
 10 Eritrea is now quoted as one of only four countries (together with Cape Verde, Mauritius and 
</p>
<p>Seychelles) of 46 in sub-Saharan Africa currently on track to attain Millennium Development Goal 4 
(to reduce child mortality) by 2015; see Strategic Partnership Cooperation Framework (see footnote 
8), pp.7-8.  
</p>

fromwww.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/ourwork/womenempowerment/successstories/eritrea_redu

</p>
<p> 12 Strategic Partnership Cooperation Framework (see footnote 8), p. 11. </p>


<p>89.<b> </b>While basic education in the country is compulsory, free and universal, the 
Government has a tight control over the curriculum. School children, parents and teachers 
alike pointed out that a yearly amount for school material and uniforms had to be paid. For 
cash-strapped families, it was very difficult to gather the necessary amount at the beginning 
of the school year. The only university in the country, the University of Asmara, was closed 
in 2006. Regional colleges, which are administered by the military and linked closely to 
military training and political indoctrination, are the only option for post-secondary 
education. Children who do not pass the eighth grade are conscripted and sent for military 
training in Wi&#8217;a, including those who are underage. Those who pass tenth grade are 
transferred to Sawa for military training. 
</p>
<p>90<b>. </b>In addition to the unpaid work performed by national service conscripts, additional 
restrictions of the right to work were described in various interviews. Opportunities for 
private business activities are extremely limited and those who wish to undertake a self-
sustaining activity are rarely granted the necessary license. Many interlocutors recounted 
how the Government assigned them to specific jobs, often in the context of the national 
service, neither respecting their individual choices nor taking into account their vocational 
training or degree. Furthermore, those working in public service may be dismissed or 
otherwise prevented from continued employment for any criticism perceived or actually 
made. 
</p>
<p><b> M. Refugees and trafficking 
</b></p>
<p>91. While Eritrea is a refugee-producing country, it also hosts asylum seekers and 
refugees. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR), in 2012, Eritrea hosted 2,645 refugees, mainly from Ethiopia, Somalia and the 
Sudan. The Government of Eritrea works to provide for the basic needs of refugees, such as 
education and health care. 
</p>
<p>92. Despite the deadly risks run while attempting to escape the country, large numbers 
of Eritrean citizens have fled over the past decade. In 2012, the total Eritrean population of 
concern to UNHCR amounted to 305,808 persons, including 247,868 refugees, 37,347 
people in a refugee-like situation and 20,523 asylum seekers. According to UNHCR 
estimates, more than 4,000 Eritreans, including unaccompanied minors, flee the country 
every month, despite shoot-to-kill orders implemented by border guards and the extreme 
dangers along escape routes.  
</p>
<p>93. Not only ordinary citizens but also high-profile ones, including former ministers, 
pilots and the national football team, are fleeing and seeking asylum. The path taken by 
refugees may be fraught with obstacles and can be life-threatening, as many have fallen into 
the hands of traffickers and smugglers who demand high ransoms for their victims&#8217; 
freedom. The extensive militarization of all aspects of life in Eritrea, the fear and 
experience of national service, its policy of prolonged military conscription, arbitrary 
arrests, detention and torture and persecution on grounds of religious belief are among the 
main reasons causing people to flee.  
</p>
<p>94. Eritreans in flight have been victims of trafficking and human rights violations in 
countries of transit and where they have sought asylum. The forcible and supposedly 
voluntary return of Eritrean citizens to their country of origin or to third countries, despite 
warnings from UNHCR and other international organizations, is also a cause for grave 
concern. Returnees and failed asylum seekers face disappearance and detention. </p>


<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>While acknowledging the importance of finding a resolution to border disputes, 
Eritrea cannot use this as an excuse to continue to violate its human rights obligations. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Giving effect to the State obligation to respect, protect and fulfil human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>domestically is not dependant on external factors</b>.  
</p>
<p>96.<b> Excessive militarization is affecting the very fabric of Eritrean society, and its 
core unit, the family. The open-ended nature of national service is depriving the 
</b></p>
<p><b>women and men of Eritrea of their most productive years, forcing them to cross 
</b></p>
<p><b>borders to take their destiny into their own hands.  
</b></p>
<p>97.<b> Even children as young as 7 or 8 years of age are crossing borders 
unaccompanied, citing dysfunctional family circumstances caused by the absence of 
</b></p>
<p><b>one parent or even both as a result of conscription, detention or exile or forced 
</b></p>
<p><b>military training as the reasons for flight.  
</b></p>
<p>98.<b> There is no rule of law to provide citizens with a transparent legal system to 
protect them from the arbitrary use of power by the State, other institutions and 
</b></p>
<p><b>individuals. 
</b></p>
<p>99<b>. There are no internal mechanisms or institutions to hold to account those 
responsible for the pervasive human rights violations committed on a daily basis in 
</b></p>
<p><b>Eritrea. The State is obliged to investigate and prosecute those responsible for human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights violations. This legal obligation to punish those found guilty of having 
</b></p>
<p><b>committed human rights violations is an important element of the rule of law. The 
</b></p>
<p>State&#8217;s<b> failure to investigate, to punish perpetrators and to provide reparations for 
</b></p>
<p><b>victims perpetuates a culture of impunity that undermines the credibility of the 
</b></p>
<p>country&#8217;s criminal justice system.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>100.<b> Extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, indefinite incommunicado 
detention, torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, all of which are prevalent 
</b></p>
<p><b>in Eritrea, undermine the deepest values of any society committed to respect for 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights and fundamental freedoms.  
</b></p>
<p>101.<b> Freedom of expression and opinion, of assembly and association, the very 
cornerstones of an open society respecting the democratic principles of governance, 
</b></p>
<p><b>are severely curtailed, creating a climate of fear fuelled by rumours, propaganda and 
</b></p>
<p><b>suspicion. The result is an all-encompassing feeling of fear and distrust, even within 
</b></p>
<p><b>families, reflecting a pervasive intelligence network that the Government of Eritrea 
</b></p>
<p><b>has established throughout the country. 
</b></p>
<p>102.<b> People cannot choose their profession and their remunerations are too low, 
causing them to rely on remittances from family and friends from abroad and pooling 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources to be able to live in dignity. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>While human rights violations are widespread and pervasive and affect all 
components of Eritrean society, minority ethnic groups suffer from a disparate 
</b></p>
<p><b>impact, multiple forms of discrimination and marginalization, leading to exile. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>Real change would require a fundamental reform process transforming the 
current culture of rights denial into one anchored in the rule of law and in respect for 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the realization of all human rights and human dignity. </b></p>


<p>105. <b>During the initial period of the mandate, the Special Rapporteur concentrated 
on ensuring access to Eritrea and opening up channels of communications with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government, gathering information on the human rights violations, and engaging 
</b></p>
<p><b>with a broad spectrum of interlocutors to gather information about the human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>situation in Eritrea, primarily with victims. 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>The Special Rapporteur would like to focus on three priority areas and relative 
action points in the delivery of the mandate in the medium term:  
</b></p>
