CAUTIONARY STATEMENT
REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This report includes statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities
laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements may relate to, but are not limited to,
information or assumptions about us, our capital and other expenditures, our bankruptcy proceedings, dividends,
financing plans, capital structure, cash flow, pending legal and regulatory proceedings and claims, including
environmental matters, future economic performance, operating income, cost savings, and management’s plans,
strategies, goals and objectives for future operations and growth. These forward-looking statements generally are
accompanied by words such as “intend,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “should,” “seek,” “project,” “plan” or
similar expressions. Any statement that is not a historical fact is a forward-looking statement. It should be understood
that these forward-looking statements are necessarily estimates reflecting the best judgment of senior management,
not guarantees of future performance. They are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Forward-
looking statements in this report may include, for example, statements about:
·fluctuations in demand or the prices received for oil and natural gas;
 ·the amount, nature and timing of capital expenditures;
 ·drilling, completion and performance of wells;
 ·competition and government regulations;
 ·timing and amount of future production of oil and natural gas;
 ·costs of exploiting and developing properties and conducting other operations, in the aggregate and on a per-unit
equivalent basis;
 ·changes in proved reserves;
 ·operating costs and other expenses;
 ·our future financial condition, results of operations, revenue, cash flows and anticipated expenses;
 ·estimates of proved reserves;
 ·exploitation of property acquisitions; and
 ·marketing of oil and natural gas.
These forward-looking statements represent intentions, plans, expectations, assumptions and beliefs about future
events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors. Many of those factors are outside of our control and
could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by those forward-looking
statements. These risks and uncertainties include those factors described in Item 1A of this report and under the
heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Specifically, some
factors that could cause actual results to differ include:
·risks and uncertainties associated with our Chapter 11 Cases (as defined herein), including our ability to develop,
confirm and consummate a plan under Chapter 11;
 ·the significant amount of our debt;
 ·worldwide supply of and demand for oil and natural gas;
·volatility and declines in oil and natural gas prices;
 ·drilling plans (including scheduled and budgeted wells);
·drilling plans (including scheduled and budgeted wells);
 ·the number, timing or results of any wells;
 ·changes in wells operated and in reserve estimates;
·supply of CO2 ;
 ·future growth and expansion;
 ·future exploration;
 ·integration of existing and new technologies into operations;
3
·future capital expenditures (or funding thereof) and working capital; 
 ·borrowings and capital resources and liquidity;
 ·changes in strategy and business discipline;
 ·future tax matters;
 ·any loss of key personnel;
 ·future seismic data (including timing and results);
 ·the plans for timing, interpretation and results of new or existing seismic surveys or seismic data;
 ·geopolitical events affecting oil and natural gas prices;
 ·outcome, effects or timing of legal proceedings;
 ·the effect of litigation and contingencies;
 ·the ability to generate additional prospects; and
 ·the ability to successfully complete merger, acquisition or divestiture plans, regulatory or other limitations imposed as
a result of a merger, acquisition or divestiture, and the success of the business following a merger, acquisition or
divestiture.
Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual
results may vary in material respects from those projected in the forward-looking statements contained herein. We
undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. All forward-looking statements
included herein are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this
section.

(Debtor in possession)
Condensed notes to consolidated financial statements (unaudited)
(dollars in thousands, unless otherwise noted)
Note 1: Nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies
Nature of operations
Chaparral Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries, (collectively, “we”, “our”, “us”, or the “Company”) are involved in the
acquisition, exploration, development, production and operation of oil and natural gas properties. Our properties are
located primarily in Oklahoma and Texas. As discussed in “Note 2—Chapter 11 filing,” we are currently operating our
business as debtor in possession in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.
Interim financial statements
The accompanying unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in
accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and do not include all of the financial information and
disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for
complete financial statements. These financial statements and the notes thereto should be read in conjunction with our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
The financial information as of June 30, 2016, and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, and 2015,
respectively, is unaudited. The financial information as of December 31, 2015, has been derived from the audited
financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. In
management’s opinion, such information contains all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the
results of the interim periods. The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, are not
necessarily indicative of the results of operations that will be realized for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Cash and cash equivalents
We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. We
maintain cash and cash equivalents in bank deposit accounts and money market funds which may not be federally
insured. As of June 30, 2016, cash with a recorded balance totaling $20,746 and $51,172 was held at JP Morgan
Chase Bank, N.A and Arvest Bank, respectively. In addition, we also held cash equivalents in the form of treasury
securities with a recorded balance of $101,060 at Arvest Wealth Management. We have not experienced any losses in
such accounts and believe we are not exposed to any significant credit risk on such accounts. We are not party to any
valid blocked account agreements with respect to any material amount of cash.
Accounts receivable
We have receivables from joint interest owners and oil and natural gas purchasers which are generally
uncollateralized. We generally review our oil and natural gas purchasers for credit worthiness and general financial
condition. We may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover non-payment of joint interest
billings on properties of which we are the operator. Accounts receivable from joint interest owners are stated at
amounts due, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable are generally due within 30 days and
accounts outstanding longer than 60 days are considered past due. We establish our allowance for doubtful accounts
by considering the length of time past due, previous loss history, future net revenues of the debtor’s ownership interest
in oil and natural gas properties we operate, and our assessment of the owner’s ability to pay its obligation, among
other things.
We write off accounts receivable when they are determined to be uncollectible. When we recover amounts that were
previously written off, those amounts are offset against the allowance and reduce expense in the year of recovery.

Accounts receivable—derivative settlements
The balance reflects amounts due to us by our counterparties for derivative contracts that have matured. Cash
settlements of matured contracts can occur up to 60 days past maturity as specified under the contracts. As discussed
in “Note 5—Derivative instruments,” the balance as of June 30, 2016, reflects amounts due to us from prior maturities
and from the early termination of all outstanding derivatives.
Inventories
Inventories are comprised of equipment used in developing oil and natural gas properties and oil and natural gas
product inventories. We evaluate our inventory each quarter and when there is evidence that the utility of our inventory,
in their disposal in the ordinary course of business, will be less than cost, whether due to physical deterioration,
obsolescence, changes in price levels, or other causes, we record an impairment loss for the difference. Inventories
are shown net of a provision for obsolescence, commensurate with known or estimated exposure, which is reflected in
the valuation allowance disclosed below. We recorded a lower of cost or market adjustment of $7,296 on our
equipment inventory for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, to reflect lower market prices resulting from a
decline in demand for such equipment as drilling activity had decreased due to the low price environment. The
sustained deterioration in industry conditions resulted in additional lower of cost or market adjustments of $1,259
during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016. These adjustments are reflected in “Loss on impairment of other
assets” in our consolidated statements of operations. Inventories at June 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, consisted

Oil and natural gas properties
Capitalized Costs. We use the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties and activities.
Accordingly, we capitalize all costs incurred in connection with the exploration for and development of oil and natural
gas reserves. Proceeds from the disposition of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as a reduction in
capitalized costs, with no gain or loss generally recognized unless such dispositions involve a significant alteration in
the depletion rate. We capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with exploration and development
activities, but do not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities.
Capitalized costs include geological and geophysical work, 3D seismic, delay rentals, drilling and completing and
equipping oil and natural gas wells, including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these
activities.
The costs of unevaluated oil and natural gas properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are
evaluated. Costs are transferred into the amortization base on an ongoing basis as the properties are evaluated and
proved reserves are established or impairment is determined. Work-in-progress costs are included in unevaluated oil
and natural gas properties and as of June 30, 2016, include $8,560 of capital costs incurred for undeveloped acreage
and $4,402 for wells and facilities in progress pending determination. As of December 31, 2015, work-in-progress
costs included capital costs incurred of $60,031 for undeveloped acreage and $6,874 for wells and facilities in
progress pending determination.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”) of oil and natural gas
properties are provided using the units-of-production method based on estimates of proved oil and natural gas
reserves and production, which are converted to a common unit of measure based upon their relative energy content.
Our cost basis for depletion includes estimated future development costs to be incurred on proved undeveloped
properties. The computation of DD&A takes into consideration restoration, dismantlement, and abandonment costs,
and the anticipated proceeds from salvaging equipment.
Ceiling Test. In accordance with the full cost method of accounting, the net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas
properties are not to exceed their related PV-10 value, net of tax considerations, plus the cost of unproved properties
not being amortized.
Our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves as of June 30, 2016, were prepared using an average price for oil and
natural gas on the first day of each month for the prior twelve months as required by the SEC.
Due to the substantial decline of commodity prices that began in mid-2014 and which continue to remain low, the cost
center ceiling exceeded the net capitalized cost of our oil and natural gas properties at the end of each quarter during
the current year, resulting in ceiling test write-downs. The amount of any future impairment is generally difficult to
predict, and will depend on the average oil and natural gas prices during each period, the incremental proved reserves
added during each period, and additional capital spent.
Impairment of long-lived assets
Impairment losses are recorded on property and equipment used in operations and other long-lived assets held and
used when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those
assets are less than the assets’ carrying amount. Impairment is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount
over the fair value of the asset. Impairment losses are also recorded on assets classified as held for sale when there is
an excess of carrying value over fair value less costs to sell.
We recorded impairment losses of $6,015 related to four drilling rigs not currently in use for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2015. One of the rigs was last deployed in January 2015 while the remaining three have been stacked
for three to four years. The loss was recorded as a result of the deterioration in commodity prices and drilling activity
whereby the value of such equipment had declined while utilizing third party equipment had become more cost
effective, resulting in us impairing the value of the rigs to their estimated fair value. These losses are reflected in “Loss
on impairment of other assets” in our consolidated statements of operations.
Our bankruptcy filing on May 9, 2016, (see “Note 2—Chapter 11 filing”) was an event that required an assessment
whether the carrying amounts of our long-lived assets would be recoverable. Our evaluation indicated that no
additional impairment was necessary as a direct result of the bankruptcy,
Stock-based compensation
Our stock-based compensation programs consist of phantom stock, restricted stock units (“RSU”), and restricted stock
awards issued to employees. Generally, we use new shares to grant restricted stock awards, and we cancel restricted
shares forfeited or repurchased for tax withholding. Canceled shares are available to be issued as new grants under
our 2010 Equity Incentive Plan. We consider the measurement of fair value of our phantom stock, RSU and restricted
stock awards, discussed below, to be a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
The estimated fair value of the phantom stock and RSU awards are remeasured at the end of each reporting period
until settlement. The estimated fair market value of these awards is calculated based on our total asset value less total
liabilities, with assets being adjusted to fair value in accordance with the terms of the Phantom Stock Plan and the
Non-Officer Restricted Stock Unit Plan. The primary adjustment required is the adjustment of oil and natural gas
properties from net book value to the discounted and risk-adjusted reserve value based on internal reserve reports
priced on NYMEX forward strips. Compensation cost associated with the phantom stock awards and RSU awards is
recognized over the vesting period using the straight-line method and the accelerated method, respectively. The fair
value of our restricted stock awards that include a service condition is based upon the estimated fair market value of
our common equity per share on a minority, non-marketable basis on the date of grant, and is remeasured at the end of
each reporting period until settlement. We recognize compensation cost over the requisite service period using the
accelerated method for awards with graded vesting.

(dollars in thousands, unless otherwise noted)
We use a Monte Carlo model to estimate the grant date fair value of restricted stock awards that include a market
condition. This model includes various significant assumptions, including the expected volatility of the share awards
and the probabilities of certain vesting conditions. Compensation cost associated with restricted stock awards that
include a market condition is recognized over the requisite service period using the straight-line method. The
assumptions used to value our stock-based compensation awards reflect our best estimates, but they involve inherent
uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of our control. As a result, stock-based compensation
expense could have been significantly impacted if other assumptions had been used.
The costs associated with our stock-based compensation programs is calculated net of forfeitures, which are estimated
based on our historical and expected turnover rates. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate,
the stock-based compensation cost could be different from what we have recorded in the current period.
Income Taxes
Although we recorded a net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2016, we did not record any corresponding tax
benefit as any deferred tax asset arising from the loss is currently not believed to be realizable and is therefore
reduced by a valuation allowance. At June 30, 2016, our valuation allowance is $569,726 which reduces our net
deferred tax assets to zero value as we continue to believe that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the
deferred tax assets primarily related to our cumulative net operating losses. Income tax recognized for the six months
ended June 30, 2016, is a result of current Texas margin tax on gross revenues less certain deductions. See “Note 10
—Income Taxes” in Item 8. Financial Statement and Supplementary Data of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015, for additional information about our income taxes.
As described in “Note 2—Chapter 11 filing”, in conjunction with our efforts to restructure our indebtedness, on May 9,
2016, we filed voluntary petitions seeking relief under Title 11 of the United States Code in the United States
Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware commencing cases for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.
Our negotiations to restructure our debt include a proposal for the holders of our Senior Notes to convert those notes
into equity of the reorganized Company, effectuated through a plan of reorganization in bankruptcy. Absent an
exception, a debtor recognizes cancellation of indebtedness income (“CODI”) upon discharge of its outstanding
indebtedness for an amount of consideration that is less than its adjusted issue price. The Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (“IRC”), provides that a debtor in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy case may exclude CODI from taxable
income but must reduce certain of its tax attributes by the amount of any CODI realized as a result of the
consummation of a plan of reorganization. The amount of CODI realized by a taxpayer is determined based on the fair
market value of the consideration received by the creditors in settlement of outstanding indebtedness. Upon
emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, the CODI may reduce some or all of the amount of prior tax
attributes, which can include net operating losses, capital losses, alternative minimum tax credits and tax basis in
assets. The actual reduction in tax attributes does not occur until the first day of the Company’s tax year ending
subsequent to the date of emergence.
The IRC provides an annual limitation with respect to the ability of a corporation to utilize its tax attributes, as well as
certain built-in-losses, against future taxable income in the event of a change in ownership. Emergence from Chapter
11 bankruptcy proceedings may result in a change in ownership for purposes of the IRC. However, the IRC provides
alternatives for taxpayers in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings that may or may not result in an annual limitation. We
are in the process of determining which alternatives are most beneficial to us in conjunction with our ongoing
negotiations with our debtholders.
Liability Management
Liability management expense includes third party legal and professional service fees incurred from our activities to
restructure our debt and in preparation for our bankruptcy petition. As a result of our Chapter 11 petition, such
expenses, to the extent that they are incremental and directly related to our bankruptcy reorganization, are reflected in
“Reorganization items” in our consolidated statements of operations.

Cost reduction initiatives
Cost reduction initiatives include expenses related to our efforts to reduce our capital, operating and administrative
costs in response to the depressed commodity pricing environment. The expense consists of costs for one-time
severance and termination benefits in connection with our reductions in force and third party legal and professional
services we have engaged to assist in our cost savings initiatives as follows:

Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
In November 2015, the FASB issued authoritative guidance aimed at simplifying the accounting for deferred taxes. To
simplify presentation, the new guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related
valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. As a result, each jurisdiction will now only have
one net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability. Importantly, the guidance does not change the existing requirement
that only permits offsetting within a jurisdiction – that is, companies are still prohibited from offsetting deferred tax
liabilities from one jurisdiction against deferred tax assets of another jurisdiction. This guidance was early adopted on
a prospective basis during the second quarter of 2016 and allowed us to offset our noncurrent deferred income tax
asset with our current deferred income tax liability. Other than the preceding balance sheet change, the adoption did
not have a material impact on our financial statements and results of operations.
Recently issued accounting pronouncements
In May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that supersedes previous revenue recognition requirements and
requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in
an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or
services. The FASB recently approved a delay which will make the updated guidance effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted
only for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2016, and interim periods thereafter. We are currently evaluating the
effect the new standard will have on our financial statements and results of operations.
In January 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that amends existing requirements on the classification and
measurement of financial instruments. The standard principally affects accounting for equity investments and financial
liabilities where the fair value option has been elected. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2017, and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption of certain provisions is permitted. We are currently
evaluating the effect the new guidance will have on our financial statements and results of operations.
In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance significantly amending the current accounting for leases.
Under the new provisions, all lessees will report a right-of-use asset and a liability for the obligation to make payments
for all leases with the exception of those leases with a term of 12 months or less. All other leases will fall into one of
two categories: (i) a financing lease or (ii) an operating lease. Lessor accounting remains substantially unchanged with
the exception that no leases entered into after the effective date will be classified as leveraged leases. For sale
leaseback transactions, a sale will only be recognized if the criteria in the new revenue recognition standard are met.
For public business entities, this guidance is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim
periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect the new guidance will have on
our financial statements and results of operations.
In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance with the objective to simplify several aspects of the accounting
for share-based payments, including accounting for income taxes when awards vest or are settled, statutory
withholdings and accounting for forfeitures. Classification of these aspects on the statement of cash flows is also
addressed. For public business entities, this guidance is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15,
2016, and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted.

We do not expect this guidance to materially impact our financial statements or results of operations in connection with
our outstanding awards.
In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that clarifies that the assessment of whether an embedded
contingent put or call option in a financial instrument is clearly and closely related to the debt host requires only an
analysis of the four-step decision sequence described in ASC 815. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted in any interim period for which financial statements have not
been issued, but would be retroactively applied to the beginning of the year that includes the interim period. We are
currently evaluating the effect the new guidance will have on our financial statements and results of operations.
In June 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of
certain financial instruments. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, however
early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently evaluating the effect
the new guidance will have on our financial statements and results of operations.
Note 2: Chapter 11 filing
Background. The severe and sustained decline in oil and natural gas prices since mid-2014 has negatively impacted
revenues, earnings and cash flows, and our liquidity. As a result of our deteriorating liquidity, there was and continues
to be uncertainty regarding our ability to repay our outstanding debt obligations as they became due, especially in the
event of any acceleration of indebtedness, and hence substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern. This doubt was expressed in the audit opinion of our annual consolidated financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2015, and constituted an event of default under our Credit Facility since the covenants under the
facility require us to deliver our annual financial statements without a going concern explanatory paragraph.
On March 1 and April 1, 2016, we elected not to make interest payments on our 8.25% Senior Notes and 9.875%
Senior Notes, respectively. Under the indenture governing these Senior Notes, the failure to make the interest
payments was subject to a 30-day grace period before constituting an event of default. We did not make either interest
payment on the Senior Notes within their respective 30-day grace periods and as a result, are currently in default
under the indentures governing these Senior Notes. While in default, the outstanding principal and any accrued
interest may be called upon which would cause it to be immediately due and payable. Our failure to make such interest
payments within the 30-day grace period also resulted in a cross default under our Credit Facility, capital leases and
mortgage note.
The defaults discussed above result in cross defaults on our remaining indebtedness and therefore subjected all our
debt to potential acceleration in the event that the outstanding amounts are called by our lenders.
Faced with these defaults, we entered into agreements (the “Forbearance Agreements”) with the lenders under our
Credit Facility and an ad hoc committee (the “Ad Hoc Committee”) of noteholders collectively holding more than 50%
of the Senior Notes outstanding to forbear from exercising remedies on account of the missed interest payments and
certain other alleged defaults specified in the Forbearance Agreements through and including May 1, 2016. While the
Forbearance Agreements were in effect, we continued to engage in good-faith arm’s-length negotiations regarding a
potential restructuring of the Credit Facility and the Senior Notes that would materially delever the Company’s balance
sheet and allow us to retain sufficient liquidity to continue to operate our business going forward. In the course of these
negotiations, the Company, the lenders under the Credit Facility, and the Ad Hoc Committee exchanged and
considered, with the assistance of their respective advisors, numerous restructuring proposals.
On May 9, 2016 (the “Petition Date”), Chaparral Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries including Chaparral Energy, L.L.C.,
Chaparral Resources, L.L.C., Chaparral Real Estate, L.L.C., Chaparral CO2 , L.L.C., CEI Pipeline, L.L.C., CEI
Acquisition, L.L.C., Green Country Supply, Inc., Chaparral Biofuels, L.L.C., Chaparral Exploration, L.L.C., Roadrunner
Drilling, L.L.C. (collectively, the “Chapter 11 Subsidiaries” and, together with Chaparral Energy, Inc., the “Debtors”)
filed voluntary petitions seeking relief under Title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”) commencing cases for relief under
chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the “Chapter 11 Cases”). Our filing of the Chapter 11 Cases constitutes an
additional event of default under our Credit Facility, Senior Notes, capital leases and mortgage note.

Debtor-In-Possession. We are currently operating our business as debtors in possession in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. We have filed a variety of first day motions with the Bankruptcy Court
that will allow us to continue to operate our business without interruption. These motions are designed primarily to
minimize the impact of our bankruptcy filing on our operations, creditors and employees. The Bankruptcy Court has
granted all first day motions filed by us and our Chapter 11 Subsidiaries. As a result, we not only are able to conduct
normal business activities and pay the associated obligations for the period following our bankruptcy filing, we are also
authorized to pay (subject to caps applicable to payments of certain pre-petition obligations) pre-petition employee
wages and benefits, pre-petition amounts owed to certain lienholders and critical vendors and funds belonging to third
parties, including royalty interest holders and partners. During the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, all transactions
outside the ordinary course of our business require the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court. Final orders on the
motions to satisfy our obligations to certain third parties and to forward funds held by us that belong to third parties
were granted on June 7, 2016.
Automatic Stay. Subject to certain exceptions, under the Bankruptcy Code, the filing of the bankruptcy petitions
automatically enjoined, or stayed, the continuation of most judicial or administrative proceedings or the filing of other
actions against us or our property to recover, collect or secure a claim arising prior to the Petition Date. Creditors are
stayed from taking any actions against us as a result of debt defaults, subject to certain limited exceptions permitted by
the Bankruptcy Code.
Risks Associated with Chapter 11 Proceedings. For the duration of our Chapter 11 Cases, our operations and ability to
develop and execute our business plan are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11
process. As a result of these risks and uncertainties, the number of our outstanding shares of common stock and
stockholders, assets, liabilities, officers and/or directors could be significantly different following the outcome of the
Chapter 11 Cases, and the description of our operations, properties and capital plans included in this quarterly report
may not accurately reflect our operations, properties and capital plans following our emergence from bankruptcy.
Executory Contracts. In particular, subject to certain exceptions, under the Bankruptcy Code, we may assume, assign,
or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and certain
other conditions. Generally, the rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease is treated as a pre-petition breach
of such executory contract or unexpired lease and, subject to certain exceptions, relieves us of performing future
obligations under such executory contract or unexpired lease but entitles the contract counterparty or lessor to a pre-
petition general unsecured claim for damages caused by such deemed breach. Counterparties to such rejected
contracts or leases may assert unsecured claims in the Bankruptcy Court against the applicable Debtors’ estate for
such damages. Generally, the assumption of an executory contract or unexpired lease requires us to cure existing
monetary defaults under such executory contract or unexpired lease and provide adequate assurance of future
performance. Accordingly, any description of an executory contract or unexpired lease involving us in these financial
statements, including where applicable, a quantification of our obligations under any such executory contract or
unexpired lease with us is qualified by our rights to reject such executory contract or unexpired lease under the
Bankruptcy Code.
Magnitude of Potential Claims. On June 29, 2016, we filed with the Bankruptcy Court schedules and statements
setting forth, among other things, our assets and liabilities, subject to the assumptions filed in connection therewith (the
“Schedules and Statements”). We may subsequently decide to amend or modify our Schedules and Statements.
On June 13, 2016, we filed a motion to set a bar date to assist with the claims reconciliation process.  The Bankruptcy
Court approved such motion on July 1, 2016, setting the bar date on August 19, 2016. Through the claims resolution
process, differences in amounts scheduled by the Debtors and claims filed by creditors will be investigated and
resolved, including through the filing of objections with the Bankruptcy Court where appropriate. In light of the potential
number and amount of claims filed, the claims resolution process may take considerable time to complete, and we
expect that it will continue after our emergence from bankruptcy. Accordingly, the ultimate number and amount of
allowed claims is not presently known, nor can the ultimate recovery with respect to allowed claims be presently
ascertained.
Effect of Filing on Creditors and Shareholders. Under the priority scheme established by the Bankruptcy Code, unless
creditors agree otherwise, pre-petition liabilities and post-petition liabilities must be satisfied in full or consensual
agreement reached between parties before the holders of our existing common stock are entitled to receive any
distribution or retain any property under a plan of reorganization. The ultimate recovery to creditors and/or
shareholders, if any, will not be determined until confirmation and implementation of a plan or plans of reorganization.
No assurance can be given as to what values, if any, will be ascribed in the Chapter 11 proceedings to each of these
constituencies or what types or amounts of distributions, if any, they would receive. A plan of reorganization could
result in holders of our liabilities and/or securities, including our common stock, receiving no distribution on
16
Chaparral Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries
(Debtor in possession)
Condensed notes to consolidated financial statements (unaudited) – continued
(dollars in thousands, unless otherwise noted)
account of their interests and cancellation of their holdings. As discussed below, if certain requirements of the
Bankruptcy Code are met, a plan of reorganization can be confirmed notwithstanding its rejection by the holders of our
common stock and notwithstanding the fact that such holders do not receive or retain any property on account of their
equity interests under the plan. Because of such possibilities, the value of our securities is highly speculative.
Process for Plan of Reorganization. In order to successfully exit bankruptcy, we will need to propose, and obtain
confirmation by the Bankruptcy Court of, a plan (or plans) of reorganization that satisfies the requirements of the
Bankruptcy Code. A plan of reorganization would, among other things, resolve our pre-petition obligations, set forth the
revised capital structure of the newly reorganized entity and provide for corporate governance subsequent to exit from
bankruptcy.
We have the exclusive right for 120 days after the Petition Date to file a plan of reorganization subject to extension for
cause. If the Exclusive Filing Period lapses, any party in interest may file a plan of reorganization for any of the
Debtors.
In addition to being voted on by holders of impaired claims and equity interests, a plan of reorganization must satisfy
certain requirements of the Bankruptcy Code and must be confirmed, by the Bankruptcy Court in order to become
effective. A plan of reorganization would be accepted by holders of claims against and equity interests in us if (i) more
than one-half in number and at least two-thirds in dollar amount of allowed claims actually voting in each class of
claims impaired by the plan have voted to accept the plan and (ii) at least two-thirds in amount of allowed equity
interests actually voting in each class of equity interests impaired by the plan has voted to accept the plan. A class of
claims or equity interests that does not receive or retain any property under the plan on account of such claims or
interests is deemed to have voted to reject the plan.
Under certain circumstances set forth in Section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Court may confirm a
plan even if such plan has not been accepted by all impaired classes of claims and equity interests. The precise
requirements and evidentiary showing for confirming a plan notwithstanding its rejection by one or more impaired
classes of claims or equity interests depends upon a number of factors, including the status and seniority of the claims
or equity interests in the rejecting class (i.e., secured claims or unsecured claims, subordinated or senior claims,
preferred or common stock). Generally, with respect to common stock interests, a plan may be “crammed down” even if
the shareholders receive no recovery if the proponent of the plan demonstrates that (1) no class junior to the common
stock is receiving or retaining property under the plan and (2) no class of claims or interests senior to the common
stock is being paid more than in full.
Our timing of filing a plan of reorganization will depend on the timing and outcome of numerous other ongoing matters
in the Chapter 11 Cases. Although we expect to file a plan of reorganization that provides for emergence from
bankruptcy as a going concern, there can be no assurance at this time that we will be able to successfully develop,
confirm and consummate one or more plans of reorganization or other alternative restructuring transactions, that
satisfies the conditions of the Bankruptcy Code and is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, or that any such plan will be
implemented successfully.
Basis of Accounting. As noted above, the uncertainty regarding our ability to meet our debt obligations and the
resultant filing of the Chapter 11 Cases raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which
contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the
normal course of business. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not purport to reflect or provide for
the consequences of our Chapter 11 Cases, other than as set forth under “Liabilities subject to compromise” and
“Reorganization items” on the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In particular, the financial statements
do not purport to show (i) as to assets, their realizable value on a liquidation basis or their availability to satisfy
liabilities; (ii) as to pre-petition liabilities, the amounts that may be allowed for claims or contingencies, or the status
and priority thereof; (iii) as to stockholders’ equity accounts, the effect of any changes that may be made in our
capitalization; or (iv) as to operations, the effect of any changes that may be made to our business. We have accounted
for the bankruptcy in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 852, Reorganizations.
Liabilities Subject to Compromise. Our financial statements include amounts classified as liabilities subject to
compromise which represent estimates of pre-petition obligations that we anticipate will be allowed as claims in our
bankruptcy case. These liabilities are reported at the amounts expected to be allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, even if
they may be settled for lesser amounts. The amounts currently classified as liabilities subject to compromise may be
subject to future adjustments depending on the Bankruptcy Court actions, further development with respect to disputed
claims, and other events. Additional amounts may be included in liabilities subject to compromise in future periods if
executory contracts and unexpired leases are rejected. Conversely, to the extent that such executory contracts or
unexpired leases are not rejected and are instead assumed, certain liabilities characterized as subject to
17
Chaparral Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries
(Debtor in possession)
Condensed notes to consolidated financial statements (unaudited) – continued
(dollars in thousands, unless otherwise noted)
compromise may be converted to post-petition liabilities. Because of the uncertain nature of many of the potential
claims, the magnitude of such claims is not reasonably estimable at this time. We will continue to evaluate these
liabilities during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases and adjust amounts as necessary. The magnitude of claims

Reorganization Items. We use this category to reflect, where applicable, post-petition revenues, expenses, gains and
losses that are direct and incremental as a result of the reorganization of the business. We have incurred and will
continue to incur significant costs associated with the reorganization. The amount of these costs, which are being
expensed as incurred, are expected to significantly affect our results of operations. For the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016, we have booked $5,355 of expense for professional fees incurred as a result of the reorganization.

(1)These unsecured obligations have been classified as “Liabilities subject to compromise” as of June 30, 2016.
(2)These secured obligations have not been classified as “Liabilities subject to compromise” as we believe the values
of the underlying assets provide sufficient collateral to satisfy such obligations.
We are currently in default on all our indebtedness. The defaults stem from, among others, our commencement of the
Chapter 11 Cases, direct defaults as a result of nonpayment of interest, violations of financial covenants and the
inclusion of a going concern explanatory paragraph in the audit opinion of our annual financial statements. Moreover,
due to our commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, all of our indebtedness has been accelerated by operation of law.
Senior Notes
The Senior Notes, which, as of June 30, 2016, include our 9.875% senior notes due 2020, our 8.25% senior notes due
2021 (the “2021 Senior Notes”), and our 7.625% senior notes due 2022 (collectively, our “Senior Notes”) are our senior
unsecured obligations, rank equally in right of payment with all our existing and future senior debt, and rank senior to
all of our existing and future subordinated debt. Pursuant to accounting guidance while in bankruptcy, all our Senior
Notes and the associated accrued interest have been classified as “Liabilities subject to compromise” on our
consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2016. We will not accrue interest expense on our Senior Notes during the
pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases as we do not expect to pay such interest. As a result, reported interest expense is
$14,338 lower than had we accrued contractual interest through June 30, 2016.
In March 2016 we wrote off the remaining unamortized issuance costs, premium and discount related to our Senior
Notes for a net charge of $16,970. These deferred items are typically amortized over the life of the corresponding bond.
However, as a result of not paying the interest due on our 2021 Senior Notes by the end of our 30-day grace period on
March 31, 2016, as discussed in “Note 2—Chapter 11 filing,” we triggered an Event of Default on our Senior Notes.
While uncured, the Event of Default effectively allows the lender to demand immediate repayment, thus shortening the
life of our Senior Notes to the current period. As a result, we wrote off the remaining balance of unamortized issuance
costs, premium and discount on March 31, 2016, as follows:
19
Non-cash expense for write-off of debt issuance costs on Senior Notes $17,756 
Non-cash expense for write-off of debt discount costs on Senior Notes    4,014

Credit Facility
In April 2010, we entered into an Eighth Restated Credit Agreement (our “Credit Facility”), which is collateralized by
our oil and natural gas properties and, as amended, matures on November 1, 2017. During the six months ended
June 30, 2016, we had additional net borrowings of $181,000 on our Credit Facility. As of June 30, 2016, the weighted
average interest rate was 7.0% on outstanding borrowings under Credit Facility. This rate represents the default rate
and is based on the Alternate Base Rate (as defined under the Credit Facility) plus an additional 2.00% and plus the
applicable margin.
As discussed in “Note 5—Derivative instruments,” $103,560 of proceeds payable to us from the termination of our
derivative contracts were utilized to offset and hence reduce our outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility
during the third quarter of 2016.
Availability under our Credit Facility was subject to a borrowing base which is set by the banks semiannually on May 1
and November 1 of each year. In addition, the lenders may request a borrowing base redetermination once between
each scheduled redetermination and in the event of early termination of our derivative contracts. We are currently in
negotiations, as part of our reorganization, regarding the structure of our exit financing upon emergence from
bankruptcy where we believe such financing will include a revolving credit facility subject to a borrowing base.
Subject to certain exceptions, under the Bankruptcy Code, the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases automatically
enjoined, or stayed, the continuation of most judicial or administrative proceedings or the filing of other actions against
us or our property to recover, collect or secure a claim arising prior to the Petition Date. Creditors are stayed from
taking any actions against us as a result of debt defaults, subject to certain limited exceptions permitted by the
Bankruptcy Code. There can be no assurances that the agent and lenders will consensually agree to a restructuring of
the Credit Facility. Any proposed non-consensual restructuring of the Credit Facility could result in substantial delay in
emergence from bankruptcy and there can be no assurances that the Bankruptcy Court would approve such proposed
non-consensual restructuring. During the Chapter 11 Cases, we expect to remain current on our interest payments
under the Credit Facility to the extent required by order of the Bankruptcy Court.
Capital Leases
During 2013, we entered into lease financing agreements with U.S. Bank National Association for $24,500 through the
sale and subsequent leaseback of existing compressors owned by us. The carrying value of these compressors is
included in our oil and natural gas full cost pool. The lease financing obligations are for 84 -month terms and include
the option to purchase the equipment for a specified price at 72 months as well as an option to purchase the
equipment at the end of the lease term for its then-current fair market value. Lease payments related to the equipment
are recognized as principal and interest expense based on a weighted average implicit interest rate of 3.8%. Minimum
lease payments are approximately $3,181 annually. As discussed previously, our debt defaults and the
commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases are events of default under our capital leases.
Note 5: Derivative instruments
Overview
Our results of operations, financial condition and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market
prices of, and demand for, oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. These commodity prices are subject to wide
fluctuations and market uncertainties. To mitigate a portion of this exposure, we previously entered into various types
of derivative instruments, including commodity price swaps, enhanced price swaps, collars, put options, and basis
protection swaps. We also previously entered into crude oil derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our natural gas
liquids production.
Due to defaults under the master agreements governing our derivative contracts, all our outstanding derivative
positions were terminated in May 2016 and we have no outstanding derivative contracts as of June 30, 2016. As
discussed in “Note 6—Fair value measurements” all the counterparties to our derivative transactions are also financial
institutions within the lender group under our Credit Facility. The derivative master agreements with these
counterparties generally specify that a default under any of our indebtedness as well as any bankruptcy filing is an
event of default which may result in early termination of the derivative contracts. Proceeds from the early terminations,
inclusive of amounts receivable for previous settlements, totaled $119,303 and are reflected as “Accounts receivable—
derivative settlements” on our consolidated balance sheets. Of this amount, during the third quarter of 2016, $103,560
was utilized to offset outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility and the remainder was remitted to the Company.

While we are in default on our indebtedness and have a bankruptcy filing, we will no longer be able to represent that
we can comply with the credit default or bankruptcy covenants under any prospective derivative master agreements
and thus are not able to enter into new hedging transactions. While we expect to resume hedging upon a successful
emergence from bankruptcy, there can be no assurance that post-emergence we will be able to enter into new
derivative transactions at terms that are acceptable to us.
Effect of derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheets
All derivative financial instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. See “Note 6—Fair value
measurements” for additional information regarding fair value measurements. The estimated fair values of derivative
instruments are provided below. The carrying amounts of these instruments are equal to the estimated fair values.

Note 6: Fair value measurements
Fair value is defined by the FASB as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where available, fair value is based on
observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs
are not available, valuation models are applied. These valuation techniques involve some level of management
estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and
the instruments’ complexity.
21
Chaparral Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries
(Debtor in possession)
Condensed notes to consolidated financial statements (unaudited) – continued
(dollars in thousands, unless otherwise noted)
Fair value measurements are categorized according to the fair value hierarchy defined by the FASB. The hierarchical
levels are based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure the fair value of the assets
and liabilities as follows:
·Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement
date.
 ·Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and inputs other
than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability.
 ·Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any,
market activity for the asset or liability.
In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such
cases, the asset or liability is categorized based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its
entirety requires judgment, and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value
hierarchy.
Recurring fair value measurements
Our financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis consist of commodity derivative contracts (see
“Note 5—Derivative instruments”). Our derivative contracts classified as Level 2 consisted of commodity price swaps
and basis protection swaps, which are valued using an income approach. Future cash flows from the derivatives are
estimated based on the difference between the fixed contract price and the underlying published forward market price,
and are discounted at the LIBOR swap rate. Our derivative contracts classified as Level 3 consisted of three-way
collars, enhanced swaps, and purchased puts. The fair value of these contracts is developed by a third-party pricing
service using a proprietary valuation model, which we believe incorporates the assumptions that market participants
would have made at the end of each period. Observable inputs include contractual terms, published forward pricing
curves, and yield curves. Significant unobservable inputs are implied volatilities. Significant increases (decreases) in
implied volatilities in isolation would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. We review these
valuations and the changes in the fair value measurements for reasonableness. All derivative instruments are
recorded at fair value and include a measure of our own nonperformance risk for derivative liabilities or that of our
counterparties for derivative assets. As discussed in “Note 5—Derivative instruments,” due to defaults under the
master agreements governing our derivative contracts, all our outstanding derivative positions were terminated in May
2016 and we have no outstanding derivative contracts as of June 30, 2016.
The fair value hierarchy for our financial assets and liabilities is shown by the following table:

Nonrecurring fair value measurements
Asset retirement obligations. Additions to the asset and liability associated with our asset retirement obligations are
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Our asset retirement obligations consist of the estimated present value
of future costs to plug and abandon or otherwise dispose of our oil and natural gas properties and related facilities.
Significant inputs used in determining such obligations include estimates of plugging and abandonment costs, inflation
rates, discount rates, and well life, all of which are Level 3 inputs according to the fair value hierarchy. The estimated
future costs to dispose of properties added during the first six months of 2016 and 2015 were escalated using an
annual inflation rate of 2.42% and 2.91%, respectively, and discounted using our weighted average credit-adjusted
risk-free interest rate of 20.00% and 11.90%, respectively. These estimates may change based upon future inflation
rates and changes in statutory remediation rules. See “Note 7—Asset retirement obligations” for additional information
regarding our asset retirement obligations.
Fair value of other financial instruments
Our significant financial instruments, other than derivatives, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, accounts payable, and debt. We believe the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair values due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
The carrying value and estimated fair value of our debt at June 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, were as follows:

The fair value of our Senior Notes was estimated based on quoted market prices. We have not disclosed the fair value
of outstanding amounts under our Credit Facility as it is not practicable to obtain a reasonable estimate of such value
while the Company is in bankruptcy and the terms of the facility are being negotiated in conjunction with its
reorganization.
Counterparty credit risk
Our derivative contracts are executed with institutions, or affiliates of institutions, that are parties to our Credit Facility at
the time of execution, and we believe the credit risks associated with all of these institutions are acceptable. We do not
require collateral or other security from counterparties to support derivative instruments. Master agreements are in
place with each of our derivative counterparties which provide for net settlement in the event of default or termination of
the contracts under each respective agreement. As a result of the netting provisions, our maximum amount of loss
under derivative transactions due to credit risk is limited to the net amounts due from the counterparties under the
derivatives. Our loss is further limited as any amounts due from a defaulting
23

counterparty that is a lender, or an affiliate of a lender, under our senior secured revolving credit facility can be offset
against amounts owed to such counterparty lender under our senior secured revolving credit facility. As of
December 31, 2015, the counterparties to our open derivative contracts consisted of seven financial institutions, of
which all were subject to our rights of offset under our senior secured revolving credit facility.
The following table summarizes our derivative assets and liabilities which are offset in the consolidated balance
sheets under our master netting agreements. It also reflects the amounts outstanding under our senior secured
revolving credit facility that are available to offset our net derivative assets due from counterparties that are lenders
under our senior secured revolving credit facility.

We did not post additional collateral under any of these contracts as all of our counterparties are secured by the
collateral under our senior secured revolving credit facility. Payment on our derivative contracts would have been
accelerated in the event of a default on our senior secured revolving credit facility. The aggregate fair value of our
derivative liabilities subject to acceleration in the event of default was $1,158 at December 31, 2015. As discussed
previously, the defaults of our derivative master agreements resulted in the termination of all our contracts in May 2016
and resulted in amounts payable to us by our counterparties.

Note 8: Deferred compensation
Phantom Stock Plan and Restricted Stock Unit Plan
Effective January 1, 2004, we implemented a Phantom Unit Plan, which was revised on December 31, 2008 as the
Second Amended and Restated Phantom Stock Plan (the “Phantom Plan”), to provide deferred compensation to
certain key employees (the
24
Chaparral Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries
(Debtor in possession)
Condensed notes to consolidated financial statements (unaudited) – continued
(dollars in thousands, unless otherwise noted)
“Participants”). Under the Phantom Plan, awards vest at the end of five years, but may also vest on a pro-rata basis
following a Participant’s termination of employment with us due to death, disability, retirement or termination by us
without cause. Also, phantom stock will vest if a change of control event occurs. Phantom shares are cash-settled
within 120 days of the vesting date.
Effective March 1, 2012, we implemented a Non-Officer Restricted Stock Unit Plan (the “RSU Plan”) to create
incentives to motivate Participants to put forth maximum effort toward the success and growth of the Company and to
enable us to attract and retain experienced individuals who by their position, ability and diligence are able to make
important contributions to the Company’s success. The RSU Plan is intended to replace the Phantom Plan. Although
the Phantom Plan remains in effect, we do not expect to make any further awards under the Phantom Plan.
Under the RSU Plan, restricted stock units may be awarded to Participants in an aggregate amount of up to 2% of the
fair market value of the Company. Under the RSU Plan, awards generally vest in equal annual increments over a three
-year period. RSU awards may also vest following a Participant’s termination of employment in combination with the
occurrence of a change of control event, as specified in the RSU Plan. RSU awards are cash-settled, generally within
120 days of the vesting date.
A summary of our phantom stock and RSU activity during the six months ended June 30, 2016, is presented in the

Due to the severe decline in commodity pricing, which has resulted in a steep decline in our estimated proved
reserves, the estimated fair value per phantom share and RSU as of June 30, 2016, is $0.00. The weighted average
period until all remaining phantom shares and RSUs vest is 0.8 years.
2015 Cash Incentive Plan
We adopted the Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan (the “2015 Cash LTIP”) on August 7, 2015. The 2015 Cash LTIP
provides additional cash compensation to certain employees of the Company in the form of awards that generally vest
in equal annual increments over a four -year period. Since the awards do not vary according to the value of the
Company’s equity, the awards are not considered “stock-based compensation” under accounting guidance. We accrue
for the cost of each annual increment over the period service is required to vest. A summary of compensation expense
for the 2015 Cash LTIP is presented below:

2010 Equity Incentive Plan
We adopted the Chaparral Energy, Inc. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2010 Plan”) on April 12, 2010. The 2010 Plan
reserves a total of 86,301 shares of our class A common stock for awards issued under the 2010 Plan. All of our or our
affiliates’ employees, officers, directors, and consultants, as defined in the 2010 Plan, are eligible to participate in the
2010 Plan.
The awards granted under the 2010 Plan consist of shares that are subject to service vesting conditions (the “Time
Vested” awards) and shares that are subject to market and performance vested conditions (the “Performance Vested”
awards).

(dollars in thousands, unless otherwise noted)
The Time Vested awards vest in equal annual installments over the five -year vesting period, but may also vest on an
accelerated basis in the event of a transaction whereby CCMP Capital Investors II (AV-2), L.P., CCMP Energy I LTD.,
and CCMP Capital Investors (Cayman) II, L.P. (collectively “CCMP”) receive cash upon the sale of its class E common
stock (a “Transaction” as defined in the restricted stock agreements). The Performance Vested awards vest in the
event of a Transaction that achieves certain market targets as defined in the 2010 Plan. Any shares of Performance
Vested awards not vested on a Separation Date (as defined in the 2010 Plan) will be forfeited as of the Separation
Date.
Our 2010 Plan allows participants to elect, upon vesting of their Time Vested awards, to have us withhold shares
having a fair market value greater than the minimum statutory withholding amounts for income and payroll taxes that
would be due with respect to such vested shares. As a result of this provision, the Time Vested awards are classified
as liability awards under accounting guidance and remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period. The
Performance Vested awards are classified as equity awards and are not remeasured to fair value at the end of each
reporting period subsequent to grant date.
We have previously modified the vesting conditions of awards granted under the 2010 Plan. Please see “Note 11—
Stock-based compensation” in Item 8. Financial Statement and Supplementary Data of our Annual Report on Form 10-
K for the year ended December 31, 2015, for a discussion of the modifications.

During the six months ended June 30, 2016, and 2015, we repurchased and canceled 2,597 and 5,226 vested shares,
respectively. As of result of our bankruptcy, the estimated fair value of our Time Vested restricted awards was $0.00
per share, resulting in an aggregate intrinsic value of all outstanding unvested Time Vested restricted shares of $0 as
of June 30, 2016. We anticipate that our reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code will ultimately result
in the cancellation of all restricted shares.
Stock-based compensation cost
Compensation cost is calculated net of forfeitures, which are estimated based on our historical and expected turnover
rates. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, the stock-based compensation cost could be
different from what we have recorded in the current period.

A portion of stock-based compensation cost associated with employees involved in our acquisition, exploration, and
development activities has been capitalized as part of our oil and natural gas properties. The remaining cost is
reflected in lease operating and general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We
recognized stock-based compensation expense as follows for the periods indicated:

Our stock-based compensation expense for the six months ended June 30, 2016, and 2015 includes credits due to
forfeitures resulting from our workforce reductions in January 2016 and February 2015 and lower valuations of our
liability-based awards. As of June 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, accrued payroll and benefits payable included
$0 and $81, respectively, for stock-based compensation costs expected to be settled within the next twelve months.
Unrecognized compensation cost is approximately $2,115.
Note 9: Commitments and contingencies
Standby letters of credit (“Letters”) available under our Credit Facility are used in lieu of surety bonds with various
organizations for liabilities relating to the operation of oil and natural gas properties. We had Letters outstanding
totaling $828 as of June 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015. When amounts under the Letters are paid by the lenders,
interest accrues on the amount paid at the same interest rate applicable to borrowings under the Credit Facility. No
amounts were paid by the lenders under the Letters; therefore, we paid no interest on the Letters during the six months
ended June 30, 2016, or 2015.
Litigation and Claims
Naylor Farms, Inc., individually and as class representative on behalf of all similarly situated persons v. Chaparral
Energy, L.L.C. On June 7, 2011, an alleged class action was filed against us in the United States District Court for the
Western District of Oklahoma (“Naylor Farms Case”) alleging that we improperly deducted post-production costs from
royalties paid to plaintiffs and other royalty interest owners as categorized in the petition from crude oil and natural gas
wells located in Oklahoma. The purported class includes non-governmental royalty interest owners in oil and natural
gas wells we operate in Oklahoma. The plaintiffs have alleged a number of claims, including breach of contract, fraud,
breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and other claims and seek termination of leases, recovery of compensatory
damages, interest, punitive damages and attorney fees on behalf of the alleged class. We have responded to the
Naylor Farms petition, denied the allegations and raised arguments and defenses. Plaintiffs filed a motion for class
certification in October of 2015.  In addition, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment asking the court to
determine as a matter of law that natural gas is not marketable until it is in the condition and location to enter an
interstate pipeline.  Responsive briefs to both motions were filed in the fourth quarter of 2015.  The court has not ruled
on the motions, and no hearing has been scheduled.  On May 20, 2016, we filed a Notice of Suggestion of Bankruptcy,
informing the court that we had filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy
Code.  In response, on May 23, 2016, the court issued an order administratively closing the case, subject to reopening
depending on the disposition of the bankruptcy proceedings. On July 22, 2016, attorneys for the putative class filed a
motion in the Bankruptcy Court asking the court to lift the automatic stay and allow the case to proceed in the United
States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma. We do not object to lifting the automatic stay with regard to
this case for the limited purpose of allowing the District Court to rule on the pending motion for class certification.  We
are not currently able to estimate a reasonably possible loss or range of loss or what impact, if any, the Naylor Farms
Case will have on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows due to the preliminary status of the
matters, the complexity and number of legal and factual issues presented by the matter and uncertainties with respect
to, among other things, the nature of the claims and defenses, the potential size of the class, the scope and types of the
properties and agreements involved, and the ultimate potential outcome of the matter. Plaintiffs in the Naylor Farms
Case have indicated, if the class is certified, they seek damages in excess of $5,000 which may increase with the
passage of time, a majority of which would be comprised of interest. We dispute plaintiffs’ claims, dispute the case
meets the requirements for class certification, and are vigorously defending the case and opposing the motion.
Amanda Dodson, individually and as class representative on behalf of all similarly situated persons v. Chaparral
Energy, L.L.C. On May 10, 2013, Amanda Dodson, filed a complaint against us in the District Court of Mayes County,
Oklahoma, (“Dodson
27
Chaparral Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries
(Debtor in possession)
Condensed notes to consolidated financial statements (unaudited) – continued
(dollars in thousands, unless otherwise noted)
Case”) with allegation similar to those asserted in the Naylor Farms case related to post-production deductions, and
include claims for breach of contract, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and other claims and seek
termination of leases, recovery of compensatory damages, interest, punitive damages and attorney fees on behalf of
the alleged class. The alleged class includes non-governmental royalty interest owners in oil and natural gas wells we
operate in Oklahoma. We have responded to the Dodson petition, denied the allegations and raised a number of
affirmative defenses. At this time, a class has not been certified and discovery has not yet commenced. We are not
currently able to estimate a reasonable possible loss or range of loss or what impact, if any, the Dodson Case will
have on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows due to the preliminary status of the matters, the
complexity and number of legal and factual issues presented by the matter and uncertainties with respect to, among
other things, the nature of the claims and defenses, the potential size of the class, the scope and types of the properties
and agreements involved, and the ultimate potential outcome of the matter. We dispute plaintiffs’ claims, dispute that
the case meets the requirements for a class action and are vigorously defending the case.
Martha Donelson and John Friend, on behalf of themselves and on behalf of all similarly situated persons v. Chaparral
Energy, L.L.C. On August 11, 2014, an alleged class action was filed against us, as well as several other operators in
Osage County, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma, alleging claims on behalf of the
named plaintiffs and all similarly situated Osage County land owners and surface lessees. The plaintiffs challenged
leases and drilling permits approved by the Bureau of Indian Affairs without the environmental studies required under
the National Environmental Protection (NEPA). Plaintiffs assert claims seeking recovery for trespass, nuisance,
negligence and unjust enrichment. Relief sought includes declaring oil and natural gas leases and drilling permits
obtained in Osage County without a prior NEPA study void ab initio, removing us from all properties owned by the
class members, disgorgement of profits, and compensatory and punitive damages. On March 31, 2016, the Court
dismissed the case against the federal agencies named as defendants, and therefore against all defendants, as an
improper challenge under NEPA and the Administrative Procedures Act. On April 29, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a motion
to alter or amend the court’s opinion and vacate the judgment, arguing the court does have jurisdiction to hear the
claims and dismissal of the federal defendants does not require dismissal of the oil company defendants. Plaintiffs
also filed a motion to file an amended complaint to cure the deficiencies which the court found in the dismissed
complaint. Several defendants have filed briefs objecting to plaintiffs’ motions. On May 20, 2016, the Company filed a
Notice of Suggestion of Bankruptcy, informing the court that we had filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11
of the United States Bankruptcy Code, and has not responded to the plaintiffs’ motions. The court has not yet ruled. We
are not yet able to estimate a possible loss, or range of possible loss, if any. We dispute plaintiffs’ claims, dispute that
the case meets the requirements for a class action and are vigorously defending the case.
Lisa West and Stormy Hopson, individually and as class representatives on behalf of all similarly situated persons v.
Chaparral Energy, L.L.C. On February 18, 2016, an alleged class action was filed against us, as well as several other
operators in the District Court of Pottawatomie County, State of Oklahoma (“West Case”), alleging claims on behalf of
named plaintiffs and all similarly situated persons having an insurable real property interest in Cleveland, Lincoln,
McClain, Okfuskee, Oklahoma, Pontotoc, Pottawatomie and Seminole Counties, Oklahoma (the “Class Area”). The
plaintiffs allege the oil and gas operations conducted by us and the other defendants have induced or triggered
earthquakes in the Class Area. The plaintiffs are asking the court to require the defendants to reimburse plaintiffs and
class members for earthquake insurance premiums from 2011 through a future date defined as the time at which the
court determines there is no longer a risk that our activities induce or trigger earthquakes, as well as attorney fees and
costs and other relief. The plaintiffs have not asked for damages related to actual property damage which may have
occurred. We have responded to the petition, denied the allegations and raised a number of affirmative defenses. At
this time, a class has not been certified and discovery has not yet commenced. On March 18, 2016, the case was
removed to the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma under the Class Action Fairness Act
(“CAFA”). Plaintiffs moved to remand the matter to the Pottawatomie County court, and the court has set a hearing for
August 25, 2016, at which the plaintiffs will be permitted to submit evidence that remand is appropriate due to
exceptions to jurisdiction under CAFA. We and other defendants have filed motions to dismiss the West Case for lack
of subject matter jurisdiction, failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and other grounds. On May 20,
2016, we filed a Notice of Suggestion of Bankruptcy, informing the court that we had filed voluntary petitions for relief
under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. We are not currently able to estimate a reasonable possible
loss or range of loss or what impact, if any, the West Case will have on our financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows due to the preliminary status of the matters, the complexity and number of legal and factual issues
presented, and uncertainties with respect to, among other things, the nature of the claims and defenses, the potential
size of the class, the scope and types of the properties and agreements involved, and the ultimate potential outcome of
the matter. We dispute plaintiffs’ claims, dispute that the case meets the requirements for a class action, dispute the
remedies requested are available under Oklahoma law, and are vigorously defending the case.
We are involved in various other legal proceedings including, but not limited to, commercial disputes, claims from
royalty and surface owners, property damage claims, personal injury claims, employment claims, and other matters
which arise in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with
certainty, we do not expect any of them

individually to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, the
Bankruptcy Code provides an automatic stay of the proceedings listed above, as well as other claims and actions that
were or could have been brought prior to May 9, 2016.
We have numerous contractual commitments in the ordinary course of business including debt service requirements,
operating leases, capital leases and purchase obligations. Our operating leases primarily relate to CO2 recycle
compressors at our EOR facilities and office equipment while our capital leases are related to the sale and subsequent
leaseback of compressors. Our purchase obligations primarily relate to contracts for the purchase of CO2 and drilling
rig services. In May 2016, we took delivery of an additional CO2 compressor for which we have entered into an 84
month lease with monthly payments of $23. Other than additional debt borrowings during the year and our new
compressor lease discussed above, there were no material changes to our contractual commitments since
December 31, 2015.

ITEM 2.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS
The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and results of operations together
with our present financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial
statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report.
Statements in our discussion may be forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and
uncertainties. We caution that a number of factors could cause future production, revenues and expenses to differ
materially from our expectations.
Overview
Founded in 1988 and headquartered in Oklahoma City, we are a pure play Mid-Continent independent oil and natural
gas exploration and production company. We have capitalized on our sustained success in the Mid-Continent area in
recent years by expanding our holdings to become a leading player in the liquids-rich STACK play, which is home to
multiple oil-rich reservoirs including the Oswego, Meramec, Osage and Woodford formations. In addition, we have
significant holdings in the Mississippi Lime play and a leadership position in CO2 EOR where we are now the third
largest CO2 EOR operator in the United States based on the number of active projects. This position is underscored by
our activity in the North Burbank Unit in Osage County, Oklahoma, which is the single largest oil recovery unit in the
state. We are currently operating our business as debtors in possession in accordance with the applicable provisions
of the Bankruptcy Code.
Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and on
our ability to find, develop and acquire oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. The preparation
of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of our reported assets,
liabilities and proved oil and natural gas reserves. We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas
activities.
Generally, our producing properties have declining production rates. Our December 31, 2015, reserve estimates reflect
that our production rate on current proved developed producing reserve properties will decline at annual rates of
approximately 18%, 15%, and 10% for the next three years. To grow our production and cash flow, we must find,
develop and acquire new oil and natural gas reserves to replace those being depleted by production. Substantial
capital expenditures are required to find, develop and acquire oil and natural gas reserves.
Oil and natural gas prices fluctuate widely. We generally hedge a substantial portion of our expected future oil and
natural gas production to reduce our exposure to commodity price decreases. The prices we receive for our oil and
natural gas production affect our:
·cash flow available for capital expenditures;
 ·ability to borrow and raise additional capital;
 ·ability to service debt;
 ·quantity of oil and natural gas we can produce;
 ·quantity of oil and natural gas reserves; and
 ·operating results for oil and natural gas activities.
Chapter 11 Filings
The severe and sustained decline in oil and natural gas prices since mid-2014 has negatively impacted revenues,
earnings and cash flows, and our liquidity. As a result of our deteriorating liquidity, there was and continues to be
uncertainty regarding our ability to repay our outstanding debt obligations as they became due, especially in the event
of any acceleration of indebtedness, and hence substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
This doubt was expressed in the audit opinion of our annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2015, and constituted an event of default under our Credit Facility since the covenants under the facility
require us to deliver our annual financial statements without a going concern explanatory paragraph.
30
On March 1 and April 1, 2016, we elected not to make interest payments on our 8.25% Senior Notes and 9.875%
Senior Notes, respectively. Under the indenture governing these Senior Notes, the failure to make the interest
payments was subject to a 30-day grace period before constituting an event of default. We did not make either interest
payment on the Senior Notes within their respective 30-day grace periods and as a result, are currently in default
under the indentures governing these Senior Notes.
The defaults discussed above resulted in cross defaults on our remaining indebtedness and therefore subjected all our
debt to potential acceleration in the event that the outstanding amounts are called by our lenders.
Faced with these defaults, we entered into agreements (the “Forbearance Agreements”) with the lenders under our
Credit Facility and an ad hoc committee (the “Ad Hoc Committee”) of noteholders collectively holding more than 50%
of the Senior Notes outstanding to forbear from exercising remedies on account of the missed interest payments and
certain other alleged defaults specified in the Forbearance Agreements through and including May 1, 2016. While the
Forbearance Agreements were in effect, we continued to engage in good-faith arm’s-length negotiations regarding a
potential restructuring of the Credit Facility and the Senior Notes that would improve our liquidity. In the course of these
negotiations, the Company, the lenders under the Credit Facility, and the Ad Hoc Committee exchanged and
considered, with the assistance of their respective advisors, numerous restructuring proposals.
On May 9, 2016 (the “Petition Date”), Chaparral Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries including Chaparral Energy, L.L.C.,
Chaparral Resources, L.L.C., Chaparral Real Estate, L.L.C., Chaparral CO2 , L.L.C., CEI Pipeline, L.L.C., CEI
Acquisition, L.L.C., Green Country Supply, Inc., Chaparral Biofuels, L.L.C., Chaparral Exploration, L.L.C., Roadrunner
Drilling, L.L.C. (collectively, the “Chapter 11 Subsidiaries” and, together with Chaparral Energy, Inc., the “Debtors”)
filed voluntary petitions seeking relief under Title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the
Bankruptcy Court commencing cases for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the “Chapter 11 Cases”). Our
filing of the Chapter 11 Cases constitutes an additional event of default under our Credit Facility, Senior Notes, capital
leases and mortgage note.
We are currently operating our business as debtors in possession in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code. We have filed a variety of first day motions with the Bankruptcy Court that will allow us to continue to
operate our business without interruption. These motions are designed primarily to minimize the impact of our
bankruptcy filing on our operations, creditors and employees. The Bankruptcy Court has granted all first day motions
filed by us and our Chapter 11 Subsidiaries. As a result, we not only are able to conduct normal business activities and
pay the associated obligations for the period following our bankruptcy filing, we are also authorized to pay (subject to
caps applicable to payments of certain pre-petition obligations) pre-petition employee wages and benefits, pre-petition
amounts owed to certain lienholders and critical vendors and funds belonging to third parties, including royalty interest
holders and partners. During the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, all transactions outside the ordinary course of our
business require the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court. Final orders on the motions to satisfy our obligations to
certain third parties and to forward funds held by us that belong to third parties were granted on June 7, 2016.
Subject to certain exceptions, under the Bankruptcy Code, the filing of the bankruptcy petitions automatically enjoined,
or stayed, the continuation of most judicial or administrative proceedings or the filing of other actions against us or our
property to recover, collect or secure a claim arising prior to the Petition Date. Creditors are stayed from taking any
actions against us as a result of debt defaults, subject to certain limited exceptions permitted by the Bankruptcy Code.
For the duration of our Chapter 11 Cases, our operations and ability to develop and execute our business plan are
subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 process, as described in Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
As a result of these risks and uncertainties, the number of our outstanding shares of common stock and stockholders,
assets, liabilities, officers and/or directors could be significantly different following the outcome of the Chapter 11
Cases, and the description of our operations, properties and capital plans included in this quarterly report may not
accurately reflect our operations, properties and capital plans following our emergence from bankruptcy.
In particular, subject to certain exceptions, under the Bankruptcy Code, we may assume, assign, or reject certain
executory contracts and unexpired leases subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and certain other conditions.
Generally, the rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease is treated as a pre-petition breach of such
executory contract or unexpired lease and, subject to certain exceptions, relieves us of performing future obligations
under such executory contract or unexpired lease but entitles the contract counterparty or lessor to a pre-petition
general unsecured claim for damages caused by such deemed breach. Counterparties to such rejected contracts or
leases may assert unsecured claims in the Bankruptcy Court against the applicable Debtors’ estate for such damages.
Generally, the assumption of an executory contract or unexpired lease requires us to cure existing monetary defaults
under such executory contract or unexpired lease and provide adequate assurance of future performance. Accordingly,
any description of an executory contract or unexpired lease involving us in these financial statements, including where
applicable, a quantification of our obligations under any such executory contract or unexpired lease with us is qualified
by our rights to reject such executory contract or unexpired lease under the Bankruptcy Code.
31
On June 13, 2016, we filed a motion to set a bar date to assist with the claims reconciliation process.  The Bankruptcy
Court approved such motion on July 1, 2016, setting the bar date on August 19, 2016. Through the claims resolution
process, differences in amounts scheduled by us and claims filed by creditors will be investigated and resolved,
including through the filing of objections with the Bankruptcy Court where appropriate. In light of the potential number
and amount of claims filed, the claims resolution process may take considerable time to complete, and we expect that
it will continue after our emergence from bankruptcy. Accordingly, the ultimate number and amount of allowed claims is
not presently known, nor can the ultimate recovery with respect to allowed claims be presently ascertained.
In order to successfully exit bankruptcy, we will need to propose, and obtain confirmation by the Bankruptcy Court of, a
plan (or plans) of reorganization that satisfies the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code. A plan of reorganization
would, among other things, resolve our pre-petition obligations, set forth the revised capital structure of the newly
reorganized entity and provide for corporate governance subsequent to exit from bankruptcy. The timing of filing a plan
of reorganization by us will depend on the timing and outcome of numerous other ongoing matters in the Chapter 11
Cases. Although we expect to file a plan of reorganization that provides for emergence from bankruptcy as a going
concern, there can be no assurance at this time that we will be able to successfully develop, confirm and consummate
one or more plans of reorganization or other alternative restructuring transactions, that satisfies the conditions of the
Bankruptcy Code and is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, or that any such plan will be implemented successfully.
We have accounted for the bankruptcy in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 852, Reorganizations
(“ASC 852”), in preparing our financial statements. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern
basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and
commitments in the normal course of business. In accordance with ASC 852, our financial statements include amounts
classified as liabilities subject to compromise which represent pre-petition obligations that we anticipate will be
allowed as claims in our bankruptcy case. Our financial statements also reflect “Reorganization items, net” comprising
of any post-petition revenues, expenses, gains and losses that are the result of the reorganization of the business. We
have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs associated with the reorganization.
Price Uncertainty and the Full-Cost Ceiling Impairment
We deal with volatility in commodity prices primarily by maintaining flexibility in our capital investment program with a
diversified drilling portfolio and limited long-term commitments, which enables us to respond quickly to industry price
volatility, as well as by aggressively pursuing cost reductions in a market downturn. In the past, we have also dealt
with price volatility by hedging a substantial portion of our expected future oil and natural gas production to reduce our
exposure to commodity price decreases. As a result of our bankruptcy, all our commodity price derivatives have been
terminated and we do not have outstanding hedges at this time.
Price volatility also impacts our business through the full cost ceiling test calculation. The ceiling test calculation
dictates that we use the unweighted arithmetic average price of crude oil and natural gas as of the first day of each
month for the 12-month period ending on the balance sheet date. At year-end 2015, those prices were $50.28 per Bbl
for oil and $2.58 per MMBtu for natural gas, and at the end of the second quarter in 2016, they fell to $43.12 per Bbl
and $2.23 per MMBtu, respectively. As a result of the decline in average prices, we have recorded ceiling test write-
downs of $281.1 million so far during 2016. Since the prices used in the cost ceiling are based on a trailing 12-month
period, the full impact of a sudden price decline is not recognized immediately. As prices decline, the economic
performance of certain properties in the reserve estimate may deteriorate to the point that they are removed from the
proved reserve category, thus reducing the quantity and value of proved reserves. The use of a 12-month average will
tend to spread the impact of the price change on the financial statements over several reporting periods. While the
amount of any future impairment is generally difficult to predict, the average prices used in the ceiling test calculation at
September 30, 2016, will most likely be lower than the preceding quarter and will result in a further write-down in the
third quarter of 2016, which we expect to be in the range of $40 million to $60 million. Continued write-downs of oil and
natural gas properties may occur until such time as commodity prices recover, and remain at recovered levels, so as to
meaningfully increase the 12-month average price used in the ceiling test calculation. In addition to commodity prices,
our production rates, levels of proved reserves, estimated future operating expenses, estimated future development
costs, transfers of unevaluated properties and other factors will determine our actual ceiling test calculation and
impairment analyses in future periods.

Financial and Operating Highlights
Our financial and operating performance in the second quarter of 2016 includes the following highlights:
·We filed our Chapter 11 Cases with the Bankruptcy Court on May 9, 2016. Our balance sheet as of June 30, 2016,
·We filed our Chapter 11 Cases with the Bankruptcy Court on May 9, 2016. Our balance sheet as of June 30, 2016,
includes $1.3 billion in liabilities subject to compromise and we have incurred $5.4 million in reorganization
expenses related to our bankruptcy.
 ·Prior to the filing of our Chapter 11 Cases, we incurred liability management expenses of $3.8 million and $9.4 million
for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, in conjunction with efforts to restructure our debt and
in preparation for the bankruptcy filing.
 ·We recorded a ceiling test impairment of $203.2 million on our oil and natural gas properties driven  primarily by a
decrease in the average price utilized to estimate our reserves as well as an impairment on our non-producing
leasehold.
 ·All our outstanding derivative contracts were early-terminated in May 2016 due to defaults under the master
agreements governing those contracts. The proceeds from early terminations along with previously accrued
settlements totaled $119.3 million.  
 ·As a result of decreased capital spending for the drilling and completion of wells as well as natural decline, our total
net production declined 10% from the prior year quarter to 2,312 MBoe for the quarter ended June, 2016.
 ·Our commodity sales of $66.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, were 30% lower than the prior year
quarter primarily as a result of a decrease in pricing in 2016 coupled with the production decline discussed above.

We have recently realigned the plays within our E&P Areas to better highlight those areas where we are focusing our
operations and where our current and future capital will be spent. E&P Areas include the following plays: the STACK,
Mississippi Lime, Panhandle Marmaton and Legacy Production Areas. Please see Items 1. and 2. Business and
Properties of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, for a discussion of our plays.
Production in our E&P Areas decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the prior year
periods primarily due to the natural decline of our wells and the overall decrease in our drilling activity due to the
current low price environment. The production decline was most pronounced in our Panhandle Marmaton and
Mississippi Lime plays for which we have not allocated significant drilling capital in the past year and to a lesser
extent, in our Legacy Production Areas, for which we divested certain properties during the second and third quarters
of 2015. Meanwhile, production across our STACK play has increased as a result of our recent increased focus to drill
and develop the area.
33
Our EOR Project Areas include both currently Active EOR Projects and Potential EOR Projects. Potential EOR
Projects have no current EOR production or reserves while Active EOR Project areas include properties that have
proved EOR reserves, ongoing EOR operations, or that have an approved authorization for expenditure for EOR
operations. Production was relatively flat in our Active EOR Projects for the three and six month ended June 30, 2016,
compared to the prior year periods as increases from our North Burbank Unit as a result of continued development and
response offset production declines in the other units. Production decreases in our Potential EOR Projects were due to
natural decline and a lack of development due to the current pricing environment.
Revenues
Our commodity sales are derived from the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. These
revenues do not include the effects of derivative instruments and may vary significantly from period to period as a
result of changes in volumes of production sold or changes in commodity prices.

Our total commodity sales decreased significantly during the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016,
compared to the prior year periods as a result of decreases in the average prices and production volumes sold on all
commodities. Changes in our production compared to the prior year periods are discussed in the preceding section
above while the impact of price and production volume changes on our commodity sales is disclosed in the table
below.

Derivative activities
Our results of operations, financial condition and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market
prices of, and demand for, oil and natural gas. These commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market
uncertainties. To mitigate a portion of this exposure, in the past we have entered into various types of derivative
instruments, including commodity price swaps, costless collars, put options, and basis protection swaps.
Due to defaults under the master agreements governing our derivative contracts, all our outstanding derivative
positions were early-terminated in May 2016 and we have no outstanding derivative contracts as of June 30, 2016.
The master agreement defaults were the result of our debt defaults and our bankruptcy petition.  Proceeds from the
early terminations, inclusive of amounts receivable for previous settlements, totaled $119.3 million of which $103.6
million were utilized to offset outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility and the remainder was remitted to the
Company during the third quarter of 2016.
While we are in default on our indebtedness and have a bankruptcy filing, we will no longer be able to represent that
we can comply with the credit default or bankruptcy covenants under any prospective derivative master agreements
and thus are not able to enter into new hedging transactions. While we expect to resume hedging upon a successful
emergence from bankruptcy, there can be no assurance that post-emergence we will be able to enter into new
derivative transactions at terms that are acceptable to us.
The estimated fair values of our oil and natural gas derivative instruments are provided below. The associated
carrying values of these instruments are equal to the estimated fair values.

We do not apply hedge accounting to any of our derivative instruments. As a result, all gains and losses associated
with our derivative contracts are recognized immediately as “Non-hedge derivative gains (losses)” in our consolidated
statements of operations. The fluctuation in non-hedge derivative gains (losses) from period to period is due primarily
to the significant volatility of oil and natural gas prices and to changes in our outstanding derivative contracts during
these periods.

Lease operating costs are sensitive to changes in demand for field equipment, services, and qualified operational
personnel, which is driven by demand for oil and natural gas. However, the timing of changes in operating costs may
lag behind changes in commodity prices. Our EOR projects are more expensive to operate than traditional industry
operations due to the nature of operations along with the costs of recovery and recycling of CO2.
Lease operating expenses at both our E&P Areas and EOR Project Areas decreased on an absolute dollar basis
during the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the prior year periods primarily as a result
of cost reductions from third party service providers and improved operational efficiencies which included temporary
shut-in of marginal wells due to the current low price environment. Lower production volumes during the current year
period also contributed to the decrease in expense. Lease operating expenses per Boe for our EOR Project Areas
increased during the three months ended June 30, 2016, due to deferrals into the latter half of 2015 of workovers
originally scheduled for the second quarter of 2015. The deferrals were made in response to depressed industry
condition and resulted in lower than normal lease operating expense per Boe for the second quarter of 2015.

Production taxes per Boe
Production taxes generally change in proportion to commodity sales. Production taxes decreased during the three and
six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the prior year periods due to a significant reduction in revenues as a
result of declines in commodity prices in the current year coupled with production decreases. Also contributing to the
decline was a lower overall effective tax rate on revenues as a result of favorable tax rates for our EOR projects.

We adjust our DD&A rate on oil and natural gas properties each quarter for significant changes in our estimates of oil
and natural gas reserves and costs. Thus, our DD&A rate could change significantly in the future.
DD&A on oil and natural gas properties decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the prior
year quarter of which $5.5 million was due to a decrease in production and $17.5 million was due to a lower rate per
equivalent unit of production. DD&A on oil and natural gas properties decreased for the six months ended June 30,
2016, compared to the prior year period of which $17.3 million was due to a decrease in production and $38.6 million
was due to a lower rate per equivalent unit of production. Our DD&A rate per equivalent unit of production was lower
as the full cost amortization base, which consists of future development costs plus the carrying value of oil and natural
gas properties, is substantially lower in 2016 following $1.5 billion in ceiling-test impairments that were recorded in
2015 and $78 million recorded during the first quarter of 2016. In contrast, our reserve volumes are only marginally
lower. Both factors contribute to a lower DD&A rate.

Oil and natural gas asset impairments. The ceiling test calculation for our oil and natural gas properties dictates that
we use the unweighted arithmetic average price of crude oil and natural gas as of the first day of each month for the
12-month period ending on the balance sheet date. At year-end 2015, those prices were $50.28 per Bbl for oil and
$2.58 per MMBtu for natural gas, and at the end of the second quarter in 2016, they fell to $43.12 per Bbl and $2.23 per
MMBtu, respectively. As a result of the decline in average prices, we recorded ceiling test write-downs of $281.1
million so far during 2016 of which $203.2 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2016. The magnitude of our
ceiling test write-downs were also impacted by impairments of unevaluated non-producing leasehold, which resulted
in a transfer of amounts from unevaluated oil and natural gas properties to the full cost amortization base. Impairments
of non-producing leasehold of $54.8 million were recorded during the first half of 2016 compared to $96.2 million
during the first half of 2015. The impairments in 2016 and 2015 were recorded as a result of changes in our drilling
plans due to the low pricing environment and lower than expected results for certain exploratory activities which
resulted in certain undeveloped properties not expected to be developed before lease expiration.
Impairment of other assets. Our impairment losses for 2015 consists of write-downs of $6.0 million related to
impairments of our stacked drilling rigs and $7.3 million related to a lower of cost or market adjustment on our
equipment inventory. Our impairment loss for 2016 was due to a lower of cost or market adjustment on our equipment
inventory.
We own four stacked drilling rigs of which one was last utilized in January 2015 while the remaining three have been
stacked for three to four years. The deterioration in commodity prices that began in mid-2014 resulted in reduced
drilling activity causing the value of such equipment to decline while utilizing third party equipment became more cost
effective. This led to the Company impairing the value of the rigs to their estimated fair value. The industry conditions
described above also caused the demand for equipment utilized in drilling to decrease, resulting in lower market
prices for such equipment. At the same time, our utilization of certain inventory items at hand has decreased as a result
of the paring down of drilling activity. These factors resulted in the lower of cost or market adjustments we have
recorded on our equipment inventory.

Gross G&A expenses decreased during the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to prior year
periods, primarily due to lower compensation and benefits costs.  Compensation and benefits were lower due to lower
headcount subsequent to our workforce reduction and lower stock-based compensation expense resulting primarily
from declines in the value of the awards.
38
Capitalized exploration and development costs decreased between periods primarily due to the overall decrease in
G&A as well as a lower proportion of costs subject to capitalization as we have reduced our exploration, acquisition
and development activities in this low commodity price environment.
Cost reduction initiatives include expenses related to our efforts to reduce our capital, operating and administrative
costs in response to the deterioration of commodity prices. We implemented workforce reductions during both the
current year and prior year periods and therefore recorded one-time severance and termination benefits in connection
with the layoffs. The remaining cost reduction expense is a result of third party legal and professional services we have
engaged to assist in these initiatives as follows:

Liability management expenses include third party legal and professional service fees incurred from our activities to
restructure our debt and in preparation for our bankruptcy petition.
Our net G&A expenses on a Boe basis decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the
prior year periods primarily due to these same factors offset partially by the decrease in overall production volumes
between periods.
Income Taxes
Although we recorded net losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we did not record any
corresponding tax benefit as any deferred tax asset arising from the loss is currently not believed to be realizable and
is therefore reduced by a valuation allowance. At June 30, 2016, our valuation allowance is $570 million which
reduces our net deferred tax assets to zero value as we continue to believe that it is more likely than not that we will
not realize the deferred tax assets primarily related to our cumulative net operating losses. Income tax recognized for
the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, is a result of current Texas margin tax at a rate on gross revenues less
certain deductions. Please see “Note 10—Income Taxes” in Item 8. Financial Statement and Supplementary Data of
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which contains additional information about
our income taxes.

Total interest expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, was lower than the prior year periods as a
result of lower interest expense on our Senior Notes as we ceased accruing interest upon the filing of our bankruptcy
petition. This reduction in expense was partially offset by an increase in interest on our Credit Facility due to increased
levels of borrowing and a higher borrowing rate as interest is currently based on the higher default rate subsequent to
our debt defaults in March 2016. We also had a reduction in capitalized interest as a result of a lower carrying amount
of unevaluated non-producing leasehold subsequent to the leasehold impairments recorded in 2015 and 2016.
39
Senior Note issuance costs, discount and premium. In March 2016, we wrote off the remaining unamortized issuance
costs, premium and discount related to our Senior Notes for a net charge of approximately $17.0 million. These
deferred items are typically amortized over the life of the corresponding bond. However, as a result of not paying the
interest due on our 2021 Senior Notes by the end of our 30-day grace period on March 31, 2016, we triggered an
Event of Default on our Senior Notes. While uncured, the Event of Default effectively allowed the lender to demand
immediate repayment, thus shortening the life of our Senior Notes to the current period. As a result, we wrote off the
remaining balance of unamortized issuance costs, premium and discount.
Reorganization Items
Reorganization items reflect, where applicable, post-petition revenues, expenses, gains and losses incurred that are
incremental and a direct result of the reorganization of the business. We have incurred and will continue to incur
significant costs associated with the reorganization. The amount of these costs, which are being expensed as incurred,
are expected to significantly affect our results of operations. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we
have recorded $5,355 of expense for professional fees incurred as a result of the reorganization.
Liquidity and capital resources
Historically, our primary sources of liquidity have been cash generated from our operations, debt, private equity sales
and proceeds from asset dispositions. On February 11, 2016, we borrowed $141.0 million under our Credit Facility
which represented substantially all the remaining undrawn amount that was available under the Credit Facility at that
time. Since the Petition Date, our principal sources of liquidity have been limited to cash flow from operations and cash
on hand. In addition to the cash requirements necessary to fund ongoing operations, we have incurred and will
continue to incur significant professional fees and other costs in connection with the preparation and administration of
the Chapter 11 Cases.
Our liquidity is greatly impacted by commodity prices for which we have no control over. Beginning in mid 2014 and
continuing into the present, oil, natural gas and NGL prices declined significantly and are expected to fluctuate in the
future. Historically, we dealt with volatility in commodity prices primarily through the use of derivative contracts as part
of our commodity price risk management program. However, our debt defaults and our commencement of the Chapter
11 Cases were events of default under our derivative master agreements thereby providing our derivative
counterparties the right to terminate all our derivative positions. As discussed previously, all our outstanding derivative
contracts were terminated in May 2016 and we currently do not have any future production hedged. Proceeds from the
early terminations, inclusive of amounts receivable for previous settlements, totaled $119.3 million of which $103.6
million were utilized to offset outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility and the remainder was remitted to us
during the third quarter of 2016.
While we are in default on our indebtedness and have a bankruptcy filing, we will no longer be able to represent that
we can comply with the credit default or bankruptcy covenants under any prospective derivative master agreements
and thus are not able to enter into new hedging transactions. While we expect to resume hedging upon a successful
emergence from bankruptcy, there can be no assurance that post-emergence we will be able to enter into new
derivative transactions at terms that are acceptable to us.
As of June 30, 2016, we held cash and cash equivalents of $173.6 million. There are no assurances that our cash flow
from operations and cash on hand will be sufficient to continue to fund our operations or to allow us to continue as a
going concern until a Chapter 11 plan is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court or another alternative restructuring
transaction is approved by the Bankruptcy Court and consummated. Our long-term liquidity requirements, the
adequacy of our capital resources and our ability to continue as a going concern are difficult to predict at this time and
ultimately cannot be determined until a Chapter 11 plan has been confirmed, if at all, by the Bankruptcy Court. If our
future sources of liquidity are insufficient, we could face substantial liquidity constraints and be unable to continue as a
going concern and will likely be required to significantly reduce, delay or eliminate capital expenditures, implement
further cost reductions, seek other financing alternatives or seek the sale of some or all of our assets. If we are
unsuccessful in developing reserves and adding production through our capital program or our cost-cutting efforts are
too overreaching, the value of our oil and natural gas properties and our financial condition and results of operations
could be adversely affected.
There can be no assurances regarding our ability to successfully develop, confirm and consummate one or more plans
of reorganization or other alternative restructuring transactions that satisfies the conditions of the Bankruptcy Code
and, is approved by the Bankruptcy Court.

Our cash flows from operating activities is derived substantially from the production and sale of oil and natural gas. Our
cash flows from operating activities was a use of $8.6 million in the current period compared to inflows of $17.0 million
in the prior year period. The decrease in cash flows from operations was a result of lower revenues from price and
production declines coupled with costs we incurred in connection with our bankruptcy and to restructure our debt.
These decreases were partially offset by a $40.5 million reduction of interest paid from foregoing certain interest
payments on our Senior Notes coupled with decreases in our cash operating expenses.
When available, we use the net cash provided by operations to partially fund our acquisition, exploration and
development activities. However, with limited cash flows from operating activities, our acquisition, exploration and
development activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016, and 2015 were funded primarily by settlement
proceeds from our derivative instruments, borrowings from our Credit Facility and proceeds from asset dispositions.
Our cash flows from investing activities is comprised primarily of cash inflows from asset dispositions and derivative
settlement receipts offset by cash outflows for capital expenditures and derivative settlement payments.
Our actual costs incurred, including costs that we have accrued for during the six months ended June 30, 2016, and
our budgeted 2016 capital expenditures for oil and natural gas properties are summarized in the table below.

Net cash used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2016, was comprised of cash outflows for
capital expenditure of $88.9 million and cash inflows from derivative settlement receipts of $74.8 million and asset
dispositions of $0.5 million. Our cash outflows for capital expenditure is greater than our actual costs incurred for the
period, disclosed in the table above, as a result of payments in the current period for expenditures accrued at the end
of the prior year. Net cash used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2015, was comprised
primarily of cash outflows for capital expenditure of $222.7 million partially offset by derivative settlement receipts of
$118.7 million and proceeds from asset dispositions of $7.4 million. Capital expenditures were significantly higher in
the 2015 period as it included a significant paydown of accounts payable for expenditures accrued at the end 2014.
Cash flows from financing activities is comprised primarily of cash inflows from debt borrowings, offset by cash
outflows from repayments of debt and capital leases. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we borrowed $181.0
million on our debt and made repayments of $1.1 million on our debt and $1.2 million on our capital leases. During the
six months ended June 30, 2015, we borrowed $120.0 million on our debt and made repayments of $41.7 million on
our debt and $1.2 million on our capital leases.

Substantially all of our indebtedness is currently in default as a result of: (i) our commencement of the Chapter 11
Cases, (ii) our nonpayment of interest on the Senior Notes, (iii) the going concern audit opinion in our recent annual
financial statements and (iv) violation of certain financial covenants. Moreover, due to our commencement of the
Chapter 11 Cases, all of our indebtedness has been accelerated by operation of law. Please see “Note 6—Debt” in
Item 8. Financial Statement and Supplementary Data of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015, for a discussion of material terms governing our Senior Notes and Credit Facility.
Liabilities Subject to Compromise
Our financial statements include amounts classified as liabilities subject to compromise which represent our estimates
of pre-petition obligations that we anticipate will be allowed as claims in our bankruptcy case. These liabilities are
reported at the amounts expected to be allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, even if they may be settled for lesser
amounts. Because the uncertain nature of many of the potential claims has not been determined at this time, the
magnitude of such claims is not reasonably estimable at this time. We will continue to evaluate these liabilities during
the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases and adjust amounts as necessary. The magnitude of claims and or the
adjustments to such claims may be material.   Nothing herein constitutes an admission or waiver of any rights.

Credit Facility
Our Credit Facility, which matures on November 1, 2017, had an outstanding balance of $548.0 million as of June 30,
2016. In July 2016, the outstanding balance was reduced utilizing proceeds from the early termination of all our
outstanding derivative contracts, resulting in a balance of $445.1 million as of August 12, 2016. As a result of defaults,
there is currently no availability under this facility.
Availability under our Credit Facility was subject to a borrowing base which is set by the banks semi-annually on
May 1 and November 1 of each year. In addition, the lenders may request a borrowing base redetermination once
between each scheduled redetermination and in the event of early termination of our derivative contracts. We are
currently in negotiations, as part of our reorganization, regarding the structure of our exit financing upon emergence
from bankruptcy where we believe such financing will include a revolving credit facility subject to a borrowing base.
42
Subject to certain exceptions, under the Bankruptcy Code, the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases automatically
enjoined, or stayed, the continuation of most judicial or administrative proceedings or the filing of other actions against
us or our property to recover, collect or secure a claim arising prior to the Petition Date. Creditors are stayed from
taking any actions against us as a result of debt defaults, subject to certain limited exceptions permitted by the
Bankruptcy Code. There can be no assurances that the agent and lenders will consensually agree to a restructuring of
the Credit Facility. Any proposed non-consensual restructuring of the Credit Facility could result in substantial delay in
emergence from bankruptcy and there can be no assurances that the Bankruptcy Court would approve such proposed
non-consensual restructuring. During the Chapter 11 Cases, we expect to remain current on our interest payments
under the Credit Facility to the extent required by order of the Bankruptcy Court.
Capital Leases
During 2013, we entered into lease financing agreements with U.S. Bank National Association for $24.5 million
through the sale and subsequent leaseback of existing compressors owned by us. The carrying value of these
compressors is included in our oil and natural gas full cost pool. The lease financing obligations are for 84 -month
terms and include the option to purchase the equipment for a specified price at 72 months as well as an option to
purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term for its then-current fair market value. Lease payments related to
the equipment are recognized as principal payments and interest expense. As discussed previously, our debt defaults
and the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases are events of default under our capital leases.
Contractual Obligations
We have numerous contractual commitments in the ordinary course of business including debt service requirements,
operating leases, capital leases and purchase obligations. Our operating leases primarily relate to CO2 recycle
compressors at our EOR facilities and office equipment while our capital leases are related to the sale and subsequent
leaseback of compressors. Our purchase obligations primarily relate to contracts for the purchase of CO2 and drilling
rig services. In May 2016, we took delivery of an additional CO2 compressor for which we have entered into an 84
month lease with monthly payments of $23,000.
Other than additional debt borrowings during the year and our new compressor lease discussed above, there were no
material changes to our contractual commitments since December 31, 2015.

·The increase in cash was primarily due to the $181.0 million drawing under our Credit Facility during the first quarter
of 2016 which represented substantially all the remaining undrawn amount that was available under the Credit
Facility at that time. 
 ·The increase in our derivative settlement receivable was a result of the early termination of all outstanding derivatives
in May 2016 due to default under the master agreements governing those derivatives. Of this amount, during the third
quarter of 2016, $103.6 million was utilized to offset outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility and the
remainder was remitted to us.
 ·The decline in oil and natural gas properties was a result of the ceiling test impairments recorded during the year.
 ·Both our asset and liability balances on deferred income taxes were reduced as part of an offset allowed with our
early adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of
Deferred Taxes (ASU 2015-17). The accounting update allows all deferred taxes within a single jurisdiction to be
aggregated and netted within noncurrent assets or noncurrent liabilities, which in the Company’s case results in zero
deferred taxes on our balance sheet.
 ·Other assets decreased due to our write-off of debt issuance costs in conjunction with the defaults on our Senior
Notes.
 ·Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased due to a decrease in our drilling and development activity and a
reclassification of certain balances to liabilities subject to compromise.
 ·Long-term debt and capital leases, classified as current decreased due to the reclassification of our Senior Notes to
liabilities subject to compromise.
 ·Liabilities subject to compromise represent pre-petition obligations that we anticipate will be allowed as claims in our
bankruptcy case.
Non-GAAP financial measure and reconciliation
Management uses adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental financial measurement to evaluate our operational trends.
Items excluded generally represent non-cash adjustments, the timing and amount of which cannot be reasonably
estimated and are not considered by management when measuring our overall operating performance. In addition,
adjusted EBITDA is generally consistent with the Consolidated EBITDAX calculation that is used in the covenant ratio
required under our Credit Facility described in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We consider compliance with this
covenant to be material. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of our
business and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as an indicator of our operating performance,
as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, or as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is not defined
under GAAP and, accordingly, it may not be a comparable measurement to those used by other companies.
We define adjusted EBITDA as net income, adjusted to exclude (1) asset impairments, (2) interest and other financing
costs, net of capitalized interest, (3) income taxes, (4) depreciation, depletion and amortization, (5) non-cash change in
fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments, (6) interest income, (7) stock-based compensation expense, (8) gain or
loss on disposed assets, (9) upfront premiums paid on settled derivative contracts, (10) impairment charges, (11)
expenses associated with our cost reduction initiatives, transition, business optimization and other restructuring
charges not to exceed $25.0 million on a cumulative basis, (12) other significant, unusual non-cash charges and (13)
proceeds from any early monetization of derivative contracts with a scheduled maturity date more than 12 months
following the date of such monetization—this exclusion is consistent with our prior treatment, for EBITDA reporting, of
large monetization of derivative contracts.

ITEM 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Commodity prices. Our financial condition, results of operations and capital resources are highly dependent upon the
prevailing market prices of, and demand for, oil and natural gas. These commodity prices are subject to wide
fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a variety of factors that are beyond our control. We cannot predict future oil
and natural gas prices with any degree of certainty. Sustained declines in oil and natural gas prices may adversely
affect our financial condition and results of operations, and may also reduce the amount of net oil and natural gas
reserves that we can produce economically. Any reduction in reserves, including reductions due to price fluctuations,
can reduce our borrowing base under our Credit Facility and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to obtain
capital for our acquisition, exploration and development activities. Based on our production for the six months ended
June 30, 2016, our gross revenues from oil and natural gas sales would change approximately $3.2 million for each
$1.00 change in oil and natural gas liquid prices and $0.8 million for each $0.10 change in natural gas prices.
In the past, we have entered into various types of derivative instruments, including commodity price swaps, costless
collars, put options, and basis protection swaps to mitigate a portion of our exposure to fluctuations in commodity
prices. Our debt defaults and the commencement of our Chapter 11 Cases were events of default under our derivative
master agreements thereby providing our derivative counterparties the right to terminate all our derivative positions. As
a result, all derivative positions were terminated in May, 2016. While we are in default on our indebtedness and have a
bankruptcy filing, we will no longer be able to represent that we can comply with the credit default or bankruptcy
covenants under any prospective derivative master agreements and thus are not able to enter into new hedging
transactions. We intend to resume hedging once we emerge from bankruptcy. Please see “Liquidity and capital
resources” in Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a
discussion on the impact of our master agreement defaults on our derivative portfolio and our ability to hedge.
Interest rates. All of the outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility as of June 30, 2016, are subject to market
rates of interest as determined from time to time by the banks. As of April 1, 2016, borrowings bear interest at a default
rate which is based on the Alternate Base Rate, as defined under the Credit Facility, plus a margin and plus an
additional 2.00%. Any increases in these rates
45
can have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow. Assuming a constant debt level of
$550.0 million, the cash flow impact for a 12-month period resulting from a 100 basis point change in interest rates
would be $5.5 million.
ITEM 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure controls and procedures
We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to us, including
our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and to other members of
senior management and the board of directors. Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this
quarterly report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are effective to ensure
that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and are
effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in such reports is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.
Internal control over financial reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal
quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting. We may make changes in our internal control procedures from time to time.
PART II—OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Please see “Note 9—Commitments and contingencies” in Item 1. Financial Statements of this report for a discussion of
our material legal proceedings. In our opinion, there are no other material pending legal proceedings to which we are a
party or of which any of our property is the subject. However, due to the nature of our business, certain legal or
administrative proceedings may arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these
legal matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect them to have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS
We are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with Chapter 11 Cases.
For the duration of our Chapter 11 Cases, our operations and our ability to develop and execute our business plan,
and our continuation as a going concern, are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy. These
risks include the following:
·our ability to develop, confirm and consummate a Chapter 11 plan or alternative restructuring transaction, including a
sale of all or substantially all of our assets;
 ·our ability to obtain court approval with respect to motions filed in the Chapter 11 Cases from time to time;
 ·our ability to maintain our relationships with our suppliers, service providers, customers, employees, and other third
parties;
 ·our ability to maintain contracts that are critical to our operations;
 ·our ability to fund and execute our business plan;
 ·the ability of third parties to seek and obtain court approval to terminate contracts and other agreements with us;
 ·the ability of third parties to seek and obtain court approval to terminate or shorten the exclusivity period for us to
propose and confirm a Chapter 11 plan, to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee, or to convert the Chapter 11 Cases to
proceedings under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code; and
 ·the actions and decisions of our creditors and other third parties who have interests in our Chapter 11 Cases that may
be inconsistent with our plans.
These risks and uncertainties could affect our business and operations in various ways. For example, negative events
associated with our Chapter 11 Cases could adversely affect our relationships with our suppliers, service providers,
customers, employees, and other third parties, which in turn could adversely affect our operations and financial
condition. Also, we need the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court for transactions outside the ordinary course of
business, which may limit our ability to respond timely to certain
46
events or take advantage of certain opportunities. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with our Chapter
11 Cases, we cannot accurately predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events that occur during our Chapter 11
Cases will have on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We believe it is highly likely that the shares of our existing common stock will be cancelled in our Chapter 11 Cases.
We have a significant amount of indebtedness that is senior to our existing common stock in our capital structure. As a
result, we believe that it is highly likely that the shares of our existing common stock will be cancelled in our Chapter
11 Cases and investors will receive little to no recovery on account of such shares.
Operating under Bankruptcy Court protection for a long period of time may harm our business.
Our future results are dependent upon the successful confirmation and implementation of a plan of reorganization. A
long period of operations under Bankruptcy Court protection could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. So long as the proceedings related to the Chapter 11 Cases
continue, our senior management will be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort dealing with the
reorganization instead of focusing exclusively on our business operations. A prolonged period of operating under
Bankruptcy Court protection also may make it more difficult to retain management and other key personnel necessary
to the success and growth of our business. In addition, the longer the proceedings related to the Chapter 11 Cases
continue, the more likely it is that our customers and suppliers will lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our
businesses successfully and will seek to establish alternative commercial relationships.
Furthermore, so long as the proceedings related to the Chapter 11 Cases continue, we will be required to incur
substantial costs for professional fees and other expenses associated with the administration of the Chapter 11
proceeding. The Chapter 11 proceedings may also require us to seek debtor-in-possession financing to fund
operations. If we are unable to obtain such financing on favorable terms or at all, our chances of successfully
reorganizing our business may be seriously jeopardized, the likelihood that we instead will be required to liquidate our
assets may be enhanced, and, as a result, any securities in the Debtor could become further devalued or become
worthless.
Furthermore, we cannot predict the ultimate amount of all settlement terms for the liabilities that will be subject to a
plan of reorganization. Even once a plan of reorganization is approved and implemented, our operating results may be
adversely affected by the possible reluctance of prospective lenders and other counterparties to do business with a
company that recently emerged from Chapter 11 proceedings.
We may not be able to obtain confirmation of a Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization.
To emerge successfully from Bankruptcy Court protection as a viable entity, we must meet certain statutory
requirements with respect to adequacy of disclosure with respect to a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization (“Plan”), solicit
and obtain the requisite acceptances of such a plan and fulfill other statutory conditions for confirmation of such a plan,
which have not occurred to date. The confirmation process is subject to numerous, unanticipated potential delays,
including a delay in the Bankruptcy Court’s commencement of the confirmation hearing regarding our plan.
We may not receive the requisite acceptances of constituencies in the proceedings related to the Chapter 11
proceedings to confirm our Plan. Even if the requisite acceptances of our Plan are received, the Bankruptcy Court may
not confirm such a plan. The precise requirements and evidentiary showing for confirming a plan, notwithstanding its
rejection by one or more impaired classes of claims or equity interests, depends upon a number of factors including,
without limitation, the status and seniority of the claims or equity interests in the rejecting class (i.e., secured claims or
unsecured claims, subordinated or senior claims, preferred or common stock).
If a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is not confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, it is unclear whether we would be able
to reorganize our business and what, if anything, holders of claims against us would ultimately receive with respect to
their claims.
Even if a Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization is consummated, we will continue to face risks.
Even if a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is consummated, we will continue to face a number of risks, including
certain risks that are beyond our control, such as further deterioration or other changes in economic conditions,
changes in our industry, potential revaluing of our assets due to Chapter 11 proceedings, changes in consumer
demand for, and acceptance of, our oil and gas and increasing expenses. Some of these concerns and effects typically
become more acute when a case under the Bankruptcy Code continues for a protracted period without indication of
how or when the case may be completed. As a result of these risks and others, there is no guaranty that a confirmed
Chapter 11 plan of reorganization will achieve our stated goals.
47
In addition, at the outset of the Chapter 11 proceedings, the Bankruptcy Code gives the Debtor the exclusive right to
propose the Plan and prohibits creditors, equity security holders and others from proposing a plan. We have currently
retained the exclusive right to propose the Plan. If the Bankruptcy Court terminates that right, however, or the
exclusivity period expires, there could be a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve confirmation of the Plan in
order to achieve our stated goals.
Furthermore, even if our debts are reduced or discharged through the Plan, we may need to raise additional funds
through public or private debt or equity financing or other various means to fund our business after the completion of
the proceedings related to the Chapter 11 Cases. Adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be
available on favorable terms.
We have substantial liquidity needs and may be required to seek additional financing. If we are unable to obtain
financing on satisfactory terms or maintain adequate liquidity, our ability to replace our proved reserves or to maintain
current production levels and generate revenue will be limited.
Our principal sources of liquidity historically have been cash flow from operations, sales of oil and natural gas
properties, borrowings under our Credit Facility, and issuances of debt securities. Our capital program will require
additional financing above the level of cash generated by our operations to fund growth. If our cash flow from
operations remains depressed or decreases as a result of lower commodity prices or otherwise, our ability to expend
the capital necessary to replace our proved reserves, maintain our leasehold acreage or maintain current production
may be limited, resulting in decreased production and proved reserves over time. In addition, drilling activity may be
directed by our partners in certain areas and we may have to forfeit acreage if we do not have sufficient capital
resources to fund our portion of expenses.
We face uncertainty regarding the adequacy of our liquidity and capital resources and have extremely limited, if any,
access to additional financing. In addition to the cash requirement necessary to fund ongoing operations, we have
incurred significant professional fees and other costs in connection with preparation for the Chapter 11 proceedings
and expect that we will continue to incur significant professional fees and costs throughout our Chapter 11
proceedings. We cannot assure you that cash on hand and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to continue to
fund our operations and allow us to satisfy our obligations related to Chapter 11 Cases until we are able to emerge
from our Chapter 11 proceedings.
Our liquidity, including our ability to meet our ongoing operational obligations, is dependent upon, among other things;
(i) our ability to comply with the terms and conditions of any cash collateral order entered by the Bankruptcy Court in
connection with the Chapter 11 proceedings, (ii) our ability to maintain adequate cash on hand, (iii) our ability to
generate cash flow from operations, (iv) our ability to develop, confirm and consummate a Chapter 11 plan or other
alternative restructuring transaction, and (v) the cost, duration and outcome of the Chapter 11 proceedings. Our ability
to maintain adequate liquidity depends in part upon industry conditions and general economic, financial, competitive,
regulatory and other factors beyond our control. In the event that cash on hand and cash flow from operation is not
sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, we may be required to seek additional financing. We can provide no assurance
that additional financing would be available or, if available, offered to us on acceptable terms. Our access to additional
financing is, and for the foreseeable future will likely continue to be, extremely limited if it is available at all. Our long-
term liquidity requirements and the adequacy of our capital resources are difficult to predict at this time.
In certain instances, a Chapter 11 case may be converted to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.
If the Bankruptcy Court finds that it would be in the best interest of creditors and/or the Company, the Bankruptcy Court
may convert our Chapter 11 bankruptcy case to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In such event, a
Chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate the Debtors’ assets for distribution in accordance with the
priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code. We believe that liquidation under Chapter 7 would result in significantly
smaller distributions being made to our creditors than those provided for in a Chapter 11 plan because of (i) the
likelihood that the assets would have to be sold or otherwise disposed of in a disorderly fashion over a short period of
time rather than reorganizing or selling in a controlled manner the Company’s businesses as a going concern, (ii)
additional administrative expenses involved in the appointment of a Chapter 7 trustee, and (iii) additional expenses
and claims, some of which would be entitled to priority, that would be generated during the liquidation and from the
rejection of leases and other executory contracts in connection with cessation of operations.
We may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in the Chapter 11 proceedings, which could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and results or operations.
The Bankruptcy Code provides that the confirmation of a plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially
all debts arising prior to confirmation. With few exceptions, all claims that arose prior to May 10, 2016, or before
confirmation of the plan of reorganization (i) would be subject to compromise and/or treatment under the plan of
reorganization and/or (ii) would be discharged in accordance with the terms of the plan of reorganization. Any claims
not ultimately discharged through a plan of reorganization could be asserted against the reorganized entities and may
have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations on a post-reorganization basis.
48
Our financial results may be volatile and may not reflect historical trends.
During the Chapter 11 proceedings, we expect our financial results to continue to be volatile as asset impairments,
asset dispositions, restructuring activities and expenses, contract terminations and rejections, and claims assessments
significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our historical financial performance is likely not
indicative of our financial performance after the date of the bankruptcy filing.
In addition, if we emerge from Chapter 11, the amounts reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements may
materially change relative to historical consolidated financial statements, including as a result of revisions to our
operating plans pursuant to a plan of reorganization. We also may be required to adopt fresh start accounting, in which
case our assets and liabilities will be recorded at fair value as of the fresh start reporting date, which may differ
materially from the recorded values of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our financial results
after the application of fresh start accounting also may be different from historical trends.
Transfers of our equity, or issuances of equity in connection with our Chapter 11 proceedings, may impair our ability to
utilize our federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards in future years.
Under federal income tax law, a corporation is generally permitted to deduct from taxable income net operating losses
carried forward from prior years. We have federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $441 million as of
December 31, 2015. Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income and to
reduce federal income tax liability is subject to certain requirements and restrictions. If we experience an “ownership
change,” as defined in section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, then our ability to use our net operating loss
carryforwards may be substantially limited, which could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of
operations. Generally, there is an “ownership change” if one or more stockholders owning 5% or more of a
corporation’s common stock have aggregate increases in their ownership of such stock of more than 50 percentage
points over the prior three-year period. Following the implementation a plan of reorganization, it is possible that an
“ownership change” may be deemed to occur. Under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, absent an applicable
exception, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the amount of its net operating losses that may be
utilized to offset future taxable income generally is subject to an annual limitation.
