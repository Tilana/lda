</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment undertook a visit to Indonesia from 10 to 23 November 2007. He expresses his 
appreciation to the Government for the cooperation it extended to him. The report contains a 
study of the legal and factual aspects regarding the situation of torture and ill-treatment in 
Indonesia.  
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur notes the commitment by the current Government to uphold and 
promote human rights and, resulting from this, the considerable progress made since the Suharto 
era ended in 1998. He is also aware of the vastness of the country, resulting in economic, cultural 
and religious heterogeneity.  
</p>
<p> These regional discrepancies are also reflected with regard to the situation of torture and 
ill-treatment in places of detention. Whereas the Special Rapporteur concludes that torture in 
police stations is routine practice in Jakarta and other metropolitan areas of Java, including 
Yogyakarta, the situation with regard to torture and ill-treatment in police custody is better in 
rural areas. Nevertheless, he has also received some serious allegations of ill-treatment in some 
rural police stations. A number of cases of ill-treatment were reported to the Special Rapporteur 
in both pretrial detention houses and prisons. In violation of international human rights law, 
corporal punishment is regularly applied in several prisons. 
</p>
<p> Police cells in most cases meet international standards for short-term detention, but are not 
adapted to holding persons for long periods. Detention in such conditions for up to 61 days, as 
practiced in Indonesia, amounts to degrading and inhuman treatment. The conditions of 
detention in prisons also vary from region to region. The prisons visited by the Special 
Rapporteur in Jakarta were severely overcrowded, which leads to difficulties in terms of hygiene 
and security and provides a fertile soil for corruption. Other prisons outside of Jakarta showed 
acceptable levels of space for each prisoner and were overall characterized by a liberal spirit of 
the management. However, the Special Rapporteur was concerned about the standard use of 
&#8220;quarantine&#8221; cells (similar to punishment cells) for newly arrived detainees. Most of theses cells 
were not in line with international standards and prolonged detention in these cells amounts to 
inhuman and degrading treatment. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur received complaints 
regarding the restricted access to medical care and the quality of the food.  
</p>
<p> With regard to the country&#8217;s legal framework, the Special Rapporteur regrets that 
Indonesia has not outlawed torture under its criminal legislation. Indonesian law does not contain 
an explicit prohibition of torture. This, combined with the absence of procedural safeguards 
against torture, the lack of independent monitoring mechanisms and of effective complaints 
mechanisms results in a system of quasi-total impunity.  
</p>
<p> In light of the above, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government of 
Indonesia fully implement its obligations under international human rights law. In particular, he 
urges the Government to criminalize torture, publicly condemn it and fight impunity; to prevent 
the use of excessive violence during police and military actions; and to ensure that the criminal 
justice system is non-discriminatory, inter alia through combating corruption. Furthermore, he </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/3/Add.7 
  page 3 
 
</p>
<p>calls upon the Government to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture 
(OPCAT) and to establish a National Preventive Mechanism (NPM) mandated to conduct 
independent and unannounced monitoring of places of detention; and to introduce in its 
legislation safeguards against torture and ensure that they are implemented. The Special 
Rapporteur encourages the Government to continue its efforts to improve detention conditions, 
in particular with a view to providing health care. In addition, he recommends that special 
attention be paid to combating and preventing violence against women and children and that the 
age of criminal responsibility be raised. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur calls upon the international community to assist the Government 
of Indonesia in its fight against torture by providing financial and technical support. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment of the Human Rights Council, Manfred Nowak, undertook a visit to Indonesia 
from 10 to 23 November 2007, at the invitation of the Government.  
</p>
<p>2. The purpose of the visit was twofold: to assess the situation of torture and ill-treatment in 
the country, and to offer assistance to the Government in its efforts to improve the administration 
of justice, including the police and prison sectors. The invitation of the Government to the 
Special Rapporteur illustrates the willingness of Indonesia to open itself up to independent and 
objective scrutiny of its human rights situation. He notes that Indonesia has come a long way in 
overcoming the legacy of the Suharto era and that certain reforms have been implemented after 
the visit of a previous Special Rapporteur on torture to Indonesia in 1991 in terms of illegal 
detention and the handling of internal conflicts.<b>1</b> He encourages the Government to implement 
the recommendations contained in this report with a view to further improving the situation 
regarding torture and ill-treatment.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur held meetings with the Speaker of Parliament, the Minister for 
Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Law and Human Rights and the Attorney-General. In addition, 
the Special Rapporteur met with the Director-General for Corrections and the Director-General 
for Human Rights; officials from the Ministry of Home Affairs, from the Coordinating Ministry 
for Political, Legal and Security Affairs and from the Social Affairs Ministry; and senior 
commanders from the Headquarters of the Armed Forces, and from the National Police. 
</p>
<p>4. Besides meeting with the Government, the Special Rapporteur met with representatives of 
the National Human Rights Commission (Komnas HAM), the National Commission on Violence 
Against Women (Komnas Perempuan) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). In 
addition, the Special Rapporteur held meetings with the United Nations Country Team, the 
diplomatic community, and representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross 
(ICRC). Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur participated in a seminar on Indonesia&#8217;s 
anticipated accession to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OPCAT), 
jointly organized by the Association for the Prevention of Torture (APT) and ELSAM (Institute 
for Policy Research and Advocacy) in cooperation with the Government.   
</p>
<p>5. He visited prisons, police posts, military detention facilities and a social care centre in 
Jakarta, Central Java, Papua, Sulawesi and Bali<b>2</b> (see also appendix).

<p>6. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and other 
authorities for their cooperation. As with any anti-torture monitoring mechanism, the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s fact-finding is fully effective only if he enjoys unrestricted freedom of inquiry, 
including by conducting visits to places of detention without prior announcement and 
interviewing detainees in private.  In this context, the Special Rapporteur regrets that the efforts 
of Government officials to monitor his movements throughout the country restricted his ability to 
carry out unannounced visits to places of detention. He further regrets that in a small number of 
instances (Police Headquarters Jakarta, Poltabes Yogyakarta, Military Prison Abepura), his 
unimpeded access to places of detention was compromised, including his ability to carry out 
private interviews with detainees, in contravention of his terms of reference.  While overall 
access was by and large granted, such interferences carry the risk of distorting an objective 
assessment of the day-to-day practices in places of detention. 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur further expresses his gratitude to the United Nations Resident 
Coordinator a.i. in Jakarta and the entire United Nations team for the excellent assistance prior to

</p>
<p>8. On 28 January 2008, a preliminary version of this report was sent to the Government. 
On 4 March 2008 the Government indicated that it will not provide any comments except for the 
Note Verbal to be found in appendix 2. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  International level 
</b></p>
<p>9. Indonesia is party to the major United Nations human rights treaties outlawing torture and 
other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child (CRC), the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women (CEDAW),  the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination (CERD) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
(ICESCR). Furthermore, Indonesia is party to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 but not the 
Additional Protocols. According to section 7 (2) of Indonesia&#8217;s Law 39/1999 on Human Rights, 
the provisions of international human rights treaties ratified or acceded form part of the domestic 
law. 
</p>
<p>10. Indonesia has not recognized the competence of the Committee against Torture to receive 
communications from other States parties as well as from or on behalf of individuals under 
articles 21 and 22 of the Convention against Torture, respectively. Indonesia submitted a 
reservation under article 30 of the Convention, meaning that Indonesia is not bound to settle any 
disputes between States parties before the International Court of Justice. Indonesia has also not 
signed OPCAT, but is committed to its ratification, as outlined in Indonesia&#8217;s National Human 
Rights Action Plan (2004-2009), during the course of 2008. Indonesia is not party to the 
Optional Protocols of the ICCPR and to the Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearances. Furthermore, the country has not ratified the Rome Statute, however, 
it has publicly stated that it intents to do so in 2008.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Domestic level 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Constitutional protection of human rights, including the prohibition 
of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment 
</b></p>
<p>11. Indonesia&#8217;s Constitution, as amended in 2002, guarantees a broad set of economic, social 
and cultural as well as civil and political rights. Chapter XA, entitled &#8220;Human Rights&#8221; lists 
inter alia the right to life (art. 28A), the right to education (art. 28C), and the freedom of belief 
(art. 28E). It furthermore provides for the right not to be discriminated against upon any grounds 
(art. 28I (2)). Article 28I (4) stresses that it is the State&#8217;s, especially the Government&#8217;s, 
responsibility to protect, advance, uphold and fulfil human rights.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.7 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>12. With regard to the protection of the physical and mental integrity of a person, 
article 28G (2) stipulates that &#8220;each person has the right to be free from torture or inhuman and 
degrading treatment ...&#8221;. Acknowledging the absolute and non-derogable character of the 
prohibition of torture, article 28I (1) explicitly states that &#8220;the rights to life, to remain free from 
torture, to freedom of thought and conscience, to adhere to a religion, the right not to be 
enslaved, to be treated as an individual before the law, and the right not to be prosecuted on the 
basis of retroactive legislation, are fundamental human rights that shall not be curtailed under 
any circumstance&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Prohibition of torture and criminal accountability of perpetrators 
of torture under national law 
</b></p>
<p><b>Criminal Code 
</b></p>
<p>13. Indonesia&#8217;s Criminal Code (KUHP) of 1982 does not contain a definition of torture. Its 
Chapter XX only refers to &#8220;maltreatment&#8221;, with articles 351 to 358 providing for prison 
sentences up to 15 years depending on the impact on (e.g. &#8220;physical injury&#8221; and &#8220;intentional 
injury to the health&#8221;), and the sex and physical condition of the victim. However, the concept of 
maltreatment as enshrined in KUHP lacks several elements of the torture definition under 
article 1 CAT, such as the elements of purpose, mental pain or suffering, and agency (i.e 
inflicted or instigated by a public official or with his or her consent or acquiescence). Torture 
must also be punished with adequate sanctions if it does not lead to any physical injuries. The 
decisive criterion for torture as a crime is not whether any injuries were sustained but the 
intention of infliction of severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, on a powerless 
person (above all a detainee) for a specific purpose, such as extraction of information or a 
confession. Similarly, article 442 of the Criminal Code, stating that &#8220;any official who in a 
criminal case makes use of means of coercion either to extract a confession or to provoke a 
statement, shall be punished by a maximum imprisonment of four years&#8221; is not in compliance 
with requirements under CAT. Although a revision of KUHP was initiated more than a decade 
ago, and several drafts - some incorporating a definition of torture - have been circulating, no 
amendments have been adopted to this date. 
</p>
<p><b>Laws on Human Rights 39/1999 and Human Rights Courts 26/2000 
</b></p>
<p>14. Law 39/1999 on Human Rights refers to the prohibition of torture in its articles 1, 4, 33, 34 
and 66. Article 1 (4) defines torture as &#8221;any activity which is undertaken intentionally so as to 
cause someone severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, in order to obtain a 
confession or information from that person or a third person, punishing him for an act he or a 
third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him 
or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or 
suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public 
official or other person acting in an official capacity&#8221;. Article 4 refers to the right not to be 
tortured as a non-derogable right, and article 66 (1) specifically refers to the right of every child 
not to be subject to torture. Article 9 of Law 26/2000 on Human Rights Courts states that torture 
is a &#8220;crime against humanity, if perpetrated as a part of a broad or systematic direct attack on 
civilians&#8221;.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/3/Add.7 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>15. While in principle welcoming the fact that these laws refer to torture, the Special 
Rapporteur observes that the Law on Human Rights 39/1999 does not provide any effective 
mechanisms for dealing with individual complaints. This is due to the fact that the application of 
Law 26/2000 on Human Rights Courts is restricted to cases involving &#8220;gross violations of human 
rights&#8221;, which were consistently interpreted as &#8220;crimes against humanity&#8221;<b>3</b> requiring &#8220;a broad 
and systematic attack against civilians &#8230; in form of torture &#8230;&#8221;<b>4</b>. Due to this interpretation of the 
term &#8220;gross&#8221;, which in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s opinion does not reflect the prevailing opinion 
under international law, individual cases cannot be tried by Human Rights Courts. 
</p>
<p>16. Legal provisions relating to complaints, investigations of torture allegations and safeguards 
are discussed in section III below. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Sharia provisions in Aceh&#8217;s Criminal Code 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about penalties provided for by Sharia law, such as 
public flogging, incorporated into the 2005 Aceh Criminal Code following the special autonomy 
status agreed in the Helsinki Memorandum of Understanding. These local regulations 
criminalize the consumption of alcohol, closed proximity between unwed couples, and gambling, 
and penalize them by flogging. Corporal punishment constitutes degrading and inhuman 
treatment in violation of article 7 ICCPR and article 16 CAT and should therefore be abolished. 
These morality offences under Sharia law are normally tried in public hearings, at which the 
audience can shout at the defendant, which renders the presumption of innocence meaningless. 
Moreover, punishments are carried out in public and are often televised.  
</p>
<p><b>II.  TORTURE AND ILL-TREATMENT  
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Torture and ill-treatment in places of detention  
</b></p>
<p><b>Penitentiary institutions 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur has received a limited number of allegations of ill-treatment in 
both pretrial detention houses and prisons, notably allegations corroborated by forensic medical 
evidence as well as confirmed by open acknowledgements of prison officials that corporal 
punishment is executed in a number of facilities. It is worth noting that in Pasir Putih maximum 
security prison there was not one allegation of abuse.  
</p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur found allegations and evidence of several cases of beatings by 
guards, often in relation to attempts to escape and violations of prison rules. In several prisons, 
such as Makassar, Pondok Bambu (Jakarta), the beatings appeared to take place publicly, in front 
of other detainees. Furthermore, allegations of beatings were voiced in the prisons of Wamena 
and Abepura (both Papua) as well as Cipinang (Jakarta) and Yogyakarta. The Special Rapporteur 
is particularly concerned that he found evidence of regular corporal punishment of minors in 
</p>

</p>
<p>Kutoarjo juvenile prison, which was even admitted by the prison authorities. Whereas in 
Abepura, according to the prison director, one prison guard had been subjected to disciplinary 
sanctions in the recent past, in none of the cases a perpetrator was shown to have been brought to 
criminal justice.   
<b>Police custody 
</b></p>
<p>20. Contrasting with the situation in prisons, the Special Rapporteur received a considerable 
number of allegations of torture and ill-treatment perpetrated by the police, either during arrest or 
in custody. Reflecting the general heterogeneity of the country, abuses by the police appear to be 
more common in the densely populated cities, which are also plagued by urban crime and 
drug-related offences, rather than in the remote and rural areas. In light of the information 
received in private interviews with individuals who were or/and had been in police custody, the 
corroborating results of independent forensic medical examinations of injuries, he concludes that 
torture is routine practice in Jakarta and other metropolitan areas of Java, including Yogyakarta. 
The Special Rapporteur sees this assessment furthermore underpinned by the palpable level of 
fear among detainees, which, in those places resulted in reluctance to talk to him. At some police 
stations, e.g. in Poltabes Yogyakarta, Polres Wamena and Polres Jakarta East, severe beatings 
were ongoing as the Special Rapporteur conducted his visit.   
</p>
<p>21. The types of abuse reported to the Special Rapporteur and corroborated by forensic 
medical analysis include beatings with fists, rattan or wooden sticks, chains, cables, iron bars and 
hammers, kicking with heavy boots, electrocution and shots into the legs.  Some detainees 
alleged that heavy implements (chairs, desks, and car jacks) had been placed on their legs for a 
prolonged period of time. The injuries sustained in a vast number of cases remain without any 
treatment, putting the health of the detainee further at risk. 
</p>
<p>22. The overwhelming majority of the detainees interviewed indicated that the ill-treatment 
was used primarily to extract confessions or, in the cases of drug-related crimes, to receive 
information on drug suppliers. In a number of cases detainees were offered to be spared in return 
for the payment of a substantial amount of money. Those interlocutors who had been already 
tried reported in unison that their coerced confessions had been used during the court 
proceedings and that objections they had raised were not considered by the judge, prosecutor or 
even their own legal aid clerk. Furthermore, they were not aware of any complaints mechanism 
to which they could address their grievances expecting any kind of outcome.  
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern the very long duration of police custody. While 
the Criminal Procedure Code authorizes a maximum length of 61 days only in very specific 
circumstances, the imposition of such a long period is applied as a standard procedure. 
Consequently, detainees remain under exclusive police authority for a period exceeding many 
times the maximum period permitted under international law, making abuses more likely, and 
furthermore renders the detection of torture significantly more difficult since visible traces are 
likely to have disappeared once the detainee is released or transferred. 
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the ongoing transfers of prisoners from 
overcrowded facilities to Pasir Putih prison are conducted by the police. Prisoners reported that 
they had been handcuffed to each other, bound to the floor of planes and blindfolded for a long </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/3/Add.7 
  page 13 
 
</p>
<p>period. The Special Rapporteur would like to recall that any excessive violence, if applied in a 
situation of powerlessness, amounts to torture. Furthermore, these transfers had been conducted 
without any prior notice of the detainees, including persons condemned to death who were made 
to believe that execution might be imminent. 
</p>
<p><b>Military detention facilities 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur also visited military detention facilities in which he received 
allegations that newly arrived persons are routinely forced to do exercises such as somersaults in 
the courtyard of the institution while all other detainees watch. All newly arrived persons have 
their heads shaved and have to spend a week in a single, empty, dark cell to which the doors are 
always closed. Such practices must be considered as degrading treatment. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Conditions of detention 
</b></p>
<p><b>Penitentiary institutions 
</b></p>
<p>26. Among those penitentiary institutions visited by the Special Rapporteur, the conditions of 
detention varied considerably throughout the country, again reflecting the regional differences in 
Indonesia. While facilities in the urban areas were confronted with prison populations exceeding 
threefold their capacity, i.e. in Cipinang and Pondok Bambu, other prisons outside of Java 
provided acceptable levels of space for each prisoner. 
</p>
<p>27. In those places where there is overcrowding, this clearly has repercussions in terms of 
hygiene and security. It is of concern that for example in Cipinang prison poor newly arrived 
persons have to camp in huge halls for several months before being transferred to a proper cell, 
which may constitute inhuman treatment. Cipinang prison is also a showcase for discrimination 
in the prison system, resulting from omnipresent corruption with relatively clean and 
comfortable cells for those who can pay, whereas poor detainees have to sleep in heavily 
overcrowded halls or cells, on mats they brought from home, on the ground. Although sanitary 
facilities are available, the detainees in these halls have to queue, sometimes for prolonged 
periods, to be able to take a shower. The Special Rapporteur has received several allegations 
about inter-prisoner violence in these situations of overcrowding. 
</p>
<p>28. In Cipinang prison, conditions in overcrowded punishment cells amounted to inhuman 
treatment (see appendix). The Special Rapporteur found that detention facilities and prisons have 
&#8220;orientation programmes&#8221; in which newly arrived inmates are placed in conditions of 
&#8220;quarantine&#8221; - often for several days in small, dark and dirty cells, as observed in Wamena 
prison - that are clearly incompatible with international standards. 
</p>
<p>29. Whereas in all prisons nurses and occasionally doctors provide day-to-day medical 
treatment, serious cases generally remain untreated or receive attention at a very late stage if the 
detainee cannot provide the necessary funds. As a consequence, seriously ill persons are not 
hospitalized and receive inadequate medication, in violation of international standards. In 
Makassar prison, the Special Rapporteur came across several mentally ill prisoners who were 
kept separated from the general prison population and held in the punishment cells, in spite of </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.7 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>their evident need for proper psychiatric treatment. It was reported to the Special Rapporteur that 
HIV/AIDS is a major problem. Another serious concern relates to high death tolls in places of 
detention, i.e. Cipinang (see appendix), which are difficult to explain even when bearing in mind 
the high HIV/AIDS rate. 
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur received numerous complaints about the quality and quantity of 
food. Generally, basic food consisting of rice, sometimes supplemented by eggs and rarely by 
some fish, is provided twice a day. Other supplies depend on the family or on work taken over 
for richer co-prisoners. 
</p>
<p>31. In violation of international standards, pretrial detainees and convicted prisoners are not 
separated in several of the prisons visited by the Special Rapporteur, such as the Pondok Bambu 
Prison (Jakarta) and the Juvenile Detention Centre Kutoarjo (Central Java). 
32. Another issue of concern is the hierarchy among prisoners - some being employed to guard 
the others (<i>Palkams</i>), with privileges attached to such roles where all sorts of services can be 
traded, including of a sexual nature. In this regard the Special Rapporteur would like to recall 
that inter-prisoner violence can amount to torture or ill-treatment if the State fails to act with due 
diligence to prevent it. 
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur would like to note some good practices as well. Article 4 of 
Law 12/1995 on Corrections requires staff to respect the human rights of inmates. The 
penitentiary system is based on the idea of reintegration,<b>5</b> which was reflected in the relative 
openness of detention places (i.e. in most places prisoners spent much of the daytime outside of 
their cells and could receive visits of relatives and friends several times a week); keeping contact 
with the outside world is a major component of successful rehabilitation and reintegration of 
detainees and also an important potential safeguard against ill-treatment. This openness was 
particularly apparent in prisons in Papua, including for those charged with political offences. 
However, the prisons on the island of Nusa Kambangan, due to their isolated location, arguably 
hindered reintegration, since visits are extremely complicated and costly. Many of the prisons 
were very spacious, clean and well maintained, and occupied below maximum capacity. The 
Special Rapporteur also commends the system for treating young adults (persons between 18 
and 21) as a distinct category and holding them separately from adults when possible. 
</p>
<p><b>Police custody 
</b></p>
<p>34. The regional discrepancies are also reflected in the conditions of detention in police 
custody. Although the infrastructure of the cells in police stations was generally in line with 
international standards, the facilities were not adapted for the prolonged periods of up to several 
months that people usually spend in police custody. Some cells were overcrowded and some 
facilities lacked fresh air, natural light and adequate sanitary facilities. Detention for up 
to 61 days in these conditions amounts to degrading and inhuman treatment. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  See for example Law 12/1995 on Corrections, which states that reintegration is an essential 
</p>
<p>aim of the penitentiary system. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/3/Add.7 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur received several complaints about the quantity and quality of food. 
In many cases, detainees indicated that they received only one portion of very basic food for up 
to four persons. He was informed that some detainees, once they were transferred to the authority 
of the prosecutor, stopped receiving food altogether, even though they remained in police 
custody. The officer in charge at Polres Abepura admitted that if the prosecutor did not provide 
the funds for buying food for the detainees, they were not provided any. 
</p>
<p>36. Lack of access to medical care was another major concern, in some cases exacerbated by 
the fact that detainees had sustained injuries during arrest and during interrogation and were in 
urgent need of medical attention. 
</p>
<p><b>Corruption and lack of resources 
</b></p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur received numerous and consistent allegations that corruption is 
deeply ingrained in the criminal justice system. Several sources indicated that at every stage, 
starting from the police and the judiciary to the detention centres and prisons, corruption is a 
quasi-institutionalized practice. This is of particular concern in detention situations, where it can 
lead to significant discrimination in terms of conditions, notably access to food, sanitary 
facilities, health care and the possibility to receive visitors. At the same time, corruption also has 
an impact on how a prisoner is treated; some detainees alleged that they have to pay in order not 
to be subjected to beatings upon arrival in prison and during police interrogation. 
38. The Special Rapporteur recognizes that insufficient conditions in detention facilities, such 
as the lack of adequate food and access to health care, are aggravated by the lack of resources 
faced by some institutions/authorities. Well aware of the complexity of the reasons for 
corruption, the Special Rapporteur notes that the eradication of corruption which might result in 
discriminative practices and ill-treatment is dependent on adequate salaries and working 
conditions for police officers and prison guards.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Excessive violence during police and military operations 
</b></p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur has received consistent allegations about the use of excessive force 
by security forces.<b>7</b> It is reported that in particular in Papua, mobile paramilitary police units 
(Brigade Mobil or Brimob) have routinely been engaging in largely indiscriminate village 
&#8220;sweeping&#8221; operations in search of alleged independence activists and their supporters, or raids 
on university boarding houses, using excessive force. Recently, allegations have been made 
about incidents in border areas, where the military is strengthening its presence. The Special 
Rapporteur considers that these consistent allegations from a number of credible sources, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  Indonesia is ranked 143rd on the Corruption Perception Index 2007 issued by Transparency 
</p>
<p>International. This index ranks 180 countries by their perceived levels of corruption, as 
determined by expert assessments and opinion surveys.

</b>  See e.g. <i>Human Rights Watch: Out of Sight. Endemic Abuse and Impunity in Papua&#8217;s Central 
</i></p>
<p><i>Highlands</i>. Vol. 19, No. 10 c. July 2007; also <i>International Crisis Group: Jihaddism in 
Indonesia: Poso on the Edge</i>, Asia Report No. 127, 24 January 2007. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.7 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>combined with the quasi-total impunity, are of serious concern. He notes that the heavy 
restrictions placed on travel within Papua restricts effective information flow, which is 
fundamental to the protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Minors 
</b></p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur is extremely concerned that criminal responsibility in Indonesia 
starts at the age of 8 and that therefore small children are put in detention facilities and prisons, 
very often mixed with much older children and adults. In more general terms, the fact that 
children and adults often mix in places of detention is a violation of international standards. 
</p>
<p>41. Whereas he welcomes Law 3/1997 on Juvenile Courts and also notes that some progress 
has been made in sentencing fewer minors to prison terms, he would like to recall the findings of 
the Committee on the Rights of the Child, which expressed concern &#8220;at the very large number of 
children sentenced to jail even for petty crimes&#8221;.<b>8</b> 
42. Corporal punishment of children is unlawful under article 66 of the Law on Human 
Rights 26/2000 which states: &#8220;Every child has the right not to be subjected to acts of oppression, 
torture, or inhuman legal punishment ...&#8221; In addition, articles 13 and 16 of Law 23/2002 on 
Protection of Children contain some relevant provisions outlawing violence, abuse, inhuman 
punishment under law, torture and other forms of ill-treatment against children. However, in the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s assessment, minors and children are at high risk of corporal punishment 
and ill-treatment not only in their families and schools,<b>9</b> but also when they are in detention. At 
the juvenile detention centres in Pondok Bambu prison (Jakarta), and in Yogyakarta prison, 
many of the minors alleged that they had been beaten either by policemen or by co-detainees 
during police custody, often with the knowledge of the officers. At Kutoarjo juvenile prison, 
detainees consistently reported regular beatings, often in public, to intimidate the other juveniles. 
The prison authorities openly admitted the regular use of corporal punishment for disciplinary 
purposes. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Women 
</b></p>
<p>43. Whereas the Special Rapporteur welcomes that there are certain laws aimed at preventing 
and outlawing torture and violence against women,<b>10</b> he is concerned at some shortcomings in 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>

</b>  CRC/C/15/Add.223, para. 76. 
</p>
<p><b>9
</b>  See also the concluding observations of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, which held 
</p>
<p>that &#8220;The Committee is deeply concerned that corporal punishment in the family and in schools 
is widespread, culturally accepted and still lawful.&#8221; (Ibid, para. 43). 
<b>10
</b></p>
<p>  For example Law 23/2004 defines and outlaws different forms of domestic violence and 
provides penalties of up to 15 years imprisonment and a maximum fine of 9 million rupiah for 
perpetrators of such crimes. See also Law 12/1996 concerning the Imprisonment of Women and 
Children. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/3/Add.7

</p>
<p>their implementation. Some detention facilities do not have enough female staff, as required by 
international standards. However, he commends that pregnant women are often temporarily 
released from custody to be able to deliver their baby, and that women in police custody as well 
as in prisons can live together with their babies and are allowed to maintain very close contact 
with their elder children.<b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>44. Regarding domestic violence, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the adoption of the 2004 
law banning violence in the household and establishing complaints channels. However, he was 
informed that many obstacles still hamper the implementation of this law, such as the lack of 
awareness among law enforcement agencies and the public of the need to address domestic 
violence, and the insufficient number of appropriate police units to deal with such complaints. 
</p>
<p>45. Confirming earlier received allegations, the Special Rapporteur came across a situation in 
which police were actually mediating a rape case by supporting the payment of a fine as a 
settlement of the case. Although the Special Rapporteur appreciates the traditional methods of 
justice by means of mediation and conflict settlement, he wishes to underline that such 
punishments are not commensurate with the gravity of the crime and are not in accordance with 
the State&#8217;s obligation to protect women from private sexual violence. He also notes with concern 
reports that in some incidences rape cases are resolved by forcing the rapist to marry the 
victim.<b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that women are disproportionally affected by 
corporal punishment provided for by the Aceh Criminal Code, which is based on Sharia law. 
Besides public flogging, punishments include cutting the women&#8217;s dresses in public and forced 
shaving of their heads, which constitute inhuman and degrading treatment. Moreover, the fact 
that these punishments are carried out in public generates stigmatization and social sanctioning 
lasting beyond the execution of the punishment, as women sentenced to such public punishments 
are labelled as immoral by their husbands, families and communities. This social exclusion can 
equally amount to inhuman and degrading treatment. 
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur visited Pasar Rebo Social Rehabilitation Centre (Dan Pelayanan 
Sosial) in Jakarta. He did not receive any serious complaints regarding the conditions or 
allegations of violence and commends that the detained women receive vocational training. 
However, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that since the women are held outside the criminal 
legal framework, there are no legal safeguards in place; there is no independent assessment of 
who should be detained and no right to habeas corpus for the detainees. According to the 
information received, facilities such as Pasar Rebo exist only for women, which raises concerns 
that this may constitute discrimination against women.

</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur was impressed by the work done by the National Commission on 
Violence against Women.<b>13</b> He considers exemplary their efforts in trying to gather data, 
thoroughly assessing a given situation and using this analysis to shape policies, even if further 
work needs to be done to address underreporting and geographic imbalances in reporting. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>49. Given the lack of legal safeguards and doubts in a number of instances as to how 
confessions might have been obtained, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the death 
penalty not be applied. He also regrets the secrecy with which executions are handled and the 
lack of information of the condemned prisoners and the public. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  IMPUNITY AND LACK OF PREVENTION 
</b></p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur observes that while due to the vastness of Indonesia and the time 
constraints during his visit he was unable to extend his fact-finding to all parts of the country, 
there are two overarching issues that he found to apply everywhere, which are critical to 
effectively combating torture and which need urgent attention by the authorities. The first 
concerns the lack of adequate mechanisms to investigate allegations of torture and the quasi-total 
impunity of security personnel, especially of the police and military, for current as well as past 
violations. Secondly, no effective prevention framework has been put in place to ensure that 
every person&#8217;s right to his/her physical and mental integrity is respected, leaving the detainees at 
the mercy of prison and police authorities. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Impunity 
</b></p>
<p><b>Investigation of acts of torture 
</b></p>
<p>51. The police&#8217;s Criminal Investigation Department is in charge of investigating crimes, 
including those committed by police officers, but since the Criminal Code does not contain a 
definition of torture, its effectiveness is limited. 
</p>
<p>52. Also, the police unit Probam<b>14</b> is responsible for investigations with regard to violations of 
internal police regulations and offences by police officers. Although this is a general mechanism 
which is not specifically aimed at addressing torture cases, individuals can file complaints with 
regard to torture with Probam, which exists in most police offices. According to anecdotal 
evidence, disciplinary sanctions imposed by Probam in most cases amount to temporary 
dismissal, postponements of promotion or other disciplinary measures which by no means reflect 
the gravity of the crime of torture. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>13
</b>  The National Commission on Violence against Women (Komnas Perempuan) was established 
</p>
<p>in 1998 with a mandate to monitor and document all forms of violence against women.

</p>
<p>53. The newly established National Police Commission (KOMPOLNAS) is composed of 
members of the Government, police and some civil society representatives. The Commission 
receives complaints from the public concerning police performance, but does not report publicly 
on these activities. 
</p>
<p>54. All of these bodies do not operate transparently, and the Special Rapporteur has not found 
any evidence to suggest that they function as effective anti-torture mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b>Prosecution of alleged perpetrators of torture 
</b></p>
<p>55. There are several avenues for the prosecution of perpetrators of human rights violations. 
The first is the court of general jurisdiction that applies the Penal Code (KUHP), which is 
hampered by the lack of a definition of torture, as discussed above. In this regard, the 
Special Rapporteur is concerned that article 51 of the Penal Code permits invoking official 
orders as a justification for acts, which may constitute a violation of article 2 (3) of the 
Convention against Torture. 
</p>
<p>56. The second avenue is the human rights court created under Law 26/2000 to prosecute cases 
of genocide and crimes against humanity based on Human Rights Law 39/1999. According to 
these laws, the National Human Rights Commission has the authority to receive complaints and 
conduct preliminary inquiries into allegations of gross human rights violations and to hand them 
over to the Attorney-General&#8217;s office for further action. However, the Special Rapporteur notes 
that in most of the cases transmitted the Attorney-General decided not to prosecute the case.<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>57. According to article 104 of the Law on Human Rights Courts, ad hoc courts can be 
established for gross human rights violations that occurred before the adoption of the law 
on 23 November 2000. Such courts were established in six cases so far, but only three of these 
cases were concluded (on East Timor, Tanjung Priok and Abepura) and not a single State official 
has been found guilty. For example, in the Abepura case  the National Human Rights 
Commission named 25 suspects; the Attorney General&#8217;s office charged two of them and the 
courts acquitted them despite of evidence that unlawful violence had been committed, justifying 
its decision by reference to Standard Operating Procedures.<b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>58. Cases against members of the military fall under the jurisdiction of military courts, which 
apply the KUHP and the Military Penal Code. Nobody has ever been convicted for torture by a 
military court. However, since 2006, efforts have been made, with the support of the President, 
to bring criminal cases within the remit of civilian courts even when members of the army are 
charged.

<p>59. Whereas Law 27/2004 provides the legal basis for the establishment of the Indonesian 
Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the Government has not created the commission so far, 
although its statute provides that it must be formed within six months of the enactment of the 
law. On 7 December 2006, the Constitutional Court ruled that Law No 27/2004 regarding the 
Truth and Reconciliation Commission does not have a sound legal foundation and is inconsistent 
with the Constitution,<b>17</b> which delayed the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission in Aceh,<b>18</b> which has yet to be established.

<p><b>Monitoring and inspection 
</b></p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur observes that no functioning monitoring mechanisms are in place 
in Indonesia. The ICRC has access to some detainees, NGOs can make visits in prisons, and the 
National Human Rights Commission has been conducting announced visits to police stations. 
However, there is no independent and effective mechanism which would have the power to 
conduct unannounced visits to all places of detention throughout the country. In this respect the 
Special Rapporteur commends the National Human Rights Action Plan (2004-2009), which 
foresees the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture in 2008. This 
instrument requires the establishment of a National Preventive Mechanism (NPM) vested with 
the mandate to conduct independent monitoring based on unannounced visits to all places where 
persons are deprived of their liberty. He considers that accession to this important instrument and 
its effective implementation would constitute a major step towards preventing torture and 
ill-treatment in the future. 
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur notes that the National Human Rights Commission signed a 
Memorandum of Understanding with the police granting it free access to all police detention 
facilities. However, its visits so far were in reaction to complaints, and the Commission has not 
conducted any unannounced visits to places of detention and/or private interviews with 
detainees.<b>23</b> The National Commission on Violence against Women monitors the situation of 
violence against women in the country, but undertakes visits to places of detention only on an 
ad hoc basis. 
</p>
<p>62. Statistical data are a crucial tool for monitoring the criminal justice system and vital for 
identifying trends and developments and devising corresponding policies. The Special 
Rapporteur has received only some official statistics which makes it more difficult to make an 
assessment of the situation of torture in the criminal justice context. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government for the positive steps taken since the 
end of the Suharto era, notably its accession to international human rights instruments, a number 
of legislative reforms and good practices that he observed, in particular in the penitentiary 
system, putting emphasis on reintegration and favouring contacts with families and the 
community. However, several issues of concern remain. 
</p>
<p>64. Whereas in some police stations he did not receive any allegations of ill-treatment, in other 
facilities, in particular in urban areas, torture and ill-treatment is used routinely to extract 
confessions or in the context of drug charges to reveal dealers/suppliers. In three police stations, 
the Special Rapporteur arrived while beatings were taking place, and in several places he found 
persistent medical evidence of several types of ill-treatment, which are in line with reports by 
</p>

</p>
<p>prisoners and various other credible sources received prior and during his visit. In prisons, only a 
very limited number of torture cases were reported; however, corporal punishment is regularly 
practiced in a number of detention facilities. 
</p>
<p>65. Several elements, such as the lack of a definition and prohibition of torture in accordance 
with the Convention against Torture, the lack of legal safeguards with regard to detention, the 
lack of criminal prosecution and the absence of an independent monitoring mechanism create an 
environment which is conducive to torture and ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>66. The existence of torture is also facilitated by the lack of awareness and (appropriate) action 
of other stakeholders in the criminal law system, such as members of the medical profession, 
judges and lawyers. Furthermore, traces of ill-treatment during police interrogation can be easily 
hidden due to the excessive length of 61 days of police custody. 
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that conditions in prisons in most cases live up to 
international standards. However, the conditions in heavily overcrowded cells and detention halls 
in prisons visited on Java amount to inhuman and degrading treatment. The quantity and quality 
of food, as well as the restricted or late access to medical services, in particular for serious cases, 
is a concern in practically all places he visited. 
</p>
<p>68. Conditions in police custody in most cases meet international standards for short-term 
detention of not more than a few days. The cells in police lock-ups are, however, not equipped 
for long-term detention. The fact that under Indonesian law and practice persons can be detained 
for several weeks up to 61 days in premises which are meant to hold detainees for only a few 
days also amounts to inhuman and degrading treatment. 
</p>
<p>69. At all stages of the criminal justice cycle corruption is involved, all too often accompanied 
by discriminatory practices. Corruption in prisons, practised by officials and prisoners, 
frequently with the consent of the prison authorities, leads to unequal access to essential goods 
and constitutes a violation of international norms. 
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur is very concerned that minors and children are at greater risk of 
corporal punishment and ill-treatment than adults in situations where they are deprived of their 
liberty. He is also concerned about the absence of a specialized juvenile justice system. 
71. The Special Rapporteur has found that impunity with regard to perpetrators of torture and 
ill-treatment in past conflicts is almost total.<b>24</b> This situation applies both to the present situation 
and the systematic practice of torture under the Suharto regime in the past. In particular, lack of 
accountability is of concern with regard to all acts of political violence committed over the years, 
starting from 1965, including in relation to conflicts such as in East Timor, Aceh and others, 
where torture and acts of violence were widely used. Bringing perpetrators of torture and 
ill-treatment to justice for the serious crimes they have committed is the strongest signal that 
torture and ill-treatment is absolutely unacceptable.

</p>
<p><b>B.  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>In the spirit of cooperation and partnership, the Special Rapporteur recommends 
that the Government, with the assistance of the international community (i.e. the 
United Nations and other actors), take decisive steps to implement the following 
recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b>Impunity 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>Torture should be defined and criminalized as a matter of priority and as a concrete 
demonstration of Indonesia&#8217;s commitment to combat the problem, in accordance with 
articles 1 and 4 of the Convention against Torture, with penalties commensurate with the 
gravity of torture. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The declaration should be made with respect to article 22 of the Convention 
recognizing the competence of the Committee against Torture to receive and consider 
communications from individuals who claim to be victims of a violation of the provisions of 
the Convention. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The Government should ensure that corporal punishment, independently of the 
physical suffering it causes, is explicitly criminalized in all parts of the country. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>Officials at the highest level should condemn torture and announce a zero-tolerance 
policy vis-&#224;-vis any ill-treatment by State officials. The Government should adopt an 
anti-torture action plan which foresees awareness-raising programmes and training for all 
stakeholders, including the National Human Rights Commission and civil society 
representatives, in order to lead them to live up to their human rights obligations and fulfil 
their specific task in the fight against torture. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>All allegations of torture and ill-treatment should be promptly and thoroughly 
investigated ex-officio by an independent authority with no connection to the authority 
investigating or prosecuting the case against the alleged victim. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Safeguards and prevention25 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>As a matter of urgent priority, the period of police custody should be reduced to a 
time limit in line with international standards (maximum of 48 hours); after this period the 
detainees should be transferred to a pretrial facility under a different authority, where no 
further unsupervised contact with the interrogators or investigators should be permitted. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>All detainees should be effectively guaranteed the ability to challenge the lawfulness 
of the detention before an independent court, e.g. through habeas corpus proceedings. 
</b></p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>25
</b>  For more specific comments see above, the table in section III. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.7 
page 26 
 
</p>
<p>80. <b>Judges and prosecutors should routinely ask persons arriving from police custody 
how they have been treated, and if they suspect that they have been subjected to 
ill-treatment, order an independent medical examination in accordance with the Istanbul 
Protocol, even in the absence of a formal complaint from the defendant. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The maintenance of custody registers should be scrupulously ensured. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>Confessions made by persons in custody without the presence of a lawyer and which 
are not confirmed before a judge shall not be admissible as evidence against the persons 
who made the confession. Serious consideration should be given to video and audio taping 
of interrogations, including of all persons present. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>Accessible and effective complaints mechanisms should be established. These should 
be accessible from all over the country and from all places of detention; complaints by 
detainees should be followed up by independent and thorough investigations, and 
complainants must be protected against any reprisals. The agencies in charge of conducting 
investigations, inter alia Probam, should receive targeted training. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The Government of Indonesia should expediently accede to the Optional Protocol to 
the Convention against Torture, and establish a truly independent National Preventive 
Mechanism (NPM) to carry out unannounced visits to all places of detention. 
</b>85. <b>The Government of Indonesia should support the National Commission on Human 
Rights and the National Commission on Violence against Women in their endeavours to 
become effective players in the fight against torture and provide them with the necessary 
resources and training to ensure their effective functioning. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Excessive violence 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The Special Rapporteur recalls that excessive violence during military and police 
actions can amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. The Government of 
Indonesia should take all steps necessary to stop the use of excessive violence during police 
and military operations, above all in conflict areas such as Papua and Central Sulawesi. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Conditions of detention 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Government of Indonesia should continue efforts to improve detention 
conditions, in particular with a view to providing health care, treat rather than punish 
persons with mental disabilities, and improve the quantity and quality of food. The 
Government, in all detention contexts, should ensure the separation of minors from adults 
and of pretrial prisoners from convicts and train and deploy female personnel to women&#8217;s 
sections of prisons and custody facilities. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The Government of Indonesia should ensure that the criminal justice system is 
non-discriminatory at every stage, combat corruption, which disproportionately affects </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/3/Add.7 
  page 27 
 
</p>
<p><b>the poor, the vulnerable and minorities, and take effective measures against corruption by 
public officials responsible for the administration of justice, including judges, prosecutors, 
police and prison personnel. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The death penalty should be abolished. While it is still applied, the secrecy 
surrounding the death penalty and executions should stop immediately. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Children 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The age of criminal responsibility should be raised as a matter of priority. Through 
further reform of the juvenile justice system, Indonesia should take immediate measures to 
ensure that deprivation of liberty of minors is used only as a last resort and for the shortest 
possible period of time and in appropriate conditions. Children in detention should be 
strictly separated from adults. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Women 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>In consultation with the Commission on Violence against Women, the Government 
should establish effective mechanisms to enforce the prohibition of violence against women, 
including in the family and wider community, above all through further awareness-raising 
within the law-enforcement organs. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Recommendation to the international community  
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Special Rapporteur requests the international community to support the efforts 
of Indonesia in reforming its criminal law system. In particular, all measures to establish 
well-resourced and independent national preventive mechanisms in compliance with 
international standards that cover the entire territory of Indonesia should be treated as a 
priority and supported with generous financial assistance. </b></p>

<p><b>Appendix I 
</b></p>
<p><b>PLACES OF DETENTION - INDIVIDUAL CASES 
</b></p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The following accounts are based on allegations by detainees interviewed by the Special 
Rapporteur. Detainees who requested anonymity are indicated below as &#8220;Detainee&#8221; or 
&#8220;Prisoner&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur sought to conduct unannounced visits to detention facilities, 
but in some cases it appeared that the authorities expected him when he arrived. In general, he 
was able to hold private interviews with detainees. 
</p>
<p>2. The Indonesian correctional service under the Ministry of Justice manages 
around 350 detention facilities (16 juvenile prisons, 6 drug prisons) with an official capacity 
of 75,000. In December 2007 there were about 134,000 inmates, of which approximately 60,000 
were in pre-trial detention. About 35 per cent of the persons are in detention on charges related 
to drug crimes. 113 persons are charged with terrorist activities and about 100 convicts are on 
death row. The correctional service reported that in light of the problem of overcrowding they 
aim at increasing the use of conditional release. Prison directors earn up to 350 $US a month. 
The salary of a prison guard is less than 100 $US a month. 
</p>
<p><b>SOCIAL REHABILITATION CENTRE PASAR REBO (JAKARTA) 
</b>(Visited on 11 November 2007)<b> 
</b></p>
<p>3. The Social Rehabilitation consists of a large compound with small houses 
where 110 women between the age of 18 and 46, most of them accused of being former sex 
workers, are detained. Up to 15 women are detained together in a small house with up to five 
rooms. The houses are clean, and equipped with a TV and bunk beds; access to water is granted 
without restrictions. There are 48 staff members; more than 50 per cent of them are women. The 
Special Rapporteur was received by a representative of the facility&#8217;s management.  
</p>
<p>4. The women can be held for up to six months - depending on their medical condition and 
behaviour - without any right of habeas corpus, for the purpose of rehabilitation, i.e. forced 
re-education in accordance with religious values under the authority of the Ministry for Social 
Affairs. About 10 per cent of the women have been at the centre before. All of them were 
arrested in the street by the &#8220;Satpol PP&#8221;, held for two hours in their premises to register their 
data, and then transferred to the Centre. Upon arrival their case file is assessed by a social worker 
team on the basis of a set of criteria including a blood test/vagina test, the place of origin, and 
sexually transmitted diseases. Women who have HIV/AIDS are referred to a different place. 
They receive vocational training in sewing, cooking, embroidery and cosmetics.  
</p>
<p>5. The women are not allowed to leave the compound. During the night they are locked in 
their rooms. They may leave the rooms between 6 am and 7.30 pm (at the latest depending on 
prayer times). Smoking is prohibited and may be punished by postponing release. They must 
pray five times a day.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/3/Add.7 
  page 29 
 
</p>
<p>6. Family visits are allowed twice a week for 90 minutes. Women are separated from their 
children and allowed to see them only during visiting hours. If nobody else can take care of the 
children, they are taken to a shelter. To give birth women can go to a special facility. 
</p>
<p>7. Violation of the rules of the centre is punished with an increase in working hours 
(housework, gardening, cooking). If after this punishment a woman continues to violate the 
rules, &#8220;the other persons of her house will talk to her&#8221; (&#8220;peer therapy&#8221;) and may decide to isolate 
her. There is no official complaints mechanism, but the detainees can complain to the instructors 
about the guards. The Special Rapporteur was informed about one case of attempted escape, 
where the woman was caught, taken to an office, slapped and had her hair cut. 
</p>
<p>8. According to the information received, facilities as Pasar Rebo exist only for women, what 
raises concerns about their potential instrumentalization as a means for discriminating women. 
The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the women detained at the Social Rehabilitation Centre 
do not have access to judicial review of their detention, which constitutes a violation of their 
right to habeas corpus. 
</p>
<p>9. <b>Female detainee</b>, aged 40, from Sumatra. She had been at the centre for about three and a 
half months. She was arrested on the street at 2 am together with others by the Satpol who 
arrived in civilian cars and pulled her and the others into the car. She thinks that the conditions in 
the centre are acceptable and reports that access to medical care is granted. Whereas social 
workers do not use violence, some of them shout at them if they misbehave.  
</p>
<p>10. <b>Female detainee</b>, aged 30, from Tangerang, mother of two children of 3 and 6 years. She 
had delivered a baby on 29 June 2007 and was arrested on 2 July 2007, when she was on the way 
to a clinic with her child. The police saw her, recognized her as a &#8220;former&#8221; and immediately 
proceeded to arrest her and took her to Satpol premises, where she met her parents who did not 
want her to go to the rehabilitation centre. It is the seventh time that she is at the centre. Her baby 
died in mid-October. In general the guards treat them well if they stick to the rules. If they 
violate the rules, the guards adopt a rougher style of conversation and shout. The women are 
sometimes forced to stand in the sun for up to 30 minutes or do cleaning or kitchen work. Upon 
arrival the guards sometimes &#8220;test&#8221; the women. They knock on the door and offer money to her. 
If she accepts she has shown that she is a &#8220;bad girl&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>11. <b>Female detainee</b>, aged 26, from Depo, detained in Malahayati Block, had been in the 
shelter for two months and expected to be released after a total of six months. The actual release 
date depends on the evaluation results of the &#8220;case conference&#8221; involving the director of the 
shelter, her supervisor as well as members of her family. She was arrested on suspicion of 
working as a prostitute in a caf&#233; during a police inspection, because she had been unable to 
present an ID. After the arrest she was immediately transferred to the shelter. Not long before her 
arrest, she had divorced from her husband and suffered psychological problems as a result of 
which she vandalized her family&#8217;s flat and sold their furniture without informing them. 
Subsequently, her family supported the transfer to the shelter since they considered their 
daughter had become &#8220;crazy&#8221;.  </p>

<p><b>PONDOK BAMBU PRE-TRIAL PRISON (JAKARTA) 
</b>(Visited on 13 November 2007)<b> 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur was received by the prison director, Mr. Suharman. The prison 
has a capacity of 504 and on the day of the visit the total number of detainees was 1,582, of 
which 886 women (out of whom 44 under 18; 65 between 18 and 21; and 464 older than 21), 
696 men (60 of them convicted), 387 boys between 14 and 18, and 159 young adults (18 to 21). 
The heavy overcrowding of the cells results in problematic hygienic conditions. A large 
percentage of the detainees are charged with drug-related crimes. The majority are in pre-trial 
detention or convicts who wait for the result of their appeal. Convicted prisoners are occupied 
with cleaning and kitchen work and other tasks. In the courtyard all the inmates can intermingle. 
There are 260 staff members (155 men, 105 women). 
</p>
<p>13. The institution consists of five blocks (A, B, C, D, E); A and E are used for female 
detainees and B for boys. There is a quarantine with four cells (each about 4 by 5 metres), one 
for newcomers, one for punishment, two for sick inmates. According to information received 
detainees are held there for a maximum of 14 days; however it appears that some stay there for 
longer. Detainees have to pay 20 000 IDR (about 2 $US ) to receive a visitor. Several detainees 
indicated that they had been offered to be freed against payment.  
</p>
<p>14. The facility has a well-equipped clinic run by three general practitioners, one dentist and 
seven nurses. Basic medicine was available. It was reported that in 2007, one person died from a 
heart attack, one from tuberculosis and two from HIV/AIDS. Autopsies are performed at the 
central hospital; but only upon the family&#8217;s request. According to the prison management, each 
newly arrived person undergoes a medical examination. However this information was not 
confirmed by any of the prisoners. As soon as a person has injuries resulting from torture 
requiring medical treatment, the prison authorities return the person back to the police and (in 
some cases) ask them to take charge of the medical treatment. Such cases are not submitted to 
the Police Commission or any other body in charge of investigating possible cases of torture.  
</p>
<p>15. On the day of the visit there were 14 boys in the newcomers&#8217; cell; the youngest 
was 14 years old. They were not informed of how long they would have to stay in this cell. The 
officers shaved their heads upon arrival. The boys complained about lack of food. 12 out of the 
14 boys reported having been beaten or burned with cigarettes at the police (8 of them by 
co-detainees) where they were detained between one and two months. There are no vocational 
activities and detainees are only occasionally allowed to leave their cells. Violation of prison 
rules are punished with detention in the quarantine for one or two weeks. If a person continues to 
misbehave after 14 days, he is put into a new block instead of returning to the previous one. 
Seven of the detainees alleged that they were beaten with wood and rattan sticks and sometimes 
with cables for punishment purposes in the prison. The beatings normally took place in front of 
the cell. Access to water was restricted.  
</p>
<p>16. <b>Detainee</b>, aged 18, has cigarette burns on his feet that reportedly were inflicted by other 
inmates at Polsek 715, Tanah Abang, Jkt Pusat., because he was not able to pay the &#8220;room rent&#8221; 
at the police. He was detained for 28 days at the Polsek. He did not file a complaint.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/3/Add.7 
  page 31 
 
</p>
<p>17. <b>Detainee</b>, aged 20, accused of theft, was arrested in September 2007 and repeatedly beaten 
by the police with a rattan stick during the first week at the interrogation room on the upper floor 
of Polsek Bayankara Semper, Jkt Utara. He did not have bruises any more.  
</p>
<p>18. <b>Detainee</b>, aged 16, from Palembong, South Sumatra, was arrested by the police in East 
Jakarta on 5 May 2007. During the arrest he was kicked and beaten with bamboo sticks in order 
to make him confess. From 5 May to 29 June 2007 he was kept in police custody at Polsek 
Ciracas, East Jakarta, and then transferred to Pandok Bambu prison. He was convicted on the 
basis of a confession he made under torture.  
</p>
<p>19. <b>Detainee, </b>aged 24, from Pandang, Sumatra, has been detained in Pondok Bambu for two 
months. Prior to that, he was held in police custody at Polres Jakarta South. Detainees at the 
Polres have to pay 20,000 IDR (about 2 $US) per visit. 
</p>
<p>20. <b>Detainee</b>, aged 13, from North Jakarta, was arrested by the police on charges of sexual 
harassment of a 15-year-old girl. He was detained at the Kelapa Gading police station, then taken 
to 702 Polres Tanjung PRKK and finally transferred to Pondok Bambu Prison. He was beaten 
with an iron bar and whipped by prison guards upon arrival. The beatings took place in the post 
at the backside of block C. 
</p>
<p>21. <b>Female detainee,</b> aged 30, from Java West, in Pondok Bambu Prison for one year after 
having been held in police custody in Jakarta for three months. She had been detained in the 
isolation and punishment cell since Saturday 8 November 2007, because an ecstasy pill had been 
found in her belongings. In addition, on 9 November 2007, she was punched in the face and 
beaten on her legs with a small iron bar by two prison guards in the guard&#8217;s office in block E 
(post of security). Furthermore, the guards put a table on her legs and sat on it for 30 minutes. 
Whereas she was supposed to be in the punishment cell for a total of one week, she was told that 
she could leave earlier if she paid the warden. 
</p>
<p>22. <b>Ms. Rina</b>, aged 24, from Padang, West Sumatra, was arrested by police officers 
on 18 July 2007 after having stolen a mobile phone and money two weeks earlier in order to be 
able to buy drugs. The officers took Ms. Rina directly to the theft victim&#8217;s house in order to 
broker a &#8220;peace deal&#8221;, meaning that Ms. Rina could avoid further judicial proceedings by paying 
the amount of 7,700,000 IDR (about 820 $US) directly to the victim. However, Ms. Rina 
rejected this settlement since she considered the amount excessive. Subsequently, she was 
transferred to South Jakarta Polres, where she was interrogated. During the questioning which 
lasted for about one hour, the owner of the phone was also present and repeatedly insulted her. 
Ms. Rina was then temporarily detained in a cell on the third floor, which she had to share with 
one other woman and seven men, before being interrogated for a second time on the same day. 
Subsequently, she was transferred to another cell with seven to ten other women, including one 
younger than 18 years old. Food of poor quality was provided to them twice a day. Family visits 
were allowed Mondays and Thursdays from 9 a.m. to 12 a.m., for visits on other days one 
needed to pay. Furthermore, every cell had to pay 250 000 IDR (about 27 $US) in rent and 
so-called &#8220;peace settlements&#8221;, a fee for not being harassed. In addition, each of them had to pay 
30 000 IDR (about 3 $US) per month for electricity and laundry. The payment was made either 
to the head of the cell, who would forward the money to the officers or directly to the officers. 
Those detainees who refused to pay were either beaten up by the officers or had to ask the </p>

<p>persons who visited them to provide the money. If detainees did not receive any visits, they were 
obliged to work for other inmates in return for them settling their &#8220;debts&#8221;. After two months, 
Ms. Rina was transferred to Block A in Pondok Bambu. She had no complaints about 
ill-treatment there.  
</p>
<p>23. <b>Achmad Alfian</b>, aged 20, was arrested by officers of Polsek Tanabang in July 2006 while 
buying drugs. Although he did not resist, he was handcuffed and beaten with the butt of a gun on 
his head. He was then transferred to the Polsek. During the ensuing interrogation he was beaten 
with a rubber stick all over his body, but particularly on his head and back in order to force him 
to confess to being a drug seller. Mr. Alfian refused and was charged. Furthermore, he had to pay 
500 000 IDR (about 53 $US) for being put in a cell which was supposed to be of better quality 
than the others. In September 2006, Mr. Alfian was transferred to Pondok Bambu pre-trial 
detention facility. He constantly feels dizzy and has headaches.

(Visited on 15 November 2007) 
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur was received by Lieutenant Colonel Yarangga and by several 
journalists despite the fact that this was an unannounced visit. The prison has a capacity 
of 230 detainees. On the day of the visit 277 persons were being held at the prison, out of 
whom 10 were women (2 convicted and 8 pre-trial). 111 of the male detainees were convicted, 
106 were in pre-trial detention. In addition, 50 detainees normally in the drug section, which was 
under renovation, were held there. Cells were open from 6 a.m. until 1.30 p.m. and from 3 p.m. 
to 5.30 p.m. All male detainees, including minors, could intermingle in the courtyard during the 
day. There were two punishment cells where persons could be held for up to six days. Five 
prisoners were convicted of treason: Filep Karma, Yusak Pakage as well as Gustaf Ayomi, 
Jean Hesegem and Herry Ass, all three from Makassar.  
</p>
<p>25. Nurses were present all day at the prison and a doctor visits every Friday. Two deaths in 
custody were reported in the last two years, one from TB (he was released just before) and one 
from an overdose. Five detainees are reportedly infected with HIV.  
</p>
<p>26. The Director of the Prison informs the Special Rapporteur that in the beginning of 
November 2007, Dance Ibo, a detainee, told his family about beatings by an officer named 
Kris Wamuar. The family complained to the prison director, who questioned the officer. The 
latter admitted to the beatings and was suspended from his position, but is still serving elsewhere 
in the prison.  
</p>
<p>27. On 15 November 2007 it was reported to the director that a convict had beaten a pre-trial 
detainee. 
</p>
<p>28. According to the prisoners, there used to be regular beatings of new arrivals. However the 
current director stopped this practice. It was reported that a former prisoner from Papua New 
Guinea attempted to escape three months earlier. After his re-arrest he was so heavily beaten that 
his leg broke; he was not taken to a hospital. Many detainees and prisoners complained about the 
food, which consisted mainly of dry rice. In general, the Special Rapporteur was positively 
impressed by the liberal spirit in the prison. </p>

</p>
<p>29. <b>Gananathan Thusyantham</b>, aged 35, a Dutch citizen born in Sri Lanka, was arrested 
on 10 March 2007 by security personnel in a bank in Jayapura, suspected of forgery, and held by 
the local police for 50 days in a small and overcrowded cell with 25 detainees. The food was of 
bad quality so that he had to buy his own food. Also, it was very hot in the cell and there was not 
enough water. After 50 days he was taken to the High Court but no hearing took place. He was 
represented by a lawyer. 
</p>
<p>30. <b>Filep Karma, </b>a well-known political activist, was beaten with rattan sticks on his head 
during his arrest; then he was put in a truck and some police officers were standing on his back 
(main perpetrator: Vice Commander of the Police Robert Washington). He was interrogated day 
and night at the local police office in Abepura. Starting from 27 December 2004 he was in 
pre-trial detention at Abepura Prison. Overall, the prison conditions were acceptable but many 
officers used to get drunk and then beat up detainees. He often complained to the prison 
authorities about the treatment and ill-treatment of others and was therefore repeatedly beaten up 
by the guards Abraham Fingkrew and Kristomos Wamuar.  
</p>
<p>31. <b>Yusak Pakage</b>, another well-known political activist, was arrested by the police at his 
house on 1 December 2004. In 2006 he reportedly received threats from the National Police in 
Jakarta. On 18 August 2006, the Mobile Police reportedly killed his family. On 1 July 2007, one 
of the guards, Abraham Fingkrew, broke the lock of his cell and took him to his office, together 
with Cosmos and Simpson. On 3 July 2007 he was taken to several police stations in Jayapura 
(city police, mobile brigade, and military police) in preparation of a transfer to another prison. 
Refusing the transfer, he went on hunger strike and the chief of police, on 5 July 2007, ordered 
his transfer back to Abepura Prison. Due to his weak health he asked for medical examinations 
outside the prison, but the request was turned down. On 19 July 2007 he was taken to the 
prosecutor&#8217;s office, where he was forced to sign a letter. He also reported that his brother was 
shot in the leg (see Polsek Abepura). 
</p>
<p>32. <b>Selpins Bobii</b>, from East Timor, was arrested by the city police of Abepura 
on 16 March 2006 by four officers. When he was thrown into a truck, he lost his glasses. Then 
he was taken to the police station. He was beaten with fists and boots until he fainted. On the 
next day he was taken to the provincial police, where he stayed for two weeks, during which the 
officers poured hot water on him, beat him with an iron bar, wooden and rattan sticks, and 
subjected him to electric shocks with a black electroshock device.  
33. <b>Hendra Ruver</b>, aged 27, was taken to Abepura Prison on 24 August 2004. He had asked 
permission from the officer to go outside the prison for one day to meet his family, but then 
stayed outside for one year and nine months because he was afraid to return to the prison. When 
he finally returned on 13 September 2007, he was severely beaten with fists and sticks by prison 
guards Hutabarat and Iriantopakombong. His parents complained to the director of the prison. He 
had already been beaten in September 2005 on his legs with iron sticks.  
</p>
<p>34. <b>Luis Tuti, </b>aged 26, from Papua Sarwi, had been detained in the prison since January 2006. 
In January 2007 he escaped. In March 2007 he had a motorcycle accident and sustained a serious 
injury on his right food. In April 2007, Luis Tuti was re-arrested by the police and taken to 
Polres Jayapura where was kept for three days. The first days he was beaten by the officer 
Eli Awi. Then he was transferred to Abepura Prison. On 13 May 2007, he was assaulted by a </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.7 
page 34 
 
</p>
<p>prison guard and subsequently detained for one month in solitary confinement. During that time, 
he was not allowed to have visits from outside the prison; however other inmates could visit him. 
The wound on his foot was still infected and he had difficulties to walk. According to the 
forensic expert, he is in need of medical treatment.  
</p>
<p>35. <b>Heri Asso, Gustaf Ayomi and Jean Hasegem</b> had been arrested in Wamena in 2003. 
During the interrogation of Gustaf Ayomi in an office of the criminal investigation department at 
Polres Jayawijaya, Wamena, officers put a leg of a chair on his thigh and sat on the chair. While 
experiencing severe pain, Ayomi was forced to keep the upper part of his body in a stressful 
upright position. Additionally, he was beaten with a stick all over his body, but particularly on 
his head. The ill-treatment lasted for an entire week, after which he was put into a small cell. He 
was not able to stand or walk for an entire week. Hasegem was interrogated separately by 
different officers at Polres Jayawijaya, Wamena. During the interrogation he was kicked and 
punched while being tied to a chair. His interrogation also lasted for about one week. Afterwards 
he was locked up in a small cell with eight other detainees. Asso was injured during the arrest 
and had to spend one week in hospital. Afterwards, he was transferred to Polres Wamena as well.  
</p>
<p>36. During their trial proceedings before Wamena District Court, the group was represented by 
a State-appointed lawyer, who did not properly defend them. After the verdict, they were sent to 
Wamena prison. On 15 December 2004, a prison guard approached the group after lunch and 
invited them to a surprise Christmas party. They were taken to an office which members of the 
mobile police force entered to take the group, against their will, to the airport in order to 
transport them to Makassar prison. Their lawyers, families and friends had not been informed of 
the transfer. During the flight they were handcuffed. When they arrived at Makassar airport, 
officers chased them out of the plane by kicking them with their boots and hitting them with the 
butts of their rifles. Some of the detainees started bleeding. They had no complaints regarding 
Makassar prison. They received good vocational training. More than two years later, on 
27 March 2007, Heri Asso, Gustaf Ayomi and Jean Hasegem were transferred from Makassar to 
Abepura. During the flight, they were again handcuffed; their feet were fixed with expanders and 
swelled up so that they were unable to stand or walk after the flight. Upon the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s visit on 16 November the group was detained in building 17 of Abepura prison. 
They said that on 1 July 2007 members of the mobile police, the city police and the military 
police transported them to the main police station in Jayapura, supposedly in an attempt to 
forward them to another prison outside of Papua. They were kept in custody together with 
Mr. Cosmos and Mr. Simpson until 5 July. On the third day, the group started a hunger strike, 
following which the head of Polsek sent them back to the prison in Abepura. Due to their weak 
health the detainees asked for medical examinations outside the prison, but their request was 
turned down. On 19 July 2007 they were again picked up by the police this time by truck, and 
transported to the office of the prosecutor. The detainees emphasized that the transport was a 
terrifying experience, due to the speed and style of driving. At the office, they were forced to 
sign a document. As for the conditions of detention, the group reports that some guards regularly 
get drunk and enter the detainees&#8217; cell in order to extract money. All three voiced concern 
regarding the safety of their families, who had been repeatedly threatened in the past.  
</p>
<p>37. <b>Women&#8217;s wing</b>: Ten women (eight of which are convicts) were detained in three different 
cells. Overall the conditions were acceptable; the cells were clean and the women were allowed 
to use mobile phones and had access to additional food, coffee, etc. Most of the women had </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/3/Add.7 
  page 35 
 
</p>
<p>mattresses which they brought from outside. Disciplinary measures for persons who violated the 
rules were detention in solitary confinement for up to eight days and restriction of visits. Nine 
women and four babies were present. The babies were allowed to stay with their mothers up to 
two years, but needed to be fed by the families. The women reported that often there was not 
enough water. In principle, the families were allowed to visit them at any time, but most often 
one had to pay the officer on duty to be allowed to do so. Women are allowed to go out of the 
prison for one day, if they pay the guards. There were seven female officers. 
</p>
<p>38. <b>Female detainee</b>, was arrested in September 2007 by one of her relatives, who shouted at 
her and handcuffed her. He then took her to Polsek and the prosecutor immediately signed her 
transfer to the prison.  
</p>
<p>39. <b>Ms. Sunarti</b>, aged 42, from Makassar, was convicted to seven months in prison for 
gambling. She was arrested by six policemen on 14 March 2007. She was transferred to Polsek, 
where she stayed for one week, after which she was released because of her baby. On 
8 May 2007 she was taken to the prison. She reported that some weeks ago when she asked an 
officer whether she could go home, she was insulted and beaten in front of her husband. When 
they tried to file a complaint, instead of launching an investigation, the police asked for 
documents that could prove their allegations.  
</p>
<p>40. <b>Minor&#8217;s cell</b>: Four boys were detained in the cell; one of them aged 14, the others 17 
and 18; all of them were very hesitant to speak to the Special Rapporteur. One of them had bad 
pain in his stomach. Although the nurse had given him medicine, his situation had not improved. 
He had not seen a doctor. According to the forensic doctor, he was in need of medical 
examination and treatment.  
</p>
<p>41. <b>Salmon</b>, aged 18, from Papua. He was arrested at the seaport of Jayapura by two 
policemen (KP3 LAUT). They had beaten him with their hands in his face during the arrest. He 
was held at the police station for 28 days, but not ill-treated any more. However, he was 
subjected to threats.  
</p>
<p><b>MILITARY PRISON ABEPURA (PAPUA) 
</b>(Visited on 15 November 2007) 
</p>
<p>42. Since the chief of the Military Detention Facility, 1st Lieutenant Yaman, was absent the 
Special Rapporteur interacted with the officer in charge, Colonel Marcus Paya, Commander of 
the Military Police. The day of the visit, 13 persons were detained in the facility, 6 men were 
held in the punishment cells. All of them were sentenced by the Military Court in Jayapura. for 
charges such as &#8220;indecency&#8221; or deserting. The longest sentence was 18 months, the lowest 
8 months. The Special Rapporteur had to make several phone calls until he was granted access. 
But in violation of the terms of reference of the Special Rapporteur, Colonel Paya restricted the 
possibility of the Special Rapporteur to interview detainees in private. As a consequence, most 
detainees did not wish to speak to the Special Rapporteur. Others preferred to talk about their 
cases rather than about their treatment during detention.  
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur notes with strong regret that this facility had not been mentioned 
on the list of military prisons provided by the authorities in Jakarta. </p>

</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur was received by the Director of the prison, Mr. Hendro Sekaryan. 
The total capacity of the institution is 114. On the day of the visit, the prison counted 
111 detainees; 58 of them were convicts and 53 pre-trial detainees. Six of the latter were women. 
Two children (one boy and one girl) were staying respectively with their father and mother in the 
prison. Women are detained separately, but have to use the same courtyard as men when they 
want to leave their cell. The conditions in the prison are generally good. 
</p>
<p>45. The cell for newcomers is completely dark and hot and lacks ventilation. In principal, 
every new arrival is detained in this cell for three days and nights; however the length of 
detention in this cell seemed to be handled liberally. In addition, the Special Rapporteur received 
some reports that newcomers have to do push-ups, squats and other exercises in front of the other 
prisoners as a &#8220;welcome ceremony&#8221;. Some prisoners were reportedly beaten. Violation of the 
prison rules by detainees (e.g. attempts to escape and late return from their &#8220;errands&#8221;) was 
sometimes punished by beatings and several weeks in the newcomer&#8217;s cell, which amounts to 
inhuman and degrading treatment. The guard Herman Matuan was known for beating the 
detainees when he was drunk. Many prisoners complained about the quality of the food. 
</p>
<p>46. The medical unit had no equipment due to lack of funds. There was one mentally ill 
prisoner, whom the director would like to transfer to a psychiatric hospital. No death in detention 
had been reported in the last two years.  
</p>
<p>47. <b>Prisoner</b>, aged 31. His five-year-old boy stays with him in prison. He had to stay in the 
&#8220;welcome cell&#8221; for two days upon his arrival, which he perceived &#8220;as if he could not survive&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>48. <b>Prisoner</b>, aged 25, was arrested together with friends on 3 September 2007 in Wamena by 
nine officers from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and subsequently taken to 
Polres, where they stayed for 15 days. Upon arrival at the Polres, he and his friends were slapped 
by the previous head of the CID, Alex Bleskadit, in his room. One of his friends was reportedly 
beaten so strongly that his ear started bleeding. He informed the Special Rapporteur that due to 
the high number of new arrivals (20 persons) at the prison, he and his friends were not detained 
in the newcomers&#8217; cell. He had no complaints about the conditions in prison; the prisoners are 
allowed to play football, listen to music etc.

<p>50. The Special Rapporteur was received by the chief of police, Marolop Manik, and the chief 
of CID, Mr Erlangga (the latter had served at Polres Jayawijaya only for one week). The 
detention facility, located at the entry post, consists of two small cells (175x175 cm). The day of 
the visit, there were five detainees dressed in new uniforms which they had received that same 
morning. They had been informed beforehand about the visit of the Special Rapporteur. </p>

</p>
<p>51. <b>Fermenas Kogoya</b>, aged 37, had wounds in his face and reported that he had been beaten 
by the family of a girl who alleged that he had raped her on 14 November 2007. The police had 
taken him to the hospital first and then to the police station.  
</p>
<p>52. <b>Beremius Wanimbo,</b> aged 20, from Digimie Village, was arrested a few hours prior to the 
visit of the Special Rapporteur by members of the police pursuant to allegations of having raped 
a 13-year-old girl the night before and was subsequently taken to the Polres. There, he was 
confronted with the family of the rape victim, including the girl herself and a tribal chief. The 
police officers and the family proposed Mr. Wanimbo to solve the issue in a traditional, amicable 
way, meaning that he would be able to leave for an apology and the payment of 500,000 IDR 
(about 50$US) to the family. When Mr. Wanimbo denied any wrongdoing, the officers stripped 
him to the waist and started to beat and kick him. Mr. Wanimbu was punched several times in 
the face and the chest. At one point also the chief of the family gave him a strong blow on his 
face. The beating stopped when the Special Rapporteur arrived at the Polres. Mr. Wanimbo was 
about to put on his clothes when the Special Rapporteur entered the room. During the interview 
he was crying and shaking, and his allegations were corroborated by forensic evidence. The 
officer mainly responsible for the beatings was Erwin Banamasa, who admitted to it in front of 
the Special Rapporteur, the Chief of CID and the chief of police. 
</p>
<p>53. Subsequently the Special Rapporteur accompanied Mr. Wanimbu to the local hospital 
(Unit Gawat Darurat) in order to ensure that first aid would be provided and the medical 
evidence recorded. The doctor in charge, Dr. Prapti Dewi Suhirman, reported that the police 
came frequently to demand medical reports on injured detainees, but these documents were made 
available only to the police and not to the victim. Mr. Wanimbo received treatment at the 
hospital, but was later handed back to the officers of the Public Service Post, where he had been 
tortured earlier.  
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur returned to the Polres on 17 November, in order to follow up. He 
was informed and shown documents indicating that disciplinary investigations were conducted 
by the Department for internal investigations, PROVOS, and concluded in the course of 
16 November. The officers Erwin Banamasa, Maxon Yappo, Hermanus Karubaba and 
Nikolas Nelson Yerisetouw received a written warning and 21 days of disciplinary detention. 
Erwin Banamasa, who was the highest ranking officer, was additionally excluded from any 
training for one year. The criminal investigations based on article 352 (ill-treatment) were still 
ongoing. Banamasa complained to the Special Rapporteur that the ill-treatment of Wanimbo was 
a &#8220;light case&#8221;, and that the proceedings against him were &#8220;exaggerated&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>55. <b>Mr. Hermamante,</b> aged 31, from Timin, had been detained at the Polres for 16 days and 
indicated that a week earlier the cells had been overcrowded with up to 32 persons in the facility. 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur trusts that the criminal investigation in relation to the abuse of 
Beremius Wanimbo will be conducted in an impartial and independent manner and be concluded 
without further delay. He wishes to be informed about the outcome of the criminal investigation.  </p>

The facility consisted of three cells. On the day of the visit, the five detainees present were 
dressed in new uniforms which they had received the same morning, reportedly because of the 
visit of the Special Rapporteur. The detainees also indicated that they had received better food 
than usually. No complaint related to ill-treatment was made. A journalist in detention 
complained that he had no right to appeal his detention to a court.

that he could not obtain a postponement of the detention.

(Brigpol). The detention facility consisted of two cells which were empty at the time of the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit. Generally, the officers explained that they tried to solve cases through 
community-based mediation and policing (Forum Kemitraan Polisi Masyarakat). No register was 
kept, but the officers maintained that the detention cells had not been used since August 2007 
and that all detainees were being transferred immediately to Wamena. However, according to 
several graffiti and carvings on the walls of the cells, several persons had been detained for 
several days in this detention facility. The graffiti mentioned &#8220;suffering&#8221; and lack of food. One 
scribble apparently originated from a person held on 9 November 2007, which was in 
contradiction with the information provided by the officers. When confronted with the graffiti, 
Mr. Mebel explained that drunk persons were frequently kept in the cells for their own safety. 
However, since these persons were not considered &#8220;detainees&#8221; they were not noted in the 
register.

Mr. Hajeri explained that since the cells were not sufficiently clean, detainees had been 
transferred to Polres Jayawijaya, Wamena, for the preceding six months. The register of 
detainees, which included a number of inconsistencies, indicated that the last person had been 
detained there in May 2007. However, graffiti in the cells indicated that persons were locked up 
in the cells in June and July 2007. Confronted with this, Mr. Hajeri explained that drunk persons 
would be detained for one day or one night and that they were not considered as detainees. The 
alleged corresponding register however only contained the date of the arrest and did not include 
any information on the date of release, undermining safeguards against ill-treatment.  </p>

<p>62. The Special Rapporteur was able to enter the detention facility only after a considerable 
period of waiting and discussions, but was finally received by Bominus Rumaropen (head of the 
Polsek). There were 11 detainees, two of whom were hidden in a separate interrogation room 
behind locked doors. The Special Rapporteur could only talk to them after insisting that the 
doors be opened. The youngest detainee was 13 years old. The facility consisted of three very 
dark cells (about 2m x8 m) lit by a lamp and little natural light coming in through small holes in 
the wall. The detainees had to sleep on mattresses they brought from home. 
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur met a detainee he had interviewed in Polres Wamena (see above): 
<b>Fermenas Kogoya</b>, who repeated his earlier story and reported that no violence was used against 
him. He was worried that in Abepura he would receive no food since his family was in Wamena 
and therefore not able to bring him food.  
</p>
<p>64. <b>Yusus Jamera</b>, aged 22, from Jayapura, was arrested in Abepura on 16 October 2007 by 
his uncle who works in a detention house. He was then transferred to Polsek on the same day. 
During interrogation he was reportedly beaten with hands and wooden and iron sticks, on the 
lower back and the head, by an officer called Samalu until he confessed. Since then he had not 
experienced any more violence, but he complained about the insufficient quantity of food and 
water and explained that two or three detainees have to share one meal.  
</p>
<p>65. The two detainees who were hidden from the Special Rapporteur were convicted prisoners 
who were sent back from Abepura Prison to this police station for reasons which remain unclear. 
The police chief indicated that he had already tried to send them back. One of the detainees was 
the brother of Yusak Pakage, who was sentenced for the murder of a policeman during the riots 
of 15 March 2006 to 15 years&#8217; imprisonment (and was interviewed by the Special Rapporteur in 
Wamena prison; see above). He informed the Special Rapporteur that he was arrested one day 
after these riots and, since he did not confess, was shot in the leg at short range. 
</p>
<p>66. <b>Habel Gombo</b>, aged 20, from Dock 5 in Jayapura, was arrested on 6 November 2007. He 
was caught by the public after he tried to rob a lady at the market in Abepura and was 
subsequently taken to the police post at the market. Upon arrival there, three police officers 
punched him in the face and the upper body and beat him with a rubber stick on his head and 
back. In the course of the beatings his left cheek started bleeding. The robbed woman was 
present all the time of the beating and shouted insults. The injury on this cheek was examined by 
the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s forensic expert who concluded that the wound corroborated 
Mr. Gombo&#8217;s statement. On the same day Mr. Gombo was transferred to Polsek Abepura. Once 
he arrived there, three police officers, among them the commander on duty, jumped on his feet 
with their heavy combat boots. Mr. Gombo had not been interrogated and he did not know for 
how long he would have to stay at the Polsek or whether or when his case would be forwarded to 
the prosecutor.  </p>

</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur was received by the Deputy Chief of the Criminal Investigation 
Department, Piet Waine, and the Chief of the Unit on Special Crime in CID, Irianto John. 
13 detainees were in the cells when the Special Rapporteur arrived. Some walls had been painted 
and the whole facility cleaned prior to the visit of the Special Rapporteur. Several of the 
detainees mentioned that they did not receive any food because they were under the authority of 
the prosecutor. The management explained that as soon as the detention of a person was 
authorized by the prosecutor, the responsibility to provide food or at least to reimburse the police 
station shifted to the prosecutor. Since the prosecutor had not paid, the detainees under the 
authority of the prosecutor did not receive food. The Special Rapporteur asked the management 
that one prisoner who was guarded by the police station on behalf of Abepura Prison should 
immediately be transferred back. 
</p>
<p>68. In the women&#8217;s cell, there were six women and one 14-year-old boy who was 
exceptionally allowed to stay with his mother. All detained women had children. The women 
were detained in late August 2007 in two separate cases. They were allowed to leave the cell 
once a week. Since there was no toilet in the cell they had to call the guards when they wanted to 
relieve themselves. In general, this worked well, but sometimes the guards did not come to open 
the doors immediately, which meant that the women had to use plastic containers. They were 
allowed to receive visitors. One woman complained about headaches and, according to the 
doctor, received appropriate treatment.  
</p>
<p>69. <b>Four women</b> were detainees under police authority; they were interrogated after their 
arrest on 29 and 30 August 2007 and reported that no violence had been used. They had not seen 
a judge and were not informed about any developments of their case. They had attempted to be 
released on bail in order to be able to look after their children, but were not successful.  
</p>
<p>70. The remaining <b>two women</b> (detainees under the prosecutor&#8217;s authority) were charged with 
drug related crimes. They reported that they had been beaten and slapped during their arrest for 
one hour by the police to extract confessions and information about the drug providers (which 
they refused to report to the police). They reportedly sustained bruises on arms and some scars, 
which were not visible any more. They complained that since they were detained under the 
prosecutor&#8217;s authority, they were not provided with food.  
</p>
<p>71. <b>Detainee,</b> charged with drug related crimes, complained about threats and beatings during 
detention.  
</p>
<p>72. <b>Detainee,</b> complained about being forced to jump and squat in front of others, which he 
perceived as being humiliating.  
</p>
<p>73. <b>Detainee</b>, aged 40, accused of a drug crime, was arrested on 27 August 2007 by seven 
drug police officers under the command of Iptu Alawah in his room in Jayapura. Upon his arrest 
he was handcuffed, forced to sit and beaten and kicked by them. They reportedly also stepped on 
his body and legs. He further complained about the lack of food. </p>

</p>
<p>74. <b>Mr. Muslimin</b>, aged 35, from Ujune Pandane, was arrested on allegations of selling 
alcohol and violating health provisions. Members of the police entered his house on the evening 
of 29 August 2007 and collected his driving licence. Subsequently, the police searched his house 
without having presented a warrant and demolished most of his furniture. Mr. Muslimin, 
together with another man and six women from his neighbourhood, was taken to the Polda, 
where he was interrogated for the first and only time. Since then, he had not been interviewed by 
an officer and his case had not been processed. A request for a release on bail had been denied. 
Mr. Muslimin experienced the unclear status of his case as &#8220;mental torture&#8221; since he had been in 
detention for three months without knowing what would happen next.  
</p>
<p>75. <b>Sabar Olif Iwanggin</b>, aged 34, from Asal, human rights lawyer by profession, was 
arrested on 18 October 2007 on charges of distributing a text message via his cell phone 
defaming the President of the Republic. During a meeting with Aloysius Renwarin, 
some 30 officers of the anti-terrorism unit Detachment 88, the criminal investigation police of 
POLDA and the Anti-Terror Special Force Unit of the National Police surrounded the building 
and arrested Sabar Olif. He was taken to Polda where he was interrogated from 3.30 p.m. until 5 
a.m. the next morning by Polda officers. During the interrogation water was served; however, he 
felt extremely tired and depressed. On 20 October, at 10 a.m., the interrogation continued, this 
time conducted by officers of Detachment 88 who questioned him on his relation with the Free 
Papua Movement, OPM, and his involvement in the Abepura case as a human rights lawyer. Mr. 
Olif had no complaints about any ill-treatment; however, he was not allowed to meet with his 
lawyer and too tired to sign his own statement. On 26 October, Sabar Olif was transferred to 
Jakarta on a commercial flight during which he was not handcuffed. The transfer to Jakarta had 
not been announced, neither he nor his lawyer were informed in advance. He was in detention in 
Jakarta police headquarters from 27 October to 11 November, where he was interrogated two 
times. Sabar Olif&#8217;s main concern was that he had no idea of how long he would remain in 
detention. His case had not yet been forwarded to the prosecutor and his detention had been 
prolonged repeatedly. Sabar Olif perceived his treatment as discriminatory and related to his 
engagement as a human rights lawyer. 
</p>
<p><b>MAKASSAR CENTRAL PRISON FOR CONVICTS (SULAWESI) 
</b>(Visited on 18 November 2007) 
</p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur was received by the chief of the facility, Mr. Yudotomo, and 
Mr. Ridwan. The capacity of the prison was 1,000. On the day of the visit there were 
511 convicts, out of whom 52 were women detained in a separate block lacking space for 
exercising. The detainees who supervised the others were wearing blue T-shirts. Visits were 
possible three times a week. 
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur received consistent allegations of corporal punishment in the form 
of beatings if the prisoners broke the rules. The ill-treatment reportedly took place in the 
officers&#8217; room or at the front where other detainees and prison staff could watch.  
</p>
<p>78. The quarantine had several cells which were used for mentally ill detainees and for 
disciplinary purposes. However, the persons interviewed all insisted that they had moved to these 
cells voluntarily, although it turned out later that some of the detainees there had tried to escape 
and had been put in the isolation cells in spring 2007. One person complained about back pains, 
but was examined by the prison doctor and received medicine.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.7

</p>
<p>79. The prison had a special cell for new arrivals which was very dirty. Generally, persons 
were reportedly detained in these cells between one and two weeks. The day of the visit of the 
Special Rapporteur one person from Ambon was being held there.  
</p>
<p>80. <b>R.</b>, aged 25, from Makassar, was arrested on 25 May 2006 by the drug police. He was 
kicked in the stomach and hit on the face in the street for one hour, when he refused to tell where 
his drugs came from. He was then transferred to POLSEC Mamadjanj, where the beatings 
continued and he was hit with wooden sticks and hands all night until he told the names of the 
drug sellers. On 4 July 2006, he was transferred to the State Detention House and on 
22 November 2006 to the prison. He complained that no drug treatment was available, but also 
reported that voluntary HIV testing and free HIV treatment was provided. Payments needed to be 
made for bringing in a TV and other &#8220;services&#8221;. He also mentioned with astonishment that 
release on parole is free of charge in other countries. 
</p>
<p><b>MILITARY (MASMIL) DETENTION CENTRE, MAKASSAR (SULAWESI) 
</b>(Visited on 18 November 2007) 
</p>
<p>81. Although this was an unannounced visit, the Special Rapporteur was welcomed by photo 
journalists at the gate of the Masmil. The head of the military detention centres unit from the 
Armed Forces Headquarters in Jakarta, Colonel Wahjono, had arrived from Jakarta for the visit 
of the Special Rapporteur, which the Special Rapporteur interpreted as confirming that his 
movements throughout the country were monitored by Indonesian authorities. At the airport of 
Makassar, the Special Rapporteur identified a plain-clothes officer of the regional military 
command (Mr. Ramli, Nr. 21940002670572) who admitted after initial hesitation that he had 
been ordered to report to his superiors on the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s arrival at and departure from 
the island. Major Daud (Navy) was in charge of the convicted prisoners; Captain Basuki was in 
charge of the pre-trial detainees.  
</p>
<p>82. The day of the visit the administration counted 51 convicts and 7 pre-trial detainees, who 
were detained in a separate wing. According to the information received the food was of bad 
quality. Newly arrived persons were routinely forced to do exercises such as somersaults in the 
courtyard of the institution while all other detainees were watching. All new arrivals had their 
heads shaved and had to spend a week in a dark single cell the doors of which were always 
closed. Detention in such conditions amounts to degrading and inhuman treatment. The detainees 
were very afraid and hesitant to speak to the Special Rapporteur. The Special Rapporteur further 
came across one detainee who was detained as a punishment for having married without seeking 
the permission of his superior. 
</p>
<p><b>POLDA MAKASSAR (SULAWESI) 
</b>(Visited on 18 November 2007) 
</p>
<p>83. The Special Rapporteur was received by Mr. P. Harrono, officer in charge. All officers 
present and detainees made it clear that the visit of the Special Rapporteur had been previously 
announced. 38 detainees were detained in one big cell, the youngest person was 17. The smaller 
cells were not in use. Detainees had only limited access to fresh air and the hygienic conditions 
were not satisfactory. It was reported that the quality of the food was bad and there was not </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/3/Add.7 
  page 43 
 
</p>
<p>sufficient drinking water. Detainees reportedly had to pay a fee of 10,000 IDR (about 1 $US) in 
&#8220;rent&#8221; to the police. If they did not pay, they reportedly risked being locked up in small single 
cells. 
</p>
<p>84. <b>Martin,</b> aged 47, had been detained at the Polda for 23 days. He reported that in early 
November 2007 a detainee had been beaten by an officer. Two other detainees (Martin and a 
co-inmate) called the chief of disciplinary police by telephone and reported the incident. 
Consequently, Martin was detained in a single cell for four days as a punishment. 
</p>
<p><b>POLSEK SIDEMEN (BALI) 
</b>(Visited on 19 November 2007) 
</p>
<p>85. Because so many of the detention facilities the Special Rapporteur had visited in Papua and 
Sulawesi had clearly been awaiting him, he decided not to visit the prison and main police 
stations in Bali. He rather carried out unannounced visits to smaller police stations away from 
Kuta. At the Polsek Sedemen, the Special Rapporteur was received by Ngh. Karya, Head of 
Polsek, and Nyomad Sari, Head of the Criminal Investigation Department, who all cooperated 
fully with the Special Rapporteur. There were no detainees in the only cell. 
</p>
<p>86. <b>Iwayan Riko al Segol</b>, aged 32, had allegedly committed suicide on 18 November 2007, 
the day before the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit. The police presented the Special Rapporteur with 
photos showing him hanging from the roof of an open cell (bars on the ceiling) with both feet 
touching the ground. According to Officer Gede Suntal who found the body, he had seen 
Mr Riko still alive on Sunday (18 November 2007) at 5.30 a.m. At his next check at 6.30 a.m. 
the same morning he found Mr. Riko suspended from the ceiling. He immediately called a doctor 
(Dr. Yehezkiel from nearby Pukemas Sidemen), who arrived at 6.45 a.m. and certified his death, 
but did not conduct any medical examinations regarding the cause of death. He did not remove 
the sarong (traditional Indonesian piece of clothing) with which he had strangled himself. The 
body had been buried the same day because the family allegedly did not wish an autopsy to be 
performed.  
</p>
<p>87. The Special Rapporteur and the forensic doctor had serious doubts whether the suicide 
could have been performed by Mr. Riko without having used a chair, as was explained by the 
police officers. He went to the hospital and spoke to the doctor who had found the dead body the 
day before. The doctor and his superior confirmed that the doctor had not performed any medical 
examinations or an autopsy. The Special Rapporteur recommends that autopsies should be 
mandatory in all cases of death in detention.

</p>
<p>88. The Special Rapporteur was received by Dedy Dhia Dharma, head of Polres, who reported 
that he regularly inspects detention places without announcement, but has not received any 
complaints since he was appointed in early 2007. Local NGOs (Garansy, Gappar, Baraf) 
regularly visit detainees. The cells were located on the fifth floor, with daylight and good 
ventilation, but not particularly clean. Visits were allowed every day from 2.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m., 
on weekends from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. There were eight detainees in one cell. </p>

</p>
<p>89. <b>Anak Agung Gede Oka,</b> aged 38, was arrested on 15 November 2007 at Peta village 
by the police, and was taken to Polsek Gyanyar, where he was interrogated. He stayed there 
until 17 November and was then transferred to the Polres. He had no complaints about the police 
station; he received food twice a day. There was no violence and the doctor examined them. He 
mainly suffered from the fact that he was unable to pay the school fee of his 10-year-old child.  
</p>
<p>90. <b>Wayan Denia</b>, aged 57, from Bali, was arrested on 10 November 2007 at his home by the 
police for a minor offence. He was taken to Polres where he was interrogated in an office in 
which he had to stay until the early morning of 12 November 2007. Only then was he taken to 
the cell. He was informed that he had the right to a lawyer; but could not afford one. He 
complained about the lack of drinking water.  
</p>
<p><b>JUVENILE DETENTION CENTRE KUTOARJO (JAVA) 
</b>(Visited on 20 November 2007) 
</p>
<p>91. The prison had a population of 82 detainees (71 convicted, 10 pre-trial, 1 girl), and a 
capacity of 116. The youngest detainee was 10 years old. The only girl was detained in a 
separate cell. Staff comprised 55 men and 14 women. The cells were grouped around a large 
courtyard. Their size was about 1,6m x 4 m (including the toilet). Around seven boys sleep in 
each cell. Families can visit, but are not allowed to stay longer than 30 minutes. The Special 
Rapporteur received numerous allegations of corporal punishment, including beatings with fists, 
rattan sticks and brooms as well as degrading exercises (&#8220;duck walk&#8221; in front of other detainees). 
The punishment takes place either in the guards&#8217; room or in the courtyard in the presence of the 
other detainees. Normally the boys try to hide traces of beatings in order to avoid trouble, 
however a doctor who comes once a month has noticed traces of the beatings and asked the 
guards to stop it. Furthermore, the boys can be detained in closed punishment cells for up to 
three days as a form of disciplinary measure. Confronted with these allegations, the Deputy 
Director, RS Suwardi, admitted that beatings are a common practice if detainees break the rules. 
The beating is decided spontaneously and without reference to any rules. 
</p>
<p>92. <b>Detainee</b>, aged 18, was arrested on 24 November 2003. He cannot count how often he has 
been beaten by the prison guards, typically with fists and sticks to punish him after fights with 
other boys. Prisoners can go to school within the facility. His family visits him once a month. 
Before his detention in the Juvenile Centre he was held in custody for a month in Polres 
Remband, North Beach. He was heavily beaten for a whole week with wooden and rattan sticks 
by police officers.  
</p>
<p>93. <b>Two boys, aged 17 and 18,</b> report that they were beaten by prison guards after a fight with 
other detainees some two months ago.  
</p>
<p><b>BATU PRISON ON NUSA KAMBANGAN (JAVA) 
</b>(Visited on 20 November 2007) 
</p>
<p>94. The Special Rapporteur was received by the Deputy Director Djaja Tjahjana 
(Kabid Pembinaan Napi) in the prison, which was fairly new and high security. There were 
191 prisoners, out of whom nine were on death row, including the three persons charged with the 
Bali bombings of 2002, which caused the death of 202 persons in the vacation resort of Kuta. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/3/Add.7 
  page 45 
 
</p>
<p>Most of the persons on death row intermingle freely with the other prisoners. The three &#8220;Bali 
bombers&#8221; and three detainees punished for an attempted escape were held in solitary 
confinement cells. There were eight individual cells with two rooms each (prisoners could retreat 
to the back rooms and have fresh air in the front part). One of the condemned was obviously 
mentally ill, and another prisoner was taking care of him.  
</p>
<p>95. While two of the &#8220;Bali bombers&#8221; refused to speak with the Special Rapporteur, the third 
one, Mr. Ambrosi, was willing to conduct a short interview. He reported that he had been 
severely tortured during his interrogations but that he did not wish to give any details. He also 
insisted that he did not wish to have his death sentence commuted to imprisonment. He was 
ready to be executed and did not express any remorse. 
</p>
<p><b>PASIR PUTIH MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON, NUSA KAMBANGAN 
</b>(Visited on 20 November 2007) 
</p>
<p>96. The prison was opened in June 2007 and had a capacity of 336 persons. It was the top 
maximum security prison in the country, built with the assistance of the United States and the 
European Union at an extremely isolated location. When the Special Rapporteur visited, 
251 prisoners, among them 88 foreigners, were held there. 43 detainees, all of whom were 
allowed to intermingle freely with other prisoners, were on death row. The overwhelming 
majority of prisoners on death row were sentenced for drug related crimes. The Special 
Rapporteur notes with satisfaction that he has not received one single allegation regarding 
ill-treatment in Pasir Putih. The main complaints pertained to the isolated location of the facility 
and problems related to the fact that construction was still ongoing. 
</p>
<p>97. The Special Rapporteur received information that two persons had died at the prison since 
June 2007 because of insufficient medical treatment. The prison director, Harun Sulianto, 
admitted that there were some shortcomings with regard to access to health service and indicated 
that the recruitment of a doctor was under way. He was also aware of every single health 
problem and promised to ensure that two diabetes cases (Benni Sabri and Taufani Rab) would 
receive proper treatment. One time the prison had been flooded. For this reason, the cell doors 
were not closed any more since then. Some reported that the police who guarded the prison 
entered on one occasion, but retreated when the prisoners protested.  
</p>
<p>98. Further complaints concerned the transfer to the prison in July 2007, of which prisoners or 
their lawyers or family members had not been informed beforehand. During the transfer 
detainees were handcuffed together, chained to the floor and blindfolded for 14 hours. According 
to the prisoners, this treatment resembled that inflicted by the CIA during rendition flights.  
</p>
<p>99. <b>Nikolas Ganich</b>, aged 63, Dutch citizen, was arrested on 11 November 2005 in Banten 
Province by the police and sentenced to death for a drug related crime. He was slapped by the 
police and threatened with being shot during interrogation. For six months he was in police 
custody before being moved to a number of prisons. Among all the prisons he has been to, he 
considers Cipinang and Tangerang the worst, inter alia because of the inter-prisoner violence. 
The main problem with Pasir Putih is that prisoners cannot even call their families, which is 
possible everywhere else. The food is not very good, but those who have money can buy better 
food.  </p>

<p>100. <b>Jean Wickara</b>, aged 29, from Swaziland, was arrested in September 2002 by the police in 
Jakarta and taken to Polres Central Jakarta, where he was severely punched and kicked and his 
head smashed against the wall until he made a confession. He sustained serious internal injuries, 
but did not receive any medical treatment. Four days after the arrest he was transferred to Polda. 
Mr. Wickara had a lawyer, but he was not able to help him. He received a 16-year sentence 
although there was no evidence except his confession. Mr. Wickara voiced no complaints about 
Pasir Putih, except for the bad quality of the food.  
</p>
<p>101. <b>Angkiem Soei</b>, aged 55, Dutch citizen, was arrested in 2002 in Jakarta and taken to a hotel, 
where he was blindfolded and beaten many times to force him to sign a confession. He was held 
in police custody for several months at POSTPOL Senopati and later transferred to Polda. He 
suffers from the bad food and the isolation.  
</p>
<p>102. <b>Hilary Chimezie</b>, aged 40, Nigerian citizen, was arrested on 29 August 2002 by police in 
Jakarta. He then spent four months at Polda before his case went on trial for the first time, after 
which he was returned to Polda and held there for another four months. During his time in police 
custody he was severely beaten with a hammer, as a result of which his leg was broken. He still 
has difficulties walking. He was also beaten on the chest. He did not receive any medical 
treatment. At one point his lawyer was beaten as well, after which he withdrew from the case. He 
then received a State-appointed lawyer. He has no complaints about the prison.  
</p>
<p>103. <b>Rodrigo Muxfeldt Gularte</b>, Brazilian citizen, arrested in August 2004 by airport police in 
Jakarta. He was not tortured, but the transfer from Jakarta to Pasir Putih was brutal. The 
prisoners had their hands and feet taped together and handcuffed to other prisoners. While they 
were sitting on the floor of the plane, they were beaten.  
</p>
<p>104. <b>Anthony Osborne</b> <b>alias Michael Smith</b>, aged 32, Nigerian citizen, confirms the 
allegations of the harsh transfer. He stayed in several bad prisons, such as Salemba, Tangerang, 
but the worst was Cipinang.  
</p>
<p>105. <b>Ekpeje Samuel</b>, Nigerian citizen, informed the Special Rapporteur that he is sentenced to 
death based on a confession made under torture. 
</p>
<p>106. <b>Thomas Daniel</b>, Angolan citizen, was sick and suffered from depression. He reported that 
he did not receive the medical treatment he needed and that the guards discriminate him because 
of his condition (e.g. not allowing him to receive visits).  
</p>
<p>107. <b>Camjai Konothavorn</b>, aged 50, Thai citizen, was arrested on 20 August 1987 for drug 
offences. Soon afterwards he was sentenced to death, which was eventually commuted to life 
imprisonment. He was transferred from Cipinang to Pasir Putih in June 2007. Mr. Konothavorn 
did not voice any complaints and is satisfied with the conditions of detention, particularly in 
comparison to Cipinang prison. Mr. Konothavorn, who is fully repenting, has asked for a 
reduction of his sentence to 20 years. 
</p>
<p>108. <b>Adami Wilson</b>, aged 34, Nigerian citizen and Indonesian resident since 1991, was arrested 
in 2003 by officers of Polda Jakarta and charged under article 55 with drug related offences. 
During the interrogation, the officers blindfolded Mr. Wilson, put a gun into his mouth and </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/3/Add.7 
  page 47 
 
</p>
<p>threatened to kill him unless he confessed or paid the amount of 100 million IDR (about 
10,600 $US) for his release. Mr. Wilson eventually confessed and was sentenced to death 
in 2004. During the trial proceedings he informed the lawyer assigned to him about the 
ill-treatment he experienced. However, in his assessment the defence lawyer cooperated with the 
judge and the prosecutor in order to extract money from him. In 2005 Mr. Wilson tried to appeal 
the sentence. He did not receive any legal aid and the appeal was unsuccessful.  
</p>
<p>109. <b>Mr. Zulfiqaraw</b>, aged 40, from Lahore, Pakistan, was arrested at Jakarta Airport in 
November 2004 on allegations of drug related offences. While he was abroad the police raided 
his apartment in Jakarta which he shared with a friend who possessed drugs. Despite the friend&#8217;s 
confession and assurances that Mr. Zulfiqaraw was not involved in any drug related matter, the 
police took Mr. Zulfiqaraw from the airport to a private house, where he was tortured for three 
days. He was frequently punched, kicked and threatened with being shot unless he would 
confess. Nobody knew his whereabouts. After three days his health deteriorated so much that he 
had to be taken to the police hospital, where he was treated for 17 days. Subsequently, he was 
transferred to Polda Jakarta where he spent two and a half months in official police custody. The 
prosecutor in charge, Mr. Hutagaol, offered to drop any charges for a payment of 400 million 
IDR (about 42,700 $US). Mr. Zulfiqaraw perceived his ensuing trial as strikingly unfair and 
biased against him since he is a foreigner. No convincing evidence was presented; during the 
trial session his judge fell asleep. He did not receive any legal aid although he was not able to 
finance a lawyer; his embassy was wrongly informed and failed to support him. He was 
sentenced to death. In March 2005 he was transferred to Tangerang prison, and a few months 
prior to the interview he was moved to Pasir Putih.  
</p>
<p>110. <b>Gurdip Singh</b>, aged 38, from India, was sentenced to death in relation to the 
above-mentioned case. He was the flatmate of Mr. Zulfiqaraw and confirmed that 
Mr. Zulfiqaraw was not involved in any drug related matter; however, his statement was not 
taken into account during the trial proceedings. 
</p>
<p>111. <b>Mansyur Hamada</b>, aged 72, was arrested by officers of Polda Jakarta in January 2004 
for possessing 100 grammes of heroin. He was offered to be freed for the payment 
of 25 million IDR (2,670 $US) but did not have enough money. During his custody at Polda 
Jakarta he was beaten up for three days. His hands were cuffed behind his back and the officers 
beat him with their fists as well as with their shoes until he could not see any more. 40 days later, 
Mr. Hamada suffered a heart attack. In March 2004 Mr. Hamada was transferred to Cipinang 
prison, and in July 2004 he was sentenced to capital punishment. During the trial, Mr. Hamada 
stated that he was tortured; however, neither the judge nor the prosecutor took note of his 
allegations. A few months prior to the interview he was transferred to Pasir Putih. When the 
Special Rapporteur visited the prison, Mr. Hamada was suffering from glaucoma. During the 
debriefing, the prison director informed the Special Rapporteur that an operation had been 
scheduled for the next days. 
</p>
<p>112. <b>Indra Tamang</b>, aged 27, from Nepal, was sentenced to death in 2001 for drug related 
offences. In 2002 he appealed unsuccessfully against the verdict. He perceived his trial as unfair 
since he did not speak Indonesian sufficiently well in order to understand the court documents 
and did not have a lawyer.  </p>

<p>113. <b>Abdul Hafeez,</b> aged 37, from Pakistan, was arrested in 2001 and sentenced to death 
in 2002 for drug related offences. During police custody he was ill-treated. The prosecutor, 
Mr. Ferry-Silalaht, offered to free him for the payment of 300 million IDR (about 32,000 $US), 
which he could not afford.  
</p>
<p>114. <b>Ahmad Yani</b>, aged 33, and <b>Mr. Munzir</b>, aged 36, from Aceh Besar, complained to the 
Special Rapporteur that the location and isolation of Pasir Putih made it virtually impossible to 
receive any visitors and that they therefore would like to be transferred to a prison in Aceh. 
</p>
<p><b>YOGYAKARTA PRISON (JAVA)</b> 
(Visited on 21 November 2007) 
</p>
<p>115. On the day of the visit of the Special Rapporteur, the facility had a prison population 
of 401 of which 269 convicted (251 male, 18 female) and 132 pre-trial (127 male, 5 female) 
detainees. Furthermore, there were eight children in the prison. 147 of the detainees were 
imprisoned in relation to drug related crimes. There were 225 staff members. The Special 
Rapporteur was received by the prison director and the head of prison security, Agus Suryaaman.  
</p>
<p>116. The women&#8217;s wing is composed of three big cells (pre-trial detainees, detainees charged 
with drug trafficking, convicted prisoners). The women are allowed to go to hospital for medical 
treatment. The visiting hours are restricted to 15 minutes twice a week. 
</p>
<p>117. The minors&#8217; section is located in bloc A 4, which also contains punishment cells (A 3), 
cells for adult criminals (A 2) and terrorists (A 1). Most children say they were beaten up by the 
police and again upon arrival at the prison, where they were forced to do humiliating squatting 
and similar exercises in front of others. 
</p>
<p>118. Conversations with the management confirm that prison officials send detainees back to 
the police if they carry marks of torture or ill-treatment. According to the officials, about three 
detainees a year arrive from the police with bullet wounds; every two months a detainee with 
serious injuries is transferred from the police to the prison. A doctor is present at the prison every 
day during office hours; a nurse is available for 24 hours. Every new arrival goes through a 
medical check. 
</p>
<p>119. The so-called &#8220;orientation programme&#8221; for new arrivals means that they are detained in the 
quarantine for at least one week. Corporal punishment appears to be a routine practice in this 
prison. The prison authorities admit that it is conducted from time to time. In accordance with 
detainees&#8217; indications, the Special Rapporteur found instruments used for the ill-treatment in the 
office of KaKPLP (Head of prison security) where the beatings allegedly take place. The officer 
Widodo is named as one of the main perpetrators. Agus Suryaman, head of prison security, 
informed the Special Rapporteur that the sticks were seized from detainees and kept so that they 
would not be able to use them. However, the majority of allegations concerned ill-treatment by 
police forces during arrest, interrogation or custody. 
</p>
<p>120. <b>Detainee</b>, aged 19, accused of raping a girl, was put into an adult cell with the aim of 
having him tortured by his cellmates by the police at POLTABES Yogyakarta. The co-detainees 
burned cigarettes and hot plastic on his skin, leaving visible marks. They also put a burning 
substance on his penis, and forced him to eat chilli.  </p>

</p>
<p>121. <b>Eko,</b> aged 28, law student from Blora, Central Java, was arrested by six police officers at 
his home on 23 December 2006 based on the order of the head of the drug unit of Polres Sleman. 
He was kicked and punched by the officers and then taken to the Polres where he was 
interrogated in the office of Mr. Kurniawan. During interrogation he was electrocuted, got 
hammer blows on his fingers and was beaten by four police officers for one hour. The police 
officers also banged a chair on his body and put it on his toes. Following this treatment, he 
confessed, and Mr. Kurniawan offered him to drop some charges in exchange for money. He did 
not receive any medial treatment for his wounds and scars but the other detainees gave him some 
medicine. He was kept in Polres police custody for two months and then transferred to the prison 
LP Cebongan where he spent six months. At the Polres visitors had to pay 10 000 IDR (1 $US) 
to see him. The Prosecutor at the District Court offered mitigation in exchange of money. The 
Prosecutor was informed about the ill-treatment and the confession under torture, but this did not 
affect the outcome of the trial. In August 2007 he was transferred to the prison of Yogyakarta, 
which is much better than Cebongan, which is overcrowded; there is violence between prisoners 
and all detainees are intimidated.  
</p>
<p>122. <b>Bramantyo Dedy</b>, aged 29, from Magelang, Central Java, was arrested on the evening 
of 16 August 2005 in the border area between Yogyakarta and Magelang while he and a friend 
were driving home. At a traffic light, police officers stopped the car, dragged him out at gun 
point and put him on the floor. The police seized a few ecstasy pills which he had with him for 
his own consumption. Although he followed the orders of the officers, he was nevertheless shot 
three times from close range into his right foot by Officer Apeng. Furthermore his other foot was 
broken. The police&#8217;s explanation for the shooting was that Mr. Dedy tried to resist. He was taken 
to a hospital where he got some basic treatment for which he had to pay himself. He was 
constantly surveyed by the police in hospital. After three days, although not fully recovered, he 
was transferred to Polres Sleman where he was interrogated and put in an ordinary cell. The CID 
officer stepped on his feet again. After two months he was transferred to Cebongan. In July 2006 
he was transferred to the prison in Yogyakarta. In September 2006 he was sentenced to four 
years and three months of imprisonment. Since his lawyer invoked that he was subjected to 
torture he got a lighter sentence. 
</p>
<p>123. At the moment of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, Mr. Dedy was detained in the punishment 
cell A3-2. Prior to that he had been detained in the rehabilitation cell for sick prisoners, but four 
months earlier it had been discovered that he possessed a mobile phone and he was moved to the 
cell as a punishment. Subsequently he was beaten two times by Budi Pramono in the office of 
the Prison Security (KPLP). When he was beaten for the second time, another prison employee 
was in the room continuing his typing work. The first time he received three or four strokes with 
a rattan stick, the second time he was hit six times. According to Mr. Dedy the beating of 
detainees for breaking the prison rules is a common practice and frequently implemented.  
</p>
<p><b>POLTABES YOGYAKARTA (JAVA) 
</b>(Visited on 21 November 2007) 
</p>
<p>124. POLTABES Yogyakarta is the police headquarters of the city of Yogyakarta and 
comprises eight cells (approx. 2,5m x 4 m) grouped around a courtyard. The detention facilities 
are located in a separate building and guarded by members of the SAMAPTA unit. When the 
Special Rapporteur arrived, there were 48 detainees held there. The Special Rapporteur was not </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.7 
page 50 
 
</p>
<p>granted access to the cells for a prolonged time. The officers in charge of the cells were among 
others, officers Agung, Albert, Isrowiyah, Familiasyrah, Amin Kashrtadi and A. Prasetyo. Even 
during his interviews, he could not speak to the detainees without being watched by police 
officers. The atmosphere was extremely hostile.  
</p>
<p>125. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern the palpable level of fear among the detainees 
and their reluctance to speak with him. At least three detainees had clearly visible traces of 
beatings with bruises all over their bodies, on their heads, bloodshot eyes and deep eye sockets. 
Two others had sustained wounds on their legs from shots at close range. Although the Special 
Rapporteur repeatedly explained that, in accordance with his terms of reference, he was 
authorized to conduct interviews in private, the officers present observed him during interviews 
and repeatedly entered the yard where he was speaking to detainees (Officers Rizky Tri and 
Ngadino).  
</p>
<p>126. Several of the detainees indicated that the food was insufficient and of bad quality. 
</p>
<p>127. On his way to the debriefing meeting with the authorities, the Special Rapporteur found 
<b>Mr. Zulfikar</b>, aged 20, accused of a drug related crime, who had just been tortured in office 
No. 50. He had been beaten with a stick and a white plastic pipe by four police officers named 
Briptu Arika (Reskrim); Briptu Safari S.Y. (SAT NARKOBA); Briptu Agmeg Jatmiko 
(SAT NARKOBA); and Briptu Opar S. (SAT NARKOBA), which left very clear and 
distinguishable marks on his arm. The Head of the Narcotics Unit (Andri Triasfoetra, SIK) tried 
to deny the Special Rapporteur access, arguing that his mandate does not cover persons outside 
detention places (i.e. under interrogation).  
</p>
<p>128. The findings of the forensic expert (who recorded the evidence) as well as Mr. Zulfikar&#8217;s 
girlfriend, whom the Special Rapporteur interviewed, confirmed that Mr. Zulfikar had been 
tortured. She had been arrested together with him and put in the room next to the office where 
Mr. Zulfikar was ill-treated. She reported that she had heard his screams. She was extremely 
afraid of the police officers and cried repeatedly when interviewed by the Special Rapporteur. 
Although Mr. Zulfikar and his girlfriend were both extremely afraid of reprisals for speaking 
with the Special Rapporteur and begged for protection, the request of the Special Rapporteur to 
release them was not complied with. However the Special Rapporteur received the assurances of 
H. Zainal Arifin (Komisaris Polisi) that there would be no repercussions for any of the detainees 
interviewed by the Special Rapporteur.  
</p>
<p>129. The Special Rapporteur recommends that independent investigations of all those 
responsible for the torture of Mr. Zulfikar and other detainees be carried out in order to bring 
those responsible to justice (i.e. the alleged perpetrators and those senior officers who were 
under a duty to investigate as soon as there were reasonable grounds to believe that acts of 
torture had been committed). 
</p>
<p><b>CIPINANG PRISON JAKARTA 
</b>(Visited on 22 November 2007)<b> 
</b></p>
<p>130. Cipinang prison is the biggest detention facility in Indonesia. When visited by the Special 
Rapporteur there were 1,358 convicted prisoners, 2,087 pre-trial detainees and 14 detainees on </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/3/Add.7 
  page 51 
 
</p>
<p>day release. With a total of 3,459 detainees, the prison, which has a capacity for 1,500, is 
severely overcrowded. Besides the administration building, the facility comprises three separate, 
rather new detention buildings as well as a part retained from the former prison building. 
</p>
<p>131. The Special Rapporteur was particularly concerned by the 14 punishment cells. In these 
cells, which originally had been designed for one person, five detainees were held. Due to the 
lack of space detainees could not sleep at the same time. In order to remedy this situation 
hammocks were used.  
</p>
<p>132. The cells were very hot and humid. The only source of light was a little window, leaving 
the main part of the cell in the dark. Despite the information received from prison officials that 
detention in punishment cells would not exceed 14 days, the Special Rapporteur found that most 
detainees had spent several months there. He considers detention in these punishment cells as 
inhuman and urged the authorities to tackle this issue without any delay. Furthermore, he 
received credible allegations of beatings as a means of punishment, which was mainly inflicted 
by the prison wardens with rattan sticks in the KPLP office. These allegations were corroborated 
by forensic medical evidence.  
</p>
<p>133. The new arrivals were detained in Block C. While those few new arrivals affluent enough 
to pay bribes were transferred directly to a cell, the vast majority of detainees had to spend 
several months in a hall, similar to a sports hall, also called &#8220;Aula&#8221;. In those halls, amidst 
approximately 300 other detainees, the detainees not only lacked any privacy, but also had to 
sleep on the floor, or on a mattress (provided by the detainees themselves), and were exposed to 
a high risk of inter-prisoner violence.  
</p>
<p>134. Before his visit the Special Rapporteur had received numerous allegations regarding 
endemic corruption in Cipinang Prison. His interviews with detainees in Cipinang confirmed 
these allegations. Money has to be handed over for virtually every basic amenity, particularly for 
the provision of food, proper medical care, cell space and visits. The pervasiveness of corruption 
was tellingly summarized by one detainee, who described Cipinang as being a company, rather 
than a State prison.  
</p>
<p>135. <b>Hendra Apriyanda</b>, aged 33, was arrested on 9 August 2007 by the police in 
South Jakarta and taken to Polsek Tebet where he was interrogated. During the interrogation, 
which took place in the evening, he was beaten with fists and electrocuted until he confessed. 
Two months later he was transferred to Cipinang Prison. Together with 300 persons, he had 
spent almost two months in the &#8220;Aula&#8221; hall. He informed the Special Rapporteur about instances 
of corruption and its effects, inter alia facilitating the transfer to better places or cells at an earlier 
stage. Money also spared detainees from spending time in punishment cells.  
</p>
<p>136. <b>Bruno Danny</b>, aged 28, from Nigeria, detained in Linkugam Wing 2a. He lived in a kind 
of luxury flat and was to be released soon. He had been arrested in 2001 by the police in 
Hotel Meteng 2. After the arrest he was shot in the leg and then taken to the hospital for basic 
treatment. He spent two months at the Polres Central 71 and was then transferred to LP Salemba 
where he was detained for eight months. Convicted for drug dealing, he was sent to the 
Tangerang prison for six months and was eventually returned to Cipinang II in 2004, where he 
stayed until his recent transfer to Cipinang I. He reported ill-treatment in Cipinang II. </p>

</p>
<p>137. <b>Saka,</b> aged 55, was convicted for murder, but his death sentence was commuted to life 
imprisonment (upon recommendation of Komnas Ham). He has been detained in 
Cipinang Prison for 13 years. After his arrest, he had been severely beaten by the police at 
Polsek Riau in Sumatra. He further said that his confession, which was used during the trial, was 
obtained by ill-treatment. He had a lawyer, but had been unable to speak to him. He told the 
court that the confession had been made following ill-treatment; however this assertion was not 
taken into consideration. He had not seen his family again and was not in contact with them. The 
Special Rapporteur recommends his early release.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>138. <b>Janus</b>, aged 63, from South Sulawesi was arrested on 9 June 2007 in South Jakarta district. 
During the first three days in custody at Polres South Jakarta, he was interrogated for several 
hours and repeatedly beaten in order to make him sign a confession. Among others, Mr. Janus 
was hit with an iron bar and a wooden baton. At one point an officer beat him with the sole of his 
sandal on his ear, causing it to bleed. He was not informed about the possibility to contact a 
lawyer or to receive legal aid. The protocol of the interrogation, typed by an officer called 
&#8220;Aris&#8221;, stated that he was arrested on 12 June, excluding the first two days during which he was 
ill-treated. On 4 August 2007 he was transferred to Cipinang prison where he had been detained 
in the area for new arrivals, Block C2, also called Aula until the day of the visit. Mr. Janus 
complained about the rampant corruption in the prison. While those without money had to sleep 
on the floor in the Aula, detainees with money received a cell on the upper floors, which &#8220;cost&#8221; 
200,000 IDR (about 21 $US) to be paid to the &#8220;Palkam&#8221;, another detainee, who acts as the 
&#8220;unofficial head of security&#8221; and the prolonged arm of the prison authorities. In Mr. Janus 
opinion, approximately 35 per cent of all detainees on the ground floor of the Aula do not have 
mattresses to sleep on.  
</p>
<p>139. <b>Suhenry</b>, aged 34, from Aceh, was arrested by five officers of Polres South Jakarta 
District in November 2006 in connection with a drug related crime. In the course of the first 
three days he was repeatedly interrogated by two officers in an ordinary office room on the 
second floor with the aim of identifying his supplier. When Mr. Suhenry refused to indicate his 
name they pressed his hand on the desk and beat his palm and fingers with a hammer. 
Furthermore, they used electroshock devices to electrocute him and punched him all over the 
body. At one point, the officers offered to let him escape, however, Mr. Suhenry stayed since he 
believed that this was a trick in order to shoot him during what would be later presented as an 
attempt to flee. The officers also put a plastic bag over his head, but Mr. Suhenry managed to 
bite a hole in it enabling him to breath. Eventually, Mr. Suhenry confessed in order to end the 
torture. After his interrogation, Mr. Suhenry spent two months in a cell with other detainees. He 
met the prosecutor once for two hours. From Polres he was subsequently transferred to Cipinang, 
where he spent 20 days in the Aula.  
</p>
<p><b>POLRES JAKARTA EAST (METROPOLITAN JAKARTA TIMUR)</b> 
(Visited on 22 November 2007) 
</p>
<p>140. The Special Rapporteur was received by Mr. Jackson (Officer in charge), Mr. Kabag, 
Ms Dedeh. The officers on duty and in charge of the cells were Mr. Abdul Mukti (AIPTU), 
Mr. Syafarindun, AIPDA, Ms. I. Made (Brigadir), Y. Jako and Y. Yasin. The detention facilities 
were located on the fifth floor and consisted of ten relatively clean cells (about 5m x 3m), where 
45 drug related and 28 ordinary criminal suspects were held. There was general reluctance to 
speak with the Special Rapporteur among the detainees. Those who dared to do so requested </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/3/Add.7 
  page 53 
 
</p>
<p>confidentiality. It became clear that the majority of the detainees had been subjected to beatings 
during their interrogations, which allegedly took place outside the police station in non-official 
facilities. The detainees held in relation with drug crimes indicated that the aim of these beatings 
was to find out their dealers&#8217; names. There were at least three detainees with clearly visible 
traces of very recent beatings, which were corroborated by medical evidence. In one cell the 
Special Rapporteur found a sleeping juvenile, who had been brought to the cell only a few hours 
earlier, and whose face was completely swollen. Most of the detainees had been in custody for 
several weeks. According to the police registration blackboards, the person longest in detention 
had been there for 75 days. 
</p>
<p>141. After having inspected the cells, the Special Rapporteur ran into <b>Mohammed Tasroni</b>, 
aged 17, from Jakarta, who was handcuffed to a chair in an office belonging to the drug unit on 
the fourth floor. Mr. Tasroni was in the process of being interrogated by Mr. Sudartianta 
(No. 65080313) and had very strong swellings on this face as well as other traces of recent 
beatings all over his body. 
</p>
<p>142. Mr. Tasroni reported that he had been arrested a few hours earlier near the Jatinegara Train 
Station, East Jakarta. There, he had met an old acquaintance whom he had not seen for a very 
long time and who asked to provide him with a dose of marijuana. After Mr. Tasroni had 
arranged for the drugs and handed them over to the former, it turned out that he was actually an 
undercover police officer working for the pursuit and attack team (&#8220;Buser&#8221;) of the Criminal 
Investigation Department. Mr. Tasroni was arrested by several plain-clothes police officers and 
taken to a private house, which appeared to be an empty office building, in a civilian Kijang car. 
Once in the house, the officers started to punch and kick Mr. Tasroni all over his body and on his 
face. He was also heavily beaten on his back. Mr. Tasroni was told the beating would not stop 
unless he would reveal the identity of his drug dealer. The beating was inflicted in the presence 
and with the participation of Mr. Bambang (AKP), the chief of Unit III/Baya of the Narcotics 
Unit. Mr. Tasroni&#8217;s allegations were corroborated by evidence taken by the forensic expert 
accompanying the Special Rapporteur.  
</p>
<p>143. After the beating, Mr. Tasroni was taken to POLRES East Jakarta and handed over to 
Mr. Sudartianta, who further interrogated him. 
</p>
<p>144. When the Special Rapporteur entered the office room, Mr. Sudartianta initially attempted 
to deny him access to the room, trying to intimidate Mr. Tasroni and claiming that the injuries 
were inflicted by a mob. Mr. Tasroni was so afraid that he himself claimed to be only a visitor - a 
statement that due to the fact that he was handcuffed was not credible. Neither Mr. Sudartianta, 
nor the other officers present, who were watching TV and continuing their office work, initiated 
an investigation into the physical condition of Mr. Tasroni. The police was not able to produce 
any arrest protocols or other documents relating to the case. The Special Rapporteur received 
information that Mr. Bambang (AKP) was a direct superior to Mr. Sudartianta.  
</p>
<p>145. Mr. Tasroni furthermore reported that he had been arrested several weeks before, but his 
parents had been able to secure his release by paying 5 million IDR (about 535 $US).  
</p>
<p>146. The Special Rapporteur recommends that independent investigations into the torture of 
Mr. Tasroni and other detainees be carried out and that those responsible for those acts be </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.7 
page 54 
 
</p>
<p>brought to justice (i.e. the alleged perpetrators and those senior officers who are under the duty 
to investigate as soon as there are reasonable grounds to believe that acts of torture had been 
committed). 
</p>
<p><b>POLRES JAKARTA SOUTH (METROPOLITAN JAKARTA SELATAN)</b> 
(Visited on 22 November 2007) 
</p>
<p>147. The facility is the police&#8217;s headquarters for South Jakarta, an area with about two million 
inhabitants. The Special Rapporteur was received by the Deputy Head of the Criminal 
Investigation Branch, Mr. Mulyatno SH.MM, AKBP. Individuals in custody were held in 
12 cells (6m x3 m each) on an upper floor of the main building. Upon arrival of the Special 
Rapporteur, there were 101 detainees. Among them were 10 women who were detained in a 
separate cell. Another cell was used by only three individuals alleged to have violated 
anti-corruption provisions. Those detainees had been able to bring many of their belongings into 
the cell and were therefore able to enjoy a comparably well-furnished room. 
</p><p>148. The Special Rapporteur regrets that although he explained that under his terms of reference 
he was authorized to conduct interviews confidentially, a few officers repeatedly looked into the 
cell wing. Nevertheless, he received credible information on a confidential basis that torture and 
other forms of ill-treatment were routinely practiced during arrest and detention at Polres South 
Jakarta. Detainees reported beatings, including with iron sticks, particularly during 
interrogations.  
</p>
<p>149. A number of persons reported that they had been in custody for more than 40 days (the 
longest since 1 October 2007). Furthermore, according to the registration blackboard of the cell 
for individuals charged with corruption, these detainees had been in the cell since 
December 2006. The Special Rapporteur received many complaints by detainees about the 
quality and quantity of food. Drinking water was not provided by the police but had to be bought 
in containers by the detainees themselves. Furthermore, detainees were obliged to pay about 
100 $US a week as &#8220;rent&#8221; for their cell. Those who were not able to pay their share were 
dependent on contributions by fellow detainees. The Special Rapporteur was assured by the 
officials that medical services were in principle available. However, at least one detainee with 
untreated torture wounds was clearly in need of expeditious intervention by a doctor. Detainees 
were allowed to receive visitors only against payment. All of the women had children, and were 
able to receive visits twice a week. One woman had a baby of 15 months, but preferred not to 
have it with her in custody.  
</p>
<p>150. Mr. Mulyatno Deputy, Head of Polres, informed the Special Rapporteur about one case of 
beating by an officer during interrogation. The officer was reportedly sanctioned with seven days 
of disciplinary detention. After having left the detention wing, the Special Rapporteur found 
coincidentally another room, resembling more a dirty recreation room with a pool table for the 
staff than a cell, in which eight persons, including two women, were being held. The person 
longest detained had been in the room for four days. Although nobody complained about 
physical ill-treatment, the detainees voiced their dissatisfaction with the conditions of their 
detention. There were no beds and detainees had to sleep on the floor or on one of the three 
benches. Men had to urinate in an adjoining room since they were not allowed to leave the cell if 
necessary. Hence, there was a strong malodour, exacerbated by the lack of ventilation.  </p>

<p><b>NOTE VERBALE 
</b></p>
<p>1. By note dated 14 February 2008, the Government requested that the following diplomatic 
note be incorporated as part of the annexed document of the final report of the Special 
Rapporteur on Torture.  
</p>
<p>2. By note verbal sent to the office of the United Nations Development Programme Indonesia 
on 16 November, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia, with reference to 
the visit by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, drew attention to &#8220;the inadequate 
proficiency in English of one of the interpreters who facilitated the visit&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>3. The Ministry requested &#8220;the Office that certified and professional interpreters be assigned 
to assist the UN Special Rapporteur in the discharge of his mandate in Indonesia&#8221;. The Ministry 
further informed the Office &#8220;that Indonesia is strongly committed to the Institutional Building 
process of the Human Rights Council, including the review of the Special Procedures of the 
Council. In this regard, Indonesia is of the view that the Experience in cooperating in good faith 
with a number of Special Rapporteurs should be shared with other member states as well as 
observer states of the Human Rights Council. It is hoped that such sharing will encourage 
countries in extending their cooperation to Special Rapporteurs in an effective and proper 
manner. It is in this context that Indonesia would like to see that the work of the Special 
Procedures be strengthened and made more relevant to situations on the ground.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>4. The Ministry also informed the Office &#8220;that it will later request the Secretariat of the 
Human Rights Council to include this note among the Council&#8217;s official documents.&#8221;
