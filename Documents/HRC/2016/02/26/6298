<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> At the invitation of the Government, the Working Group visited Peru from 29 January to 
2 February 2007. The Working Group thanks the Peruvian authorities for their cooperation and 
the constructive dialogue that ensued during consultations. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group commends Peru for its accession to the International Convention 
against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries, and on the drafting of a 
bill by Congress prohibiting Peruvians from providing security services in armed conflict zones. 
It recognizes the efforts made by the Government to regulate private security companies through 
the adoption in 2006 of Act No. 28879, for which implementing regulations are in preparation, 
as well as Act No. 28806 (Labour Inspection Act) and Act No. 28950, on the Prevention of 
Trafficking in Persons and the Smuggling of Migrants. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group continues to be concerned at the recruitment of Peruvians by Peruvian 
and American companies, subcontracted in turn by MVM Inc. (based in California) and 
Triple Canopy (based in Illinois), and at the situation they face in Afghanistan and Iraq in 
fulfilling contracts for the United States Department of State. American private security 
companies have concluded contracts that would appear to include mercenary-related activities 
such as the recruitment, training, financing and use of persons for commercial gain. There appear 
to have been contractual irregularities, very harsh working conditions, excessive working hours, 
non-payment of salaries, ill-treatment and isolation, neglect of basic needs, lack of medical 
attention, as well as the deaths in tragic circumstances of at least two Peruvians. The Working 
Group notes shortcomings on Peru&#8217;s part, such as the training of nationals in Peruvian military 
installations, irregularities and a lack of protection in employment contracts for Iraq. The 
absence of national legislation, regulation and appropriate monitoring in Peru has created a legal 
vacuum that benefits private security companies operating in the international market and 
encourages them to seek to recruit nationals of other countries as security guards in armed 
conflict zones. The Working Group is concerned at the intimidation of the population of the 
region of Cajamarca, and notably the defenders of economic, social and environmental rights, by 
private security groups or police engaged in private security work. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group recommends the strengthening of the normative framework. The 
authorities should keep transparent registers of private security companies covering all matters 
relating to ownership, statutes, purposes and functions, as well as a system of regular 
inspections. It also recommends the adoption of legislation and regulations to prevent any 
conflicts of interest when serving State officials act as owners or managers of such companies. It 
recommends that the competent authorities, in particular the Attorney-General&#8217;s Office, should 
investigate all cases that have not been resolved, especially the deaths of Peruvian nationals in 
Afghanistan and Iraq. It urges the authorities to continue to provide community leaders in the 
Cajamarca region with the precautionary protection measures that were requested by the 
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.  </p>

</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Working Group, represented by its then 
Chairperson, Ms. Amada Benavides de P&#233;rez, and one of its members, Mr. Jos&#233; Luis 
G&#243;mez del Prado, visited Peru from 29 January to 2 February 2007.   
</p>
<p>2. The purpose of the visit was to obtain information in order to fulfil its mandate to study 
and identify emerging issues, manifestations and trends regarding mercenaries or 
mercenary-related activities, and the functioning of private military and security companies 
(PMSCs) and their impact on human rights.<b>1</b> The visit to Peru forms part of a regional 
assessment by the Working Group on the trend towards the privatization of security in 
Latin America, including the phenomenon observed in recent years where nationals of countries 
in the region have been recruited by PMSCs.<b>2</b> Many of these companies are subsidiaries of 
foreign-based companies, which operate in armed conflict situations such as Iraq and 
Afghanistan. 
</p>
<p>3. The following areas were dealt with: (a) the recruitment and military training of Peruvians 
by private security companies to provide services in Iraq; (b) the activities, operations, 
functioning and oversight of private security companies in Peru; (c) involvement in social 
conflicts of some private security companies providing protection services to transnational 
natural resource extraction companies; and (d) Peru&#8217;s accession to the International Convention 
against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries. 
</p>
<p>4. The Working Group held meetings with State legislative, executive, judicial and other 
organs. It met with ministers, deputy ministers, and senior officials at the Ministries of Foreign 
Affairs, Defence, the Interior and the Police, Justice and Labour; the chairpersons of the Justice 
and Human Rights Commission and the Labour Commission of the National Congress; the 
President of the Supreme Court of Justice, the Senior Prosecutor of the Higher National General 
Criminal Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, the National Director of the Institute of Forensic Medicine and the 
Ombudsman&#8217;s Office. It also met with other sectors of Peruvian civil society, including 
representatives of the Bar Association, a significant number of non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs), private security companies, individuals and the media. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  GENERAL COMMENTS 
</b></p>
<p>5. Part of the mandate of the Working Group is to monitor and study the effects of the 
activities of PMSCs on all human beings.<b>3</b> With the privatization of security functions 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  The Working Group considers private military and security companies as being companies 
</p>
<p>providing all kinds of assistance, security, training, provision and consulting services, from 
unarmed logistical support to the provision of armed guards involved in defensive or offensive 
military operations. 
<b>2
</b>  The Working Group has requested invitations to visit Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Honduras and 
</p>
<p>Peru (E/CN.4/2006/11/Add.1, para. 23).

</p>
<p>traditionally performed by the army or the police, the line between public and private is 
becoming blurred, creating a dangerous confusion, a &#8220;grey area&#8221;, between State public services 
and services provided by private commercial entities. As indicated in the Working Group&#8217;s 
reports,<b>4</b> under international law<b>5</b> and domestic law, States have the primary responsibility in 
maintaining public security, law and order.  
</p>
<p>6. A cause for concern is the trend towards privatization of security and the use of force and 
the fact that human rights violations are being committed with impunity when PMSCs operate in 
armed conflicts, in the control of national security or in other situations. This phenomenon is 
often associated with the creation by transnational companies of satellite subsidiaries with legal 
personality in one country, providing services in another country and recruiting personnel from 
third countries. 
</p>
<p>7. Another new development is that some of those companies, or their employees, commit 
offences against personal freedom, coercing, harassing and threatening members of human rights 
organizations in the context of social protests, in particular defenders of economic, social and 
environmental rights. 
</p>
<p>8. It is essential to establish and strengthen national oversight and control, creating 
registration and licensing systems for PMSCs and their employees. Such regulation should 
include minimum requirements for transparency and company accountability, screening 
and vetting of personnel, and as well as a monitoring system with parliamentary oversight.  
</p>
<p><b>II. POLITICAL AND LEGAL STRATEGY AND  
INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  International level 
</b></p>
<p>9. Peru is a State party to all seven major international human rights instruments. It has 
agreed to the mechanisms to examine individual complaints under the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights; the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination; the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women; and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment. It has ratified the two Optional Protocols to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p>10. The 1993 Constitution stipulates that international treaties form an integral part of national 
legislation and that rights and freedoms shall be interpreted in conformity with the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and with any international human rights treaty ratified by Peru. 
</p>

</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  A/61/341, paras. 75-76, and A/HRC/4/42, paras. 36-59. 
</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  See the preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Committee&#8217;s general comment No. 21 on the humane treatment of persons deprived of their 
liberty. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/7/Add.2

</p>
<p><b>B.  National level 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Labour Minister noted that Act No. 28806 (Labour Inspection Act) and Act No. 28950 
on the Prevention of Trafficking in Persons and the Smuggling of Migrants strengthen police 
power to inspect employment agencies and monitor trafficking in persons. The new legislation 
also allows mining and construction companies to be inspected without the prior authorization of 
the Ministry of Energy and Mining. She said that any deficiencies in the employment register for 
private security companies would be rectified by the new electronic system. The new laws 
reinforce the principle of &#8220;shared responsibility&#8221;, under which the parent company is held legally 
liable should a subcontractor not fulfil its obligations. The Working Group emphasizes that the 
State is responsible for granting licences and for oversight and control of both parent companies 
and their subsidiaries. 
</p>
<p>12. Under Act No. 28879 of 2006, the Ministry of the Interior, through the Office for 
Oversight of Security Services, Arms, Munitions and Explosives for Civilian Use 
(DICSCAMEC), is responsible for the regulation, control and oversight of private security 
services. The Minister and the Director of DICSCAMEC informed the Working Group that 
regulations had already been drafted for the implementation of the Private Security Services Act 
which will strengthen the Ministry&#8217;s powers, but that they had yet to be finalized. Private 
security activities are aimed at safeguarding and protecting the life and physical integrity of 
persons and providing security for the assets of natural and legal persons. Private security 
companies are prohibited from providing services that put national security at risk; performing 
functions that properly fall to the armed forces or national police; and hiring, preparing and 
training mercenaries. There are some 50,000 private guards and probably another 50,000 in the 
informal sector. Many of the informal companies provide security to municipalities. They 
explained the requirements for registering a private security company. Only some private 
security companies were registered. The training of Peruvians for Afghanistan and Iraq had been 
carried out before the Act was passed.  
</p>
<p><b>III.  PRIVATE SECURITY COMPANIES IN PERU 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Recruitment and military training of Peruvians 
by private security companies to provide security 
services in Afghanistan and Iraq 
</b></p>
<p>13. Since mid-2005, intermediary companies have been selecting Peruvians for two American 
private security companies, Triple Canopy<b>6</b> and MVM Inc.,<b>7</b> which were tasked with recruiting, 
training and sending them to the armed conflict zones of Iraq and Afghanistan. The exact 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  Triple Canopy comprises bankers, high-ranking American military personnel, technical experts 
</p>
<p>and consultants. It specializes in the protection of top executives, buildings and convoys. This 
company recruited Peruvians for Iraq but has also hired Chileans and Hondurans for the same 
purpose.  
<b>7
</b>  See Isabel Ord&#243;&#241;ez&#8217;s article, &#8220;Iraq, Afghanistan lure poor Latin American guards&#8221;, Reuters, 
</p>
<p>  A/HRC/7/7/Add.2 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>number of Peruvians hired over approximately a year and a half is not known. Figures collated 
from various sources indicated that there were around 1,100 Peruvians in Iraq: 850 in Baghdad 
and 300 in Basra. MVM Inc. hired Peruvians for Afghanistan and Triple Canopy for Iraq. 
</p>
<p>14. MVM Inc. is an American company registered under Californian law. After winning a 
United States Government contract, it specialized in recruiting Peruvians to provide security 
services in Afghanistan. The selection process was contracted to 3D Global Solutions and was in 
turn subcontracted to an intermediary agency, G4S Wackenhut Peru. Following the death by 
hanging of Mart&#237;n A. Jara Hichard at the American air base at Bagharam, Kabul, in as yet 
unexplained circumstances, MVM decided in December 2005 to cancel the contracts and send 
the 250 Peruvians working in Afghanistan back to Peru. 
</p>
<p>15. Triple Canopy is an American company registered in Illinois, with headquarters in 
Virginia, and describes itself as a client of the United States Government. After winning a 
contract with the Department of State in Iraq, Triple Canopy reportedly subcontracted the 
services of 3D Global Solutions<b>8</b> to select personnel. In its turn, 3D Global Solutions 
subcontracted Gesegur SAC, Gun Supply SA, G4S Wackenhut Peru SA and Defion 
Internacional SA. The Peruvian authorities made available information supplied by Defion 
Internacional stating that, in order to be finally recruited as &#8220;independent contractors&#8221; by Triple 
Canopy, those selected had to have military training to ensure they could defend themselves, and 
that this was stipulated as a requirement in a clause of the Defense Base Act insurance policy 
issued by the United States Department of State. 
</p>
<p>16. The brief given to candidates by all employment agencies was that they were going to 
work in Baghdad&#8217;s &#8220;Green Zone&#8221;<b>9</b> to protect the United States Embassy or private facilities in 
that country. However, the Working Group has received a copy of a complaint for breach of 
contract brought by five Peruvian guards hired by 3D Global Solutions<b>10</b> and who worked in 
Baghdad&#8217;s &#8220;Red Zone&#8221; for EOD Technology Inc., despite having been hired to work in the 
Green Zone.  
</p>
<p>17. None of the contracts signed by the Peruvians were submitted to the Ministry of Labour 
and Promotion of Employment as, since they were not going to be performed in Peru, they were 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>8
</b>  3D Global Solutions, based in the United States of America, selects personnel with military 
</p>
<p>experience for security work. Its directors are professionals with military and corporate 
experience. 
<b>9
</b>  Private security companies admit that the Green Zone is a highly dangerous armed conflict 
</p>
<p>zone where there is a risk of death. On 25 November 2004, four Nepalese security employees 
died in an attack on the Green Zone, http://icasualities.org.oif/.  
<b>10
</b></p>
<p>  The 3D Global Solutions representative in Lima who had hired or selected them was 
apparently Ms. Isaura Marca and, in the United States, Mr. Michael Dodd. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/7/Add.2

</p>
<p>not considered subject to Peruvian legislation. The Ministry of Labour said that it was only 
empowered to monitor work carried out in Peru, not abroad, even when Peruvian workers were 
involved.<b>11</b> The Ministry does not have a register of the companies that act as intermediaries for 
private security companies. 
</p>
<p>18. According to an executive of Defion Internacional, which operated in Peru for Triple 
Canopy, the contract of the &#8220;independent contractors&#8221; was with the United States Government. 
Mr. Mark Dewitt of Triple Canopy<b>12</b> stated that, in the case of the death of a Peruvian in Iraq, 
any insurance claim had to be lodged with the United States Department of State. The 
employment contract covered the insurance indirectly, provided the contracted person was in 
Baghdad&#8217;s Green Zone.<b>13</b> In the case of death or incapacity, the United States Labour 
Department is responsible for calculating the pension or total amount that the employee or their 
survivors should receive. 
</p>
<p>19. The Peruvian authorities have been in contact with the United States Department of State 
through the Peruvian Embassy in Washington, in order to establish the level of responsibility 
with respect to the physical safety and working conditions of the Peruvians in Afghanistan and 
Iraq. According to the Department of State, they were private contracts between the security 
companies and individuals, and similar contracts had been concluded in other countries, such as 
Chile and Colombia. It pointed out that the contractual conditions and place of recruitment and 
employment were internal decisions of Triple Canopy and did not require coordination with the 
United States Government. The Department of State suggested that the Peruvian Government 
should contact the headquarters of Triple Canopy directly.<b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>20. The degree of involvement of the companies that selected the Peruvians to work as 
&#8220;independent contractors&#8221; varies. Wackenhut del Per&#250; (registered as G4S Per&#250; S.A.),<b>15</b> carried 
out a single round of selection of 500 Peruvians for 3D Global Solutions USA, in Indiana, which 
in turn had been subcontracted by Triple Canopy. According to its directors, Wackenhut merely 
selected personnel, between October 2005 and January 2006, verified that they met certain

</b>  Act No. 27711 (Ministry of Labour and Promotion of Employment Act), Act No. 27626

<p>  According to information received, in January 2007, there were also Peruvians in Basra and 
not just in Baghdad, as well as Peruvians who had worked outside the Green Zone.

its parent company in the United States. This company provides security to the United States

had trained Peruvians in Huachipa.  </p>

<p>requirements and was paid for each selection.<b>16</b> The company could not supply information on 
how many of the 500 Peruvians selected were hired for Iraq; 3D Global Solutions had apparently 
been responsible for contacting applicants directly and assessing, training and hiring them. 
</p>
<p>21. Gesegur SAC (Peru) was contracted by 3D Global Solutions Inc. to select Peruvians on 
behalf of Triple Canopy. Despite repeated attempts, the Working Group did not manage to meet 
with Gesegur.<b>17</b> Defion Internacional acted as the sole representative of Triple Canopy in Peru, 
selecting Peruvians for Iraq and handling the logistical and administrative formalities for Triple 
Canopy (tickets, contracts, opening of bank accounts and airport transfers). Defion acted under 
the supervision of Triple Canopy as an intermediary company between the contracted persons 
and their families in Peru. Information supplied by that company<b>18</b> indicated that 1,130 Peruvians 
were providing services in Iraq for Triple Canopy Inc., and that 266 of them had been selected 
by Gesegur SAC and 864 by Defion Internacional. Defion said that two Peruvians had died and 
four had been injured.<b>19</b> 
22. G4S Wackenhut is listed on Peru&#8217;s registers as an intermediary services company, on the 
Ministry of the Interior&#8217;s DICSCAMEC<b>20</b> register as one of 1,578 private security companies 
and on the register of the National Public Records Oversight Agency. Neither Gun Supply, 
Gesegur SAC, Defion Internacional, 3D Global Solutions, Triple Canopy Inc. nor MVM Inc., the 
companies that selected or hired Peruvians to go to Afghanistan or Iraq, were  listed on the 
national register of companies and entities conducting labour intermediation activities in Peru, or 
on DICSCAMEC&#8217;s register. However, Defion Internacional SAC and Gesegur SAC were listed 
with the National Public Records Oversight Agency. There were also &#8220;ghost&#8221; companies, 
which rent premises, select personnel and then vanish. One such company is said to have hired 
200 Peruvians who reportedly left via Chile to work in Baghdad&#8217;s Red Zone.<b>21</b>

</b>  Information provided by the company, in an interview conducted on 2 February 2007. 
</p>
<p><b>17
</b>  Gesegur had aparently pre-selected some 400 persons in October 2005. Triple Canopy had 
</p>
<p>pointed out that Defion Internacional maintained a permanent relationship with Americos, the 
company said to be owned by Gesegur SAC. Information supplied by the Peruvian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs.

<p>  Letter from the Administrative Manager of Defion Internacional, dated 1 February 2007, to 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Peru. The Working Group met with executives from the 
company, among whom were Mr. Alejandro Fern&#225;ndez and Mr. Juan Manuel Dur&#225;n, the latter 
being an ex-employee of Triple Canopy with experience in Iraq and who had apparently worked 
in Chile and Honduras before coming to recruit in Peru. 
<b>19
</b></p>
<p>  According to other sources, Defion Internacional alone had sent some 1,200 Peruvians to Iraq; 
see the article &#8220;Iraq, Afghanistan lure poor Latin American guards&#8221; (note 7 above).

</p>
<p>23. Some Peruvians received military training at facilities belonging to Peru&#8217;s Army Arms and 
Ammunition Factory (FAME); others completed a theory course in Lima and military training in 
Amman, Jordan. A contract was concluded between Gun Supply SAC and FAME, under which 
FAME provided, for 500,000 nuevos soles, premises to house between 200 and 250 people, 
food, accommodation and 374,000 rounds of ammunition.<b>22</b> Gun Supply SAC trained the 
Peruvians to be recruited by Triple Canopy in FAME installations. At the request of a 
congressman, the Ministry of Defence conducted an investigation that revealed (a) that the 
Army had not evaluated the political and international implications when approving Triple 
Canopy Inc.&#8217;s proposal to use FAME premises to train Peruvians to serve the Government of the 
United States of America in its operations in Iraq; (b) that the Managing Director of FAME had 
contravened the law and the DICSCAMEC rules on the use of weapons of war and ammunition; 
(c) that Gun Supply SAC and the Higher Institute of Security and Applied Sciences, a private 
security company, had taught three courses to civilian students in FAME installations; and 
(d) that neither the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor the Ministry of Defence had been informed of 
the contract and its purpose.

<p>24. The results of the investigation and the sanctions imposed were sent to the Office of 
Provincial Criminal Prosecutor No. 4, specializing in official corruption. The Ministry of 
Defence has indicated that it is willing to provide all information required to ensure transparency 
and the protection and observance of the human rights of Peruvian nationals and that this type of 
situation will not occur in the future.

<p>25. Defion Internacional SAC, in addition to selecting Peruvians to go to Iraq, apparently 
provided them with 80 hours of theory classes and 40 hours of firearm instruction.

<p>26. The contracts concluded<b>23</b> by Peruvians with Triple Canopy Inc. pertain to activities 
relating to war operations in the context of the armed conflict in Afghanistan and Iraq.<b>24</b> 
</p>
<p>27. The contracts stipulate (a) that the &#8220;independent contractor&#8221; is not an employee of the 
company and is not entitled to any employment benefits or rights not specifically stipulated in 
the contract signed; (b) that the &#8220;independent contractor&#8221; shall provide a service in Iraq for a 
period of 12 months, at a daily rate of US$ 33 (as a simple guard); (c) that payment for such 
services shall be subject to three conditions: successful completion of training, the independent 
contractor&#8217;s availability to travel to the location of the mission, and security clearance for a 
moderate-risk position of public trust, or any other security clearance as may be applied by the

<p>Government of the United States. The company can terminate the contract at any time with 
immediate effect and without stating a reason, merely by notifying the &#8220;independent contractor&#8221; 
of its decision. 
</p>
<p>28. Article 7, on &#8220;Hazardous environment&#8221;, stipulates that &#8220;the independent contractor 
understands and recognizes that, in providing these services, he shall be exposed to many of the 
hazards of a high-risk environment, including but not limited to the extreme and unpredictable 
risks and hazards of war, and other more or less common risks. The independent contractor fully 
recognizes that the provision of services is intrinsically dangerous, and might result in death or 
personal injury to himself or other persons, or damage to personal property&#8221;. According to 
article 8, the independent contractor &#8220;voluntarily, freely, and knowingly accepts each and every 
risk known and unknown, in any way related to the general training, the provision of services or 
travel to and from, or residence in, each mission location.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>29. In article 12, the independent contractor accepts a disclaimer exonerating the company and 
the client and their corporate subsidiaries, executives, and so on, from liability even if the harm 
was caused or generated by the company. All clauses of the contract are legally binding on the 
independent contractor&#8217;s heirs. 
</p>
<p>30. Three of the clauses entail the renunciation of important rights. Article 14 on Applicable 
law and jurisdiction, stipulates that the contract shall be governed by the laws of the State of 
Virginia, United States of America. Article 15 states that the authentic text of the contract is the 
English version. Under the final clause, the independent contractor &#8220;renounces some of his legal 
rights&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>31. The contract constitutes an abuse of rights because it includes unfair clauses that are 
incompatible with the principles of legality and equality. It imposes inequalities and objective 
limitations on the independent contractor and compels him to renounce some of his rights, while 
the hiring party states that it has another contract with the Government of the United States. To 
define these people as security guards in an armed conflict zone could be interpreted as 
deception. The National Human Rights Coordinating Committee is of the view that the contracts 
contain a series of clauses that violate the country&#8217;s legal order, public policy and common 
decency. 
</p>
<p>32. As indicated above, there have been complaints of breach of contract from the Peruvians 
so hired. Five guards alleged that one of the companies had failed to pay them a portion of their 
wages and had forced them to work in Baghdad&#8217;s Red Zone. Other complainants described the 
lack of medical attention and overcrowding in barracks, working days of over 12 hours, with 
only 1 day off every 10 days worked, low-quality food, a feeling of constantly being watched, 
and being forced to tell their families that everything was fine. Many relatives have apparently 
not complained for fear of reprisals or of not receiving a bonus on completing the contract. 
</p>
<p>33. The most serious cases are those involving the deaths of Wilder F. Guti&#233;rrez L&#243;pez and 
Mart&#237;n Jara Hichard. Other deaths are said to have occurred, but relatives have apparently not 
reported them for fear of not being able to claim the insurance. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/7/Add.2 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>34. On 11 October 2005, Wilder F. Guti&#233;rrez L&#243;pez signed a contract with Triple Canopy to 
work in Iraq as a security guard, having obtained a certificate of attendance on the second 
international course of the Higher Institute of Security and Applied Sciences and Gesegur. The 
Solidarity Hospital issued a certificate of good health, which was forwarded to 3D Global 
Solutions so that he could work with Triple Canopy. In Baghdad, he was diagnosed with acute 
leukaemia, was returned to Lima and on 5 December 2005 was admitted to the National Institute 
of Neoplastic Diseases, where he died the following day. His widow accuses the security 
company of concealing her husband&#8217;s illness from her and allowing him to travel without 
medical assistance. His widow and relatives cannot comprehend how a person in good health 
could have developed acute leukaemia in such a short time, unless there were external factors, 
such as radioactive materials, in the place he was working. Moreover, because the contract is 
governed by the laws of the State of Virginia, his widow is now caught up in a maze of 
procedures to enforce the provisions of the insurance policy. 
</p>
<p>35. Mart&#237;n Jara Hichard, who died in circumstances which are still unclear, signed a one-year 
contract with MVM Inc. on 7 October 2005. On 2 December 2005, Worldwide Assistance 
informed his relatives that he had died that day in Kabul from unknown causes, and offered to 
repatriate his body, cremated or embalmed. The Director of the Institute of Forensic Medicine, of 
the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, decided that it was necessary to repatriate the body in its current 
state in order to establish the cause of death. Accordingly, the Provincial Criminal Prosecutor 
instructed the Secretary for Peruvian Communities Abroad to arrange to have the body 
transported as it was, together with the results of the autopsy carried out in Kabul. On 
7 December 2005, 3D Global Solutions, the company that had selected Mr. Hichard, blamed the 
United States Department of State for failing to provide information about the circumstances and 
cause of death and pointed out that, as the contract had been concluded with MVM Inc., 
3D Global Solutions was not liable. The body arrived as a package at the Lima Airport customs 
office, with a death certificate stating that cause of death unknown. The autopsy carried out by 
the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Lima on 25 December 2005 revealed that the cause of death 
was asphyxiation by hanging due to constriction to the neck. However, because the body was by 
now at the reconstitution stage it was not possible to determine the approximate time of death. 
The autopsy also showed that it was not possible to establish the medical and legal aetiology 
owing to the lack of information about the events leading up to the death, the scene-of-death 
investigation, the deceased&#8217;s medical history and any medical attention he might have received. 
On 23 February 2006, the consular section of the United States Embassy in Kabul certified that 
the cause of death was suicide. 
</p>
<p>36. The press has kept the Peruvian public informed of all these events. Through the Secretary 
for Peruvian Communities Abroad, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs met with the private security 
companies involved, the relatives, and the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office,<b>25</b> and contacted the Department 
of State in Washington. The Congress of Peru requested information on the matter and called in 
officials from the Ministries of Defence, Foreign Affairs and Labour. It was apparently also

</b>  The Ombudsman is not competent to request information from outside Peru. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/7/Add.2

</p>
<p>suggested that Peru&#8217;s National Security Council might ask the United States Government to 
inspect the living conditions of Peruvians working as &#8220;independent contractors&#8221; in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. 
</p>
<p>37. In a context of a globalized world economy and the privatization of public services, 
departments of the United States Government, such as the Pentagon and the Department of State, 
have contracted private security companies to provide protection in armed conflict zones such as 
Afghanistan and Iraq.<b>26</b> The companies that have won a contract with the United States 
Government have in their turn set up or subcontracted companies registered in the United States 
or abroad. In Peru, where there is unemployment, these intermediary companies (some of them 
&#8220;ghost&#8221; companies that later vanished) have selected ex-members of the military and the police 
with at least two years&#8217; military experience, who would ultimately be recruited by a transnational 
private security company. 
</p>
<p>38. In this maze it is impossible to determine liability and accountability. The United States 
Government says that these were &#8220;private contracts between companies and individuals&#8221;. The 
intermediary companies say they merely selected personnel on the basis of criteria provided by 
the contracting companies. When asked for information regarding the purpose, objectives and 
number of contracts concluded and the Peruvians who travelled to armed conflict zones,<b>27</b> they 
reply that they are unable to provide precise and explicit information on such matters. If the 
Peruvian authorities ask to see the contract concluded between the intermediary companies and 
North American parent companies such as Triple Canopy or MVM Inc., they reply that, as 
private companies, they are under no obligation to provide them. Finally, any claim for 
compensation must be made under the Base Defense Act in the United States. The insurance 
company usually refuses to compensate the family, as was the case with the deaths of the two 
Peruvians, on the grounds that the death was not &#8220;caused by or during the performance of work 
activities&#8221;.<b>28</b> Under the contracts signed, any dispute must be settled by United States courts. </p>
<p>39. The absence of legislation, regulation and appropriate oversight at the national level in 
Peru, as in many other countries, has produced a legal vacuum that benefits private security 
companies operating in the international market and looking for third-country nationals to hire as 
&#8220;security guards&#8221; in armed conflict zones. 
</p>
<p><b>B. Activities, operations, functioning and oversight of private 
security companies in Peru 
</b></p>
<p>40. The privatization of security has expanded enormously since the 1990s because the 
Government does not seem to have increased police numbers. Peru has about 92,000 police for a

</p>
<p><b>26
</b>  The private security companies do not consider the protection of convoys, buildings or people 
</p>
<p>to be direct action.

</p>
<p>population of 28 million,<b>29</b> which is insufficient, and it is for that reason that private security 
firms are authorized. In many cases, these companies are run by former members of the Armed 
Forces or the Police, or they occupy senior positions. Peru also seems to experience the 
&#8220;revolving door&#8221; syndrome whereby, when they retire, members of the military and police are 
hired by private security companies or start their own. The Ministry of the Interior apparently 
authorizes these companies to hire off-duty police officers to protect buildings; the officer&#8217;s 
weapon is the property of the police, not of the company. 
</p>
<p>41. A municipal citizen-protection system, known as the <i>serenazgo</i> or local watch, has also 
developed and is paid for out of residents&#8217; taxes. Watchmen are hired to patrol the district or 
municipality, but off-duty police officers may also be hired to work with them. These workers 
are very vulnerable in labour terms and earn very little (around US$ 150 per month). Any action 
by the watchmen, such as an arrest, must have the approval of a police officer, and should be 
taken when the police officer is working with the watchman. However, there are cases where 
such action is taken without a police officer present. 
</p>
<p>42. Reports were received of the death of a Spaniard, killed and robbed by a watchman. 
Moreover, of the 69 attacks on transvestites, transgenders or transsexuals investigated by Runa in 
2006, 52 were committed by watchmen.<b>30</b> Because local taxes vary from municipality to 
municipality, the rich ones have better protection, which is against the universal principle of 
non-discrimination in the right to security. In addition, the lack of any overall civic security 
policy means that each of Peru&#8217;s 1,600 districts has a different strategy. The State is thus 
abdicating its duty to protect its citizens. 
</p>
<p>43. Another problem is the <i>guachimanes</i>, a form of private security provided by individuals 
acting as guards who protect a residential area by surrounding the houses or preventing free 
passage to carry out checks. This is a violation of the right to freedom of movement. At the same 
time, in marginalized districts residents organize their own protection, frequently taking the law 
into their own hands. 
</p>
<p>44. There are around 100,000 private individuals offering security services: 50,000 private 
vigilantes and a further 50,000 casual <i>guachimanes</i>,<b>31</b> who are badly exploited. Their labour 
rights are violated: instead of an 8-hour day they are required to work a 12-hour day, with 
6 hours off the following day and a wage of US$ 50 a month and no social security. It is their 
exploitative working conditions that explain <i>guachimanes</i>&#8217; aggressive behaviour. 
</p>
<p>45. In addition, transnational natural resource extraction companies operating in very deserted 
spots with little or no police presence have their own private security systems.

</p>
<p>46. The peasant patrols, first set up in Cajamarca in the 1980s, are another form of private 
security arrangement. The Peasant Patrols Act (No. 27908), of 2003, &#8220;authorizes such 
associations to provide security services in their villages, peacefully resolve conflicts in 
accordance with local custom, actively involve themselves in their villages&#8217; development and 
monitor the local authorities and watch over public property&#8221;.<b>32</b> These are groups of some 20 to 
60 people from the same village who gather at night to watch over their animals and protect 
them. They are not armed but carry shepherds&#8217; staffs, ropes and whips. They perform policing 
tasks and administer justice and have apparently had some success in the absence of State 
services. They operate in some 14 regions of Peru. Clashes have been reported between peasant 
patrols and mining companies&#8217; private security companies. 
</p>
<p>47. There are also Civil Self-Defence Committees, made up of paramilitaries who collude with 
the Armed Forces, operating in Cuzco and the central region of Peru and with more than 50,000 
members. 
</p>
<p><b>C. Involvement in social conflicts of private security companies providing protection 
services to transnational mining or natural resource extraction companies 
</b></p>
<p>48. According to information received, members of private security companies and police 
officers engaged in private security work are intimidating the population of Cajamarca, notably 
environmental rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>49. In 2006 the National Human Rights Coordinating Committee reported 83 attacks on 
environmental and human rights defenders, witnesses, victims and expert witnesses; 35 of these 
attacks involved environmental rights defenders in La Oroya, Cajamarca and Yurimaguas.

expansion project pitted the community of Combayo against the Yanacocha mining company.<b>33</b>

<p>  Yanacocha, owned by Newmont Gold Corporation, the Buenaventura mining company and 
the World Bank&#8217;s International Finance Corporation, operates in a region containing 
65 communities with 20,000 inhabitants and employs 8,000 people (www.yanacocha.com.pe/ 
yanacocha.htm). Complaints have been brought against it for destruction of springs, pollution of 
rivers, streams and irrigation canals that supply thousands of rural families and the town of 
Cajamarca; the death of flora and fauna; contamination of the soil and grazing lands with 
mercury, arsenic and cyanide; and failure to comply with its undertakings in respect of 
development projects in the region. It is also accused of forcibly expropriating farmers&#8217; land 
between 1992 and 1994. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/7/Add.2 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>In the clash between the mine&#8217;s security guards and the villagers of Combayo, one farmer, 
Isidro Llanos Cheverr&#237;a, was shot twice and killed. Three police officers working as private 
security guards at Yanacocha were identified as suspects by investigators. It has yet to be 
determined whether they were hired to provide such services by the mining company or by the 
Forza security company,<b>34</b> contracted to provide private security services to Yanacocha. 
</p>
<p>51. The Ba&#241;os del Inca Provincial Prosecutor&#8217;s Office is keeping the investigation open and 
judicial proceedings have not yet been initiated. The calibre of the weapons and ammunition 
used by the mining company, which is guarded by Forza, has been tested to ascertain whether 
any of them were used in firing the shots that killed the farmer. 
</p>
<p>52. The Working Group also received information concerning an operation called &#8220;Operation 
Diablo&#8221;, against members of the Grupo de Formaci&#243;n e Intervenci&#243;n para el Desarollo 
Sostenible (GRUFIDES) (Sustainable Development Training and Action Group). Three Catholic 
priests and members of their families, and 40 local representatives and environmental leaders 
from farming communities allege violation of their rights by Yanacocha. The operation was 
reportedly launched on 30 August 2006 using Surveillance Unit (OVISE) techniques such as 
tailing and spying by physical and electronic means, undercover approaches and infiltration; and 
slander, threats and intimidation - similar methods to those used in the Fujimori-Montesinos era, 
with the aim of intimidating victims and breaking them down psychologically, as well as running 
slander campaigns to damage their reputation. 
</p>
<p>53. The executive director of GRUFIDES, Mirtha V&#225;squez Chuquil&#237;n, and the group&#8217;s 
founder, Fr. Marco Antonio Arana Zegarra,<b>35</b> have been subjected to threats and 
intimidation. On 0 October a man was taken in by the Criminal Investigation Department 
(DEINCRI) for filming GRUFIDES coordinator Lu&#237;s Urtecho Linares, but was released for lack 
of evidence. 
</p>
<p>54. On 14 November 2006 Miguel &#193;ngel Salda&#241;a Medina was arrested as he was following 
Fr. Arana. The police search of his person<b>36</b> and of his home<b>37</b> turned up documentation and

directors, it has international certification and implements social welfare programmes.

more than 4 months, something that implies a solid espionage infrastructure. A building had 
been rented next door to the GRUFIDES headquarters and the surveillance was conducted from 
two street-vendor stalls. Also found were sheets of photos of members of three environmental 
rights defence organizations Frente Unido de Defensa de la Vida y del Medio Ambiente (Life 
and Environment United Defence Front), Coordinadora de Pueblos Afectados por la Miner&#237;a 
(Coordinating Committee for Villages Affected by Mining), and the Regional Federation of 
Peasant Patrols of Cajamarca, each labelled with an alias. The statements taken<b>38</b> and the 
property confiscated by the police in the course of the house search indicated links between 
C &amp; G Investigaciones<b>39</b> and Forza.<b>40</b> 
</p>
<p>55. The Government ordered the police and the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office to investigate and 
to bring proceedings against those responsible for the undercover action against GRUFIDES<b>41</b> 
and repudiated the use of all illegal methods of surveillance and monitoring of any citizen. 
However, the authorities let it be known that the spying operations were a private undertaking 
and the State was unconnected with any of them.

<b>44
</b></p>
<p>  Office of Provincial Preventive Prosecutor No. 2, Cajamarca, which opened preliminary 
investigation No. 93-2006. 
<b>45
</b></p>
<p>  On 25 January 2007, by decision No. 018-2007-5FPPC, the Office of Provincial Criminal 
Prosecutor No. 5 in Cajamarca declared &#8220;the criminal complaint against Miguel &#193;ngel 
Salda&#241;a Medina and C&#233;sar Hel&#237; C&#225;ceres Garrido for an alleged offence against personal 
freedom, by moral coercion against Marco Antonio Arana Zegarra and Mirtha V&#225;squez 
Chuquil&#237;n, finally closed for lack of grounds for bringing criminal charges&#8221;. In his decision, the 
Prosecutor points out that &#8220;Peru&#8217;s Criminal Code currently contains no criminal offence defining 
the behaviour evinced by the investigators as a crime; while such behaviour may well be 
contrary to morality and decency or ethics, it is not a criminal offence ...&#8221;.

</b></p>
<p>  As the President of the Council of Ministers told <i>La Rep&#250;blica</i>, &#8220;It has not escaped my notice 
that the suspected perpetrators have not been summoned to appear. That is the least that should 
have been done before deciding whether or not to proceed with an investigation.&#8221; National Radio 
Coordinator, 5 February 2007, www.cnr.org.pe.

<p>  Members of GRUFIDES commented in the press on the fact that Fr. Arana was given police 
security but not other members of the organization. Protection is provided from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; 
the remainder of the time he is unprotected. </p>

<p>had been intimidated and received death threats for his complaints against opencast gold mining 
and the pollution it caused in 200 lagoons that supply the community in the lower part of the 
mine. Becerra Cotrina had reported the threats to the authorities. 
</p>
<p>60. The Provincial Prosecutor of the Combined Provincial Prosecutor&#8217;s Office of 
Ba&#241;os del Inca, Cajamarca, filed a criminal complaint against Aguinaldo Rodr&#237;guez Chuqimango 
and Fortunato Rodr&#237;guez Chuqimango for the murder. Fortunately, Rodr&#237;guez Chuqimango was 
arrested on suspicion of the murder and Aguinaldo Rodr&#237;guez Chuqimango was shot and killed 
in February 2007. 
</p>
<p>61. All this shows that these are not isolated cases but repeated occurrences in Cajamarca 
province, and indeed in other regions of Peru. Media enquiries have revealed links between 
private security companies and intelligence agents, apparently for the purpose of spying on 
environmental rights defence organizations in La Oroya, Yauli and Atalaya, in Ucayali province. 
These inquiries appear to indicate that private security companies are purchasing information 
gathered by State intelligence services on environmental leaders and selling it on to mining 
companies.<b>48</b> 
</p>
<p>62. There seems to be a campaign in Peru to discredit NGOs, the Church, community members 
and small farmers, with the aim of provoking a confrontation with those who earn their 
livelihood from mining.<b>49</b> In 2004, information started circulating<b>50</b> warning the population about 
the activities of community radio stations, NGOs, peasant patrols and certain circles of the 
Church, who are charged with working with left-wing groups to attack mining projects in Peru. It 
is these campaigns that formed the backdrop to the murder of Esmundo Becerra Cotrina and the 
clashes between the residents of Cajamarca and GRUFIDES. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Working Group is grateful to the Peruvian authorities for their speedy issuance of an 
invitation and their close cooperation with the Working Group, which was consistent with the 
standing invitation issued by Peru to all special procedures mandates and its current membership 
of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>64. The Working Group commends the Peruvian State for its prompt accession to the 
International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries, 
as part of its policy of preventing the recruitment of Peruvians as mercenaries.

</p>
<p>65. The Working Group recognizes the efforts made by the Government to regulate private 
security companies under Act No. 28879, for which implementing regulations are in preparation, 
and under Act No. 28806 (Labour Inspection Act) and Act No. 28950, on the Prevention of 
Trafficking in Persons and Smuggling of Migrants, but also notes with concern the appearance of 
new modalities in private security. 
</p>
<p>66. The Working Group sees the use of &#8220;independent contractors&#8221; by transnational private 
security companies in Iraq and Afghanistan as one of the new forms of mercenarism to emerge 
in the twenty-first century. These contracts can be viewed as establishing the same, or very 
similar, conditions to those set forth in article 1 of the 1989 International Convention. Although 
the contract does not state it in so many words, these &#8220;independent contractors&#8221; are individuals 
who have been recruited abroad, are motivated by the desire for private gain<b>51</b> to fight in an 
armed conflict - for in providing such services they will be exposed to the extreme and 
unpredictable risks and perils of war - and to take part in the hostilities. Unlike article 47 of 
Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions, the 1989 Convention does not use the term 
&#8220;direct part&#8221;, which means an independent contractor may perfectly well carry out passive 
functions but still be taking part in the hostilities.<b>52</b> The Peruvians recruited in this way are 
neither nationals nor residents of either of the parties to the conflict. Nor are they military, 
members of the Army of the United States, one of the parties to the conflict, and they are not 
civilians since they are armed. They have not been sent by a State on official duty. The fine legal 
point is the fact that MVM Inc. and Triple Canopy, the contracting companies, admit to working 
directly for the United States Department of State.<b>53</b> American private security companies have 
concluded contracts that appear to detail activities related to mercenarism, such as recruitment, 
training, financing and use of persons for the purposes of commercial gain.<b>54</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>51
</b>  Those who stand to gain most are the private security companies and subcontractors. 
</p>
<p>Between them they take a nine-tenths share of the total amount of the original contract with the 
Government of the United States for each Peruvian &#8220;independent contractor&#8221;. See A/HRC/4/42, 
para. 36. 
<b>52
</b></p>
<p>  Triple Canopy, through Gun Supply, had asked the Army Arms and Ammunition Factory for 
military-calibre ammunition for use in training Peruvian &#8220;independent contractors&#8221;. The 
contractors reported that in Baghdad they had been armed with light machine guns. All of this 
indicates that they are prepared for participation in the hostilities and that the dividing line 
between passive and active functions in a conflict zone is a very fine one. 
<b>53
</b></p>
<p>  Information confirmed by the United States Embassy in Lima in a letter 
dated 28 September 2005 to the Commander-in-Chief of the Peruvian Army, stating that 
&#8220;Triple Canopy Inc. has a legitimate current contract with the Department of State of the 
United States of America to provide security services.&#8221; 
<b>54
</b></p>
<p>  See note 24 above. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/7/Add.2

</p>
<p>67. The Working Group is concerned at the signing of a contract between Gun Supply SAC 
and the Army Arms and Ammunition Factory SA that allowed the use of military facilities. The 
Working Group welcomes the Ministry of Defence investigation showing that the Army failed to 
evaluate the political and international implications or to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
or the Ministry of Defence; it also welcomes the authorities&#8217; assurances that situations of this 
kind will not arise again. 
</p>
<p>68. The Working Group is concerned at the recruitment and training of hundreds of Peruvians 
by private security companies for service in Afghanistan and Iraq. Some of these companies, 
subsidiaries of foreign multinationals, were registered in Peru, while others were operating 
illegally. Two Peruvians have been killed and a number of others injured. There are allegations 
of contractual irregularities, poor working conditions, overcrowding, unreasonable hours, failure 
to pay wages, abusive treatment and isolation, and failure to meet basic health and hygiene 
needs. Despite having been hired as security guards, they received military training in Peru or a 
third country and ended up performing tasks not specified in their contracts and thus not agreed. 
</p>
<p>69. The Working Group is aware that the actions of certain private security companies 
constitute new forms of mercenarism and that they may have taken the Peruvian authorities by 
surprise. Nevertheless, serious omissions on the part of the Peruvian State have been noted, 
along with shortcomings in compliance with its obligations under international law. The 
unfavourable socio-economic situation and marked level of unemployment that make contracts 
of this kind attractive to people do not diminish the Government&#8217;s responsibility. The Working 
Group is concerned at the lack of action on the part of State bodies, particularly the Ministry of 
Labour and the Attorney-General&#8217;s Office. 
</p>
<p>70. The Working Group is concerned at private security companies&#8217; hiring of off-duty 
members of the security forces, who use State property such as uniforms, weapons and 
ammunition; also at the type of arms and ammunition used by these companies, particularly 
those guarding mines. Peruvian law restricts access to and use of war materiel to the Armed 
Forces and the police, and possession of weapons of war is an offence under the Criminal Code. 
Yet it seems that private security companies can purchase unlimited quantities of arms and 
ammunition. 
</p>
<p>71. The Working Group draws attention to what is a growing problem in Latin America, 
namely the ever-closer connection between private security companies guarding key geostrategic 
sites such as mines, oilfields and water sources and the violent repression of social protest. 
</p>
<p>72. The Working Group is concerned at the conflation of legitimate social protest by 
communities in defence of their lands and environmental rights with criminal or terrorist 
activities and at the elimination, indictment and intimidation of community leaders, as well as 
intelligence agencies&#8217; surveillance of protesters. It is also concerned at the lack of any effective 
system of protection for human rights defenders. Those responsible for these unlawful acts seem 
to enjoy a degree of impunity inasmuch as, in many cases of police or judicial complaint, no 
charges are brought against the perpetrators or else those responsible remain at large. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/7/Add.2 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p>73. The Working Group deplores the fact that, despite the Government&#8217;s efforts to protect 
Fr. Arana, GRUFIDES leaders continued to be subjected to threats, tailing, spying and 
harassment in 2007.<b>55</b> 
</p>
<p>74. The Working Group welcomes the drafting by the Congressional Defence Commission of 
a bill prohibiting the hiring of Peruvians to provide security services in armed conflict zones. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The Working Group wishes to make the following recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The Office of the Ombudsman and sectors of civil society working to protect 
human rights should be involved in the drafting of the bill to bring Peru&#8217;s legislation into 
line with international law, so as to ensure the broadest possible legal interpretation 
covering not only the offence of acting as a mercenary but also new forms of mercenarism; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The Congressional Defence Commission&#8217;s bill prohibiting the hiring of 
Peruvians to provide security services in armed conflict zones should be adopted; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) The authorities should maintain transparent registers of private security 
companies covering all matters relating to ownership, statutes, purposes and functions, as 
well as a system of regular inspections. Legislative and regulatory measures should be 
adopted to prevent any conflicts of interest when serving State officials act as owners or 
managers of such companies. Inquiries should be made to ascertain whether there are any 
conflicts of interest between the posts held by those members or former members of the 
military or police who are involved in private security companies. An authority should be 
set up over the Ministry of the Interior, either a parliamentary committee or a 
commissioner, with the power to monitor the activities of private security companies and to 
receive complaints; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The competent authorities, in particular the Attorney-General&#8217;s Office, should 
investigate all unresolved cases, especially the deaths of Peruvian nationals in the course of 
their activities in Afghanistan and Iraq; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Urgent measures should be taken to protect the rights of Peruvians still 
employed in Iraq and Afghanistan; 
</b></p>
<p>

personal liberty, privacy and life, and those responsible for the murders of community 
leaders;

<p><b> (g) The necessary judicial action should be taken to determine whether
