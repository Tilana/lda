CHESAPEAKE ENERGY CORPORATION REPORTS 2016 SECOND QUARTER
FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL RESULTS
OKLAHOMA CITY, August 4, 2016 – Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) today
reported financial and operational results for the 2016 second quarter. Highlights include:
•Total debt reduction of more than $1.0 billion year to date
2016 second quarter production averaged approximately 657,100 boe per day; company
increases full-year 2016 production guidance by 3% while maintaining capital expenditure
guidance
•Cost structure improvements lead to lower full-year 2016 production expense guidance
Company increases target of 2016 total gross proceeds from asset divestitures by year-end to
more than $2.0 billion from $1.2 to $1.7 billion; selected Haynesville Shale acreage expected to
be sold
•
•
Doug Lawler, Chesapeake’s Chief Executive Officer, commented, “In 2016, we have made
substantial progress on many fronts, including the reduction of more than $1 billion of debt, the
reduction of complexity in our portfolio through the purchase of oil and natural gas interests
previously conveyed in certain volumetric production payment transactions (VPPs), the
continued improvement in our cash cost structure and the optimization of our current portfolio
through non-core asset sales.
“Financial discipline remains our top priority, and we continue to work toward additional solutions
to improve our liquidity, reduce our midstream commitments and enhance our margins. With
continued improvements in our operating expenses and the disposition of non-core properties,
we have refined our portfolio to provide a more competitive foundation for Chesapeake. In
addition, the application of new technologies, including longer laterals and enhanced completion
techniques, to our extensive undeveloped acreage position provides us with a robust portfolio of
development opportunities.”
Lawler continued, “As a result of our portfolio’s strong performance to date in 2016, we have
increased our total production guidance for the remainder of the year. As for an initial look into
2017, we believe our oil production will be relatively flat in 2017 as compared to 2016, while total
production volumes are projected to be down approximately 5% compared to 2016 levels. With
the breadth and depth of our large acreage position, the evolution of technologies being applied
to our portfolio and the reduction in our leverage and complexity, we believe that the next few
months will be a very exciting time for Chesapeake.”
2016 Second Quarter Results
For the 2016 second quarter, Chesapeake’s revenues declined by 54% year over year, primarily
due to a decrease in the average realized commodity prices received for its production,
unrealized losses from oil and natural gas derivatives and a decrease in the average realized
commodity prices received for its marketing operations. Average daily production for the 2016
second quarter of approximately 657,100 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) consisted of
approximately 90,500 barrels (bbls) of oil, 2.960 billion cubic feet (bcf) of natural gas and 73,200
bbls of natural gas liquids (NGL). As a result of the company's strong production through the first
six months of 2016, Chesapeake has raised its full-year 2016 production

guidance by 3% (using midpoints) from 605,000 to 635,000 boe per day to a new range of
625,000 to 650,000 boe per day. A summary of the company’s guidance for 2016 is provided in
the Outlook dated August 4, 2016, beginning on Page 17.
Chesapeake's cash expenses continue to decline due to its focus on cost discipline. Average
production expenses during the 2016 second quarter were $3.05 per boe. G&A expenses
(including stock-based compensation) during the 2016 second quarter were $1.02 per boe.
Combined production and G&A expenses (including stock-based compensation) during the 2016
second quarter were $4.07 per boe, a decrease of 25% year over year and 2% from the 2016 first
quarter.
Chesapeake reported a net loss available to common stockholders of $1.792 billion, or $2.48 per
share, while the company's ebitda for the 2016 second quarter was $(1.394) billion. The primary
drivers of the net loss were a noncash impairment of the carrying value of Chesapeake's oil and
natural gas properties of approximately $1.045 billion, largely resulting from decreases in the
trailing 12-month average first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas prices as of June 30, 2016,
as compared to March 31, 2016, and unrealized hedging losses of approximately $544 million.
Adjusting for these and other items that are typically excluded by securities analysts, the 2016
second quarter adjusted net loss available to common stockholders was $145 million, or $0.14
per common share, while the company's adjusted ebitda was $252 million in the 2016 second
quarter. Reconciliations of financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP) to non-GAAP measures are provided on pages 12 – 16 of this
release.
Capital Spending Overview
Chesapeake’s total capital investments were approximately $456 million during the 2016 second
quarter, compared to approximately $957 million in the 2015 second quarter, as summarized in
the table below. While the company has reiterated its total capital investments program for 2016
of approximately $1.3 to $1.8 billion, it now expects to be at the higher end of its current guidance
range due to additional drilling and completion activity as a result of efficiency gains and an
acquisition of additional working interests in the Haynesville Shale. A summary of the company’s
guidance for 2016 is provided in the Outlook dated August 4, 2016, beginning on Page 17.

Balance Sheet and Liquidity
As of June 30, 2016, Chesapeake’s debt principal balance was approximately $8.7 billion,
including approximately $100 million of borrowings outstanding on the company's $4.0 billion
revolving credit facility, compared to $9.7 billion as of December 31, 2015, and $11.7 billion as of
June 30, 2015. Since January
2
1, 2016, the company has retired at maturity, repurchased or exchanged for equity approximately
$1.0 billion of debt, $518 million of which was due or putable to the company in 2017.
In April 2016, Chesapeake amended its $4.0 billion revolving credit facility maturing in 2019 to
reaffirm its borrowing base, restructure financial covenants and increase its ability to issue
secured debt. Using June 30, 2016 crude oil and natural gas strip pricing, Chesapeake estimates
that the PV-10 of its proved oil and gas reserves was approximately $11.1 billion, compared to
approximately $3.1 billion when using the average of commodity prices on the first day of the
month over the trailing 12-month period (see Page 16 of this release for additional information). In
addition to $100 million of borrowings under the company's revolving credit facility, letters of
credit issued under the credit facility were approximately $813 million as of June 30, 2016, which
included a $461 million supersedeas bond supporting the company's appeal of the judgment
issued in 2015 with respect to the company's 2019 Notes litigation.
Asset Acquisition and Divestitures Update
Through the 2016 second quarter, the company’s asset divestiture activities have totaled $964
million in net proceeds received to date, after post-closing adjustments. In addition, consideration
of more than $100 million was withheld subject to certain title, environmental and other standard
contingencies, the majority of which Chesapeake expects to collect in the third quarter. In
conjunction with certain of these sales, Chesapeake repurchased oil and natural gas interests
previously sold to third parties in connection with four of its VPP transactions for approximately
$259 million. A majority of the acquired interests were part of the asset divestitures discussed
above and the company no longer has any further commitments related to these VPPs. With the
closing of these VPP acquisitions in the 2016 second quarter, the company has only two VPPs
remaining.
The company continues to focus on select asset divestitures and is currently planning to sell
additional properties by year-end 2016, including a portion of its Haynesville Shale properties.
As a result, Chesapeake has raised its 2016 guidance for total gross asset divestitures either
closed or under signed sales agreements to now be more than $2.0 billion, compared to its
previous range of $1.2 to $1.7 billion.
In July 2016, Chesapeake purchased certain operated working interests to enhance its
Haynesville Shale acreage position for approximately $87 million, increasing its average
operated working interest in the area to approximately 83% and adding to its net acreage position
by approximately 70,000 net acres. The company closed this transaction in the 2016 third
quarter.

Operations Update
Chesapeake is currently utilizing 10 drilling rigs across its operating areas, three of which are
located in the Eagle Ford Shale, three in the Haynesville Shale, three in the Mid-Continent area
and one rig in the Utica Shale. Due to greater capital efficiencies and lower oilfield service costs,
Chesapeake is currently planning to operate these 10 rigs throughout the remainder of the year
and, as a result, plans to drill more than 100 additional wells and place approximately 75
additional wells on production in 2016. While the company is maintaining its 2016 total capital
expenditures guidance to be approximately $1.3 to $1.8 billion, it now expects to be at the higher
end of its current guidance range.
In July 2016, Chesapeake placed the CA 12&13-15-15 1H horizontal well on production,
targeting the Haynesville Shale in Caddo Parish, Louisiana. This well's results provide further
confirmation that the company's current completion optimization techniques, along with extended
laterals, are having a significant impact on higher sustained flow rates and the increased
potential for higher rates of return in all areas of the Haynesville. With reducing cluster spacing
and increased proppant loading, this 10,000-foot lateral well reached a maximum production rate
of approximately 38.0 million cubic feet of gas (mmcf) per day with a flowing tubing pressure of
7,400 psi. The company's current estimate of the ultimate recovery from this well is approximately
22 to 24 bcf with an estimated completed well cost of approximately $9.8 million. The PCK 1H, a
7,500-foot lateral well located in DeSoto Parish, reached a maximum production rate of 31.0
mmcf per day with a flowing pressure of 7,600 psi using similar completion techniques for an
estimated well cost of $8.4 million. Chesapeake believes that leading-edge completion
techniques, along with access to Gulf Coast pricing, could increase field-wide productivity by
opening up new areas in the field that were previously economically challenged.

This news release and the accompanying Outlook include "forward-looking statements” within
the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are statements other than statements of
historical fact. They include statements that give our current expectations or forecasts of future
events, production and well connection forecasts, estimates of operating costs, anticipated
capital and operational efficiencies, planned development drilling and expected drilling cost
reductions, general and administrative expenses, capital expenditures, the timing of anticipated
noncore asset sales and proceeds to be received therefrom, projected cash flow and liquidity, our
ability to enhance our cash flow and financial flexibility, plans and objectives for future operations
(including our ability to optimize base production and execute gas gathering agreements), the
ability of our employees, portfolio strength and operational leadership to create long-term value,
and the assumptions on which such statements are based. Although we believe the expectations
and forecasts reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no
assurance they will prove to have been correct. They can be affected by inaccurate or changed
assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results include those
described under "Risk Factors” in Item 1A of our annual report on Form 10-K and any updates to
those factors set forth in Chesapeake's subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current
reports on Form 8-K (available at http://www.chk.com/investors/sec-filings).  These risk factors
include the volatility of oil, natural gas and NGL prices; the limitations our level of indebtedness
may have on our financial flexibility; our inability to access the capital markets on favorable terms
or at all; the availability of cash flows from operations and other funds to finance reserve
replacement costs or satisfy our debt obligations; a further downgrade in our credit rating
requiring us to post more collateral under certain commercial arrangements; write-downs of our
oil and natural gas asset carrying values due low commodity prices; our ability to replace
reserves and sustain production; uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil, natural gas
and NGL reserves and projecting future rates of production and the amount and timing of
development expenditures; our ability to generate profits or achieve targeted results in drilling
and well operations; leasehold terms expiring before production can be established; commodity
derivative activities resulting in lower prices realized on oil, natural gas and NGL sales; the need
to secure derivative liabilities and the inability of counterparties to satisfy their obligations;
adverse developments or losses from pending or future litigation and regulatory proceedings,
including royalty claims; charges incurred in response to market conditions and in connection
with our ongoing actions to reduce financial leverage and complexity; drilling and operating risks
and resulting liabilities; effects of environmental protection laws and regulation on our business;
legislative and regulatory initiatives further regulating hydraulic fracturing; our need to secure
adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations and to dispose of or recycle the water used;
impacts of potential legislative and regulatory actions addressing climate change; federal and
state tax proposals affecting our industry; potential OTC derivatives regulation limiting our ability
to hedge against commodity price fluctuations; competition in the oil and gas exploration and
production industry; a deterioration in general economic, business or industry conditions;
negative public perceptions of our industry; limited control over properties we do not operate;
pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints and transportation interruptions; terrorist
activities and cyber-attacks adversely impacting our operations; potential challenges of our spin-
off of Seventy Seven Energy Inc. (SSE) in connection with SSE's recently completed bankruptcy
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code; an interruption in operations at our headquarters
due to a catastrophic event; the continuation of suspended dividend payments on our common
stock and preferred stock; certain anti-takeover provisions that affect shareholder rights; and our
inability to increase or maintain our liquidity through debt repurchases, capital exchanges, asset
sales, joint ventures, farmouts or other means.
In addition, disclosures concerning the estimated contribution of derivative contracts to our future
results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date. These market
prices are subject to significant volatility. Our production forecasts are also dependent upon
many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the
outcome of future drilling activity. Expected asset sales may not be completed in the time frame
anticipated or at all. We caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking
statements, which speak only as of the date of this news release, and we undertake no obligation
to update any of the information provided in this release or the accompanying Outlook, except as
required by applicable law.

Realized gains and losses include the following items: (i) settlements of nondesignated
derivatives related to current period production revenues, (ii) prior period settlements for option
premiums and for early-terminated derivatives originally scheduled to settle against current
period production revenues, and (iii) gains and losses related to de-designated cash flow
hedges originally designated to settle against current period production revenues. Unrealized
gains and losses include the change in fair value of open derivatives scheduled to settle
against future period production revenues offset by amounts reclassified as realized gains and
losses during the period. Although we no longer designate our derivatives as cash flow
(a)
hedges for accounting purposes, we believe these definitions are useful to management and
investors in determining the effectiveness of our price risk management program.

Realized (gains) losses include settlements related to the current period interest accrual and
the effect of (gains) losses on early termination trades. Unrealized (gains) losses include

Operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities before changes in
assets and liabilities. Operating cash flow is presented because management believes it is a
useful adjunct to net cash provided by operating activities under GAAP. Operating cash flow is
widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and natural gas company's ability to generate
cash that is used to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service debt.
This measure is widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison,
rating and investment recommendations of companies within the oil and natural gas
exploration and production industry. Operating cash flow is not a measure of financial
performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from
operating, investing or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of
liquidity.
(b)
Ebitda represents net income before interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation,
depletion and amortization expense. Ebitda is presented as a supplemental financial
measurement in the evaluation of our business. We believe that it provides additional
information regarding our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and
working capital requirements. This measure is widely used by investors and rating agencies in
the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. Ebitda is
also a financial measurement that, with certain negotiated adjustments, is reported to our
lenders pursuant to our bank credit agreements and is used in the financial covenants in our
bank credit agreements. Ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP.
Accordingly, it should not be considered as a substitute for net income, income from
operations or cash flow provided by operating activities prepared in accordance with GAAP.

RECONCILIATION OF PV-9 AND PV-10 TO STANDARDIZED MEASURE
($ in millions)
(unaudited)
PV-9 is a non-GAAP metric used in the determination of the value of collateral under
Chesapeake's credit facility. PV-10 is a non-GAAP metric used by the industry, investors and
analysts to estimate the present value, discounted at 10% per annum, of estimated future cash
flows of the company's estimated proved reserves before income tax and asset retirement
obligations. The following table shows the reconciliation of PV-9 and PV-10 to the company's
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, the most directly comparable GAAP
measure, for the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the interim period ended June 30, 2016.
Management believes that PV-9 provides useful information to investors regarding the
company's collateral position and that PV-10 provides useful information to investors because it
is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and natural
gas companies. Because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company
when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid, management believes the use of a
pre-tax measure is valuable for evaluating the company. Neither PV-9 nor PV-10 should be
considered as an alternative to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as
computed under GAAP. With respect to PV-9 and PV-10 calculated as of an interim date, it is not
practical to calculate taxes for the related interim period because GAAP does not provide for
disclosure of standardized measure on an interim basis.
