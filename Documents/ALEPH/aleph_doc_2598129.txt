ANNUAL ACCOUNTS
The  Corporations  Act  requires  that  the  Annual  Report  (which  includes  the  financial  report,  directors’ 
report and auditors’ report) be tabled at the Annual General Meeting.
Shareholders will be given an opportunity to ask questions and make comments about the Annual Report 
of  the  Company  generally,  but  there  will  be  no  formal  resolution  submitted  in  respect  of  the  Annual 
Report.
2.
RESOLUTION 1 – REMUNERATION REPORT
The Remuneration Report is set out in the Directors’ Report in the Company's 2016 Annual Report.
The Corporations Act requires the Company to put a resolution to Shareholders that the Remuneration 
Report  be  adopted.    In  accordance  with  section  250R(3)  of  the  Corporations  Act,  the  vote  on  the 
Resolution is advisory only and does not bind the Directors or the Company.
In accordance with Division 9 of Part 2G.2 of the Corporations Act, if 25% or more of votes that are cast 
are voted against the adoption of the Remuneration Report at two consecutive Annual General Meetings, 
Shareholders will be required to vote at the second of those Annual General Meetings on a resolution (a 
“spill resolution”) that another meeting be  held within 90 days at which all of the  Company’s directors 
(other than the Managing Director) must go up for re-election.
It is noted that at the Company’s 2015 annual general meeting the votes cast against the remuneration 
report represented less than 25% of the total votes cast and accordingly, a spill resolution will not under 
any circumstances be required for the Annual General Meeting.
A voting exclusion applies to Resolution 1 in the terms set out in the Notice of Meeting.  Key Management 
Personnel  and their closely related parties may not vote on this Resolution and may  not  cast  a vote as 
proxy,  unless  the  proxy  appointment  gives  a  direction  on  how  to  vote  or  the  proxy  is  given  to  the 
Chairman and expressly authorises the Chairman to exercise the proxy.  The Chairman will use any such 
proxies to vote in favour of Resolution 1.
The Company encourages all Shareholders to cast their votes on Resolution 1 (Remuneration Report).
RESOLUTION 2 – RE-ELECTION OF A DIRECTOR (P. GREGORY KNOX)
Background
Resolution 2 seeks approval for the re-election of Mr Knox as a Director. Mr Knox was appointed as a non-
executive Director on 22 September 2011.
In accordance with Listing Rule 14.4 and clause 16.4 of the Constitution, at every Annual General Meeting, 
one third of the Directors for the  time being must  retire from office by rotation and are eligible for re-
election. The Directors to retire are those who have been in office for 3 years since their appointment or 
last re-appointment or who have been longest in office since their appointment or last re-appointment or, 
if the Directors have been in office for an equal length of time, by agreement.
Mr  Knox  retires  by  rotation  at  this  Annual  General  Meeting  and,  being  eligible,  offers  himself  for  re-
election.

Facility”).    The  10%  Placement  Facility  is  in  addition  to  the  Company’s  15%  placement  capacity  under 
Listing Rule 7.1.
An eligible entity for the purposes of Listing Rule 7.1A is an entity that is not included in the S&P/ASX 300 
Index and has a market capitalisation of $300 million or less.  The Company is an eligible entity.
7.2
Description of Listing Rule 7.1A
(a)
Shareholder approval
The ability to issue  Equity Securities  under the 10% Placement  Facility is subject  to  shareholder 
approval by way of a special resolution at an Annual General Meeting.
The effect of this Resolution will be to allow the Directors to issue Equity Securities under Listing 
Rule 7.1A during the 10% Placement Period.
Resolution 6 is a special resolution and therefore requires approval of 75% of the votes cast by 
Shareholders  present  and  eligible  to  vote  (in  person,  by  proxy,  by  attorney or,  in  the  case  of  a 
corporate Shareholder, by a corporate representative).
(b)
Equity Security
Any  Equity  Securities  issued  under  the  10%  Placement  Facility  must  be  in  the  same  class  as  an 
existing quoted class of Equity Securities of the Company.
As at the date of this Notice of Meeting, the Company has two quoted class of Equity Securities, 
being  Shares  and  Options,  and  the  number  of  Shares  currently  on  issue  is  up  to  156,219,987 
Shares and up to 34,036,704 Options. These include the Shares and Options expected to be issued 
under an entitlement issue announced on 27 July 2016.
(c)
Formula for calculating 10% Placement Facility
Listing Rule 7.1A.2 provides that eligible entities which have obtained shareholder approval at an 
Annual General Meeting may issue or agree to issue, during the 12 month period after the date of 
the  Annual  General  Meeting,  a  number  of  Equity  Securities  calculated  in  accordance  with  the 
following formula:
(A x D) – E
A  is  the  number  of  fully  paid  ordinary  shares  on  issue  12  months  before  the  date  of  issue  or 
agreement:
(a)  plus  the  number  of  fully  paid  ordinary  shares  issued  in  the  12  months  under  an
exception in Listing Rule 7.2;
(b)  plus the number of partly paid shares that became fully paid in the 12 months;
11
(c)  plus the number of fully paid ordinary shares issued in the 12 months with approval of 
holders of shares under Listing Rule 7.1 and 7.4. This does not include an issue of fully 
paid  ordinary  shares  under  the  entity’s  15%  placement  capacity  without  shareholder 
approval; 
less the number of fully paid shares cancelled in the 12 months.
(d)
Note that A has the same meaning in Listing Rule 7.1 when calculating an entity’s 15% placement 
capacity.
D is 10%.
E is the number of Equity Securities issued or agreed to be issued under Listing Rule 7.1A.2 in the 
12  months  before  the  date  of  the  issue  or  agreement  to  issue  that  are  not  issued  with  the 
approval of shareholders under Listing Rule 7.1 or 7.4.
(d)
Listing Rule 7.1 and Listing Rule 7.1A
The  ability  of  an  entity  to  issue  Equity  Securities  under  Listing  Rule  7.1A  is  in  addition  to  the 
entity’s 15% placement capacity under Listing Rule 7.1.
The actual number of Equity Securities that the Company will have capacity to issue under Listing 
Rule  7.1A will be calculated at  the date of issue of the  Equity Securities  in accordance with the 
formula set out above.
(e)
Minimum Issue Price
The issue price of Equity Securities issued under Listing Rule 7.1A must be not less than 75% of 
the  VWAP  of  Equity  Securities  in  the  same  class  calculated  over  the  15  Trading  Days  on  which 
trades were recorded in that class immediately before:
(i)
(ii)
the date on which the price at which the Equity Securities are to be issued is agreed; or
if the Equity Securities are not issued within 5 Trading Days of the date in paragraph (i) 
above, the date on which the Equity Securities are issued.
(f)
10% Placement Period
Shareholder approval of the 10% Placement Facility under Listing Rule 7.1A is valid from the date 
of  the  Annual  General Meeting  at  which  the  approval  is  obtained  and  expires on  the  earlier  to 
occur of:
(i)
(ii)
the date that is 12 months after  the  date of the  Annual General Meeting at which the 
approval is obtained; or
the  date  of  the  approval  by  shareholders  of  a transaction  under  Listing  Rules  11.1.2  (a 
significant  change  to  the  nature  or  scale  of  activities)  or  11.2  (disposal  of  main 
undertaking).
7.3
Specific information required by Listing Rule 7.3A
Pursuant to and in accordance with Listing Rule 7.3A, information is provided in relation to the approval 
of the 10% Placement Facility as follows:
(a)
The  Equity  Securities  will  be  issued  at  an  issue  price  of  not  less  than  75%  of  the  VWAP  of  the 
Company’s  Equity  Securities  in  the  same  class  calculated  over  the  15  Trading  Days  on  which 
trades were recorded in that class immediately before:
(i)
(ii)
the date on which the price at which the Equity Securities are to be issued is agreed; or
if the Equity Securities are not issued within 5 Trading Days of the date in paragraph (i) 
above, the date on which the Equity Securities are issued.
12
(b)
If Resolution 6 is approved by Shareholders and the Company issues Equity Securities under the 
10% Placement Facility, the existing Shareholders’ voting power in the Company will be diluted as 
shown in the below table. There is a risk that:
(i)
(ii)
the market  price  for the Company’s Equity Securities may be significantly lower on the 
date  of  the  issue  of  the  Equity  Securities  than  on  the  date  of  the  Annual  General 
Meeting; and
the Equity Securities may be issued at a price that is at a discount to the market price for 
the Company’s Equity Securities on the issue date or the Equity Securities are issued as 
part of the consideration for the acquisition of a new asset;
which may have an effect on the amount of funds raised by the issue of the Equity Securities.
The below  table  shows  the  dilution of existing Shareholders on the basis of the  current market 
price  of  Shares  and  the  current  number  of  ordinary  securities  for  variable  ‘A’  calculated  in 
accordance with the formula in Listing Rule 7.1A(2) as at the date of this Notice of Meeting.  The 
formula in Listing Rule 7.1A(2) is outlined above.
The table also shows:
(iii)
Two examples where variable ‘A’ has increased, by 50% and 100%. Variable ‘A’ is based 
on the number of Shares the Company has on issue. The number of Shares on issue may 
increase  as  a  result  of  issues  of  ordinary  securities  that  do  not  require  Shareholder 
approval  (for  example,  a  pro  rata  entitlements  issue  or  scrip  issued  under  a  takeover 
offer) or future specific placements under Listing Rule 7.1 or approved at a Shareholders’ 
meeting; and
(iv)
Two examples of where the issue price of Shares has decreased by 50% and increased by 
50% as against the current market price.

The table has been prepared on the following assumptions:
(v)
The Company issues the maximum number of Equity Securities available under  the 10% 
Placement Facility.
(vi)
No options are exercised before the date of the issue of Equity Securities.
13
(vii)
(viii)
(ix)

(xi)
The  10%  voting  dilution  reflects  the  aggregate  percentage  dilution  against  the  issued 
share  capital  at  the  time  of  issue.  This  is  why  the  voting  dilution  is  shown  in  each 
example as 10%.
The  table  does  not  show  an  example  of  dilution  that  may  be  caused  to  a  particular 
Shareholder  by  reason of placements  under the  10%  Placement  Facility,  based  on  that 
Shareholder’s holding at the date of the Annual General Meeting.
The table shows only the effect of issue of Equity Securities under Listing Rule 7.1A, not 
under  the  15%  placement  capacity  under  Listing  Rule  7.1  or  other  issues  of  Equity 
Securities.
The issue of Equity Securities under the 10% Placement Facility consists only of Shares.
The issue price is $0.24, being 75% of the VWAP of Shares calculated over the 15 Trading 
Days on which trades were recorded prior to the date of preparation of the Explanatory 
Statement.
(c)
The Company will only issue the Equity Securities during the 10% Placement Period. The approval 
under Resolution 6 for the issue of the Equity Securities will cease to be valid in the event that 
Shareholders approve a transaction under Listing Rule 11.1.2 (a significant change to the nature 
or scale of activities) or Listing Rule 11.2 (disposal of main undertaking).
(d)
The Company may seek to issue the Equity Securities for the following purposes:
(i)
(ii)
non-cash  consideration  for  the  acquisition  of  new  assets  and  investments.  In  such 
circumstances  the  Company  will  provide  a  valuation  of  the  non-cash  consideration  as 
required by Listing Rule 7.1A.3; or
cash  consideration  for  development  of  its  existing  projects  and/or  for  general  working 
capital.  In addition, the Company may use the cash consideration for  the acquisition of 
new assets and investments.
The Company will comply with the disclosure obligations under Listing Rules 7.1A(4) and 3.10.5A 
upon issue of any Equity Securities.
(e)
The Company’s allocation policy is dependent on the prevailing market conditions at the time of 
any proposed issue pursuant to the 10% Placement Facility. The identity of the allottees of Equity 
Securities will be determined on a case-by-case basis having regard to the factors including but 
not limited to the following:
(i)
the methods of raising funds that are available to the Company, including but not limited 
to, rights issues or other issues in which existing security holders can participate;
(ii)
the effect of the issue of the Equity Securities on the control of the Company;
(iii)
the financial situation and solvency of the Company; and
(iv)
advice from corporate, financial and broking advisors (if applicable).
The allottees under the 10% Placement Facility have not been determined as at the date of this 
Notice of Meeting but may include existing Shareholders and/or new Shareholders who are not 
Related Parties or Associates of a Related Party of the Company.
(f)
The  Company  previously  obtained  Shareholder  approval  under  Listing  Rule  7.1A  at  its  2015 
Annual General Meeting.  The total number of Equity Securities issued by the Company in the 12 
months  preceding  the  date  of  this  Notice  of  Meeting  is  90,083,516,  inclusive  of  the  Equity 
Securities the Company expects to issue pursuant to an entitlement offer announced on 27 July 
2016.  The percentage those Equity Securities represent of the total number of Equity Securities 
on  issue  at  the  commencement  of  the  12 month  period  is  84.94%.    The  table  at  Annexure  B
14
details all issues of Equity Securities by the Company during the 12 months preceding the date of 
this Notice of Meeting.
(g)
A voting exclusion statement is included in the  Notice of Meeting.  At the date of the Notice of 
Meeting, the Company has not approached any particular existing Shareholder or security holder 
or  an  identifiable  class  or existing  security  holder to  participate  in an  issue  of Equity  Securities 
pursuant to the Resolution. No existing Shareholder’s votes will therefore be excluded under the 
voting exclusion in this Notice of Meeting.
The Directors recommend that the Shareholders vote in favour of this Resolution.

issue of the Share under this resolution 7.
