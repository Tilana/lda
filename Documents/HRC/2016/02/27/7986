<p> The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 19/35 
requesting the High Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare and submit a thematic 
report on effective measures and best practices to ensure the promotion and protection of 
human rights in the context of peaceful protests.  
</p>
<p> Member States, regional organizations, national human rights institutions and civil 
society organizations provided input for this report. In accordance with resolution 19/35, 
this report also includes information drawn from treaty bodies and relevant thematic special 
procedure mandate holders. 
</p>
<p>  
 * Late submission. 
</p>

<p> Based on the input provided, the report outlines examples of effective measures and 
best practices to promote and support the promotion and protection of human rights in the 
context of peaceful protests. It concludes that peaceful protests are a fundamental aspect of 
a vibrant democracy. The promotion and protection of peaceful protests require not only an 
adequate legal framework but also continuous efforts for their effective implementation. 
Dialogue between protest organizers, administrative authorities and the police, as well as 
human rights training programmes for police forces, including on the use of force during 
protests, can contribute to the promotion and protection of the human rights linked to 
peaceful protests.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 19/35, the Human Rights Council requested the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights to prepare and submit a thematic report to the Council, prior to its 
twenty-second session, on effective measures and best practices to ensure the promotion 
and protection of human rights in the context of peaceful protests. 
</p>
<p>2. The Council encouraged relevant thematic special procedures mandate holders, 
including the Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the 
Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, to contribute to this report. It further 
requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights, to draw on the experience of treaty 
bodies and to seek the views of States and relevant partners, such as United Nations 
agencies, regional organizations, national human rights institutions and civil society 
organizations when preparing the report.1   
</p>
<p><b> II. Treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p>3. Participation in peaceful protests can be an important form of exercise of the rights 
to freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression established in articles 21 and 
19 respectively of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.2 According to 
general comment No. 34 (2011) of the Human Rights Committee, freedom of opinion and 
freedom of expression are indispensable conditions for the full development of the person; 
such freedoms are essential for any society and constitute the foundation stone for every 
free and democratic society (para. 2).  
</p>
<p>4. Recent jurisprudence of the Human Rights Committee noted the intimate connection 
between the acts protected by articles 19 and 21 of the Covenant.3 Other rights that may be 
applicable in case of peaceful protests include, for instance, the right to freedom of 
association (art. 22) and to take part in the conduct of public affairs (art. 25). The Human 
Rights Committee, in its general comment No. 25 (1996), confirms that enjoyment of the 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The following States submitted information: Armenia, Australia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Costa Rica, 
</p>
<p>Democratic Republic of the Congo, Estonia, Guatemala, Madagascar, Moldova, Mongolia, 
Montenegro, Morocco, Oman, Paraguay, Qatar, Romania, Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovenia, 
Spain and Switzerland.  
</p>
<p>  Regional organizations and national human rights institutions that submitted information were the 
Commonwealth Secretariat; Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe; Ombudsman of 
Bulgaria, Malawi Human Rights Commission, National Human Rights Commission of India, Human 
Rights Commission of New Zealand, Ombudsman of Panama, Office of the Human Rights Defender 
of Poland, National Human Rights Commission of Qatar, South African Human Rights Commission, 
Ombudsman of Venezuela (Bolivar Republic of).  
</p>
<p>  A number of non-governmental organizations submitted information. To the extent that it relates to 
effective measures and best practices, such information has been included in the report. However, 
some submissions contained allegations of violations by States of human rights in the context of 
peaceful protests, such as disproportionate use of force or harassment of protestors. Such information 
has been transmitted to the Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
association for further action, but has not been included in this report.    
</p>
<p> 2 Human Rights Council resolution 19/35 of 23 March 2012. 
 3 See for example, communication No. 1316/2004, <i>Mecheslav Gryb </i>v.<i> Belarus</i>, Views adopted on 26 
</p>
<p>October 2011, para. 9.5. </p>


<p>right to participate in the conduct of public affairs requires the full enjoyment and respect 
for the rights guaranteed in articles 19, 21 and 22 of the Covenant, including, inter alia, 
freedom to hold peaceful demonstrations and meetings (para. 25).   
</p>
<p>5. The rights and freedoms provided for under articles 19 and 21 of the Covenant, 
however, are not absolute and may be subject to restrictions.4 Article 21 states that no 
restrictions may be placed on the exercise of the right to peaceful assembly other than those 
imposed in conformity with the law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the 
interests of national security or public safety, public order (ordre public), the protection of 
public health or morals or the protection of rights and freedoms of others. For instance, the 
Human Rights Committee has found that a requirement to notify the police of an intended 
demonstration in a public place six hours before its commencement may be compatible 
with the permitted limitations laid down in article 21.5 
</p>
<p>6. Similarly, under article 19, paragraph 3, the right to freedom of expression may be 
subject to restrictions only as provided by law and necessary for respect of the rights or 
reputations of others, or the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public) 
or of public health or morals. In its general comment No. 34 (2011), the Human Rights 
Committee further explains that any restrictions on the exercise of such freedoms &#8220;must 
conform to the strict tests of necessity and proportionality&#8221; and &#8220;be applied only for those 
purposes for which they were prescribed and must be directly related to the specific need on 
which they are predicated&#8221; (para. 22). In the context of an individual communication, the 
Committee pointed out that although general comment No. 34 refers to article 19, it also 
provides guidance with regard to elements of article 21.6 
</p>
<p>7. According to the Committee`s jurisprudence, it is up to the State party to show that  
restrictions on an author&#8217;s right under article 19, paragraph 3, of the Covenant are necessary 
and that even if a State party introduces a system aiming to strike a balance between an 
individual&#8217;s freedom to impart information and the general interest in maintaining public 
order in a certain area, such a system must not operate in a way that is incompatible with 
article 19 of the Covenant.7 
</p>
<p><b> III. Special procedures 
</b></p>
<p>8. In his initial report to the Human Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur on the 
rights to freedom of assembly and of association defined the term &#8220;assembly&#8221; as including 
demonstrations, strikes, processions, rallies or even sit-ins. He elaborated on the 
international legal framework applicable to the right to peaceful assembly, including 
restrictions on this right and the relationship between article 21 and other rights set out in 
the Covenant. The Special Rapporteur also stressed the obligation of Member States to both 
facilitate and protect peaceful assemblies, including through negotiation and mediation.8 He 
further noted that the right to freedom of assembly is also reflected in article 8 of the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and in other international 
and regional instruments (para. 14).

<p>9. In their joint contribution to this report, the Special Rapporteurs on the rights to 
freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, on the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, and on the situation of human rights defenders pointed out that States should 
recognize the positive role of peaceful protests as a means of strengthening human rights 
and democracy. They should guarantee the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, freedom 
of association, and freedom of opinion and expression, which are essential components of 
democracy and indispensable to the full enjoyment of all human rights. In far too many 
instances, these rights have been unduly restricted or plainly denied in the context of 
peaceful protests. 
</p>
<p>10. Indeed, only protests that are peaceful are protected by international human rights 
law. An assembly should be deemed peaceful if its organizers and participants have 
peaceful intentions and do not use, advocate or incite violence; such features should be 
presumed. Assembly organizers should not be held liable for the violent behaviour 
committed by others. Instead, police have the duty to remove violent individuals from the 
crowd in order to allow protesters to exercise their basic rights to assemble and express 
themselves peacefully. 
</p>
<p>11. The organization of a protest should not be subject to prior authorization from the 
administrative authorities of the State, but at the most to a prior notification procedure, the 
rationale of which is to allow State authorities to facilitate the exercise of the right to 
freedom of peaceful assembly and to take appropriate measures to protect public safety and 
order and the rights and freedoms of protesters and other individuals affected by the 
protests. Spontaneous and simultaneous assemblies should be regulated by the same 
procedure and should also be protected. In any case, organizers should not be criminalized 
for not requesting an authorization. 
</p>
<p>12. When restricting the rights to freedoms of peaceful assembly, of opinion and 
expression, and of association, the least intrusive means of achieving the legitimate 
objective pursued by the authorities should always be given preference. Freedom to hold 
and participate in peaceful protests is to be considered the rule, and limitations thereto 
considered the exception. In this regard, the protection of the rights and freedoms of others 
should not be used as an excuse to limit the exercise of peaceful protests. Complete 
prohibition involving blanket bans on time and location does not comply with human rights 
in the context of peaceful protests, unless it is a measure of last resort, adopted to protect 
lives. </p>
<p>13. The dispersal of assemblies should only be a measure of last resort. Law 
enforcement authorities should not resort to force during peaceful assemblies, and they 
should ensure that force is only used on an exceptional basis.   
</p>
<p>14. According to article 4, paragraph 2, of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, the right to life and the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment are non-derogable rights. As such, it is imperative that 
States ensure prompt and adequate medical care for any person injured during a peaceful 
protest and that the injured person as well as his or her relatives are protected from any 
threat of reprisal.   
</p>
<p>15. No one should be criminalized or subjected to any threats or acts of violence, 
harassment, persecution, intimidation or reprisals for addressing human rights issues 
through peaceful protest or for reporting on human rights violations and abuses committed 
in the context of peaceful protests. The protection of women, especially women human 
rights defenders, must be guaranteed. Instances of gender-based violence occurring during 
demonstrations should be investigated and prosecuted as a matter of priority. </p>
<p>16. States must also ensure that anyone monitoring and reporting on violations and 
abuses occurring during peaceful protests, including journalists, community media workers, </p>


<p>other media professionals and bloggers, do so without fear of intimidation, legal and 
physical harassment and violence. In this regard, the State has an obligation to protect them. 
</p>
<p>17. States have the obligation to ensure that law enforcement officials are sufficiently 
trained and equipped, particularly with regard to crowd control and the use of force. In this 
regard, reference should be made to the comprehensive work carried out by the 
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe Office for Democratic Institutions 
and Human Rights (OSCE/ODIHR) and its Panel of Experts on Freedom of Peaceful 
Assembly. 
</p>
<p>18. Human rights defenders coalitions, national, regional and international networks for 
communication of information, monitoring groups and support groups that could provide a 
safe haven should be promoted and strengthened. These groups can provide protection for 
peaceful protesters as well as those monitoring peaceful protests. 
</p>
<p>19. Any reported excessive use of force or other human rights violations in the context 
of peaceful protests should be investigated and prosecuted promptly, impartially and in an 
independent manner, in order to bring perpetrators to justice.<b> </b>This not only entails 
guarantees that the violation be addressed, but also that it will not be repeated in the future. 
Where human rights in the context of peaceful protests are unduly restricted, the victim(s) 
should have the right to obtain redress and to fair and adequate compensation. Specific 
attention must be paid to victims belonging to the groups most at risk in this process. </p>
<p>20. In his contribution to this report, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary 
or arbitrary executions made reference to article 6, paragraph 1, of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights regarding the right to life, and recalled that in its 
general comment No. 6 (1982) on the right to life, the Human Rights Committee considers 
that States parties should take measures to, inter alia, &#8220;prevent arbitrary killing by their own 
security forces.&#8221; In its view, the deprivation of life by the authorities of the State is a matter 
of utmost gravity, therefore, the law must strictly control and limit the circumstances in 
which a person may be deprived of his life by such authorities (para. 3). Moreover, the 
Special Rapporteur referred to the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by 
Law Enforcement Officials,9 in particular principles 9, 12, 13 and 14, and to the Code of 
Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials10 which provides an interpretation of the limits on 
the conduct of law enforcement forces.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur also referred to his report to the seventeenth session of the 
Human Rights Council, where he concluded, based on a study of some 76 countries, that 
many domestic legal systems do not adhere to international standards in respect of the use 
of force during demonstrations (A/HRC/17/28, summary). The Special Rapporteur also 
highlighted several interconnected factors that shape a State&#8217;s response to protest and the 
eventual consequences. The recognition by the State of the right to peaceful assembly, both 
at the political and legal levels, is a crucial element. When the right to peaceful assembly is 
suppressed, there is a higher risk for demonstrations to escalate and turn violent. However, 
thorough respect by the State of the right to peaceful assembly offers the opportunity to 
defuse tensions and avoid negative consequences, such as potential loss of life.  
</p>
<p>22. In his report, the Special Rapporteur also underlines the need for greater codification 
of international law applicable to demonstrations, recommending that &#8220;the basic principles 
for managing demonstrations should be elaborated more clearly, so as to set out the 
international law standards applicable to demonstrations (non-violent and violent; legal and 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Offenders, Havana, 27 August to 7 September 1990. 
 10  Adopted by General Assembly resolution 34/169 of 17 December 1979. </p>


<p>illegal), with special reference to the use of (deadly) force by the police during 
demonstrations. [&#8230;] This process is important, not only in terms of providing clarity on the 
applicable standards, but also in order to raise awareness and solicit collaboration for a 
global law reform effort in respect of assembly rights&#8221; (para. 143). 
</p>
<p>23. Beyond legal frameworks, management of demonstrations, in practice, also requires 
knowledge of crowd behavior, adequate equipment &#8211; including a range of less-than-lethal 
weapons &#8211; and appropriate training of law enforcement officials, including in human rights. 
The latter play an important role in ensuring that responses to protests do not lead to 
escalated violence and human rights violations, including loss of life. 
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions also made 
reference to a so-called &#8220;negotiated management&#8221; approach to the process of policing 
assemblies. According to this approach, the task of the police is to protect rights and  
facilitate, rather than frustrate, demonstrations; they should help to diffuse tension and 
prevent a dangerous escalation of the situation. Several countries that follow this approach 
have also formalized the role of the so-called &#8220;safety triangle&#8221; during demonstrations, based 
on continuous communication and interaction between the organizers of the protest, the 
local or State authorities and the police, aimed at averting risks and ensuring smooth 
management of the assembly. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. National legislation, effective measures and best practices  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Relevant national legislation 
</b></p>
<p>25. All States which provided input for this report indicated that the right to peaceful 
assembly, which in some cases also makes reference to peaceful protest or demonstration, 
is protected by the Constitution, specific legislation or both.   
</p>
<p>26. Costa Rica observed that peaceful protest is used as a means to gather support from 
civil society and the State on issues that affect those demonstrating, and is part of the 
exercise of an active and participatory democracy. According to its Constitutional Court, 
peaceful demonstrations are a manifestation of freedom of expression which enjoy judicial 
protection.11   
</p>
<p>27. The Mongolian Constitution protects citizens&#8217; freedom to peaceful demonstration 
and assemblies. Mongolia also has a Law on Procedures to Organize Demonstrations and 
Assemblies. 
</p>
<p>28. Switzerland indicated that the freedom to protest is essential in a State based on the 
freedom of its citizens, and that this right is protected through provisions on freedom of 
opinion and information, as well as freedom of association in the federal Constitution. 
</p>
<p>29. Spain noted that its Constitution recognizes the right of assembly and peaceful 
protest without use of any weapons. It added that peaceful protest is legally characterized as 
a collective demonstration of the freedom of expression by means of a temporary assembly 
of persons whose purpose is to exchange or expose certain ideas, defend specific interests 
or publicize problems or demands. Spain also stressed the close relationship in law between 
the right of peaceful assembly and the right of freedom of expression.12 
</p>
<p>  
 11 Costa Rica, Constitutional Court, judgement No. 03020 (2000). 
 12 Spain, Constitutional Court, sentencia 96/2010 of 15 November 2010, FJ 3. </p>


<p>30. Similarly, the constitutions of Bulgaria, Guatemala, Panama, Paraguay and 
Venezuela (Bolivian Republic of) protect the right to peaceful assembly and demonstration, 
while explicitly stressing that this right should be exercised without recourse to &#8220;arms&#8221;. The 
constitutions of Qatar and Bahrain protect the right to peaceful assembly, and both States 
have also adopted national legislation banning the use of arms during assemblies. 
</p>
<p>31. Serbia indicated that the right to peaceful assembly is laid down in its Constitution 
and that during peaceful protests, citizens&#8217; rights to freedom of thought and expression are 
protected. Mauritius stated that peaceful protests are protected by two different 
constitutional provisions: the right to freedom of expression and the right to freedom of 
assembly and association. 
</p>
<p>32. The Estonian Constitution states that everyone has the right, without prior 
permission, to assemble peacefully and hold meetings.  However, it also provides for 
restriction to this right pursuant to a procedure provided by law to ensure national security, 
public order, morals, traffic safety and the safety of participants in a meeting, or to prevent 
the spread of an infectious disease.13   
</p>
<p>33. Guatemala reported that the right to peaceful assembly may be restricted in certain 
cases established in the Law on Public Order, taking into account the provisions of article 
21 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In order to ensure peace, 
security and the effective implementation of human rights, the Civil Security Forces 
Support Act regulates the support provided by the Guatemalan armed forces to civil 
security forces when working to prevent and combat organized and minor crimes.14 In 
November 2012, a Protocol on Inter-agency Action: Military Support to Civil Security 
Forces, specifying the legal framework for assistance, cooperation and coordination 
between the Guatemalan armed and civil security forces, was adopted.15  
</p>
<p><b> B.  Measures and best practices  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Prior notification and authorization 
</b></p>
<p>34. While some States do not require any prior notification or prior authorization to hold 
peaceful demonstrations, others may require one or the other. In certain situations, prior 
notification or authorization is only required if the organizers intend to use public roads or 
public areas, or when special facilities, such as stands or barriers, may have to be erected 
for the demonstration.  
</p>
<p>35. Similarly, States diverge on approaches to spontaneous peaceful protests. Some 
States which require prior notification or authorization may ban such demonstrations, 
others may allow them, or others still may allow the demonstration even if it contravenes 
legal requirements rergarding prior notification or authorization.  
</p>
<p>36. In Azerbaijan, notification must include the name, purpose, place and date of the 
event, the approximate number of participants, and if a street march is held, its proposed 
route, including starting place, distance and destination, as well as the name and contact 
information of the organizers. However, spontaneous demonstrations or protests do not 
require written notification, but can be restricted or stopped.16

<p>37. In Estonia, the Public Meetings Act states that an organized public meeting has to be 
registered at least four working days prior to the meeting at the rural municipality or city 
government, when it is necessary to redirect traffic, erect a tent, stage, bleacher or any other 
large-scale construction, or use sound or lighting equipment. All other public meetings have 
to be registered with the police at least two hours prior to the meeting. Public meetings 
cannot be held in certain places, including, inter alia, at border checkpoints or closer than 
300 metres to the border, on Estonian defence forces territory or closer than 50 metres to 
defence forces territory, on bridges, the railroad, in a mine, under high-voltage power lines, 
an area where infectious disease is spreading or that is dangerous to persons. 
</p>
<p>38. The Democratic Republic of the Congo indicated that all public demonstrations must 
obtain prior authorization from the competent administrative authorities, as State authorities 
have the obligation to ensure security for protestors and maintain public order. The 
Democratic Republic of the Congo further indicated that although spontaneous 
demonstrations are illegal, they are nevertheless subject to the protection of State 
authorities in order to maintain public order.   
</p>
<p>39. The Republic of Moldova indicated that, further to legislative amendments in 2008, 
it now has a notification procedure for assemblies, rather than an authorization system. 
According to the Law on Assemblies, any assembly with fewer than 50 participants can 
take place without prior notification. In the event that the assembly involves more than 50 
people, the organizers must notify the local authorities five days prior to the event in order 
to ensure that no other assemblies have been organized in the same place at the same time. 
The Republic of Moldova indicated that the change from an authorization to a notification 
system has led to an increase in the number of assemblies held and the number of 
individuals exercising their right to freedom of peaceful assembly. 
</p>
<p>40. In Qatar, Law No. 18/2004 on public meetings and demonstrations stipulates that 
organizers of meetings or peaceful assemblies must obtain a licence from the Director 
General of Public Security by submitting a written request seven days prior to the proposed 
date of the event. The application is considered rejected if approval is not given three days 
prior to the proposed date of the event. The organizers can request a review of the refusal 
by the Ministry of Interior within 24 hours. If the Ministry does not respond to the review 
request, it should be considered a rejection. The National Human Rights Commission of 
Qatar stated, however, that it has observed spontaneous peaceful protests by labourers 
protesting against delays in payment of their salaries by companies. The Ministry of 
Interior placed no restrictions on the protests, and only posted officers at the site of the 
protests to ensure they were peaceful. In Oman, an administrative coordination unit 
between relevant public authorities has been mandated to receive requests for authorization 
to hold peaceful protests and provides technical advice on these requests to the unit chief. 
</p>
<p>41. In Serbia, the Law on the Assembly of Citizens requires the organizer to submit an 
application to hold a public assembly to the Ministry of the Interior at least 48 hours prior 
to said assembly, and five days, in the case of movement, for example, a march by 
participants. 
</p>
<p>42. Spain stated that according to its Constitution, the holding of a peaceful assembly 
does not require any prior authorization.17 Organic Law 9/1983 regulates assemblies and 
demonstrations held in places where there is public transit. Organizers must inform the 
competent public authorities in writing a minimum of 10 days in advance, except for urgent 
reasons, in which case the authorities may be informed in writing a minimum of 24 hours in 
advance. The competent public authorities may prohibit a demonstration or propose 
</p>
<p>  
 17 Spain, Constitution (1978), art. 21. </p>


<p>modification of the itinerary or the time of the public gathering, if it considers that the event 
may pose a threat to public order or danger to persons or property. The decision of the 
public authorities can be appealed before an administrative body within 48 hours in the 
presence of all parties and prior to the date of the planned event. The decision of the 
administrative tribunal can be appealed before the Constitutional Court.  
</p>
<p>43. In Switzerland, the right to demonstrate in public spaces derives from the rights to 
freedom of expression and freedom of assembly as protected under the federal 
Constitution.18 However, demonstrations may be subject to prior authorization, if provided 
for by law, to coordinate the use of public areas and to guarantee public safety. 
Management of public areas falls within the competence of the cantonal and communal 
authorities. In the cantons of Bern, Geneva and Graub&#252;nden, the organizers of 
demonstrations are reqired to obtain prior authorization to hold demonstrations. In practice, 
however, the procedure functions like a notification system, as demonstrations are almost 
never prohibited. Spontaneous demonstrations are not subject to a prior authorization 
procedure in Switzerland. Refusal by the competent authorities to grant authorization for a 
peaceful protest may be appealed before the first instance jurisdiction at the commune 
level; the Federal Tribunal would be the final national court to hear an appeal. 
</p>
<p>44. The Commonwealth Secretariat highlighted that &#8220;authorities must be notified of a 
proposed demonstration or protest unless the circumstances are such that prior notification 
is not possible; authorities have no authority to stop a demonstration or protest, but may 
stipulate reasonable conditions to safeguard against potential violence; prohibition is a last 
resort, where there is a genuine threat of violence if the event were to take place; judicial 
review is to be made available against decisions of the authorities; organizers are to be 
made aware by the authorities of the conditions of a demonstration or protest and their 
liability for any damages caused.&#8221;19 
</p>
<p>45. The European Court of Human Rights has placed limitations on the dissolution of 
peaceful demonstrations spontaneously organized in response to events that would 
foreseeably result in demonstrations. The Court said that &#8220;in special circumstances when an 
immediate response, in the form of a demonstration, to a political event might be justified, a 
decision to disband the ensuing, peaceful assembly solely because of the absence of the 
requisite prior notice, without any illegal conducts by the participants, amounts to a 
disproportionate restriction on freedom of peaceful assembly.&#8221;20 Moreover, the European 
Court of Human Rights determined that the absence of an effective appeals procedure 
against a decision to forbid an assembly prior to the proposed date of said assembly is a 
violation of the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms.21 
</p>
<p>46. The Defending Dissent Foundation, based in the United States of America, argued 
that notice or permits should not be required for assemblies of less than 50 people, or when 
the protest takes place on public sidewalks, or when the assembly is for the purpose of an 
immediate and spontaneous expression of views in response to a public event.  Lawyers for 
Constitutional Rights and Freedoms (JURIX) advocates that ordinary participants of

</p>
<p>Office of the Human Rights Defender in Poland was involved in the case from the outset, arguing that 
the introduction of a requirement to obtain permission for an assembly on a public road is a violation 
of the freedom of assembly. </p>


<p>peaceful assemblies should not be detained even in cases when regulatory authorities and 
organizers do not reach an agreement about the time, place and manner of the event.  
Peaceful protests should be allowed to be held in front of their intended audience and with 
maximum publicity. The procedure for obtaining the consent of the regulatory authorities, 
including with respect to the time and place of the protest, should not be used as a tool to 
frustrate the purpose of such demonstrations. 
</p>
<p>47. With regard to protests notified to the Copenhagen police, the Danish Institute for 
Human Rights indicated that the police initiates dialogue with the organizers prior to the 
scheduled date to ensure the protest will proceed peacefully. The Zimbabwe Human Rights 
NGO Forum supports legal reform efforts to transfer the power to ban demonstrations from 
the police to the courts, and to remove the obligation for demonstrators to carry identity 
cards. 
</p>
<p>48. In their jurisprudence, regional courts have addressed the issue as to whether 
peaceful protests can be restricted if they take place in public areas or on public roads that 
are used intensively. The argument that closing public roads for demonstrations would 
cause undue inconvenience to others was rejected by the European Court of Human Rights. 
The Court stated that &#8220;any demonstration in a public place inevitably causes a certain level 
of disruption to ordinary life, including disruption of traffic, and that it is important for the 
public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the 
freedom of assembly guaranteed by article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of all 
substance.&#8221;22 The European Court of Justice reached a similar conclusion in a case where a 
protest on a major transit route through the Alps resulted in the effective closure of the 
motorway for almost 30 hours.23 The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights 
(IACHR) also arrived at a similar conclusion.24 
</p>
<p><b>  Role of authorities, in particular the police, during peaceful protests 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Danish Institute for Human Rights reported that the Copenhagen police has 
initiated social media communication as of 2012, and updates protestors and participants in 
public events via Facebook and Twitter with information related to the protest or event. 
Australia reported that police functions in the context of peaceful protests are conducted in 
a manner that respects human rights and freedoms.  
</p>
<p>50. Montenegro stated that the police maintains communication and cooperates with the 
organizers of a peaceful protest during the event, as well as with other entities involved, 
such as agencies providing physical or health protection or the media. Madagascar stressed 
the role of the Ministry of Internal Security and the Police in guaranteeing the free exercise 
of constitutionally guaranteed fundamental freedoms, including peaceful protest. Law 
enforcement forces ensure compliance with rules regarding peaceful protests, while 
maintaining public order before, during and after protests. 
</p>
<p>51. The Australian Castan Centre for Human Rights Law argued that police should wear 
identification at all times so that there may be some recourse if they use disproportionate 
force. It underlined that police should be given guidance in appropriate crowd control 
mechanisms. The Centre raised the issue of police response to civil disobedience. Recalling 
the historical importance of civil disobedience as a form of protest, even though it may not

<p>be protected under either domestic or international human rights law, the Centre advocates 
that punishment for such acts should be proportionate, and that protestors should not be 
held up as examples.  
</p>
<p>52. The Spanish Fundaci&#243;n Intervida emphasized that persons under 18 years of age 
must receive particular protection against violence and inhuman or degrading treatment in 
the context of peaceful demonstrations. 
</p>
<p>53. The Defending Dissent Foundation considers that the role of the police at peaceful 
protests should be crowd management and that communication and voluntary compliance 
should be emphasized. All law enforcement personnel should wear or display visible 
identification and plainclothes or undercover officers or informants should not be placed in 
a crowd. The police presence should not be disproportionate to the size of the crowd, and 
the police should not be armed with lethal weapons. Horses should not be used for crowd 
control, the police should not photograph or videotape peaceful protestors, and should be 
prohibited from making pre-emptive arrests and dispersals. Moreover, law enforcement 
officers should document all arrests and promptly process them; arrested persons should be 
made aware of their legal rights. It advocated that tear gas, pepper spray or other &#8220;less than 
lethal&#8221; weapons should not be used on peaceful demonstrators. 
</p>
<p>54.  The Ombudsman of Panama highlighted the importance of dialogue and 
consultation with all parties involved, which contribute to the protection of human rights 
during peaceful protests. Oman also emphasized the importance of communication with 
public authorities during protests.  
</p>
<p>55. Various NGOs also raised concerns about the misuse of less-than-lethal weapons. 
Specific concerns were raised by Physicians for Human Rights and the Castan Centre for 
Human Rights Law with respect to certain forms of non-lethal weapons used to control 
demonstrations, including guns with rubber bullets, tear gas, birdshot and taser guns. 
Physicians for Human Rights recommended that States ensure access to medical care for 
any injured protestor or security officer, and protect the medical neutrality of health-care 
professionals who treat injured protestors or security officers. 
</p>
<p>56. The Network for Police Monitoring (Netpol) addressed the police tactic of 
containment, or &#8220;kettling,&#8221; of persons, including both protestors and bystanders, for a 
period of several hours, as a crowd-containment measure. The European Court of Human 
Rights found that the use of such containment measures was not a violation of the 
Convention when it is necessary to avert &#8220;a real risk of serious injury or damage,&#8221; and 
where it is the &#8220;least intrusive and most effective means to be applied.&#8221;25 While accepting 
that the police tactic of containment is legal in situations where there is a risk of serious 
violence, Netpol acknowledged that the practice is frequently used as a response to 
spontaneous and unauthorized peaceful protests, and expressed concern that the practice is 
not used only for the narrow purposes for which it is intended. Netpol further alleged that 
police tactics such as containment and stop-and-search are frequently used by police to 
collect personal data on protestors. It argued that the gathering and processing of such data 
does not have an adequate foundation in law and that it has a chilling effect on participation 
in protest activities. 
</p>
<p>57. The Danish Institute for Human Rights raised the issue of the treatment of large 
numbers of persons provisionally detained during protest activities in Denmark, 
highlighting one case in which the detainees did not have access to toilet facilities and were 
left on the cold pavement for several hours.<b> </b>

<p>58. The Commonwealth Secretariat26 advocates that police present during protests 
should apply the principles of proportionality, legality, accountability and necessity 
(PLAN). The Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
association expressed the view that organizers of protests should not incur any financial 
charges for the provision of public services during an assembly, nor should assembly 
organizers and participants be considered responsible (or held liable) for the unlawful 
conduct of others or made responsible for the maintenance of public order.27  
</p>
<p><b>  Investigations of violence and accountability 
</b></p>
<p>59. The National Human Rights Commission of India and the South African Human 
Rights Commission both indicated that their role is to investigate and make findings and 
recommendations when protests result in serious violence, including deaths. They also 
indicated that their institutions should engage in public dialogue on the issues that lead to 
demonstrations and human rights issues arising from protest activities.  
</p>
<p>60. The Malawi Human Rights Commission stated that it had conducted an 
investigation into demonstrations in July 2011 that had turned violent and resulted in the 
death of 19 people as well as destruction of property. The Ombudsman of Venezuela 
(Bolivar Republic of) indicated that it tries to mediate conflicts arising from peaceful 
protests and makes recommendations to the competent bodies of the State for possible 
action. 
</p>
<p>61. Physicians for Human Rights urged States to establish fair and transparent 
accountability mechanisms for security forces who have engaged in the excessive use of 
force against peaceful protesters, and to conduct impartial and independent investigations 
of any allegations of harassment or intimidation of protestors. Turkey reported that where 
the authorities find that a disproportionate use of force is used by security forces during 
peaceful protests or where such complaints are received, the Ministry of the Interior assigns 
inspectors to investigate such incidents, in accordance with its &#8220;zero tolerance policy 
</p>
<p>towards torture and ill-treatment.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>62. The Russian Federation referred to two bodies created in recent years, which are 
functioning successfully in identifying human rights violations, including in the context of 
peaceful protest. Public oversight councils have been established and they communicate 
cases of serious abuses of human rights that are also the object of attention by civil society 
organizations. The Public Council of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs comprises 
representatives of the human rights community and addresses cases of human rights abuses. 
Oman reported that its National Human Rights Institution is monitoring and providing 
advice on all issues related to human rights violations, including violations of human rights 
in the context of peaceful protests. 
</p>
<p>63. Greenpeace addressed the issue of civil disobedience, which it characterizes as 
deliberate non-compliance with a legal requirement. It argued that legitimate and 
constructive protest should not always be subject to legal sanction, even if it violates the 
law. It referred to a case where 46 Greenpeace activists had intentionally violated the law to 
illustrate that security was inadequate at a nuclear facility in Australia; they were initially 
convicted of trespass, but on appeal, the convictions were set aside. The presiding judge 
stated that &#8220;[&#8230;] it was not the case, in my view, that the objectives and motives of the 
defendants could have been achieved by demonstrating at the front gate. As has already

<p>been noted [&#8230;], one of the major objectives and motives of the appellants was that the 
woeful security inherent in the facility should be demonstrated in graphic terms.&#8221; 28  
</p>
<p><b>  Good practices contributing to impartiality of the State 
</b></p>
<p>64. The impartiality of the State has been identified by the National Human Rights 
Commission of India as being of central importance in the exercise of the right of peaceful 
protest. The Commission indicated how, in a variety of situations, a lack of impartiality 
could adversely affect the right of peaceful protest. For example, the government in power  
may encourage and even support pro-government demonstrations, but forbid, restrict or 
disrupt peaceful protest by the political opposition and individuals or groups dissatisfied 
with government policies and practices. A State may also target persons supporting subjects 
that are viewed as controversial or incompatible with mainstream values or beliefs, or 
inflict heavy fines on organizers, participants or opposition leaders who participate in such 
protests, or subject them to detention or imprisonment. In extreme cases, governments may 
commit serious human rights violations such as torture or ill treatment of persons in 
custody, or try to obstruct medical care to those who are injured. 
</p>
<p>65. A variety of good practices can contribute to addressing lack of impartiality by the 
State. For instance, national human rights institutions can conduct investigations into a 
State&#8217;s impartiality in a given instance and publicly report on their findings. The South 
African Human Rights Commission, the Office of the Human Rights Defender of Poland 
and the Office of the Ombudsman of Bulgaria reported that they play a role in monitoring 
protests and engaging in dialogue with relevant stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>66. Adverse decisions of administrative authorities, prohibiting or restricting peaceful 
protest, should be appealable before independent and impartial bodies, including courts. 
Media organizations should be allowed to carry out their work freely and to report without 
restrictions on demonstrations. NGOs and human right defenders have a role to play in 
monitoring peaceful assemblies and their policing,29 and observers from diplomatic 
missions, regional and international organizations may also play a role in monitoring 
demonstrations when the impartiality of the State is put into question. In this respect, 
OSCE/ODIHR&#8217;s <i>Handbook on Monitoring Freedom of Peaceful Assembly</i> (2011) can be 
used to build capacity. 
</p>
<p><b>  The role of the media 
</b></p>
<p>67. Reporters Without Borders stated that the media play a key role during peaceful 
protests in promoting the full and effective exercise of the right to freedom of peaceful 
assembly. It underlined that media coverage of demonstrations and public gatherings 
represented one of the principal reasons for exactions against journalists, and noted an 
increase in aggressions against journalists in 2011. Detention, questioning or convocation 
by authorities have been used to restrain the free flow of information, as well as violence, 
destruction of material, confiscation of recordings, assaults on media offices, expulsions or 
denial of visas.  
</p>
<p>68. It recommended that media coverage be recognized as an element of protection of 
human rights in the context of peaceful protests; that the right to information should not be 
conditioned on the holding of a press card or press accreditation; that States respect the 
right to information and recognize the right of journalists to have access to places of public 
protest, to film and interview; that they have respect for the physical security of journalists 
</p>

<p>(unpublished), p. 5.  
 29 See A/HRC/20/27, para. 50. </p>


<p>as well as their material and for fundamental principles, such as the confidentiality of their 
sources. States should prohibit the refusal to issue visas or to give accreditation to 
journalists, as well as their expulsion; police forces should respect the neutrality of 
journalists and should receive training on respect for international norms on freedom of 
information and respect for the work of the media during demonstrations. In addition, the 
State should effectively combat impunity for exaction against journalists by systematically 
prosecuting those responsible for criminal acts and imposing disciplinary measures. 
</p>
<p>69. The organization ARTICLE 19 also underlined the role of the media, arguing that 
attacks on journalists and &#8220;citizen journalists&#8221; covering assemblies should be regarded as a 
</p>
<p>violation of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly as well as the right to freedom of 
expression. It cited the judgement of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in a case 
concerning an attack on a video journalist who was attempting to film a demonstration. The 
Court concluded that disseminating information about such protests enables those who see 
it &#8220;to observe and verify whether, during the demonstration, the members of the armed 
</p>
<p>forces were performing their duties correctly, with an appropriate use of force.&#8221;30 
</p>
<p><b>  New technologies 
</b></p>
<p>70. New technologies, such as the Internet, e-mail, text messaging, Twitter, Facebook, 
as well as mobile phones, have changed the way people peacefully protest, and have also 
challenged traditional notions about what is a peaceful assembly.31 ARTICLE 19 noted that 
in 2010, the United States of America Secretary of State analogized online platforms as the 
modern town square for the purpose of assemblies and argued that the right to freedom of 
peaceful assembly applies to online protests.  
</p>
<p>71. The Association for Progressive Communications (APC) observed that new forms of 
online protests are not well covered by national legislation and human rights law. Legally 
permitted online protest remains to be defined. APC referred to distributed denial-of-
service (DDoS) attacks, an often-used form of online protest. DDoS attacks involve the 
continuous flooding of a website by many users with useless information, which can cause 
the website to slow down or go offline due to server overload. APC noted that a DDoS 
attack can be an act of protest and could be considered the online version of a sit-in. A 
DDoS attack will usually make a website unavailable for a short time until the attacks cease 
&#8211; similar to protesters outside a building stopping business activities for a limited period 
until the protest ceases. Such attacks alone do not generally compromise the security of a 
site or allow for stealing information, unless the target site is hacked and exploited while it 
is weakened. A German court ruled that DDoS attacks could, depending on the purpose of 
the attack, be considered a legitimate form of protest, and not a crime. APC stated that the 
law needed to draw a distinction between DDoS attacks for protest activities and attacks 
conducted by &#8220;botnets&#8221; controlled by hackers which harm both their targets and the 
unwilling owners of zombie machines used in botnet attacks. APC said that people using 
DDoS tools should be assessed differently from those using botnets.

</p>
<p>Objection, Merits, Reparations, and Costs. judgement of September 3, 2012. Series C No. 248. 
 31 See A/HRC/20/27, para. 32. The Special Rapporteur also underlined that human rights in the context 
</p>
<p>of peaceful protests should apply both offline and online, and agreed with the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression that all States should 
ensure that Internet access is maintained at all times, including during times of political unrest, (para. 
84(k)).  </p>


<p><b>  Training and guidance 
</b></p>
<p>72. A number of States32 and national human rights institutions indicated that they 
provide human rights training to administrative authorities and/or the police as a measure to 
promote and protect human rights in the context of peaceful protests.    
</p>
<p>73. Azerbaijan mentioned that its training programmes included such topics as the role 
of the police during demonstrations; demonstrations as manifestation of the principle of 
democracy; cooperation among organizers and police; chain police activity; strategies for 
decreasing tension; managing various gatherings; managing mass disorder; regulating roads 
and other places; and respect for and protection of human dignity. 
</p>
<p>74. Paraguay reported that the <i>Manual on the Use of Force</i>, issued by the National 
Police in 2011, was an important action to promote and protect the right of peaceful protest. 
Slovenia indicated that it provides training to the police with the objective of giving law 
enforcement officers an advanced knowledge of constitutional law and human rights, 
including human rights protection when police powers are used. It also has a special 
training programme entitled &#8220;Awareness of stereotypes, overcoming prejudice and 
</p>
<p>prevention of discrimination in a multi-cultural society.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>75. Turkey stated that the Directive on the Procedure and Principles Relating to the 
Conduct of Personnel in Charge during Assembly and Demonstration Marches was adopted 
in 2011 with a view to providing nationwide uniformity, including with respect to the 
degree of force used to ensure proportionality. 
</p>
<p><b>  Research activities 
</b></p>
<p>76. Hungary&#8217;s Office of the Commissioner for Fundamental Rights has undertaken a 
project on the freedom of assembly which includes an investigation of how law 
enforcement handles reports and how far the measures taken during events meet the 
requirements set by the Constitution and applicable legal regulations. Since its launch, more 
than 150 events have been investigated. It found that demonstrations are more often 
crossing national boundaries, and demonstration tactics are changing and developing. 
Based on the conclusion that police expertise needed to become international, a project was 
initiated with 20 partner organizations from 11 countries, including law enforcement 
organs, research and educational institutions, the national police and the Commissioner for 
Fundamental Rights.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>77.<b> Peaceful protests are a fundamental aspect of a vibrant democracy. States 
should recognize the positive role of peaceful protests as a means to strengthen human
