</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming </i>the relevant articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and

recognition as a person before the law, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>Commission on Human Rights resolution 20 (XXXVI) of 29 February 
1980, in which the Commission established a working group to examine questions relevant 
to enforced or involuntary disappearances, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>all previous resolutions on enforced or involuntary disappearances of 
the Council, the Commission on Human Rights and the General Assembly, the most recent 
being Council resolution 10/10 of 26 March 2009 and Assembly resolution 64/167 of 18 
December 2009, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling further </i>General Assembly resolution 47/133 of 18 December 1992, in

</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging </i>the adoption of the International Convention for the Protection of

</p>
<p>as possible through its ratification by twenty States, and its implementation, will be a 
significant contribution to ending impunity and to the promotion and protection of all 
human rights for all, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> Council resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the United Nations 
Human Rights Council and 5/2 on the code of conduct for special procedures mandate 
holders of the Council, of 18 June 2007, stressing that all mandate holders shall discharge 
their duties in accordance with these resolutions and the annexes thereto, and urging all 
States to cooperate with and assist the special procedures in the performance of their tasks, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned </i>by the high number of cases of enforced or involuntary 
disappearance around the world, including arrest, detention and abduction, when these are 
part of or amount to enforced disappearances, and by the growing number of reports 
concerning harassment, ill-treatment and intimidation of witnesses of disappearances or 
relatives of persons who have disappeared, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the importance of the right of victims to know the truth regarding the 
circumstances of the enforced disappearance, the progress and results of the investigation 
and the fate of the disappeared person, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also</i> that no one shall be held in secret detention, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that enforced disappearance has special consequences for vulnerable 
groups, especially women and children, as they most often bear the serious economic 
hardships which usually accompany a disappearance and, when they are subjected to 
disappearance themselves, they may become particularly vulnerable to sexual and other 
forms of violence, 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging </i>that acts of enforced disappearance may amount to crimes against 
humanity as defined in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the Set of Principles for the protection and promotion of human rights 
through action to combat impunity (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1997/20/Rev.1, annex II), and taking 
note with appreciation of the updated version of those principles (E/CN.4/2005/102/Add.1), 
<i> Commemorating </i>the thirtieth anniversary of the establishment of the Working Group 
on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, and taking this opportunity to raise awareness 
about enforced disappearance and to call for the prevention and eradication of this crime, 
</p>
<p> 1.<i> Takes note </i>of the most recent report submitted by the Working Group on 
Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances (A/HRC/13/31 and Corr.1) and of the comments 
and recommendations contained therein; 
</p>
<p> 2.<i> Calls upon </i>the Governments that have not provided substantive replies 
concerning claims of enforced disappearances in their countries to do so and to give due 
consideration to relevant recommendations concerning this subject made by the Working 
Group in its reports; 
</p>
<p> 3.<i> Calls upon</i> Governments to offer support to all victims of enforced 
disappearances, especially women and children affected by this crime; 
</p>
<p> 4.<i> Also calls upon</i> Governments to prevent the occurrence of enforced 
disappearances, including by guaranteeing that any person deprived of liberty is held solely 
in officially recognized and supervised places of detention, guaranteeing access to all places 
of detention by authorities and institutions whose competence in this regard has been 
recognized by the concerned State, maintaining official, accessible, up-to-date registers 
and/or records of detainees, and ensuring that detainees are brought before a judicial 
authority promptly after detention; </p>


<p>GE.10-14322 <b>3 
</b></p>
<p> 5.<i> Urges</i> Governments to continue their efforts to elucidate the fate of 
disappeared persons and to ensure that competent authorities in charge of investigation and 
prosecution are provided with adequate means and resources to resolve cases and bring 
perpetrators to justice, including after considering the establishment, where appropriate, of 
specific judicial mechanisms or truth and reconciliation commissions that complement the 
justice system; 
 6.<i> Requests </i>the Secretary-General to ensure that the Working Group receives all 
the assistance and resources it requires to perform its mandate; 
</p>
<p> 7.<i> Welcomes </i>the fact that eighty-three States have signed the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and eighteen 
States have ratified or acceded to it, and calls upon States that have not yet done so to 
consider signing and ratifying the Convention as a matter of priority, as well as to consider 
the option provided for in articles 31 and 32 of the Convention regarding the Committee on 
Enforced Disappearances, with a view to its entry into force by September 2010; 
</p>
<p> 8.<i> Invites </i>States to consider joining all efforts to share information on best 
practices and to work towards the early entry into force of the Convention with the aim of 
its universality; 
</p>
<p> 9.<i> Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to organize, within existing resources, a one-day event to commemorate the thirtieth 
anniversary of the Working Group; 
</p>
<p> 10.<i> Encourages</i> the General Assembly to proclaim 30 August the International 
Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearances; 
</p>
<p> 11.<i> Requests</i> the Working Group to prepare a report for submission to the Human 
Rights Council at its sixteenth session on best practices on enforced disappearances in 
domestic criminal legislation based on inputs solicited from member States; 
</p>
<p> 12.<i> Also requests</i> the Working Group to pay particular attention to the situation 
of women victims of enforced or involuntary disappearances through its activities; 
</p>
<p> 13.<i> Decides </i>to continue consideration of the matter in conformity with its 
programme of work.
