</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In resolution 8/7, the Human Rights Council requested the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to organize a two-day consultation, 
bringing together the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of 
human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, business 
representatives and all relevant stakeholders, including non-governmental organizations and 
representatives of victims of corporate abuse, to discuss ways and means to operationalize 
the &#8220;Protect, Respect, Remedy&#8221; framework on business and human rights put forward by 
the Special Representative. 
</p>
<p>2. The consultation itself featured multi-stakeholder panel discussions about selected 
topics related to each of the pillars of the Special Representative&#8217;s framework. In addition 
to the formal session, and to secure the highest degree of inclusivity and diversity of views 
and opinions, all participants were given the opportunity to organize side events in order to 
draw attention to any relevant issues of their choice. 
</p>
<p>3. The following side events were organized: 
</p>
<p> (a) &#8220;Investment agreements and human rights&#8221; organized by the Special 
Representative John Ruggie; 
</p>
<p> (b) &#8220;The OECD Guidelines: A tool for operationalizing the business and human 
rights framework?&#8221; organized by OECD Watch; 
</p>
<p> (c) &#8220;Global Justice: European Transnational Corporations versus Human Rights&#8221; 
by Bi-regional Network Europe-Latin America and the Caribbean Enlazando Alternativas 
and the Permanent People&#8217;s Tribunal; 
</p>
<p> (d) <i>American Outrage</i>, a documentary shown by Julie Cavanaugh Bill, Western 
Shoshone Defense Project; 
 (e) &#8220;Follow the money: How companies are impacting human rights&#8221; organized 
by Business and Human Rights Resource Centre and Global Witness; 
</p>
<p> (f) &#8220;National human rights institutions&#8217; role in business and human rights&#8221; by 
the ICC Working Group on Business and Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>4. This addendum features summaries of the proceedings of the side events provided 
by the organizers themselves. 
</p>
<p>5. In general, the side events were well attended and triggered important discussions 
and points relevant for the operationalization of the framework of the Special 
Representative. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Investment agreements and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>6. To discuss the Special Representative&#8217;s work on bilateral investment treaties (BITS) 
and host Government agreements (HGAs), three experts with very different but 
complementary experience shared the Panel with the Special Representative. St&#233;phane 
Brabant, a Paris-based lawyer who has 30 years of experience in extractive projects in 
Africa, offered his views on the relevance and importance of the Responsible Contracting 
project being pursued by the Special Representative. He stated that the outcome will 
potentially offer a practical tool to negotiators and contract drafters who rarely know the 
social situation on the ground or have a grasp of the human rights risks of projects. Another 
panellist was Dominic Ayine, a professor of international investment and trade law and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/29/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-12942 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>Executive Director of a non-governmental organization representing the rights of local 
communities in relation to mining projects in Ghana. Professor Ayine offered the audience 
a sample of stabilization clauses promulgated into law in Ghana in favour of investors and 
described the constitutional challenge to such laws. Herbert McLeod, Adviser to the 
President in Sierra Leone, described both the conflict of interest that is often present in the 
negotiation of long-term investment contracts and the difficulty of ensuring those contracts 
represent the public interest and the development interests of the Government. 
</p>
<p>7. The session was very well attended and there was active participation from the 
audience. After a short introduction by the panellists, there was a lively question and 
answer period in which discussions focused on a wide range of issues including corruption, 
transparency of contracts and the need for the international investment regime as a whole to 
integrate concern for human rights. 
</p>
<p>8. The Special Representative described the problem with BITS and stabilization 
clauses as symptomatic of the practice of Governments to tie their own hands so that 
fulfilling their human rights obligations is more difficult or even impossible. He said the 
Mandate would continue to investigate the issue of BITS and host Government agreements 
aiming to provide useful outputs for all parties concerned.  
</p>
<p><b> III. The OECD Guidelines: A tool for operationalizing the 
business and human rights framework 
</b></p>
<p>9. OECD Watch organized a side event that was aimed at exploring whether and how 
the OECD Guidelines could be employed to operationalize the framework for business and 
human rights proposed by the Special Representative, and how the framework can help 
improve the OECD Guidelines during the upcoming review in 2010. After a welcome and 
introductory comments by the chairperson, Richard Howitt (member of the European 
Parliament and European Parliament spokesperson on Corporate Social Responsibility), 
Joseph Wilde-Ramsing (OECD watch coordinator) introduced the aims of the event and 
provided participants with some context about the current poor functioning of the OECD 
Guidelines and most National Contact Points (NCPs). Rashmi Venkatestan, Samson 
Mokoena and Victor Ricco were then invited to provide a perspective on the experiences 
with the OECD Guidelines in Argentina, South Africa and India, respectively. Caroline 
Rees, adviser to the Special Representative, was asked to respond to these experiences and 
address the review of the Guidelines in the context of the Special Representative&#8217;s mandate 
and work. Kirsty Drew of the Trade Union Advisory Committee closed the panel 
presentations by providing a trade union perspective. The panel presentations were 
followed by a lively debate during which representatives from Government (NCPs), 
business, labour unions, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) from the North and 
the South contributed comments. 
</p>
<p>10. The focus of most of the plenary discussion was the current poor functioning of the 
OECD Guidelines and the vast majority of NCPs. The general consensus was that the 
Guidelines in their current form and as they currently function cannot contribute much to 
the operationalization of the Ruggie framework as they are largely ineffective in their role 
as a remedy mechanism. It was mentioned that of the more than 200 complaints filed by 
NGOs and unions, only a handful had been successfully resolved through the NCP-specific 
instance process. The reasons for the ineffectiveness and poor functioning of the OECD 
Guidelines were identified as follows: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Guidelines are weak on supply chain responsibility. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/29/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.10-12942 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The lack of consequences attached to violations of the OECD Guidelines or a 
company&#8217;s refusal to take part in the specific instance procedure and NCPs&#8217; general 
lack of &#8220;teeth&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The NCPs are often not independent. For instance, they are housed at economic 
affairs ministries, which are also charged with promoting business interests, leading 
to a potential conflict of interest at NCPs. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The NCPs differ greatly in their functioning. For instance, there are significant 
differences in the way NCPs deal with &#8220;parallel legal proceedings&#8221; in their decision 
as to whether to handle a complaint. There is thus a lack of &#8220;functional 
equivalence&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; NCP experience an inherent tension between transparency and confidentiality. The 
Guidelines need to be clarified with regard to transparency obligations of NCPs. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Guidelines can only be used in OECD and adhering countries or in cases of 
violations committed by companies based in OECD and adhering countries. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The reference to human rights in the Guidelines is very general. This may be 
regarded as a strength (i.e. wide coverage) or a weakness (i.e. vague). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Companies do not perceive NCPs as an authority and often do not engage seriously 
in the complaint procedure. 
</p>
<p>11. It was mentioned that some or all of these issues could be addressed in the upcoming 
review of the OECD Guidelines in 2010. Possible improvements to the Guidelines that 
were mentioned at the events included: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; NCPs should work more proactively and should be allowed to attach consequences 
to non-compliance with the Guidelines or refusal to engage in NCP-facilitated 
mediation. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The &#8220;mediating&#8221; role of NCPs should be improved. NCPs should have access to 
external mediators if they lack these skills in-house. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Guidelines should be better aligned with the needs of complainants/victims in 
the South. Representatives of Southern groups should be included and actively 
consulted in the Guidelines review process. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Guidelines should provide more clarity on the responsibility of governments. At 
this point it is very unclear how the Guidelines should be used in the case of State 
(co-)ownership of a company against which a complaint is filed. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The fact that the Guidelines are not binding should not imply they are without 
consequences. Governments should provide companies with incentives to comply 
with the Guidelines (e.g. attach conditions to export credit guarantees, participation 
in trade missions, etc.). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Special Representative&#8217;s team should be involved in the review of the 
Guidelines. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Revised Guidelines should explicitly mention &#8220;living wages&#8221; and &#8220;contract work&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; NCPs should be regularly evaluated through a peer-review system, in which 
stakeholders should also be involved. </p>

<p><b> IV. Global Justice: European transnational corporations versus 
human rights 
</b></p>
<p>12. No summary was provided by the organizers of this event. 
</p>
<p><b> V. <i>American Outrage</i> 
</b>13. This side event was organized by Julie Cavanaugh-Bill from the Western Shoshone 
Defense Project in the United States of America and involved showing a documentary film. 
The film depicts the story of the Western Shoshone struggle with human rights and the 
impacts of large-scale mining operations. The story is based on the lives of Mary and Carrie 
Dann, Western Shoshone sisters who have taken their struggle for indigenous rights in the 
United States to the United States Supreme Court and beyond. The film includes award-
winning footage of events leading to the 2006 Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination Urgent Action Decision, interviews with Committee members, the 2006 
Permanent Forum on Indigenous Populations and reflections on the impact of transnational 
corporations on the ongoing human rights violations. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Follow the money: how companies are impacting human 
rights 
</b></p>
<p>14. The event was organized jointly by the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre 
and Global Witness. It focused on how the flow of money (or rather non-flow of money in 
the tax-related cases) can undermine human rights in host States (i.e. where a foreign 
company carries out operations) through: corruption and lack of transparency; payments to 
rebels; inequitable concession contracts; tax avoidance/evasion; and transfer pricing. These 
issues were identified by the co-hosts as deserving greater attention by governments, 
companies and civil society when it comes to policy and law-making. It was felt that these 
topics have been at best peripheral to the human rights and business&#8217; debate thus far. 
</p>
<p>15. Avond W. Stells (independent researcher on South-East Asia) presented a case study 
on the effects of mass corruption on the human rights (for example, rights to life, liberty 
and security of person) of villagers who rely on resin trees for their livelihoods. The 
presentation focused on the continued issuing of permits for &#8220;plantation developments&#8221; &#8212; 
which in effect resulted in the logging of trees used for resin tapping by locals both in and 
around the plantation area &#8212; despite the Government&#8217;s suspension of logging concessions 
which was implemented in January 2002. It was stated that, in practice, the &#8220;plantation 
developments&#8221; provided a disguise for log-clearing operations in the area, and that this has 
resulted in the eradication of the forest and resin trees used by resident villagers for their 
survival. National law forbids the clearing of resin trees; however, when affected villagers 
have tried to claim their legal rights in relation to these trees, they have been physically 
threatened by people affiliated with the companies involved, who are often protected by the 
Government. 
</p>
<p>16. The second speaker, Seema Joshi (Legal Advisor, Ending Impunity, Global 
Witness), discussed payments made to rebels in the mineral supply chain in eastern 
Democratic Republic of the Congo. The presentation raised questions under Pillars 1, 2 and 
3 of the &#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; Framework. Key issues discussed included: what 
constitutes appropriate due diligence in conflict-affected areas and enforceability of 
sanctions imposed under Chapter VII, of the United Nations Charter, United Nations travel 
bans and asset freezes by States against violating companies. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/29/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> GE.10-12942 
</p>
<p>17. Christopher Avery (Director, Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre), 
introduced the issue of tax avoidance, its complexity and growing relevance to the business 
and human rights discourse/debate. The mandate of the Business &amp; Human Rights Centre is 
to draw attention to a broad range of issues and perspectives relevant to how business is 
impacting human rights, both positively and negatively. He discussed the recent launch of a 
new section on the organization&#8217;s website, on &#8220;Tax avoidance&#8221;, which includes a concise 
introduction to the issue, guidance materials, and links to reports about alleged abuses by 
companies and positive initiatives. Greater exposure of these issues was stated to be 
required because aggressive tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion by companies has a clear 
impact on human rights: if a government is starved of tax revenues, it cannot deliver to its 
people on development, health, education, housing, access to water and other human rights. 
</p>
<p>18. Next, Mauricio Lazala (Head of Latin America and the Middle East, Business &amp; 
Human Rights Resource Centre), discussed the question of tax avoidance in Latin America 
and provided insights into the case in which the company admitted to making payments to a 
paramilitary organization known to commit serious human rights violations. In July 2007, a 
group of civilian nationals filed a lawsuit against the company under the Alien Tort Claims 
Act in the United States federal court claiming that these payments made the company 
complicit in atrocities. With respect to tax avoidance, it was put forward that companies 
may use questionable accounting methods and fiscal tax havens to avoid paying a fair share 
of taxes. He stated that although tax havens have existed for decades, the flight of capital 
took off with the removal of exchange controls and the development of information 
technology in the late 1990s and is still gathering pace. 
</p>
<p>19. The last speaker Edmond Kangamungazi (Economic Justice Programme Officer, 
Caritas Zambia) discussed the issue of tax avoidance within a particular national context. 
He pointed out that around 7 million people (64 per cent) in the country live in poverty, 
with 51 per cent of those unable to access enough food to eat. He suggested that with good 
governance and transparency the exploitation of the mineral resources could generate large 
revenues that could encourage and assist in sustaining growth, health care and poverty 
reduction. Instead, over the past 40 years the country has allegedly been robbed of millions 
of dollars through tax avoidance. This is a result of a lack of transparency and governance 
in the extractive industries and also inadequate democratic scrutiny. 
</p>
<p>20. The points in the following paragraphs were discussed at the meeting. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Legal v. illegal tax avoidance 
</b></p>
<p>21. It was suggested by some participants that the problem is that, in many countries, 
there is insufficient data (numbers and figures) available to properly assess the relationship 
between tax avoidance and the inability of the Government to address human rights and 
development. Incorrect assumptions may therefore be made. Others disagreed and 
commented that they believe the relationship is clear and direct. A number of people 
commented on the need for financial transparency, accountability and accurate data. 
</p>
<p>22. It was proposed that in order to establish a clearer line between legal and illegal 
practice, law reform is needed, and current legal loopholes between international, national 
and local jurisdictions need to be addressed, which requires coordination within the 
international community. It was suggested that the lack of coordination and regulation has 
also resulted in blatant malpractice and a scenario where a company owns a network of 
subsidiaries which are all answerable to different jurisdictional and financial requirements, 
depending on where they are operating. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/29/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-12942 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Lawful companies becoming targets: legal v. illegal tax avoidance 
</b></p>
<p>23. One participant expressed a concern that companies might be targeted for lawful tax 
avoidance. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the wrong battle?&#8221; It was suggested that such practices are not 
necessarily immoral, but are carried out in order to minimize costs on behalf of 
shareholders or to increase a company&#8217;s share of the market in accordance with the host 
State&#8217;s laws. It was proposed that there should be increased pressure on host Governments 
by the international community. Therefore, the question should be: how can we help and 
encourage States to ensure that tax avoidance is not aggressive, illegal or unfair? Others, 
including a panel member, agreed on the need for pressure on governments to deter tax 
avoidance through improved laws and enforcement, but argued that in the meantime it was 
not acceptable for companies to undermine internationally-recognized human rights by 
arguing that they are acting legally under national tax laws. It was suggested that we must 
strive to attain a situation where it is simpler for a company to pay taxes according to the 
law than to employ lawyers and accounting firms to find a legal loophole. The same 
participant also felt that before making them liable, companies have to be made aware of 
the impact they are having on human rights issues &#8211; i.e. they should be given time to 
change their behaviour and that change would only happen through knowledge. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Tax avoidance and national Governments 
</b></p>
<p>24. It was suggested that infrastructure or concession agreements reached between host 
Governments and foreign companies that include provisions granting tax holidays or 
allowing for tax avoidance have the effect of distorting economic competition by local 
companies which often do not benefit from these same types of provisions. It was asked if it 
would be necessary to exclude the extractive industry or have more regulations for that 
industry because of its blatant refusal to pay taxes or generous tax holidays being granted in 
some countries. A panel member spoke about the example of the timber industry in Liberia 
where substantial sums of Government revenue were embezzled and transferred to offshore 
accounts. It was suggested that the closing of such accounts or even the closing of 
loopholes in Liberian laws would not suffice to implement due diligence and good 
transparency. It was suggested that it was the Liberian authorities who allowed foreign 
companies to operate in such a way &#8211; that it was due to the complicity of the Government 
of Liberia that corruption, tax avoidance and personal enrichment were in fact possible. In 
consequence, it was put forward that pressure should be put not only on companies, but also 
on the host Government to ensure the implementation of due diligence- and transparency-
related measures. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Payments made to illegal armed groups &#8211; legal accountability 
</b></p>
<p>25. It was mentioned that Global Witness&#8217; recent report entitled &#8220;Faced with a gun, what 
can you do?&#8221; looks at the supply of minerals from the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
and stresses that action by home States (i.e. where companies are domiciled) is urgently 
required at both the national and international level to stop international mineral companies 
from trading with companies that are making payments to illegal armed groups. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. National human rights institutions&#8217; role in business and 
human rights 
</b></p>
<p>26. This side event, organized by the International Coordinating Committee of National 
Human Rights Institutions (ICC) in collaboration with OHCHR, aimed at discussing the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/29/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> GE.10-12942 
</p>
<p>roles, experiences and potential activities of national human rights institutions (NHRIs) in 
relation to human rights and business. Approximately 30 representatives from NHRIs, 
NGOs and Member States met at a side event in Geneva during the OHCHR consultations 
on operationalizing the three-pillar framework presented by the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other 
business enterprises. 
</p>
<p>27. Jennifer Lynch, chair of the ICC and Chief Commissioner of the Canadian National 
Human Rights Commission, thanked the speakers and the participants for their attendance 
at the event. She mentioned the creation of a Working Group within the ICC on Human 
Rights and business, which is composed of NHRI representatives from each region and 
highlighted the work of this thematic group. 
</p>
<p>28. Jonas Christoffersen, Director, Danish Institute for Human Rights, mentioned the 
importance of the side event for gathering ideas and feedback for the work of the Working 
Group and highlighted the increasing importance of human rights and business on the 
agenda of NHRIs. 
</p>
<p>29. Omar Cabezas Lacayo, Procurador para la Defensa de los Derechos Humanos of 
Nicaragua explained how the increasing number of corporate actors has had an impact on 
human rights. He gave an overview of this situation, referring specifically to the Latin 
American problems. 
</p>
<p>30. Myriam Montrat, member of the Canadian Human Rights Commission, described 
the &#8220;Maturity Model&#8221; that has been developed by the Canadian Human Rights Commission 
to help prevent cases of business-related grievances. 
</p>
<p>31. Jody Kollapen, Former Chair of the South African Human Rights Commission, 
focused his intervention on activities NHRIs may undertake and use their mandates under 
the Paris Principles to address grievances resulting from business activities. 
</p>
<p>32. Claire Charters from the Aotearoa Indigenous Rights Trust and University of 
Wellington, New Zealand, explained how indigenous peoples may be affected by the 
human rights violations of corporate actors. She stressed the essential role that NHRIs can 
play by enforcing their rights and providing pragmatic guidance to the State and to the 
indigenous communities on this issue. 
</p>
<p>33. Allan Miller, Chair of the Scottish Human Rights Commission, referred to the role 
of NHRIs dealing with human rights and business. He highlighted the need to promote 
respect for human rights in the corporate sector &#8212; the second pillar of the Special 
Representative&#8217;s framework &#8212; for instance through human rights education and raising 
public awareness.
