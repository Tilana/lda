Corporate Governance Statement | 30 June 2016 
 
 
The ASX Listing Rules require listed companies to include in their Annual Report a statement disclosing 
the extent to which they have complied with the ASX Best Practice Recommendations in the reporting 
period. These recommendations are guidelines designed to produce an efficiency, quality or integrity 
outcome.  The recommendations are not prescriptive so that if a company considers that a 
recommendation is inappropriate having regard to its own circumstances, the company has the 
flexibility not to follow it.  Where a company has not followed all the recommendations, the annual 
report must identify which recommendations have not been followed and give reasons for not 
following them. 
A table has been included at the end of this statement which sets out the ASX Best Practice 
Recommendations and states whether the Company has complied with each recommendation in 
the reporting period.  Where the Company considered it was not appropriate to comply with a 
particular recommendation the reasons are set out in the notes referenced in the table.  A full copy of 
the Company’s Principles of Corporate Governance Standard is available on the Company’s website 
at www.metromining.com.au

is responsible for the on-going review of business risks that could affect the Company. The board has 
established an Audit, Risk and Remuneration Committee which operates under the Audit and Risk 
Committee Charter (available on the Company’s website www.metromining.com.au.). The Audit, Risk

Corporate Governance Statement | 30 June 2016 
 

The Company’s risk management and internal compliance and control system is operating 
effectively in all material respects.
Security Trading Policy 
The Company’s policy regarding directors and employees trading in its securities is set out in the 
Company’s Share Trading Policy, available on the Company’s website. The policy restricts directors 
and employees from acting on material information until it has been released to the market and 
adequate time has been given for this to be reflected in the security’s prices, and in addition requires 
any director, the Chief Executive Officer or Company Secretary not to trade during prohibited periods 
unless the chairperson or a designated director is notified, and gives a clearance to deal.  Prohibited 
periods are such periods as the directors determine.  The chairperson must not deal in any securities of 
the Company during a prohibited period without first notifying the chief executive officer or the 
chairman of the audit committee and receiving clearance to deal from them or, if the chief executive 
officer or the Chairman of the audit committee is not readily available, without first notifying a senior 
independent director, or a committee of the board or other officer of the Company nominated for 
that purpose by the chief executive officer, and receiving clearance to deal from that director, 
committee or officer. 
A restricted person, who is not in possession of Inside Information in relation to the Company, may be 
given clearance to deal during a prohibited period if they are in severe financial difficulty or there are 
other exceptional circumstances. Clearance may be given for such a person to sell (but not 
purchase) securities of the Company when they would otherwise be prohibited by this policy from 
doing so. The determination of whether the person in question is in severe financial difficulty or 
whether there are other exceptional circumstances can only be made by the clearance officer 
designated by the board for this purpose. 
A person may be in severe financial difficulty if they have a pressing financial commitment that 
cannot be satisfied otherwise than by selling the relevant securities of the Company. A liability of such 
a person to pay tax would not normally constitute severe financial difficulty unless the person has no 
other means of satisfying the liability. A circumstance will be considered exceptional if the person in 
question is required by a court order to transfer or sell the securities of the Company or there is some 
other overriding legal requirement to do so. 
A restricted person may enter into a margin loan or similar funding arrangement in respect of any 
Company shares (funding arrangements) but must disclose the existence of the funding arrangements 
to a clearance officer who shall notify the board. 
The law prohibits insider trading and the Corporations Act 2001 and the ASX Listing Rules require 
disclosure of any trading undertaken by directors or their related entities in the Company’s securities.
