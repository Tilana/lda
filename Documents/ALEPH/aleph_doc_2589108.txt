On March 8, 2016, the company announced that it had entered into agreements which will
result in the sale and transition of its remaining company-owned Esso retail stations to a
branded wholesaler operating model for approximately $2.8 billion. Under the branded
wholesaler model, Imperial supplies fuel to independent third parties who own and/or
operate the sites in alignment with Esso brand standards. The company’s gain on sale,
which is subject to final closing adjustments, is anticipated to be in the range of $2.0 billion
to $2.1 billion ($1.7 billion to $1.8 billion after tax). Subsequent to the quarter, in July the
company completed the sale of its sites in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Nova Scotia and
Newfoundland for approximately $85 million, having an approximate net book value of $23
million. The remaining transactions are anticipated to close by year-end 2016, subject to
regulatory approvals.
The major classes of assets classified as held for sale within the Downstream segment at

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new standard,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The standard establishes a single revenue
recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry specific
requirements and expands disclosure requirements. The standard will be adopted
beginning January 1, 2018. Imperial is evaluating the standard and its effect on the
company’s financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued a new standard, Leases. The standard requires all
leases with an initial term greater than one year be recorded on the balance sheet as an
asset and lease liability. The standard is required to be adopted beginning January 1,
2019. Imperial is evaluating the standard and its effect on the company’s financial
statements.

Item 2.
Management’s discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations
Operating results
Second quarter 2016 vs. second quarter 2015
The company’s net loss for the second quarter of 2016 was $181 million or $0.21 per share
on a diluted basis, compared to net income of $120 million or $0.14 per share for the same
period last year. Wildfires in northern Alberta significantly impacted results in the quarter,
reducing net income by about $170 million.
Upstream recorded a net loss in the second quarter of $290 million, compared to a net loss
of $174 million in the same period of 2015. Results in the second quarter of 2016 reflected
lower realizations of about $500 million, the impact of the northern Alberta wildfires on
Syncrude and Kearl operations of about $155 million and higher depreciation expense of
about $50 million. These factors were partially offset by higher Kearl and Cold Lake
volumes of about $105 million, the impact of a weaker Canadian dollar of about $65 million
and the favourable impact of lower royalties of about $50 million. Earnings in the second
quarter of 2015 reflected the impact associated with increased Alberta corporate income
taxes of about $327 million.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) averaged US$45.64 per barrel in the second quarter of
2016, down from US$57.90 per barrel in the same quarter of 2015. Western Canada Select
(WCS) averaged US$32.36 per barrel and US$46.41 per barrel respectively for the same
periods. The WTI / WCS differential widened to 29 percent in the second quarter of 2016,
from 20 percent in the same period of 2015.
During the second quarter of 2016, the Canadian dollar weakened relative to the U.S. dollar
versus the same period of 2015. The Canadian dollar averaged US$0.78 in the second
quarter of 2016, a decrease of US$0.03 from the second quarter of 2015.
Imperial’s average Canadian dollar realizations for bitumen and synthetic crudes declined
essentially in line with the North American benchmarks, adjusted for changes in the
exchange rate and transportation costs. Bitumen realizations averaged $29.45 per barrel
for the second quarter of 2016, a decrease of $19.71 per barrel versus the second quarter
of 2015. Synthetic crude realizations averaged $58.58 per barrel, a decrease of $16.62 per
barrel for the same period of 2015.
Gross production of Cold Lake bitumen averaged 163,000 barrels per day in the second
quarter, up from 161,000 barrels in the same period last year. Incremental volumes from
Nabiye offset cycle timing in the base operation.
Gross production of Kearl bitumen averaged 155,000 barrels per day in the second quarter
(110,000 barrels Imperial’s share) up from 130,000 barrels per day (92,000 barrels Imperial’s
share) during the second quarter of 2015. Kearl production was reduced in the current
quarter by 64,000 barrels per day (45,000 Imperial’s share) due to the Alberta wildfires and
planned maintenance activities.
The company’s share of gross production from Syncrude averaged 18,000 barrels per
day, compared to 52,000 barrels in the second quarter of 2015. Syncrude production was
reduced in the current quarter by 54,000 barrels per day due to the Alberta wildfires and
planned maintenance activities.
Downstream net income was $71 million in the second quarter, compared to $215 million
in the same period of 2015. Earnings decreased mainly due to the impact of higher refinery
turnarounds of about $115 million and lower industry margins of about $45 million.
Refinery throughput averaged 246,000 barrels per day, compared to 373,000 barrels in the
second quarter of 2015. The decrease was mainly associated with planned turnaround
activity at the Strathcona and Nanticoke refineries. Excluding the impact of the planned
turnarounds, capacity utilization averaged 97 percent.
Petroleum product sales were 470,000 barrels per day, compared to 478,000 barrels per
day in the second quarter of 2015.

Chemical net income was $55 million in the second quarter, compared to $69 million in the
same quarter of 2015.
Net income effects from Corporate and Other were negative $17 million in the second
quarter, compared to positive $10 million in the same period of 2015.
Six months 2016 vs. six months 2015
Net loss in the first six months of 2016 was $282 million, or $0.33 per share on a diluted
basis, versus net income of $541 million or $0.64 per share for the first six months of 2015.
Upstream recorded a net loss of $738 million for the first six months of 2016, compared to
a net loss of $363 million for the same period last year. The loss in 2016 reflected lower
realizations of about $870 million, the impact of the northern Alberta wildfires on Syncrude
and Kearl operations of about $155 million and higher depreciation expense of about
$105 million. These factors were partially offset by the impact of a weaker Canadian dollar
of about $135 million, higher Kearl and Cold Lake volumes of about $130 million, the
favourable impact of lower royalties of about $80 million and lower energy cost of about
$60 million. Earnings in the second quarter of 2015 reflected the impact associated with
increased Alberta corporate income taxes of about $327 million.
West Texas Intermediate averaged US$39.78 per barrel in the first six months of 2016
down from US$53.35 per barrel in the same period last year. Western Canada Select
averaged US$25.88 per barrel and US$40.14 per barrel respectively for the same periods.
The WTI / WCS differential widened to 35 percent in the first six months of 2016, from 25
percent in the same period of 2015.
During the first six months of 2016, the Canadian dollar weakened relative to the U.S.
dollar versus the same period of 2015. The Canadian dollar averaged US$0.75 in the first
six months of 2016, a decrease of US$0.06 from the same period of 2015.
Imperial’s average Canadian dollar realizations for bitumen and synthetic crudes declined
essentially in line with the North American benchmarks, adjusted for changes in the
exchange rate and transportation costs. Bitumen realizations averaged $20.76 per barrel
for the first six months of 2016, a decrease of $18.39 per barrel versus the same period of
2015. Synthetic crude realizations averaged $48.59 per barrel, a decrease of $15.30 per
barrel for the same period of 2015.
Gross production of Cold Lake bitumen averaged 164,000 barrels per day in the first six
months, up from 156,000 barrels from the same period last year, primarily due to Nabiye
production.
Gross production of Kearl bitumen averaged 175,000 barrels per day in the first six
months of 2016 (124,000 barrels Imperial’s share) up from 113,000 barrels per day (80,000
barrels Imperial’s share). The increase was the result of the start-up of the expansion
project and improved reliability of the initial development. Kearl production was reduced
by 32,000 barrels per day (23,000 Imperial’s share) due to the Alberta wildfires and planned
maintenance activities.
During the first six months of 2016, the company’s share of gross production from
Syncrude averaged 49,000 barrels per day, compared to 63,000 barrels from the same
period of 2015. Syncrude production was reduced by 13,000 barrels per day due to the
Alberta wildfires and planned maintenance activities.
Downstream net income was $391 million, compared to $780 million from the same period
of 2015. Earnings decreased due to the impact of lower downstream margins of about
$480 million and higher refinery turnarounds of about $115 million. These factors were
partially offset by the impact of a weaker Canadian dollar of about $130 million and lower
fuels marketing operating costs of about $50 million.
Refinery throughput averaged 323,000 barrels per day in the first six months of 2016,
compared to 383,000 barrels in the same period of 2015. Capacity utilization decreased to
77 percent from 91 percent in the same period of 2015. The lower utilization reflected
higher turnaround activity in 2016.

materially from that discussed on page 22 of the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015 and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016
except for the following:
Earnings Sensitivities
millions of Canadian dollars after tax
Seven cents decrease (increase) in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the
U.S. dollar
+ (-)
590
The sensitivity of net income to changes in the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar
increased from the first quarter of 2016 by about $20 million (after tax) a year for each one-
cent change, primarily due to the increase in bitumen prices and improved crack spreads.
Item 4.  Controls and procedures
As indicated in the certifications in Exhibit 31 of this report, the company’s principal
executive officer and principal financial officer have evaluated the company’s disclosure
controls and procedures as of June 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation, these officers
have concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated
and communicated to them in a manner that allows for timely decisions regarding required
disclosures and are effective in ensuring that such information is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s rules and forms.
There has not been any change in the company’s internal control over financial reporting
during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, the company’s internal control over financial reporting.
