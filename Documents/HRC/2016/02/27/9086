<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 7/23 in 
which the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) was 
requested to conduct a detailed analytical study of the relationship between climate change and 
human rights, taking into account the views of States and other stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>2. Written submissions were received from States, intergovernmental organizations, national 
human rights institutions, non-governmental organizations, and individual experts. OHCHR also 
organized a one-day open-ended consultation on the relationship between climate change and 
human rights, held on 22 October 2008 in Geneva. The inputs received during the consultation 
process have informed the preparation of this report.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>3. This report seeks to outline main aspects of the relationship between climate change and 
human rights. Climate change debates have traditionally focused on scientific, environmental 
and economic aspects. As scientific understanding of the causes and consequences of climate 
change has evolved and impacts on human lives and living conditions have become more 
evident, the focus of debates has progressively broadened with increasing attention being given 
to human and social dimensions of climate change. Human Rights Council resolution 7/23 on 
human rights and climate change exemplifies this broadening of the debate. 
</p>
<p>4. Special procedures of the Human Rights Council have also addressed the human rights 
implications of climate change in recent statements and reports,<b>2 </b>while the Organization of 
American States and the Alliance of Small Island States have recently drawn attention to the 
relationship between climate change and human rights.<b>3</b> In addition,<b> </b>a growing volume of reports 
and studies address the interface between climate change and human rights.<b>4</b>

</p>
<p><b>I.  CLIMATE CHANGE:  AN OVERVIEW 
</b></p>
<p><b>Global warming and its causes 
</b></p>
<p>5. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which has near universal 
membership, provides the common international framework to address the causes and 
consequences of climate change, also referred to as &#8220;global warming&#8221;. The Convention defines 
climate change as &#8220;a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human 
activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural 
climate variability observed over comparable time periods&#8221;.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>6. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has greatly contributed to 
improving understanding about and raising awareness of climate change risks.<b>6</b> Since the 
publication of its First Assessment Report (IPCC AR1) in 1990, climate science has rapidly 
evolved, enabling the IPCC to make increasingly definitive statements about the reality, causes 
and consequences of climate change. Its Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC AR4), issued in 2007, 
presents a clear scientific consensus that global warming &#8220;is unequivocal&#8221; and that, with more 
than 90 per cent certainty, most of the warming observed over the past 50 years is caused by 
manmade greenhouse gas emissions.<b>7</b> Current levels of greenhouse gas concentrations far exceed 
pre-industrial levels as recorded in polar ice cores dating back 650,000 years, and the 
predominant source of this increase is the combustion of fossil fuels.<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>7. The IPCC AR4 presents the current scientific consensus on climate change. It is based on 
the contributions of three working groups focusing on: the physical science basis (Working 
Group I); impacts, adaptation and vulnerability (Working Group II); and mitigation of climate 
change (Working Group III). The Synthesis Report and Summaries for Policymakers have been 
adopted and approved by member States at an IPCC plenary session. The findings provide the 
main scientific resource for this study in exploring the relationship between climate change and 
human rights.

<p><b>5
</b>  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), art. 1, para. 2. The 
</p>
<p>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) uses a similar definition, the main 
difference being that IPCC covers all aspects of climate change and does not make a distinction 
between climate change attributable to human activity and climate change and variability 
attributable to natural causes. 
<b>6
</b>  IPCC was set up jointly by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in 1988 to provide authoritative assessments, 
based on the best available scientific literature, on climate change causes, impacts and possible 
response strategies.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Observed and projected impacts 
</b>8. Amongst the main observed and projected changes in weather patterns related to global 
warming are:<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Contraction of snow-covered areas and shrinking of sea ice 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Sea level rise and higher water temperatures 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Increased frequency of hot extremes and heatwaves 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Heavy precipitation events and increase in areas affected by drought 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Increased intensity of tropical cyclones (typhoons and hurricanes) 
</p>
<p>9. The IPCC assessments and a growing volume of studies provide an increasingly 
detailed picture of how these changes in the physical climate will impact on human lives. 
IPCC AR4 outlines impacts in six main areas: ecosystems; food; water; health; coasts; and 
industry, settlement and society,<b>10</b> some of which are described further below in relation to 
their implications for specific human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>Unequal burden and the equity principle 
</b></p>
<p>10. Industrialized countries, defined as annex I countries under the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change, have historically contributed most to manmade greenhouse gas 
emissions. At the same time, the impacts of climate change are distributed very unevenly, 
disproportionally affecting poorer regions and countries, that is, those who have generally 
contributed the least to human-induced climate change.  
</p>
<p>11. The unequal burden of the effects of climate change is reflected in article 3 of the 
Convention (referred to as &#8220;the equity article&#8221;). It stipulates that parties should protect the 
climate system &#8220;on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated 
responsibilities and respective capabilities&#8221;; that developed countries &#8220;should take the lead in 
combating climate change and the adverse effects thereof&#8221; and that full consideration should be 
given to the needs of developing countries, especially &#8220;those that are particularly vulnerable to 
the adverse effects of climate change&#8221; and &#8220;that would have to bear a disproportionate or 
abnormal burden under the Convention&#8221;.<b>11</b> Giving operational meaning to the &#8220;equity principle&#8221; 
is a key challenge in ongoing climate change negotiations. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>9
</b>  With the exception of impacts on tropical cyclones, the IPCC AR4 considers these impacts 
</p>
<p><i>very likely</i> (more than 90 per cent certainty). Projections on increased intensity of tropical 
cyclones are considered <i>likely</i> (more than 66 per cent certainty). 
<b>10
</b></p>
<p>  See IPCC AR4 Synthesis Report, pp. 48-53. 
<b>11
</b></p>
<p>  UNFCCC, art. 3, paras. 1 and 2. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Response measures:  mitigation and adaptation 
</b></p>
<p>12. Mitigation and adaptation are the two main strategies to address climate change. Mitigation 
aims to minimize the extent of global warming by reducing emission levels and stabilizing 
greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. Adaptation aims to strengthen the capacity of 
societies and ecosystems to cope with and adapt to climate change risks and impacts. 
</p>
<p>13. Reaching an agreement on required global mitigation measures lies at the heart of 
international climate change negotiations. Article 2 defines the &#8220;ultimate objective&#8221; of the 
Convention and associated instruments as &#8220;the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in 
the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the 
climate system&#8221;. A key question is to operationally define the term &#8220;dangerous&#8221;.<b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>14. Over the past decades, scientific studies and policy considerations have converged towards 
a threshold for dangerous climate change of a maximum rise in global average temperature 
of 2&#186; C above the pre-industrial level.<b>13</b> Staying below this threshold will significantly reduce the 
adverse impacts on ecosystems and human lives. It will require that global greenhouse gas 
emissions peak within the next decade and be reduced to less than 50 per cent of the current level 
by 2050. Yet, even this stabilization scenario would lead to a &#8220;best estimate&#8221; global average 
temperature increase of 2&#176; C - 2.4&#176; C above pre-industrial levels.<b>14</b> Moreover, the possibility of 
containing the temperature rise to around 2&#176;C becomes increasingly unlikely if emission 
reductions are postponed beyond the next 15 years. 
</p>
<p>15. Adaptation and the financing of adaptation measures are also central in international 
climate change negotiations. Irrespective of the scale of mitigation measures taken today and 
over the next decades, global warming will continue due to the inertia of the climate system and 
the long-term effects of previous greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, adaptation measures 
are required to enable societies to cope with the effects of now unavoidable global warming. 
Climate change adaptation covers a wide range of actions and strategies, such as building sea 
defences, relocating populations from flood-prone areas, improved water management, and early 
warning systems. Equally, adaptation requires strengthening the capacities and coping 
mechanisms of individuals and communities.

<p><b>12
</b>  While UNFCCC does not include specific greenhouse gas reduction targets, its Kyoto 
</p>
<p>Protocol assigns legally binding caps on greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries 
and emerging economies for the period 2008-2012. The Protocol entered into force in 2005 and 
has to date been ratified by 183 parties to UNFCCC.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>II.  IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ENJOYMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Climate change, environmental harm and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>16. An increase in global average temperatures of approximately 2&#176; C will have major, and 
predominantly negative, effects on ecosystems across the globe, on the goods and services they 
provide. Already today, climate change is among the most important drivers of ecosystem 
changes, along with overexploitation of resources and pollution.<b>15 </b>Moreover, global warming 
will exacerbate the harmful effects of environmental pollution, including higher levels of 
ground-level ozone in urban areas. In view of such effects, which have implications for a wide 
range of human rights, it is relevant to discuss the relationship between human rights and the 
environment. 
</p>
<p>17. Principle 1 of the 1972 Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human 
Environment (the Stockholm Declaration) states that there is &#8220;a fundamental right to freedom, 
equality and adequate conditions of life, in an environment of a quality that permits a life of 
dignity and well-being&#8221;.<b> </b>The Stockholm Declaration reflects a general recognition of the 
interdependence and interrelatedness of human rights and the environment.<b>16 
</b></p>
<p>18. While the universal human rights treaties do not refer to a specific right to a safe and 
healthy environment, the United Nations human rights treaty bodies all recognize the intrinsic 
link between the environment and the realization of a range of human rights, such as the right to 
life, to health, to food, to water, and to housing.<b>17</b> The Convention on the Rights of the Child 
provides that States parties shall take appropriate measures to combat disease and malnutrition 
&#8220;through the provision of adequate nutritious foods and clean drinking water, taking into 
consideration the dangers and risks of environmental pollution&#8221;.<b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>15
</b>  See Millennium Ecosystems Assessment 2005, <i>Ecosystems and Human Well-being</i>, 
</p>
<p>Synthesis, pp. 67 and 79. 
<b>16
</b></p>
<p>  A joint seminar on human rights and the environment organized by OHCHR and UNEP 
in 2002 also documented a growing recognition of the connection between human rights, 
environmental protection and sustainable development (see E/CN.4/2002/WP.7). 
<b>17
</b></p>
<p>  ILO Convention No. 169 (1989) concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent 
Countries provides for special protection of the environment of the areas which indigenous 
peoples occupy or otherwise use. At the regional level, the African Charter on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights and the San Salvador Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights 
recognize the right to live in a healthy or satisfactory environment. Moreover, many national 
constitutions refer to a right to an environment of a certain quality.<i> 
<b></b></i><b>18
</b></p>
<p>  Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), art. 24, para. 2 (c). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>19. Equally, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) has clarified 
that the right to adequate food requires the adoption of &#8220;appropriate economic, environmental 
and social policies&#8221; and that the right to health extends to its underlying determinants, including 
a healthy environment.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Effects on specific rights 
</b></p>
<p>20. Whereas global warming will potentially have implications for the full range of human 
rights, the following subsections provide examples of rights which seem to relate most directly to 
climate change-related impacts identified by IPCC. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  The right to life 
</b></p>
<p>21. The right to life is explicitly protected under the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.<b>20</b> The Human Rights Committee 
has described the right to life as the &#8220;supreme right&#8221;, &#8220;basic to all human rights&#8221;, and it is a right 
from which no derogation is permitted even in time of public emergency.<b>21 </b>Moreover, the 
Committee has clarified that the right to life imposes an obligation on States to take positive 
measures for its protection, including taking measures to reduce infant mortality, malnutrition 
and epidemics.<b>22</b> The Convention on the Rights of the Child explicitly links the right to life to the 
obligation of States &#8220;to ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of 
the child&#8221;.<b>23</b> According to the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the right to survival and 
development must be implemented in a holistic manner, &#8220;through the enforcement of all the 
other provisions of the Convention, including rights to health, adequate nutrition, social security, 
an adequate standard of living, a healthy and safe environment &#8230;&#8221;.<b>24</b>

<b>22
</b></p>
<p>  Human Rights Committee, general comment No. 6, para. 5. Likewise, the Committee 
has asked States to provide data on pregnancy and childbirth-related deaths and 
gender-disaggregated data on infant mortality rates when reporting on the status of 
implementation of the right to life (general comment No. 28 (2000) on art. 3 (The equality of 
rights between men and women), para. 10).

 <p> 
</p>
<p>22. A number of observed and projected effects of climate change will pose direct and indirect 
threats to human lives. IPCC AR4 projects with high confidence an increase in people suffering 
from death, disease and injury from heatwaves, floods, storms, fires and droughts. Equally, 
climate change will affect the right to life through an increase in hunger and malnutrition and 
related disorders impacting on child growth and development; cardiorespiratory morbidity and 
mortality related to ground-level ozone.<b>25 
</b></p>
<p>23. Climate change will exacerbate weather-related disasters which already have 
devastating effects on people and their enjoyment of the right to life, particularly in the 
developing world. For example, an estimated 262 million people were affected by 
climate disasters annually from 2000 to 2004, of whom over 98 per cent live in developing 
countries.<b>26</b> Tropical cyclone hazards, affecting approximately 120 million people annually, 
killed an estimated 250,000 people from 1980 to 2000.<b>27</b> 
</p>
<p>24. Protection of the right to life, generally and in the context of climate change, is closely 
related to measures for the fulfilment of other rights, such as those related to food, water, health 
and housing. With regard to weather-related natural disasters, this close interconnectedness of 
rights is reflected in the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) operational guidelines on 
human rights and natural disasters.<b>28</b> 
</p>
<p><b>2.  The right to adequate food  
</b></p>
<p>25. The right to food is explicitly mentioned under the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities and implied in general provisions on an adequate standard of 
living of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and 
the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.<b>29</b> 
In addition to a right to adequate food, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and

(CEDAW), art. 14, para. 2 (h); International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination (ICERD), art. 5 (e). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights also enshrines &#8220;the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger&#8221;.<b>30</b> 
Elements of the right to food include the availability of adequate food (including through the 
possibility of feeding oneself from natural resources) and accessible to all individuals under the 
jurisdiction of a State. Equally, States must ensure freedom from hunger and take necessary 
action to alleviate hunger, even in times of natural or other disasters.<b>31</b> 
</p>
<p>26. As a consequence of climate change, the potential for food production is projected initially 
to increase at mid to high latitudes with an increase in global average temperature in the range of 
1-3&#176; C. However, at lower latitudes crop productivity is projected to decrease, increasing the risk 
of hunger and food insecurity in the poorer regions of the word.<b>32</b> According to one estimate, an 
additional 600 million people will face malnutrition due to climate change,<b>33</b> with a particularly 
negative effect on sub-Saharan Africa.<b>34</b> Poor people living in developing countries are 
particularly vulnerable given their disproportionate dependency on climate-sensitive resources 
for their food and livelihoods.<b>35</b> 
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur on the right to food has documented how extreme climate events 
are increasingly threatening livelihoods and food security.<b>36</b> In responding to this threat, the 
realization of the right to adequate food requires that special attention be given to vulnerable and 
disadvantaged groups, including people living in disaster prone areas and indigenous peoples 
whose livelihood may be threatened.<b>37</b>

<p><b>3.  The right to water 
</b></p>
<p>28. CESCR has defined the right to water as the right of everyone to sufficient, safe, 
acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic uses, such as 
drinking, food preparation and personal and household hygiene.<b>38 </b>The Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities explicitly refer to access to water services in provisions on an adequate 
standard of living, while the Convention on the Rights of the Child refers to the provision of 
&#8220;clean drinking water&#8221; as part of the measures States shall take to combat disease and 
malnutrition.<b>39</b> 
</p>
<p>29. Loss of glaciers and reductions in snow cover are projected to increase and to negatively 
affect water availability for more than one-sixth of the world&#8217;s population supplied by meltwater 
from mountain ranges. Weather extremes, such as drought and flooding, will also impact on 
water supplies.<b>40</b> Climate change will thus exacerbate existing stresses on water resources and 
compound the problem of access to safe drinking water, currently denied to an estimated 
1.1 billion people globally and a major cause of morbidity and disease.<b>41</b> In this regard, climate 
change interacts with a range of other causes of water stress, such as population growth, 
environmental degradation, poor water management, poverty and inequality.<b>42</b> 
</p>
<p>30. As various studies document, the negative effects of climate change on water supply and 
on the effective enjoyment of the right to water can be mitigated through the adoption of 
appropriate measures and policies.<b>43

<p><b>4.  The right to health 
</b></p>
<p>31. The right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health (the right to 
health) is most comprehensively addressed in article 12 of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and referred to in five other core international human 
rights treaties.<b>44 </b>This right implies the enjoyment of, and equal access to, appropriate health care 
and, more broadly, to goods, services and conditions which enable a person to live a healthy life. 
Underlying determinants of health include adequate food and nutrition, housing, safe drinking 
water and adequate sanitation, and a healthy environment.<b>45</b> Other key elements are the 
availability, accessibility (both physically and economically), and quality of health and 
health-care facilities, goods and services.<b>46</b> 
</p>
<p>32. Climate change is projected to affect the health status of millions of people, including 
through increases in malnutrition, increased diseases and injury due to extreme weather events, 
and an increased burden of diarrhoeal, cardiorespiratory and infectious diseases.<b>47</b> Global 
warming may also affect the spread of malaria and other vector borne diseases in some parts of 
the world.<b>48</b> Overall, the negative health effects will disproportionately be felt in sub-Saharan 
Africa, South Asia and the Middle East. Poor health and malnutrition increases vulnerability and 
reduces the capacity of individuals and groups to adapt to climate change. 
</p>
<p>33. Climate change constitutes a severe additional stress to health systems worldwide, 
prompting the Special Rapporteur on the right to health to warn that a failure of the international 
community to confront the health threats posed by global warming will endanger the lives of 
millions of people.<b>49 </b>Most at risk are those individuals and communities with a low adaptive 
capacity. Conversely, addressing poor health is one central aspect of reducing vulnerability to the 
effects of climate change.

</b></p>
<p>  Uncertainty remains about the potential impact of climate change on malaria at local and 
global scales because of a lack of data and the interplay of other contributing non-climatic 
factors such as socio-economic development, immunity and drug resistance (see IPCC 
WGII Report, p. 404). 
<b>49
</b></p>
<p>  A/62/214, para. 102. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>34. Non-climate related factors, such as education, health care, public health initiatives, are 
critical in determining how global warming will affect the health of populations.<b>50</b> Protecting the 
right to health in the face of climate change will require comprehensive measures, including 
mitigating the adverse impacts of global warming on underlying determinants of health and 
giving priority to protecting vulnerable individuals and communities. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  The right to adequate housing </b></p>
<p>35. The right to adequate housing is enshrined in several core international human rights 
instruments and most comprehensively under the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights as an element of the right to an adequate standard of living.<b>51</b> The right to 
adequate housing has been defined as &#8220;the right to live somewhere in security, peace and 
dignity&#8221;.<b>52</b> Core elements of this right include security of tenure, protection against forced 
evictions,<b>53</b> availability of services, materials, facilities and infrastructure, affordability, 
habitability, accessibility, location and cultural adequacy.<b>54</b> 
</p>
<p>36. Observed and projected climate change will affect the right to adequate housing in several 
ways. Sea level rise and storm surges will have a direct impact on many coastal settlements.<b>55</b> In 
the Arctic region and in low-lying island States such impacts have already led to the relocation 
of peoples and communities.<b>56</b> Settlements in low-lying mega-deltas are also particularly at risk, 
as evidenced by the millions of people and homes affected by flooding in recent years.  
</p>
<p>37. The erosion of livelihoods, partly caused by climate change, is a main &#8220;push&#8221; factor for 
increasing rural to urban migration. Many will move to urban slums and informal settlements 
where they are often forced to build shelters in hazardous areas.<b>57 </b>Already today, an estimated 
1 billion people live in urban slums on fragile hillsides or flood-prone riverbanks and face acute 
vulnerability to extreme climate events.<b>58</b>

<p>38. Human rights guarantees in the context of climate change include: (a) adequate protection 
of housing from weather hazards (habitability of housing); (b) access to housing away from 
hazardous zones; (c) access to shelter and disaster preparedness in cases of displacement caused 
by extreme weather events; (d) protection of communities that are relocated away from 
hazardous zones, including protection against forced evictions without appropriate forms of legal 
or other protection, including adequate consultation with affected persons.<b>59</b> 
</p>
<p><b>6.  The right to self-determination 
</b></p>
<p>39. The right to self-determination is a fundamental principle of international law. Common 
article 1, paragraph 1, of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights establishes that &#8220;all peoples have the 
right of self-determination&#8221;, by virtue of which &#8220;they freely determine their political status and 
freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development&#8221;.<b>60</b> Important aspects of the right 
to self-determination include the right of a people not to be deprived of its own means of 
subsistence and the obligation of a State party to promote the realization of the right to 
self-determination, including for people living outside its territory.<b>61 </b>While the right to 
self-determination is a collective right held by peoples rather than individuals, its realization is 
an essential condition for the effective enjoyment of individual human rights. 
40. Sea level rise and extreme weather events related to climate change are threatening the 
habitability and, in the longer term, the territorial existence of a number of low-lying island 
States. Equally, changes in the climate threaten to deprive indigenous peoples of their traditional 
territories and sources of livelihood. Either of these impacts would have implications for the 
right to self-determination. 
</p>
<p>41. The inundation and disappearance of small island States would have implications for the 
right to self-determination, as well as for the full range of human rights for which individuals 
depend on the State for their protection. The disappearance of a State for climate change-related 
reasons would give rise to a range of legal questions, including concerning the status of people 
inhabiting such disappearing territories and the protection afforded to them under international 
law (discussed further below). While there is no clear precedence to follow, it is clear that 
insofar as climate change poses a threat to the right of peoples to self-determination, States have 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>59
</b>  In this regard the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement (E/CN.4/1998/53/Add.2, 
</p>
<p>annex) provide that &#8220;at the minimum, regardless of the circumstances, and without 
discrimination, competent authorities shall provide internally displaced persons with and ensure 
safe access to: &#8230; basic shelter and housing&#8221; (principle 18). 
<b>60
</b></p>
<p>  The right to self-determination is enshrined in Articles 1 and 55 of the Charter of the 
United Nations and also contained in the Declaration on the Right to Development, art. 1, 
para. 2, and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, arts. 3 and 4.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>a duty to take positive action, individually and jointly, to address and avert this threat. Equally, 
States have an obligation to take action to avert climate change impacts which threaten the 
cultural and social identity of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Effects on specific groups 
</b></p>
<p>42. The effects of climate change will be felt most acutely by those segments of the population 
who are already in vulnerable situations due to factors such as poverty, gender, age, minority 
status, and disability.<b>62 </b>Under international human rights law, States are legally bound to address 
such vulnerabilities in accordance with the principle of equality and non-discrimination. 
</p>
<p>43. Vulnerability and impact assessments in the context of climate change largely focus on 
impacts on economic sectors, such as health and water, rather than on the vulnerabilities of 
specific segments of the population.<b>63</b> Submissions to this report and other studies indicate 
awareness of the need for more detailed assessments at the country level and point to some of the 
factors which affect individuals and communities. 
</p>
<p>44. The present section focuses on factors determining vulnerability to climate change for 
women, children and indigenous peoples. </p>
<p><b>1.  Women </b></p>
<p>45. Women are especially exposed to climate change-related risks due to existing gender 
discrimination, inequality and inhibiting gender roles. It is established that women, particularly 
elderly women and girls, are affected more severely and are more at risk during all phases of 
weather-related disasters: risk preparedness, warning communication and response, social and 
economic impacts, recovery and reconstruction.<b>64</b> The death rate of women is markedly higher 
than that of men during natural disasters (often linked to reasons such as: women are more likely 
to be looking after children, to be wearing clothes which inhibit movement and are less likely to 
be able to swim). This is particularly the case in disaster-affected societies in which the 
socio-economic status of women is low.<b>65</b> Women are susceptible to gender-based violence 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>62
</b>  See e.g. IPCC AR4 WGII Report, p. 374. 
</p>
<p><b>63
</b>  National communications, submitted according to arts. 4 and 12 of UNFCCC, make frequent 
</p>
<p>references to the human impacts of climate change, but generally do so in an aggregate and 
general manner, mentioning for example that people living in poverty are particularly vulnerable.

</b></p>
<p>  E. Neumayer and T. Pl&#252;mper, <i>The Gendered Nature of Natural Disasters: The Impact of 
Catastrophic Events on the Gender Gap in Life Expectancy, 1981-2002</i>, available at 
http://ssrn.com/abstract=874965. As the authors conclude, based on the study of disasters 
in 141 countries, &#8220;[a] systematic effect on the gender gap in life expectancy is only plausible if 
natural disasters exacerbate previously existing patterns of discrimination that render females 
more vulnerable to the fatal impact of disasters&#8221; (p. 27). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>during natural disasters and during migration, and girls are more likely to drop out of school 
when households come under additional stress. Rural women are particularly affected by effects 
on agriculture and deteriorating living conditions in rural areas. Vulnerability is exacerbated by 
factors such as unequal rights to property, exclusion from decision-making and difficulties in 
accessing information and financial services.<b>66 
</b></p>
<p>46. Studies document how crucial for successful climate change adaptation the knowledge and 
capacities of women are. For example, there are numerous examples of how measures to 
empower women and to address discriminatory practices have increased the capacity of 
communities to cope with extreme weather events.<b>67</b> 
</p>
<p>47. International human rights standards and principles underline the need to adequately assess 
and address the gender-differentiated impacts of climate change. In the context of negotiations 
on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, States have highlighted 
gender-specific vulnerability assessments as important elements in determining adaptation 
options.<b>68</b> Yet, there is a general lack of accurate data disaggregated by gender data in this area. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Children 
</b></p>
<p>48. Studies show that climate change will exacerbate existing health risks and undermine 
support structures that protect children from harm.<b>69</b> Overall, the health burden of climate change 
will primarily be borne by children in the developing world.<b>70</b> For example, extreme weather 
events and increased water stress already constitute leading causes of malnutrition and infant and 
child mortality and morbidity. Likewise, increased stress on livelihoods will make it more 
difficult for children to attend school. Girls will be particularly affected as traditional household 
chores, such as collecting firewood and water, require more time and energy when supplies 
are scarce. Moreover, like women, children have a higher mortality rate as a result of 
weather-related disasters.

<p>49. As today&#8217;s children and young persons will shape the world of tomorrow, children are 
central actors in promoting behaviour change required to mitigate the effects of global warming. 
Children&#8217;s knowledge and awareness of climate change also influence wider households and 
community actions.<b>71</b> Education on environmental matters among children is crucial and various 
initiatives at national and international levels seek to engage children and young people as actors 
in the climate change agenda.<b>72</b> 
</p>
<p>50. The Convention on the Rights of the Child, which enjoys near universal ratification, 
obliges States to take action to ensure the realization of all rights in the Convention for all 
children in their jurisdiction, including measures to safeguard children&#8217;s right to life, survival 
and development through, inter alia, addressing problems of environmental pollution and 
degradation. Importantly, children must be recognized as active participants and stewards of 
natural resources in the promotion and protection of a safe and healthy environment.<b>73</b> 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>51. Climate change, together with pollution and environmental degradation, poses a serious 
threat to indigenous peoples, who often live in marginal lands and fragile ecosystems which are 
particularly sensitive to alterations in the physical environment.<b>74</b> Climate change-related 
impacts have already led to the relocation of Inuit communities in polar regions and affected 
their traditional livelihoods. Indigenous peoples inhabiting low-lying island States face similar 
pressures, threatening their cultural identity which is closely linked to their traditional lands and 
livelihoods.<b>75</b> 
</p>
<p>52. Indigenous peoples have been voicing their concern about the impacts of climate change 
on their collective human rights and their rights as distinct peoples.<b>76</b> In particular, indigenous 
peoples have stressed the importance of giving them a voice in policymaking on climate change 
at both national and international levels and of taking into account and building upon their

<p>  In April 2008, the Permanent Forum for Indigenous Issues stated that climate change &#8220;is an 
urgent and immediate threat to human rights&#8221; (E/C.19/2008/13, para. 23). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>traditional knowledge.<b>77</b> As a study cited by the IPCC in its Fourth Assessment Report observes, 
&#8220;Incorporating indigenous knowledge into climate change policies can lead to the development 
of effective adaptation strategies that are cost-effective, participatory and sustainable&#8221;.<b>78</b> 
</p>
<p>53. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples sets out several rights 
and principles of relevance to threats posed by climate change.<b>79</b> Core international human rights 
treaties also provide for protection of indigenous peoples, in particular with regard to the right to 
self-determination and rights related to culture.<b>80</b> The rights of indigenous peoples are also 
enshrined in ILO Convention No. 169 (1989) concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in 
Independent Countries. 
</p>
<p>54. Indigenous peoples have brought several cases before national courts and regional and 
international human rights bodies claiming violations of human rights related to environmental 
issues. In 2005, a group of Inuit in the Canadian and Alaskan Arctic presented a case before the 
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights seeking compensation for alleged violations of 
their human rights resulting from climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions from the 
United States of America.<b>81 </b>While the Inter-American Commission deemed the case 
inadmissible, it drew international attention to the threats posed by climate change to indigenous 
peoples. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Displacement 
</b></p>
<p>55. The First Assessment Report of the IPCC (1990) noted that the greatest single impact of 
climate change might be on human migration. The report estimated that by 2050, 150 million 
people could be displaced by climate change-related phenomena, such as desertification,

<p><b>77
</b>  E/C.19/2008/13, para. 4. The Permanent Forum also recommended that a mechanism be put

<p>in place for the participation of indigenous peoples in climate change negotiations under 
UNFCCC (ibid., para. 30).

<p>  Key provisions include the right to effective mechanisms for prevention of, and redress for, 
actions which have the aim or effect of dispossessing them of their lands, territories or resources 
(art. 8); the principle of free, prior and informed consent (art. 19), the right to the conservation 
and protection of the environment and indigenous lands and territories (art. 29), the right to

displacement will primarily occur within countries and that it will affect primarily poorer regions 
and countries.<b>83</b> 
</p>
<p>56. It is possible to distinguish between four main climate change-related displacement 
scenarios,<b>84</b> where displacement is caused by: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Weather-related disasters, such as hurricanes and flooding 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Gradual environmental deterioration and slow onset disasters, such as desertification, 
sinking of coastal zones and possible total submersion of low-lying island States 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Increased disaster risks resulting in relocation of people from high-risk zones 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Social upheaval and violence attributable to climate change-related factors

<p>57. Persons affected by displacement within national borders are entitled to the full range of 
human rights guarantees by a given State,<b>85</b> including protection against arbitrary or forced 
displacement and rights related to housing and property restitution for displaced persons.<b>86</b> 
To the extent that movement has been forced, persons would also qualify for increased assistance 
and protection as a vulnerable group in accordance with the Guiding Principles on Internal

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Displacement.<b>87</b> However, with regard to slow-onset disasters and environmental degradation 
it remains challenging to distinguish between voluntary and forced population movements. 
</p>
<p>58. Persons moving voluntarily or forcibly across an international border due to environmental 
factors would be entitled to general human rights guarantees in a receiving State, but would often 
not have a right of entry to that State. Persons forcibly displaced across borders for 
environmental reasons have been referred to as &#8220;climate refugees&#8221; or &#8220;environmental refugees&#8221;. 
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International 
Organization for Migration and other humanitarian organizations have advised that these terms 
have no legal basis in international refugee law and should be avoided in order not to undermine 
the international legal regime for the protection of refugees.<b>88</b> 
</p>
<p>59. The Representative of the Secretary-General on human rights of internally displaced 
persons has suggested that a person who cannot be reasonably expected to return (e.g. if 
assistance and protection provided by the country of origin is far below international standards) 
should be considered a victim of forced displacement and be granted at least a temporary stay.<b>89 
</b></p>
<p>60. One possible scenario of forcible displacement across national borders is the eventual total 
submergence of small island States.<b>90 </b>Two working papers of the Sub-Commission on the 
Promotion and Protection of Human Rights point to some of the human rights issues such 
situations would raise, such as the rights of affected populations vis-&#224;-vis receiving States and 
possible entitlement to live in community.<b>91</b> Human rights law does not provide clear answers as 
to the status of populations who have been displaced from sinking island States. Arguably,

<p>  In the face of rising sea levels, migration is one adaptation strategy which is already 
being implemented in low-lying island States, such as Kiribati, the Maldives, and Tuvalu. 
So far this population movement has mainly taken the form of in-country resettlement schemes 
(IPCC AR4 WGII Report, p. 708). 
<b>91
</b></p>
<p>  The papers (E/CN.4/Sub.2/AC.4/2004/CRP.1; E/CN.4/Sub.2/2005/28) were prepared 
by Fran&#231;oise Hampson pursuant to a request from the Commission on Human Rights 
(decision 2004/122) to prepare a report on the legal implications of the disappearance  
of States for environmental reasons. A questionnaire was prepared in 2006 
(E/CN.4/Sub.2/AC.4/2006/CRP.2) with a view to obtaining more accurate data on the nature, 
scale and imminence of the problem, but as yet no follow-up has been given to this initiative. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>dealing with such possible disasters and protecting the human rights of the people affected will 
first and foremost require adequate long-term political solutions, rather than new legal 
instruments.<b>92</b> 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Conflict and security risks 
</b></p>
<p>61. Recent reports and studies identify climate change as a key challenge to global peace and 
stability.<b>93</b> This was also recognized by the Norwegian Nobel Committee when, in 2007, it 
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize jointly to the IPCC and Al Gore for raising awareness of 
man-made climate change.<b>94</b> Equally, in 2007, the Security Council held a day-long debate on 
the impact of climate change on peace and security. 
</p>
<p>62. According to one study, the effects of climate change interacting with economic, social and 
political problems will create a high risk of violent conflict in 46 countries - home to 2.7 billion 
people.<b>95</b> These countries, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and Latin America, are also the 
countries which are particularly exposed to projected negative impacts of climate change. 
63. Climate change-related conflicts could be one driver of forced displacement. In such cases, 
in addition to the general human rights protection framework, other international standards 
would be applicable, including the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, international 
humanitarian law, international refugee law and subsidiary and temporary protection regimes for 
persons fleeing from armed conflict. Violent conflict, irrespective of its causes, has direct 
implications for the protection and enjoyment of human rights.

</b>  This point was made by Ms. Hampson and other panellists at the consultation meeting

<p>  As the Chairman of the Nobel Committee stated: &#8220;The chief threats may be direct violence, 
but deaths may also have less direct sources in starvation, disease, or natural disasters&#8221; 
(Presentation speech 10 December 2007).<i> 
<b></b></i><b>95
</b></p>
<p>  International Alert and Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), 
<i>A Climate of Conflict</i>, 2008, p. 7. In the same vein, the Special Rapporteur on the right to food 
observes that conflicts in Africa, including in the Darfur region, are linked to land degradation 
and related fights over resources (A/HRC/7/5, para. 51). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>64. It should be noted, however, that knowledge remains limited as to the causal linkages 
between environmental factors and conflict and there is little empirical evidence to substantiate 
the projected impacts of environmental factors on armed conflict.<b>96</b> 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Human rights implications of response measures </b></p>
<p>65. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol 
commit States parties to minimize adverse economic, social and environmental impacts resulting 
from the implementation of measures taken to mitigate or adapt to climate change impacts 
(&#8220;response measures&#8221;).<b>97</b> With regard to measures to reduce the concentration of greenhouse 
gases in the atmosphere (mitigation), agro-fuel production is one example of how mitigation 
measures may have adverse secondary effects on human rights, especially the right to food.<b>98</b> 
</p>
<p>66. Whereas agro-fuel production could bring positive benefits for climate change and for 
farmers in developing countries, agro-fuels have also contributed to increasing the price of food 
commodities &#8220;because of the competition between food, feed and fuel for scarce arable land&#8221;.<b>99</b> 
CESCR has urged States to implement strategies to combat global climate change that do not 
negatively affect the right to adequate food and freedom from hunger, but rather promote 
sustainable agriculture, as required by article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change.<b>100</b> 
</p>
<p>67. Apart from the impact on the right to food, concerns have also been raised that demand for 
biofuels could encroach on the rights of indigenous peoples to their traditional lands and 
culture.<b>101</b> 
</p>
<p>

</b>  See e.g. H. Buhaug, N.P. Gleditsch and O.M. Theisen, <i>Implications of Climate Change 
</i></p>
<p><i>for Armed Conflict</i>, 2008. As the IPCC AR4 WGII Report points out (citing Fairhead, 2004) 
there are many other intervening and contributing causes of conflict and many  
environmentally-influenced conflicts in Africa are related to abundance of natural resources 
(e.g. oil and diamonds) rather than scarcity, suggesting &#8220;caution in the prediction of such 
conflicts as a result of climate change&#8221; (p. 365).

<p>  See e.g. M. Macchi and others, <i>Indigenous and Traditional Peoples and Climate Change</i>, 
International Union for Conservation of Nature, 2008. CERD expressed concern about plans to 
establish a large-scale biofuel plantation and the threat it constituted to the rights of indigenous 
peoples to own their lands and enjoy their culture (CERD/C/IDN/CO/3, para. 17). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>68. Concerns have also been raised about possible adverse effects of reduced emissions from 
deforestation and degradation (REDD) programmes. These programmes provide compensation 
for retaining forest cover and could potentially benefit indigenous peoples who depend on those 
forest resources. However, indigenous communities fear expropriation of their lands and 
displacement and have concerns about the current framework for REDD. The Permanent Forum 
on Indigenous Issues stated that new proposals for reduced emissions from deforestation &#8220;must 
address the need for global and national policy reforms &#8230; respecting rights to land, territories 
and resources, and the rights of self-determination and the free, prior and informed consent of the 
indigenous peoples concerned&#8221;.<b>102</b> 
</p>
<p><b>III.  RELEVANT HUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>69. There exists broad agreement that climate change has generally negative effects on the 
realization of human rights. This section seeks to outline how the empirical reality and 
projections of the adverse effects of climate change on the effective enjoyment of human rights 
relate to obligations assumed by States under the international human rights treaties. 
</p>
<p>70. While climate change has obvious implications for the enjoyment of human rights, it is less 
obvious whether, and to what extent, such effects can be qualified as human rights violations in a 
strict legal sense.<b>103</b> Qualifying the effects of climate change as human rights violations poses a 
series of difficulties. First, it is virtually impossible to disentangle the complex causal 
relationships linking historical greenhouse gas emissions of a particular country with a specific 
climate change-related effect, let alone with the range of direct and indirect implications for 
human rights. Second, global warming is often one of several contributing factors to climate 
change-related effects, such as hurricanes, environmental degradation and water stress. 
Accordingly, it is often impossible to establish the extent to which a concrete climate 
change-related event with implications for human rights is attributable to global warming. Third, 
adverse effects of global warming are often projections about future impacts, whereas human 
rights violations are normally established after the harm has occurred.<b>104</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>102
</b>  E/C.19/2008/13, para. 45. 
</p>
<p><b>103
</b>  In recent years, several lawsuits related to greenhouse gas emissions and their contribution to 
</p>
<p>climate change have been filed at national level against State authorities and private 
actors. However, the Inuit petition to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights 
(see footnote 81 above) remains the only case to have invoked human rights law. For an 
overview of recent climate change-related lawsuits, see e.g. International Council for 
Human Rights Policy, <i>Climate Change and Human Rights: A Rough Guide</i>, 2008. 
<b>104
</b></p>
<p>  The Human Rights Committee has clarified that for a person to claim to be a victim of a 
violation of a right, &#8220;he or she must show either that an act or an omission of a State party has 
already adversely affected his or her enjoyment of such a right, or that such an effect is 
imminent &#8230;&#8221; <i>Aalbersberg v. The Netherlands</i> (No. 1440/2005). In several cases concerning 
environmental harms, the Committee has found that the author(s) did not meet these criteria for a 
victim of a human rights violation. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>71. Irrespective of whether or not climate change effects can be construed as human rights 
violations, human rights obligations provide important protection to the individuals whose rights 
are affected by climate change or by measures taken to respond to climate change. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  National level obligations 
</b></p>
<p>72. Under international human rights law, individuals rely first and foremost on their own 
States for the protection of their human rights. In the face of climate change, however, it is 
doubtful, for the reasons mentioned above, that an individual would be able to hold a particular 
State responsible for harm caused by climate change. Human rights law provides more effective 
protection with regard to measures taken by States to address climate change and their impact on 
human rights. 
</p>
<p>73. For example, if individuals have to move away from a high-risk zone, the State must 
ensure adequate safeguards and take measures to avoid forced evictions. Equally, several claims 
about environmental harm have been considered by national, regional and international judicial 
and quasi-judicial bodies, including the Human Rights Committee, regarding the impact on 
human rights, such as the right to life, to heath, to privacy and family life and to information.<b>105</b> 
Similar cases in which an environmental harm is linked to climate change could also be 
considered by courts and quasi-judicial human rights treaty bodies. In such cases, it would 
appear that the matter of the case would rest on whether the State through its acts or omissions 
had failed to protect an individual against a harm affecting the enjoyment of human rights. 
74. In some cases, States may have an obligation to protect individuals against foreseeable 
threats to human rights related to climate change, such as an increased risk of flooding in certain 
areas. In that regard, the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights gives some 
indication of how a failure to take measures against foreseeable risks could possibly amount to a 
violation of human rights. The Court found a violation of the right to life in a case where State 
authorities had failed to implement land-planning and emergency relief policies while they were 
aware of an increasing risk of a large-scale mudslide. The Court also noted that the population 
had not been adequately informed about the risk.<b>106</b>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Progressive realization of economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>75. As discussed in chapter II, climate change will have implications for a number of 
economic, social and cultural rights. As specified in the relevant treaty provisions, States are 
obliged to take measures towards the full realization of economic, social and cultural rights to 
the maximum extent of their available resources.<b>107</b> As climate change will place an additional 
burden on the resources available to States, economic and social rights are likely to suffer. 
</p>
<p>76. While international human rights treaties recognize that some aspects of economic, social 
and cultural rights may only be realized progressively over time, they also impose obligations 
which require immediate implementation. First, States parties must take deliberate, concrete and 
targeted measures, making the most efficient use of available resources, to move as expeditiously 
and effectively as possible towards the full realization of rights.<b>108</b> Second, irrespective of 
resource limitations, States must guarantee non-discrimination in access to economic, social and 
cultural rights. Third, States have a core obligation to ensure, at the very least, minimum 
essential levels of each right enshrined in the Covenant. For example, a State party in which &#8220;any 
significant number of individuals is deprived of essential foodstuffs, of essential primary health 
care, of basic shelter and housing, or of the most basic forms of education&#8221; would be failing to 
meet its minimum core obligations and, prima facie, be in violation of the Covenant.<b>109</b> 
</p>
<p>77. In sum, irrespective of the additional strain climate change-related events may place on 
available resources, States remain under an obligation to ensure the widest possible enjoyment of 
economic, social and cultural rights under any given circumstances. Importantly, States must, as 
a matter of priority, seek to satisfy core obligations and protect groups in society who are in a 
particularly vulnerable situation.<b>110</b> 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Access to information and participation in decision-making 
</b></p>
<p>78. Awareness-raising and access to information are critical to efforts to address climate 
change. For example, it is critically important that early-warning information be provided in a 
manner accessible to all sectors of society. Under the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change, the parties commit to promote and facilitate public access to information on 
climate change.<b>111</b> Under international human rights law, access to information is implied in the 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>107
</b>  See CESCR general comment No. 3 (1990) on the nature of States parties&#8217; obligations (art. 2, 
</p>
<p>para. 1, of the Covenant). For a discussion of the concept of progressive realization under the 
international human rights treaties, see report of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights to the Economic and Social Council (E/2007/82). 
<b>108
</b></p>
<p>  See e.g. CESCR general comments No. 3, paras. 2 and 9, and No. 14 (2000) on the right to

<p>  UNFCCC, art. 6. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>rights to freedom of opinion and expression.<b>112</b> Jurisprudence of regional human rights courts has 
also underlined the importance of access to information in relation to environmental risks.<b>113</b> 
</p>
<p>79. Participation in decision-making is of key importance in efforts to tackle climate change. 
For example, adequate and meaningful consultation with affected persons should precede 
decisions to relocate people away from hazardous zones.<b>114</b> Under the Convention, States parties 
shall promote and facilitate &#8220;public participation in addressing climate change and its effects and 
developing adequate responses&#8221;.<b>115 </b>The right to participation in decision-making is implied in 
article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which guarantees the right 
to &#8220;take part in the conduct of public affairs&#8221;. Equally, the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples states that States shall consult and cooperate with indigenous 
peoples &#8220;to obtain their free, prior and informed consent&#8221; before adopting measures that may 
affect them.<b>116 </b>The Convention on the Rights of the Child in article 12 enshrines the right of 
children to express their views freely in all matters affecting them. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Guiding principles for policymaking 
</b></p>
<p>80. Human rights standards and principles should inform and strengthen policymaking in the 
area of climate change, promoting policy coherence and sustainable outcomes. The human rights 
framework draws attention to the importance of aligning climate change policies and measures 
with overall human rights objectives, including through assessing possible effects of such 
policies and measures on human rights. 
</p>
<p>81. Moreover, looking at climate change vulnerability and adaptive capacity in human rights 
terms highlights the importance of analysing power relationships, addressing underlying causes 
of inequality and discrimination, and gives particular attention to marginalized and vulnerable 
members of society. The human rights framework seeks to empower individuals and 
underlines the critical importance of effective participation of individuals and communities in 
decision-making processes affecting their lives.

<p>  United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, art. 19. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>82. Equally, human rights standards underline the need to prioritize access of all persons to at 
least basic levels of economic, social and cultural rights, such as access to basic medical care, 
essential drugs and to compulsory primary education free of charge. 
</p>
<p>83. The human rights framework also stresses the importance of accountability mechanisms in 
the implementation of measures and policies in the area of climate change and requires access to 
administrative and judicial remedies in cases of human rights violations.<b>117</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Obligations of international cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>84. Climate change can only be effectively addressed through cooperation of all members of 
the international community.<b>118</b> Moreover, international cooperation is important because the 
effects and risk of climate change are significantly higher in low-income countries. 
</p>
<p>85. International cooperation to promote and protect human rights lies at the heart of the 
Charter of the United Nations.<b>119</b> The importance of such cooperation is explicitly stated in 
provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities 
and in the Declaration on the Right to Development.<b>120</b> According to CESCR and the Committee  
on the Rights of the Child, the obligation to take steps to the maximum of available resources to 
implement economic, social and cultural rights includes an obligation of States, where necessary, 
to seek international cooperation.<b>121</b> States have also committed themselves not only to

States, and the impacts of actions by States, are ever more interconnected. New challenges 
include ensuring global access to food, and those presented by climate change and financial 
crisis have potentially massive human rights and development implications. If we are to confront 
them effectively we must do so collectively.&#8221;

</p>
<p>implement the treaties within their jurisdiction, but also to contribute, through international 
cooperation, to global implementation.<b>122</b> Developed States have a particular responsibility and 
interest to assist the poorer developing States.<b>123</b> 
</p>
<p>86. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights identifies four types of 
extraterritorial obligations to promote and protect economic, social and cultural rights. 
Accordingly, States have legal obligations to: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Refrain from interfering with the enjoyment of human rights in other countries 
&#8226; Take measures to prevent third parties (e.g. private companies) over which they hold 
</p>
<p>influence from interfering with the enjoyment of human rights in other countries 
&#8226; Take steps through international assistance and cooperation, depending on the 
</p>
<p>availability of resources, to facilitate fulfilment of human rights in other countries, 
including disaster relief, emergency assistance, and assistance to refugees and displaced 
persons 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensure that human rights are given due attention in international agreements and that 
such agreements do not adversely impact upon human rights<b>124</b> 
</p>
<p>87. Human rights standards and principles are consistent with and further emphasize &#8220;the 
principle of common but differentiated responsibilities&#8221; contained in the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change. According to this principle, developed country 
Parties (annex I) commit to assisting developing country Parties (non-annex I) in meeting the 
costs of adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change and to take full account of the 
specific needs of least developed countries in funding and transfer of technology.<b>125</b> The human 
rights framework complements the Convention by underlining that &#8220;the human person is the 
central subject of development&#8221;,<b>126 </b>and that international cooperation is not merely a matter of 
the obligations of a State towards other States, but also of the obligations towards individuals.

<p><b>124

</p>
<p>No. 13 (1999) on the right to education (art. 13); No. 14 (2000) on the right to the highest 
attainable standard of health (art. 12); and No. 15 (2002) on the right to water (arts. 11 and 12 of 
the Covenant).

 <p> 
</p>
<p>88. Human rights standards and principles, underpinned by universally recognized moral 
values, can usefully inform debates on equity and fair distribution of mitigation and adaptation 
burdens. Above all, human rights principles and standards focus attention on how a given 
distribution of burden affects the enjoyment of human rights. 
<b>Intergenerational equity and the precautionary principle 
</b></p>
<p>89. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change stresses principles of 
particular importance in the context of climate change which are less well developed in human 
rights law. Notably, these include the notion of &#8220;intergenerational equity and justice&#8221; and &#8220;the 
precautionary principle&#8221;, both of which are well-established in international environmental law. 
</p>
<p>90. Human rights treaty bodies have alluded to the notion of intergenerational equity.<b>127</b> 
However, the human rights principles of equality and non-discrimination generally focus on 
situations in the present, even if it is understood that the value of these core human rights 
principles would not diminish over time and be equally applicable to future generations.<b>128</b> 
</p>
<p>91. The precautionary principle reflected in article 3 of the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change, states that lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a 
reason for postponing precautionary measures to anticipate, prevent or minimize the causes of 
climate change and mitigate its adverse effects. As discussed above, human rights litigation is 
not well-suited to promote precautionary measures based on risk assessments, unless such risks 
pose an imminent threat to the human rights of specific individuals. Yet, by drawing attention to 
the broader human rights implications of climate change risks, the human rights perspective, in 
line with the precautionary principle, emphasizes the need to avoid unnecessary delay in taking 
action to contain the threat of global warming. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>Climate change-related impacts, as set out in the assessment reports of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, have a range of implications for the effective 
enjoyment of human rights. The effects on human rights can be of a direct nature, such as 
the threat extreme weather events may pose to the right to life, but will often have an 
indirect and gradual effect on human rights, such as increasing stress on health systems 
and vulnerabilities related to climate change-induced migration.

<p><b>127
</b>  See CESCR general comments No. 12, para. 7, and No. 15, para. 11. Equally the concern for 
</p>
<p>how current needs and rights affect the future health and development of the child is central to 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child (see e.g. Committee on the Rights of the Child general 
comment No. 4 (2003) on adolescent health and development in the context of the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child, para. 13).

 <p> 
</p>
<p>93. <b>The effects of climate change are already being felt</b> <b>by individuals and communities 
around the world. Particularly vulnerable are those living on the &#8220;front line&#8221; of climate 
change, in places where even small climatic changes can have catastrophic consequences 
for lives and livelihoods. Vulnerability due to geography is often compounded by a low 
capacity to adapt, rendering many of the poorest countries and communities particularly 
vulnerable to the effects of climate change. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Within countries, existing vulnerabilities are exacerbated by the effects of climate 
change. Groups such as children, women, the elderly and persons with disabilities are often 
particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change on the enjoyment of their 
human rights. The application of a human rights approach in preventing and responding 
to the effects of climate change serves to empower individuals and groups, who should be 
perceived as active agents of change and not as passive victims. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Often the effects of climate change on human rights are determined by non-climatic 
factors, including discrimination and unequal power relationships. This underlines the 
importance of addressing human rights threats posed by climate change through 
adequate policies and measures which are coherent with overall human rights objectives. 
Human rights standards and principles should inform and strengthen policy measures in 
the area of climate change. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The physical impacts of global warming cannot easily be classified as human rights 
violations, not least because climate change-related harm often cannot clearly be attributed 
to acts or omissions of specific States. Yet, addressing that harm remains a critical human 
rights concern and obligation under international law. Hence, legal protection remains 
relevant as a safeguard against climate change-related risks and infringements of human 
rights resulting from policies and measures taken at the national level to address climate 
change.  
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>There is a need for more detailed studies and data collection at country level in order 
to assess the human rights impact of climate change-related phenomena and of policies and 
measures adopted to address climate change. In this regard, States could usefully provide 
information on measures to assess and address vulnerabilities and impacts related to 
climate change as they affect individuals and groups, in reporting to the United Nations 
human rights treaty monitoring bodies and the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>Further study is also needed of protection mechanisms for persons who may be 
considered to have been displaced within or across national borders due to climate 
change-related events and for those populations which may be permanently displaced as a 
consequence of inundation of low-lying areas and island States. 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>Global warming can only be dealt with through cooperation by all members of the 
international community. Equally, international assistance is required to ensure 
sustainable development pathways in developing countries and enable them to adapt to 
now unavoidable climate change. International human rights law complements the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change by underlining that 
international cooperation is not only expedient but also a human rights obligation and that 
its central objective is the realization of human rights.</b> </p>
