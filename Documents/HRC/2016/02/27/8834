<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its sixth session from 30 
November to 11 December 2009.  The review of the Dominican Republic was held at the 
3rd meeting, on 1 December 2009.  The delegation of the Dominican Republic was headed 
by Dr. Max Puig, Secretary of State for Labour. At its 7th meeting held on 3 December 
2009, the Working Group adopted the present report on the Dominican Republic.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>2. On 7 September 2009, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of the Dominican Republic: Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, Bangladesh and Argentina. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Dominican Republic: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/6/ DOM/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/6/DOM/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/6/DOM/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Germany, the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Latvia, Switzerland, and the 
Netherlands was transmitted to the Dominican Republic through the troika.  These 
questions are available on the extranet of the Working Group.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. At the 3rd meeting, on 1 December 2009, the Secretary of State for Labour opened 
his statement by indicating that the national report is the result of intensive efforts 
undertaken by the Government with great responsibility and broad participation.  
</p>
<p>6. He recalled that the Dominican Republic has ratified the major international human 
rights conventions, which are part of the nation&#8217;s legal framework. He added that the 
Government is carrying out the necessary studies to promptly determine the possibility of 
accession to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment (CAT) and the International Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (ICRMW).  
</p>
<p>7. The Secretary of State for Labour highlighted that since the 1960s significant 
progress has been made in the field of human rights. However, it is important to bear in 
mind that this progressive improvement takes place against a structural backdrop of long-
standing poverty and immigration. In that context, he presented some of the achievements 
of recent years and referred to persisting challenges. 
</p>
<p>8. With regard to the issues of documentation and nationality, in 2004 the Government 
estimated that there were approximately 600,000 unregistered nationals. In order to rectify 
this situation, the Late Registration Unit (<i>Unidad de Declaraciones Tard&#237;as</i>) was </p>


<p>relaunched and in August 2007, Congress passed Act No. 218-07, which established a 
three-year amnesty for late birth registrations for nationals under the age of 16. 
</p>
<p>9. The delegation explained that in April 2007, a birth registration system known as the 
Immigration Registry was established for children born in the Dominican Republic to non-
resident women. In cases where the nationality of a newborn child or minor is unknown, the 
State confers Dominican nationality upon that person in accordance with the 1961 
Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. 
</p>
<p>10. The delegation stressed that discrimination on the basis of race, nationality, gender, 
creed or age is not accepted in the Dominican Republic. The 1997 amended Criminal Code 
makes discrimination or attacks against another person a criminal offence. In addition, any 
person who feels that he or she has been discriminated against or that his or her rights have 
been violated has preferential access to the courts. 
</p>
<p>11. The Dominican Republic mentioned that women enjoy equal rights and privileges 
with men and that with a view to guaranteeing and strengthening these rights the principle 
of positive discrimination has been introduced in the political arena. To this end, it was 
established by law that at least one third of candidates for elective posts should be women.  
</p>
<p>12. With regard to the rights to public security, personal security and due process before 
the law, the State indicated that there have been no reports of political crimes or 
disappearances between 2003 and 2008. However, it regretted that during that same period, 
there were reports of private individuals' involvement in summary executions.  There have 
also been reports of members of the police and armed forces physically abusing detainees. 
The Government has taken penal action to counter these abuses and to ensure that they are 
not repeated.  
</p>
<p>13. In 1997 a reform process was initiated with a view to guaranteeing the independence 
of the judiciary.  Special emphasis has been placed on the training and human rights 
instruction of members of the armed forces and police corps.  In addition, the new 
penitentiary model protects prisoners' dignity and prison facilities are being upgraded to 
reduce overcrowding.  
</p>
<p>14. The delegation indicated that the persistence of trafficking in persons and people-
smuggling is of great concern.  A series of measures was undertaken by the Government to 
combat this problem, including, among others, the establishment of the National 
Commission to Combat Human Trafficking and People-Smuggling, which has the task of 
developing a national strategy in this area. The delegation added that the Inter-Agency 
Commission to Combat Abuse and Sexual Exploitation for Commercial Purposes joins 
forces with the Public Prosecutor's office and the Special Prosecutor for Children and 
Youth in combating the sexual exploitation of adolescents in tourist areas. It also 
emphasized that trafficking in girls and women, particularly for purposes of sexual 
exploitation, is taken very seriously and that networks of traffickers operating in the 
country are pursued by a wide array of government and civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p>15. According to the delegation, there are an estimated 900,000 to 1.2 million illegal 
migrants in the Dominican Republic, mostly of Haitian nationality. The Government does 
not encourage, benefit from or remain indifferent to this illegal migratory flow, which has 
many consequences.  A number of steps have been taken to regulate this flow, including the 
passage of Act No. 137-03 on human trafficking and migrant-smuggling and of Migration 
Act No. 285-04.  
</p>
<p>16. The delegation recognized that despite the fact that gender equality prevails in the 
Dominican Republic, problems such as domestic violence and violence targeting women 
persist. The Government has therefore adopted the National Gender Equity and Equality </p>


<p>Plan to promote the rights of women. To ensure that the Plan is followed up, it has also 
established gender equity and development offices in all Government branches. 
</p>
<p>17. On the subject of children&#8217;s rights, the delegation reported that the Labour Code and 
subsequent regulations issued by the Ministry of Labour prohibit the employment of 
children under 14 and protect children under 18 from the worst forms of child labour. The 
State regretted that violations of the law and regulations in this area still occur.  
</p>
<p>18. Under the national strategic plan for the eradication of the worst forms of child 
labour, 27,300 children have already been removed from risky situations and work 
exploitation. The authorities have launched an additional programme, which has achieved a 
significant decrease in the number of children and teenagers exposed and subjected to the 
worst forms of child labour. 
</p>
<p>19. In its efforts to ensure that all minors attend school, in 2003 the Ministry of 
Education authorized undocumented school-aged children to attend the compulsory basic 
years of education. Furthermore, a programme that offers subsidies to needy families in 
exchange for acceptance that their children of school age will attend school has been 
established and benefited more than 208,000 families in 2008.  
</p>
<p>20. With regard to the right to work, the Dominican Republic stressed that all workers 
are free to organize and join the union of their choice and that the Labour Code establishes 
a system of labour tribunals to handle disputes. 
</p>
<p>21. The State referred to reports from a number of non-governmental organizations 
indicating that, between 2003 and 2008, most of the undocumented Haitian workers 
employed in various farming and construction ventures did not assert their rights for fear of 
being dismissed or deported. The State explained that for every reported case there are 
dozens of counter-examples. 
</p>
<p>22. The Government indicated that its priorities in giving effect to the right to work are 
the creation of more and better jobs, the eradication of forced labour and child labour and 
the promotion of social dialogue. 
</p>
<p>23. Although the Dominican Republic has not been able to eradicate poverty, it has 
implemented important programmes in this area, such as &#8220;Eating Comes First&#8221; (<i>Comer es 
Primero</i>), which has become an integral part of the Solidarity Programme. By means of its 
electronic debit card, the Solidarity Programme ensures that citizens living in extreme 
poverty have their education, health, transport and nutritional needs met and that the elderly 
are cared for.  
</p>
<p>24. The Dominican Republic indicated that the establishment of the new social security 
system has been one of the most significant achievements in recent years. The coverage 
under the subsidized family health insurance scheme for the poor has risen from 65,000 
beneficiaries in mid-2004 to 1,224,643 people nationwide. In addition, the undocumented 
population can benefit from free medical care. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>25. The great challenge regarding education in the country is related to its quality, since 
the Dominican Republic has the second-highest school enrolment rate in Latin America, 
with 91.1 per cent of children between 6 and 18 attending school. A 10-year plan for the 
period 2008-2018 has been elaborated for all levels of education, and the Government has 
supported a gradual increase in the budget for the education sector.   
</p>
<p>26. Referring to vulnerable groups, the Government indicated that, despite efforts made 
over the last 40 years to counter poverty in the countryside, rural dwellers are the most 
vulnerable social group when it comes to unequal distribution of opportunities and wealth.  
</p>
<p>27. As regards food security, not even the second part of the first of the eight 
Millennium Development Goals -- halving the proportion of people suffering from hunger </p>


<p>in the country -- has been achieved. The Government is developing programmes with a 
view to resolving this issue in a satisfactory manner.   
</p>
<p>28. In relation to the rights of migrants, the Dominican Republic emphasized that it was 
firmly and resolutely opposed to any kind of shady arrangement or abuse at the expense of 
migrant workers, particularly illegal ones. The authorities are faced with the challenge of 
regulating migration so that migrant workers are legal, do not exceed the demand for 
labour, contribute positively and do not become an instrument of unfair business practice or 
an unsustainable burden on society. The General Directorate on Migration has laid down 
the terms under which illegal Haitians can be repatriated in the protocol which Haiti and the 
Dominican Republic signed in 1999.  
</p>
<p>29. The delegation recalled that the Dominican Republic will soon promulgate a new 
Constitution, marking a milestone in the history of the country. The new constitutional text 
is modern and rights- based, and will contribute to solving institutional problems. 
Moreover, it significantly expands the catalogue of fundamental rights and incorporates the 
institution of ombudsman. 
</p>
<p>30. Taken together, the achievements of the past few decades show that progress in 
overcoming the obstacles that prevent men and women of all ages, social classes, races and 
nationalities from living together in dignity depends directly on an active undertaking by 
the Government and society to protect and promote basic rights. 
</p>
<p>31. In this context, the formal commitment made by the Dominican Republic is to 
continue to put into effect each and every initiative designed to foster compliance with all 
its national and international human rights commitments. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>32. During the interactive dialogue, statements were made by 38 delegations. A number 
of delegations thanked the Dominican Republic for its commitment to the universal 
periodic review process and its comprehensive, self-critical national report, noting that the 
report was the result of an inclusive broad-based process with the contributions of civil 
society organizations.  Recommendations made during the interactive dialogue are to be 
found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>33. Algeria welcomed the Secretary of State for Labour and his accompanying 
delegation. Algeria commended the national report for uncompromisingly recognizing that 
inequality was a historical characteristic of the socio-economic makeup of the Dominican 
Republic, and that it underlined social exclusion of national and foreigners. Algeria made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34. While noting the positive steps already taken by the Dominican Republic in 
combating violence against women, human trafficking and extrajudicial killings, Turkey 
recalled that certain areas still require more attention and action. Turkey mentioned as 
examples the high rate of population living below the poverty line and the number of 
irregular migrants in the country. Nevertheless, Turkey praised the efforts made towards the 
elimination of impunity, the fight against racial discrimination and xenophobia and the 
ongoing screening and training of all law enforcement personnel and national security 
forces. Turkey made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. Belgium referred to the immigration flow of a large number of Haitians, which 
Belgium recognized as a major challenge. It welcomed a number of initiatives taken by the 
Dominican authorities in this area, such as the zero tolerance policy concerning violations 
of the rights of migrants. It was, however, alarmed by the general treatment of asylum-
seekers and refugees and considered that the Dominican Republic had not fully followed up </p>


<p>on the comments and requests coming from the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms 
of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, the Independent Expert 
on minority issues and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. 
Belgium stressed the importance of raising awareness among public officials to combat 
racism and of reprimanding the racist actions taken by these agents. Belgium asked what 
measures the Government planned to take to combat this phenomenon among public 
authorities. Belgium made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>36. Canada welcomed the ratification by the state of the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities.  Canada noted with concern reports of discriminatory denial of 
the right to nationality to Dominicans of Haitian descent. Canada also recognized the 
efforts of the State to combat trafficking of children, women and men and appreciated its 
cooperation with Canada in the arrest of human traffickers. Canada made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>37. Egypt commended the creation of a new mechanism within the Offices of the 
Ombudsmen and dispute mediation centres in cooperation with the Office of the Attorney 
General and civil society organizations. It highlighted the establishment in October 2007 of 
the National Commission to Combat Human Trafficking and People-Smuggling. It also 
welcomed the 2006-2007 undertaking of a national consultation on excellence in education 
and the drawing up a 10 year plan for all levels of education in the country and its 
commitment to put the plan into operation over the period 2008-2018. Egypt made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. Brazil recognized the significant efforts made in the area of human rights, reflected 
by the establishment of the Interagency Commission for Human Rights and the Institute of 
promotion and protection of Human Rights and by the prohibition of corporal punishment 
at schools and in the judiciary system.  Brazil congratulated the Dominican Republic for its 
launching of a national strategy on social inclusion.  It welcomed the establishment of a 
bilateral commission between the Dominican Republic and Haiti. However, Brazil 
expressed its concerns with regard to issues related to gender violence and migrants. Brazil 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>39. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland noted the absence of a 
national human rights institution in line with the Paris Principles. While welcoming the 
progress made in modernizing the prison system, it remained concerned about problematic 
conditions in the old-style prisons, including overcrowding, poor hygiene and criminality, 
and poorly trained personnel. It was concerned about the allegations of unlawful killings 
and increasing violence committed by Dominican security forces, and the absence of 
independent and transparent investigations. With regard to racism and discrimination 
against Haitians and Dominicans of Haitian descent, the United Kingdom recalled the 
importance of equality to all in access to health care, education and freedom of movement. 
The United Kingdom made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>40. Cuba noted positively the efforts being made to address the combat and eliminate all 
forms of discrimination, such as affirmative actions establishing quotas for women to be 
elected to public positions, the adoption of a National Plan for Gender Equality and 
measures to establish preferential access to the courts for victims of any type of 
discrimination.  Cuba further noted with interest the programmes being implemented to 
address the problem of exclusion and lack of attention to the most impoverished sectors of 
the population, in particular the programme &#8220;Eating Comes First&#8221;. Cuba made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>41. Spain noted the efforts made by the Dominican Republic in the area of fundamental 
rights and freedoms. Furthermore, Spain welcomed the abolition of the death penalty and 
expressed its hope that the Dominican Republic would ratify the Second Optional Protocol </p>


<p>to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Spain asked whether the 
Government planned to broaden the campaign of gender equality and whether it would take 
measures in cases of abuses perpetrated by security forces. Spain made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. France inquired about the measures that the authorities intended to take to cope with 
the increasing incidents of arbitrary detention, summary executions and the use of excessive 
force by law enforcement officials as well as the impunity they seemed to benefit from. 
While acknowledging the significant progress made in the area of the rights of women, 
France added that domestic violence was still at a very alarming level and the units of 
fighting violence against women seemed not to be very effective due to the lack of 
receptivity of the police officers on this subject. Under those circumstances, what additional 
measures did the authorities intend to take to guarantee full respect of the rights of women?  
Referring to more than a million Haitian citizens living in the Dominican Republic without 
documentation, which made them particularly vulnerable and exposed them to many forms 
of exploitation, France was very pleased that the Dominican Government had announced in 
June 2009 the launching of a broad plan to regularize them by providing them with resident 
permits and work permits. What stage had been reached in the implementation of this plan?  
France made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>43. The Netherlands welcomed the introduction of a zero tolerance policy, the 
investigations of human rights abuses and violations and the human rights training provided 
to the police force. , The Netherlands underlined the rate of women&#8217;s death caused by 
gender-based violence, despite the efforts of the Government to promote women&#8217;s rights It 
also raised concerns about maternal death and enquired about existing measures to treat 
post-abortion complications, and guarantees for the non-prosecution of women. The 
Netherlands finally noted the positive response of the State to requests for invitations to 
mandate-holders. The Netherlands made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>44. Mexico recognized the efforts undertaken by the Government in the area of human 
rights. It noted the important legal efforts in the areas of gender equality, improvement of 
the penitentiary system and combating corruption, trafficking and smuggling of persons. 
Mexico welcomed the Government&#8217;s willingness to work with the special procedures of the 
Human Rights Council by responding positively to their requests for visits. Mexico made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>45. The Dominican Republic thanked all delegations for their statements and the 
questions raised, as well as for the recognition of the efforts made by the Dominican 
Republic not only in the preparation of the national report, but also in specific areas. 
Without denying the difficulties and obstacles, the universal periodic review is intended to 
help States address them.  
</p>
<p>46. The delegation reiterated that the Dominican Republic is working towards the aim of 
ratifying CAT and ICRMW.  
</p>
<p>47. On the issue of visits by international human rights mechanisms to the country, the 
Dominican Republic remains open to receiving visits by all international human rights 
mechanisms. The delegation indicated that these visits are extremely beneficial; since these 
can help them focus attention on issues they might have difficulty addressing. 
</p>
<p>48. On the issue of migrant workers, the delegation noted that the Dominican Republic 
is both a sending and a receiving country.  Regarding migrant Haitian workers specifically, 
the delegation wished to put the question in perspective, noting that the Dominican 
Republic and Haiti are the only case of two sovereign States sharing one island. The 
economic trends in the last few decades have led to a situation where the two States have 
the same population, but the Dominican Republic has a larger territory. In addition, 
whereas both are developing countries, the Dominican Republic is already a medium-
income country, while Haiti is a least developed country. The Dominican Republic </p>


<p>economy is six times larger than the Haitian economy. There is a situation where the 
population of the country with a lower level of development has to move towards the 
country where the economic level is better; this is a universal phenomenon. The Dominican 
Republic does not encourage immigration towards its territory. Documented migrant 
workers come voluntarily into the Dominican Republic. In 2008, the Dominican Republic 
issued 76,000 visas to Haitians visitors. This figure is higher than the total number of visas 
issued by the United States of America and the European Union to Haitians citizens in the 
same year. The fact is that when these migrant workers come to the Dominican Republic 
they find themselves in a situation where more than 40 per cent of the people are living 
below the poverty line as defined by the United Nations.  An effort is being made; more 
than 13 per cent of the budget of the Ministry of Health is allocated to the care of Haitian 
nationals residing in the Dominican Republic. In fact, the Dominican Republic is one of the 
countries that provide major assistance to Haiti, in terms of health and education assistance 
to Haitian nationals residing in the country. 
</p>
<p>49. It is also important to highlight that the Dominican Republic has taken measures, 
interpreted by some as being restrictive, concerning the recognition of the rights of the 
Haitian people and the civil registry system. The system in the Dominican Republic has had 
shortcomings in the past, which the Central Electoral Board (CEB) has tried to correct. For 
example, the Dominican Republic has put forward a resolution aimed at detecting 
documents that are falsified. As of 2007, 2,416 false identity documents had been 
identified, of which only 72, or 3 per cent, corresponded to nationals of Haiti. The measures 
taken by CEB are general measures in their nature and do not target any segment of the 
population in particular. 
</p>
<p>50. Switzerland applauded the long consultation process involved in the drafting of the 
report. Switzerland noted with concern that despite the fact that freedom of expression is 
enshrined in the Constitution, there are allegations of intimidation of journalists and human 
rights defenders and these actions are on the rise. With regard to violence against women, 
Switzerland took note of the willingness expressed by national authorities to eradicate this 
phenomenon and to adopt a national plan for equality. However, physical violence against 
women has increased drastically in recent years. Domestic violence has reached point 
where the media speak of it with horror. Switzerland made recommendations.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>51. Venezuela commended the efforts made by the Interagency Commission on Human 
Rights. Venezuela recognized the actions undertaken by the Dominican Republic to ensure 
the right to education, which was given highest priority in the Dominican annual budget. 
Venezuela particularly praised the high enrolment rate in the school system in the 
Dominican Republic. It welcomed the positive prospects of the ten-year plan for all 
educational levels. Venezuela made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. While recalling the rate of population living below the poverty line, Azerbaijan 
commended the national measures taken by the Government to reduce poverty and food 
insecurity, especially the Solidarity Programme. Showing understanding with the huge 
immigration flow the state is facing, Azerbaijan praised the will of the Dominican Republic 
to accede to ICRMW. Azerbaijan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>53. The United States noted the Government&#8217;s nationwide efforts to improve civil 
registration access and procedures. It remained concerned however by the major barriers 
Dominicans of Haitian descent faced in establishing their citizenship. Dominicans who 
lacked citizenship or identity documents faced obstacles in travelling both within and 
outside of country. In addition, persons who were undocumented could not obtain a 
national identification card or a voting card. Those without a national identification card 
had limited access to formal-sector jobs, public higher education, marriage and birth 
registration, formal-economy services such as banks and loans, courts and judicial 
procedures and ownership of land or property. The United States made recommendations. </p>


<p>54. Uruguay emphasized the efforts made by the Dominican Republic in the promotion 
and protection of human rights, including the affirmative actions adopted to ensure 
women&#8217;s participation in public life and the implementation of programmes such as &#8220;Eating 
Comes First&#8221; and the Solidarity Programme. Uruguay recognized that geographic, political 
and socioeconomic factors make the development of a migration policy a complex process 
and indicated that the Dominican Republic should continue strengthening measures aimed 
at protecting the principles of non-discrimination and the right to an identity, among others. 
It enquired about the experiences of the Dominican Republic in its efforts to combat child 
labour.  Uruguay made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. Slovenia commended the State for its efforts to comply with its international 
obligations. Slovenia questioned the State on its concrete plan to eliminate the 
discriminatory provisions present in the Civil Code. It raised concerns about the existing 
prohibition of abortion and wondered if measures were foreseen against the development of 
a black market in illegal abortions. Slovenia asked what was planned to prevent child 
labour and violence against children and to remedy under-resourced education. Slovenia 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>56. Nicaragua highlighted the efforts and progress made by the Dominican Republic in 
modernizing its state, giving it an institutional and normative framework which meets the 
needs of its society. Nicaragua congratulated the Dominican Republic for the process of 
constitutional reform, which was consolidating Dominican democracy. Nicaragua made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>57. Italy commended the growing awareness in terms of the promotion and protection of 
human rights and the adoption of new legislation over the last few years.  Italy formulated 
four recommendations: to include in the school system appropriate measures in the field of 
human rights education; to increase the efforts to combat existing discrimination among 
children; to ratify and implement CAT and to ensure satisfactory prosecution of cases of 
gender-based violence. Italy made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>58. Norway recalled the importance of independent national human rights institutions 
for the awareness and implementation of human rights obligations. Norway raised concerns 
about the vulnerable situation of human rights defenders and journalists working in the 
defence of human rights, including rights of Haitian immigrants and Dominicans of Haitian 
origin. Norway was deeply concerned by the rate of women&#8217;s deaths caused by gender-
based violence. Norway made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59. Germany referred to Human Rights Committee concerns about reports of 
extrajudicial executions of prisoners in State custody and of deaths at the hands of the 
National Police, the armed forces and officers of the National Drug Control Office owing to 
the excessive use of force. Germany was interested to know how the Government had 
addressed these concerns and in particular to learn more about programmes of human rights 
training for the staff of those forces in this regard. Germany made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>60. The Holy See noted the ongoing process of consolidation of democratic institutions, 
including the establishment of local prosecutor&#8217;s offices to safeguard especially the rights 
of women and minors, and the application of a zero tolerance policy in cases of 
mistreatment or violation of the rights of illegal migrants. While appreciating the care of the 
State to protect children, the Holy See remained concerned that many under the age of five 
were without birth certificates. The Holy See drew attention to the trafficking and 
exploitation of persons, especially children, and wondered what measures had been taken to 
confront the problem. The Holy See made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>61. In response to comments made on the situation of women, the delegation of the 
Dominican Republic indicated that it fully shared the concerns conveyed by various 
delegations. In 2000, the Government created a Ministry for Women that is working on the </p>


<p>equity plan. However, they are extremely concerned by the high levels of violence against 
women. As in other areas it must work on education and make efforts to provide for justice. 
The delegation appreciated the suggestions with regard to setting up a database with the 
breakdown of the population.  
</p>
<p>62. The Dominican Republic reiterated its concerns about the violence exercised by law 
enforcement and security forces. The issue should, however, be contextualized. The 
Dominican Republic is facing an increase in crime along with a rising problem of drug 
trafficking. The Dominican Republic is a transit country for drugs going from producing 
countries to the main consumers and markets. This creates many difficulties. Deaths caused 
by law enforcement officers are treated as homicides and the main parties involved are 
subject to judicial actions and prosecuted. The delegation made reference to recent cases in 
this regard.   
</p>
<p>63. Referring to the issue of child labour, the delegation noted that this practice is often 
accepted by certain parts of the population, perhaps because of poverty and the social 
fabric. Action in this regard needs to be taken not only in terms of the legal framework but 
also through education. The last study available, conducted by the International Labour 
Organization in 2000, found that there were about 434,000 working children. Current 
estimates show that number to have decreased to 156,000, mainly as a result of 
programmes such as &#8220;Eating Comes First&#8221; and the Solidarity Programme, but the 
Government is not satisfied yet. It is making efforts within the hemispheric agenda to 
eliminate the worst forms of child labour by 2015 and all child labour by 2020.  
</p>
<p>64. Some delegations made reference to a request to visit the Dominican Republic made 
by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. The 
delegation indicated that the Dominican Republic remained open to visits by United 
Nations human rights mechanisms and had no objections to that visit. A request in that 
regard should be made through the official channels by the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>65. The delegation indicated that the Dominican Republic fully shared the concerns 
expressed concerning issues related to human rights education in various areas, including 
the need to develop a comprehensive human rights education strategy and a culture of 
respect for human rights.  The delegation noted the importance of setting the necessary 
legal framework and conducting efforts to sensitize and provide human rights education to 
the population in order to address particular problems such as racism, xenophobia, violence 
against women, violence against children and the rights of persons with disabilities. The 
Dominican Republic reiterated its serious commitment in that regard and noted that there 
was a need to work hand in hand with all members of society and countries around the 
world.  
</p>
<p>66. Bosnia and Herzegovina noted with satisfaction the ratification of numerous core 
human rights instruments and inquired about the obstacles to ratifying CAT and ICRMW. It 
also asked the delegation about steps being taken to fill the position of Ombudsperson and 
Assistant Ombudsperson for Children and Youth, established by law in 2008. With regard 
to minority issues and certain groups in Dominican society, such as Dominicans of Haitian 
descent and Haitians, affected by the application of the General Law on Migration, it 
enquired about the Government&#8217;s efforts to overcome the consequences of that law for the 
vulnerable groups. Bosnia and Herzegovina made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>67. Bolivia congratulated the Dominican Republic for the high rate of school 
enrollment, as mentioned in the national report. It noted that the Dominican Republic is a 
developing country with limited natural resources, but with the will to address obstacles 
with the support of the international community, as reflected in the allocation of public 
resources, such as in the area of education and health. Bolivia further recognized the </p>


<p>implementation of the national plan to combat smuggling and illegal trafficking of 
migrants. Bolivia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>68. Peru recognized the efforts of the Dominican Republic in favour of women, such as 
electoral law 12.200, which increased to 33 per cent the quota for women in public 
positions, and expressed the hope that the legislative measures would result in the short 
term in a higher representation of women in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. Peru 
asked the delegation to provide more information on the impact of the school subsidy and 
&#8220;Eating Comes First&#8221; programmes. Peru also asked if the Dominican Republic was 
considering extending a permanent invitation to the special procedures mechanisms. Peru 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>69. Jamaica was pleased to note the emphasis of the State on protecting the human 
rights of vulnerable groups. Jamaica congratulated the State for having the second highest 
school enrolment rate in Latin America. Jamaica also recognized the efforts made to 
combat human trafficking and improve victim protection mechanisms and to promote and 
protect civil and political rights, for example by reforming and guaranteeing the 
independence of the judiciary and providing human rights training to law enforcement 
officials.   
</p>
<p>70. The United Arab Emirates noted the progress achieved in the field of women&#8217;s 
rights, especially in achieving equality between men and women before the law. It 
expressed its appreciation for the important initiative to set up a Ministry for Women in 
</p><p>1990. Several practical steps in favour of women has also been adopted, such as the 
adoption of electoral law 12.200 (see para. 68 above) and act No. 13.200, which stressed 
that applications for positions such as commissioners and deputy commissioners, should be 
of alternate sexes. The United Arab Emirates enquired about the outcomes of the national 
plan to encourage equality between man and women and of the equality and development 
offices set up in all government branches to ensure the follow-up of the plan. 
</p>
<p>71. The Maldives congratulated the State for its commitment to human rights, as 
evidenced by its ratification of most core human rights convention. Noting that gender-
based violence remained a problem in the country and often went unreported, the Maldives 
wondered if the State had given consideration to asking the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women for advice on steps to eliminate violence against women. 
</p>
<p>72. Chile congratulated the Dominican Republic for its report highlighting progress 
made in recent years, as well as problems and challenges.. Chile noted with satisfaction the 
important progress made with regard to the human rights of women, children and migrants, 
underscoring the institutionalization of the women&#8217;s and youth affairs ministries, the 
National Plan for Gender Equality, the reduction of the number of children and adolescents 
exposed to the worst forms of child labour and the adoption of laws and action plans to 
combat human trafficking and migrant smuggling. Chile made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>73. Colombia made reference to the progress made for the strengthening of the 
institutional framework for the protection of human rights and asked the delegation to share 
more information on the establishment of the neighbourhood prosecutor&#8217;s offices (<i>fiscal&#237;as 
barriales</i>) and their impact with regard to facilitating access to justice for the most 
vulnerable sectors.  Colombia congratulated the Dominican Republic for its important 
efforts and progress made in the areas of penitentiary reform and public access to health 
services. Colombia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>74. Ecuador<b> </b>highlighted the Dominican Republic&#8217;s efforts and commitment in the 
promotion of all human rights and encouraged it to consider developing and implementing 
a national human rights plan and establishing a national human rights institution in 
accordance with the Paris Principles, as highlighted in the concluding observations of treaty 
bodies.  Ecuador expressed its sincere willingness to support all efforts of the Dominican </p>


<p>Republic in the promotion and protection of human rights and reiterated its readiness for 
cooperating in that regard.  
</p>
<p>75. Latvia noted with satisfaction the domestic culture of the State, which ensured 
respect for fundamental freedoms. It also noted that the Dominican Republic has ratified 
many core international human rights treaties. Latvia referred to the issue of standing 
invitations to special procedures, an issue that it had also addressed as a written question 
prior to session of the Working Group. Latvia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>76. Guatemala welcomed the incorporation of norms for the promotion and protection of 
human rights in the new Constitution to be adopted. . Guatemala asked the Dominican 
Republic to provide more information and share information on its good practices with 
regard to reform and modernization of the penitentiary system. It also asked for information 
on access by undocumented migrants to health services, housing, education, work and 
social security services, as well as on the solidarity pension system. 
</p>
<p>77. Nigeria noted the significant achievements recorded by the State despite the 
numerous challenges it faced and commended the State for being a party to a substantial 
number of the core international human rights instruments and for having cooperated with 
various United Nations human rights mechanisms. Nigeria noted the continuing exclusion 
of persons and a proliferation of racism on the part of some individuals. It questioned the 
State about existing mechanisms to address those practices and the successes recorded in 
their implementation. Nigeria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>78. Haiti referred to the Dominican Republic as a country with which the Republic of 
Haiti shares an island in the Caribbean. These are two countries whose futures are 
inextricably linked. In fact, the Dominican Republic continued to host a major inflow of 
Haitians who had contributed in a substantial way to the growth of the Dominican 
economy. Haiti represents the second destination of products from the Dominican Republic, 
after the United States of America. Haiti took note of the efforts made and the measures 
taken by the Dominican authorities to promote and protect human rights in the country. It 
had above all noted the major difficulties encountered by Haitians in their relations with 
Dominican policemen, army officers and soldiers, and with certain segments of the 
Dominican population, which often gave rise to regrettable incidents linked to the obtaining 
of an identity document and access to basic services. Haiti made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>79. Ghana commended the creative and affirmative actions for women and the opening 
of neighbourhood prosecutor&#8217;s offices for greater access to the justice system. On migration 
issues, Ghana welcomed the act on migrant smuggling and human trafficking and the 
adoption of a zero tolerance policy in cases of mistreatment of illegal migrants by 
inspectors. Noting the condemnation, dismissals and disciplinary sanctions of police 
officers, Ghana asked about the impact of this policy on society in general and on 
foreigners in particular. Ghana also appreciated the openness with which the State had 
discussed its challenges, such as the failure to properly address the issues of discrimination 
and racism. Ghana made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>80. Morocco welcomed the new text of the Constitution, which took on board several 
question relating to human rights, above all the protection of the rights of vulnerable groups 
such as women, children and undocumented migrants. It congratulated the Government of 
the Dominican Republic for the &#8220;Eating Comes First&#8221; programme launched in 2002 to 
alleviate the hunger problem and assist families in situations of extreme poverty.   It 
enquired about other programmes or initiatives which are part of the programme to combat 
poverty, particularly in the area of human development. Morocco congratulated the 
Government of the Dominican Republic for adopting a national education plan for the 
period 2008-2018 and asked whether the plan had a human rights education component to 
it. Morocco made recommendations.  </p>


<p>81. The Dominican Republic thanked all delegations for their questions and comments 
and reiterated its serious commitment to promoting all human rights. It also reaffirmed its 
commitment to ratify and adhere to the conventions mentioned throughout the interactive 
dialogue and its openness to receiving visits by different United Nations human rights 
mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>82. The delegation indicated that there was full freedom of expression in the country and 
that t no one was persecuted for the expression of opinion, nor were any journalists 
imprisoned in the connection.  
</p>
<p>83. Regarding the high number of undocumented persons residing in the country, as 
mentioned by some delegations, the Dominican Republic made reference to experiences 
shared by other countries in that regard. It also recalled that plans for the identification and 
registration of undocumented persons were being developed with the aim of regularizing 
their migratory status. 
</p>
<p>84. Concerning the issue of nationality, the delegation noted that the law did not have 
retroactive effect, and therefore persons who had acquired Dominican nationality cannot 
lose it. It further noted that there was no discrimination in the application of the law, even if 
there might be some isolated instances in that regard. 
</p>
<p>85. The Dominican Republic further reiterated its commitment to addressing specific 
issues in which it had recognized difficulties, such as violence against women, the situation 
of children and child labour. It was also the goal of the Government to address the issue of 
executions as well.  
</p>
<p>86. The delegation thanked Haiti for its statement and indicated that the two countries 
were working together. The delegation appealed to all other countries of the world to 
support the aspiration of Haiti and the Dominican Republic to move forward in the 
community of nations.

</b></p>
<p><b>89. The recommendations below did not enjoy the support of the Dominican 
Republic, and the Dominican Republic offers the following comments: 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Ensure that appropriate legal frameworks are in place in line with the 
international conventions governing the issue of nationality (Canada): The 
Dominican Republic does not accept this recommendation, since nationality is 
already established in the Constitution and is not open to interpretation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>2.  Cancel all retroactive measures taken to replace the principle of jus soli 
with the principle of jus sanguinis for the acquisition of nationality (Spain): The 
Dominican Republic agrees that the law is not retroactive, but cannot accept 
the allegation that the Constitution is applied in a retroactive manner: 
</b></p>
<p><b>3.  Take further steps to tackle impunity, including independent 
investigations of killings by security forces (United Kingdom): The judiciary in 
the Dominican Republic is constitutionally independent and its investigations 
and decisions are impartial and objective; 
</b></p>
<p><b>4. Adopt measures to ensure that Dominican of Haitian descent are not 
denied citizenship or access to civil and birth registration procedures and are 
not arbitrarily subject to retroactive cancellation of birth and identity 
documents (United States): This is not acceptable because, as noted earlier, 
application of the law is not retroactive in the Dominican Republic. In addition 
the Constitution of the Dominican Republic is not subject to interpretation as to 
who is or is not a Dominican; 
</b></p>
<p><b>5. Apply consistent and non-discriminatory citizenship policies and 
practices (Canada). </b></p>


<p><b>90. All conclusions and/or recommendations contained in the present report reflect 
the position of the submitting State(s) and/or the State under review. They should not 
be construed as being endorsed by the Working Group as a whole.
