<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its fifth 
session from 4 to 15 May 2009. The review of Chad was held at the 4th meeting on 5 May 
</p><p>2009. The delegation of Chad was headed by H.E. Abderaman Djasnabaille, Minister in 
charge of Human Rights and promotion of liberties. At its 8th meeting, on 8 May 2009, the 
Working Group adopted the present report on Chad. 
</p>
<p>2. On 8 September 2008, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Chad: France, Slovenia and Zambia. 
</p><p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Chad: 
</p>
<p> (a) A written presentation made in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/5/TCD/1); 
 (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/TCD/2); 
 (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/5/TCD/3). 
</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Argentina, the Czech Republic, Denmark, 
Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Sweden, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Chad through the troika. These questions 
are available on the extranet of the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation states that, since achieving national and international sovereignty on 
11 August 1960, Chad has undergone a period of political instability characterized by 
armed rebellions and intercommunity conflicts which were characterized by and 
encouraged serious human rights violations. It notes that this situation unfortunately led to 
the outbreak of civil war in 1979 and brought to power the Chad National Liberation Front, 
FROLINAT, which installed a transitional Government of national unity. This Government 
set up a court martial, which carried out public executions in order to put an end to the 
crime wave which was sweeping the country at that time. 
</p>
<p>6. The delegation adds that the assumption of power by Hissein Habr&#233; on 7 June 1982 
was marked by serious human rights violations and that, according to the commission of 
inquiry set up following the fall of Hissein Habr&#233;&#8217;s regime, over 40,000 people were killed, 
excluding the victims of collateral damage. So grave were the violations identified by the 
commission that the victims brought national and international legal proceedings, to which 
the Government of Chad lent its full support; their outcome is eagerly awaited. 
</p>
<p>7. The delegation states that, on 1 December 1990, the Patriotic Salvation Movement 
(MPS) came to power, bringing Hissein Habr&#233;&#8217;s dictatorship to an end. This led to the 
installation of a legal, political and institutional framework conducive to the establishment 
of a State based on the rule of law and pluralist democracy, in which fundamental human 
rights and liberties, the dignity of the human person and justice are guaranteed, protected 
and promoted. According to the delegation, the establishment of democracy made it </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/12/5</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> GE.09-16375 
</p>
<p>possible in 1993 to hold a Sovereign National Conference, in which the various political 
and social classes were able to express their views and take important decisions. A Higher 
Council of Transition and a broad national-unity Government were set up, and a National 
Human Rights Commission was established in 1994 to deal with all the violations and 
provide advice and recommendations to the Government on all human rights issues. A 
review of the enactments setting up the Commission is planned in order to bring it into line 
with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>8. The delegation adds that a Constitution was adopted by referendum on 31 March 
</p><p>1996. It guarantees respect for human rights and all the fundamental freedoms embodied in 
international legal instruments. Free and democratic presidential elections took place in 
1996, and free and democratic legislative elections in 1997. The delegation states that other 
national institutions were progressively established thereafter, including the Supreme Court, 
the Constitutional Council, the High Court of Justice, and the High Council for 
Communication and the Office of the Ombudsman. The creation in 2005 of a separate 
ministry responsible for human rights, whose scope was widened in 2008 to include the 
promotion of freedoms, is evidence, if needed, that the President of the Republic, His 
Excellency Mr. Idriss Deby Itno, and the Government are fully determined to give concrete 
expression to the defence and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>9. According to the delegation, the Government&#8217;s efforts, and those of politicians and 
civil society, have been affected by the Darfur crisis, which began in 2003 with a massive 
influx of displaced persons and refugees, intercommunity conflicts and incursions by the 
Janjaweed and armed groups, which eventually led to attacks on N&#8217;Djamena in April 2006 
and February 2008. These various crises once again gave rise to human rights violations, in 
response to which the Government declared a state of emergency to halt the serious 
disruptions of public order resulting from the lack of security in the six regions affected by 
the disturbances and in the city of N&#8217;Djamena. This measure, which was dictated by 
circumstances and in force for a limited period, allowed public and constitutional order to 
be re-established. 
</p>
<p>10. The delegation reports that in order to shed light on the serious human rights 
violations that occurred during these events, the Government set up a commission of 
inquiry, composed primarily of representatives of civil society and international observers. 
The commission has reached its conclusions, which will serve as a basis for initiating a 
judicial investigation to determine responsibility. A technical follow-up committee has been 
set up to monitor the recommendations made by the commission. 
</p>
<p>11. The delegation reports that the importance attached by the Government to public 
health issues led it, in 1999, to adopt a law establishing a system of community 
participation in health costs and, in 2000, a pharmacy law. However, it should be noted that 
the strategies in place far from cover the ever-growing health needs of the population of 
Chad. 
</p>
<p>12. Concerning the right to education, the delegation states that, in accordance with its 
means, the Government does its best to provide teachers&#8217; salaries. However, it notes the 
lack of adequate infrastructure and the fact that teachers are poorly trained (62 per cent lack 
vocational training). Free and compulsory schooling is guaranteed under article 35 of the 
Constitution and secondary education is universal and accessible to everyone throughout 
the country. Technical and vocational education, on the other hand, is not. The delegation 
emphasizes that efforts are being made to make higher education fully accessible for all 
students with a school-leaving certificate and notes the lack of university teaching staff. 
The socio-economic situation of students is currently being re-evaluated in order to find the 
best ways of promoting higher education. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/12/5</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p>GE.09-16375 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>13. The delegation states that, in 2002, a sectoral education policy was adopted as part 
of the drive to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. A project to support reform of 
the Chadian education system was launched. 
</p>
<p>14. Chad is a country in which the illiteracy rate is quite high and efforts are being made 
to provide basic education. Thus, in order to combat illiteracy, a decree was issued by the 
Government in 2000 under which a centre for the elimination of illiteracy in Chad was 
established. Similarly, the Government is keen to ensure that deaf, blind and sick children 
are able to attend school and there are training schools to provide for their education. One 
of the Government&#8217;s policies is to lower the cost of education for girls, social-welfare cases 
and poor children. 
</p>
<p>15. According to the delegation, the right to culture is guaranteed by the Constitution, 
and it is the duty of the State to safeguard and promote the national values of civilization. 
Every citizen has the right to create, to enjoy protection of, and to benefit from his 
intellectual and artistic works. There is a ministry specifically responsible for culture, youth 
and sport which deals with all these matters. 
</p>
<p>16. The delegation notes that, since 1990, Chad has embarked upon a process of 
ensuring women&#8217;s full development. Since ratification of the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child, with the support of partners and in particular UNICEF, a dedicated programme 
has been set up for children. 
</p>
<p>17. The Act of 9 May 2007 was adopted to safeguard the rights of disabled persons. 
</p>
<p>18. The delegation states that freedom of opinion and expression is recognized for all. 
Everyone is free to seek and receive information, since the Constitution provides that the 
freedoms of opinion and expression, communication, conscience, religion, the press, 
association, assembly, movement, demonstration and parades are guaranteed to all. These 
freedoms may only be restricted with due respect for the freedoms and rights of others and 
in response to the need to safeguard public order and morals (art. 27). 
</p><p>19. The delegation mentions that the freedom to form a political party or to belong to the 
political party of one&#8217;s choice is recognized in the national legislation and that more than 
100 legally constituted political parties are active in Chad. In order to encourage this 
democratic form of expression, these political parties each receive a subsidy for their 
operating costs. Similarly, the freedom of all citizens to express their ideas and opinions 
through any means of communication is recognized, as is freedom of the press and printing 
(Press Act, arts. 1 and 2). Chad&#8217;s numerous independent radio stations and newspapers 
contribute to the exercise of these freedoms. 
</p>
<p>20. The Government of Chad has issued a law regulating the press. Freedom of 
expression is recognized by law and exercised by all citizens, and political debates are 
broadcast even on national radio. Private radio stations are governed by a specific law. The 
delegation notes, however, that illiteracy, widespread poverty, the inadequate resources of 
newspapers and private radio stations, and the psychological aftermath of long years of 
political repression constitute undoubted impediments to the full development of these 
public freedoms. 
</p>
<p>21. The delegation states that, since the adoption of various laws relating to freedom of 
association, especially after 1990, there has been a proliferation of various kinds of 
associations and trade unions. 
</p>
<p>22. Finally, the delegation reports that a comprehensive reform aimed at harmonizing 
the enactments governing the judicial system with international standards, in particular the 
Criminal Code, the Codes of Civil and Criminal Procedure and the Family Code, has been 
launched and is in its final stages. The delegation reiterates its willingness to cooperate 
fully with the various United Nations bodies in this area and emphasizes that Chad had </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/12/5</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.09-16375 
</p>
<p>always responded favourably to all the requests to visit it has received and is willing to 
extend an open invitation to mandate holders. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>23. During the interactive dialogue, 49 delegations made statements. A number of 
delegations praised Chad for its comprehensive and frank presentation, for its national 
report and its commitment to the UPR process. They stated that the Constitution adopted in 
1996, the free presidential elections the same year and the 1997 legislative elections, had 
paved the way for the gradual establishment of democratic national institutions. Several 
delegations underlined the need for international assistance and noted Chad&#8217;s accession to a 
number of international instruments, commended significant steps taken in various sectors 
including education and health, and recognized the constraints stemming from the volatile 
political and security situation, the recurrence of cross-border hostilities, the burden of 
protracted refugees and internally displaced persons. 
</p>
<p>24. Brazil commended Chad in particular for promoting a judicial reform and for 
establishing a National Committee for the Elimination of Illiteracy in Chad. Brazil 
recommended to the Government of Chad to: (a) ratify the Convention on the Prevention 
and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide; (b) eradicate possible discriminatory laws from 
its legislation, with a view to guarantee the effective promotion and protection of the rights 
of vulnerable groups, such as women and children; and (c) accomplish progressively the 
human right goals as set up by Human Rights Council resolution 9/12. 
</p>
<p>25. The United Kingdom emphasised the need for free and fair elections, close 
collaboration with MINURCAT and successful implementation of the August accords. It 
raised concerns on impunity and security, as well as the detention of opposition leaders and 
reports of extrajudicial killings. It welcomed positive cooperation on child soldiers and 
called for a national action plan to eradicate this problem. The United Kingdom made four 
recommendations: that Chad (a) take steps to strengthen the criminal justice system and, in 
addition, cooperate fully with the efforts of the United Nations Mission in the Central 
African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT) in this area; (b) accept the request to visit by the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; (c) develop now an 
action plan to prevent the illegal recruitment of children into its forces and establish 
transparent procedures for the verification and release of children in the Chadian army; (d) 
sign and ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. 
</p>
<p>26. Algeria recommended Chad (a) to continue its efforts to ensure education for all 
children and to proceed, with the support and the assistance of the international community, 
to the necessary arrangements for the improvement of its educational system. Algeria asked 
Chad whether an evaluation of needs for technical and financial assistance was carried out 
by the Government, and whether steps have been undertaken to ensure that this kind of 
assistance be provided by United Nations institutions and bodies. While commending the 
Government&#8217;s initiative for the organisation of a forum to evaluate the human rights 
situation in the country, Algeria recommended that (b) solutions to be explored in this 
framework include training and awareness programs on human rights and international 
treaties to the benefit of relevant officers, including United Nations technical assistance 
projects. Algeria recommended the Government (c) to continue in its efforts for the 
reinforcement of the Rule of Law and respect for and the actual implementation of human 
rights throughout the country, in particular through the completion of the existing reform 
process in the fields of justice, territorial administration, the civil registry, the Civil Code 
and the Family Code. 
</p>
<p>27. France called on State authorities to increase efforts to demobilize children enrolled 
in the Chadian armed forces and to take measures to prevent further recruitment, including </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/12/5</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p>GE.09-16375 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>by rebel groups. It also called for strengthening of the rule of law and improvement of 
judicial and prison systems, and requested that illegal detention places be closed. France 
recommended that Chad (a) implement the recommendations of the Commission of 
Enquiry regarding the events of February 2008, (b) end impunity for uniformed personnel, 
(c) ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance, (d) take measures to establish a new legislative framework ensuring 
freedom of the press. 
</p>
<p>28. Saudi Arabia noted that many institutions for human rights were established and that 
the Government combats illiteracy and provides free and compulsory education. It 
recommended that the Working Group report reaffirm the importance for the Government 
to continue its efforts and initiatives to spread education and requested information 
regarding the forum that will be organized on the human rights situation in Chad, in 
particular the right to education. 
</p>
<p>29. The Netherlands referred in particular to the disappearance of opposition leader Ibni 
Omar Saleh after his arrest in February 2008 and looked forward to the outcome of the 
inquiry into the events in Ndjamena in February 2008. The Netherlands recommended 
Chad to (a) bring officials responsible for acts of arbitrary arrest, extrajudicial executions 
and the use of excessive force, torture and rape to justice; (b) ensure due process to all 
detainees; and (c) maintain records for all persons detained by the security forces. The 
Netherlands referred to reports received that women are still victims of certain 
discriminatory practices and, in that regard, recommended that the Government of Chad (d) 
ensure that appropriate penalties are applied for acts such as female genital mutilation, 
forced marriages and sexual violence; (e) ensure that, in practice, girls have equal access to 
education; and (f) amend existing legislation so as to ensure equal succession and 
inheritance rights for women. 
</p>
<p>30. Mali noted the progress made by Chad and recommended that the international 
community provide appropriate assistance, enabling Chad to achieve the objectives 
envisaged in paragraph 89 of its national report. 
</p>
<p>31. Noting that Chad would not be able to face its numerous challenges alone, C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire recommended, especially in the view of a request for technical assistance by the 
United Nations, (a) to reinforce the capacities of the Ministry of Human Rights and of the 
Promotion of Liberty; to energize the National Commission on Human Rights and to 
harmonize national legislation with international human rights instruments. Finally, C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire called on Chad (b) to take concrete and resolved measures to offer immediate 
protection to civilians, and to propose to the armed opposition a viable mechanism for a 
national dialogue conducive to bringing peace and serenity back to the whole country. 
</p>
<p>32. Switzerland recommended that Chad: (a) take all possible measures to ensure 
protection of civilians, in particular vulnerable groups such as children, women and 
displaced persons, (b) increase efforts to reform the judicial system, to allocate the human 
and material resources necessary for the functioning of and independent, impartial and 
effective justice system in order to implement the recommendations by the national 
Commission of Enquiry, established in 2008, (c) reinforce dialogue in the context of the 13 
August 2007 agreements with a view to ensure they are effectively implemented, (d) 
intensify efforts ensuring demobilization of all child soldiers, as well as elaborate a plan of 
action with concrete time period to put an end of the recruitment and employment of child 
soldiers. 
</p>
<p>33. Morocco welcomed the amnesty for persons sentenced to death and disarmament. 
Morocco encouraged Chad to step up its efforts to implement the Commission of Enquiry&#8217;s 
recommendations. Morocco asked about Chad&#8217;s expectations of United Nations 
organizations with regard to strengthening its capacity and implementing institutional </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/12/5</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> GE.09-16375 
</p>
<p>measures for the protection of human rights and the rights of refugees, in particular. 
Morocco recommended that Chad establish a national programme on human rights 
education and training and call for necessary international assistance in this regard. 
</p>
<p>34. Sweden recommended that Chad (a) take further measures to prevent parties to the 
conflict from continuing to recruit children, (b) increase efforts to release and demobilize 
child fighters and implement measures to ensure their reintegration into society. Sweden 
expressed concern on sexual violence against women and girls and recommended that Chad 
(c) implement further measures to tackle the problem of violence against women and 
combat impunity in this regard. It welcomed the law of 2002 prohibiting female genital 
mutilation and recommended to (d) implement further measures to stop female genital 
mutilation altogether. 
</p>
<p>35. Italy recommended that Chad (a) fully implement the 2002 legislation banning 
female genital mutilation and enhance awareness raising campaigns so as to combat this 
practice and other traditions harmful to women&#8217;s health and dignity. Referring to the work 
of the National Commission of Enquiry, which indicated that both rebel groups and 
Chadian National Armed Forces were responsible for human rights violations during the 
events of February 2008, Italy recommended that Chad (b) implement without delay all the 
recommendations formulated by the aforementioned Commission and provide all necessary 
information on the whereabouts of former opposition leader Ibni Omar Saleh. Italy also 
recommended to (c) take all necessary measures to bring to bring to an end the use of child 
soldiers by all parties in armed conflicts in Chad. 
</p>
<p>36. Turkey encouraged authorities to continue cooperation with MINURCAT and with 
humanitarian organizations. It recommended stepping up measures to combat enrolment of 
children by the belligerents, taking into consideration the concerns expressed by the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian 
Affairs. 
</p>
<p>37. Nigeria noted that the armed conflict has brought about human right abuses, 
including sexual violence, recruitment of child soldiers, problems of refugees and internally 
displaced persons, poverty, illiteracy and ignorance, among others. Nigeria called for the 
international community (a) to assist Chad addressing these problems; (b) to help it draw up 
an electoral programme that will be acceptable to all the parties and bring about the 
realization of peace, democracy and good governance; and (c) to provide the urgently 
needed technical and financial assistance in support of its efforts and for the 
implementation of the recommendations that may come out of this review. 
</p>
<p>38. Burkina Faso noted that Chad ratified international and regional instruments on 
children and recommended that Chad continue its policy of implementation of international 
and regional commitments regarding the rights of children. It also invited Chad to continue 
ratifying different international human rights instruments and to implement them. 
</p>
<p>39. The United States of America asked about measures taken to demobilize and 
reintegrate child soldiers and to end their further recruitment by the Chadian National Army 
and by the Justice and Equality Movement rebel group. It recommended that Chad (a) 
demonstrate its firm commitment to ending the unlawful use of child soldiers; (b) formally 
criminalize in domestic law the recruitment and use of child soldiers by non-governmental 
armed groups, if it has not already done so, and enforce such laws if they already are on the 
books; and (c) devote resources to and partner with international organizations in 
prioritizing the reintegration of child soldiers. Secondly, it recommended that the 
Government (d) bring to justice those responsible for abuses that took place between 28 
January and 8 February 2008. Thirdly, it recommended that the Government (e) complete 
its review and repeal the new press law as soon as possible, as it appeared to go against the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/12/5</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p>GE.09-16375 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>Constitution of Chad and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which 
Chad is a party. 
</p>
<p>40. Tunisia commended Chad&#8217;s commitment to human rights which was made clear 
through the establishment of a National Human Rights Commission in 1994. Tunisia 
commended the efforts made in the fields of health and education and took note of the 
determination of the authorities to halt harmful traditional practices which affect the girl 
child. As a recommendation, it encouraged the Chadian authorities to continue their 
activities to combat traditional practices which are harmful to health. 
</p>
<p>41. Denmark recommended that Chad (a) take all necessary steps to implement the 
recommendation of the Committee on the Rights of the Child to prevent, prohibit and 
protect the child from all forms of torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment. As an 
important means to prevent and combat torture, Denmark recommended that Chad (b) give 
ICRC access to all detention facilities, including &#8220;Korotoro&#8221;. It also recommended that 
Chad (c) incorporate in national law the definition of torture as contained in article 1 of the 
Convention against Torture and specifically criminalize torture. 
</p>
<p>42. Mexico asked for further information on programmes for protection of refugees and 
IDPs and sensitization campaigns on child soldiers and child exploitation. It recommended 
that Chad (a) adopt a national action plan for protection of the rights of children and 
adolescents, (b) consider favourably the visits of Human Rights Council&#8217;s Special 
Procedures mandate holders, in particular those who asked to visit the country, and extend 
an open-ended and permanent invitation to the special procedures, (c) readopt the 
moratorium on the death penalty with a view to its total elimination and (d) ratify the 
Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>43. Canada recommended that Chad (a) step up its efforts to curb the recruitment of 
child soldiers by armed groups; and (b) establish a national institution to coordinate the 
reintegration of demobilized child soldiers into Chadian society. Canada recommended (c) 
that those responsible for crimes against women be prosecuted and that the individual and 
family code be promulgated and that Chad provide assistance for women who have been 
victims of sexual violence; (d) that Chad step up its institutional and operational capacity 
with respect to the administration of justice in order to bring a halt to impunity and to 
comply with international human rights instruments. Canada also recommended that Chad 
(e) speedily adopt practical measures for the full implementation of texts governing the 
media so that journalists can fully engage in their profession, and (f) respect the human 
rights of internally displaced persons and refugees. 
</p>
<p>44. Argentina asked for more information on the Commission of Enquiry set up in 2008. 
Argentina stated that Chad should take into account the new guidelines of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees regarding the protection of IDPs and guarantee 
the protection of all refugees, in particular vulnerable groups such as children and women at 
risk. Chad should also give a prompt response to complaints of violations of ICCPR 
regarding refugees and IDPs and international legislation on trafficking in persons. It 
recommended that Chad: (a) conduct campaigns for elimination of discrimination against 
women and (b) consider ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, (c) ratify the International 
Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Forced Disappearance and acknowledge 
the competency of the Committee provided for in the Convention, (d) consider ratification 
of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the International Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, the Second Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol. </p>

<p>45. Malaysia commended Chad&#8217;s cooperation with the Special Procedures of the Human 
Rights Council. Malaysia recommended (a) to undertake more effective measures to 
improve the security of women and girls, in particular those who live in the conflict and 
refugee areas; (b) to increase its cooperation with UNICEF and other United Nations bodies 
to establish a comprehensive strategy to ensure the protection of women and girls from all 
forms of violence, particularly sexual violence; and (c) to continue its effort to stop the 
recruitment and use of children by all parties involved in the conflict in the country and to 
work closely with the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, UNICEF and 
other relevant parties to demobilize children from the military and other armed groups. 
</p>
<p>46. The Democratic Republic of the Congo noted that Chad has made numerous efforts 
to maintain the country on the path of safeguarding democracy and setting up the rule of 
law. Special reference should be made regarding legislation on health, education and the 
fight against corruption. The Democratic Republic of the Congo encouraged Chad to 
continue its efforts to increase citizens&#8217; awareness of the necessity of female education. It 
also recommended Chad to put in place, with the support of UNICEF, permanent structures 
against the exploitation of children as cattle herders. 
</p>
<p>47. Azerbaijan was encouraged by measures taken by the Chadian Government, 
including cooperation with UNICEF, to eradicate children forced labour. Azerbaijan 
recommended Chad (a) to step up its efforts in cooperation with United Nations agencies, 
namely UNICEF, to combat the recruitment of children into military forces and to 
reintegrate children released from the army into normal life; (b) to take all possible 
measures with the assistance of the international community to eradicate illiteracy and to 
ensure access to education especially for girls and women. It asked for further information 
on the state of progress of judiciary reforms and on measures taken, including with 
international assistance, to ensure the right to food, particularly for vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>48. Norway recommended Chad (a) to make it a Government priority to stop impunity

for armed groups, in particular in camps and villages in eastern Chad, criminalize 
recruitment of children under domestic laws and establish a national institution to 
coordinate the release and reintegration of released children, as agreed during the visit of 
the Secretary-General&#8217;s Special Representative in May 2008; and (b) take a systematic 
approach that includes, inter alia, stringent selection processes for and effective supervision 
of conduct of public officials and judges, as well as human rights training. It also strongly 
recommended that the Government (c) take measures to ensure the protection of all women 
from rape and sexual violence, including female genital mutilation. 
</p>
<p>50. Slovenia recommended that Chad (a) take all necessary legislative and policy

camps; (c) take all necessary measures to protect all children in internally displaced persons </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/12/5</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p>GE.09-16375 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>sites and refugee camps; (d) take all measures to address and prevent abduction of children, 
child trafficking, sexual abuse and exploitation and child labour, including the prosecution 
of perpetrators of such acts, and to protect and reintegrate child victims. Slovenia also 
recommended that Chad take all necessary measures (e) to effectively implement the 
national legislation prohibiting female genital mutilation and (f) to protect women, and 
especially girls, from sexual violence in the context of armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>51. Germany cited reports raising the issue of violence against children and asked for 
further information on the juvenile justice system in Chad. Germany recommended that 
Chad (a) abolish the state of emergency; (b) prevent military recruitment of children and 
foster the rights of the child as provided for in the Convention on the Rights of the Child; 
and (c) reform the judiciary and establish a true separation of powers to ensure democracy 
and full respect for human rights. 
</p>
<p>52. Thanking the speakers for the recommendations made which, on the whole, appear 
acceptable, the delegation asserts that the situation in Chad must be placed in context and 
that political will is evidenced by the setting-up of the Ministry for Human Rights and the 
Promotion of Freedoms and by the measures taken by the President of the Republic. 
</p>
<p>53. Chad&#8217;s priority is to safeguard its security and national sovereignty. In this context, 
human rights must also be safeguarded. The Government wishes to act together with the 
United Nations system, in particular the Human Rights Council, to ensure a more secure 
future for children and women. 
</p>
<p>54. The delegation notes that, during a joint mission with the Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the human rights of internally displaced persons, UNICEF and the 
UNHCR, several families housed in UNHCR camps were questioned on the issue of child 
soldiers. In 2003 and 2004, many parents were in contact with rebel groups, but since 2004 
the recruitment of children has stopped completely. A similar situation exists in the camps 
of displaced persons. The Government can state that, within Chad&#8217;s borders, there is no 
child recruitment at present and that the phenomenon of child soldiers which is prohibited 
by law, is no longer a reality. Children&#8217;s place is with their families and at school; the 
Government, which is in the process of bringing its legislation into line with the 
international conventions on the rights of the child, remains vigilant on this issue and stands 
ready to punish any violation. 
</p>
<p>55. Another subject which has been raised is the existence of systematic violence, 
especially sexual violence, against women. The Government has carried out an 
investigation in the east of the country, where the security situation is most difficult, but it 
has not found any firm evidence of such incidents. Since independence, and in particular 
since 1990, several efforts have been made to prevent violence against women and, 
consequently, impunity has been greatly reduced; nevertheless, the Government continues 
to work tirelessly on this question. 
</p>
<p>56. The Government has made specific commitments to bring its laws into line with 
international treaties. In June 2009, a forum in which several foreign States and 
international organizations are due to participate will be organized in Chad; it will carry out 
a comprehensive assessment of the human rights situation in the country and implement a 
substantial number of pertinent measures. 
</p>
<p>57. As far as the agreements of 13 August are concerned, in addition to the setting-up of 
the electoral commission, which has yet to be finalized, the elections will be held with the 
joint agreement of the Government and the opposition, and after the people of Chad, who 
will be free to express their political preferences, have been duly informed. 
</p>
<p>58. Regarding freedom of the press, the delegation notes that, since his appointment in 
2005, the Minister for Human Rights has secured the release of all imprisoned journalists </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/12/5</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> GE.09-16375 
</p>
<p>and human rights defenders. Neither journalists nor human rights defenders may be 
imprisoned for having expressed their opinions. The Government remains vigilant in 
ensuring that there is no violation or abuse in relation to these two categories. 
</p>
<p>59. In its report, the commission of inquiry on the events of 2 February 2008 refers to 
many disappearances. The inter-ministerial commission is in the process of conducting an 
inquiry and any person found responsible will be brought to justice. 
</p><p>60. Finally, concerning the case of Mr. Ibni Omar Saleh, the delegation states that the 
Government has invested considerable human and material resources in the investigation of 
this case, that all leads will be followed up and that justice is taking its course. 
61. Ireland recommended that Chad: (a) develop a plan of action to prevent the 
recruitment of child soldiers and to help with demobilization; (b) make further efforts to 
establish what happened to an opposition leader (Ibni Omar Saleh), ensure that those 
responsible for his disappearance are prosecuted, follow up on the recommendations of the 
fact-finding commission and modify the terms of reference and membership to better 
ensure the independence of the commission; (c) make urgent efforts to ensure humane 
conditions for detainment in prisons; (d) make further efforts to improve the judicial system 
as a step towards ensuring the security of IDPs, one of whose priority concerns is to be able 
to return home. 
</p>
<p>62. Pakistan noted the strong independent role of the National Commission on Human 
Rights, the holding of transparent elections and the progressive establishment of judicial 
and human rights institutions. It recommended that Chad be provided all possible technical 
and financial assistance by the international community and OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>63. Egypt commended Chad&#8217;s tireless efforts and recommended that it (a) further the 
promotion and protection of human rights through the consolidations of its domestic human 
rights institutions with the help of the international community, (b) continue its efforts to 
promote all universally agreed human rights and fundamental freedoms; (c) continue to 
resist attempts to enforce any values or standards beyond the universally agreed ones; (d) 
continue exercising its sovereign right of implementing its penal code in conformity with 
the universally agreed human rights standards, including the application of the death 
penalty. 
</p>
<p>64. The Czech Republic recommended that Chad (a) accede to CAT-OP, establishing its 
national preventive mechanism accordingly; (b) review conditions in all detention and 
prison facilities so that they comply with the Standards Minimum Rules for the Treatment 
of Prisoners; and (c) ensure specific human rights training and education for judicial staff 
and prison officers and ensure their full accountability for any violations. On freedom of 
expression, it recommended that Chad (d) adopt concrete measures to ensure protection of 
journalists and human rights defenders against intimidation, death threats and enforced 
disappearances, and ensure full investigation of any such cases as well as prosecution of 
their perpetrators. With regard to women, it was recommended (e) that legislation 
prohibiting female genital mutilation and violence against women be fully implemented, 
and knowledge of it widely disseminated through awareness-raising campaigns; and (f) that 
Chad present its report to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women without further delay. It also recommended (g) to strengthen measures to ensure 
the strictly humanitarian nature of refugee and IDP camps, to ensure that persons living 
there are protected against violence, in particular gender-based violence, and forced 
recruitment, and finally to increase its efforts to find durable solutions for these persons. 
</p>
<p>65. Spain recommended to Chad to (a) take decisive actions to ensure immediate 
protection for civilians at risk and propose to the armed opposition a viable mechanism to 
meet its needs without the use of weapons; (b) put an end to impunity, investigate crimes 
and bring perpetrators to trial; (c) prescribe female genital mutilation as an offence, in </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/12/5</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p>GE.09-16375 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>addition to its present prohibition by law, and take effective measures to eradicate it; (d) 
declare a new moratorium with a view to ensuring definitive abolition of the death penalty; 
(e) take immediate actions to establish a minimum age of 18 for recruitment and ensure that 
those still fighting are demobilized, and take measures to prevent recruitment of minors in 
refugee camps. 
</p>
<p>66. South Africa was particularly concerned about the high incidence of rape and sexual 
violence of women and girls, including among internally displaced persons. It asked 
questions, inter alia, on measures taken to address gender violence and increase girls&#8217; 
enrolment in schools and on impunity and corruption, particularly within the police and 
military. It encouraged Chad to continue its efforts aimed at, inter alia, the restoration of 
peace and security, the reform of the judicial system and the implementation of the National 
Programme of Action for children. 
</p>
<p>67. The Congo asked for information on the representation of women in State 
institutions. It recommended (a) that Chad ratify pertinent conventions and proceed with the 
harmonization of national legislation; (b) that the international community provide the 
necessary assistance, in accordance with Chad&#8217;s enormous needs. 
</p>
<p>68. Djibouti commended the Government of Chad for its devotion to the principles of 
human rights as defined in the international, regional and subregional instruments. Djibouti 
requested the international community to extend a wide range of support to the Government 
of Chad, helping it to fulfil its commitments. 
</p>
<p>69. Gabon encouraged Chad to promote literacy and strengthen existing legislation in 
view of ensuring free primary and secondary education. It recommended that Chad multiply 
its actions with the view to reinforcing legislation in the domain of human rights. 
</p>
<p>70. Guinea stated that despite the burden of the past and the present geopolitical 
constraints, Chad has been carrying on the long process of the promotion of human rights. 
Therefore, Guinea called upon the Human Rights Council, OHCHR and the international 
community to support and accompany Chad&#8217;s efforts for lasting peace. 
</p>
<p>71. Ghana asked for information on measures aiming to eliminate discriminatory 
practices against women and girls. It recommended that Chad endeavour to adopt readily 
workable measures aimed at improving the capacity of its institutions to fully address the 
sociocultural impediments to the promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>72. China encouraged the Government of Chad to continue the formulation of a national 
programme of action on the protection of children, its judicial reform and the human rights 
education of its citizens, especially military and law enforcement personnel. China 
encouraged Chad to take measures to readjust its domestic law in line with the international 
human rights conventions it has acceded to and to seek international cooperation to improve 
the livelihood of its people. China urged the international community to show full 
understanding of the difficulties encountered by the Chadian Government and provide all

ability to protect human rights. 
</p>

promote human rights and freedoms. 
</p>
<p>76. Bangladesh noted, inter alia, the establishment of the National Human Rights
