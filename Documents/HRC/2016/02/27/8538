<p><b>  Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights on the situation of human rights and the activities of

</p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 13/22, invited the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to report to the Council at its sixteenth session on the 
development of the situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and 
on the activities carried out by her Office in the country. 
</p>
<p> Following the example of the previous report, submitted to the Human Rights 
Council at its thirteenth session in March 2010 (A/HRC/13/64), this report reiterates a 
number of recommendations that the High Commissioner and several human rights 
mechanisms have made in the past. The report assesses the response of the Government of 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo to these recommendations since the last report. In 
the course of the universal periodic review at the thirteenth session of the Council, the 
Government made a commitment to implement several of these recommendations. The 
High Commissioner welcomes this commitment and reiterates that she stands ready to 
assist the Government in its efforts in this direction. 
</p>
<p> While welcoming the Government&#8217;s efforts to implement these recommendations, 
the High Commissioner notes that the human rights situation has not improved since her 
last report and remains a matter of the utmost concern, especially in the east of the country, 
where the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office continues to report serious violations 
of human rights and international humanitarian law by national security forces and armed 
groups. Progress in combating impunity has been weak, and cases of serious obstruction of 
justice continued to be reported during the period under review. No significant progress has 
been made in the structural reforms that are essential to improving the human rights

members during the reporting period. 
</p>
<p> The High Commissioner encourages the Government of the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo to implement all the recommendations contained in this report as soon as 
possible. The United Nations Joint Human Rights Office in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo will continue its efforts to support the Government, including through the plan of 
action that the Government has been invited to implement in accordance with resolution 
13/22. The High Commissioner calls on the international community to assist the 
Congolese Government in addressing the major challenges facing it, and in particular in 
implementing the structural reforms that are essential if there is to be sustainable change for 
the better in the human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

<p><b>I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 13/22, 
entitled &#8220;Situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the 
strengthening of technical cooperation and consultative services&#8221;, adopted by the Council at 
its thirteenth session in March 2010. Following the example of the previous report, 
submitted to the Human Rights Council at that session (A/HRC/13/64), this report takes up 
again a number of recommendations made by myself and by several United Nations human 
rights mechanisms.1 It also assesses the Government&#8217;s follow-up to the recommendations 
since my last report. In the course of the universal periodic review at the thirteenth session 
of the Council, the Government undertook to implement several of these recommendations. 
I welcome this undertaking and reiterate that I stand ready to support its efforts in this 
regard. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Main human rights developments 
</b></p>
<p>2. The key challenges to be met in the area of human rights are as follows: arbitrary 
and illegal arrests and detentions; prison conditions, torture and ill-treatment in detention; 
sexual violence; violations of economic and social rights and exploitation of natural 
resources; the situation of journalists, human rights defenders, victims and witnesses; the 
administration of justice; and ending the impunity of Congolese security forces. These 
challenges reflect the priority areas that are being addressed by my office in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office,2 with a staff of 119 
officers posted in 19 branches throughout the country. This report lists examples of the 
measures taken by the Joint Human Rights Office, often in collaboration with other 
partners, to help the Government to meet its commitments. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 The recommendations referred to are drawn from the following documents: Conclusions and 
</p>
<p>recommendations of the Committee against Torture (CAT/C/DRC/CO/1); Report of the Human 
Rights Division of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
(MONUC) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo on the human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo (January&#8211;June 2007); Report of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
and consequences (A/HRC/7/6/Add.4); Report submitted by the Representative of the Secretary-
General on the human rights of internally displaced persons, Walter K&#228;lin (A/HRC/8/6/Add.3); 
Concluding observations of the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC/C/COD/CO/2); reports of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the situation of human rights and the 
activities of her Office in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (A/HRC/10/58 and A/HRC/13/64); 
and the combined report of seven thematic special procedures on technical assistance to the 
Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and urgent examination of the situation in the 
east of the country (A/HRC/10/59). The High Commissioner also refers in the report to the main 
findings and preliminary recommendations issued following recent visits to the country by the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions in May and October 2009, respectively, the recent concluding 
observations of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (E/C.12/COD/CO/4) and the 
recommendations made under the universal periodic review. In order to avoid repetition, the sources 
of the recommendations will not be cited again in the report, as most of the recommendations have 
been made by several mechanisms, as indicated above.

Democratic Republic of the Congo. </p>


<p>GE.11-10197 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>3. Since my last report, the Joint Human Rights Office has continued to register 
numerous human rights violations throughout the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Most 
of them remain tied to the conflict that still rages in the eastern part of the country. Such 
violations were committed during military operations led by the Forces arm&#233;es de la 
R&#233;publique d&#233;mocratique du Congo (FARDC) against armed groups and/or by armed 
groups in retaliation for those operations. In Orientale province and North and South Kivu, 
the Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army and Forces d&#233;mocratiques de lib&#233;ration du Rwanda (FDLR) 
combatants, in some cases in coalition with other Congolese armed groups, including Mai-
Mai groups, have stepped up attacks on the civilian population, killings, sexual violence, 
looting and abductions. Several of these violent acts could constitute international offences, 
including crimes against humanity and war crimes, as the recent convictions handed down 
by Congolese courts against the perpetrators of similar acts of violence in the eastern part of 
the country show.  
</p>
<p>4. Sexual violence remains a major concern in the conflict taking place in the east, as 
in the rest of the country. The reporting period was particularly marked by the systematic 
rape of at least 380 women, men and children in 13 villages between Mpofi and Kibua in 
Walikale territory, North Kivu, between 30 July and 2 August 2010 by FDLR and Mai-Mai 
Cheka combatants and combatants affiliated with Colonel Emmanuel Nsengiyumva, a 
former FARDC soldier who established his own armed group in early 2010. The security 
forces also committed numerous rapes during the reporting period. For example, 10 women 
were reportedly raped by FARDC soldiers from the 431st Battalion in Katalukulu, South 
Kivu, on 6 August 2010. 
</p>
<p>5. Human rights violations due to structural shortcomings of State institutions 
continued to be reported throughout the country. The situation remains marked by human 
rights violations that are the result of recurring weaknesses of these institutions. Many other 
cases of human rights violations stem from the personal conduct of State officials, who 
often take advantage of their office and use their authority for personal ends with impunity.  
</p>
<p>6. The reporting period has also seen a rise in serious violations of the rights of human 
rights defenders, journalists and opposition party members. The murder during the night of 
1&#8211;2 June 2010 of Mr. Floribert Chebeya, Executive Secretary of the R&#233;seau national des 
ONG des droits de l&#8217;homme de la R&#233;publique d&#233;mocratique du Congo and President of the 
Congolese non-governmental organization Voix des Sans Voix pour les droits de l&#8217;homme, 
attests to the seriousness of the attacks on human rights defenders in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo. These new incidents are particularly troubling as the presidential 
and national legislative elections draw near in 2011. 
</p>
<p>7. On 1 October 2010, my Office issued a report providing an extensive account of the 
most serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed in 
the country between 1993 and 2003. The report notes that the vast majority of the 617 
serious incidents that it describes point to the commission of multiple violations of human 
rights and/or international humanitarian law, which may constitute crimes against humanity 
or war crimes, and often both at the same time. The report also concludes that the 
apparently systematic and widespread attacks on Hutus (refugees and others) in 1997 and 
1998 reveal a number of inculpatory elements which, if proven before a competent court, 
could be characterized as crimes of genocide. There are, however, a number of 
countervailing factors that could lead a court to find that the requisite intent was lacking, 
and hence that the crime of genocide was not committed. The report analyses various 
options for dealing with impunity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including the 
establishment of judicial mechanisms and a truth-seeking mechanism, institutional reform 
and reparations for victims.  </p>

</p>
<p><b> III. Measures and response to recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Arbitrary and illegal arrests and detentions  
</b></p>
<p>8. Several recommendations have been put forward to the Government in the past, 
including on restricting the security services&#8217; powers, giving the police sole responsibility 
for maintaining order, protecting the rights of persons who have been arrested, ensuring that 
the Joint Human Rights Office has free access to places of detention, prosecuting the 
perpetrators of arbitrary detention and providing full compensation to persons detained 
arbitrarily.3 
</p>
<p><b>  Actions taken by the Government and the current situation 
</b></p>
<p>9. Arbitrary and illegal arrests and detentions are still a common practice in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the steps needed to put an end to them are not 
being taken. Arbitrary and illegal arrests and detentions occur so frequently throughout the 
country that many victims consider them to be normal. They are all too often used by police 
officers to extort money from civilians. Members of the national police, FARDC and other 
security forces frequently arrest and detain civilians in an arbitrary and/or illegal manner 
with complete impunity and release them only after they pay a ransom. Victims rarely file a 
complaint with either the perpetrators&#8217; superiors or with the courts.  
</p>
<p>10. The National Intelligence Agency (ANR) continues to detain persons for offences 
under ordinary law that have no connection with the offences under its jurisdiction. During 
the reporting period, persons were detained by the agency in &#8220;security-related cases&#8221; 
without being charged. Public officials continue to deny the Joint Human Rights Office any 
access to detention centres, mainly ANR detention centres and some military camps. 
Unfortunately, despite Security Council resolutions4 and a presidential directive in 2005, 
the Government has not responded positively to the recommendation5 made during the 
universal periodic review aimed at ensuring that the Joint Human Rights Office enjoyed 
free access to detention centres run by ANR or the Republican Guard.  
</p>
<p><b>  Actions taken by the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office 
</b>11. The Joint Human Rights Office increased the number of visits to detention centres 
throughout the country in the reporting period, often in the presence of judicial officials, 
with a view to strengthening observance of international and national standards. Cases of 
illegal and arbitrary detention observed during these visits were referred to the authorities, 
leading to the release of a large number of victims. Further efforts are needed to reduce the 
number of such detentions. 
</p>
<p>12. The Office took a number of steps to raise awareness among the police and other 
authorities about the rules on arrest and detention. For example, between September 2009 
and September 2010, at least 120 human rights training and awareness-raising sessions, 
relating in particular to the rules on arrest and detention, were organized throughout the 
country for members of the security and defence forces. The Office also supported victims 
who wished to file a complaint with the competent authorities, in collaboration with local 
NGOs.

<p>GE.11-10197 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Obstacles to the implementation of existing recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>13. The difficulties highlighted in my previous report (A/HRC/13/64, para. 8) have 
persisted in the period under review. They include a failure on the part of judicial 
authorities and senior security force officials to grasp the seriousness of the arbitrary and/or 
illegal arrests and detentions that can be largely attributed to corruption and structural 
weaknesses of the State.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Prison conditions, torture and ill-treatment in detention 
</b></p>
<p>14. It was previously recommended that the Government should take immediate steps to 
improve detention and safety conditions in all establishments and give effect to the 
provisions of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment in its domestic law. The Government was also invited to take 
effective measures to ensure that all persons reporting torture or ill-treatment are protected 
from threats or intimidation.6 
</p>
<p><b>  Actions taken by the Government and the current situation 
</b></p>
<p>15. I welcome the commitments made by the Democratic Republic of the Congo during 
the universal periodic review,7 including to accede to the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, to introduce a national preventive mechanism and to improve prison 
conditions. On 4 April 2010, the Senate adopted the bill on the criminalization of torture, 
making it a separate offence severely punished by law. Even though this bill and the 
strategic prison reform plan have not yet been adopted by the National Assembly, they are 
encouraging signs nevertheless. 
</p>
<p>16. Despite these advances, I remain concerned at the deplorable detention conditions in 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the prevailing insecurity in places of detention. 
The number of deaths in custody remains high, with about 119 deaths registered between 
January and June 2010. Several physical assaults on detainees, including rapes, were also 
reported during the period under review. With the support of the Joint Human Rights 
Office, the Chief Justice of the Military High Court drew up two directives on 23 June 
2010, on torture8 and death in detention.9 These directives require judges to step up 
monitoring of places of detention with a view to detecting cases of torture and deaths in 
detention, and to submit monthly reports. However, to date, no such reports have been 
submitted. 
</p>
<p>17. Prison escapes have also continued in the past months, often with the use of violence 
and sometimes with the complicity of staff working in the facility. For example, between 9 
and 13 October 2010, 27 detainees, including several soldiers and a former Mai-Mai chief 
sentenced to long prison terms, the death penalty or life imprisonment, escaped from Osio 
prison in Orientale province. Little progress has been made on prison reform, which the 
State had undertaken during the universal periodic review to make a priority through the 
allocation of adequate resources.10

<p><b>8</b> GE.11-10197 
</p>
<p><b>  Actions taken by the Joint Human Rights Office 
</b>18. The strategy adopted by the Joint Human Rights Office to prevent torture and death 
in detention involves monitoring and following up on detention conditions, collecting data 
on human rights violations during detention and defending the rights of persons detained by 
the authorities. Pending the adoption of a law that punishes torture, the Office has entered 
into consultations with judicial officials to develop a legal framework to combat torture.  
19. The Office has also conducted sessions to train and raise awareness among police 
officers about the issue of torture and the rights of detainees. The United Nations 
International Day in Support of Victims of Torture, on 26 June, was an opportunity to 
launch a media campaign on this topic and organize conferences attended by specialists and 
civil society organizations.  
</p>
<p><b>  Obstacles to the implementation of existing recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>20. The difficulties highlighted in my previous report (A/HRC/13/64, para. 15) remain 
topical in that no significant measure has been taken to bring conditions in places of 
detention into line with international standards. The Government should, inter alia, allocate 
a specific budget for prisons and detention centres. Although efforts have been made to 
protect individuals against acts of torture and ill-treatment, they are still not sufficient. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Sexual violence and impunity 
</b></p>
<p>21. Several recommendations were made to the Government in the past, particularly to 
abolish all provisions of Congolese law that discriminated against women, to denounce 
publicly and unequivocally all forms of violence against women, including domestic 
violence, and to ensure that the judicial system brings the perpetrators of such violations to 
justice promptly and impartially. Furthermore, the Government should establish and 
promote an effective mechanism to receive complaints of sexual violence, including in 
custodial facilities, to investigate every complaint and to provide victims with 
psychological and medical care. Finally, the State should pay damages to all victims of 
sexual violence committed by State agents and create a fund for this purpose in the national 
budget.11 
</p>
<p><b>  Actions taken by the Government and the current situation 
</b></p>
<p>22. Sexual violence remains widespread despite the authorities&#8217; efforts to stop it. The 
phenomenon is rampant throughout the country and affects thousands of women and 
children in particular. The recent mass rapes committed in Walikale territory exemplify this 
scourge and are proof that rape continues to be used as a weapon of war in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo.12 
</p>
<p>23. There is no question that the State has become aware that sexual violence poses a 
problem. However, the measures announced, such as tightening the requirements for 
granting bail to persons convicted of sexual violence, have not been adopted formally. To 
the judicial system&#8217;s credit, increasingly severe sentences have been handed down, 
including against members of security forces implicated in cases of sexual violence.13 For 
example, on 30 October, the Uvira military court sentenced five FARDC soldiers accused

<p>of crimes against humanity for the rape of seven women in Mulenge on 8 August 2009 to 
life in prison and ordered them to pay damages.  
</p>
<p>24. The Government renewed its promise to honour the many commitments it made 
during the universal periodic review to combat sexual violence,14 including its commitment 
to implement the 2006 laws and national strategy and allocate more resources to 
prevention, training, the suppression of sexual violence and assistance to victims. I hope 
that these commitments will be translated as soon as possible into practical measures on the 
part of the Government.  
</p>
<p><b>  Actions taken by the Joint Human Rights Office 
</b>25. The Joint Human Rights Office continued its efforts to combat sexual violence 
during the reporting period. It continued to monitor and follow up on cases of sexual 
violence perpetrated in the country and to give its support to the judicial authorities to help 
them prosecute the perpetrators of such acts. For example, between January and October 
2010, the Office supported the judicial authorities by helping them investigate more than 
100 rape cases.  
</p>
<p>26. A project to shore up the campaign against the impunity of perpetrators of sexual 
violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was inaugurated officially on 1 May 
</p><p>2010. The project is funded by the Swedish International Development Cooperation 
Agency and implemented by the Joint Human Rights Office. It covers the provinces of 
Kasa&#239;-Occidental, Kasa&#239;-Oriental, Bas-Congo, Bandundu, Katanga and Kinshasa for a two-
year period. To stop impunity, it seeks to facilitate access by victims of sexual violence to 
the justice system and to train workers in the judicial system and members of civil society. 
27. In the east, the Joint Human Rights Office has continued to implement the judicial 
and legal facets of the &#8220;Fight against Sexual Violence&#8221; project funded by the Canadian 
International Development Agency since 2006. Under this project, 11 legal clinics are now 
running in the Kivus. Other capacity-building activities are organized under this project. 
The Office has also helped to train criminal investigators to follow up on the mass rapes 
and other human rights violations committed by a coalition of rebel groups in Walikale 
territory from 30 July to 2 August 2010. 
</p>
<p>28. In addition to the efforts made by my Office in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, I sent a high-level panel to hear the victims of sexual violence between 30 
September and 10 October 2010. The panel&#8217;s aim was to consider how victims of sexual 
violence and the local people involved perceived the responses provided to victims, and in 
particular to examine the pertinence of the remedies and compensation. To do this, the 
panel travelled to South Kivu, Orientale province and the province of Equateur. The panel 
consisted of Ms. Kyung-wha Kang, Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights and 
chair of the panel, Ms. Elisabeth Rehn, former Minister of Defence of Finland and currently 
Chairperson of the Board of Directors of the Trust Fund for Victims of the International 
Criminal Court, and Dr. Denis Mukwege, director of the Panzi Hospital in Bukavu. The 
panel members held talks with authorities at the national level (the Ministry of Justice and 
Human Rights and the Ministry of Gender, Family and Children&#8217;s Affairs) and local level 
in the provinces visited. The members noted the call from the victims and other parties 
concerned for new measures to give victims more direct and targeted access to 
compensation. Following their visit, panel members will draft a report with

<p><b>10</b> GE.11-10197 
</p>
<p>recommendations, which they will submit to the Government of the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo and other local partners.15 
</p>
<p><b>  Obstacles to the implementation of existing recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>29. Besides the obstacles to the implementation of the recommendations on sexual 
violence listed in my previous report (A/HRC/13/64, para. 23), which have persisted during 
the last reporting period, some Congolese courts do not make full use of the judicial arsenal 
available to them.16 In some cases, the law has been misinterpreted and mitigating 
circumstances misunderstood.17 The situation of women will remain precarious as long as 
the State fails to tackle in earnest the social roots of sexual violence, i.e. women&#8217;s inferior 
social, economic and political status in Congolese society. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Violation of economic and social rights and illegal exploitation of 
natural resources 
</b></p>
<p>30. It was recommended previously that the State party should take sufficient 
comprehensive measures to address the illegal exploitation of natural resources in the 
country, to increase transparency in its revenue collection and to allocate its receipts with a 
view to the progressive realization of human rights, particularly to guarantee free primary 
education to all children, ensure access to affordable basic health care and ensure that 
health centres and hospitals have the necessary human, medical and financial resources.18  
</p>
<p><b>  Actions taken by the Government and the current situation 
</b></p>
<p>31. The submission by the Democratic Republic of the Congo of its combined second to 
fourth periodic reports to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
following a 21-year delay was a positive development. The Committee considers that 
impunity for human rights violations and the illegal exploitation of the country&#8217;s natural 
resources, including by foreign companies, constitute major obstacles to the enjoyment of 
economic, social and cultural rights. In its concluding observations adopted in November 
2009 (E/C.12/COD/CO/4), the Committee requested the State party to take immediate 
steps, including legislative measures, to create and ensure effective domestic remedies for 
all economic, social and cultural rights. In this respect, I commend the commitment made 
by the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the universal periodic review to ratify the 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.19 
</p>
<p>32. The standard of living of the Congolese people hardly corresponds to the country&#8217;s 
natural wealth, as is shown, inter alia, by the human development index, which measures 
the average level of human development in a given country from three key angles: health 
and life expectancy, access to education and a decent standard of living. The United 
Nations Development Programme has reported a decrease in this indicator for the country

 This has also been assessed in the report of the mapping exercise documenting the most serious 
</p>
<p>violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed within the territory of the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo between March 1993 and June 2003 (sect. III, paras. 799&#8211;840 and

<p>in the past two years, which now puts the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 168th place 
in a list of 169 countries.20 
</p>
<p>33. This situation is explained by inadequacies in the management of revenue from 
natural wealth, bad governance and the illegal exploitation of natural resources. Such 
exploitation remains a matter of concern in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in that it 
leads to serious human rights violations by security forces and armed groups alike. In the 
provinces of Maniema, North Kivu and South Kivu, mining operations were suspended on 
20 September 2010 by ministerial order.21 This decision was justified by the &#8220;interference 
of foreign agents and persons in the mineral exploitation and marketing services recognized 
by the Mining Code&#8221;. The implementation of this decision also causes many problems. 
</p>
<p>34. The policies set up by the Congolese State are not liable to contribute effectively to 
fulfilling the commitments that it has entered into under the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and its commitment to combating poverty. Not 
enough budgetary resources have been allocated to ensuring that universal access to 
education, health and drinking water is gradually achieved. The share of the budget 
allocated to investment in social infrastructure is very low compared to other sectors such 
as defence and institutional overheads. Moreover, it has been steadily declining for several 
years.  
</p>
<p><b>  Actions taken by the Joint Human Rights Office 
</b>35. The Joint Human Rights Office has continued to monitor and follow up on 
violations of economic and social rights and human right violations relating to the illegal 
exploitation of natural resources.22 It has also taken measures to build the capacity of 
government and non-governmental players in this area. For example, the Office organized a 
round table for the network of deputies for the protection and promotion of human rights on 
25 and 26 October 2010, which took up, among other things, the issue of economic, social 
and cultural rights and the illegal exploitation of natural resources. 
</p>
<p>36. In collaboration with the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, the 
Office organized an expert workshop on the illegal exploitation of natural resources and 
economic, social and cultural rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 17 and 18 
August 2010. The workshop enabled the experts who met in Kinshasa to assess national 
policies and put forward recommendations to the various players concerned. During the 
Conference, emphasis was put on the link between the illegal exploitation of natural 
resources and the armed conflict in the east of the country. It was recommended that the 
Government should step up its campaign against impunity, accede to various certification 
and traceability protocols and take human rights into consideration in the exploitation of 
natural resources.  
</p>
<p><b>  Obstacles to the implementation of existing recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>37. The difficulties highlighted in my previous report (A/HRC/13/64, para. 29) are still 
valid. The Government has yet to set up a system that would allow for the certification of

</p>
<p>22
 See para. 22. The report of the fact-finding mission into mass rapes in Walikale shows this 
</p>
<p>connection. &#8220;Under the false pretext of advancing political and social claims these armed groups have 
taken control of several communities in Walikale territory, province of North Kivu. Walikale territory 
is a mineral-rich area and armed groups are able to finance their movements through control of

<p>origin and ensure the traceability of minerals so as to update its monitoring systems and 
increase its share of revenue from mining. Tax collection also remains inadequate. State 
officials do not have the means to cover the entire territory and their low salaries make 
them susceptible to corruption. The Government is also confronted by a lack of security in 
the provinces of the east, where most of the exploitation of natural resources is 
concentrated. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Situation of journalists, human rights defenders, victims and witnesses 
</b>38. A number of recommendations have been made in the past, including that State 
institutions should encourage the democratic process and that the State should respect its 
international obligations related to freedom of expression and freedom of the press. During 
her visit in May 2009, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders 
also recommended that the Government should adopt laws on the protection of human 
rights defenders, respect the regime of notification governing the right to peaceful assembly 
and grant legal personality to NGOs that met the administrative requirements.23 
</p>
<p><b>  Actions taken by the Government and the current situation 
</b></p>
<p>39. In my last report on this subject, I drew a very bleak picture of the situation of 
journalists, human rights defenders, victims and witnesses. The situation has barely 
improved in the period under review. In fact it is getting worse. The most telling recent case 
was the murder of Mr. Floribert Chebeya Bahizire.24 On 2 June 2010, a day after he had 
been summoned to the office of the Inspector-General of Police in Kinshasa, his body was 
found in his car. The chauffeur who was with him is still missing. The trial in the case 
opened on 12 November 2010 at the Gombe military court in Kinshasa. Of the eight police 
officers charged with murder, kidnapping, misappropriation of munitions, conspiracy and 
terrorism, five &#8212; all of whom were being held in Makala prison in Kinshasa &#8212; appeared 
before the court. The other three are still on the run and will be tried in absentia. The 
hearings resume on 3 December 2010, giving the defendants time to prepare their defence. 
</p>
<p>40. During the universal periodic review,25 the Government of the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo undertook to adopt an effective legal framework for the protection of human 
rights activists in line with the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders (General Assembly 
resolution 53/144). Despite this undertaking, however, at the time of writing no bill or 
proposal for a national law has been put forward, and cases of violence, harassment and 
threats against human rights defenders continue to be observed. My Office is ready to 
provide the Government with all the technical assistance it needs to implement a suitable 
legal framework. 
</p>
<p>41. Journalists&#8217; working conditions have deteriorated in the last few months and could 
get even worse as the presidential and parliamentary elections draw near in 2011. 
Journalists covering supposedly sensitive events or issues such as the exploitation of natural 
resources or public procurement are at greatest risk of threats, intimidation and other 
violations of their rights. 
</p>
<p>42. Within the framework of the universal periodic review,26 the Congolese Government 
pledged to take further steps to create an environment conducive to the freedom and 
independence of the media. Some progress has been made. In the period under review, new

<p>operating licences were granted to the media, and on 12 October 2010 Radio France 
Internationale was allowed to broadcast throughout Congolese territory again after a year&#8217;s 
suspension. However, developments like this &#8212; encouraging though they may be &#8212; are 
pointless if the press is not absolutely free and independent in its work.  
</p>
<p>43. The protection of victims and witnesses, especially those who dare to file a 
complaint or testify in cases involving State officials or powerful individuals, is also weak. 
I am concerned about the reports of threats against the dozens of women raped in Walikale 
who agreed to cooperate with the military courts,27 and call on the authorities to provide, 
with the help of the international community, protection for all victims and witnesses in the 
investigations. 
</p>
<p><b>  Actions taken by the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office 
</b>44.  The Joint Human Rights Office has closely followed the cases of journalists, human 
rights defenders and the victims and witnesses of rights violations. For example, between 
January and September 2010, it dealt with over 120 cases of protection from all over the 
country. Some individuals received assistance under the protection programme for victims 
and witnesses of human rights violations, while some journalists and human rights 
defenders who had received threats in the course of their work received assistance financed 
by the fund managed by the Joint Human Rights Office and Avocats sans fronti&#232;res. With 
help from NGOs, a protection network takes protective measures, defends the people 
concerned, publicly reports threats, alerts the authorities, gives practical advice on 
protection and relocates victims inside the country.  
</p>
<p>45. The Joint Human Rights Office has continued to train NGOs and journalists in the 
field of human rights and individual protection. Awareness-raising activities for officials 
have also been carried out, to draw the authorities&#8217; attention to the intimidation of victims, 
witnesses, journalists and human rights defenders, and to highlight the need to protect them. 
</p>
<p><b>  Obstacles to the implementation of existing recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>46. The obstacles to improving the situation are the same as those mentioned in my 
previous report (A/HRC/13/64, para. 36). Human rights defenders, journalists, victims and 
witnesses whose rights have been violated often do not wish to file a complaint for fear of 
reprisals, which encourages further violations. They will remain vulnerable until a law 
specifically aimed at their protection is adopted and followed up with practical measures. 
As the presidential and parliamentary elections draw near in 2011, it is vital that the role of 
the media and human rights defenders, and their contribution to the democratic process in 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is understood and respected by all parties, from 
government and opposition alike. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Administration of justice and impunity  
</b>47. It was previously recommended that the Democratic Republic of the Congo should 
strengthen its judicial system and law enforcement and that Parliament should bring 
legislation into line with international standards, giving priority to the adoption of 
fundamental laws to reform the judicial system. It was also recommended that the 
Government should ensure that the military courts restrict themselves to trying members of 
the military for military offences, in accordance with the applicable international norms.28

<p><b>14</b> GE.11-10197 
</p>
<p><b>  Actions taken by the Government and the current situation 
</b></p>
<p>48. Some progress can be observed in the administration of justice, including efforts to 
strengthen the judicial system. Pursuant to a Presidential Order of 30 July 2010, 984 judges 
were appointed as deputy public prosecutors, and on 31 July 2010 the Minister of Justice 
and Human Rights announced the creation of 85 magistrates&#8217; courts. One thousand new 
judges are being trained and should be in post in 2011. It should be stressed that by the end 
of the present and forthcoming recruitment drive, 400 women will have been recruited, 
raising the proportion of women in the judiciary from 5 per cent to 25 per cent. Of these 
women, 100 will be trained in issues related to sexual violence and will be assigned to work 
in the east of the country. I welcome this initiative and can only encourage the Government 
to do more in this direction. 
</p>
<p>49. Judges will only be able to do their job effectively if they have adequate resources. 
This means, among other things, allocating a reasonable budget to the judicial system to 
bring it up to international standards, modernizing infrastructure and recruiting sufficient 
judicial officials. Judges assigned to work in the provinces face non-payment of their post 
allowance and the absence of an office or accommodation on arrival at their place of work. 
Given that the training course for new judges is so short, it would be a good idea to set up a 
mechanism to monitor and evaluate their skills in order to improve their performance and, 
more generally, the administration of justice. 
</p><p>50. The political and administrative authorities, as well as the security forces, continue 
to interfere in judicial procedures, not to mention that investigations rarely lead to a proper 
prosecution or conviction. Interference occurs at every step of the proceedings, as 
evidenced by refusals to open an inquiry, to bring military personnel suspected of human 
rights violations to justice or to release people who have been arrested. Judges often receive 
threats when they try to open a criminal investigation. To give one example, on 12 August 
2010, a group of FARDC soldiers who had formerly been members of the Congr&#232;s national 
pour la d&#233;fense du peuple (CNDP) surrounded the judge advocate&#8217;s office in Goma and 
obtained the release of a major of the 212th Brigade stationed in Walikale who had been 
arrested earlier in the day. 
</p>
<p>51. The obstacles described above undermine efforts to combat impunity. A classic case 
of impunity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo concerns General Bosco Ntaganda. 
Although the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for him and the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo is cooperating with the Court, Mr. Ntaganda is not only 
still at large but also continues to play an important role in the armed forces. Moreover, 
during the universal periodic review the Government did not accept the recommendations 
that it should uphold its treaty obligations by arresting Mr. Ntaganda and transferring him 
to the International Criminal Court in The Hague.29 
</p>
<p>52. During the universal periodic review, the Congolese Government reiterated its 
commitment to incorporate the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court into 
domestic legislation as soon as possible.30 It also undertook to accelerate the process of 
establishing the national commission for the promotion and protection of human rights, in 
accordance with the Paris Principles.31 Reforms that would give effect to these 
commitments have not yet been implemented. A bill on the establishment of a national 
human rights commission has been before Parliament since June 2008. As regards the 
incorporation of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court into domestic 
legislation, the submission on 4 November 2010 of a bill on the subject to the political,

<p>administrative and legal committee is a step towards the adoption of a proposal that has 
been before Parliament since 2003. It is to be hoped that it will be adopted within a 
reasonable time frame, as it would give the Congolese judicial system more weapons in the 
fight against impunity. 
</p>
<p>53. As regards the establishment of the human rights liaison body recommended by the 
Human Rights Council,32 this body is not yet working effectively. It was established by 
order of the Prime Minister on 12 August 200933 and officially inaugurated on 17 April 
2010, and held its first expert meeting on 24 August 2010. Nevertheless, the Government 
will have to demonstrate real commitment if this mechanism is to function effectively.  
</p>
<p><b>  Actions taken by the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office 
</b>54. The Joint Human Rights Office has stepped up its assistance to the judicial system in 
several areas, in cooperation with the Rule of Law Section of the United Nations 
Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
(MONUSCO), the United Nations Development Programme and other partners. The 
judicial authorities continued to receive assistance with the conduct of inquiries. Between 
January and October 2010, the Office helped the authorities to conduct 28 inquiries into 
human rights violations in Goma, Beni, Butembo, Bukavu, Uvira, Bunia, Kisangani, Kindu, 
Dungu, Kananga and Mbandaka. It also stayed in regular contact with the authorities for the 
duration of the follow-up to the cases, and trained a number of judicial officials in human 
rights principles and the rule of law. In an effort to make the judicial system more effective 
and accountable, the Office also helped develop a code of ethics for judges. 
55. In addition to my Office&#8217;s work in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, I 
implemented a &#8220;mapping exercise&#8221;, which resulted in the publication of the &#8220;Report of the 
mapping exercise documenting the most serious violations of human rights and 
international humanitarian law committed within the territory of the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo between March 1993 and June 2003&#8221;.34 The report contains descriptions of 
over 600 incidents that took place in the country during that period, as well as numerous 
serious acts of violence committed by foreign and Congolese forces or armed groups. The 
vast majority of the incidents concern multiple violations of human rights or humanitarian 
law, and could constitute crimes against humanity or war crimes, and often both at the same 
time. The report also concludes that the apparently systematic and widespread attacks on 
the Hutu (refugees and others) in 1997 and 1998 reveal a number of inculpatory elements 
which, if proven before a competent court, could be characterized as crimes of genocide. 
There are, however, a number of countervailing factors that could lead a court to find that 
the requisite intent was lacking, and hence that the crime of genocide was not committed. 
</p>
<p>56. One important aspect of the terms of reference for the mapping exercise was the 
assessment of the resources available to the Congolese justice system to deal with the 
numerous crimes committed between 1993 and 2003, as well as afterwards. The report 
concludes that the capacity of the Congolese justice system to bring an end to impunity for 
crimes under international law is severely limited. It goes on to list the options for 
combating impunity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including the establishment 
of judicial mechanisms and a truth-seeking mechanism, institutional reform and reparations 
for victims.

<p>57. As noted in the report, it is essential that the authorities carry out prior national 
consultations to ensure that the Congolese people are fully involved in assessing needs, 
establishing priorities and finding solutions &#8211; in short, to ensure that they assume ownership 
of these new mechanisms and understand their function and scope. I welcome the 
cooperation of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in this respect, 
and invite the international community to support efforts to strengthen the justice system 
and to implement a strategy that will guarantee transitional justice. 
</p>
<p><b>  Obstacles to the implementation of existing recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>58. The obstacles identified in my previous report are still valid (A/HRC/13/64, para. 
42). The administration of justice in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to be 
severely hampered by inadequate resources. The living and working conditions of judges 
are such as to discourage respect for the principle that judicial cases should be dealt with in 
a reasonable time. This lack of resources also hampers the fight against impunity, as it 
leaves judges and judicial officials more open to corruption. Courts that do not receive 
sufficient funding to cover their operating costs tend to finance themselves by charging 
exorbitant fees. This situation calls into question the impartiality and independence of the 
courts and makes them seem distant from the people. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Fight against impunity for the Congolese security forces 
</b></p>
<p>59. A number of recommendations have been put to the Congolese Government in the 
past, including that it should firmly implement a zero tolerance policy for all human rights 
violations and that it should carry out thorough background checks on candidates for 
official posts to ascertain their record on respect for international humanitarian law and 
human rights, especially when they are applying for key posts in the armed forces, national 
police or other security services. It has also been recommended that the Government should 
take appropriate action to remove army officers or units involved in serious human rights 
violations and to bring those concerned to justice.35 
</p>
<p><b>  Actions taken by the Government and the current situation 
</b></p>
<p>60. Much more needs to be done to put the President&#8217;s policy of zero tolerance into 
practice.36 As far as the judicial system is concerned, the duty to systematically investigate 
all human rights violations and to effectively prosecute and punish the perpetrators must be 
acted upon. In recent months, proceedings against law enforcement officers have resulted in 
convictions and the payment of compensation to victims. In general, however, many 
officers have evaded justice, victims are rarely compensated and the sentences handed 
down are not actually served by the offenders. 
</p>
<p>61. In May 2009, a list of five army officers involved in serious human rights violations, 
including sexual violence, was handed to the President by a Security Council delegation on 
a visit to Kinshasa. Three of the five are now in pretrial detention in Makala central prison 
in Kinshasa and requests for judicial assistance have been sent by the chief military 
prosecutor to the relevant judge advocates asking for investigations to be carried out. The 
fourth officer on the list was located in the province of Equateur, where he is in charge of a 
battalion. On 14 June 2010, the FARDC chief of staff sent a letter to the commander of the

<p>third military region asking for this officer to be handed over to the judge advocate. So far 
no action has been taken on this request. The fifth officer is still on the run. 
</p>
<p>62. Within the framework of Operation Amani Leo, which succeeded Operation Kimia 
II in January 2010, the Joint Human Rights Office continued to collect information on 
human rights violations committed by soldiers from battalions not supported by 
MONUSCO as well as from battalions supported by MONUSCO under its &#8220;conditionality 
policy&#8221;.37 The Joint Human Rights Office has observed, on the basis of documented cases, a 
fall in the number of human rights violations committed by soldiers from battalions 
supported by MONUSCO.38 This is partly down to the screening of battalion commanders 
and their deputies, carried out with the help of the Joint Human Rights Office.  
</p>
<p>63. Screening is also carried out in other operations, such as Rudia II (in Orientale 
province), Western Thrust (in Equateur province) and Iron Stone (in Ituri). The 
conditionality policy is applied to all operations supported by MONUSCO. My Office took 
part in the inter-agency mission to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in May 2010 to 
assess the implementation of the conditionality policy. The mission concluded that 
MONUSCO had made a real effort to integrate the policy into its general protection work, 
but that serious problems persisted. Several recommendations were made in this respect. 
</p>
<p>64. The Joint Human Rights Office continued to collect evidence of human rights 
violations by soldiers in unilateral operations conducted by FARDC.39 For example, the 
Office received allegations that between 18 and 22 September 2010 FARDC soldiers from 
Pinga (115 km north-west of Masisi) had pillaged many villages between Pinga and Kibua, 
in Walikale territory, North Kivu, while on their way to operational zones.  
</p>
<p>65. The Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo invited the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions to visit the country in October 
</p><p>2009. Following his visit, the Special Rapporteur made six recommendations for combating 
the prevailing impunity in the country. Noting in particular that FARDC members enjoyed 
impunity thanks to their anonymity, he suggested that they should be required to display 
their name on a uniform identifying their military unit. This measure would make it easier 
to identify and investigate members of the security forces responsible for serious human 
rights violations. 
</p>
<p>66. The cases mentioned above demonstrate how urgent it is to take action in the longer 
term to introduce some mechanism for vetting members of the security forces, so as to rid 
these forces of anyone responsible for serious human rights violations.40 As FARDC

<p>37
 Under the conditionality policy, the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic 
</p>
<p>of the Congo (MONUC) does not take part in or support the operations of FARDC units if there are 
substantial reasons for believing that the units might violate international humanitarian law, 
international human rights law or international law on refugees in the course of the operation. For 
more details on the implementation of this policy, see the reports of the Secretary-General on the 
United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (S/2009/623, 
S/2010/164 and S/2010/512).

 The Security Council has asked the Congolese authorities on several occasions to set up, with 
</p>
<p>MONUC assistance, an effective vetting mechanism, in accordance with international standards, for 
the FARDC and the national security forces, to ensure the exclusion of those persons associated with 
violations of international humanitarian law and human rights abuses (Security Council resolution 
1906 (2009), para. 32). In its resolution 1925 (2010), establishing MONUSCO, the Security Council 
&#8220;emphasizes that the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo bears primary 
responsibility for security, peacebuilding and development in the country, and encourages the

</p>
<p>continues to be responsible for a significant number of human rights violations in the 
country, such a measure is essential to guarantee a sustainable peace and stability. I 
understand the difficulties the Government faces in this respect and welcome its 
commitment during the universal periodic review to set up such a mechanism.41 I invite the 
members of the international community involved in the security reform to support the 
Congolese Government in its efforts to integrate human rights principles in this reform. 
</p>
<p><b>  Actions taken by the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office 
</b>67. The Joint Human Rights Office pays particular attention to allegations of human 
rights abuses by Congolese security forces. An investigation is launched and followed up 
with the Congolese authorities whenever there is reason to believe that a member of the 
security forces has been involved in a violation of human rights. 
</p>
<p>68. As regards Operation Amani Leo, the Joint Human Rights Office continues to vet 
officers to exclude from operations anyone against whom there is evidence of involvement 
in serious human rights violations.  
</p>
<p>69. Funding has been raised from the Government of the United States of America to 
pay for 10 internationally recruited human rights experts to bolster the joint protection 
teams deployed in the east of the country. These teams were established by MONUSCO at 
the end of 2008 to improve the protection and information mechanisms that liaise between 
the force and local communities. 
</p>
<p><b>  Obstacles to the implementation of existing recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>70. The shortcomings identified in my previous report (A/HRC/13/64, para. 48) persist. 
Policies of zero tolerance for human rights violations committed by the security forces and 
forces receiving conditional support continue to come up against protective military 
superiors and ill-disciplined troops. In the absence of background checks on anyone 
wanting to join FARDC and measures to modernize the payment of soldiers&#8217; wages and 
enforce discipline, initiatives by the Government and its partners to prevent human rights 
violations are bound to end in failure. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>71.<b> Since the publication of my previous report, and despite the efforts of the 
Congolese Government and support of the international community, little observable 
progress has been made in implementing the recommendations addressed to the 
Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo by United Nations human 
rights mechanisms, including the special procedures and human rights treaty bodies. 
There are still, it must be said, numerous obstacles to their implementation which 
preclude any significant improvement in the human rights situation. 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Recommendation to the Government of the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo and the international community 
</b></p>
<p>72.<b> I welcome the fact that the Government of the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo has taken on board some of the recommendations addressed to it by 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to remain fully committed to protecting the 
population through the establishment of professional and sustainable security forces&#8221; (para. 5).

<p><b>international human rights mechanisms &#8212; including those reiterated in this report &#8212; 
and voluntarily accepted by it during the universal periodic review. I hope that this 
commitment will be reflected, in the short term, in practical steps to alleviate the 
suffering of so many Congolese people and, in the long term, in practical solutions to 
overcome the obstacles identified in this report. I reiterate my support and the 
support of the Joint Human Rights Office for the Government, including to help it 
implement the plan of action called for by the Human Rights Council. I call on the 
international community to back the Government&#8217;s efforts and the work of the United 
Nations Joint Human Rights Office in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendation to the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>73.<b> The Human Rights Council should continue to be seized of the human rights 
situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to ensure that the situation is 
continuously monitored, including by calling on the Government to interact more 
closely with the various human rights mechanisms and to keep it regularly apprised of 
progress in formulating and implementing its plan of action. I stand ready to submit a 
report on the situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to 
the Council at its nineteenth session.
