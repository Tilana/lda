<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 21/27 
in which the Council renewed the mandate of the Independent Expert on the situation of 
human rights in the Sudan and requested him to continue his engagement with the 
Government of the Sudan with a view to implementing the projects that would further help 
the Sudan to fulfil its human rights obligations, and to report to the Council at its twenty-
fourth session. The Council also urged the Government of the Sudan to grant the 
Independent Expert access to the entire country, in particular Darfur, South Kordofan and 
Blue Nile, in order to verify and assess the human rights situation therein and to determine 
technical assistance needs. 
</p>
<p>2. This report covers the period from October 2012 to July 2013 and contains 
recommendations addressed to the Government of the Sudan, the international community, 
civil society organizations and the armed movements in the Sudan. 
</p>
<p>3. In compliance with the code of conduct for special procedures mandate holders of 
the Human Rights Council, a draft of the report was shared with the Government of the 
Sudan to provide it with the opportunity to comment on the findings and observations of 
the Independent Expert.  
</p>
<p>4. The Independent Expert would like to thank the Government of the Sudan for its 
continued cooperation and support in the implementation of his mandate. During the 
reporting period, the Government granted access and facilitated the Independent Expert&#8217;s 
visit to Darfur, North Kordofan and Blue Nile. The Government also facilitated access to 
all officials with whom the Independent Expert had expressed the wish to meet, and to all 
institutions and places necessary for the discharge of his mandate. However, for security 
reasons, the Independent Expert was unable to visit South Kordofan state. 
</p>
<p>5. The Independent Expert also expresses his gratitude to the African Union-United 
Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID), United Nations agencies operating in the 
Sudan, members of the diplomatic community, civil society organizations and all other 
groups and individuals who provided assistance, information and shared experiences with 
him.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Methodology and approach 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Independent Expert undertook two missions to the Sudan during the reporting 
period and visited Khartoum, North and South Darfur, North Kordofan and Blue Nile 
states. During these visits, he focused on assessing the effectiveness of institutions 
responsible for promoting and protecting human rights and the rule of law, including the 
National Commission for Human Rights, the National Legislature, the judiciary, law 
enforcement agencies and civil society organizations, in order to determine their technical 
assistance needs in the field of human rights.  
</p>
<p>7. In Khartoum, the Independent Expert held wide-ranging discussions with senior 
Government officials, including the Minister of Justice, the Minister of the Interior and the 
Undersecretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was apprised of the human rights 
situation in the country by the Rapporteur and members of the Advisory Council for 
Human Rights (ACHR) and was encouraged by their response to some of the issues he 
raised. He also had frank and fruitful discussions with the Director of the National Security 
Service (NSS) and the Deputy Director General of Police. He interacted with the Chief 
Justice and members of the Supreme Court, the Chairwoman and members of the National 
Commission for Human Rights, members of the National Press Council and the Unit for </p>


<p>Combating Violence against Women and Children. The Independent Expert also met with 
civil society organizations, human rights defenders and victims of human rights violations, 
some of whom shared their personal experiences with him. He met with members of the 
diplomatic community, representatives of opposition political parties and some staff 
members and students of the University of Khartoum, and received valuable information on 
the human rights situation in the country. 
</p>
<p>8. In Darfur, the Independent Expert met with the Governors of North and South 
Darfur, the Head of the Security Commission of the Darfur Regional Authority (DRA), the 
Head of the North Darfur judiciary, the Special Prosecutor for Darfur crimes, the North 
Darfur General Prosecutor, the State Minister for Social Affairs, the Family and Child 
Protection Unit of the Sudanese police, officials of UNAMID and United Nations agencies 
in North and South Darfur. He also had fruitful meetings with human rights defenders and 
representatives of civil society organizations in the two states, and visited two camps for 
internally displaced persons, namely, Abou Shouk IDP camp in North Darfur and Otash 
camp in South Darfur, where he witnessed the deplorable living conditions of the residents. 
He also visited the Centre for Peace Studies and Human Rights at Al-Fasher University in 
North Darfur and discussed the role of academic institutions in the promotion and 
protection of human rights in the Sudan.  
</p>
<p>9. In North Kordofan, the Independent Expert met with the deputy Governor and other 
state officials. He visited a temporary shelter for displaced persons and a religious centre 
that has been attacked by rebels in April 2013. In Blue Nile state, the Independent Expert 
held meetings with the Governor and other state officials, including the head of the 
Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC). He also had fruitful discussions about the 
humanitarian situation with United Nations agencies working in the state. 
</p>
<p>10. The Independent Expert notes that the recommendations made during the 2011 
universal periodic review (UPR) of the Sudan continue to serve as the main entry point for 
the implementation of his mandate. In his engagement with the Government and other 
stakeholders, the Independent Expert stressed his results-oriented approach to the 
implementation of the mandate, which entreats the Government to publish periodic reports 
on tangible results and progress made in the implementation of the UPR recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Background 
</b></p>
<p>11. A mixture of political, social and economic challenges has adversely affected the 
general human rights situation in the Sudan. The country has suffered from two long civil 
wars that have not fully ended to date. The Darfur conflict, which erupted in 2003, has been 
a major human rights tragedy for the country. Darfur continues to be characterized by 
widespread human rights violations and large-scale civilian displacements due to the 
persistence of fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces and armed opposition groups 
in the region. Up to 1.9 million people are still displaced throughout the region, relying on 
humanitarian agencies to provide basic services. The Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) 
signed in 2006 between the Government of the Sudan and a faction of the Sudan Liberation 
Army (SLA) did not succeed in ending the conflict. Political progress has however been 
made with the signing of the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur (DDPD) between the 
Government and some of the armed opposition groups. The DDPD remains the only viable 
roadmap for peace in Darfur, despite its very slow implementation.  
</p>
<p>12. The North-South Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) of 2005 had also raised 
hopes for lasting peace in the country, and paved the way for the independence of South 
Sudan in 2011. Yet the Sudan continues to face a number of new challenges following the 
independence of South Sudan due to a number of thorny issues left unresolved under the </p>


<p>CPA. While some progress has been made in legislative and institutional reforms under the 
CPA, the overall democratic transformation of the country has remained precarious. Sudan 
has yet to adopt a new permanent constitution following the secession of South Sudan; 
public debate over the constitution is proceeding amid increasing polarization over issues 
such as the role of religion in the country, decentralization of power and wealth sharing 
between the different regions of the Sudan. This period provides an opportunity for the 
country to adopt a permanent democratic constitution that is inclusive and aimed at 
realizing a lasting democracy and political stability for the country. At the same time, parts 
of the legal framework, such as the National Security Act and the Criminal Act, infringe 
fundamental human rights and freedoms. Restrictions on civil and political rights and the 
curtailment of freedom of expression and the press have persisted. Increasing demands by 
political opposition groups, civil society organizations and students for democratic reforms 
have been met with a heavy hand by the authorities, including arrests and detention by the 
security forces, and impunity remains a recurring problem.  
</p>
<p>13. In the three Protocol Areas of Abyei, South Kordofan and Blue Nile, outbreaks of 
fighting have led to widespread human rights violations and large-scale displacements. The 
referendum on the final status of Abyei, and the popular consultation processes in South 
Kordofan and Blue Nile envisaged under the CPA, did not take place due to fighting in 
these areas.   
</p>
<p>14. Sudan has yet to ratify key international human rights treaties, such as the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment, and the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The 
country underwent the universal periodic review (UPR) by the Human Rights Council in 
May 2011. In spite of the positive achievements noted by the Government, a number of 
concerns and issues were raised during the review, including with regard to continuing 
discriminatory laws against women and the prevalence of sexual and gender-based violence 
in Darfur.  
</p>
<p>15. In meetings with the Independent Expert, many Government officials repeatedly 
asserted that the general human rights situation in the Sudan should be understood in the 
context of the decades of armed conflicts which have afflicted the country. The 
Independent Expert notes that human rights and international humanitarian law must be 
fully respected even in times of armed conflict. All parties involved in the armed conflicts &#8211;  
Government forces and rebel groups alike &#8211; therefore, have a responsibility to respect 
human rights at all times.   
</p>
<p><b> IV. Assessment of progress made by the Government towards 
improving the human rights situation 
</b></p>
<p>16. While the general human rights situation in the Sudan has remained unstable, 
especially in conflict-affected areas like Darfur, South Kordofan and Blue Nile, the 
Government continues to make progress in legislative and institutional developments aimed 
at improving the situation of human rights in the country. In addition, human rights 
awareness has improved across the different government sectors and relative improvement 
can be seen among the general population. Nonetheless, effective implementation and 
practical realization of most of the Government&#8217;s human rights policies on the ground 
remain generally slow. 
</p>
<p>17. In discussions with Government officials, the Independent Expert pointed out the 
need for the Government to move from merely initiating human rights policies to a results-
oriented approach of ensuring the practical realization of adopted human rights policies 
across the relevant institutions in the country.  The Independent Expert continued to stress </p>


<p>the importance of transparency and the need for the Government to disseminate its human 
rights strategies and results achieved to encourage public evaluation and more 
accountability for human rights violations.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Implementation of the recommendations of the Universal Periodic 
</b></p>
<p><b>Review 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Government has continued to take the necessary steps towards implementing 
the recommendations of the 2011 Universal Periodic Review, including drawing up a 
detailed action plan for their implementation. In addition, it has conducted workshops 
across the country to assist authorities and Government institutions in the states to 
familiarize themselves with the recommendations and the time frame for implementation. 
Priority areas identified in the implementation plan for 2013 include administration of 
justice, law reform and ratification of some international human rights treaties. A 
committee of experts was set up to study the reform of laws such as the Criminal Procedure 
Act, the Criminal Act, the Evidence Act, the Personal Status Law and the Labour Act, and 
it has submitted its recommendations to the Government for consideration. The 
Government is also working on the amendment of the Press and Publication Act of 2009 to 
ensure more protection for journalists and newspaper publishers. The Independent Expert 
commends the Government for taking these positive steps towards implementing the UPR 
recommendations. The Independent Expert would like to recommend that the law reform 
process be extended to include the reform of the 2010 National Security Act, which 
continues to encroach on the enjoyment of fundamental human rights in the country. The 
Government should act expeditiously on the recommendations of the Committee in order to 
take the law reform process forward quickly and effectively.   
</p>
<p>19. The Independent Expert notes the strong cooperation between the Government and 
the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) with regard to the implementation of 
the UPR recommendations, which must be encouraged and sustained. The Government 
should aim for the full practical implementation of its action plan on the UPR 
recommendations and make a particular effort to realize tangible results in the areas of 
administration of justice, law reform and ratification of identified international human 
rights treaties, as priority areas specified in the action plan for 2013. In following the 
Independent Expert&#8217;s results-oriented approach, the Government should evaluate and 
publish the results achieved in the implementation of these three specified areas at the end 
of 2013.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Legislative and institutional development 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Government has made progress in putting in place necessary legislation and 
institutional mechanisms for improving the situation of human rights in the country. The 
Bill of Rights provisions in the current interim national constitution serve as an important 
framework for the protection of human rights in the country. The Government has promised 
to retain these provisions in the new permanent constitution currently under discussion, 
which is a step in the right direction. The Government should, however, ensure that the full 
import of the Bill of Rights is realized by ensuring that operations of all State organs, 
particularly NSS, are in conformity with the constitution and international human rights 
standards.  
</p>
<p>21. The Independent Expert notes the important roles played by various bodies in the 
improvement of the human rights situation in the country. These include the Advisory 
Council on Human Rights (ACHR), the National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR), 
the Human Rights Committee of the National Assembly, the Unit for Combating Violence </p>


<p>Against Women and Children, the National Council for Child Welfare, the Commission for 
the Rights of Non-Muslims in Khartoum State, the Special Prosecutor for Darfur crimes, 
the judiciary and the police. The Independent Expert&#8217;s assessment of the effectiveness of 
these bodies and their respective technical assistance needs is provided in chapter VI of this 
report. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Adoption of the 10-year National Action Plan for the Protection of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>22. Further to the Independent Expert&#8217;s recommendations, the Government has adopted 
a 10-year national action plan for the protection of human rights in the Sudan, which was 
formally launched in June 2013. The action plan focuses on eight major objectives, 
including in the following areas: human rights education, law reform, awareness-raising 
and capacity-building for human rights and international humanitarian law and 
strengthening partnership between Government and civil society organizations.  The plan is 
expected to be reviewed biannually to evaluate progress made in its implementation. 
However, details of the plan are yet to be fully sorted out. The plan marks a positive step 
and provides a clear strategy for the improvement of human rights in the country, and the 
Government should expedite its implementation.  The Government should also establish a 
high-level body to oversee its implementation, and the ACHR and NCHR should be tasked 
with monitoring progress made in its implementation. In following the results-oriented 
approach, the Government should publish an annual report of the tangible results achieved 
under the national action plan for the protection of human rights to allow the public to 
evaluate the progress made in its implementation.   
</p>
<p><b> V. Main human rights challenges  
</b></p>
<p>23. In spite of progress made in policy, legislative and institutional development, as 
described above, Sudan continues to face enormous human rights challenges. The 
operations of Government security agencies, particularly NSS, have impeded the enjoyment 
of basic civil and political rights, and recurrent armed conflicts between Government forces 
and armed rebel groups as well as inter- and intra-tribal clashes continue to result in serious 
human rights violations and large-scale displacement of civilians in different parts of the 
country. The security situation in the conflict-affected regions of the country has remained 
precarious, and impunity for human rights violations remains a recurring problem. The 
absence, or sometimes weak presence, of formal State institutions in remote parts of the 
country accounts for the difficult human rights situation in those areas. The enjoyment of 
economic, social and cultural rights also needs to be improved to address the severe poverty 
affecting particularly women and children in rural areas.  
</p>
<p>24. The Independent Expert discussed these challenges in his meetings with 
Government representatives and he hopes that the Government will commit to addressing 
them urgently as part of its efforts towards improving the human rights situation in the 
country. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Curtailment of the activities of civil society organizations 
</b></p>
<p>25. In his last report, the Independent Expert highlighted the important role of civil 
society organizations and urged the Government to foster a more conducive environment 
for their operations in the Sudan. Regrettably, the Government continued to clamp down on 
the activities of these organizations during the reporting period. In December 2012, the 
Government shut down the operations of three organizations and one literary forum. NSS </p>


<p>subsequently prevented a group of organizations from submitting a complaint against the 
Government&#8217;s decision to the NCHR. The action of NSS was a clear violation of the right 
of these organizations to protest as well as a hindrance to the statutory function of the 
NCHR to receive petitions from the public. The NCHR appropriately objected to the NSS 
action and issued a press release and a written complaint to the President of the Republic.  
</p>
<p>26. These actions by the security agencies stifle free speech and the effective operations 
of civil society organizations in the Sudan and are contrary to the obligation of the Sudan to 
respect and protect the right to freedom of assembly and expression as guaranteed under its 
interim constitution and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which 
the Sudan is a State party. Civil society organizations are the bedrock for the protection and 
promotion of human rights in a democratic society and the Government must ensure that 
they are able to operate freely and that their right to freedom of assembly and expression is 
fully respected.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Press censorship 
</b></p>
<p>27. Press censorship by government security agents continued unabated during the 
reporting period. Despite the Independent Expert&#8217;s call for the Government to desist from 
this practice, the Government continues to arbitrarily close down newspapers and arrest 
journalists for publishing stories deemed critical of the Government. Although the 
Government announced in May 2013 that it had put an end to press censorship, NSS 
ordered up to four newspapers to cease operations in June 2013. Pre-publication censorship 
continues to be used against newspapers and some journalists were ordered to cease their 
newspaper columns. Security agencies continue to intimidate and instil fear of arrest in 
journalists, which consequently impedes press freedom, freedom of opinion and freedom of 
expression. The importance of press freedom and freedom of expression in a democratic 
society is paramount, and the Government should fully guarantee these rights. The 
Government is also encouraged to implement its plans to train law enforcement and 
security officers to respect the right to freedom of speech and amend the Press and 
Publication Act to give more protection to journalists and newspaper publishers. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Arbitrary arrests and detentions  
</b></p>
<p>28. In January 2013, some political opposition figures were arrested and detained 
without charge by NSS on allegations of holding illegal meetings outside the country. At 
the end of his mission to the Sudan in February 2013, the Independent Expert called on the 
Government to either release the detainees or promptly charge them with recognizable 
offences before a court of law. The Government eventually released the said political 
detainees in April 2013 without any charges. Similarly, at a meeting with the ACHR in 
June 2013, the Independent Expert raised concerns about 34 women from Kadugli in South 
Kordofan who had been arbitrarily detained without charge. The Government subsequently 
released the women in July 2013 without any charges.  
</p>
<p>29. In April 2013, the Government announced that all political prisoners would be 
released. While it has been reported that some political prisoners have since been released, 
it is not clear whether all have been released. The Government should fulfil its pledge by 
releasing all political prisoners still in detention and making this public. 
</p>
<p>30. Furthermore, in July 2013, 12 people were reported to have been arrested and 
detained without charge by government security agents in Abu Karinka locality (East 
Darfur) for participating in a protest in the area.   </p>


<p>31. All of the above incidents of arbitrary arrest and detention are clear violations of the 
right to liberty and security as guaranteed under the interim constitution of the Sudan and 
article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Government and 
its security agents should desist from arbitrary arrests and detention to ensure full respect 
for the right to liberty and security of individuals. All arrests and detentions by the 
Government must be carried out in accordance with due process and relevant human rights 
guarantees. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Freedom of religion 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Independent Expert received complaints from different quarters about 
discrimination against non-Muslims &#8211; particularly in Khartoum &#8211; and incidents of arrests of 
individuals, raiding of churches and seizure of Christian literature by security agents due to 
allegations of Christian proselytization in the country. The right to freedom of religion is 
enshrined in the interim constitution of the Sudan and article 18 of the International 
Covenant. The interim constitution also established the Commission for the Rights of Non-
Muslims in Khartoum State to ensure that their rights are protected in accordance with the 
constitution. The Sudan has an obligation to ensure that these provisions on the right to 
freedom of religion are fully respected without discrimination.  
</p>
<p><b> E. 2010 National Security Act  
</b></p>
<p>33. The operations of the National Security Service (NSS) have had an adverse impact 
on the enjoyment of civil and political rights, particularly press freedom, freedom of 
expression, freedom of assembly, right to liberty, political participation and civil society 
activities. The activities of NSS also impinge on the role of the police as the legitimate law 
enforcement institution in a democratic society. This has been a source of concern in the 
human rights community both nationally and internationally. The Director of NSS noted in 
his meeting with the Independent Expert that NSS operates within its enabling law, namely 
the 2010 National Security Act. As a State organ, NSS has an obligation to fully respect 
human rights when carrying out its legitimate functions.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Women and ch</b>ildren&#8217;s rights<b> 
</b></p>
<p>34. Women and children are among the most vulnerable groups in the Sudan, especially 
in regions affected by conflict. The protection of women and children&#8217;s rights &#8211; particularly 
in conflict-affected areas &#8211;, therefore, is a matter of serious concern. Women are forced, by 
various circumstances, to engage in routine livelihood activities, such as fetching firewood, 
farming and animal grazing, to support their families. These activities often expose them to 
security risks, including sexual and gender-based violence. In Darfur, UNAMID provided 
technical assistance in the form of workshops on sexual and gender-based violence for a 
total of 140 government officials and community leaders between April and June 2013. The 
head of the North Darfur judiciary expressed particular concern about the impact of the 
conflict in Darfur on children and emphasized the need for improvement in juvenile justice. 
Girl children are also exposed to harmful cultural practices, such as female genital 
mutilation (FGM), that infringe their fundamental human rights.  
</p>
<p>35. The interim constitution guarantees the rights of women and children, but the Sudan 
has ratified only the Convention on the Rights of the Child; it has not yet ratified the 
Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, and this, in essence, 
denies women the broader human rights protection provided under international law.  </p>


<p><b> G. Armed conflicts and protection of civilians 
</b></p>
<p>36. Armed conflicts and lack of security continue to be major sources of human rights 
violations in different parts of the Sudan. Darfur, South Kordofan and Blue Nile, 
specifically, continue to experience sporadic cycles of armed conflicts, violent attacks and 
banditry, which have had an effect on civilians during the reporting period.  
</p>
<p><b>  Darfur 
</b></p>
<p>37. The dynamics of the conflicts in Darfur have evolved over the last 10 years. The 
armed attacks in the region have taken different forms, including tribal clashes, aerial 
strikes by the Sudanese Air Force (SAF) and clashes between pro-Government militia and 
armed rebels, all of which have led to civilian casualties, destruction of property and 
displacements. While there has been relative improvement over the years, as a result of the 
good work of UNAMID and other United Nations agencies working in the region, the 
security situation remains volatile and precarious.1  
</p>
<p>38. In North Darfur, tribal clashes in Jebel Amir, Kutum, Abu Deleg, Saraf Omra and 
Kabkabiya have led to large civilian casualties and displacements. November 2012 to 
March 2013 witnessed an upsurge in fighting between the SAF and rebel groups, 
particularly in East and South Darfur, and violent clashes between different Arab tribes in 
North, South, West and Central Darfur, from January to August 2013, which resulted in 
continuing insecurity, human rights violations, destruction and looting of property as well 
as civilian displacements.  
</p>
<p>39. In July and August 2013, ongoing clashes between the Rezeigat and Maaliya tribes 
in East Darfur reportedly resulted in many civilians being killed. There were also reports of 
SAF aerial strikes on suspected armed rebel positions in East Jebel Mara locality in South 
Darfur, the Afara mountains and Tabit in North Darfur, and Um Gonya area in South 
Darfur. Civilians continue to bear the brunt of these armed attacks and clashes which result 
in serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, including arbitrary 
deprivation of life, injury to persons, destruction and looting of homes and businesses, 
destruction of livestock and mass displacements. 
</p>
<p>40. Over the last six months, the number of people displaced in Darfur increased 
considerably. The influx of new internally displaced persons (IDPs) in different camps in 
Darfur &#8211; such as Al Salam, Kalma, Otash, Dereige, Graida and Katalya &#8211; has stretched the 
capacity of humanitarian actors to provide assistance in a timely manner. According to the 
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), 235,000 people were newly 
displaced between January 2013 and April 2013.2 In July 2013, the estimated number of 
displaced persons rose to 300,000, exceeding the combined total of displaced persons in 
Darfur within the past two years.3  
</p>
<p>41. The security and safety of IDPs in Darfur remain a matter of grave concern. While 
many IDPs have expressed the desire to return to their places of origin, the ongoing armed 
conflicts and violent clashes make it difficult for them to do so. During his visits to Darfur,

<p> 3 Report of the Secretary-General on the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, 
S/2013/420, para. 13. </p>


<p>the Independent Expert observed the difficult conditions faced by IDPs in Darfur, 
especially women and children. In Otash camp in South Darfur, the IDPs had resorted to 
using local materials to construct makeshift shelters in the camp, while others complained 
of insufficient food and water. The Independent Expert raised concern about the situation 
with the Governor of South Darfur and other state officials, urging them to take action to 
resolve the problems. The Independent Expert urges the Government of the Sudan and 
relevant United Nations agencies to assist in addressing the humanitarian needs in the IDP 
camps as a matter of urgency. 
</p>
<p>42. The situation in Darfur continues to be a challenge for the Government. The 
Government&#8217;s duty to protect civilians and hold alleged offenders accountable has been 
</p>
<p>demonstrably weak &#8211; a situation that has encouraged impunity in some places. The 
apparent lack of effective law enforcement is evident in areas such as Kutum locality in 
North Darfur, where security has not been restored since the 2012 attacks on Kassab and 
Fataborno IDP camps and Kutum town. Also in Tawilla, North Darfur, only the Sudanese 
Armed Forces and the Central Reserve Police have been exercising authority in the area 
since December 2012. All other law enforcement components, including the regular police, 
have been relocated to El Fasher, the state capital. Also, due to insecurity, judicial services 
in Kutum and Gereida in South Darfur have not been functional, thus limiting access to 
justice for most civilians in these localities. 
</p>
<p>43. In order to fight impunity and also fulfil the Sudan&#8217;s obligations under the Doha 
Document for Peace in Darfur (DDPD), in January 2012, the Government appointed a new 
Special Prosecutor for Darfur crimes (the fifth Special Prosecutor to be appointed since 
2003) to investigate and bring to justice those responsible for serious crimes and human 
rights violations related to the Darfur conflict. During his mission to the Sudan in February 
2013, the Independent Expert raised concerns about the slow pace of prosecution of the 
Darfur conflict-related crimes. Furthermore, he noted that Darfur conflict-related cases 
were being tried in the ordinary courts instead of the Special Court created specifically for 
these crimes. The Special Prosecutor has, however, confirmed that prosecution of crimes in 
the Special Court has now commenced. The Independent Expert also noted that the Justice, 
Truth and Reconciliation Commission established under the DDPD has not been able to 
function owing to lack of funding. In a meeting with the Independent Expert in February 
2013, the Darfur Regional Authority (DRA) indicated that the Government had approved 
the release of funds to support the operation of the Commission.   
</p>
<p>44. The Independent Expert emphasizes the importance of the full implementation of the 
DDPD and calls on the Government of the Sudan and the international community to fulfil 
their respective commitments under the agreement. Realizing peace and security in Darfur 
is necessary for ensuring improvement of the human rights situation in the region. The 
DDPD provides the only viable roadmap for peace in Darfur and must be supported by all 
stakeholders. The full implementation of the DDPD is therefore essential and all 
stakeholders must renew their commitment in that regard. 
</p>
<p>45. UNAMID has provided technical assistance to the Government in order to build its 
capacity to recognize, analyse and proactively address human rights issues in Darfur. Since 
August 2012, it has conducted up to 40 human rights training sessions and workshops for 
more than 1,200 people, including state legislators, local government authorities, judges, 
prosecutors, private-sector lawyers, teachers, native administrators and IDPs in Darfur.  
</p>
<p><b>  South Kordofan  
</b></p>
<p>46. The human rights situation in South Kordofan state remains precarious, with 
civilians bearing the brunt of sporadic cycles of fighting between Government and rebel 
forces. For security reasons, the Independent Expert could not visit the state as originally 
planned. On 14 June 2013, when he arrived in the Sudan for his second visit to the country, </p>


<p>the airport of the state capital, Kadugli, was shelled by the Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation 
Army-North (SPLA-N) resulting in the death of a United Nations peacekeeper and 
wounding two others. 
</p>
<p>47.  Reported hostilities between Government forces and the SPLA-N continue to 
seriously impact the lives of civilians in South Kordofan. There have been widespread 
reports by local and international human rights monitors of indiscriminate aerial strikes by 
SAF in different parts of the state, which have resulted in civilian deaths, injuries, 
destruction of homes, farmlands and large displacements. Hundreds of thousands of 
civilians are reported to have fled into neighbouring South Sudan and Ethiopia, while those 
who remain face rapidly deteriorating humanitarian conditions. The United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that 240,000 people had fled into South 
Sudan and Ethiopia by the end of October 2012. 
</p>
<p>48. In April 2013, the fighting in South Kordofan spilled over into neighbouring North 
Kordofan state. Rebels from the Sudanese Revolutionary Front attacked the villages of Abu 
Kershola, Jamjaka, El-Feed, Umm Abdullah in South Kordofan, and Umm Rowaba, Allah 
Kareem, El-Sameh and El-Rahd in North Kordofan, which resulted in civilian deaths, 
injuries, destruction of civilian properties and massive displacements of the civilian 
population. The Independent Expert visited some of the displaced victims who were 
camped in a school compound in Al-Rahd, North Kordofan, and heard disturbing accounts 
of the ordeal they went through during the attacks. In July 2013, the same rebel group 
attacked a military post in the Sidreah area of North Kordofan, which led to civilians 
fleeing the area. While the Government of the Sudan bears primary responsibility for 
protecting the lives and properties of civilians, all parties to the conflict have a  
responsibility to respect the human rights of civilians at all times. Likewise, attacks on 
civilians by rebel groups should be condemned in the strongest terms. 
</p>
<p><b>  Blue Nile  
</b></p>
<p>49. The intensity of fighting in Blue Nile State has diminished considerably compared to 
the early days of the conflict in 2011. Nevertheless, sporadic fighting between SAF and 
SPLA-N continues to result in waves of civilian displacements in the southern part of the 
state. There has, however, been some positive development, notably the opening of access 
for delivery of humanitarian assistance in Government-controlled areas in the state. Thus, 
the World Food Programme was able to provide food assistance to 84,000 people, and 
UNHCR delivered emergency shelter and non-food items to 5,000 people by late May 
</p><p>2013.  
</p>
<p>50. A significant number of civilians remain trapped in rebel-controlled areas as a result 
of continued fighting in the region. Indiscriminate aerial strikes by SAF are of particular 
concern. The Independent Expert could not visit these areas, but received reports indicating 
that the humanitarian situation there continues to deteriorate. Many displaced and 
vulnerable civilians have been forced to move further south without access to basic 
necessities like water and food. United Nations and humanitarian agencies are unable to 
make a humanitarian assessment or deliver assistance in SPLM-N-controlled areas. Talks 
between the Government of the Sudan and SPLM-N &#8211; under the auspices of the African 
Union in Addis Ababa in April 2013 &#8211; to open up humanitarian access proved futile.  
Reports about aerial strikes by SAF and the terrible situation in rebel-controlled areas of 
Blue Nile paint a very worrying picture.   
</p>
<p>51. The Independent Expert expressed concern about the precarious human rights 
situation in the state during his meeting with the Governor and other interlocutors. There 
was general recognition that the continuing armed conflicts in the region, accompanied by 
the lack of security, have contributed to the deteriorating human rights situation in the state. 
The Independent Expert stresses the obligation and responsibility of both the Government </p>


<p>and rebel forces to protect human rights, even during armed conflict, and the need to allow 
unhindered humanitarian access to civilians affected by such conflict. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Humanitarian aid and access to victims  
</b></p>
<p>52. The question of the Government granting timely and full access to humanitarian 
agencies so as to facilitate humanitarian assistance to victims of conflict in affected areas is 
a matter of grave concern. The Independent Expert discussed this with the Commissioner 
General of HAC who stressed that the humanitarian situation has improved over the years. 
The Commissioner General also indicated that the Government, in collaboration with 
United Nations agencies and relevant international aid organizations, was taking further 
steps towards improving the situation. In March 2013, HAC published new directives 
aimed at improving humanitarian access in the country.4  The Independent Expert considers 
that the implementation of the new directives should be effectively monitored in order to 
have the desired effect of addressing the recurring problem of humanitarian access, 
particularly in Darfur, South Kordofan and Blue Nile states. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Independent Expert notes the important need to improve the realization of 
economic, social and cultural rights in the Sudan to effectively address poverty and other 
socioeconomic problems of the population, particularly in the rural parts of the country. 
Improving economic and social conditions will have a very positive impact on ending the 
persistent conflict that has afflicted the country. In this context, the Independent Expert 
notes that, among others, the underlying cause of the recent tribal clashes in Darfur was 
access to resources. In Jebel Amir and El Sireaf, tribal clashes between rival Arab tribes 
were over control of artisanal goldmines in the area, while control of the locality where 
gum arabic is produced appears to have triggered the fighting in Katalya and Ed El Fursan 
in South Darfur in early February 2013. Similarly, the clashes in Um Dukhum in Central 
Darfur and Rehad el Birdi in South Darfur in April started because of disputes between the 
local communities over control of grazing, land and water resources.  
</p>
<p>54. The Independent Expert notes that lack of access to basic social services such as 
clean water, education, health facilities and infrastructure has exacerbated the already 
impoverished situation in most rural parts of the Sudan. While the Government has initiated 
development projects, such as the Merowe Dam and Roseiris Heightening projects, to 
address these deficits, proper structural measures and mid- to long-term economic policy 
planning and implementation are necessary to ensure effective alleviation of poverty at the 
grassroots level. The international community is also encouraged to provide the country 
with the needed financial assistance for the realization of economic, social and cultural 
rights, as well as support for early recovery initiatives in conflict-affected areas. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Assessment of technical assistance and capacity-building 
needs 
</b></p>
<p>55. In his discussions with the Government and other stakeholders, the Independent 
Expert ascertained the roles of different bodies in the Sudan engaged in the promotion and 
</p>
<p>  
 4 Humanitarian Aid Commission, &#8220;Directives for Humanitarian Works, 2013&#8221;. </p>


<p>protection of human rights, with a view to identifying their technical assistance and 
capacity-building needs.   
</p>
<p><b>  Advisory Council on Human Rights  
</b></p>
<p>56. The Advisory Council on Human Rights (ACHR) continues to be the main 
coordinating body for the implementation of the UPR recommendations, inculcating a 
human rights culture across Government institutions and coordinating the Government&#8217;s 
human rights engagement with partner agencies and the public. ACHR has played a 
significant role in creating human rights awareness, particularly within the government 
sector. ACHR should, however, operate in a more transparent manner by issuing regular 
reports of its activities to the public, listing the tangible results achieved in human rights 
promotion and protection. This would not only promote a results-oriented approach, but 
would also enable the public to evaluate its achievements.  
</p>
<p>57. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has been a key partner in 
providing useful technical assistance and support to the Advisory Council towards 
implementation of the UPR recommendations. UNDP has provided assistance for projects 
that are already under way, including the organization of consultative workshops for 
Government institutions, furnishing and equipping the training hall of the Ministry of 
Justice to support its training activities, and training some 900 Government officers on 
human rights promotion and protection so as to facilitate the implementation of the UPR 
recommendations in the different states. These technical assistance and capacity-building 
projects can be sustained through funding from other sources to bridge current UNDP 
funding gaps. ACHR has compiled a consolidated document on its technical assistance and 
capacity-building needs, with estimated costs for each of the programmes outlined. A copy 
of the document can be obtained from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights. The projects listed therein relate to many of the major human rights 
challenges identified in this report. 
</p>
<p><b>  National Commission for Human Rights  
</b></p>
<p>58. The Independent Expert remains convinced of the important role of the National 
Commission for Human Rights (NCHR) in improving the human rights situation in the 
Sudan. During the reporting period, NCHR organized a number of training and awareness-
raising workshops for Government representatives and civil society organizations in 
different parts of the country, including Khartoum, Port Sudan, Kadugli, Nyala and Gadarif. 
The Commission has also engaged in constructive dialogue with relevant Government 
organs and agencies, including the judiciary, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the 
Constitutional Court and NSS, on different human rights concerns such as press censorship, 
political detentions and the effect of the application of the 2010 National Security Act on 
the enjoyment of human rights in the country. The Commission also visited Darfur, South 
Kordofan and Blue Nile states to gather information on human rights, and has received 38 
human rights complaints, mostly in respect of the operations of state security organs, which 
it is currently investigating. The Commission has made some good operational progress, 
but needs to deliver on its substantive mandate of ensuring improvement in the human 
rights situation in the Sudan.  
</p>
<p>59. NCHR confirmed that the Government has approved its current budget and has 
disbursed funds for its operations. The Commission also received support from 
international partners including the Swiss and British Governments. Under a four-year 
agreement with UNDP, the Commission will receive support in different areas of its 
operations from 2012 to 2016. UNDP has also loaned the Commission two vehicles, and 
provided funding for the establishment of four regional offices to enable the Commission to 
extend its operations nationwide. NCHR has further initiated plans to sponsor its members </p>


<p>to attend training programmes and visit the national human rights commissions of South 
Africa, Rwanda and Morocco in order to benefit from their experiences and best practices. 
Plans are also under way to establish a human rights library for the Commission&#8217;s 
headquarters in Khartoum and proposed branches in the different regions of the Sudan.  
These initiatives are necessary for enhancing the Commission&#8217;s effectiveness. There is a 
need for continued support to the Commission, either through funding from UNDP or 
through direct bilateral assistance to the Commission from other donors to improve its 
effectiveness. 
</p>
<p><b>  Human Rights Committee of the National Assembly  
</b></p>
<p>60. In its meeting with the Independent Expert, the Human Rights Committee of the 
National Assembly (HRCNA) emphasized its role as a standing committee in the 
legislature for promoting and protecting human rights. Through its legislative oversight 
functions, the Committee ensures that all laws passed by the Legislature are in conformity 
with the Constitution and the international human rights obligations of the Sudan. This role 
can ensure improvement of the human rights situation through the enactment of human 
rights-compliant laws. In following the Independent Expert&#8217;s results-oriented approach, 
HRCNA should issue annual reports of its human rights interventions and inputs on 
legislation adopted by the National Assembly. To help improve its capacity to fulfil its role 
more effectively, HRCNA has requested technical assistance and training for its members, 
which the Independent Expert supports. 
</p>
<p><b>  Unit for Combating Violence against Women and Children 
</b></p>
<p>61. The Independent Expert notes the important role played by the Unit for Combating 
Violence against Women and Children in promoting and protecting the rights of women 
and children in the Sudan. The Independent Expert commends the Unit for initiating a five-
year (2012-2016) national strategic plan aimed at combating violence against women and 
children. Based on information gathered by the Independent Expert on the situation of 
women and children in places like Darfur and other conflict-affected areas, the Unit needs 
to ensure that its activities reach rural areas more effectively in order to ensure protection of 
women and children at the grassroots level of society. In following the Independent 
Expert&#8217;s results-oriented approach, the Unit should publish an annual report on tangible 
results achieved in its five-year national strategic plan for public evaluation. 
</p>
<p>62. The Government should provide adequate funding for the Unit to enable it to fulfil 
its objectives effectively. International partners are also encouraged to provide the 
necessary technical assistance and capacity-building to help the Unit realize the objectives 
of its national strategic plan.  
</p>
<p><b>  National Council for Child Welfare 
</b></p>
<p>63. The National Council for Child Welfare (NCCW) also has an important role to play 
in respect of ensuring children&#8217;s rights and welfare in the Sudan. The Independent Expert 
</p>
<p>commends the Council&#8217;s role in promoting the Sudanese Child Act of 2010 and its ongoing 
awareness-raising and advocacy campaigns on child rights issues in the Sudan. The 
Council&#8217;s national programme for the abolition of female genital mutilation (FGM) &#8211; a 
practice that is prevalent in the Sudan &#8211;, with a strategy aimed at eradicating the practice in 
the Sudan by 2018 is very laudable. The practice of FGM is a violation of the rights of 
children and contrary to the provisions of articles 19 and 24, paragraph 3, of the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child, and article 21 of the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare 
of the Child, both of which the Sudan is a State party. NCCW should extend its activities to 
the rural areas to ensure that the rights and welfare of children are effectively protected at 
the grassroots levels. The legislative council in South Darfur passed a law in 2013 making </p>


<p>FGM a crime in the state. Similar laws have been passed by the legislative councils of 
South Kordofan, El Gedarif and Red Sea states. The Independent Expert encourages other 
states to pass similar laws. NCCW should intensify its awareness-raising campaigns to 
ensure the eradication of FGM in the Sudan by 2018. It should follow a results-oriented 
approach and publish an annual report of tangible results achieved under the programme. 
The Independent Expert urges international partners to support NCCW by providing 
technical assistance and capacity-building training so as to enhance its effectiveness. 
</p>
<p><b>  Judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>64. In his meeting with the Chief Justice and other senior members of the judiciary, the 
Independent Expert highlighted the important role of the Sudanese judiciary in promoting 
the rule of law and ensuring human rights are guaranteed in the country. To fulfil this role 
effectively, it is crucial for the judiciary to be independent of other arms of Government. 
The Chief Justice emphasized the independence of the Sudanese judiciary, noting that the 
separation of the judiciary from the Ministry of Justice represents an aspect of its 
independence from the executive arm of Government. However, there is a low level of 
confidence among the national civil society and human rights community about the ability 
of the Sudanese judiciary to guarantee the protection of human rights in the Sudan. The 
judiciary must ensure that it commands a high level of public confidence by fully upholding 
the constitution and rule of law in the Sudan.  
</p>
<p>65. While the higher echelon of the judiciary is aware of the need to uphold human 
rights standards in the administration of justice, the lower courts operating in rural areas 
would benefit from training in human rights. The operations of some rural courts in 
conflict-affected regions have not been fully functional because of intermittent armed 
attacks and lack of security. The Government should ensure that courts in these areas are 
fully functional in order to guarantee access to justice.    
</p>
<p>66. The Sudanese judiciary has benefitted from capacity-building projects with 
international partners through UNDP and UNAMID, which have helped it enhance its 
capacity to implement human rights and the rule of law, especially at senior levels. Since 
August 2012, UNAMID has delivered 23 training sessions and workshops on justice and 
corrections issues to 679 participants, including members of the judiciary and legal 
practitioners in Darfur. Regular capacity-building of judicial staff is essential to ensure the 
effective functioning of the judiciary. The Chief Justice and the senior members of the 
judiciary met in Darfur and highlighted the need for continued capacity-building and 
technical assistance to enable the judiciary to improve its effectiveness, particularly in the 
area of human rights and the rule of law. 
</p>
<p><b>  Police  
</b></p>
<p>67. The police play an important role in the protection of human rights in the Sudan, 
especially in the areas of law enforcement, preventing and investigating crimes, ensuring 
safety and security as well as generally protecting society. In his meeting with the 
Independent Expert, the Deputy Director General of Police highlighted that the police were 
doing their best to fulfil that role in the Sudan, but noted that there were a number of 
challenges due to the ongoing conflicts in different parts of the country. The Police College 
and other police training institutions have incorporated human rights education into their 
training programmes, so that all members of the police force are made aware of their 
human rights responsibilities in the performance of their duties. However, there is evident 
lack of effective law enforcement by the police in some conflict-affected areas of the 
country. 
</p>
<p>68. The police force has received useful training in community policing and other 
capacity-building workshops from international partners and UNAMID, which have helped </p>


<p>to improve police and community relations in many localities. Between April and June 
2013, UNAMID trained a total of 390 police personnel on human rights, community 
policing and gender-based violence in Darfur. It also trained 86 community policing 
volunteers and set up a total of 142 community safety committees in camps and villages. 
The Deputy Director General of Police, however, highlighted the need for further technical 
assistance and capacity-building to help the police service to continue to meet the human 
rights challenges confronting it in the discharge of its role.  
</p>
<p><b>  Special Prosecutor for Darfur crimes 
</b></p>
<p>69. The Special Prosecutor for Darfur crimes recently commenced the prosecution of 
Darfur conflict-related crimes in the Darfur Special Court. The Office of the Special 
Prosecutor is currently dealing with some 54 cases, 8 of which have already been decided 
by the courts. In order to ensure transparency, and following the Independent Expert&#8217;s 
results-oriented approach, the Special Prosecutor should publish periodic reports on 
tangible results achieved so that the public could evaluate its work.  The Office of the 
Special Prosecutor for Darfur crimes has requested technical assistance and capacity-
building from the international partners, including training for staff to build expertise to 
enable them to discharge their responsibilities effectively. In view of the Special 
Prosecutor&#8217;s very important role of ensuring justice in Darfur, the Independent Expert urges 
international partners to provide the Office with the necessary technical assistance and 
capacity-building, including training for staff, especially prosecutors.  
</p>
<p><b>  Civil society organizations 
</b></p>
<p>70. The Independent Expert met with representatives of civil society organizations in 
Khartoum, North Darfur, South Darfur and North Kordofan. In general, the representatives 
complained about censorship and intimidation by the Government. They also emphasized 
their need for technical assistance and capacity-building in order to enhance their human 
rights activities.  
</p>
<p>71. Various civil society organizations received relevant training and technical 
assistance through UNDP, UNAMID and NCHR, which has helped them to improve their 
competences in different aspects of human rights-related work. The Independent Expert 
urges the international community to continue to support civil society organizations in the 
Sudan by providing technical assistance and capacity-building, especially training in human 
rights advocacy, so as to enable them to operate more effectively, and paralegal training to 
enable them to provide legal assistance to victims of human rights violations.  
</p>
<p><b>  Academic community 
</b></p>
<p>72. The academic community in the Sudan can play an important role in improving the 
human rights situation in the country, particularly in the areas of human rights education, 
promoting public awareness and providing technical assistance to the Government in the 
implementation of its 10-year national human rights action plan. Academic staff in the Law 
Faculty of the University of Khartoum and the Centre for Peace and Human Rights Studies 
at the El-Fasher University have the required expertise and have expressed their willingness 
to contribute to the enhancement of human rights education in the country.  
</p>
<p>73. The academic community in the Sudan should be continually engaged and involved 
in the strategy to improve the human rights situation in the Sudan through their objective 
academic inputs into human rights policies and strategies in the country. International 
partners have provided assistance to academic staff of the University of Khartoum to 
enhance their capabilities, which is commendable and should be sustained.  </p>


<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The Human Rights Council mandate on technical assistance and capacity-
building to the Sudan in the field of human rights has provided an appropriate 
</b></p>
<p><b>platform for the Independent Expert to engage with the Government of the Sudan on 
</b></p>
<p><b>improving the human rights situation in the country, and to assist in identifying areas 
</b></p>
<p><b>of assistance that would help the Sudan to fulfil its human rights obligations. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The Government of the Sudan has made some progress in developing policies 
and legislative and institutional mechanisms necessary for improving the human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights situation in the country. It now needs to concentrate on implementing these 
</b></p>
<p><b>policies through the adoption of a results-oriented culture that promotes the tangible 
</b></p>
<p><b>realization of the adopted human rights policies across the relevant institutions in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>country.
