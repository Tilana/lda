NEWS RELEASE, 16 AUGUST, 2016
HALF YEARLY FINANCIAL REPORT
FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
FURTHER PROGRESS ON COST REDUCTIONS AND IMPROVING MARGINS
Antofagasta plc CEO Iván Arriagada said: "A 24.7% reduction in operating costs offset the decline in the copper price and lower sales
volumes resulting in EBITDA of $571.6 million, 2.3% higher than in the same period last year.
"Continued management actions to reduce costs and preserve cash contributed to our EBITDA margin strengthening to 39.5%, from 26.2%
in the full year 2015. While reducing costs in absolute terms is important we are focused on achieving improved efficiencies in a sustainable
manner to ensure long-term shareholder value.
"Given the current economic uncertainty we are cautious in our outlook and remain conservative in our approach to managing capital. The
Board has declared a dividend of 3.1 cents per share equal to 35% of net earnings at the interim, in line with our policy to pay a minimum of
35% of full year net earnings which remains unchanged.
"At Los Pelambres, following the agreement reached with the Caimanes community in April, the two longstanding court cases relating to the
Mauro tailings dam have recently been resolved. Although an appeal is possible, it is unlikely to be accepted and Los Pelambres and the
Antofagasta group now move into a new era of community engagement."

DIRECTORS' COMMENTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
FINANCIAL
Group revenue was $1,448.0 million, 18.5% lower than in the same period last year due to lower copper prices and sales volumes, and the
closure of Michilla at the end of 2015. Revenue from the sale of by-products was similar to the same period last year as lower production
offset the increase in realised prices.
Despite the fall in revenue, EBITDA increased by 2.3% to $571.6 million reflecting a 24.7% reduction in operating costs and the inclusion of
EBITDA from Zaldívar and other associates for the first time. This has resulted in earnings per share from continuing operations for the period
of 8.9 cents per share, down 3.3% compared with the same period last year.
The Board has declared an interim ordinary dividend of 3.1 cents per share, which represents a pay-out ratio of 35%, consistent with the
Group's dividend policy.
PRODUCTION AND CASH COSTS
Group copper production in the first half of 2016 was 323,300 tonnes, 6.6% higher than in the same period last year with the inclusion of
production from Antucoya and attributable production from Zaldívar, which were not contributing to Group production in the first half of 2015.
This more than offset the loss of production following the closure of Michilla at the end of 2015.
Group gold production was 109,500 ounces in the first six months of the year, 3,000 ounces less than in the first half of 2015 as a result of
lower grades at Centinela.
Molybdenum production at Los Pelambres was 3,300 tonnes in the first half of 2016, compared with 4,700 tonnes in the first six months of
2015, principally due to lower throughput and grades
Group cash costs before by-product credits in the first half of 2016 were $1.60/lb, a $0.28/lb decrease compared with the same period last
year. This decrease was due to higher production, improved cost performance, the weaker Chilean Peso and a revised estimation of
stripping costs, which accounted for $0.10/lb of the decrease.
Net cash costs for the first half of 2016 at $1.26/lb were 17.6% lower than in the same period last year reflecting the lower cash costs before
by-product credits.
COST AND COMPETITIVENESS PROGRAMME
The Group introduced the Cost and Competitiveness Programme in 2014 with the aim of reducing the cost
base and improving the Group's competitiveness within the industry.
During the first half of 2016, the Group continued to focus on reducing its operating costs through the
Programme and achieved cost savings of approximately $67 million in mine site costs and $57 million in
corporate, exploration and evaluation expenses. The target for full year is $160 million.
The Programme focuses on four areas:
·     Services productivity: Improving productivity and quality of contracts while reducing costs
·     Operational and maintenance management: Improving performance of critical processes and implementation of standardised
maintenance management practices
·     Corporate and organisational effectiveness: Reducing costs and restructuring the Group's organisational functions
·     Energy efficiency: Optimising energy efficiencies, while achieving lower contract prices for energy
The Group is implementing changes to the support areas at each of the operations, including Finance,
Human Resources, External Affairs and Legal, with the objective of simplifying their organisation, avoiding
duplication, creating improved capability to implement best practices across the Group and focusing
operations on the core activities of sustainability (particularly safety), production and costs. At the same
time operational and maintenance processes are being strengthened at each site. This standardisation will
result in higher efficiency across the functions whilst providing the same level of service and quality across
the mining operations.
CEO SUCCESSION
As previously announced Iván Arriagada succeeded Diego Hernández as CEO of Antofagasta plc on 8 April
2016 having held the position of CEO of Antofagasta Minerals since February 2015. Since joining the Group,
Iván has led a rigorous cost reduction programme, focusing on maintaining the Group´s healthy balance
sheet while ensuring all of the Group´s operations are generating operating cash flow at current copper
prices.
CHANGE IN BASIS OF ESTIMATION OF DEFERRED STRIPPING COSTS
The Group has revised its estimation of deferred stripping costs in 2016 compared with that used in the original guidance announced in
January 2016. This change has affected Los Pelambres and the 2016 full year cash costs before by-products credits are now expected to be
$1.50/lb. The corresponding increase in capital expenditure, as mine development, for the year is expected to be $112 million, with total
forecast cash expenditure for 2016, operating and capital, remaining unchanged.
LABOUR AGREEMENTS
Negotiations are underway with employees at Antucoya and the supervisors at Los Pelambres and Zaldívar
in respect of entering into new labour agreements for two years or longer. The agreements at Antucoya and
Zaldívar will be the first term agreements under the Group's operatorship and all of the agreements are
expected to be concluded by the end of the year.
SAFETY
Regrettably there was a fatal accident at Antucoya during the period and another in the Transport Division in July. A full investigation has
now been completed at Antucoya and actions identified during the review are being implemented with direct oversight by senior
management. An investigation of the causes and lessons learned is underway at the Transport Division. The Group remains committed to
achieving zero fatalities and is continually working to strengthen and deepen the safety culture at all of the operations under the Group Safety
and Health model. The Group continues to report high-potential near misses, which is a fundamental preventative measure in improving
understanding of the key risk areas.
Since the start of the year the executive team has visited the Group's mining operations periodically as part of a safety leadership
programme, demonstrating to employees and contractors the importance of safety and empowering employees to ensure safety comes first.
Further information on the Group's effort to support and develop a safety culture within the business is set out on pages 62-64 of the 2015
Annual Report and Accounts.
TAX
During the first six months of the year the Effective Tax Rate (ETR) was 42.7%, higher than the 39.6% in the same period last year, but lower
than the full year rate of 61.8% in 2015. For the full year this year, the ETR is expected to be in the range of 40-45%, depending on realised
metal prices during the rest of the year. Under the Tax Reform Bill signed in to law in Chile, the corporate tax rate for the Group has increased
to 24% in 2016. Withholding tax on distributions remains at 35% and allows a rebate of the corporate tax paid when distributing dividends.
Mining tax (royalties) rates are also unchanged.
DEPRECIATION AND AMORTISATION
Depreciation and amortisation for the first half of 2016 was $247.3 million compared to the $245.4 million in the first half of 2015 and for the
full year it is expected to be broadly similar to 2015.
OUTLOOK
Group copper production for the full year is expected to be at the lower end of the 710-740,000 tonnes guided in January, and cash costs
before by-product credits and net cash costs are expected to be $0.05/lb lower at $1.60/lb and $1.30/lb respectively. Production for the year
is weighted to the second half with the Centinela Concentrates expansion and Antucoya reaching full capacity, and as the grade at Centinela
increases as planned.
The outlook for the short term copper market is expected to continue to be volatile as national stimulus programmes, macroeconomic events
and movements in the US dollar continue to dominate the financial markets and affect the price of copper. The market is also affected by the
weak scrap supply where refining charges for smelters are lower than concentrate TC/RCs with new supply coming from Peru and
elsewhere.
There have been few cuts in mine production so far this year reflecting the industry's continued success in reducing costs and the
strengthening of the copper price. If prices weaken towards $2.00/lb or below with conviction then supply cuts can be expected, but in the
meantime supply surpluses are forecast until at least 2018 as demand growth is forecast to remain modest. The outlook beyond 2018 looks
stronger when the market is expected to go into deficit.
During 2015 the Group consolidated and optimised its asset portfolio through sales, purchases and closures while also reducing costs. This
year the Group is focusing on completing the Antucoya ramp-up and the expansion at Centinela Concentrates while continuing to enhance
the efficiency of its operations, with particularly focus on achieving sustainable improvements in productivity. On completion of the Group's
current capital programmes, together with the restructuring of its operations, it will be well positioned to withstand continued weakness in the
copper market and to benefit from its recovery, when it comes.
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS AND PROJECTS
MINING DIVISION
LOS PELAMBRES
Operating profit
Operating profit at Los Pelambres was $338.5 million in the first half of 2016, compared with $309.8 million in the first six months of 2015.
This increase can be explained by higher sale volumes and lower operating costs, partially offset by a lower realised copper price.
Production
Copper production increased 1.6% to 172,100 tonnes in the first half of 2016 reflecting the impact of improved recoveries as throughput is
lowered to process a higher proportion of harder ore. In addition, production in the first half of 2015 was disrupted by community protests
which have since been addressed through the implementation of an improved long term community engagement plan.
Molybdenum production in the first six months of 2016 at 3,300 tonnes was 29.8% lower than last year, primarily due to lower grades and
lower throughput.
Changes in Estimation Methods of Deferred Stripping
The Group has revised its estimation of deferred stripping costs at Los Pelambres in 2016 compared with that used in the original guidance
announced in January 2016. The 2016 full year cash costs before by-products credits are now expected to be $1.50/lb. The corresponding
increase in capital expenditure, as mine development, for the year is expected to be $112 million, with total forecast cash expenditure for
2016, operating and capital, remaining unchanged.
Costs
Cash costs before by-product credits in the first half of the last year were $1.33/lb, which is $0.34/lb lower than the same period last year
($0.26/lb before the change in estimation of deferred stripping) with lower materials movement and lower input prices being the main
contributors.
Net cash costs for the first half of the year were 25.0% lower than the same period last year at $1.02/lb as a result of lower onsite costs, as
explained above, combined with higher by-product prices and favourable movements in the Chilean Peso exchange rate, offset by lower
molybdenum production.
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure, excluding mine development, in the first six months of 2016 was $43 million and for the 2016 full year is expected to be
approximately $185 million. A further $112 million will be spent on mine development, of which $52 million was spent in the first six months.
Resolution of outstanding claims relating to the Mauro tailings dam
Following recent decisions of the Supreme Court of Chile and the Court of Appeal of La Serena and an agreement reached with the
Caimanes community in April, outstanding and long-running claims relating to the Mauro tailings dam have been recently resolved.
The Mauro tailings dam began operating in 2008. Since then, there have been a series of civil claims filed by some members of the
Caimanes community seeking to stop the dam's operations. Two claims have been through various courts and stages of appeal over a
number of years: one on the grounds that the Mauro tailings dam affects the flow and quality of the Pupío stream; the other on the grounds
that the tailings dam wall would not withstand an extreme seismic event.
Although Los Pelambres has always complied with all applicable laws, regulations and controls and has successfully defended its right to
continue operating the dam, Los Pelambres has also committed to understanding and addressing the underlying concerns expressed by the
Caimanes community.
In 2015 and 2016, Los Pelambres engaged in formal and transparent dialogue process designed to allow Los Pelambres to better
understand community concerns and to share views and information about its own activities which concluded in an open consultation
process. In May 2016, Los Pelambres reached an agreement with the Caimanes community which will see Los Pelambres invest in future
water supply solutions, additional safety measures, community development projects and compensation for the Caimanes community.
Following on from this agreement, the Supreme Court has recently accepted a settlement agreement filed by Los Pelambres and the
members of the Caimanes community pursuing the claim that the dam wall would not withstand extreme seismic events with the
consequence that this longstanding claim has now been extinguished.
Additionally, the Court of Appeal of La Serena has recently accepted the plan of works put forward by Los Pelambres to ensure the operation
of the tailings dam does not affect the normal flow and quality of the Pupío stream. This decision overturns an earlier ruling from the Civil
Court in Los Vilos that was appealed by Los Pelambres, which had rejected this plan of works and ordered the demolition of the tailings dam
wall. The works performed by Los Pelambres will also include the additional works set out in the agreement reached with the Caimanes
community.
Further details on other material claims affecting Los Pelambres can be found in Note 20 to the 2016 half yearly financial report below.
CENTINELA
Operating profit
In the first six months of 2016 Centinela made an operating loss of $38.0 million, compared with a $66.3 million profit in the same period last
year. This decrease was due to revenue falling as sales volumes fell and the realised copper price dropped, offset by lower operating costs.
Sales volumes were, in part, impacted by poor weather conditions at the end of June that delayed shipments over the period end.
Production
During the first six months of the year Centinela produced 98,100 tonnes of copper, down 17.1% compared to the same period in 2015
primarily due to significantly lower production of copper cathodes.
Copper in concentrate production for the first six months of the year was 6.6% lower compared to 2015 as lower grades and lower recoveries
impacted production despite higher throughput. On completion of design improvements to the second thickener, throughput is expected to
reach the expanded capacity of 105,000 tonnes of ore per day on a peak basis during the fourth quarter. In addition, copper grades will be
over 0.60% during the second half of the year as mining moves, as planned, into a higher grade area of the pit. Throughput will run at the
new design capacity on a continuous basis once the third thickener has been completed.
Compared with the first half of last year, cathode production during 2016 was 37.8% lower as grades declined, as expected, as mining
moved to the lower grade zones of the Tesoro Central pit and throughput decreased due to restrictions in the reclamation system. The
restrictions are caused by the high moisture levels of the ore coming from the current phase of the pit and are expected to continue until the
end of the year.
Gold production for the year to date was 80,500 ounces, 10.7% lower than the first six months of 2015 with significantly lower gold grades
and lower recoveries.
Costs
For the year to date cash costs before by-product credits were 3.3% lower than in 2015 at $2.06/lb reflecting costs improvements and lower
prices of consumables such as acid and diesel.
Net cash costs for the first half of 2016 were $1.53/lb compared with $1.67/lb in the first half of 2015. This decrease is mainly due to the fall in
cash costs before by-product credits.
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure in the first six months of 2016 was $175.3 million. Capital expenditure for the 2016 full year is expected to be
approximately $430 million, which includes approximately $195 million with respect to the Encuentro Oxide project and $53 million related to
the new molybdenum plant. The development of both projects is proceeding in line with the revised schedule announced earlier this year
with completion expected in 2017. A further $265 million will be spent on mine development for the year, of which $94.6 million was spent in
the first six months of the year.
ANTUCOYA
Operating profit
For the first half of the year the operating loss at Antucoya was $0.5 million with commercial production being achieved at the beginning of
April 2016 and sales and costs being no longer capitalised from that point.
Production
Copper production at Antucoya was 27,000 tonnes as the project ramps up to full capacity of 85,000 tonnes per annum in the second half of
2016. Improvements to the dust suppression systems are now being implemented and are expected to be completed by the end of the year.
Costs
During the second quarter cash costs were $1.82/lb compared with guidance for the year given in January of $1.80/lb.
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure in the first six months of 2016 was $7.3 million and for the full year is expected to be approximately $71.4 million,
including approximately $5.8 million for the dust suppression systems.
ZALDÍVAR
Following completion of the acquisition of 50% of Zaldívar in December 2015, purchase price and other customary adjustments are now
complete and no further sums are payable to Barrick Gold Corporation. The total acquisition price paid was $950 million.
EBITDA
Attributable EBITDA at Zaldívar was $37.1 million in the first half of 2016.
Production
Copper production at Zaldívar was 26,000 tonnes on an attributable basis in the first six months of 2016. During the year there has been a
significant increase in copper recovery through the use of improved sulphide leaching, following the application of experience gained at
other Group operations.
Costs
Cash costs for the first six months of 2016 were $1.50/lb. Cost synergies have been realised at Zaldívar with the integration of the operation
into the Group's procurement practices and contracts.
Capital expenditure
Attributable capital expenditure in the first six months of 2016 was $29.8 million, of which $22.6 million related to mine development (deferred
stripping). Capital expenditure for the 2016 full year is expected to be approximately $55 million, which includes approximately $25 million
with respect to stripping.
GROWTH PROJECTS AND OPPORTUNITIES
The Group seeks to increase copper production in Chile and abroad through the development of projects and other potential opportunities.
Brownfield development within the Group's Los Pelambres and Centinela mining districts in Chile remain the primary focus for maximising
value while managing risks associated with execution.
The Group will complete several projects at Centinela over the next 18 months that will increase production while reducing unit costs. At the
same time it is advancing its two major expansion projects at Los Pelambres and Centinela to a stage that they will be ready for an
investment decision to be made on one or both of them at the end of 2017. However, these projects will only be advanced if they satisfy the
Group's evaluation criteria. The Group believes investing through the cycle in the right opportunities.
The Group's exploration and evaluation expenditure in the first six months of 2016 was $18.9 million in comparison to expenditure in the
same period last year of $56.1 million. The reduction in expenditure reflects the current prioritisation of cost management over long-term
potential growth through exploration success.
Projects under construction
Encuentro Oxides
The Encuentro Oxides deposit is within the Centinela Mining District. It is expected to produce an average of approximately 43,000 tonnes of
copper cathode per year over an eight-year period, utilising the existing capacity at Centinela's SX-EW plant. This will enable the plant to
return to its full operating capacity of 100,000 tonnes per annum for a number of years once the project is complete.
The construction budget for the project of $636 million was approved by the Board at the end of 2014. As of the end of June 2016, the project
had achieved over 68% completion (including design, engineering, procurement and construction) with first production expected in the
second half of 2017.
During the first six months of the year project expenditure was $88.8 million, bringing the total construction expenditure to $421 million.
Molybdenum Plant
During the first half of the year, the construction of the Centinela Molybdenum Plant continued with the project achieving 39% completion
(including design, engineering, procurement and construction) by the end of June 2016. Total capital costs are expected to be approximately
$125 million of which approximately $32.2 million has been incurred by 30 June 2016. Once completed by the end of 2017, the plant will
produce some 2,400 tonnes of molybdenum per year, which will contribute to a reduction in Centinela's net cash costs.
Brownfield growth projects
The Group recognises the importance of capital cost control and optimising production from existing operations, and manages this by
constantly monitoring the efficiency of its mines, plants and transport infrastructure. Where possible, it conducts debottlenecking and
incremental plant expansions to increase throughput and improve overall efficiencies. However, in current market circumstances the Group
has deferred these projects to reduce expenditure while keeping the project teams active and focusing on completion of key time-critical
feasibility study work, such as the preparation of Environmental Impact Assessments.
Los Pelambres Incremental Expansion
As previously announced the Group has split the Los Pelambres Incremental Expansion into two phases to simplify the development of the
project and to conserve development capital in light of lower commodity prices.
Phase 1
During Phase 1, Los Pelambres will operate at an average throughput of 190,000 tonnes per day through the addition of a new grinding and
flotation circuit, to mitigate the decline in throughput resulting from the higher proportion of hard ore being mined as the pit gets deeper. In
addition, the project includes a 400l/s desalination plant and water pipeline as a backup for dry seasons. Desalinated water will be pumped
to the Mauro tailing storage facility where it will connect with the water recycling circuit that returns water from the tailings facility to the Los
Pelambres processing plant.
In April 2016 the Group submitted the Environmental Impact Assessment ("EIA") for Phase 1 to the authorities to begin the formal permitting
application process for the project. This process will involve a formal dialogue between the Group and the authorities regarding the scope
and scale of the project and is expected to be completed in 2017. Once the EIA is in place and the feasibility study is completed towards the
end of 2017 the Group will decide whether to proceed with the project, with consideration for the then prevailing market conditions.
Capital expenditure for this project is estimated at approximately $1.1 billion, with some $600 million allocated to the additional mine fleet,
crushing and flotation circuits and the balance for the desalination plant and water pipeline.
Phase 2
In Phase 2, the Group will increase throughput to 205,000 tonnes per day and to extend the mine's life beyond the currently approved 22
years. During this phase, a new EIA will be submitted to increase the capacity of the mine's Mauro tailings storage facility and the mine waste
dumps.
Initial capital expenditure for this phase is estimated to be approximately $500 million, with the majority of the expenditure being on mining
equipment, further crushing and grinding capacity, and flotation cells. In addition, the conveyors from the primary crusher to the concentrator
plant will have to be repowered to support the increased throughput.
The Group is currently advancing the conceptual studies for the increase in the capacity of the tailing storage facility and the waste rock
dumps in parallel with the Phase 1 feasibility study.
Greenfield growth projects
Centinela Second Concentrator
The Group continues to evaluate options for the development of the Centinela Mining District, which is a key region for longer-term growth
containing approximately 7 billion tonnes of resources and significant options for expansion growth.
The second concentrator will be built some 7 km from Centinela's current concentrator. It is expected to have an ore throughput capacity of
approximately 90,000 tonnes per day, with annual production of approximately 140,000 tonnes of copper, 150,000 ounces of gold and 3,000
tonnes of molybdenum. It is currently planned that ore will first be sourced from the Esperanza Sur deposit and, once mining at Encuentro
Oxides is completed, ore will also be sourced from Encuentro Sulphides, which lies below the oxide deposit.
The pre-feasibility study for this $2.7 billion project was completed at the end of 2015 and the preparation of the feasibility study is currently
underway and is expected to be completed by the end of 2017. The EIA was submitted in 2015, with the outcome expected during the
second half of 2016.
During the year the Group has completed construction of a pilot test plant for a high pressure grinding roller (HPGR) system which is being
considered in preference to conventional SAG and ball mills. The preferred crushing technology will be included in the feasibility study,
which will be completed by the end of 2017. A decision to proceed with the project will only be made if it is supported by the market outlook
at the time. If approval is granted at the end of 2017, production would be expected to begin in 2021.
Los Pelambres
Los Pelambres is a world-class deposit with a resource base of more than three times the quantity of ore planned to be processed under the
current mine plan. These resources could support an expansion considerably greater than that planned under Phases 1 and 2 of the
Incremental Expansion, however, the Group's current focus remains on the nearer-term.
United States - Twin Metals
Twin Metals Minnesota LLC ("Twin Metals") is a copper, nickel and platinum group metals ("PGM") underground-mining project which holds
the Maturi, Maturi Southwest and Spruce Road copper-nickel PGM deposits in Minnesota, USA.
The pre-feasibility study on the project was completed in August 2014 and in November 2014 the Group entered into an agreement to
acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of its project partner, Duluth Metals Limited, bringing the Group's ownership in the project to
100%. The acquisition was completed in early 2015 and further optimisations of the pre-feasibility study are now being evaluated. The
permitting process is complex and is expected to take at least five years to complete with challenges expected along the way. The project
has significant copper and nickel resources and is a world-class deposit in terms of size and potential mine life.
Other exploration and evaluation activities
The Group has an early-stage exploration programme beyond its existing core Centinela and Los Pelambres mining districts. This
programme is conducted through its in-house exploration team and partnerships with third parties with the aim of building a portfolio of
longer-term opportunities mainly in Chile and the Americas, plus select regions in the rest of the world such as Australia and Zambia.
However, in the current depressed market conditions priority is being given to reducing expenditure rather than increasing resources. The
programme has therefore been significantly reduced.
The total expenditure on exploration and evaluation during the first half of 2016 was $18.9 million, 66.3% less than in the equivalent period
last year.
Chile
The Group continues with exploration activities in Chile to identify prospective targets on the main porphyry copper belts in the northern and
central regions. During the year, the Group conducted an asset rationalisation to relinquish low priority tenements and acquire new
tenements more closely aligned with the Group's target areas. Drilling continued at the Cachorro deposit south of Antucoya and the El
Encierro deposit in the third region of Chile.
International
The Group has an exploration office in Toronto to increase its exposure to exploration opportunities in a cost-effective manner. The Group's
approach is to partner with experienced junior exploration companies benefiting from their local expertise and knowledge while
complimenting that with the Group's experience in exploration and project management. Working in partnership with selected companies,
both public and private, the Group advanced projects in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Mexico and Zambia during the first half of the year,
while exiting from projects in Australia, Canada, Finland and Portugal.
Energy Opportunities
Over the last few years, the Group has acquired a series of minority interests in energy generators and projects as part of its power supply
strategy for its mining operations. The strategy has a particular focus on renewable energy generation, supporting the Group's broader aim of
increasing the sustainability of its operations and stability of its energy costs. Over the last five years the Group has invested some $575
million in power-generating assets that have a combined installed capacity of 880MW (100% basis) of which, at the end of June 2016,
349MW, were in operation. By 2020 some 80% of Los Pelambres energy requirements will be from sustainable sources.
El Arrayán
The Group has a 30% interest in Parque Eolico El Arrayán SpA ("El Arrayán"), approximately 400 km north of Santiago, which in 2014
commissioned a 115MW wind farm in northern Chile, that now supplies approximately 20% (40MW) of Los Pelambres' energy requirements
under a 20-year supply contract.
Inversiones Hornitos
The Antofagasta Railway Company ("FCAB") owns a 40% interest in Inversiones Hornitos SA ("Inversiones Hornitos"), which operates the
165MW Hornitos thermoelectric power plant in Mejillones, in Chile's Antofagasta Region. Inversiones Hornitos continues to supply Centinela
under long-term power purchase agreements ("PPAs").
Alto Maipo
Los Pelambres holds a 40% interest in the 531MW Alto Maipo run-of-river hydroelectric project which is operated by AES Gener and is in the
upper section of the Maipo river, 50 km south-east of Santiago. Construction is underway and is expected to be completed in 2019. The
Group is contributing its share of the capital cost, which is currently under review. Once completed, the Alto Maipo project will supply Los
Pelambres with up to 110MW under 20-year PPA.
Los Pelambres has also signed a 20-year PPA with AES Gener for the provision of up to 50MW of power which started in 2015 with power
coming from a coal fired power station.
Solar Energy
Los Pelambres has long-term PPAs with two solar power providers for a total of 50MW of power, approximately 25% of its total energy
requirement. The first of these PPAs came on stream in June 2015 and the second will start in the second half of 2016. These PPAs provide
Los Pelambres with secure supply of renewable energy for a 20-year period at competitive prices.
TRANSPORT DIVISION
Total transport volumes in the first half of 2016 were 3.3 million tonnes, compared to 2.9 million tonnes in the
first half of 2015, including 2.7 million tonnes of rail volumes. The 14.9% increase in volumes was driven by
the railway operation with an additional 0.3 million tonnes of concentrate production from a new mine and
the improved utilisation of the rolling stock fleet to haul an additional 0.2 million tonnes of acid and copper
cathodes. The truck operation remains focused on supporting the railway logistics chain.
Operating Costs
Transport unit costs for the first half of 2016 were $10.8/tonne compared with $14.1/tonne in the first half of
2015. This 23.4% decrease was primarily due to increased volumes and lower diesel prices.
Operating profit
The Transport Division generated $31.7 million of operating profits in the first half of 2016, 29.4% higher than
in the first six months of 2015. The increased profitability is explained by the improved transport volumes
and significantly lower operating costs.
New Operating Model
During first half of 2016 the Division implemented a new operating model based on three focus areas; sustainability (including safety and
community relations), productivity improvements and cost savings.
The model targets a balanced approach between cost savings and productivity improvements to ensure the sustainable development and
expansion of operations, particularly considering the rail division operates in the populated areas of the fast growing Antofagasta Region.
Safety
Sadly, on 23 July one of the Division's trains was involved in a road traffic accident near to the town of Sierra Gorda. A thorough investigation
is currently underway and actions have already been taken to safeguard the Division's employees and contractors. The Division remains
committed to achieving zero fatalities and the new operating model is a further step to achieve this goal.

Revenue
Group revenue in the first half of 2016 was $1,448.0 million, 18.5% below the $1,775.9 million achieved in the first half of 2015. The decrease
of $327.9 million mainly reflected a decrease in the realised copper price and lower copper sales volumes, as well as lower by-product
revenues.
Revenue from the mining division
Revenue from copper concentrate and copper cathodes
Revenue from copper concentrate and copper cathode sales decreased by $317.8 million, or 21.3%, to $1,172.0 million, compared with
$1,489.8 million in first six months of 2015. The decrease reflected the impact of lower sales volumes and lower realised prices.
(i)  Copper volumes
Copper sales volumes decrease from 290,100 tonnes in the first half of 2015 to 272,000 tonnes in this period. The decrease in sales volumes
accounted for a decrease of $101.1 million in revenue from copper concentrate and cathode sales.
(ii) Realised copper prices
The Group's average realised copper price decreased to $2.17/lb in first six months of 2016 (first six months of 2015 - $2.54/lb). The level of
decrease was lower than the reduction in the average LME copper price, which decreased to $2.13/lb from $2.69/lb in the first half of 2015,
due to a lower level of negative provisional pricing adjustments in the current period compared with the prior year. The decrease in average
realised prices led to a $218.0 million reduction in revenue from copper concentrate and cathode sales.
Realised copper prices are determined by comparing revenue (gross of tolling charges for concentrate sales) with sales volumes in the
period. Realised copper prices differ from market prices mainly because, in line with industry practice, concentrate and cathode sales
agreements generally provide for provisional pricing at the time of shipment with final pricing based on the average market price for future
periods (normally about 30 days after delivery to the customer in the case of cathode sales and up to 150 days after delivery to the customer
in the case of concentrate sales). Realised copper prices also reflect the impact of realised gain or losses of commodity derivative
instruments hedge accounted for in accordance with IAS 39 "Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurements".
Provisional pricing adjustments increased initially invoiced sales (before adjusting for tolling charges) by $21.1 million in first six months of
2016, compared with a decrease of $109.2 million in the first six months of 2015. Further details of provisional pricing adjustments are given
in Note 4 to the 2016 half yearly financial report.
In first six months of 2016 revenue also includes a gain of $0.1 million (first six months of 2015 - loss of $0.1 million), mainly relating to
commodity derivatives which matured during the year. Further details of hedging activity in the period are given in Note 4(b) to the half yearly
financial report.
(iii) Tolling charges
Tolling charges for copper concentrate decreased by $1.3 million to US$131.7 million in the first six months of 2016 from $133.0 million in
the first six months of 2015.
Tolling charges are deducted from concentrate sales in reporting revenue and hence the decrease in these charges has had a positive
impact on revenue.
Revenue from molybdenum, gold and other by-products
Revenue from by-products at Los Pelambres and Centinela relate mainly to molybdenum and gold, and a lesser extent silver. Revenue from
by-products decreased by $16.1 million or 7.6% to $195.9 million in the first half of 2016, compared with $212.0 million in the first half of
2015.
Revenue from gold in concentrate (net of tolling charges) was $124.6 million (first half of 2015 - $129.1 million), a decrease of $4.5 million,
which mainly reflected a decrease in volumes and partly offset by a higher realised price. The realised gold price was $1,288.1/oz in the first
half of 2016 compared with $1,222.1/oz in the first half of 2015, with the increase reflecting higher market prices. Gold sales volumes
decreased from 106,000 ounces in the first half of 2015 to 97,200 ounces in this period, mainly due to lower gold ore grades at Centinela.
Revenue from molybdenum (net of roasting charges) was $43.8 million (first half of 2015 - $59.7 million), a decrease of $15.9 million. The
decrease was mainly due to lower sales volumes of 3,100 tonnes (first half 2015 - 4,400 tonnes) and partly offset by increased realised price
of $7.4/lb (first half of 2015 - $7.0/lb).
Revenue from silver increased by $4.3 million to $27.5 million in the first six month of 2016 (first six months of 2015 - $23.2 million). The
increase was due to higher sales volumes of 1.7 million ounces (first half of 2015 - 1.4 million ounces) and partly offset by decreased realised
silver price of $16.1/oz (first half of 2015 - $16.5/oz).
Revenue from the transport division
Revenue from the transport division (FCAB) increased by $6.0 million or 8.1% to $80.1 million, mainly due to higher tonnages transported.
Operating costs (excluding depreciation, amortisation and disposals)
Operating costs (excluding depreciation and amortisation) amounted to $916.4 million (first half of 2015 - $1,217.2million), a decrease of
$300.8 million. This was mainly due to lower mining operational costs and reduced exploration, evaluation and corporate costs.
Operating costs (excluding depreciation and amortisation) at the mining division
Operating costs at the mining division decreased by $298.8 million to $875.3 million in the first six months of 2016, a decrease of 25.4%. Of
this decrease, $234.5 million is attributable to lower mining operational costs. As explained above, copper sales volumes decrease from
290,100 tonnes in the first half of 2015 to 272,000 tonnes in this period.
In addition, weighted average unit cash costs for the Group excluding by-product credits (which are reported as part of revenue) and tolling
charges for concentrates (which are deducted from revenue) decreased from $1.66/lb in first half of 2015 to $1.38/lb in this period.
Exploration and evaluation costs decreased by $37.2 million to $18.9 million (first half of 2015 - $56.1 million). This reflected a general
decrease in exploration activity, and in particular at the Centinela District in Chile and the Twin Metals project in the United States.
The income statement includes a charge for mine closure rehabilitation of $3.5 million (first half of 2015 - charge of $9.0 million). This mainly
reflects lower costs at Michilla and to a lesser extent Los Pelambres.
Operating costs (excluding depreciation, amortisation and disposals) at the transport division
Operating costs at the transport division decreased by $2.0 million to $41.1 million, mainly reflecting lower diesel prices.
EBITDA and operating profit from subsidiaries and joint ventures
EBITDA
EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation) from subsidiaries and joint ventures increased by $12.9 million or
2.3% to $571.6 million in the first six months of 2016 (first six months of 2014 - $558.7 million).
EBITDA includes the Group's proportional share of EBITDA from associates and joint ventures. Zaldívar contributed $37.1 million in the first
six months of 2016 (first half of 2015 - nil). Other associates and joint ventures contributed $2.9 million.
EBITDA from the Group's mining subsidiaries decreased by 6.7% from $527.7 million in the first half of 2015 to $492.6 million in this period.
As explained above, this was mainly due to the decrease in the revenues resulting from the lower realised copper price and copper volumes,
partly offset by the lower unit cash cost and lower exploration and evaluation expenses, and corporate costs.
EBITDA at the transport division increased by $8.0 million to $39.0 million in the first half of 2016, mainly reflecting the increased revenue as
explained above and lower operating costs.
Depreciation, amortisation and disposals
The depreciation, amortisation and disposals charge was marginally higher at $247.3 million (first half of 2015 - $245.4 million), with
increased depreciation at Los Pelambres and Antucoya largely offset by reduced depreciation at Centinela.
Operating profit from subsidiaries
As a result of the above factors, operating profit from subsidiaries decreased by 3.4% to $293.8 million.
Share of results from associates and joint ventures
The Group's share of results from its associates and joint ventures was a gain of $9.7 million (first half of 2015 - loss of $0.2 million). This
mainly reflects the Group's share of results from Zaldívar.
Net finance expense
Net finance expense in the first half of 2016 was $17.7 million, compared with a net finance expense of $11.2 million in the first half of
2015.

Interest income increased from $8.8 million in first six months of 2014 to $13.5 million in first six months of 2015.
Interest expense increased from $15.7 million in the first half of 2015 to $32.0 million in the first half of 2016, mainly due to the interest
expense of Antucoya, which has been expensed since the start of commercial production on 1 April 2016. Additionally, there was higher
corporate interest expense reflecting a new long-term loan of $500 million taken out during the period.
Other finance items comprised a gain of $0.8 million (first half of 2015 - loss of $4.2 million). A loss of $0.3 million (first half of 2015 - gain of
$0.1 million) has been recognised in respect of the time value element of changes in the fair value of commodity derivative options, which is
excluded from the designated hedging relationship, and is therefore recognised directly in profit or loss. Foreign exchange gains included in
finance items were $6.0 million in first half of 2016, compared with a gain of $0.2 million in first half of 2015. An expense of $4.9 million (first
half of 2015 - $4.7 million) has been recognised in relation to the unwinding of the discount on provisions.
Profit before tax
As a result of the factors set out above, profit before tax decreased by $25.3 million or 8.4% to $276.1 million in the first half of 2016
compared with $301.4 million in the first half of 2015.
Income tax expense
The tax charge in the first half of 2016 was $118.0 million (first half of 2015 - $117.8 million) and the effective tax rate was 42.7% (first half of
2015 - 39.6%).

The effective rate of corporate tax was 29.8% compared to the statutory tax rate of 24.0%. The difference was principally due to tax losses
which under Chilean tax carry-back rules generated a credit at historic tax rates below the current year statutory rate (impact of $11.8 million /
4.3%) and the effect of expenses not deductible for Chilean corporate tax purposes (principally the funding of expenses outside of Chile)
(impact of $8.7 million / 3.1). In addition, the overall effective tax rate reflects the Chilean mining royalty charge of $32.8 million and a
withholding tax charge of $8.3 million. Further details are given in Note 7 of the 2016 half yearly financial report.
Profit from discontinued operations
On 2 June 2015 the Group completed the disposal of the water division and the resulting profit of $615.0 million has been reflected as a profit
from discontinued operations in the prior year comparative figures.
Non-controlling interests
Profit for the first half of the year attributable to non-controlling interests was $70.0 million, compared with $93.2 million in the first half of
2015, reflecting the lower profit attributable to the non-controlling interests as a consequence of the decrease in the earnings of the mining
operations analysed above.

Earnings per share calculations are based on 985,856,695 ordinary shares.  As a result of the factors set out above, profit from continuing
operations in the first half of 2016 attributable to equity shareholders of the Company was $88.1 million compared with $90.8 million in the
first half of 2015. Accordingly, earnings per share from continuing operations were 8.9 cents in the first half of 2016 compared with 9.2 cents
in first half of 2015, a decrease of 3.3%. Including the earnings from discontinued operations, total earnings per share from continuing and
discontinued operations in the first half of 2015 were 71.6 cents.

The Board determines the appropriate dividend each year based on consideration of the Group's cash balance, the level of free cash flow
and earnings generated during the year and significant known or expected funding commitments. It is expected that the total annual dividend
for each year would represent a payout ratio based on net earnings for that year of at least 35%.
The Board has declared an interim dividend for the first half of 2016 of 3.1 cents per ordinary share, which amounts to $30.6 million and will
be paid on 30 September 2016 to shareholders on the Register at the close of business on 9 September 2016.
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure decreased by $87.0 million from $595.9 million in the first half of 2015 to $508.9 million in the period. This was mainly
due to decreased construction costs at Antucoya which is now in operation and the Encuentro Oxides project, partly offset by increased
expenditure in respect of Los Pelambres, relating mainly to capitalised stripping costs. NB: capital expenditure figures quoted in other
sections of this report are on a cash flow basis, unless stated otherwise.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group periodically uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to commodity price movements. At 30 June 2016 the Group
had entered into min/max contracts at Centinela for a notional amount of 12,000 tonnes of copper production covering a period up to 31
December 2016, with an average minimum price of $2.11/lb and an average maximum price of $2.69/lb. The Group also periodically uses
interest rate swaps to swap the floating rate interest for fixed rate interest. At 30 June 2016 the Group had entered into contracts at Centinela
for a maximum notional amount of $105 million at a weighted average fixed rate of 3.372 % fully maturing in August 2018. The Group had
also entered into contracts in relation to a financing loan at the FCAB for a maximum notional amount of $120 million at weighted average
fixed rate of 1.634% fully maturing in August 2019.

Cash flows from continuing and discontinued operations were $774.1 million in the first half of 2016 compared with $807.7 million in the first
half of 2015. This reflected EBITDA from subsidiaries for the period of $531.6 million[1] (first half of 2015 - $558.7 million) adjusted for a net
working capital decrease of $242.5 million (first half of 2015 - decrease of $226.4 million).
Cash tax payments in the first half of 2016 year were $257.5 million (first half of 2015 - $191.2 million), comprising corporate tax of $255.3
million (first half of 2015 - $165.6 million), mining tax of $2.2 million (first half of 2015 - $11.7 million) and withholding tax of $12.9 million (first
half of 2015 - $12.9 million). These amounts differ from the current tax charge in the consolidated income statement of $118.0 million (first
half of 2015 - $117.8 million) mainly because cash tax payments for corporate tax and the mining tax partly comprise the settlement of
outstanding balances in respect of the previous year's tax charge and payments on account for the current year based on the prior year profit
levels.
At 30 June 2015 the disposal of subsidiary amount of $947.3 million related to the disposal of Aguas de Antofagasta S.A., which carried out
of the Group's water operations.
Contributions and loans to associates and joint ventures of $1.0 million relates to the Group's share of the funding of the costs of Energia
Andina.
Cash disbursements relating to capital expenditure in the first half of 2016 were $385.4 million compared with $662.3 million in the first half of
2015. This included expenditure of $7.3 million at Antucoya (first half of 2015 - $175.4 million), $262.1 million relating to Centinela (first half
of 2015 - $233.6 million) and $94.4 million relating to Los Pelambres (first half of 2015 - $101.8 million).
At 30 June 2015 dividends paid to ordinary shareholders of the Company were $96.6 million, which related to the payment of the final
dividend declared in respect of the previous year.
Dividends paid by subsidiaries to non-controlling shareholders were $40 million (first half of 2015 - nil).

million). Excluding the non-controlling interest share in each partly-owned operation, the Group's attributable share of cash, cash equivalents
and liquid investments was $1,801.8 million (30 June 2014 - $2,785.0 million).
New borrowings in the first half of 2016 were $656.8 million (first half of 2015 - $357.3 million), including new short-term borrowings at Los
Pelambres of $160.0 million and new long-term borrowings at Corporate of $496.8 million. Repayments of borrowings and finance leasing

Total Group borrowings at 30 June 2016 were $3,219.7 million (at 30 June 2015 - $2,479.4 million). Of this, $2,410.1 million (at 30 June 2015
- $1,754.8 million) is proportionally attributable to the Group after excluding the non-controlling interest shareholdings in partly-owned
operations.
Going concern
The Group's business activities, together with those factors likely to affect its future performance, are set out in the Review of Operations.
Details of the cash flows of the Group during the period, along with its financial position at the period-end are set out in this Financial Review.
The half yearly financial report includes details of the Group's cash, cash equivalent and liquid investment balances in Note 19, and details
of borrowings are set out in Note 15. When assessing the going concern status of the Group the Directors have considered in particular its
financial position, including its significant balance of cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments and the borrowing facilities in place,
including their terms and remaining durations. When assessing the prospects of the Group, the Directors have considered the Group's
copper price forecasts, the Group's expected production levels, operating cost profile, capital expenditure and financing plans. The Directors
have taken into consideration the Group's key risks which could impact the prospects of the Group, with the most relevant to this assessment
considered to be risks to the copper price outlook. Robust down-side sensitivity analyses have been performed, assessing the impact of a
significant deterioration in the copper price outlook. These stress-tests all indicated results which could be managed in the normal course of
business. Based on their assessment of the Group's prospects and viability, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
Having reassessed the principal risks, the Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing its
condensed interim financial statements.
Principal risks and uncertainties
There are a number of potential risks and uncertainties which could have a material impact on the Group's performance over the remaining
six months of the financial year and could cause actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. The Directors do not
consider that the principal risks and uncertainties have changed since the publication of the annual report for the year ended 31 December
2015. A detailed explanation of the risks summarised below can be found in the Risk Management section of that annual report which is
available at www.antofagasta.co.uk. Key headline risks relate to the following:
·     Community relations
·     Strategic resources
·     Operational risks
·     Projects management
·     Political, legal and regulatory risks
·     Health and safety
·     Environmental management
·     Growth opportunities
·     Commodity prices
·     Foreign currency exchange
·     Identification of new mineral resources
·     Ore reserves and mineral resources estimates
·     Talent management and labour relations
Cautionary statement about forward-looking statements
This half yearly financial report contains certain forward-looking statements. All statements other than historical facts are forward-looking
statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include those regarding the Group's strategy, plans, objectives or future operating or
financial performance, reserve and resource estimates, commodity demand and trends in commodity prices, growth opportunities, and any
assumptions underlying or relating to any of the foregoing. Words such as "intend", "aim", "project", "anticipate", "estimate", "plan", "believe",
"expect", "may", "should", "will", "continue" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that are beyond the Group's
control. Given these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, actual results could differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by
these forward-looking statements, which speak only as at the date of this report. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ from
those in the forward-looking statements include: global economic conditions, demand, supply and prices for copper and other long-term
commodity price assumptions (as they materially affect the timing and feasibility of future projects and developments), trends in the copper
mining industry and conditions of the international copper markets, the effect of currency exchange rates on commodity prices and operating
costs, the availability and costs associated with mining inputs and labour, operating or technical difficulties in connection with mining or
development activities, employee relations, litigation, and actions and activities of governmental authorities, including changes in laws,
regulations or taxation. Except as required by applicable law, rule or regulation, the Group does not undertake any obligation to publicly
update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Past performance cannot be relied on as a guide to future performance.

Notes
1.   General information and accounting policies
a)             General information
These June 2016 interim condensed consolidated financial statements ("the condensed financial statements") are for the six months ended
30 June 2016.  The condensed financial statements are unaudited.
The information for the year ended 31 December 2015 does not constitute the Group's statutory accounts as defined in section 434 of the
Companies Act 2006 (the "Act") but is derived from those accounts. The statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015 have been
approved by the Board and have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The auditor has reported on those accounts and their report
was unqualified, with no matters by way of emphasis, and did not contain statements under section 498(2) of the Act (regarding adequacy of
accounting records and returns) or under section 498(3) (regarding provision of necessary information and explanations).
b)             Significant events during 2016
The Antucoya operation achieved commercial production in 1 April 2016, and its revenue and costs have accordingly been recognised in the
income statement from that date onwards.
c)             Basis of preparation
The annual financial statements of Antofagasta plc for the year ended 31 December 2015 were prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") and with those parts of the companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. For
these purposes, IFRS comprise the standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") and IFRS Interpretations
Committee ("IFRIC IC") that have been endorsed by the European Union ("EU").
The condensed set of financial statements included in this half-yearly financial report has been prepared in accordance with the accounting
policies for the year ended 31 December 2015 and the International Accounting Standard ("IAS") 34 Interim Financial Reporting and the
requirements of the UK Disclosure and Transparency Rules ("DTR") of the Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") in the United Kingdom as
applicable to interim financial reporting.
The condensed financial statements represent a "condensed set of financial statements" as referred to in the DTR issued by the FCA.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information required for a full annual financial report and are to be read in conjunction with the
Group's financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.
d)             Change in estimation
The Group has revised its estimation of deferred stripping costs which has impacted the amounts capitalised at the Los Pelambres mine
during the first six months of 2016, where $61 million of deferred stripping costs have been capitalised during the period.
e)             Going concern
When assessing the going concern status of the Group the Directors have considered in particular its financial position, including its
significant balance of cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments and the borrowing facilities in place, including their terms and remaining
durations. When assessing the prospects of the Group, the Directors have considered the Group's copper price forecasts, the Group's
expected production levels, operating cost profile, capital expenditure and financing plans. The Directors have taken into consideration the
Group's key risks which could impact the prospects of the Group, with the most relevant to this assessment considered to be risks to the
copper price outlook. Robust down-side sensitivity analyses have been performed, assessing the impact of a significant deterioration in the
copper price outlook. These stress-tests all indicated results which could be managed in the normal course of business. Based on their
assessment of the Group's prospects and viability, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources to
continue in operational existence for at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements. Having reassessed the
principal risks, the Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing its condensed interim
financial statements.
f)             Adoption of new accounting standards
The following accounting standards, amendments and interpretations became effective in the current reporting period:
·      IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts
·      IAS 19 Defined Benefit Plans, Employee Contributions (Amendments to IAS 19)
·      Annual improvements 2010 - 2012 Cycle - improvements to six IFRSs
·      Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations (Amendments to IFRS 11)
·      Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation (Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38)
·      Agriculture: Bearer Plants (Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41)
·      Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements (Amendments to IAS 27)
·      Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture (Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28)
·      Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception (Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28)
·      Disclosure Initiative (Amendments to IAS 1)
The application of these standards and interpretations effective for the first time in the current period has had no significant impact on the
amounts reported in these condensed consolidated financial statements.

3.   Segmental analysis
The Group's reportable segments are as follows:
·        Los Pelambres
·        Centinela
·        Michilla
·        Antucoya
·        Zaldivar
·        Exploration and evaluation
·        Railway and other transport services
·        Water concession
·        Corporate and other items
For management purposes, the Group is organised into three business divisions based on their products - Mining, Railway and Other
Transport Services and the Water concession. The mining division is split further for management reporting purposes to show results by
mine and exploration activity. Los Pelambres, Centinela and Antucoya are operating mines, Michilla was placed on care and maintenance at
the end of 2015, Zaldivar, in which the Group has acquired a 50% stake, was acquired in December 2015. Los Pelambres produces primarily
copper concentrate and molybdenum as a by-product. Centinela produces primarily copper concentrate containing gold as a by-product and
copper cathodes. Michilla, Antucoya and Zaldivar produce copper cathodes. The transport division provides rail cargo (based in Chile and
formerly Bolivia) and road cargo (based in Chile) together with a number of ancillary services (based in Chile). The water division produced
and distributed potable water to domestic customers and untreated water to industrial customers in Chile's Antofagasta Region, this segment
had been disposed of during H1 2015. The Exploration and evaluation segment incurs exploration and evaluation expenses. "Corporate and
other items" comprises costs incurred by the Company, Antofagasta Minerals S.A., the Group's mining corporate centre and other entities,
that are not allocated to any individual business segment. Consistent with its internal management reporting, the Group's corporate and other
items are included within the mining division.
Management monitors the operating results of business segments separately for the purpose of making decisions about resources to be
allocated and of assessing performance. Segment performance is evaluated based on the operating profit and EBITDA of each of the
segments.
Zaldivar, in which the Group has acquired 50% stake in December 2015, has been included as new segment in 2016.

4.   Revenue
Copper and molybdenum concentrate sale agreements and copper cathode sale agreements generally provide for provisional pricing of
sales at the time of shipment, with final pricing being based on the monthly average London Metal Exchange copper price or monthly
average molybdenum price for specified future periods. This normally ranges from one to five months after shipment to the customer.  The
provisional pricing mechanism within the sale agreements is an embedded derivative under IFRS. Gains and losses from the marking-to-
market of open sales are recognised through adjustments to revenue in the income statement and to trade debtors in the balance sheet. The
Group determines mark-to-market prices using forward prices at each period end for copper concentrate and cathode sales, and period-end
month average prices for molybdenum concentrate sales due to the absence of a futures market in the market price references for that
commodity in the majority of the Group's contracts.
In addition to mark-to-market and final pricing adjustments, revenue also includes realised gains and losses relating to derivative commodity
instruments. Details of these realised gains or losses are shown in the tables below. Further details of derivative commodity instruments in
place at the period end are given in Note 6.
Copper and molybdenum concentrate sales are stated net of deductions for tolling charges, as shown in the tables below.

Recurring fair value measurements are those that are required in the balance sheet at the end of each reporting period.
Non-recurring fair value measurements are those that are required in particular circumstances e.g. when the recoverable amount of an asset
is determined to be fair value less cost to sell according to IAS 36 Impairment of assets. There were no non-recurring fair value
measurements in the six months ending 30 June 2016.
Derivatives in designated hedge accounting relationships are valued using a discounted cash flow analysis valuation model, which includes
observable credit spreads and using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments for non-optional derivatives, and option
pricing models for optional derivatives. These are level 2 inputs as described below.
Available-for-sale investments are investments in shares on active markets and are valued using unadjusted quoted market values of the
shares at the financial reporting date. These are level 1 inputs as described below.
Provisionally priced metal sales for the period are marked-to-market at the end of the period. Gains and losses from the marking-to-market of
open sales are recognised through adjustments to revenue in the income statement and trade debtors in the balance sheet. Forward prices
at the end of the period are used for copper sales while period-end average prices are used for molybdenum concentrate sales. These are
level 2 inputs as described below.
Financial assets measured at fair value through profit and loss are highly liquid current asset investments that are valued using market prices
at the period end. These are level 1 inputs as described below.
The inputs to the valuation techniques described above are categorised into three levels, giving the highest priority to unadjusted quoted
prices in active markets (level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 inputs):
-     Level 1 fair value measurement inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
-     Level 2 fair value measurement inputs are derived from inputs other than quoted market prices included in level 1 that are observable for
the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
-     Level 3 fair value measurement inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The degree to which inputs into the valuation techniques used to measure the financial assets and liabilities are observable and the
significance of these inputs in the valuation are considered in determining whether any transfers between levels have occurred. In the six
months ending 30 June 2016 and 30 June 2015, there were no transfers between levels in the hierarchy.
b)             Embedded derivatives
As explained in Note 5, copper and molybdenum concentrate sale agreements and copper cathode sale agreements generally provide for
provisional pricing of sales at the time of shipment, with final pricing being based on the monthly average London Metal Exchange copper
price or monthly average molybdenum price for specified future periods. The provisional pricing mechanism within the sale agreements is an
embedded derivative under IFRS. Details of the provisional pricing arrangements are included in Note 5.
c)             Derivative financial instruments
The Group periodically uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate
movements.  The Group does not use such derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes.
The Group has applied the hedge accounting provisions of IAS 39 "Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement".  Changes in the
fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows have been recognised directly in
other comprehensive income, with such amounts subsequently recognised in the income statement in the period when the hedged item has
been recognised in the income statement within revenue. The time value element of changes in the fair value of derivative options is
excluded from the designated hedging relationship, and is therefore recognised directly in the income statement within other finance items.
(i)            Mark-to-market adjustments and income statement impact
The balance sheet mark-to-market adjustments in respect of derivatives at the end of each period, and the total effect on the income
statement and reserves for each period are as follows. The impact on reserves is shown before tax and non-controlling interests.

The rate of first category (i.e. corporate) tax in Chile is currently 24% (six months ended 30 June 2015 - 22.5%; year ended 31 December
2015 - 22.5%).
In addition to first category tax and the mining tax, the Group incurs withholding taxes on any remittance of profits from Chile. Withholding tax
is levied on remittances of profits from Chile at 35% less first category (i.e. corporation) tax already paid in respect of the profits to which the
remittances relate.
On 29 September 2014 a significant reform of the Chilean system was enacted into law. This introduced two alternative future taxation
systems - the partially-integrated system (the default system for the Group's Chilean subsidiaries) or the attributable system. The Group has
been accounting for deferred tax on the basis that it would apply the default partially-integrated system. On 1 February 2016 a Simplification
of the Tax Reform was enacted into law. This specifies that for entities such as the Group's Chilean subsidiaries, whose members are
corporate entities and not individual persons, only the partially-integrated system can be applied. Given that the Group has already been
accounting for deferred tax on the basis that it would apply the default partially-integrated system this has not resulted in any accounting
impact for the Group.
Under the partially-integrated system the corporate tax rate will be 25.5% in 2017 and 27% from 2018 onwards. The immediate shareholders
of the Chilean subsidiaries will pay withholding tax based on the cash distributions made by those subsidiary companies, as with the current
tax system. If the subsidiary company's shareholders are tax resident in countries with applicable tax treaties with Chile (as is the case for the
Group) the withholding tax will be 35%, less first category tax at the rate it was paid, so if the company distributes all of its earnings the total
corporate and withholding tax burden will be 35%.
The Group's mining operations are also subject to a mining tax (royalty). Production from Los Pelambres, El Tesoro Central and Mirador pits
at Centinela cathodes, Antucoya and Michilla are currently subject to a rate of 4% of taxable operating profit and Centinela concentrates of
5%, and production from El Tesoro North East pit and the run-of-mine processing at Centinela cathodes is subject to a rate of between 5-
14%, depending on the level of operating profit margin.

The tax charge for 2016 was $118.0 million and the effective tax rate was 42.7 %. In 2016 the effective tax rate varied from the statutory rate
principally due to tax losses which under Chilean tax carry-back rules generated a credit at historic tax rates below the current year statutory
rate (impact of $11.8 million / 4.3%), the effect of expenses not deductible for Chilean corporate tax purposes (principally the funding of
expenses outside of Chile) (impact of $8.7 million / 3.1 %)  and the mining tax (impact of $32.8 million / 11.8 %) and withholding tax charge
(impact of $8.3 million / 3.0%).
There are no significant tax uncertainties which would require critical judgements, estimates or potential provisions.
8.   Discontinued operations
(i)     On 24 April 2015 the Group entered into a sale agreement to dispose of Aguas de Antofagasta S.A. ("ADASA"), which carried out of the
group´s water operations. The disposal was completed on 2 June 2015. On 28 August 2015, the Group disposed of its 100% interest in
Empresa Ferroviaria Andina S.A. ("FCA").The results of ADASA and FCA for the period prior to disposal as well as the profit on disposal

Basic and diluted earnings per share is calculated on profit after tax and non-controlling interests giving net earnings of $88.1 million (six
months ended 30 June 2015 - $705.8 million, year ended 31 December 2015 - $608.2 million) and amounted to 8.9 cents and based on
985,856,695 ordinary shares.  There was no potential dilution of ordinary shares in any period.
10. Dividends
The Board has declared an interim dividend of 3.1 cents per ordinary share for the 2016 half year (2015 half year - 3.1 cents).  Dividends are
declared and paid gross. Dividends actually paid in the period and recognised as a deduction from net equity under IFRS were nil per
ordinary share (2015 half year - 9.8 cents), representing the final dividend declared in respect of the previous year.
The interim dividend will be paid on 30 September 2016 to ordinary shareholders that are on the register at the close of business on 9
September 2016.  Shareholders can elect (on or before 12 September 2016) to receive this interim dividend in US Dollars, Pounds Sterling
or Euro, and the exchange rate to be applied to interim dividends to be paid in Pounds Sterling or Euro will be set as soon as reasonably
practicable after that date (which is currently anticipated to be on 15 September 2016).  Further details of the currency election timing and
process (including the default currency of payment) are available on the Antofagasta plc website (www.antofagasta.co.uk) or from the
Company's registrar, Computershare Investor Services PLC on +44 870 702 0159.

In January 2015 the Group completed its acquisition of 100% of Duluth Metals Limited ("Duluth"). The principal asset of Duluth was its 60%
stake in Twin Metals Minnesota Limited ("Twin Metals"), a company in which the Group held the remaining 40% stake as at December 2014.
This transaction has resulted in the Group consolidating 100% of the assets and liabilities relating to Twin Metals with effect from January
2015, including the above $150.1 million intangible asset reflecting the value of Twin Metals' mining property assets. The mining properties
acquired will be amortised once production commences.
The prior year opening balance of $118.6 related to Aguas de Antofagasta S.A.'s ("ADASA") 30 year concession to operate the water rights
and facilities in the Antofagasta Region of Chile. This balance was disposed of as part of the sale of ADASA on 2 June 2015, as disclosed in
Note 8.

At 30 June 2016 $46.8 million (30 June 2015 - $40.4 million; 31 December 2015 - $44.9 million) of depreciation in respect of assets relating
to Los Pelambres, Centinela, Antucoya and Michilla has been capitalised within property, plant and equipment or inventories, and
accordingly is excluded from the depreciation charge recorded in the income statement as shown in Note 3(a).
At 30 June 2016 the Group had entered into contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment amounting to
$975.1 million (30 June 2015 - $401.7 million; 31 December 2015 - $283.1 million).
There have been no indicators of potential impairments during the first six months of 2016, and accordingly no impairment reviews have
been performed as at 30 June 2016. The Group performed impairment reviews in respect of the Centinela and Antucoya operations at the
2015 year-end. For both Centinela and Antucoya the recoverable amount indicated by the review was greater than the carrying value of the
assets, and accordingly no impairment charge was recognised. The following sensitivities in respect of the valuation estimates of Centinela
and Antucoya are still considered relevant to the assets as at 30 June 2016. The assumptions used in the impairment review calculations
which were considered to be subject to the most estimation uncertainty were the long-term copper price and the discount rate. To illustrate
the sensitivity of the valuations of Centinela and Antucoya to negative movements in these parameters, a 5% decrease in the forecast long-
term copper price would have resulted in an impairment of $375 million at Centinela and an impairment of $95 million at Antucoya, and an
increase in the discount rate from 8% to 9% would have resulted in an impairment of $190 million at Centinela and an impairment of $50
million at Antucoya. These are simple sensitivities, looking at illustrative movements in the long-term copper price and discount rate in
insolation. In reality, a deterioration in the long-term copper price environment is likely to result in corresponding improvements in a range of
input cost factors, as well as potential operational changes, which could partly mitigate the above estimated potential impairment charges.

Available-for-sale investments represent those investments which are not subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures and are not held for
trading purposes. The fair value of all equity investments are based on quoted market prices.
The reclassification of $9.4 million is related with the acquisition of Duluth Metals Limited ("Duluth"). As at 31 December 2014 the Group held
17.2% of Duluth's share capital, with a fair value of $9.4 million, accounted for as an available for sale investment. As explained in Note 14,
in January 2015 the Group completed its acquisition of 100% of Duluth. Duluth holds a 60% stake in Twin Metals Minnesota Limited ("Twin
Metals"), a company in which the Group held a 40% stake as at December 2014. Accordingly, as a consequence of the acquisition of Duluth
the Group has a 100% interest in Duluth and as a result of this a 100% interest in Twin Metals. From January 2015 Twin Metals has therefore
been consolidated as a 100% subsidiary of the Group, with this $9.4 million balance forming part of the total consideration reflected in the
accounting for the acquisition of the subsidiary.
14. Acquisition of 50% stake in Zaldívar
On 1 December 2015 Antofagasta completed its acquisition of a 50% stake in Compañia Minera Zaldívar SpA ("Zaldivar") from Barrick Gold
Corporation ("Barrick"), pursuant to an agreement entered into on 30 July 2015. As a result, Antofagasta has become operator of the Zaldivar
mine. Zaldivar is an open-pit, heap-leach copper mine located in Northern Chile, which produces approximately 100,000 tonnes of copper
cathodes annually.
Given that Antofagasta and Barrick have joint control over Zaldivar, Antofagasta is accounting for its 50% stake in Zaldivar as a joint venture,
using the equity method of accounting.
Total preliminary consideration for the transaction was $1,005.0 million in cash, subject to adjustments based on the net debt and working
capital levels of Zaldivar at the completion date. The net debt and working capital adjustments were finalised in August 2016 and resulted in
a final adjusted consideration of $949.7 million. Including capitalised acquisition costs of $7.0 million the initial investment in joint venture
balance is therefore $956.7 million. The allocation of the fair values of the individual assets and liabilities effectively contained within the
overall investment in joint venture balance will be completed within 12 months of the acquisition date.

At 30 June 2016 $100.7 million (30 June 2015 - $48.0 million; 31 December 2015 - $30.5 million) of the borrowings has fixed rate interest
and $3,119.1 million (30 June 2015 - $2,428.4 million; 31 December 2015 - $2,724.6 million) has floating rate interest. The Group
periodically enters into interest rate derivative contracts to manage its exposure to interest rates. As explained in Note 5, these include
interest rate swaps which have the effect of converting $225.0 million of floating rate borrowings into fixed rate borrowings. Details of any
derivative instruments held by the Group are given in Note 5(c).

20. Litigation and Contingent liabilities
Antofagasta plc or its subsidiaries are subject to various claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. No provision has been made
in the financial statements and none of these claims are currently expected to result in any material loss to the Group. Details of the principal
claims in existence either during, or at the end of, the period and the current status of these claims are set out below:
Los Pelambres - Mauro tailings dam
Two civil claims filed by some members of the Caimanes community (which is located near the Mauro tailings dam) seeking to stop the
operation of the dam have been ongoing for a number of years.
Following the agreement reached between Los Pelambres and the Caimanes community in April, one of these claims - a claim in which the
plaintiffs sought demolition of the dam wall on the basis of the risk that its collapse would pose to the community - was finally settled before
the Supreme Court in August.
In the second claim, the plaintiffs had argued that the tailings dam affected their alleged water rights and the environment. This allegation
was based on assertions that the dam interfered with the flow and quality of the water in the Pupío stream, a stream that passes through the
valley in which the dam is built down to the Caimanes community. This claim was rejected by the trial Court of Los Vilos in a judgement
issued in November 2012, which was then affirmed by the Court of Appeals of La Serena in August 2013. In October 2014, the Supreme
Court, by a 3-2 majority decision, upheld the appeal and ordered Los Pelambres to submit back to the trial Court of Los Vilos, within one
month, an implementation plan for works that would ensure that the operation of the dam did not affect the normal flow and quality of the
waters of the Pupío stream. That Court decided that the plan submitted by Los Pelambres was not sufficient to address the requirements of
the Supreme Court order, and that as a consequence Los Pelambres must demolish part, or all, of the tailings dam wall. Los Pelambres
appealed the Court's decision and in December 2015 the Court of Appeals ordered that, before it issues its decision, a Court appointed
engineer must review the plan submitted by Los Pelambres and issue a report explaining whether or not the proposed works are enough to
ensure that the flow of the Pupío stream to the Caimanes community is not altered by the operation of the tailings dam and, if the proposed
works are not deemed to be sufficient to achieve this purpose, what additional or other works must be performed by Los Pelambres to
achieve this goal. This report was submitted in June 2016 and confirmed that the proposed works are sufficient to comply with the decision of
the Supreme Court. The Court of Appeal issued its final decision earlier in August 2016 accepting the plan of works. Los Pelambres has six
months to submit the final details of the work plan to the Court, including the additional works set out in the agreement reached with the
Caimanes community. It remains probable that the claimants in this case will seek leave from the Supreme Court of Chile to appeal this
decision, however the Supreme Court will need to determine whether or not to accept that appeal in light of the surrounding circumstances
and only if the appeal were accepted, would the Supreme Court be required to consider anything more substantive. Taking into account the
agreement between Los Pelambres and the Caimanes community and the report issued by the independent expert appointed by the Court of
Appeal of La Serena, Los Pelambres does not expect there to be a successful appeal in this case.
Los Pelambres - Cerro Amarillo Waste Dump
In 2004, Los Pelambres received all of the required authorisations from the Chilean government to deposit waste-rock from its mining
activities in its current location (the "Cerro Amarillo Waste Dump"). According to the then official Chilean maps (1996), this area was located
entirely within Chile. In 2007, Chile modified the official maps in this area without making the changes public.
In February 2012, a binational border commission, established to clarify the exact position of the Chile/Argentina border, determined
accurately the location of the border in the area of the Cerro Amarillo Waste Dump, showing that part of the Cerro Amarillo Waste Dump was
located in Argentina.
In May 2014, Xstrata Pachón S.A. ("Xstrata Pachón"), a subsidiary of Glencore plc and the holder of the mining properties on the Argentinian
side of the border, filed a claim against Los Pelambres before the Federal Court of San Juan, Argentina, alleging that Los Pelambres had
unlawfully deposited waste-rock on its property.
Xstrata Pachón has also filed a criminal complaint before a different Federal Court of San Juan alleging that when Los Pelambres was
depositing rock on the Cerro Amarillo Waste Dump it violated several Argentinian laws relating to the misappropriation of land, unlawful
appropriation of water bodies and that people's health was in jeopardy from the alleged contamination that the Cerro Amarillo Waste Dump
might generate.
In both cases, Los Pelambres has submitted preliminary objections to the Argentinian courts.
In the civil case, a final decision on these preliminary objections is still pending and substantive arguments will not be made until and unless
these preliminary objections are finally rejected.
In the meantime, and in accordance with a preliminary measure required by the Federal Court of San Juan, Los Pelambres and the Province
of San Juan executed an agreement in April 2016 by means of which Los Pelambres has committed itself to perform a preventative process
to isolate any environmental impacts of the Cerro Amarillo Waste Dump, regularly monitor underground and surface waters, and undertake
other additional actions requested by the Province.
In the criminal proceedings, in March 2016, the Federal Court of Appeals of Mendoza held that the Argentinian courts had jurisdiction to hear
this matter and MLP has taken steps to appeal this decision.
Los Pelambres will exercise all available legal avenues to defend its position and will continue to take steps to implement the environmental
isolation of the Cerro Amarillo Waste Dump in accordance with the agreement reached with the Province of San Juan and the requirements
of the Federal Court of San Juan.

Independent review report to Antofagasta plc
Report on the interim condensed consolidated financial statements
Our conclusion
We have reviewed Antofagasta plc's interim condensed consolidated financial statements (the "interim financial statements") in the half
yearly financial report of Antofagasta plc for the 6 month period ended 30 June 2016. Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention
that causes us to believe that the interim financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with International
Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting', as adopted by the European Union and the Disclosure Rules and Transparency
Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority.
What we have reviewed
The interim financial statements comprise:
the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 30 June 2016;
the Condensed Consolidated Income Statement and Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the period then
ended;
the Condensed Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for the period then ended;
the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the period then ended; and
the explanatory notes to the interim financial statements.
The interim financial statements included in the half yearly financial report have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting
Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting', as adopted by the European Union and the Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules of the
United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority.
As disclosed in note 1 to the interim financial statements, the financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the full
annual financial statements of the Group is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union.
Responsibilities for the interim financial statements and the review
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
The half yearly financial report, including the interim financial statements, is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors.
The directors are responsible for preparing the half yearly financial report in accordance with the Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules
of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority.
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim financial statements in the half yearly financial report based on our review. This
report, including the conclusion, has been prepared for and only for the company for the purpose of complying with the Disclosure Rules and
Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority and for no other purpose.  We do not, in giving this conclusion,
accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What a review of interim financial statements involves
We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410, 'Review of Interim
Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity' issued by the Auditing Practices Board for use in the United
Kingdom. A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting
matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures.
A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) and,
consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an
audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
We have read the other information contained in the half yearly financial report and considered whether it contains any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the interim financial statements.

Notes to the production and sales statistics
(i)            For the Group's subsidiaries the production and sales figures reflect the total amounts produced and sold by the mine, not the
Group's share of each mine.  The Group owns 60% of Los Pelambres, 70% of Centinela, 70% of Antucoya and 99.9% of Michilla. For the
Zaldivar joint venture the production and sales figures reflect the Group's proportional 50% share.
(ii)          Los Pelambres produces copper and molybdenum concentrates, Centinela produces copper concentrate and copper cathodes and
Antucoya, Michilla and Zaldivar produce copper cathodes. The figures for Los Pelambres and Centinela are expressed in terms of payable
metal contained in concentrate and in cathodes. Los Pelambres and Centinela are also credited for the gold and silver contained in the
copper concentrate sold. Antucoya, Michilla and Zaldivar produce cathodes with no by-products.
(iii)         Cash costs are a measure of the cost of operational production expressed in terms of cents per pound of payable copper produced.
Cash costs are stated net of by-product credits and include tolling charges for concentrates at Los Pelambres and Centinela.  Cash costs
exclude depreciation, financial income and expenses, hedging gains and losses, exchange gains and losses and corporate tax for all four
operations.
(iv)          Realised copper prices are determined by comparing revenue from copper sales (grossing up for tolling charges for concentrates)
with sales volumes for each mine in the period. Realised molybdenum and gold prices are calculated on a similar basis. Realised prices
reflect gains and losses on commodity derivatives, which are included within revenue.
(v)           The totals in the tables above may include some small apparent differences as the specific individual figures have not been
rounded.
(vi)          The production information and the cash cost information is derived from the Group's production report for the second quarter of
2016, published on 27 July 2016.
[1] EBITDA excluding the Group's share of EBITDA from associates and joint ventures.
