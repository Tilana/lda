Respondent

Appellant in Person
Mr. J. Rabuku for the State

JUDGMENT

This is an appeal against the sentence of 3 months= imprisonment imposed on the appellant for the offence of larceny contrary to section 259 and 262 of the Penal Code Cap. 17.

The appellant was charged for the offence of larceny of 4 bags of dalo valued at $200.00 the property of the complainant.

He asks that the sentence be made concurrent to the appeal in Criminal Appeal No. 7 of 2001 wherein he was given two years= imprisonment the same day as in this appeal.

I see no merit in this appeal and as already ordered by the learned Magistrate the sentence is to be served concurrent to the sentence of 15 months= imprisonment as varied this day in Criminal Appeal No. 7 of 2002.

The appeal is dismissed
