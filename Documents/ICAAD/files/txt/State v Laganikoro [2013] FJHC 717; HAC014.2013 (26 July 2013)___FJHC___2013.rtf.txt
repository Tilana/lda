1. Trial commenced on the 22nd July 2013 and concluded on the 26th July 2013. All three assessors unanimously found each Accused guilty on count of Rape against him.

2. I direct myself in accordance with the law and the evidence which I discussed in my Summing Up to the assessors.

3. Considering the nature of the evidence before the court, I am convinced that the prosecution had proved the case beyond reasonable doubt.
