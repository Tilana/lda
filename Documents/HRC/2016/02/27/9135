<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 7/19 
of 27 March 2007 entitled &#8220;Combating defamation of religions&#8221;, in which the Council invited the 
Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance to report to it at its ninth session on all manifestations of defamation of 
religions and in particular on the serious implications of Islamophobia on the enjoyment of all 
rights. 
</p>
<p> This report is to be read in conjunction with the previous reports that the Special 
Rapporteur has submitted to the Human Rights Council, namely: the report on the manifestations 
of defamation of religions and in particular on the serious implications of Islamophobia on the 
enjoyment of all rights (A/HRC/6/6); the report on incitement to racial and religious hatred and 
the promotion of tolerance (A/HRC/2/3) submitted to the Council jointly with the Special 
Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief; the reports submitted to the Commission on the 
situation of Muslims and Arab peoples in various parts of the world with special reference to 
physical assaults and attacks against their places of worship, cultural centres, businesses and 
properties in the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001 (E/CN.4/2003/23, 
E/CN.4/2005/19 and E/CN.4/2006/17); and the report entitled &#8220;Defamation of religions and 
global efforts to combat racism: anti-Semitism, Christianophobia and Islamophobia&#8221; 
(E/CN.4/2005/18/Add.4). 
</p>
<p> In accordance with the Human Rights Council&#8217;s request, the Special Rapporteur will focus 
in this report on the phenomenon of Islamophobia. However, he wishes to point out that this 
does not imply the establishment of any hierarchy in the forms of discrimination to which the 
different religions are subject. As he noted in his previous reports, strategies to combat anti-
Semitism, Christianophobia and Islamophobia should promote the idea that it is necessary to 
treat these different phobias in the same way and to avoid establishing any priorities with regard 
to combating all forms of discrimination. 
</p>
<p> The purpose of this report is therefore to summarize and update the main analyses, 
conclusions and recommendations of the Special Rapporteur in the various thematic reports on 
the defamation of religions submitted to the Council and the Commission. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur draws attention to some of the main recommendations in his 
previous report, submits three new proposals to the Human Rights Council and concludes by 
expressing the hope that the Council will invite Member States to promote dialogue among 
cultures, civilizations and religions, having particular regard to: 
</p>
<p> (a) The need to accord equal treatment to combating defamation of religions in all its 
forms so as to avoid establishing any hierarchy in the different manifestations of discrimination, 
even if they may vary in nature and degree depending on historical, geographical and cultural 
context; 
</p>
<p> (b) The deep historical and cultural roots of all forms of defamation of religions and the 
corresponding need to combine legal measures with an intellectual, cultural and ethical approach 
that takes account of the processes, mechanisms and representations at the origin of these 
manifestations of discrimination over time; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (c) The essential link between the different spiritual, historical and cultural forms of 
religious discrimination and the universal nature of their underlying causes; 
</p>
<p> (d) The need to create conditions conducive to encounter, dialogue and interaction in 
order to further social harmony, peace, respect for human rights and development and to combat 
all forms of racism, xenophobia and discrimination as they relate to all religions and spiritual 
traditions; 
</p>
<p> (e) The need to renew the approach to the problem of the defamation of religions by 
focusing on the principles and norms embodied in international human rights instruments, in 
particular article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article 4 of 
the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 7/19 
of 27 March 2007 entitled &#8220;Combating defamation of religions&#8221;, in which the Council invited 
the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
and related intolerance to report to it at its ninth session on all manifestations of defamation of 
religions and in particular on the serious implications of Islamophobia on the enjoyment of all 
rights. 
</p>
<p>2. This report is to be read in conjunction with the previous reports submitted by the Special 
Rapporteur to the Human Rights Council and the Commission on Human Rights, namely: the 
report on the manifestations of defamation of religions and in particular on the serious 
implications of Islamophobia on the enjoyment of all rights (A/HRC/6/6); the report on 
incitement to racial and religious hatred and the promotion of tolerance (A/HRC/2/3) submitted 
to the Council jointly with the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief; the reports 
submitted to the Commission on the situation of Muslims and Arab peoples in various parts of 
the world with special reference to physical assaults and attacks against their places of worship, 
cultural centres, businesses and properties in the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001 
(E/CN.4/2003/23, E/CN.4/2005/19 and E/CN.4/2006/17); and the report entitled &#8220;Defamation of 
religions and global efforts to combat racism: anti-Semitism, Christianophobia and 
Islamophobia&#8221; (E/CN.4/2005/18/Add.4). 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with the Human Rights Council&#8217;s request, the Special Rapporteur will focus 
in this report on the phenomenon of Islamophobia. However, he wishes to point out that this 
does not imply the establishment of any hierarchy in the forms of discrimination against the 
different religions. As he noted in his previous reports, strategies to combat anti-Semitism, 
Christianophobia and Islamophobia should promote the idea that it is necessary to treat these 
different phobias in the same way and to avoid establishing any priorities with regard to 
combating all forms of discrimination. 
</p>
<p>4. The purpose of this report is therefore to summarize and update the main analyses, 
conclusions and recommendations of the Special Rapporteur in the various thematic reports on 
the defamation of religions already submitted to the Council and the Commission. 
</p>
<p>5. In chapter I, the Special Rapporteur analyzes the phenomenon of defamation of religions 
and its different forms in the current political and ideological context. In chapter II, he 
summarizes his main analyses and conclusions concerning particular forms of religious-based 
discrimination, with special reference to Islamophobia in all its manifestations and particularly 
since the events of 11 September 2001, to anti-Semitism, to Christianophobia and to 
discrimination against other religions and spiritual traditions and practices. In chapter III, the 
Special Rapporteur spells out the relationship between each of these specific forms of 
discrimination and the universal nature of measures to combat racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance, stressing in particular the need to resituate the problem of 
the defamation of religions in terms of the principles and norms embodied in international 
human rights instruments. In chapter IV, he describes provisions aimed at combating incitement 
to national, racial or religious hatred and possible limitations to freedom of expression contained 
in various international and regional instruments and national enactments. In chapter V, in 
conclusion, he submits his recommendations. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>I.  THE CURRENT POLITICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL CONTEXT 
</b></p>
<p>6. The defamation of religions is part of a disturbing worldwide trend marked by the rise of 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, with its roots in the current 
political and ideological context. This context is characterized by five major forms of intellectual 
drift: the equation of the factors of race, culture and religion; a hierarchical rather than dialectical 
and complementary interpretation of human rights; suspicion of religion; rejection of diversity; 
and, finally, an excessive emphasis on the factors of identity and security reflecting a defensive 
and exclusive approach. 
</p>
<p>7. In his previous reports, the Special Rapporteur underlined that this political and ideological 
context is marked by three powerful tendencies apparent in all regions of the world. The most 
serious current manifestation of the regression in the struggle against racism is the resurgence of 
racist and xenophobic violence in the world. This tendency finds expression in particular in acts 
of physical violence perpetrated by extremist, neo-Nazi and nationalist groups targeting 
religious, ethnic or cultural communities. 
</p>
<p>8. The second powerful trend highlighted by the Special Rapporteur in his recent reports to 
the Council and the General Assembly involves the political banalization and democratic 
legitimization of racism and xenophobia. In particular, the Special Rapporteur notes with 
disquiet the way in which political parties preaching racist and xenophobic platforms manage to 
introduce and implement these ideas by means of government alliances that guarantee them a 
place on the political stage and access to the apparatus of the State. This democratic 
legitimization of racism currently represents the most serious threat to democracy and human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>9. The current political and ideological context is also strongly influenced by the intellectual 
and scientific legitimization of racism, xenophobia and intolerance, which constitutes the third 
major trend highlighted by the Special Rapporteur in the course of his term of office. This trend 
is illustrated by a growing number of so-called scientific publications and declarations whose 
stock-in-trade is historical stereotypes underlying prejudice and racist and xenophobic theories 
and manifesting themselves in an ethnic, racial or religious interpretation of current problems. 
Recent illustrations of this phenomenon include: the claims by Nobel Laureate in Medicine, 
James Watson, that persons of African descent are intellectually inferior, reviving historical 
stereotypes at the basis of anti-Black racism; the invitation to the negationist David Irving to 
speak at the Oxford Union Debating Society; the association of Islam with violence; the 
reductive association of Judaism with domination and power; and the identification of 
Christianity with Western domination. 
</p>
<p>10. This process involving the intellectual legitimization of racism, xenophobia and religious 
hatred springs from a deep-rooted rejection of multiculturalism and diversity, which is one of the 
main sources of the resurgence of racist, xenophobic and antireligious violence worldwide. The 
Special Rapporteur points out that, in ideological terms, the Manichean concept of the clash of 
civilizations and religions - the implicit hierarchization of cultures, races, civilizations and the 
mistrust of religions - represents the new ideological foundation for political and intellectual 
elites and erstwhile Cold-War ideologues. The new international context of the fight against 
terrorism has further strengthened the trend towards ideological polarization and the retreat into 
separate identities.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>11. The political and ideological context thus provides fertile ground for the resurgence of all 
the old forms of racism and xenophobia, from anti-Semitism to Islamophobia, as well as the 
emergence of new manifestations. It is against this background of the rise of racism and 
discrimination that the concept of the defamation of religions must be examined. 
</p>
<p>12. International ideological polarization is reflected among other things in a hierarchical and 
political interpretation of human rights and fundamental freedoms, in which connection the 
Special Rapporteur has noted not only the ideological pre-eminence of freedom of expression at 
the expense of other fundamental freedoms embodied in the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights but also ignorance of, or refusal to recognize, restrictions and limitations clearly 
specified in international instruments. The result of this hierarchization of fundamental rights is 
to legitimize, in the name of freedom of expression, overt incitement to racial and religious 
hatred and to promote the rhetorical concept of an inevitable clash of civilizations and religions, 
setting the West in opposition to other civilizations on the sole issue of the defence of freedom of 
expression. 
</p>
<p>13. In this report, the Special Rapporteur stresses that political and ideological polarization on 
the question of the defamation of religions is artificial. Indeed, analysis of international, regional 
and national human rights instruments shows that provisions against inducement to national, 
racial or religious hatred are almost universal. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, shifting the 
debate away from the sociological concept of the defamation of religions towards the legal 
concept of incitement to national, racial or religious hatred is not only a way of refocusing on 
human rights but also a strategy for de-polarizing and de-politicizing the discussion. 
</p>
<p><b>II. THE FORMS AND MANIFESTATIONS OF  
RELIGIOUS DISCRIMINATION 
</b></p>
<p>14. The analysis of religious discrimination is inseparable from the ideological context that 
encourages intolerance, rejection of diversity and discrimination itself, in which political, 
cultural and intellectual elites play a leading role. Such an ideological climate can ultimately lead 
to encouragement and justification of physical or intellectual violence. In particular, the 
justification of discrimination and intolerance tends to encourage the banalization of 
discrimination and can give rise to other forms of this phenomenon, such as the 
institutionalization of discriminatory practices or attacks on the followers of a religion or their 
places of worship and culture and the expression of intolerance and aggression directed at 
religious symbols. 
</p>
<p>15. The political and ideological treatment of religion is sometimes institutionalized in the 
form of written or unwritten rules and behaviour that in practice lead to social discrimination and 
marginalization and to restrictions on religious freedom. Apart from increasingly openly 
discriminatory legislation, various practices can compromise the enjoyment of religious freedom, 
such as restrictions on the building of places of worship or display of religious symbols. 
Institutionalized discrimination is a major obstacle for religious minorities in various countries; it 
is reflected in policies such as those making it compulsory for religious communities to register 
with the authorities through discriminatory procedures, special restrictions on the free 
distribution of religious texts or bans targeting the practices of minority religions. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>16. A third kind of religious discrimination involves physical violence, which tends to take the 
form of isolated acts of aggression, often committed by individuals or extremist groups. In some 
cases, however, these individual acts are the reflection of the ideological context, particularly 
where other forms of discrimination are present, such as institutionalized discriminatory 
practices. Moreover, physical violence can lead to large-scale religious violence, in the form of 
massacres and pogroms. The most widespread form of violence is verbal in nature, ranging from 
individual insults in public places to demonization by the media. 
</p>
<p>17. These expressions of religious hatred are not mutually exclusive, but are rather the 
different facets of a wider phenomenon. In most settings where discrimination and religious 
hatred occur, each aspect of discrimination reinforces all the others, forming a vicious circle of 
discrimination and violence that, when it attains a certain critical mass, reinforces polarization 
and antagonisms, lending plausibility to apocalyptic theories of the clash of civilizations and 
religions. 
</p>
<p>18. This chapter summarizes the main findings of the Special Rapporteur concerning 
Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, Christianophobia and other forms of religious discrimination. The 
Special Rapporteur underlines the need to analyze the context of the increase in all forms of 
religious discrimination in order to fully understand the emergence of an ideological climate that 
is conducive to incitement to national, racial or religious hatred and that threaten the enjoyment 
of all human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Islamophobia 
</b></p>
<p>19. In his recent reports on the defamation of religions and on the situation of Arab peoples 
and Muslims in various parts of the world, the Special Rapporteur has noted that Islamophobia is 
increasing worldwide, particularly following the events of September 2001. To contribute to a 
clearer understanding of Islamophobia, the Special Rapporteur has proposed the following 
definition: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;This term refers to a baseless hostility and fear vis-&#224;-vis Islam, and as a result a fear 
of and aversion towards all Muslims or the majority of them. It also refers to the practical 
consequences of this hostility in terms of discrimination, prejudices and unequal treatment 
of which Muslims (individuals and communities) are victims and their exclusion from 
major political and social spheres. The term was invented in response to a new reality: the 
increasing discrimination against Muslims which has manifested itself in recent years.&#8221; 
(E/CN.4/2005/18/Add.4, para. 13) 
</p>
<p>20. Islamophobia is not a new phenomenon, dating as it does from Islam&#8217;s earliest contacts 
with other religions and cultures, in particular the encounter with the Christian world, of which 
the crusades represent the paroxysm. Its rise in our own time is linked to four major factors: the 
profound crisis of identity in the Western world consequent upon the development of a 
non-Western multiculturalism with a strong Muslim component; the movement of political and 
religious polarization linked to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; the ideological interpretation of 
the geostrategic upheavals linked to the petrol crisis; and the emergence of political movements 
legitimizing the recourse to violence by Islam. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>21. The rise of Islamophobia is reflected in the adoption of national policies and laws 
characterized by the social and political stigmatization of Muslim minorities, religious profiling 
and security targeting. These policies are legitimatized by a conception of identity that excludes 
Islam, by the electoral success of overtly Islamophobe political platforms, by the rise of 
ideological secularism among elites suspicious of all forms of religious expression, and by an 
approach to immigration geared to questions of security and ethnic origin. 
</p>
<p>22. This is the context for various forms of discrimination and intolerance towards Muslims, 
including individual acts of physical and verbal violence, recourse to stereotypes and 
stigmatization, institutionalized discrimination and the appearance of direct or indirect 
incitement to religious hatred. Freedom of religion is also directly affected. In his previous 
reports, the Special Rapporteur has noted that &#8220;Muslims are finding it increasingly difficult to 
establish places of worship and observe their religious practices (eating habits, funeral rites). 
Against this background, political parties with openly anti-Islamic platforms have in a number of 
countries joined government coalitions and begun to implement their agendas. In other words 
Islamophobia is in the process of pervading all aspects of social life.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>23. Islamophobia likewise represents a powerful trend in ideological and intellectual terms. It 
has become the substitute ideology for a number of Cold War theoreticians. Its two main 
intellectual components are identification of Islam with violence and terrorism, and the 
inevitability of a conflict of civilizations and religions. The influence of this intellectual basis of 
Islamophobia, as well as its popular impact, stems from various propagandist strategies. The 
exploitation of freedom of expression is a particularly effective weapon in justifying and 
promoting an ideological, selective and hierarchical interpretation of fundamental human rights, 
ignoring the restrictions and limitations embodied in articles 18, 19 and 20 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, in particular the crucial restriction of non-incitement to 
racial and religious hatred. The development and propagation of these notions by the media has 
the effect of rooting Islamophobia in the collective unconscious. Their exploitation of these 
concepts as political capital for electoral purposes banalizes Islamophobia. The electoral success 
of these platforms as effective strategies for combating terrorism and defending national identity 
and security not only makes Islamophobia common place but also, more seriously, lends it 
democratic legitimacy, enabling its proponents to put it into practice through participation in 
government coalitions. The most recent example of this intellectual construction of 
Islamophobia, typically the product of a Cold War ideologue, is the work by Norman Podhoretz, 
founder of the highly influential review<i> Commentary</i>, entitled <i>World War IV: The Long Struggle 
Against Islamofascism</i> (2007). This work represents a theoretical formulation of Islamophobia, 
identifying a religion - Islam - with a political ideology of European origin - fascism - thereby 
lending credibility and substance to Samuel Huntington&#8217;s thesis of the inevitable clash of 
civilizations, seen in terms of the opposition between Islam and the West, and anticipating its 
outcome in the form of World War IV. These two rhetorical concepts - the clash of civilizations 
and Islamofascism - are gaining intellectual, media and political currency in an increasing 
number of influential circles. 
</p>
<p>24. In his previous report on the defamation of religions (A/HRC/6/6), the Special Rapporteur 
analysed the main forms and manifestations of Islamophobia. He noted in particular the tendency 
to downplay the Islamophobe character of individual acts of discrimination, such as Muslim </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>women having their <i>hijab</i>, or headscarf, forcibly removed in public places. The Special 
Rapporteur also drew attention to the increasing number of cases of physical and verbal 
aggression directed at Muslims. He pointed out that airports remain a focus for individual acts of 
Islamophobia by passengers and sometimes by crew members, as well as for institutional 
discrimination on the part of security and immigration officials. 
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur also noted with disquiet the collective manifestations of 
discrimination and intolerance towards Islam, particularly as regards its outward signs. These 
manifestations are accompanied by an intolerant secularist rhetoric leading to still greater 
discrimination against Muslims. This powerful trend is particularly marked in relation to the 
construction of mosques: systematic opposition to the building of mosques and minarets is the 
most symbolic expression of Islamophobia in terms of the denial of religious freedom in two of 
its most basic aspects - the visibility of religious practice and the availability of a place of 
worship. A recent example is the demolition in May 2008 of a mosque in the town of Verona 
(Italy) following a systematic campaign by a number of leaders of the Northern league, a major 
political component of the current coalition Government in Italy. The projected referendum on 
the banning of minarets by a party that is a long-time member of the Government coalition in 
Switzerland is part of the same current of intolerance and xenophobia. Legal harassment against 
the construction of mosques or minarets illustrates the crucial nature of this question in the 
programme of many political parties, particularly those of nationalist and extreme-right 
persuasion. 
</p>
<p>26. Throughout his term of office, the Special Rapporteur has emphasized that the place to be 
accorded to Islam represents a key issue in the construction of the new European identity, as 
illustrated during the preparation of the draft European Constitution by the proposal - ultimately 
rejected - that it should include an explicit reference to Europe&#8217;s Christian roots. A similar line of 
thought lies behind the arguments of those opposed to Turkey&#8217;s membership of the European 
Union, with periodic contributions from certain members of Europe&#8217;s political and intellectual 
elites. The Special Rapporteur notes in this connection that the question that is overlooked in the 
debate on the construction of Europe, largely focused on its political and economic dimensions, 
is that of the reconstruction of a multicultural identity in the new Europe. 
</p>
<p>27. The central issues at stake in the manifestations and expressions of Islamophobia are 
freedom of religious belief and incitement to racial and religious hatred. In its most sophisticated 
expressions, particularly its ideological justification and theoretical formulation, Islamophobia 
links these two issues. The challenge to the principle of freedom of religious belief as it relates to 
Islam, particularly its outward signs and expression, is reflected in a deliberate strategy of 
incitement to racial and religious hatred. Its legitimization is centred on the &#8220;defence&#8221; of two 
particularly sensitive topics - national identity and security. Its rhetorical concepts serve as the 
basis for intellectual constructions and are exploited in political platforms and nurture media 
images: suspicion of the believer as backward-looking, irrational and non-modern; association of 
Islam with violence and terrorism, particularly since 11 September 2001; identification of 
multiculturalism and immigration as threats to national, ethnic, cultural and religious identity. Its 
psychological springs are fear, immurement and rejection. The two key issues ultimately at stake 
here relate to the fundamental freedoms defined and elaborated in the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, in particular articles 18, 19 and 20. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>28. The ideological context of the rise of religious discrimination and incitement to racial or 
religious hatred was illustrated once again in March 2008 when the film <i>Fitna</i> produced by 
Geert Wilders, a Dutch parliamentarian and founder of the Freedom Party (Partij voor de 
Vrijheid - PVV), was broadcast on the Internet. The essentialist association of Islam with 
violence is the mainspring of the film, which intersperses verses from the Koran with images of 
terrorist attacks, with the murder of the Dutch producer Theo Van Gogh and with anti-Semitic 
declarations. When the film was first broadcast, the Special Rapporteur together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the freedom of religion or belief and the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression issued a press release 
criticizing the fallacious and provocative nature of the film. While recognizing the balanced 
reaction of the Dutch Government in rejecting the equation of Islam with violence, the Special 
Rapporteurs had called on national and international human rights mechanisms to initiate a 
debate on the best way to ensure the complementarity between the right to freedom of expression 
and non-incitement to racial or religious hatred. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Anti-Semitism 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur wishes to restate the essential points made in his previous reports, 
in particular the resilience of anti-Semitism in its historical heartlands in Europe as well as its 
development in regions with no corresponding tradition or historical heritage, such as Africa and 
South America; the profound historical roots of anti-Semitism and its ability to adapt to new 
social and political contexts; and the need to treat all forms of discrimination on an equal basis. 
</p>
<p>30. The most recurrent form of modern anti-Semitism involves negation of the Holocaust. The 
refusal to recognize the historical fact of the Nazi regime&#8217;s project for a &#8220;Final Solution&#8221;, namely 
the devising and implementation of the plan for &#8220;destruction of the European Jews&#8221;, highlights 
two characteristics of anti-Semitism: its deep historical and cultural roots, and the central role of 
memory in opposing it. The persistence of anti-Semitism in Europe reflects its deep and 
pervasive roots in cultures, mentalities, representations and psyches. The ritual reference to 
Judeo-Christian roots masks the historical fact that European identity was to some extent forged 
on the basis of anti-Semitism. The enlargement of the European Union has reinforced this 
deep-rooted anti-Semitism with the vitality of the anti-Semitism found in most of the countries 
of Eastern Europe. The Special Rapporteur wishes here to draw the Council&#8217;s attention to the 
disturbing tendency in Europe to conceal this silent and subterranean anti-Semitism, present not 
only in popular culture but above all in the intellectual and ideological heritage of elites; to 
relegate it in all events to the ideology of the extreme right; and to overestimate, thereby 
encouraging a measure of Islamophobia, the existence among immigrant circles of anti-Semitism 
linked to an ethnic reading of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is indeed among elites that 
revisionism remains strongly active, in terms of silence over the events of the past as well as the 
intellectual reinterpretation of history and negation of the Holocaust. It is in this context that the 
Special Rapporteur has moreover noted a certain exploitation of anti-Semitism in some 
traditional and religious circles whose opportunistic and much publicized opposition to 
anti-Semitism masks the persistence of a profound current of anti-Semitism. A recent illustration 
was provided by an American evangelical pastor who maintained that Hitler had served as the 
expression of divine will by creating the circumstances for the return of the Jews to Israel. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur has observed that the systematic equation of anti-Zionism with 
anti-Semitism has the effect of making it more difficult to combat anti-Semitism. The equation 
of a political ideology, Zionism, with a form of racism reinforces the essentialist and reductive 
vision characteristic of a deep current of anti-Semitism denying the political and ideological 
diversity of the Jewish people and manifesting itself also in relation to Zionism. In its most 
political form, this identification leads to the characterization as anti-Semitic of any criticism of 
the State of Israel, in particular the different facets of its occupation of the Palestinian territories 
as defined by the United Nations. This tendency to construe opposition to a political ideology 
and the political actions of a State as racism targeted at a whole people is not only a denial of the 
democratic legitimacy of political criticism but also blurs the analysis and understanding of 
anti-Semitism, in particular any objective assessment of the anti-Semitism entering into 
anti-Zionism and criticism of the State of Israel. 
</p>
<p>32. The slow but pervasive spread of anti-Semitism to parts of the world where it has no 
historical or cultural tradition is a particularly disturbing manifestation of contemporary 
anti-Semitism. The globalization of this form of racism is the result of a number of political, 
cultural and geographical factors. In South America, the growth of anti-Semitism stems from two 
main causes, the most enduring being the deep historical and cultural tradition of racism, in the 
sense of racial hierarchization, representing the ideological pillar of the colonial and slave 
system. This racial ideology, targeting in the first instance the native and black African slave 
populations, did not spare the figure of the Jew, demonized as part of the cultural and religious 
heritage of the conquistadors and of the European colonialists. This historical anti-Semitism was 
given a new lease of life as a result of South America proving the favourite bolt-hole of a large 
number of Nazi leaders, who brought with them from Hitler&#8217;s Germany the anti-Semitic 
ideology at the origin of the Holocaust. This strong racist current was reflected both in 
ideological influence and in technical support for the acts of mass repression and torture by 
conservative or fascist political circles engaged in a war against progressive movements, as well 
as in the development of neo-Nazi groups. In Africa, the emergence - still marginal - of a vein of 
anti-Semitism is the result of an ethnic interpretation of the Israeli-Palestinian political conflict 
and the association of the Israeli with the demonized figure of the Jew. This process of 
identification and stereotyping is also found in Asian countries. The Special Rapporteur stresses 
that the current worldwide character of anti-Semitism demands a global response. In this 
connection, he underlines the fundamental importance of examining this phenomenon 
systematically in the framework of the Durban Agenda review process, with the participation of 
organizations involved in combating anti-Semitism, particularly at the scheduled regional 
meetings. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Christianophobia 
</b></p>
<p>33. Christianophobia, like the other religious phobias, has deep historical and cultural roots 
reflecting the theological conditions associated with the genesis of the three religions of the 
Book and the historical circumstances surrounding the construction of their identities. However, 
its main contemporary political source is the persistent identification of Christianity and the West 
as a consequence of their close association during the era of European colonization. Three recent 
phenomena have served to reinforce and legitimize this identification. A decisive turning point 
was the Islamophobe tone in certain countries of the campaign against terrorism particularly 
subsequent to the tragic events of 11 September 2001. Christianity adopted the stance of a 
rational religion opposed to an Islamic faith associated basically with violence and terrorism. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>The theory of the clash of civilisations and religions, representing the ideological formulation of 
this radical difference, developed mainly by cold war theoreticians, postulates the inevitable 
conflict between the Christian West and the Arab Muslim world. Finally, opposition to the 
process of social multiculturalization resulting essentially from migratory trends, is reflected in 
the construction of identities that, among other things, reduce the European identity to 
Christianity and exclude Islam. Thus the identification of Christianity with the West, one of the 
sources of Christianophobia, is as much the product of ideologues and even religious figures in 
the Western Christian world as of religious or political groups hostile to Christianity.  
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur has also highlighted the negative role played in the development of 
Christianophobia by the aggressive proselytism of certain evangelical groups, particularly from 
North America, which have produced strong reactions of hostility and opposition to Christianity 
in South America, Africa and Asia. In his previous report on the defamation of religions 
(A/HRC/6/6), the Special Rapporteur referred to examples in India where the distribution of 
literature against Hinduism by evangelical groups calling for the destruction of Hindu religious 
symbols has revived resistance to Christianity going back to the colonial era. This opposition is 
gradually developing into open and virulent hostility to the mass conversion to Christianity of 
Untouchables wishing to flee the burdens of age-old discriminatory practices with their roots in 
Hinduism. In South America, and particularly Brazil, the demonization by certain evangelical 
groups of Afro-Brazilian religions, such as Candombl&#233;, have produced distrust and hostility 
towards Christianity in general. 
</p>
<p>35. In Europe, Christianophobia, like Islamophobia, is linked to a powerful cultural current of 
dogmatic secularism that nurtures a suspicion of religion justified with reference to the historic 
conquest of the separation of Church and State. This strong cultural and ideological trend, the 
radical and influential expression of Nietzsche&#8217;s proclaimed &#8220;death of God&#8221;, has encouraged the 
emergence in intellectual and media circles of an anti-religious culture and has favoured a 
growing intolerance towards any kind of religious practice, expression or symbol. The decline of 
religious practice and church attendance and the crisis of priestly vocations are illustrations of 
this phenomenon. This intolerance is even reflected in the denial of the citizen&#8217;s democratic right 
to express his or her convictions and spiritual or religious values in pronouncements on political 
questions or major social issues and crises. Christianophobia is thus at root the expression of an 
imbalance between the legitimate defence of secularism and respect for freedom of religion. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Other forms of religious discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur wishes once again, expanding on his previous report on the 
defamation of religions (A/HRC/6/6), to draw the Council&#8217;s attention to two important 
dimensions of religious discrimination and defamation: intra-religious discrimination and 
defamation, and discrimination and defamation with respect to the spiritual and syncretistic 
traditions, sects, religious minorities and new religious movements. 
</p>
<p>37. The intra-religious dimension is one of the most pervasive and historically most violent 
and tenacious manifestations of religious discrimination and defamation. All the religions and 
spiritual traditions, in particular the religions of the Book, have experienced theological 
differences and internal political divisions giving rise to violent conflicts and sustained strategies 
of reciprocal denigration, demonization and self-justification. Christianity and Islam, from the 
Inquisition to the fatwa, have been the theatre of conflicts whose violence, scope and persistence </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>have structured in lasting fashion the identity and culture of many countries. History books, 
literary works, artistic creations, educational programmes and self-proclaiming scientific 
research have been the instruments over time of this sustained intra-religious defamation in the 
collective awareness and popular imagination. 
</p>
<p>38, The Special Rapporteur also wishes to express his concern at the situation of members of 
spiritual and syncretistic traditions, sects, religious minorities and new religious movements. 
These minority groups are often vulnerable to intolerance, discrimination and defamatory 
statements; and they are frequently subject to various forms of discrimination, notably as a 
consequence of government policies and national legislation, such as registration procedures, 
restrictions on places of worship and cultural centres, and various religious profiling operations. 
Exploitation, legal vacuums and demonization of the notion of sect are pointers not only to the 
rise of anti-religious ideological intolerance but also of resistance on the part of established 
religions to the emergence of new spiritual sensibilities and traditions, adding up to a serious 
erosion of religious freedom. 
</p>
<p>39. The scope of the issues relating to discrimination, intolerance and defamation among 
different religions and towards members of spiritual and syncretistic traditions, sects, religious 
minorities and new religious movements prompts the Special Rapporteur to underline and 
endorse the importance of a broad understanding of the terms &#8220;conviction&#8221; and &#8220;religion&#8221;, as 
recommended by the Human Rights Committee in its general comment No. 22 (1993). 
</p>
<p><b>III.  THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DISCRIMINATION 
</b></p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur notes that efforts to combat religious discrimination, including 
incitement to national, racial or religious hatred, should take into account the complex dialectic 
between, on the one hand, recognition of the theological, cultural, historical and geographical 
uniqueness of every religion and spiritual tradition and of the forms and manifestations of the 
discrimination and defamation associated with them and, on the other, the universal nature of the 
underlying causes of such discrimination and defamation and of efforts to combat them. 
</p>
<p>41. The struggle against all forms of discrimination poses a fundamental and complex 
challenge, at once political and ethical. The political challenge addressed to multicultural 
societies, with their diverse legacies of discrimination and domination, is to devise policies and 
programmes organized around two principles, namely recognition of and respect for the unique 
nature of the memory of each group or community, and the construction of a collective or 
national memory that promotes reciprocal knowledge, interaction, and the sharing of the inner 
feelings and history of each. It is in the field of religion and beliefs - where feelings and a sense 
of belonging are most profound - that the challenge is most difficult. Two processes should 
combine in order to achieve the fundamental and supreme goal of living together in harmony - 
consisting, on the one hand, of the shared work of memory represented by the writing and 
teaching of history as a multicultural memory, and, on the other, by the devising of a national 
system of values perpetually under permanent construction and nurtured by the interactions 
between the cultural and spiritual values of all the communities, based on respect for the precepts 
of international law and human rights. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>42. The ethical challenge inherent in the tension between the uniqueness of each phobia and 
the universality of their causes corresponds to the fundamental and difficult choice that the 
victims must make, whether individuals or groups, between retreat into separate identity or 
solidarity with all victims. Retreat is the expression of the priority given by the victim of 
discrimination, including defamation, to the unique character of his or her own experience. It 
leads not only to a lack of empathy with the sufferings of other communities and respect for their 
memory, but also to the temptation to create a hierarchy of phobias. 
</p>
<p>43. The ideologues and theoreticians of the clash of civilizations and religions exploit and 
derive their legitimacy from the lack of solidarity between the victims of Islamophobia, 
anti-Semitism, Christianophobia and other forms of defamation of religions and discrimination. 
This tendency, exploited by political parties, is the main obstacle to the universal and effective 
struggle against discrimination in general and the defamation of religions in particular. Another 
approach, more difficult from both the individual and collective standpoint, consists in 
recognizing the universality of all forms of discrimination, that is to say, transforming the 
uniqueness of one&#8217;s experience into solidarity with the cultural, ethnic and religious experience 
of other communities. This approach is individualistic from an ethical standpoint and collective 
from a political standpoint. It rests on the following elements: (a) in the legal sphere, equal 
treatment for all religions; (b) in the political sphere, the achievement of a difficult balance 
between freedom of expression and freedom of religion; (c) in the cultural sphere, a multicultural 
approach to education in general and the teaching of history in particular; and (d) in the social 
sphere, realization of the goal of &#8220;living in harmony&#8221; in all spheres of multicultural coexistence 
(housing, urban planning ,workplace, etc.). 
</p>
<p><b>IV. INCITEMENT TO NATIONAL, RACIAL OR RELIGIOUS  
HATRED IN INTERNATIONAL, REGIONAL AND  
NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS INSTRUMENTS 
</b></p>
<p>44. In the preceding chapters, the Special Rapporteur has sought to draw the Council&#8217;s 
attention to the basic characteristic common to all manifestations of religious defamation and all 
forms of religious phobia and discrimination, namely incitement to racial and religious hatred. In 
order to address the question of the defamation of religions from a universal standpoint, it is 
essential to relate the discussion to international human rights instruments. In particular, the 
Special Rapporteur notes that provisions relating to incitement to national, racial or religious 
hatred already form part of the main international instruments to which a large majority of 
countries are signatory. Linking the political discussion on the treatment of religious 
discrimination to specific legal provisions will show that combating incitement to hatred is not a 
North-South ideological question but a reality present in a large majority of national legislations 
in all regions. 
</p>
<p>45. With a view to promoting this change of paradigm, translating religious defamation from a 
sociological notion into a legal human rights concept, namely incitement to racial and religious 
hatred, the Special Rapporteur will consider the provisions of international, regional and national 
instruments concerning three fundamental questions, namely freedom of expression, religious 
freedom and incitement to national, racial or religious hatred. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>A. International instruments 
</b></p>
<p>46. The principal human rights instruments contain specific provisions prohibiting incitement 
to national, racial or religious hatred. Article 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
refers, in more general terms, to incitement to discrimination by affirming that &#8220;All are entitled 
to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any 
incitement to such discrimination.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>47. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, for its part, deals more 
specifically with the interdependence of freedom of expression and other fundamental rights. 
Limitations on the right to freedom of expression are introduced in articles 19 and 20 of the 
Covenant. Article 19 refers to &#8220;special duties and responsibilities&#8221; relating to the exercise of 
freedom of expression, which may be subject to certain restrictions to ensure &#8220;respect of the 
rights or reputations of others&#8221; and the &#8220;protection of national security or of public order 
(<i>ordre public</i>) or of public health or morals&#8221;. However, as formulated by the Covenant, these 
restrictions are not binding; moreover, to avoid their arbitrary application, the limitations must be 
&#8220;such as are provided by law&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>48. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur also refers to general comment No. 10 of the 
Human Rights Committee concerning article 19 of the Covenant. In its comment, the Committee 
expressly underlines that &#8220;when a State party imposes certain restrictions on the exercise of 
freedom of expression, these may not put in jeopardy the right itself. Paragraph 3 lays down 
conditions and it is only subject to these conditions that restrictions may be imposed: the 
restrictions must be &#8220;provided by law&#8221;; they may only be imposed for one of the purposes set out 
in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph 3; and they must be justified as being &#8220;necessary&#8221; for 
that State party for one of those purposes&#8221;. In declaring that restrictions relating to the exercise 
of freedom of expression may not put in jeopardy the right itself, the Human Rights Committee 
clarifies the notion of complementarity - and not competition - between the different rights 
enumerated in the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>49. The question of incitement to national, racial or religious hatred is addressed more 
explicitly in article 20 of the Covenant, which contains further limitations to the right to freedom 
of expression. The Special Rapporteur points out that the limitations prescribed by this article are 
not optional but binding for all the signatories. According to this article, &#8220;Any advocacy of 
national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to religious discrimination, hostility 
or violence shall be prohibited by law.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>50. With regard to the interpretation of article 20 of the Covenant, the Special Rapporteur 
refers to the joint report submitted with the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief 
to the second session of the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/2/3). The report mentions the 
paucity of jurisprudence on article 20, reiterating that the interpretation of its terms and, in 
particular, a definition of its threshold of application would be particularly welcome in order to 
avoid confusion or simplistic conclusions regarding its application. In that regard, the two 
Rapporteurs encouraged the Human Rights Committee to consider the possibility of adopting 
complementary standards on the interrelations between freedom of expression, freedom of 
religion and non-discrimination, in particular by drafting a general comment on article 20.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the response of the Committee, which has indicated that 
despite the fact that general comments on other provisions of the Covenant are already scheduled 
the Committee will consider as soon as possible the recommendation of the Special Rapporteurs 
concerning article 20. 
</p>
<p>52. In addition to the limitations on the exercise of freedom of expression prescribed in the 
Covenant, the Special Rapporteur also refers to the International Convention on the Elimination 
of all Forms of Racial Discrimination. Under the terms of article 4 (a) of the Convention, the 
States parties: &#8220;Shall declare an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based on 
racial superiority or hatred, incitement to racial discrimination, as well as all acts of violence or 
incitement to such acts against any race or group of persons of another colour or ethnic origin, 
and also the provision of any assistance to racist activities, including the financing thereof.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>53. With regard to the interpretation of article 4 of the Convention, the Special Rapporteur 
refers to Recommendation XV of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Prejudice, in 
which the Committee expresses the opinion that &#8220;the prohibition of the dissemination of all ideas 
based upon racial superiority or hatred is compatible with the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression. This right is embodied in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
and is recalled in article 5 (d) (viii) of the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination. Its relevance to article 4 is noted in the article itself. The 
citizen&#8217;s exercise of this right carries special duties and responsibilities, specified in article 29, 
paragraph 2, of the Universal Declaration, among which the obligation not to disseminate racist 
ideas is of particular importance. The Committee wishes, furthermore, to draw to the attention of 
States parties to article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, according 
to which any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to 
discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Regional instruments 
</b></p>
<p>54.<b> </b>The Special Rapporteur notes that the regional systems for the protection of human rights 
have also adopted instruments establishing limitations on the exercise of freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p>55. The European Human Rights Convention, under article 10 on freedom of expression, 
provides that, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, the exercise of that freedom 
&#8220;may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law 
and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity 
or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, 
for the protection of the reputation or rights of others&#8221;. However, the European Convention 
contains no provision equivalent to article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights concerning incitement to national, racial or religious hatred. Moreover, the European 
Commission against Racism and Intolerance, in its general policy recommendation No. 7 on 
national legislation to combat racism and racial discrimination, recommends to Member States 
that the law should penalize public incitement to violence, hatred or discrimination as well as the 
public expression of an ideology that depreciates or denigrates a grouping of persons on the 
grounds of their race, religion, national origin, etc. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>56. The African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights contains no direct reference to 
incitement to national, racial or religious hatred, but declares in article 27 that &#8220;The rights and 
freedoms of each individual shall be exercised with due regard to the rights of others, collective 
security, morality and common interest.&#8221; The Declaration of Principles on Freedom of 
Expression in Africa, adopted by the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, 
makes no reference to limitations on the exercise of the right to freedom of expression for the 
protection of the reputation of others. 
</p>
<p>57. As regards the inter-American human rights protection system, the American Convention 
on Human Rights recognizes in article 13 limitations relating to respect for the rights or 
reputations of others. In the same article, it addresses directly the question of inducement to 
hatred, declaring that: &#8220;Any propaganda for war and any advocacy of national, racial, or 
religious hatred that constitute incitements to lawless violence or to any other similar action 
against any person or group of persons on any grounds including those of race, colour, religion, 
language, or national origin shall be considered as offenses punishable by law.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>C.  National legislation 
</b></p>
<p>58.<b> </b>In addition to the aforementioned international and regional instruments, the Special 
Rapporteur also notes that most national legislations of countries in all regions contain 
provisions that protect against incitement to national, racial or religious hatred. A systematic 
analysis of the national instruments, in particular constitutions and penal codes, cannot be 
attempted within the scope of this study. However, the Special Rapporteur would note that 
domestic provisions limiting the exercise of freedom of expression involve various kinds of 
special restrictions. In the European context for example, the Venice Commission has identified 
four types of restriction: blasphemy, offending religious feeling or insulting doctrine; obstructing 
the exercise of worship and/or of religious freedom; disparaging an object of worship; and 
inducement to discrimination or to religious hatred.<b>1</b> Of the 47 European countries considered in 
this study, 43 have provisions relating to incitement to discrimination or religious hatred. Many 
countries in other regions of the world also have domestic provisions relating to incitement to 
national, racial or religious hatred. 
</p>
<p>59. A more exhaustive analysis of national legislations would show that, contrary to the 
international polarization concerning the phenomenon of the defamation of religions, there is a 
broad consensus among Member States in recognizing limitations on freedom of expression so 
as to prohibit incitement to national, racial or religious hatred. By linking the discussion on the 
defamation of religions to human rights instruments, in particular the provisions relating to 
incitement to national, racial or religious hatred, a close correspondence will be found to exist 
with specific clauses in the domestic legal systems of a number of Member States.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>V.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>In this chapter, the Special Rapporteur recapitulates for the last time the 
recommendations made in the previous reports to the Human Rights Council with a view 
to promoting measures to combat racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia. 
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Human Rights Council call upon 
Governments of Member States to continue to work for implementation of the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, which should remain the cornerstone of 
efforts to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>The Special Rapporteur invites the Human Rights Council to appeal to the 
Governments of Member States to evince and demonstrate a firm political will and 
commitment to opposing the rise of racial and religious hatred. In this context, 
Governments should be particularly vigilant in preventing the political exploitation of 
discrimination and xenophobia, notably the ideological and electoral insinuation of racist 
and xenophobic platforms in the programmes of democratic parties, and should strongly 
reaffirm the principle that respect for human rights, including the eradication of the 
culture of racism, xenophobia and intolerance, constitutes the main pillar of national 
security and democracy and should not be placed in the service of ideological or political 
convenience. 
</b></p>
<p>63.<b> The Special Rapporteur invites the Human Rights Council to take greater account 
than in the past, in combating racism and discrimination, of a twin development: the 
growing interlinking of the factors of race, ethnicity, culture and religion, which should be 
deconstructed as a matter of urgency; and the widespread rise of anti-Semitism, 
Christianophobia, Islamophobia and other forms of religious discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Human Rights Council invite 
Governments, in combating racial and religious hatred, to fully comply with their 
obligations in relation to freedom of expression and freedom of religion, in keeping with the 
relevant international instruments and in particular articles 18, 19 and 20 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, having due regard to their 
interrelations and complementarity. 
</b></p>
<p>65.  <b>The Special Rapporteur strongly recommends that the Human Rights Council 
encourage a shift away from the sociological concept of the defamation of religions towards 
the legal norm of non-incitement to national, racial or religious hatred, on the basis of the 
legal provisions laid down in international human rights instruments, in particular  
articles 18 to 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article 4 of 
the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Prejudice. 
</b>66.  <b>In the light of the divergent and conflicting interpretations of these articles, the 
Special Rapporteur wishes to recall the recommendation he made to the Human Rights 
Council in the report submitted jointly with the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion 
or belief (A/HRC/2/3), namely to undertake deeper reflection on the interpretation of these </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>provisions. In particular, both Special Rapporteurs had encouraged the Human Rights 
Committee to consider the possibility of adopting complementary standards on the 
interrelations between freedom of expression, freedom of religion and non-discrimination, 
in particular in the form of a general comment on article 20. 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Human Rights Council invite 
Member States to promote the dialogue between cultures, civilizations and religions having 
regard to: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The need to accord equal treatment to combating defamation of religions in all 
its forms so as to avoid establishing any hierarchy in the different manifestations of 
discrimination, even if they may vary in nature and degree depending on historical, 
geographical and cultural context; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(b) The deep historical and cultural roots of all forms of defamation of religions and 
the corresponding need to combine legal measures with an intellectual, cultural and ethical 
approach that takes account of the processes, mechanisms and representations at the origin 
of these manifestations of discrimination over time; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(c) The essential link between the different spiritual, historical and cultural forms 
of religious discrimination and the universal nature of their underlying causes; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The need to create conditions conducive to encounter, dialogue and interaction 
in order to further social harmony, peace, respect for human rights and development and 
to combat all forms of racism, xenophobia and discrimination as they relate to all religions 
and spiritual traditions; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e)  The need to be vigilant in maintaining a balance between the defence of 
secularism and respect for religious freedom. Governments should pay particular attention 
to safeguarding and protecting the places of worship and culture of all religions and to 
furthering the free expression of their religious and spiritual beliefs. 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>The Special Rapporteur strongly recommends that the practice of intercultural and 
interreligious dialogue should begin at the national level through the promotion of mutual 
knowledge and joint action on the major social challenges and the furtherance and 
observance of human rights. Efforts to promote cultural and religious pluralism within 
each country are a necessary and meaningful first step towards promoting the dialogue 
among cultures and religions at the international level. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Human Rights Council invite 
Member States to promote critical introspection of an historical and theological nature in 
order to recognize and discover solutions to the intra-religious conflicts that fuel the 
reciprocal defamation of religions.
