<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its eleventh session from 2 
to 13 May 2011.  The review of Singapore was held at the 9th meeting on 6 May 2011. The 
delegation of Singapore was headed by Mr. Ong Keng Yong , Ambassador-at-Large in the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs At its 13th meeting held on 10 May 2011, the Working Group 
adopted the report on Singapore. 
</p>
<p>2. On 21 June 2010, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Singapore: Bahrain, Djibouti, Spain. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Singapore: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/11/SGP/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/SGP/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/SGP/3 and Corr.1). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, 
Denmark, Ireland, Latvia, Namibia, Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland 
and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to 
Singapore through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of UPR. 
</p>
<p><b>I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. In its opening statement, Singapore affirmed that it was committed to the promotion 
and protection of human rights and had worked hard to improve the lives of its people.  
Singaporeans were now better educated, better connected and informed, better housed, and 
led longer and healthier lives, with greater dignity and far wider life choices than at 
independence in 1965. 
</p>
<p>6. While there was still room for improvement, substantial progress had been made in 
the relatively short history of Singapore. Progress had been based on some fundamental and 
interrelated principles. 
</p>
<p>7. The first principle was balance. Rights implied obligations. Trade-offs between 
different kinds of rights were inevitable. While everyone must adhere to a universal 
standard of human rights, the interpretation and implementation of rights could not be 
divorced from their societal context and would evolve as society evolved. 
</p>
<p>8. The second principle was prioritization. As a small, multiracial and densely 
populated city State, social harmony formed the vital and irreplaceable foundation of the 
country&#8217;s survival and development.  If social cohesion was ruptured, it could not be easily 
restored. Hence Singapore prioritized social harmony above other values. 
</p>

<p>example that, after independence, English had been chosen as the working language of 
Singapore, even though it was not native to its Malay, Chinese and Indian population. Some 
limits on certain freedoms had to be accepted in order to live in harmony. For example, 
Singapore moderated the loudness of calls to prayer from mosques as well as the size of 
joss sticks that Buddhists and Taoists burned in public. To maintain equilibrium, Singapore 
had to make difficult choices between one right and another right and make adjustments at 
the margins. 
</p>
<p>10. The fourth principle was meritocracy. As a small country with no natural resources 
except its people, Singapore had to bring out the best in every person, regardless of gender, 
race or any other criteria. For those who faced socio-economic disadvantages at the outset, 
Government assistance schemes helped to put them on an even footing. 
</p>
<p>11. The final principle was effective governance, without which no other right could be 
realized. Good governance formed the foundation of the country&#8217;s progress and stability 
and was built upon democratic accountability and the rule of law, a long-term orientation 
and social justice. 
</p>
<p>12. The Government achieved social justice through equal treatment of all groups and 
heavily subsidized social infrastructure to facilitate social mobility, rather than social 
welfare. Singapore believed that the best way to empower people was to provide them with 
the capacity to look after themselves. For the vulnerable, who, despite their best efforts, 
were unable to improve on their situations, the Government provided targeted assistance. 
</p>
<p>13. At the international level, effective governance meant that Singapore took its 
international obligations seriously. Thus, Singapore would only sign on to a treaty when it 
was absolutely sure that it could implement it. Singapore should be able to accede to the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by 2012. 
</p>
<p>14. Singapore was constantly evolving and adapting to improve its unique society. The 
balance of rights and obligations would need to be guided by the interests of its people and 
the constraints of Singaporean geography, size and society. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>15. During the interactive dialogue, 54 delegations made statements. A number of 
delegations thanked Singapore for its constructive participation, openness and willingness 
to cooperate in the universal periodic review process and acknowledged its efforts in the 
promotion and protection of human rights. Active dialogue with civil society during the 
preparation of the national report was positively noted. Additional statements which could 
not be delivered during the interactive dialogue owing to time constraints were posted on 
the Extranet of the universal periodic review where available.1 Recommendations made 
during the dialogue are to be found in chapter II of the present report.

</p>
<p>45. <b> </b>Singapore stated that the Government was committed to looking after all 
Singaporeans and recognized the particular needs of various groups of society, including 
children, women, persons with disabilities and the elderly, aiming to empower all to uplift 
themselves and be self-reliant. Singapore was committed to its obligations under the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Discrimination against Women as evidenced by the concrete progress made in protecting 
and advancing the status and outcomes of these groups. 
</p>
<p>46. Singapore addressed questions raised regarding children. On compulsory education, 
Singapore explained that all children, including those with disabilities, had access to quality 
education. Those with severe disabilities, who could not attend mainstream schools, 
attended special education schools, overseen by the Ministry of Education. On the age of 
criminal responsibility, Singapore gave assurances that its laws took into account maturity 
of understanding for child offenders aged between 7 and 12. The juvenile justice system 
was restorative and enabled early intervention. On corporal punishment, Singapore 
emphasized positive forms of discipline. Hence, corporal punishment was not common and 
was only conducted as a last resort with strict regulations, guidelines and procedures. 
</p>
<p>47. Singapore assured that it regularly reviewed its reservations and declarations on the 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women, and was, for instance, reviewing the scope of its 
reservations to the latter. Singapore believed in equal opportunities for men and women on 
the basis of meritocracy. The equality of all persons before the law was enshrined in article 
12 of the Constitution. The rights of women were also protected by other legislation such as 
the Employment Act, the Penal Code and the Women&#8217;s Charter. 
</p>

<p>49. Singapore stressed that it had comprehensive laws protecting women. On sexual 
harassment, Singapore had laws that could be used to prosecute such acts in appropriate 
cases. On marital rape, changes had recently been made to the Penal Code to protect 
women whose marriages were on the verge of breakdown or had broken down. 
</p>
<p>50. Singapore reiterated its commitment to protecting religious freedom for all. No one 
was disadvantaged on the basis of race, language or religion. Racial and religious harmony 
was upheld through a combination of institutional, community-based and legal measures. 
</p>
<p>51. Singapore explained its emphasis on social security and assistance through health 
care, public housing, compulsory savings through the Central Provident Fund, and 
Workfare. It had established a Community Care Endowment Fund in 2005 to provide 
sustainable funding for programmes for low-income Singaporeans. That served as the final 
social safety net for those facing financial hardship. 
</p>
<p>52. Recognizing the challenges of an ageing population, Singapore had established a 
Ministerial Committee on Ageing. It was committed to ensuring employability and 
financial security, holistic and affordable health care and elder care, ageing-in-place, and 
active ageing. On disability issues, its comprehensive and multi-stakeholder 2007&#8211;2011 
Enabling Masterplan emphasized early intervention, education, employment opportunities, 
community-based services and programmes for care-givers. 
</p>
<p>53. On migrant workers, Singapore assured that it took the well-being of migrant 
workers very seriously through regular reviews of legislation, effective enforcement and 
regular education and outreach. For example, recruitment regulations were recently 
tightened to reduce exploitation by employment agencies. Employers were also required to 
provide proper housing, adequate rest and medical treatment and pay promised salaries.  
These efforts were coordinated by a ministerial steering committee. Specific measures to 
address the vulnerability of migrant domestic workers included higher maximum penalties 
under the Penal Code, and extensive coverage of rights under the Employment of Foreign 
Manpower Act, taking into account the particular working conditions of migrant workers. 
</p>
<p>54. On restricting foreign domestic workers from marrying Singaporeans and requiring 
regular medical examinations, given its space constraints, Singapore could not afford to 
absorb large numbers of migrants on a permanent basis. Migrant workers were provided 
with the full legal protection they needed to earn a living. However, most migrant workers 
were aware that they went to Singapore to work, and not to put down roots or settle down 
for good. 
</p>
<p>55. Singapore expressed its commitment to combating trafficking in persons, 
highlighting its four &#8216;P&#8217; approach &#8211; effective prevention, active prosecution, victim 
protection and proactive problem-solving with foreign counterparts and NGOs. In 
particular, Singapore clarified that trafficking victims were not prosecuted for immigration 
or other offences. Procedures were in place to determine whether the individual was a 
trafficking victim. If so, they would be assisted by a dedicated unit specially trained to 
identify and help victims of sex trafficking. Singapore had set up an inter-agency taskforce 
to develop a national plan of action and was exploring accession to the Protocol to Prevent, 
Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, 
supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and 
the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, 
child prostitution and child pornography. 
</p>
<p>56.<b> </b>Kazakhstan noted achievements made by Singapore in ensuring stability, equality 
and social justice and referred to its priority of maintaining racial and religious harmony. It 
commended Singapore for encouraging active citizenry and launching a government 
agency in that regard. It also commended Singapore for abiding by its treaty commitments. 
Kazakhstan made a recommendation. </p>


<p>57.<b> </b>Slovenia<b> </b>welcomed the commitment of the Government to improving protection of 
vulnerable groups, including the disabled and elderly. Slovenia commended Singapore for 
ensuring peaceful coexistence for its people. It noted that freedoms of assembly and 
expression had been curtailed to a considerable extent in order to achieve that, and that 
there were considerable restrictions on public discourse on issues of ethnicity, language, 
race, religion and politically sensitive issues. Slovenia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>58.<b> </b>Finland commended Singaporean efforts to promote good governance, rule of law 
and to prevent and combat corruption. It welcomed the invitation extended to the Special 
Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance and encouraged further such invitations. It asked if Singapore was going to take 
action to ratify other core international human rights treaties and if it was considering steps 
to comply with international human rights norms regarding the death penalty. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59.<b> </b>Timor-Leste commended Singapore for its achievements in delivering high 
economic and social development for its citizens, developing its human capital and

establishment of a national human rights institution. Timor-Leste made recommendations.

security. Cuba made recommendations.

child victims of exploitation. Egypt made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>68.<b> </b>Honduras noted Singaporean commitment to the protection of human rights and 
highlighted its education system, health system and the protection provided to victims of 
trafficking. It shared the concern of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women that women and girls who are victims of trafficking should not be punished 
for migratory infractions. It also noted Singaporean efforts to improve the situation of 
foreign domestic workers. It asked about ratification of the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. 
</p>
<p>69.<b> </b>Ghana applauded Singapore for the improvement of the standard of living of its 
population. It noted with interest its economic and social progress and commended its 
commitment to the promotion of social and cultural rights. It praised the comprehensive 
education and health systems of Singapore. It noted positively the high employment rate in 
Singapore, as well as the initiatives to promote the advancement of women&#8217;s rights. Ghana 
made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>70.<b> </b>Swaziland noted that the Singapore Constitution enshrined a range of fundamental 
liberties and imposed on the Government the responsibility to protect indigenous peoples. It 
noted Singapore insisted on rule of law to ensure stability, equality and social justice. It 
commended Singapore for its ratification of international human rights instruments, for its 
sophisticated economy, educational and health systems. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>71.<b> </b>Japan<b> </b>commended numerous achievements made towards guaranteeing the social 
rights of the people as attested to by the high rate of education and low unemployment. 
However, Japan was concerned about the situation of foreign workers, particularly foreign 
domestic workers. It emphasized the importance of ensuring a free flow of information to 
promote the diversity of ideas fundamental to democracy, noting that the media were 
heavily regulated. Japan inquired about efforts made to ensure freedom of the press. Japan 
made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>72.<b> </b>France deplored that the death penalty still existed in Singapore, as well as the lack 
of transparency of executions and convictions. It noted positively that Singapore planned to 
accede to several human rights instruments. It was concerned about the absence of a 
provision guaranteeing gender equality in the Constitution. It welcomed that the provision 
of the Penal Code criminalizing homosexuality was no longer applied. France regretted that 
caning was still considered a punishment. France made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>73.<b> </b>Switzerland welcomed Singaporean efforts to maintain peaceful coexistence among 
its diverse communities. It expressed concern over the use of corporal punishment in the 
education system. It also expressed concern that Singaporeans&#8217; right to express their 
opinions peacefully and to participate in public life was limited. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>74.<b> </b>Poland acknowledged the cooperation of Singapore with special procedures. It noted 
with concern that Singapore was still not a party to a number of core human rights treaties.  </p>


<p>It welcomed efforts undertaken to protect the rights of children and expressed concerns 
about the lack of full implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Poland 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>75.<b> </b>The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland<b> </b>welcomed the country&#8217;s 
agreement to the establishment of an ASEAN human rights mechanism. It also welcomed 
the decision in 2008 to allow at least one space for free assembly and expression in 
Singapore, at Speaker&#8217;s Corner. The Untied Kingdom considered that Singapore could be a 
leading nation in upholding democracy and human rights as well as leading in economic 
activities. It hoped for progress in the area of freedom of expression and regarding abolition 
of the death penalty. United Kingdom made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>76.<b> </b>Trinidad and Tobago referred to the importance attached by Singapore to the 
maintenance of social and political stability, as well as its commitment to protect human 
rights, as exemplified by its accession to various human rights instruments. Trinidad and 
Tobago commended welfare achievements, especially in education, health, gender equality 
and the rights of persons with disabilities. Trinidad and Tobago made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>77.<b> </b>Iraq<b> </b>appreciated efforts in continuing to improve the protection to all special groups 
in the country and welcomed successes in improving living standard, including through 
efforts in child protection and laws and programmes to support equality between men and 
women. This demonstrated the will of the Government to promote and protect human 
rights, always with respect for religious and ethnic diversity. Iraq encouraged Singapore to 
request technical assistance from the international community to further promote human 
rights on the ground. Iraq made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>78.<b> </b>Jordan<b> </b>commended Singapore for its sincere and ongoing efforts to further promote 
and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms. Jordan noted efforts to strengthen the 
institutional framework, including through the establishment of bodies such as the national 
Family Council, the Central Youth Guidance Office and the Office of Public Guardian. 
Jordan was confident that Singapore was considering the feasibility of accession to several 
international instruments. Jordan made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>79.<b> </b>Afghanistan acknowledged positive developments for the protection of human rights 
in Singapore and made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>80.<b> </b>Lebanon<b> </b>commended the achievements in the area of human development and 
especially in the areas of education and health-care system. While acknowledging that some 
challenges still lay ahead, Lebanon asked about steps taken or envisaged to ensure basic 
rights for domestic workers, and about steps to ensure women could enjoy equal rights to 
men in the field of employment. 
</p>
<p>81.<b> </b>Singapore, in response to questions on preventive detention, affirmed that it was 
used only as a last resort in very exceptional circumstances, and with appropriate 
procedural safeguards. For example, the detainee had the right to know the case against him 
and to make representations against his detention, with the aid of legal counsel, to an 
independent committee. The judiciary could verify compliance with the procedural 
safeguards. On a question as to why judicial review under the Internal Security Act was 
limited to procedural questions, it was noted that matters of national security were not 
justiciable in many jurisdictions. All detainees were treated in a humane manner and could 
receive regular family visits and access rehabilitative programmes. Preventive detention 
laws were important to address security challenges against which standard law and order 
responses were often unsuitable, such as crimes with organized elements and terrorist 
activities. 
</p>
<p>82. On the issue of sexual orientation, Singapore affirmed that all individuals were free 
to pursue their lifestyles, and recognition and success were based on merit. Lesbian, gay, </p>


<p>bisexual and transgender persons did not have to hide their sexual orientation for fear of 
losing their jobs or for fear of prosecution. Any person unfairly dismissed had legal 
recourse. On the issue of whether to decriminalize certain homosexual acts, that had been 
debated extensively, including in parliament but the decision had been taken to retain the 
status quo. Much of Singapore remained conservative, a fact which could not be changed 
by legislation alone. It was noted however that the police did not proactively enforce the 
provision unless other laws such as on indecent public behaviour or paedophilia were 
broken. 
</p>
<p>83. On the question of women prisoners, Singapore assured that measures were in place 
to protect their safety and acknowledge their special needs. Singapore would continue 
efforts to ensure a gender-sensitive approach. 
</p>
<p>84. On questions concerning freedom of peaceful assembly and association, Singapore 
explained that, in deciding the optimal balance between the exercise of political rights and 
stability, stability had to be given greater weight given that Singapore was a diverse and 
densely-populated city. Cause-related assemblies were generally regulated by permits. 
There was also a simple and transparent registration process for societies. Rejections were 
exceptional. This created a social climate in which civil society could flourish peacefully.   
</p>
<p>85. On media freedom, Singapore noted that freedom of speech was constitutionally 
guaranteed. As a knowledge-based economy, local media only formed part of the 
cosmopolitan and vibrant press scene of Singapore. Singapore was also one of the most 
connected countries in the world. The issue was really one of responsible press. The 
media&#8217;s role as a neutral forum, which reported fully and fairly, underpinned the country&#8217;s 
regulatory framework. Where newspapers had been sued, they had been sued for civil 
defamation and contempt. These actions were commonplace in common-law countries. 
Media freedom in a healthy democracy should not allow for scurrilous allegations of 
political corruption or judicial bias, or lies that denigrated character and reputation. 
Newspapers had not been prosecuted for criminal defamation in the 40 years since 
Singaporean independence. 
</p>
<p>86. On a question regarding the regulation of speech on racial and religious matters, the 
approach of Singapore was to use moral suasion, framed within the rule of law. The law 
was used only as a last resort. 
</p>
<p>87. On the issue of capital punishment, Singapore reiterated the absence of international 
consensus for or against capital punishment, including mandatory capital punishment. 
Singapore viewed the death penalty as a criminal justice issue. Capital punishment was 
only imposed for the most serious crimes, after due judicial process, and in accordance with 
the law. It was supported by the majority of Singaporeans. Singapore had one of the lowest 
homicide and heroin abuse rates in the world. Statistics on executions were published. 
</p>
<p>88. Singapore emphasized that its use of corporal punishment was within internationally 
accepted norms. Corporal punishment was only available for a specified list of serious 
crimes, and was not lightly imposed. Its imposition was subject to clear restrictions and 
conditions. On a question related to immigration offenders, Singapore noted that, due to its 
small size, it would be unwise to turn a blind eye to those who entered and remained in the 
country illegally. In 1989, when the Government had offered amnesty before a new law 
regarding corporal punishment for immigration offences entered into force, more than 
12,000 people had turned themselves in. 
</p>
<p>89. Concerning suggestions for the establishment of an independent human rights 
institution, Singapore assured that it was firmly committed to the effective implementation 
of human rights at home through overlapping and mutually reinforcing forms of protection. 
Although Singapore was not currently party to any instruments that provided for individual 
communications procedures, legal remedies were available in appropriate cases through </p>


<p>Singapore courts. Legal redress was supplemented by appropriate non-legal measures 
provided by both the public and private sectors. There were also existing inter-agency 
consultative mechanisms on human rights. At the regional level, Singapore worked closely 
with ASEAN, in particular through its Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights 
and the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Women and 
Children. Through such mechanisms, Singapore shared its best practices and learned about 
ways to enhance rights protection. 
</p>
<p>90. Concerning a question on extending a standing invitation to special procedures, 
Singapore noted that it had received a number of visits, including by the Special Rapporteur 
on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 
in 2010. Singapore was open to further discussions, and visit requests would be considered 
on the merits of each proposal. It had also provided responses to questionnaires and 
communications from special procedures. 
</p>
<p>91. Regarding an independent electoral commission, Singapore noted that the crux of 
the issue was whether there was an agency that conducted its business in a fair and 
transparent manner and was trusted by the public. In the case of Singapore, that was the 
Elections Department, run by civil servants who carried out their work objectively and in 
accordance with the law. Civil servants were appointed and promoted according to civil 
service rules, so that they would be impartial in carrying out their duties, without fear of 
political interference. 
</p>
<p>92. Lastly, Singapore assured that the Government would continue to engage civil 
society in the follow-up after the universal periodic review, as it had in the preparation of 
the national report. As regards accession to further human rights treaties, the focus of 
Singapore was on the full and effective implementation of treaty obligations. Singapore 
emphasized that non-accession to a particular treaty did not mean that in practice its 
policies were not already largely in compliance with its provisions. Singapore confirmed its 
intention to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities next year and 
to consider other instruments, including the International Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography and ILO conventions. 
</p>
<p>93. Singapore appreciated the opportunity to engage in the review process and thanked 
all delegations for their comments and recommendations. Those would be considered in a 
positive spirit, with due regard to the needs of social harmony and the aspirations of its 
people. 
</p>
