<p><b>  20</b>/&#8230;<b> Elimination of discrimination against women 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Guided </i>by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided also </i>by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted on 25 June 
1993 by the World Conference on Human Rights, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for 
Action, adopted on 15 September 1995 by the Fourth World Conference on Women, and 
their review conferences in 2005 and 2010, the Durban Declaration and Programme of 
Action, adopted on 8 September 2001 by the World Conference against Racism, Racial 
Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, and the outcome document of the 
Durban Review Conference, adopted on 24 April 2009, 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><i>Recalling also </i>Commission on Human Rights resolutions 2000/13 of 17 April 2000, 
2001/34 of 23 April 2001 and 2003/22 of 22 April 2003, as well as Council resolution 6/30 
of 14 December 2007 on integrating the human rights of women throughout the United 
Nations system, and Council resolution<b>s </b>12/17 of 2 October 2009 and 15/23 of 1 October 
2010 on the elimination of discrimination against women, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind </i>that international human rights treaties, including the Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights, prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender and include guarantees 
to ensure the enjoyment by women and men, and girls and boys, of their civil, political, 
economic, social and cultural rights on a basis of equality, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned </i>by the fact that women everywhere are still subject to significant 
disadvantage as the result of discriminatory laws and practices and that de jure and de facto 
equality has not been achieved in any country in the world, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>that women face multiple forms of discrimination, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also </i>that the full and equal participation of women in all spheres of life 
is essential for the full and complete economic, political and social development of a 
country, 
</p>
<p><i>Mindful </i>of the fact that the elimination of discrimination against women requires the 
consideration of women&#8217;s  specific socio-economic context, and recognizing that laws, 
policies, customs and traditions that restrict women&#8217;s equal access to full participation in 
</p>
<p>development processes and public and political life are discriminatory and may contribute 
to the feminization of poverty, 
</p>
<p><i>Mindful also </i>that women and girls are over half of the population in the world, that 
equal rights and opportunities are key in achieving sustainable economic, political and 
social development and lasting solutions to global challenges , and that gender equality 
benefits women, men, girls and boys in society as a whole, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind </i>the challenges still faced by all countries throughout the world to 
overcome inequality between men and women,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Reiterating the need</i> to intensify efforts  to eliminate all forms of discrimination 
against women throughout the world,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Acknowledging<b> </b></i>the work undertaken by the United Nations Entity for Gender 
Equality and the Empowerment of Women, the Commission on the Status of Women, the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the special procedures 
mandate holders of the Council on violence against women, its causes and consequences, 
on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, and on contemporary forms of 
slavery, and other relevant United Nations bodies, agencies and mechanisms to eliminate 
discrimination in law and in practice throughout the world, and noting the work undertaken 
by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the issue, 
</p>
<p><i>Considering<b> </b></i>that periods of political transition provide a unique opportunity to 
advance women&#8217;s equal participation and representation in economic, political and social 
</p>
<p>spheres,<b> 
</b></p>
<p>1. <i>Acknowledges </i>the initial work undertaken<b> </b>by the Working Group on the issue 
of discrimination against women in law and in practice, and takes note<b> </b>of its first report;1 
</p>

<p>2. <i>Recognizes </i>the constructive approach of the Working Group and calls upon 
it, in the discharge of its mandate, to maintain such an approach and dialogue with States to 
address the elimination of discrimination against women in law and in practice in all 
spheres from the perspective of States&#8217; obligations under international human rights law, 
</p>
<p>taking into account the good practices that have been transformative in different contexts 
and in the light of the different realities that women face; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Welcomes<b> </b></i>the thematic priorities identified by the Working Group, namely, 
political and public life, economic and social life, family and cultural life, and health and 
safety; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Requests </i>the Working Group to give special attention, in the discharge of its 
mandate, to the importance of the right to education as key to the empowerment of women 
and girls in all spheres as well as for ensuring equality and non-discrimination; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Also requests </i>the Working Group, in the discharge of its mandate, to dedicate 
specific attention to good practices that have contributed to mobilizing society as a whole, 
including men and boys <b>, </b>in the elimination of discrimination against women; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Further requests </i>the Working Group, in the discharge of its mandate, to offer 
support to States&#8217; initiatives to address multiple forms of discrimination against women 
</p>
<p>when implementing their obligations as State parties to relevant international human rights 
treaties with regard to civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights, and related 
commitments where applicable; 
</p>
<p>7.<i> Affirms </i>that supporting the empowerment of women in all spheres is 
necessary to bring about equality; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Emphasizes </i>the significant role that women play in economic development 
and in the eradication of poverty, and stresses the need to promote equal pay for equal work 
or work of equal value, to promote the recognition of the value of women&#8217;s unremunerated 
work, as well as to develop and promote policies that facilitate the reconciliation of 
employment and family responsibilities; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Calls upon </i>States to ensure full representation and full and equal 
participation of women in political, social and economic decision-making as an essential 
condition for gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls , and a critical 
factor in the eradication of poverty; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Calls upon </i>all States to cooperate with and assist the Working Group in its <b> 
</b>task, to supply all necessary available information requested by it and to give serious <b> 
</b>consideration to responding favourably to its requests to visit their country to enable it to 
fulfil its mandate effectively; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Invites </i>relevant United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, treaty <b> 
</b>bodies and civil society actors, including non-governmental organizations, as well as the<b> 
</b>private sector, to cooperate fully with the Working Group in the fulfilment of its mandate; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Decides </i>to continue consideration of this question in conformity with the 
annual programme of work of the Human Rights Council.<b>
