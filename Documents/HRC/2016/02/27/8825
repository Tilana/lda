</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 On 5 and 6 November 2009, the Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
human rights of internally displaced persons carried out a visit to the Tskhinvali 
Region/South Ossetia to follow up on his mission to Georgia in October 2008. The 
Representative had access to all the areas that he requested to see, including Tskhinvali, 
Akhalgori District and Znauri District, and held open and frank consultations with the 
South Ossetian de facto authorities. 
 As a result of the August 2008 conflict, 19,381 people were internally displaced 
across the de facto border, while an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 were internally displaced 
within the Tskhinvali Region/South Ossetia. Only very few internally displaced persons 
have been able to return to the Tskhinvali Region/South Ossetia, and of those displaced 
within South Ossetia, many still await reconstruction of their houses.  
 Much of the displacement was caused or followed by violations of international 
humanitarian law committed by the parties to the conflict. The Representative is 
particularly concerned about the deliberate destruction and looting of ethnic Georgian 
villages in areas where tensions were high before the conflict. Furthermore, he noted with 
concern the high degree of destruction of civilian houses and structures in Tskhinvali, 
which was also caused by the use of weapons that have an indiscriminate effect in urban 
areas.

<p> The Representative urges the parties to ensure that all persons displaced by the 
recent and past conflicts are able to enjoy their right to return voluntarily to their former 
homes in safety and dignity, and can recover their property and possessions, or obtain 
compensation. In this context, the Representative urges the South Ossetian de facto 
authorities not to link political demands with the right to return. In the light of the complex 
housing, land and property situation in the former Soviet Republic, caused by several 
waves of violence and displacement, the Representative recommends that a special 
property resolution mechanism involving international expertise be established. 
</p>
<p> Until a comprehensive and durable solution to the conflict is found, the parties 
should come to pragmatic agreements to improve the situation of internally displaced 
persons and other conflict-affected populations. The Representative is particularly 
concerned about the hardships caused by the almost total closure of the administrative 
boundary line. Furthermore, the laws and policies adopted by the parties to the conflict 
effectively deny humanitarian actors access to the Tskhinvali Region/South Ossetia, thus 
preventing them from providing much needed assistance, in particular with regard to 
housing for the most vulnerable. The Representative calls on the parties to allow and 
facilitate access from all sides so that the most suitable, safe and economical route can be 
used to deliver humanitarian assistance. 
</p>
<p> There is still a group of 3,500 internally displaced people in collective centres in 
Tskhinvali/South Ossetia, who were displaced during the 1991&#8211;1992 conflict. The South 
Ossetian de facto authorities and other actors should initiate housing and livelihood 
programmes that allow these internally displaced persons to normalize their living 
situation, without this having implications for their right to return or restitution of their 
property.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. From 5 to 6 November 2009, the Representative, pursuant to his mandate contained 
in Human Rights Council resolution 6/32, carried out a visit to the Tskhinvali Region/South 
Ossetia to follow up on the mission to Georgia he conducted in October 2008 (see 
A/HRC/10/13/Add.2). The Representative&#8217;s conclusions and recommendations in the 
present report are based on the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement.1 The Guiding 
Principles are recognized by States as an important international framework for the 
protection of internally displaced persons2 and are to be observed by all authorities, groups 
and persons irrespective of their legal status.3 
</p>
<p>2. The Representatives would like to thank all sides for the flexibility they have shown 
in allowing him to access the Tskhinvali Region/South Ossetia.4 The Representative 
enjoyed access to all places he requested to see, including Tskhinvali and surrounding 
villages, Znauri district and Akhalgori (also known as Leningori). He also held open and 
frank discussion with the South Ossetian de facto authorities, including Mr. Boris 
Chochiev, &#8220;Plenipotentiary Representative of the President of the Republic of South 
Ossetia on Post-Conflict Settlement Matters&#8221;, Mr. Murat Djioev, &#8220;Minister of Foreign 
Affairs of the Republic of South Ossetia&#8221;, and Mr. Konstantin Kochiev, &#8220;Advisor to the 
President of the Republic of South Ossetia&#8221;. He also briefed the Government of Georgia on 
his findings and discussions upon his return from the Tskhinvali Region/South Ossetia. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Patterns of internal displacement in and from the Tskhinvali 
Region/South Ossetia 
</b>3. An estimated 10,000&#8211;15,000 persons, the majority ethnic Ossetians, were displaced 
within Tskhinvali Region/South Ossetia as a result of the August 2008 conflict. 5 According 
to the Georgian Civil Registry, 19,381 persons, mainly ethnic Georgians, have been 
displaced from the Tskhinvali Region/South Ossetia across the administrative boundary 
line.  
</p>
<p>4. According the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, internally displaced 
persons are persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to 
leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to 
avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human 
rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally 
recognized State border. Given that the de facto border has not received full international

 In comments to a draft version of this report, the Government of Georgia acknowledged the efforts of 
</p>
<p>the Representative who had tried to access the region from Gori and highlighted that it gave its 
consent to the &#8220;Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit to the Tskhinvali Region/South Ossetia from the north, that 
is through the Georgian-Russian state border.&#8221;

<p>recognition as a State border,6 the Representative considers all persons who were displaced 
across the administrative boundary line to be internally displaced persons. 
</p>
<p>5. In addition, many of the estimated 5000 persons who were internally displaced 
within the Tskhinvali Region/South Ossetia as a result of the 1991&#8211;1992 armed conflict7 
have yet to find a durable solution. These include 3,500 persons who have spent the last 17 
years in collective centres according to figures provided by the South Ossetian de facto 
authorities. 
</p>
<p>6. The findings based on visits to a number of locations suggest that, while many 
civilians fled the general effects of armed conflict and insecurity, there are also clear 
indications that arbitrary displacement and other displacement-related violations of 
international humanitarian law were committed by parties to the conflict.8 
</p>
<p><b> A. Destruction of houses in and around Tskhinvali as a result of conduct of 
hostilities 
</b></p>
<p>7. The armed conflict of August 2008 has destroyed or severely damaged many 
civilian houses and a number of civilian public installations in Tskhinvali, including the 
university, the parliament and the main hospital. According to figures provided by the 
South Ossetian de facto authorities, 680 houses in Tskhinvali and surrounding villages were 
destroyed and over 1000 damaged. This includes a small settlement of 15 houses in Tbet 
village on the outskirts of Tskhinvali that UNHCR had built for some of the displaced from 
the 1991&#8211;1992 armed conflict. At the time of the Representative&#8217;s visit, almost 15 months 
after the conflict, only 200 houses had been reconstructed and several thousand persons 
were facing a second winter in displacement.  
</p>
<p>8. Reports indicate that the large number of civilian houses destroyed also resulted 
from the use of weaponry in urban and other populated areas that was not accurate enough 
to discriminate between military and civilian targets.9 These include in particular GRAD 
multiple rocket launchers used by the Georgian military forces during the fighting in and 
around Tskhinvali. The Representative also takes note of reports that cluster munitions 
were used by the Georgian and the Russian armed forces.10 The use of cluster munitions has 
a long-term effect on internally displaced persons and other affected populations since 
unexploded remnants not only pose grave safety risks, but may deprive people of the 
opportunity to return to their homes or access their fields and other properties that their 
livelihood depends on. 
</p>
<p>9. International humanitarian law prohibits the use of indiscriminate attacks that are not 
directed at a specific military target, employ means of combat which cannot be directed at a 
specific military objective or have effects which cannot be limited as required by 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>

 When this report was finalized, only the Russian Federation, Nauru, Nicaragua and Venezuela had 
</p>
<p>recognized an independent &#8220;Republic of South Ossetia&#8221;.

<p>international humanitarian law, and consequently strike military objectives and civilians or 
civilian objects without distinction.11 Indiscriminate attacks may constitute grave breaches 
of international humanitarian law.12 
</p>
<p><b> B. Deliberate destruction of villages around Tskhinvali 
</b></p>
<p>10. In the aftermath of the armed conflict, a number of ethnic Georgian villages and 
settlements were systematically destroyed and pillaged. Due to shelling from surrounding 
areas in the days before major hostilities commenced on 7/8 August 2008 most of the 
population had already fled the villages. However, a few inhabitants remained in their 
houses and were driven out by force. The perpetrators were reportedly South Ossetian 
militia, aided by other armed elements, civilians and, in some instances, also Russian 
soldiers who either directly participated or failed to intervene.13 It appears that primarily 
those villages and settlements were targeted, where tensions were high before the conflict, 
in particular also because they were supporting the &#8220;provisional administration in South 
Ossetia&#8221; of Dimitri Sanakoyev. 
</p>
<p>11. In the Didi Liakhvi valley, along the road north of Tskhinvali, the Representative 
saw seven adjacent villages, which had been inhabited by an almost exclusively Georgian 
population prior to the August 2008 conflict. They had been completely destroyed, making 
a return of the former inhabitants in the near future physically impossible. The type and 
extent of destruction suggest that the buildings in these villages were deliberately destroyed 
by setting fire or detonating explosives. The Representative also found clear indications that 
the villages had been systematically looted. Reports indicate that South Ossetian militia 
destroyed and looted the villages after most of the inhabitants had fled.14 
</p>
<p>12. South Ossetian interlocutors acknowledged that the villages were destroyed as a 
result of &#8220;mutual hatred&#8221; rather than fighting. They highlighted that these villages used to 
have a considerable ethnic Ossetian minority population which was arbitrarily displaced by 
the majority population during the 1991&#8211;1992 conflict.  
</p><p>13. Furthermore, the Representative observed that the formerly ethnic Georgian quarter 
of Prisi village, east of Tskhinvali, had been systematically destroyed. At least two houses 
bore graffiti inscriptions with Ossetian names, presumably an indication that these houses 
were claimed to be the property of ethnic Ossetians. 
</p>
<p>14. Other reports received, corroborated by satellite images analysed by UNOSAT 
experts, indicate that ethnic Georgian villages and settlements in the Patara Liakhvi valley 
(including Eredvi, Vanati, Disevi, Beloti, Satskheneti, and Atsriskhevi) were also 
deliberately destroyed and looted by members of South Ossetian militias and civilians.15 
Due to time constraints, the Representative was not able to visit the Patara Liakhvi valley.

<p>15. Pillaging and the extensive and deliberate destruction of civilian property without 
military justification constitute grave breaches of international humanitarian law.16 Military 
forces, which have established control over a territory, are required to uphold law and order 
and prevent breaches of international humanitarian law committed by members of their 
own forces or other persons under their control.17 
</p>
<p><b> C. Displacement from Akhalgori District 
</b></p>
<p>16. Akhalgori District, also known by its former Soviet name of Leningori, has 
traditionally had a majority ethnic Georgian population and was under the control of the 
Government of Georgia prior to the August 2008 conflict. While the District saw no 
fighting, many fled across the administrative boundary line after Russian armed forces 
entered the District on 20 August 2008. Another large group of persons left Akhalgori in 
October 2008, fearing to become entrapped in the economically marginalized area in case 
the administrative boundary line would be closed. Since then the situation of the civilian 
population in Akhalgori has further worsened as the supply of gas and often also electricity 
from across the administrative boundary line has been cut off. According to the Georgian 
Civil Registry the official figure of internally displaced persons from Akhalgori stands at 
5,348 persons. 
</p>
<p>17. Although the local de facto administration had no up-to-date population figures, the 
absence of a large part of the population is visible. Many houses were deserted and boarded 
up. The Representative was informed that only 120 children attended the two Georgian-
language schools in Akhalgori, which are reportedly still operational; another 60 are 
enrolled in the Russian-language school. 
</p>
<p>18. During his visit to Akhalgori town, the Representative was encouraged to note that 
no houses were destroyed and there were no visible traces of looting. The Representatives 
is aware of reports suggesting that armed forces and militia have created a &#8220;climate of fear&#8221; 
in the town leading to further displacement.18 While the Representative noted during his 
visit that a militia presence is still visible in Akhalgori, some of the remaining ethnic 
Georgian inhabitants who spoke to the Representative&#8217;s delegation did not report serious 
problems or appear to be intimidated. 
</p>
<p>19. Contrary to other areas along the line of control, the local population in Akhalgori 
can cross the checkpoints along the administrative boundary line. The Representative was 
told that many of those who fled the town return from time to time to harvest or collect 
salaries to the extent that they remain on public payrolls. The Representative is concerned 
about allegations of acts of harassment and extortion of civilians crossing checkpoints, 
which are reportedly committed by individual soldiers on both sides.19

</p>
<p><b> D. Destruction of houses and displacement in Znauri District 
</b></p>
<p>20. Znauri District, in particular Znauri town, was directly affected by the armed 
conflict. According to the local de facto administration, 40&#8211;45 houses were destroyed and 
130 damaged in areas that were under South Ossetian control before the August 2008 
conflict. Many ethnic Georgians fled across the administrative boundary line with retreating 
Georgian forces, leaving mainly elderly persons behind. According to the local de facto 
administration, an estimated 1500 persons have been displaced during the conflict.  
</p>
<p>21. The ethnic Georgian villages of Avnevi and Nuli, which had been under Georgian 
control prior to the August 2008 conflict and were also integrated into paramilitary self-
defence structures, have been systematically destroyed.20 Local de facto administration 
officials acknowledged their destruction, while claiming that the fleeing inhabitants 
themselves had set houses on fire. Other reports based on testimony of victims, witnesses 
and independent observers indicate that the villages were deliberately destructed; some 
houses seem to have been burned down weeks after a ceasefire was concluded.21 
</p>
<p>22. Other villages, which had a majority ethnic Georgian population prior to the August 
2008 conflict, have not seen any visible destruction, although most of the ethnic Georgian 
population fled leaving often only elderly and vulnerable people behind. The 
Representative visited Okona, an ethnic Georgian village close to the administrative 
boundary line. The remaining inhabitants were almost exclusively elderly and vulnerable 
persons. Many lived in very dire conditions not least because they could no longer rely on 
the support of younger relatives who had fled and could not visit them as the checkpoints in 
the area are closed.  
</p>
<p>23. The Representative was encouraged to see that Arknet village retained a mixed 
ethnic Ossetian and Georgian population. The villagers explained that they chose not to 
engage in ethnically motivated acts of violence against each other despite pressure from 
different sides. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Key concerns relating to the displacement situation 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Representative had the opportunity to discuss key concerns in an open and frank 
manner with the South Ossetian de facto authorities. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Reconstruction and repair of conflict-affected houses and apartments 
</b></p>
<p>25. The reconstruction of houses has progressed far too slowly. As indicated above, the 
South Ossetian de facto authorities estimate that a total of 680 houses were destroyed in 
Tskhinvali and surrounding villages, while 1000 were damaged. At the time of the 
Representative&#8217;s visit, almost 15 months after the conflict, only 200 houses had been 
reconstructed. In Znauri District, where at least 40 houses were destroyed and 130 damaged 
the reconstruction of 10 houses had just started. As a result several thousand persons were 
facing a second winter in displacement. The Representative was informed that many among 
the displaced were either staying with friends or relatives in Tskhinvali Region/South 
Ossetia or found refuge in Northern Ossetia (Russian Federation). A small number of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>20
 An initial UNOSAT analysis of satellite images of 19 August 2009 indicated that all houses in the 
</p>
<p>two villages visible in the images were either destroyed or severely damaged. 
 
</p>
<p>21
 See, e.g. IIFMCG, Report: Vol. II (September 2009), at p. 399. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/21/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-10251 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>persons also lived in the basement of their houses or had set up transitional tent 
constructions on their property.  
</p>
<p>26. No efforts were visible to reconstruct the ethnic Georgian villages and settlements 
that were deliberately destroyed in the aftermath of the fighting. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Returns to and from South Ossetia 
</b></p>
<p>27. Internally displaced persons have a right to a durable solution of their choice, which 
includes the right to return to their home or place of habitual residence, to integrate locally 
or settle elsewhere in their own country.22 The Representative therefore welcomes the fact 
that his South Ossetian interlocutors recognized, in principle, that all internally displaced 
persons have a right to return, regardless of their ethnicity. At this point, however, the de 
facto authorities in Tskhinvali attach conditions to the right to return that are not in 
accordance with international human rights or the Guiding Principles on Internal 
Displacement since they tie exercise of the right to return to political demands.  
</p>
<p>28. The Representatives was told that returns would not be permitted until the 
Government of Georgia would agree to conclude an agreement on the non-use of force 
between the conflict parties. Furthermore, the South Ossetian de facto authorities 
underscored that returns would only take place to the extent that ethnic Ossetians could 
return to Georgian controlled areas. In addition, the de facto authorities maintained the 
position that returnees would have to accept to become citizens of the &#8220;Republic of South 
Ossetia&#8221; and that anyone who had been involved in combat activities on the Georgian side 
would be excluded from return.  
</p>
<p>29. The authorities also expressed concern about very visible and large-scale return 
operations fearing they would be abused for political purposes, while being more open to 
accept returns on an individual basis.  
</p>
<p>30. At the local level, there seems to be slightly more openness to allow returns on a 
case-by-case basis. The Representative was informed that, in the year following the 
ceasefire of August 2008, at least 340 persons have been reunited with their families on 
both sides of the administrative boundary line thanks to the facilitation of neutral 
intermediaries. Many of the returnees reportedly belong to ethnically mixed families or are 
elderly persons. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Freedom of movement across the administrative boundary line 
</b></p>
<p>31. At the time of the Representative&#8217;s visit, the administrative boundary line was closed 
except for Akhalgori. People who nevertheless move cross the administrative boundary 
line, for instance to visit relatives, attend funerals or to pursue essential livelihood 
activities, risk being arrested and detained on the northern side. On 20 October, for 
instance, 16 Georgian woodcutters were arrested in the area of Akhali Burguli and released 
only several days later. On 4 November 2009, four teenage boys were arrested and detained 
until their release in December 2009, following the intervention of the Commissioner for 
Human Rights of the Council of Europe. The Representative also received allegations about 
instances of border crossers being held for questioning by Georgian authorities. The 
Representative was encouraged to receive assurances from the Government of Georgia that 
persons living in the Tskhinvali Region/South Ossetia maintain their Georgian citizenship 
and have the right to move across the administrative boundary line.

</p>
<p>32. These practices unduly interfere with the rights of the displaced to freedom of 
movement, family life as well as various social and economic rights that are also reaffirmed 
by the Guiding Principles.23 The closure of the administrative boundary line affects 
internally displaced persons, but even more so those elderly and vulnerable persons who 
could not flee and stayed behind. They face enormous difficulties in the absence of their 
displaced relatives or neighbours on whose support they had relied in the past. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Access to international actors providing assistance and recovery 
support 
</b></p>
<p>33. Despite considerable support provided by the Russian Federation to the South 
Ossetian de facto authorities, a number of humanitarian needs of displaced and other 
vulnerable population remain to be addressed. In particular, the lack of progress on the 
reconstruction of housing for the most vulnerable among the displaced is a serious concern, 
also bearing in mind the cold winters in the region. 
</p>
<p>34. The Representative regrets the lack of flexibility shown by both sides to the conflict 
in providing access to international assistance and recovery support for the displaced. The 
South Ossetian de facto authorities continue to insist that international humanitarian 
agencies and assistance enter the territory solely from the territory of the Russian 
Federation. They highlighted that they would maintain this position, especially as long as 
no agreement on the non-use of force is concluded between the conflict parties. 
</p>
<p>35. On the basis of its Law on the Occupied Territory the Government of Georgia takes 
the position that access for humanitarian assistance to the Tskhinvali Region/South Ossetia 
may only be delivered from Gori, although exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case 
basis. While the Representative welcomes the fact that the Georgian Parliament was 
considering a number of amendments to the Law on Occupied Territory when this report 
was finalized, including an exception for delivery of emergency humanitarian assistance 
from the north, this would still not allow for the delivery of the type of non-emergency 
assistance that is currently needed.24 
</p>
<p>36. The Representative recalls Guiding Principle 25, according to which all authorities 
concerned shall grant and facilitate the free passage of humanitarian assistance and grant 
persons engaged in the provision of such assistance rapid and unimpeded access to the 
internally displaced. He urges the conflict parties to facilitate the provision of assistance 
through the most suitable, safest and economic routes, which would mean for some areas 
access from the South, for others from the North. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Normalization of the living situation of internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p>37. Until progress is made in finding a political solution to the conflict, it is unlikely that 
many of those displaced during the recent or past conflicts will be able or willing to 
permanently return across the administrative boundary line. It is therefore important to 
allow internally displaced persons to normalize and improve their living situation in the 
areas of their displacement. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>23

</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>38. The Representative has repeatedly emphasized that return and normalization of the 
living conditions of internally displaced persons are not mutually exclusive.25 Helping 
internally displaced persons to normalize their living situation avoids dependency 
syndromes and places internally displaced persons in a better situation to voluntarily return 
once this option becomes feasible. 
</p>
<p>39. The Representative has therefore welcomed the fact that, on 28 May 2009, the 
Government of Georgia, adopted the State Action Plan for the Implementation of the 
National Strategy on Internally Displaced Persons (Government Decree No 403). This Plan 
marks a paradigm shift and seeks to improve especially the housing conditions of those 
displaced in the recent or past conflicts who still live in collective centres.26 
</p>
<p>40. Similar efforts also have to be made in the Tskhinvali Region/South Ossetia. Most 
of the 3,500 persons who were displaced almost two decades ago still live in decrepit 
collective centres in Tskhinvali and its outskirts. The majority of these buildings were not 
designed for long-term residence and living conditions have steadily deteriorated over the 
years. Some collective centres were reportedly further damaged during the August 2008 
armed conflict. The Representative met with inhabitants of one visibly dilapidated 
collective centre, who highlighted their difficult living conditions in the overcrowded 
shelter. He notes with concern that there are hardly any programmes to help internally 
displaced persons find their own housing, gain employment and assume a normal life again. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Protection and restitution of housing, land and property 
</b></p>
<p>41. All internally displaced persons from the recent and past conflicts are entitled to 
restitution or compensation for their property, regardless of whether they choose to return, 
integrate locally or resettle. Their property needs to be protected against unlawful 
appropriation, occupation and use by the relevant authorities.27 
</p>
<p>42. While reiterating his concerns about illegal occupation of property of ethnic 
Ossetians displaced from places on the Tblisi side of the administrative boundary line,28 the 
Representatives urges the South Ossetian de facto authorities to protect property left behind 
by ethnic Georgian internally displaced persons from illegal appropriation, occupation or 
use. Having seen some limited construction activity in the destroyed formerly ethnic 
Georgian village of Tamarasheni on the outskirts of Tskinvali, the Representative is 
concerned about allegations that a settlement for Russian military personnel serving in the 
Tskhinvali Region/South Ossetia will be built on the site. 
</p>
<p>43. The Representative was encouraged to receive assurances from the South Ossetian 
de facto authorities in Tskhinvali and Akhalgori that property questions would be resolved 
in accordance with the rule of law. At the same time, the South Ossetian de facto authorities 
indicated that they would not recognize the privatization of housing or land in areas such as 
Akhalgori, based on laws adopted by the Government of Georgia. They argued that these 
laws never applied in the &#8220;Republic of South Ossetia&#8221; of which Akhalgori formed a part. 
Other interlocutors where reportedly told by local de facto officials in Akhalgori that land 
privatized by the Government of Georgia would be renationalized and used to compensate 
ethnic Ossetians who had lost land outside the Tskhinvali Region/South Ossetia.29

<p>44. Housing, land and property questions are extremely complex. It needs to be borne in 
mind that control over housing, land and property often changed hands several times during 
different waves of violence, conflict and displacement. The legal situation is further 
complicated by the fact that much land was considered state- or socially-owned during the 
Soviet-era and privatized only later. Against this backdrop, the Representative considers it 
essential to establish t a mechanism to resolve housing, land and property claims that is 
based on a comprehensive approach, taking into account events since the end of the Soviet 
era and addressing disputes on both sides of the administrative boundary line. International 
expertise will be needed to ensure that the mechanism is impartial and that good practices 
and lessons learnt in similar situations are applied.  
</p>
<p>45. Resolving housing, land and property disputes not only ensures that the rights of 
internally displaced persons and others are upheld, it is also important in respect of 
resolving the wider conflict and building a lasting peace. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>46. <b>The August 2008 conflict caused considerable internal displacement in and 
from the relatively small area covered by the Tskhinvali Region/South Ossetia. Only 
very few of those who were internally displaced across the administrative boundary 
line</b> <b>have been able to return. Within the Tskhinvali Region/South Ossetia many 
internally displaced persons still wait for the reconstruction of their houses. 
</b></p>
<p>47. <b>The Representative underscores that the issue of displacement has to be 
addressed comprehensively taking into account the recent and past armed conflicts 
and therefore reaffirms the recommendations made in the reports on his 2005 and 
2008 missions to Georgia. He reiterates namely his call that all parties take all 
necessary steps to ensure persons displaced by the recent and past conflicts are able to 
enjoy their right to return voluntarily to their former homes in safety and dignity, and 
to guarantee recovery of their property and possessions, or where this is impossible, 
obtain compensation or other just reparation.</b>30<b> 
</b>48. <b>While progress on questions of peace and security, in particular the conclusion 
of an agreement on the non-use of force, would build confidence and open up political 
space to improve the situation of internally displaced persons, the conflict parties 
should not make the right to return conditional to political demands. 
</b></p>
<p>49. <b>Resolving housing, land and property questions, which are to some extent an 
underlying cause of displacement, is very complex, in particular since possession may 
have changed several times since the end of the Soviet era during different waves of 
violence, conflict and displacement. The Representative therefore recommends that 
the parties agree to set up a property resolution mechanism involving international 
expertise to resolve all outstanding property claims, including those arising in the 
Tskhinvali Region/South Ossetia and Abkhazia. 
</b></p>
<p>50. <b>Much of the displacement that occurred is linked to violations of international 
humanitarian law of conflict parties. With regard to the August 2008 conflict, the 
Representative is particularly concerned about the deliberate destruction and looting 
of ethnic Georgian villages on ethno-political grounds as well as the degree of

<p><b>destruction of civilian houses and structures in the Tskhinvali Region/South Ossetia, 
which resulted from the use of weapons with indiscriminate effect in urban areas. 
These violations call for individual accountability, including for bearers of command 
responsibility, to the extent that they amount to grave breaches of international 
humanitarian law. At the same time, the Representative would urge the parties to 
consider comprehensives amnesties for militia and civilians who took up arms without 
committing international crimes, in order to facilitate the reintegration of certain 
displaced populations. 
</b></p>
<p>51. <b>Until a more comprehensive solution to the conflict is found, the Geneva 
discussions</b>31<b> or other appropriate forums can provide a venue for the conflict parties 
to come to pragmatic agreements that improve the situation of internally displaced 
persons and other conflict-affected populations. As a first step, building on the 
example set in Akhalgori, the conflict parties should allow the local population 
freedom of movement across the administrative boundary line, while taking all 
measures to protect the civilian population from harassment and extortion by border 
forces. 
</b></p>
<p>52. <b>The conflict parties also need to cooperate to help locate, mark and remove 
land mines and unexploded ordnance, including explosive remnants of cluster 
munitions of cluster projectiles, to guarantee the safety of returning internally 
displaced persons and other affected population. The Representative also calls on the 
Governments of Georgia and the Russian Federation to consider acceding to the 
Convention on Cluster Munitions, which prohibits all use, stockpiling, production and 
transfer of these weapons. 
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>While the Tskhinvali Region/South Ossetia currently does not require 
emergency humanitarian assistance, the policies on both sides effectively deny 
humanitarian actors the access needed to provide other important assistance, in 
particular assistance to reconstruct housing for the most vulnerable. The current 
access policies on both sides are not in line with the Guiding Principles and are 
notably more intransigent than approaches taken in other conflict areas visited by the 
Representative. The Representative recommends that the Government of Georgia and 
the South Ossetian de facto authorities revisit their respective stance and provide 
access to all international assistance and personnel necessary for addressing the needs 
of internally displaced persons and other conflict-affected populations in the 
Tskhinvali Region/South Ossetia through the route that is most suitable, safe and 
economic in each case. This would mean that access from both South and North 
should be facilitated. The Representative welcomes efforts of the Government of 
Georgia to amend the Law on the Occupied Territory in line with the 
recommendations of the Venice Commission to allow entry of emergency 
humanitarian assistance from the North, but urges the Government to also facilitate 
the entry of non-emergency assistance necessary for recovery activities that allow 
internally displaced persons to find durable solutions. 
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>The Representative would like to highlight that there is still a group of 3,500 
internally displaced persons in collective centres in Tskhinvali/South Ossetia, who 
were displaced from across the administrative boundary line during the 1991&#8211;1992 
conflict. The Representative urges the South Ossetian de facto authorities and other
