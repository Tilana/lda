<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Independent Expert visited Costa Rica from 
28 July to 1 August 2013. The purpose of the visit was to examine how Costa Rica was 
implementing human rights related to environmental protection, to identify good practices 
and lessons learned, and to consider the challenges the country faces in the implementation 
of environmentally related human rights.  
</p>
<p>2. The Independent Expert wishes to express his gratitude to the Government for its 
invitation and to express particular appreciation for the cooperation of the officials at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs before and during the visit. He also expresses his gratitude for 
the support given by the United Nations Resident Coordinator and the country team, 
especially the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Costa Rica.  
</p><p>3. During his visit, the Independent Expert met with the Vice-President of the 
Republic, Mr. Alfio Piva; the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Jos&#233; Enrique Castillo 
Barrantes; Judge Gilbert Armijo, the President of the Constitutional Chamber of the 
Supreme Court; the Ombudsperson (Defensora de los Habitantes de la Republica), 
Ms. Ofelia Taitelbaum Yoselewich; the Director of the State of the Nation Report, 
Mr. Jorge Vargas Cullell; the Vice-Minister of Waters and Oceans, Mr. Jos&#233; Lino Chaves; 
and senior officials from other government agencies, including the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, the Ministry of the Environment and Energy, the National System of Conservation 
Areas, the Electricity Institute and the Tourism Board. He met with a range of 
representatives of civil society, including academics and representatives of non-profit 
groups, as well as with residents of Bijagual, a town near the Pacific coast. He thanks all 
those who met with him, gave their time and cooperated with him during the visit. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Legal and institutional frameworks 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. International law 
</b></p>
<p>4. Costa Rica is party to eight core international human rights treaties, including the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The country has thus undertaken obligations to 
protect a wide spectrum of human rights related to environmental protection. 
</p>
<p>5. At the regional level, Costa Rica is a member State of the Organization of American 
States, which adopted the 1948 American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man. 
Costa Rica has ratified the American Convention on Human Rights and the Additional 
Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights in the Area of Economic, Social, 
and Cultural Rights (Protocol of San Salvador). Article 11 of the Protocol recognizes the 
human right &#8220;to live in a healthy environment&#8221; and a duty on States to &#8220;promote the 
protection, preservation, and improvement of the environment&#8221;. The Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) has also stated that:  
</p>
<p>Although neither the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man nor the 
American Convention on Human Rights includes any express reference to the 
protection of the environment, it is clear that several fundamental rights enshrined 
therein require, as a precondition for their proper exercise, a minimal environmental </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/53/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>quality, and suffer a profound detrimental impact from the degradation of the natural 
resource base.1 
</p>
<p>Similarly, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights has recognized the &#8220;undeniable link 
between the protection of the environment and the enjoyment of other human rights&#8221;.2  
</p><p>6. Costa Rica has ratified a number of international environmental agreements, 
including the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain 
Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade, the Stockholm Convention on 
Persistent Organic Pollutants and the Convention on Biological Diversity. 
</p>
<p>7. Costa Rica is also party to several International Labour Organization conventions, 
including Convention No. 169 (1989) concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in 
Independent Countries and Convention No. 87 (1948) concerning Freedom of Association 
and Protection of the Right to Organise. 
</p>
<p>8. According to article 7 of the Costa Rican Constitution, international treaties duly 
approved by the Legislative Assembly take precedence over domestic legislation. The 
Constitutional Chamber (Sala Constitucional) of the Supreme Court has held that 
international human rights treaties in force in Costa Rica &#8220;not only have similar status to the 
Constitution but also, insofar as they grant greater rights or guarantees to persons, take 
precedence over the Constitution&#8221;.3 Under the Constitutional Jurisdiction Act establishing 
the Constitutional Chamber, the Chamber can apply not only the rights enshrined in the 
Constitution, but also those recognized under international law in force in Costa Rica.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Constitutional and statutory law 
</b></p>
<p>9. The 1949 Constitution of Costa Rica was amended in 1994 to incorporate the right 
to a healthy and ecologically balanced environment. The Constitution includes other 
provisions relevant to environmental protection, including article 21, which recognizes the 
right to life, and article 89, which states that the cultural aims of the country include the 
protection of its natural beauty. The Constitution does not explicitly incorporate rights to 
health, adequate food, safe drinking water or adequate housing, but those rights have been 
indirectly protected through an expansive interpretation of other provisions.4 
</p>
<p>10. The 1995 Environment Act No. 7554 provides for, inter alia, environmental impact 
assessment (EIA); land use planning; classification of protected areas; protection of marine 
and coastal resources, wetlands, biodiversity and forests; and the regulation of air and water 
pollution. It incorporates rights of public participation, information and remedy. For 
example, it provides that the State and municipalities shall encourage the active and 
organized participation of citizens in decision-making and actions taken to protect and 
improve the environment (art. 6), and requires the creation of regional environmental 
councils to integrate a wide range of stakeholders into the environmental decision-making 
process (arts. 7&#8211;9). It provides for public participation and access to information in the EIA 
process (arts. 22&#8211;24), and establishes mechanisms to address violations and provide 
remedies (arts. 102&#8211;103). It also establishes a range of protective measures and

<p>administrative sanctions that public authorities can apply, including issuing warnings, 
rescinding permits, suspending activities and providing for compensation (arts. 98&#8211;99).  
</p><p>11. Other environmental laws include the 1996 Forestry Act No. 7575, which generally 
applies to protected areas, and the 1998 Biodiversity Act No. 7788, the objective of which 
is the conservation and sustainable use of biodiverse resources and the equitable 
distribution of their benefits (art. 1). The Biodiversity Act provides special protections for 
indigenous communities, including a requirement that their prior informed consent is 
necessary in order for others to have access to components of biodiversity resources or 
associated knowledge in indigenous peoples&#8217; territories (art. 65).  
</p>
<p><b> B. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Ministry of the Environment and Energy (MINAE) is the main institution that 
oversees environmental protection in Costa Rica. The Environment Act and other 
environmental laws provide MINAE with various mandates, including establishing and 
monitoring protected areas (art. 32) and marine protection zones (art. 42), coordinating the 
management of biodiversity (Biodiversity Act, art. 13) and managing forest resources 
(Forestry Act, art. 5). MINAE includes a number of institutions, among them the National 
Environmental Technical Secretariat (SETENA), Regional Environmental Councils and the 
National System of Conservation Areas (SINAC). 
</p><p>13. SETENA oversees the EIA process and monitors compliance with environmental 
permits for approved projects (Environment Act, chap. IV, arts. 17&#8211;24). Environmental 
permits are subject to monitoring and evaluation during the course of the project or action 
(art. 20). In cases of violation, SETENA may order the suspension of the project or action 
and the applicant can be held liable for environmental damage (art. 20). The public can also 
challenge projects that violate the terms and conditions of their environmental permits, as 
well as any other environmental laws, before a three-person Environmental Administrative 
Tribunal, a functionally independent body within MINAE (arts. 103 and 111).  
14. Regional Environmental Councils are decentralized authorities that facilitate public 
participation in environmental policy and decision-making (art. 7). SINAC, created under 
the 1998 Biodiversity Act, serves as a participatory system of management and institutional 
coordination for the forests, wildlife and protected areas of Costa Rica (art. 22), as well as 
the 11 regions designated as conservation areas under the Biodiversity Act. SINAC 
manages conservation areas primarily through the use of regional councils, which seek to 
promote public participation in the management of the areas (arts. 29 and 30). The Forestry 
Act is administered under the ambit of MINAE through various institutions, including the 
National Forestry Office, which proposes forest policies, and SINAC, which administers 
protected areas.  
</p>
<p>15. The Office of the Comptroller-General (Contralor&#237;a General de la Rep&#250;blica), an 
auxiliary institution of the Legislative Assembly, monitors the Public Treasury. All 
institutions working in the field of environmental protection are subject to its oversight 
(Constitution, arts. 183 and 184). Costa Rica has an active judiciary, at the apex of which is 
the Supreme Court of Justice. The Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court has the 
primary function of ensuring the protection of the fundamental rights embodied in the 
Constitution or in international human rights treaties to which Costa Rica is a party.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Environmental conditions in Costa Rica 
</b>16. Costa Rica ranked fifth out of 132 countries, and first among developing countries, 
in the 2012 Environmental Protection Index developed by Yale University, which takes into </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/53/Add.1 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>account a broad range of environmental criteria.5 Costa Rica has a particularly outstanding 
record in the early adoption and extensive implementation of a national system of protected 
areas, which now includes more than one quarter of all Costa Rican territory. Costa Rica 
has also adopted innovative policies to encourage reforestation, including the Forest Credit 
Certificate and the Payment for Environmental Services programme, through which private 
landowners have received payment for protecting forested areas. Those policies have been 
successful: the country has gone from about 26 per cent forest coverage in the 1980s to 52 
per cent as of 2010.6 The effective protection of natural habitat in and out of protected areas 
has helped to protect the country&#8217;s biological diversity. Costa Rica is one of the most 
biodiverse countries in the world, with over 500,000 identified species that represent nearly 
4 per cent of the number of species in the world. Costa Rica is a leader in other areas of 
environmental policy as well. For example, it has banned open-pit mining and it has 
announced its intention to become entirely carbon-neutral by 2021.7 
</p>
<p>17. Despite its well-deserved international reputation for its environmental 
accomplishments, Costa Rica faces challenges, including with respect to maritime 
protection, water pollution and reliance on fossil fuels. According to one comparative 
assessment of progress by States towards healthy oceans, Costa Rica ranks only 135th in 
the world.8 Costa Rica has taken important steps to recognize marine protected areas, but 
the State of the Nation report, a respected independent evaluation described below in 
section IV (C), warns that robust conservation systems are still lacking in maritime areas. 
Costa Rica stands out in Latin America for its near-universal water supply, but measures of 
water quality are more troubling. As explained in section V (D) below, most Costa Ricans 
lack access to a sewage system, and sewage and many other pollutants are discharged 
directly into rivers, making them among the most polluted in Latin America. In its 
production of electricity, Costa Rica has an admirably high percentage of renewable energy 
sources, especially hydroelectric plants. But Costa Rica will still find it difficult to reach its 
goal of carbon-neutrality because the largest source of energy demand is the growing 
transportation sector, which relies almost entirely on hydrocarbons.9  
</p>
<p>18. In general, the State of the Nation report suggests that Costa Rica needs to improve 
its overall environmental management, including through greater attention to environmental 
issues beyond conservation policies. It urges Costa Rica to engage in greater regional 
planning and, in particular, more effective land use planning.10  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Good practices 
</b>19. In its resolution 19/10, the Human Rights Council requested the Independent Expert 
to identify, promote and exchange views on best practices relating to the use of human 
rights obligations and commitments to inform, support and strengthen environmental 
policymaking, especially in the area of environmental protection. Generally, the 
Independent Expert prefers to use the term &#8220;good practice&#8221; to &#8220;best practice,&#8221; because in 
many situations it is not possible to identify a single &#8220;best&#8221; approach. The term &#8220;practice&#8221; is

<p>defined broadly, to include laws, policies, case law, jurisprudential shifts, strategies, 
administrative practices, projects and so forth. To be a good practice, the practice should 
integrate human rights and environmental standards in an exemplary manner. Such 
integration could occur through the application of human rights norms to environmental 
decision-making and implementation, for example through the use of rights of access to 
information, participation and remedy. The integration could also occur through the use of 
environmental measures to define, implement and preferably exceed minimum substantive 
standards set by human rights norms. Either way, the practice should be exemplary from 
the perspective of human rights and from that of environmental protection. 
</p>
<p>20. Costa Rica has many good practices in the use of human rights obligations in 
environmental policymaking, and the following list is not exhaustive. The present section 
of the report highlights important and innovative uses of three rights: the right to a healthy 
and ecologically balanced environment, the right of access to legal remedies and the right to 
environmental information.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Right to a healthy and ecologically balanced environment 
</b></p>
<p>21. In 1994, Costa Rica amended its Constitution to state, in article 50:  
</p>
<p>Every person has the right to a healthy and ecologically balanced environment, 
being therefore entitled to denounce any acts that may infringe the said right and 
claim redress for the damage caused. The State shall guarantee, defend and preserve 
that right. The Law shall establish the appropriate responsibilities and penalties. 
</p>
<p>Based on his study of the growing number of constitutionally protected environmental 
rights in countries around the world, David Boyd has argued that such rights have several 
benefits. They provide unifying principles that support strong national environmental laws; 
they provide a legal basis for direct judicial enforcement of the rights; and they appear to be 
correlated with superior environmental performance overall.11  
</p>
<p>22. The experience of Costa Rica provides evidence of the benefits of adopting such a 
constitutional right. During the visit of the Independent Expert, government officials and 
members of civil society repeatedly emphasized that the constitutional right symbolizes the 
importance Costa Rica places on environmental protection in general, and on the link 
between environmental protection and human rights in particular. There can be no doubt 
that article 50 provides a strong basis for the country&#8217;s environmental statutes and policies. 
For example, the Environment Act explicitly cites the constitutional right as one of the 
principles underlying that legislation (art. 2). The constitutional right has also enabled 
direct enforcement by the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court, which has 
developed extensive jurisprudence applying the right to a wide range of environmental 
issues. The Constitutional Chamber began to adopt environmental jurisprudence even 
before the adoption of the explicit right to a healthy environment, by linking environmental 
protection to the right to life.12 In 1994, in the <i>Presidente de la Sociedad Marlene SA v. 
Municipality of Tib&#225;s Marlene </i>case, the Chamber stressed that the State had a positive 
obligation to protect nature in order to avoid severe limitations on the right to life.13 Indeed, 
that decision helped to spur the adoption of the explicit constitutional right in 1995.

<p><b>A/HRC/25/53/Add.1

</p>
<p>23. Since 1995, much of the case law of the Constitutional Chamber has concerned the 
application of article 50. According to information received from the Chamber, it has 
reviewed issues of constitutionality in environmental matters on 85 occasions between 
1989, when the Chamber was established, and 2012 and has reached findings of 
unconstitutionality 36 times, or 42 per cent of the total. The largest single categories of 
decisions of unconstitutionality have been those involving protected areas (13 decisions)14 
and EIA procedures (5 decisions),15 but it has reviewed a wide range of issues, including 
mineral concession authorizations,16 aerial spraying,17 toxic substances used for baking,18 
deforestation,19 ecotourism,20 protection of marine national parks,21 the procedure of the 
Environmental Administrative Tribunal22 and the use of pesticides.23 To give just a few 
examples, it has held that article 50 has been violated by a law permitting the hunting of 
green turtles; by the authorization of timber harvesting in the habitat of the green macaw; 
by the authorization of construction in Las Baulas National Park; and by the failure of the 
Government to take adequate measures to protect groundwater in approving a high-density 
urban development.24 As this partial list indicates, the Constitutional Chamber has defined 
the scope of article 50 broadly, transcending basic or primary protection of environmental 
components such as water to include factors relating to the economy, tourism, farming and 
other activities.25 It has held that the right requires not only that the State refrain from direct 
violations, but also that it protect against violations from others,26 and in this regard, it has 
underscored the role of the State as the guarantor for the protection and safeguarding of the 
environment and natural resources.27 Although plaintiffs may not necessarily demand that 
the State take a particular course of action, they are entitled to insist that the State adopt 
measures that are suitable for the protection of the right.28 These obligations extend to 
national agencies with general authority such as MINAE, to specialized agencies such as 
SETENA and the Tourism Board (ICT), and even to local municipalities.29 
24. The Chamber has also derived from the right to a healthy environment a principle of 
<i>in dubio pro natura</i>, or a precautionary principle, by which it means that if there is a lack of 
certainty about whether activities might cause serious and irreparable damage, the 
Government should refrain from the activities.30 The Chamber has also emphasized the 
importance of procedural rights in the environmental context, stating that the guarantee of a 
right to a healthy environment includes the design and implementation of procedural 
mechanisms that establish effective access to the protection of the right.31

</p>
<p><b> B. Right to access to remedy 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognizes that &#8220;everyone has the right 
to an effective remedy by the competent national tribunals for acts violating the 
fundamental rights granted him by the constitution or by law&#8221; (art. 8). Similarly, the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires each of its parties to ensure 
that any person whose rights as recognized in the Covenant are violated &#8220;shall have an 
effective remedy&#8221;, that &#8220;any person claiming such a remedy shall have his right thereto 
determined by competent judicial, administrative or legislative authorities, or by any other 
competent authority provided for by the legal system of the State, and to develop the 
possibilities of judicial remedy&#8221; and that &#8220;the competent authorities shall enforce such 
remedies when granted&#8221; (art. 2 (3)).  
</p><p>26. That obligation is included in other human rights instruments, including in article 25 
of the American Convention on Human Rights. Its application in the environmental context 
has also been recognized in international instruments, in particular in principle 10 of the 
1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, which states that &#8220;effective access 
to judicial and administrative proceedings, including redress and remedy, shall be 
provided&#8221; (A/CONF.151/26 (Vol. I)). As noted above, article 50 of the Costa Rican 
Constitution provides not only that &#8220;every person has the right to a healthy and ecologically 
balanced environment&#8221; but also that every person is &#8220;therefore entitled to denounce any 
acts that may infringe the said right and claim redress for the damage caused&#8221;. The 
Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court has stressed that the right of participation in 
environmental matters is a fundamental, constitutionally protected right,32 which includes 
the ability of community members to have access to court to seek remedies for violations of 
the right to a healthy and ecologically balanced environment.33 Costa Rica has implemented 
that obligation in several ways, of which the following sections highlight three: (i) the 
jurisprudence of the Constitutional Chamber on legal standing; (ii) the flexible procedures 
of MINAE and of the Environmental Administrative Tribunal; and (iii) the general 
oversight capability of the Office of the Ombudsperson.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court 
</b></p>
<p>27. Article 48 of the Constitution provides for the remedy of amparo in order to 
maintain or re-establish the enjoyment of rights set out in the Constitution, as well as those 
of a fundamental nature established in international human rights treaties enforceable in 
Costa Rica. The amparo cause of action has been construed very broadly, to allow any 
person to file a case regarding a constitutional right without a lawyer, with no filing fees, in 
any language, at any time, on any day of the year and in any form, including handwritten 
notes.34 Furthermore, in 1994, the Constitutional Chamber broadened the notion of legal 
standing further by establishing the principle of &#8220;intereses difusas&#8221; whereby individuals are 
allowed to bring actions on behalf of the public interest, including in the interest of 
environmental protection.35  
</p>
<p>28. Lowering the barriers to access for those claiming violations of constitutional rights 
in general, and for environmental rights in particular, is truly an exemplary practice and one 
that should be an inspiration to other States. It has enabled the people of Costa Rica to have 
easy access to the Constitutional Chamber, and they have responded. In 2012 alone, the 
Constitutional Chamber received 14,953 amparo petitions; it has received 68,537 petitions

</p>
<p>since 1989.36 Some of the petitions are duplicative and can be considered together; 
nevertheless, the processing of so many petitions obviously represents a challenge for any 
tribunal. The Independent Expert was impressed with the Supreme Court&#8217;s systematic 
method of organizing and considering the petitions so that they neither overwhelm the 
Court nor fail to receive proper attention.  
</p>
<p>29. Despite these successes, the Independent Expert was concerned to learn that the 
decisions of the Constitutional Chamber are not always met with compliance. While he sees 
that fiscal limitations may make compliance with some decisions difficult, compliance with 
the decisions of the highest court with jurisdiction over environmental matters is an 
important component of an environmental policy that fully respects human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Ministry of the Environment and Energy and the Environmental Administrative 
Tribunal 
</b></p>
<p>30. As noted above, the principal environmental agency in Costa Rica is the Ministry of 
the Environment and Energy (MINAE). One innovative way that MINAE facilitates access 
to remedies is through an Internet platform on its website where individuals may register 
complaints of environmental problems.37 The system automatically assigns each complaint 
an identification number, sends it to the relevant department for investigation and notifies 
the complainant of the result. The system is easily searchable for information about the 
nature and disposition of other complaints as well.  
</p>
<p>31. The Environmental Administrative Tribunal created by the Environment Act has 
jurisdiction to hear complaints for violations of all laws protecting the environment and 
natural resources (art. 111). The Tribunal can carry out on-site visits to determine the nature 
of environmental damage, and when it finds that a violation has occurred, it can impose 
fines and administrative sanctions for the elimination or mitigation of the damage caused. It 
can also take interim measures of protection according to the <i>in dubio pro natura</i> or 
precautionary principle (arts. 98, 99 and 108). The combination of these factors makes the 
Tribunal an effective mechanism to provide access to a wide range of remedies to 
individuals and communities threatened with environmental harm. The Tribunal has issued 
decisions suspending operations at pineapple-processing plants and pineapple plantations, 
for example, on the ground that they are not complying with applicable pollution 
standards.38  
</p>
<p>32. In addition to these traditional legal remedies, the Tribunal has adopted creative 
approaches to engage with various stakeholders in the field of environment protection. To 
increase awareness in the pineapple industry of unsound environmental practices, it 
developed a training and outreach programme that included scientific and legal instruction 
on the environmental impacts of pineapple processing as well as on the legal framework 
that compelled intervention by the Tribunal. The result was to build greater awareness of, 
and support for, the need to change practices in order to better protect the environment.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Office of the Ombudsperson  
</b></p>
<p>33. The Office of the Ombudsperson is an independent body of the Legislature, which 
has the general responsibility of protecting the rights and interests of Costa Ricans by

<p>ensuring that the public sector meets standards set by the Constitution, statutes, 
conventions, treaties and general principles of law, as well as standards of morality and 
justice.39 It has the authority to investigate, either on its own initiative or upon request, 
complaints of alleged human rights violations by public authorities through administrative 
acts or omissions in the exercise of administrative functions. The Ombudsperson can 
initiate judicial or administrative proceedings to address such violations and can also 
participate in the legislative process, including through participating in parliamentary 
debates and reviewing legislative proposals, in order to promote the human rights of 
citizens.40  
</p>
<p>34. Much of the work of the Ombudsperson in recent years has concerned 
environmental issues, including the constitutional right to a healthy and ecologically 
balanced environment. In 2011, of the 3,305 cases received by the Office of the 
Ombudsperson, 311 concerned the right to a healthy environment.41 In approaching those 
cases, the main function of the Ombudsperson has been to promote the active participation 
of representatives of civil society and to monitor the performance of government 
institutions.42  
</p>
<p><b> C. Right to information 
</b></p>
<p>35. Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognizes that the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression includes the freedom &#8220;to seek, receive and impart 
information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers,&#8221; language that is 
echoed in article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Similarly, 
article 13, paragraph 1, of the American Convention on Human Rights provides that the 
right to freedom of thought and expression &#8220;includes freedom to seek, receive, and impart 
information and ideas of all kinds&#8221;. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights has stated 
that:  
</p>
<p>Article 13 of the Convention protects the right of all individuals to request access to 
State-held information, with the exceptions permitted by the restrictions established 
in the Convention. Consequently, this article protects the right of the individual to 
receive such information and the positive obligation of the State to provide it, so that 
the individual may have access to such information or receive an answer that 
includes a justification when, for any reason permitted by the Convention, the State 
is allowed to restrict access to the information in a specific case. The information 
should be provided without the need to prove direct interest or personal involvement 
in order to obtain it, except in cases in which a legitimate restriction is applied.43 
</p>
<p>Article 46 of the Costa Rican Constitution is particularly relevant in this respect: it provides 
that &#8220;consumers and users are entitled to the protection of their health, environment, safety 
and financial interests, <i>to receive adequate and truthful information, </i>to freedom of choice 
and to equal treatment&#8221; (emphasis added).44

<p>36. The significance of the right to information can apply with particular force in the 
environmental context because of the dangers posed to those unaware of potential 
environmental harm. Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development 
states that &#8220;at the national level, each individual shall have appropriate access to 
information concerning the environment that is held by public authorities, including 
information on hazardous materials and activities in their communities&#8221;. One important 
method of implementing the right to information about the environment is through 
environmental impact assessment (EIA). Principle 17 of the Rio Declaration states that 
&#8220;environmental impact assessment, as a national instrument, shall be undertaken for 
proposed activities that are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the environment 
and are subject to a decision of a national authority&#8221;.  
</p><p>37. In Costa Rica, EIA is overseen by SETENA according to the Environment Act and 
the General Regulation on the Procedures of Environmental Impact Assessment (Executive 
Decree No. 31849-MINAE-SALUD-MOPT-MAG-MEIC).45 The EIA process provides 
opportunities for public participation and access to environmental information. The public 
is entitled to be heard by SETENA at any stage of the evaluation process and the 
operational phase of the work or the project, and SETENA is required to address comments 
from stakeholders in its final assessment report (art. 22). Within five days following the 
receipt of an EIA from the proponent of a project, SETENA must forward an excerpt from 
it to the municipalities in whose jurisdiction the work, activity or project will take place, 
and also must disclose the EIA to the mass media (art. 22). The information contained in 
the record of the EIA will also be made public and available for consultation by any person 
or organization. The technical criteria and the weightings SETENA uses to analyse EIAs 
are required to be made public (art. 24).  
38. The adoption of an effective EIA procedure is of fundamental importance, but it is 
not the only way in which Costa Rica and other countries can implement the right to 
information about environmental matters. The following sections describe two particularly 
innovative approaches Costa Rica has taken to this issue: (i) the State of the Nation report; 
and (ii) the certification process of its Tourism Board.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. State of the Nation report 
</b></p>
<p>39. The State of the Nation Program was established in 1994 as a UNDP project, with 
support from the National Council of Public University Rectors (CONARE) and the Office 
of the Ombudsperson.46 In 2003, it was restructured as an institutional programme under 
CONARE, in partnership with the Office of the Ombudsperson and the four public 
universities of Costa Rica. Since 1995, the State of the Nation Program has produced an 
annual report that serves as a performance monitoring system for Costa Rica, through the 
selection, measurement and evaluation of a wide range of components of sustainable human 
development. Its ground-breaking approach goes beyond conventional indicators, by 
employing innovative research tools such as a statistical compendium with more than 500 
references. The report provides in-depth, independent analysis of challenges and successes 
in four general areas: social, economic, environmental and political. The drafters, who 
enjoy complete editorial freedom, rely on academic research and dialogues with diverse 
groups in public and private sectors and communities. The State of the Nation report is a

</p>
<p>good practice for its independent and regular reporting on developmental and 
environmental issues, and its dissemination of up-to-date and reliable information to 
support citizen participation in policymaking.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Certification for Sustainable Tourism  
</b></p>
<p>40. The Costa Rican Tourism Board (ICT) is an autonomous body under the Ministry of 
Tourism. Among other tasks, it administers the Certification for Sustainable Tourism (CST) 
programme, a voluntary points-based system created in 1998 to recognize enterprises&#8217; 
efforts towards environmentally friendly practices and business models. The programme 
differentiates businesses in the tourism sector according to the degree to which they comply 
with a sustainable model of natural, cultural and social resource management.47 
Participation in the programme is voluntary. ICT evaluates each participating business 
according to criteria concerning the relationship of the company not only with the natural 
environment, but also with its clients and its surrounding community. On the basis of the 
evaluation, the company is assigned a &#8220;sustainability level&#8221; rating. ICT conducts regular 
reassessments of the rating, with the aim of helping the business improve its performance. 
As the rating improves, the CST programme provides for greater national and international 
publicity, among other benefits.  
</p>
<p>41. It may not be immediately obvious that a certification programme designed to 
encourage sustainable tourism is a good practice in the implementation of the right to 
information, but the programme is an innovative way to provide information to consumers 
about the degree to which certain businesses are complying with or exceeding 
environmental standards. As a result, the consumers are able to choose tourism options in 
the light of greater knowledge about the environmental consequences of their choice. 
Businesses are encouraged to improve their environmental performance. Higher-performing 
businesses are rewarded with higher rankings and, in turn, with greater attractiveness to 
those looking for sustainable choices in their travel in and to Costa Rica. The benefits are 
felt by surrounding communities in economic as well as environmental terms. Indeed, 
according to a recent study of ecotourism in Costa Rica, the economic benefits from 
offering a range of &#8220;green services&#8221; around ecotourism may even include a reduction of 
poverty rates in the areas with eco-friendly tourism projects.48  
</p>
<p><b> V. Issues of concern 
</b></p>
<p>42. The following list is not intended to identify all issues of environmental concern. 
Rather, it focuses on three issues that particularly implicate human rights, as they were 
raised during the visit: (a) the rights of people living in and near protected areas; (b) the 
potential conflicts between the development of a hydroelectric project and the rights of 
indigenous people; and (c) threats to environmental human rights defenders. In addition, the 
Independent Expert followed up on the recommendations made by the Independent Expert

</p>
<p>communities called the Blue Flag Ecological Program (Bandera Azul Ecol&#243;gica), which was 
established in 1996 and currently involves some 2,200 communities. The Bandera Azul certification 
is granted to communities that exceed standards in specific areas, including ocean water quality, 
quality of potable water, quality of coastal sanitation, and environmental education. See www.visitcostarica.com/ict/paginas/mapas/areasurf.asp.

<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>on the issue of human rights obligations related to access to safe drinking water and 
sanitation during her visit to Costa Rica in 2009.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Rights of people living in and near protected areas 
</b></p>
<p>43. As noted above, more than one quarter of the territory of Costa Rica is included in 
its system of protected areas. This commitment to conservation has many benefits, but it 
also requires Costa Rica to consider how best to reconcile its interest in preventing 
environmental degradation of those areas with the interests of the people who continue to 
live in and near them.  
</p>
<p>44. At its best, the relationship between those who live in and near protected areas and 
the government agencies responsible for administering them should be, and has been, one 
of mutual support. Representatives of civil society uniformly expressed to the Independent 
Expert their strong support for the protection of the environment and their firm belief that, 
given the opportunity, Costa Ricans want to participate actively in efforts to protect it. 
When the Independent Expert met with citizens in the Bijagual community, for example, he 
was impressed not only by their commitment to sustainable living, but also by their 
willingness to help monitor environmental threats and illegal conduct in the neighbouring 
protected areas.49 However, they expressed concern that their efforts to notify the 
Government of potential problems were not always met with due attention, and that 
government surveillance of the protected areas seemed to be declining.  
</p>
<p>45. Even more troubling than failures to take advantage of local interest in helping to 
support environmental protection are instances of conflicts between policies promoting 
conservation, on the one hand, and the rights of those living in protected areas, on the other. 
During his visit, the Independent Expert learned of several such conflicts, including in 
particular one arising from a strict interpretation of laws banning structures within a certain 
distance from the coast. As a result of the interpretation, some long-standing buildings, 
including hotels, along the Caribbean coast had been destroyed, and entire communities 
were being put at risk of expulsion from places where they had lived for generations.  
</p>
<p>46. The affected communities are predominantly of Afro-Caribbean origin, a minority 
group in Costa Rica that has traditionally been somewhat isolated from the majority culture. 
Understandably, members of these communities feel that the strict interpretation of the law 
fails to take into account their rights and interests, and even reflects a degree of invidious 
discrimination against them. Everyone with whom the Independent Expert spoke about the 
issue, inside and outside the Government, recognized that this situation, as well as others 
involving similar conflicts elsewhere in Costa Rica, needs to be resolved in a way that 
respects the rights of those whose history in these places goes back generations. In 
September 2012, the Legislative Assembly passed a two-year moratorium on the eviction of 
coastal communities living in protected areas, in the hope that it would be possible to find a 
permanent solution to the problem before the moratorium expires. At the time of writing the 
present report, however, Costa Rica had not been able to find such a solution.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>49
 The community demonstrated small-scale greenhouse projects where they grow pesticide-free 
</p>
<p>vegetables and herbs, which they hope to sell at nearby tourist resorts. The Independent Expert also 
learned of other communities in Costa Rica that have embraced sustainable living practices, including 
one community in Pococ&#237;, Lim&#243;n, which is virtually carbon-neutral.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/53/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>15</b> 
</p>
<p><b> B. Hydroelectric projects and indigenous peoples 
</b>47. As part of its effort to rely on renewable energy, Costa Rica has established a system 
of hydroelectric plants. The Costa Rican Electricity Institute (Instituto Costarricense de 
Electricidad, or ICE), the State-owned electric utility company, has proposed a new 
hydroelectric dam and plant on the R&#237;o Grande de T&#233;rraba, in the south-east of the country, 
for the purposes of large-scale electricity generation. As explained in the 2011 report of the 
Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, James Anaya, on the situation of 
the indigenous peoples affected by the El Diqu&#237;s hydroelectric project in Costa Rica, the 
project would affect indigenous and non-indigenous communities. As he indicated, the 
reservoir and part of the dam would cover about 10 per cent of the territory of the 
indigenous Teribe people, and the reservoir would also flood a portion of the China Kich&#225; 
indigenous territory of the Cabecar people. Furthermore, the Rey Curr&#233; and Boruca 
indigenous territories, which belong to the Brunca people, are located downstream of the 
proposed dam and therefore could be affected by changes in the course of the river. The 
project could also affect indigenous areas upstream, including the Cabagra and Salitre 
indigenous territories of the Bribri people, the Ujarr&#225;s territory of the Cabecar people, and 
the Coto Brus territory of the Ngobe people. The project would also displace, in whole or 
part, a number of non-indigenous communities (A/HRC/18/35/Add.8, para. 2).  
48. The indigenous communities opposed the project, arguing that the Government had 
not adequately consulted them before moving forward with the design and development of 
the project. In 2011, the Government of Costa Rica invited the Special Rapporteur on the 
rights of indigenous peoples to visit the country to assist in the resolution of the conflict. In 
his subsequent report, the Special Rapporteur emphasized that &#8220;all parties agree on the need 
to undertake consultations with the indigenous peoples of the territories affected by the 
project before it is approved, and that the consultation process should be consistent with 
international standards&#8221; (ibid., para. 11). To that end, he made a number of 
recommendations designed to ensure adequate consultation with the affected indigenous 
peoples. He underlined that &#8220;according to the applicable international instruments, 
consultation with indigenous peoples who may be affected by the El Diqu&#237;s hydroelectric 
project should be undertaken with the goal of obtaining their free, prior and informed 
consent&#8221; (ibid., para. 14). The Special Rapporteur emphasized that the consent should be 
&#8220;explicitly framed in an agreement or agreements which contain commitments by the 
Government or ICE&#8221; and that the agreements &#8220;must take into account all the rights affected 
by the project in relation to each of the indigenous peoples affected, including their rights to 
land and natural resources, any rights that could underpin claims for compensation, any 
mitigation measures and sharing the project&#8217;s profits&#8221; (ibid., para. 14). He urged the State 
to allow time for the indigenous peoples to decide on their representation, and to take steps 
that would allow them to recover the land in their territories that is being occupied by non-
indigenous individuals (ibid., paras. 33 and 44).  
49. During his visit, the Independent Expert followed up on those recommendations. He 
was advised that the Government had set up a permanent round table to bring together 
indigenous leaders and government authorities to seek a dialogued resolution. The United 
Nations country team has played a mediatory role during the confrontations that still 
occasionally occur between the indigenous and non-indigenous groups over the land tenure 
issue. The Independent Expert was advised that there had been significant developments in 
the discourse, including reports from the Government of progress on resolving the issue of 
land tenure, the preparation of development plans for the indigenous territories and the 
establishment of a monthly permanent round table. He understood further that efforts were 
under way to articulate substitutes for the prevailing modality of representation of the 
indigenous communities, which many consider inadequate and not in consonance with 
traditional indigenous customs. The Independent Expert encourages the United Nations </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/53/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>presence in Costa Rica to continue the critical bridging role it plays aimed at fostering the 
trust and transparency that are essential for consensus on key issues.  
</p>
<p>50. The Independent Expert met with officials from ICE, who told him that as a result of 
the separate dialogue with indigenous peoples, communities potentially affected by the 
proposal were being treated differently. ICE was continuing to meet with non-indigenous 
communities as part of its EIA process, but was not meeting with indigenous communities, 
as a separate consultation with them was continuing. The Independent Expert made it clear 
that, while he understood the concern that rights such as the constitutional right to a healthy 
environment should be applied consistently, indigenous peoples have special protections 
under human rights law precisely because their rights are more often vulnerable to 
violation. As the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has indicated, &#8220;within 
international law generally, and inter-American law specifically, special protections for 
indigenous peoples may be required for them to exercise their rights fully and equally with 
the rest of the population&#8221;.50 Their special vulnerability stems from their historical, cultural 
and physical dependence on access to their traditional lands and the use and enjoyment of 
the natural resources on those lands. As a result, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights 
has held that States must consult with communities regarding any proposed concessions or 
other activities that may affect their lands and natural resources, ensure that no concession 
is issued without a prior assessment of its environmental and social impacts, and guarantee 
that the community receives a reasonable benefit from any such plan if approved. With 
respect to &#8220;large-scale development or investment projects that would have a major 
impact&#8221;, the State must do more than consult; it must obtain the community&#8217;s &#8220;free, prior, 
and informed consent in accordance with their customs and traditions&#8221;.51  
</p>
<p>51. ICE also shared some of the challenges it faces in translating complex scientific and 
technical information in the EIA process into lay terms, and into different languages when 
required. It stated that there is a need both for guidelines for effective consultation that are 
more clearly understood by all stakeholders and for more resources to support experts in 
making scientific and technical information intelligible to the people affected by projects.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Environmental human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>52. The rights of human rights defenders include rights to meet peacefully to protect and 
promote human rights, and to disseminate information about human rights and draw 
attention to whether they are observed in practice.52 These rights apply no less to human 
rights defenders seeking to protect a right to a healthy and ecologically balanced 
environment and other rights related to environmental protection than they do with respect 
to human rights defenders seeking to protect other human rights.  
</p>
<p>53. In many countries around the world, environmental human rights defenders face 
heightened risks when they try to exercise these rights. In her 2011 report to the Human 
Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders reported 
that she received many communications concerning environmental activists, &#8220;including 
those working on issues related to extractive industries, and construction and development

<p>projects; those working for the rights of indigenous and minority communities; women 
human rights defenders; and journalists&#8221; (A/HRC/19/55, para. 64). Environmental rights 
defenders face a high risk of killings, attacks, assault, threats and intimidation from both 
State and non-State actors (paras. 64&#8211;92). In her recent report to the General Assembly, she 
stated that the situation of defenders working on land rights and natural resources issues 
seemed to have worsened in the past five years (A/68/262, para. 17). States therefore have a 
particularly urgent responsibility to take steps to protect environmental human rights 
defenders and to investigate and respond to threats or acts of violence against them.  
</p>
<p>54. On 31 May 2013, Jairo Mora Sandoval, a volunteer with the non-profit 
environmental group Widecast, was killed on Mo&#237;n beach near the city of Lim&#243;n, on the 
Atlantic coast. He had been working to protect sea turtle nests from poachers, who take 
eggs in order to trade them on the black market. Sea turtles are among the world&#8217;s most 
endangered species and poaching is one of the greatest threats they face. An investigative 
report by <i>The Tico Times</i> suggested that poachers had become more aggressive in 2013, 
threatening Mora and other members of his organization with violence should they continue 
to try to protect the turtles.53 The police regularly patrolled the beach, although Mora and 
others complained that they still felt unsafe and wanted more police protection. On 31 July 
2013, Costa Rican police arrested several individuals suspected of having participated in 
Mora&#8217;s murder.54 After his death, environmentalists met with MINAE to urge the 
Government not only to punish those responsible for his death, but also to adopt greater 
criminal penalties for poaching and step up enforcement in Lim&#243;n. They discussed a 
suggestion, to which MINAE agreed, to set up a memorial in Mora&#8217;s name. 
Environmentalists also requested that a truth commission be established to investigate and 
examine threats and acts of violence against environmentalists over the previous two 
decades. In addition to the death of Jairo Mora, their proposal identified eight other murders 
from the late 1980s to 2011. The commission would examine those cases and other 
situations of threatened or actual violence, determine whether existing mechanisms of 
protection were sufficient, and recommend other actions necessary to improve the security 
of environmental rights defenders. The Government had not accepted the proposal at the 
time of writing of the present report.  
</p>
<p>55. The death of Jairo Mora is a tragic reminder that Costa Rica, like many other 
countries, faces increased criminal activity by narco-traffickers and poachers in its 
protected areas and other environmentally sensitive areas. That activity strains government 
and civil society efforts to protect the environment. During the visit of the Independent 
Expert, SINAC officials indicated that the department is aware of the challenges it faces in 
policing large protected areas against increasingly well-armed criminals. Although it is 
under resource constraints, it hopes to enhance collaboration with the Ministry of Public 
Safety. The Independent Expert stressed the need to strengthen protection and monitoring 
by the State in protected areas and other environmentally sensitive areas, where 
increasingly vulnerable social and community organizations and citizens have started their 
own surveillance of environmental issues and thus are exposed to harm. He emphasized 
that those policing functions are the duty of the State and it is not the task of civilians to put 
their lives at extraordinary risk. 
</p>
<p>56. Although civil society should not be expected to police criminal activity, individuals 
and groups do have the right to engage in actions designed to increase public awareness and 
influence environmental decision-making, including education, activism and even, in some 
cases, social protest. The Independent Expert encourages the Government, wherever

<p>possible, to see the positions advocated and activities undertaken by environmental 
advocates in regard to large-scale development projects not as criminal behaviour, but 
rather, as the Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders has put it, as expressions of 
support for a sustainable model of development that is people-centred, non-discriminatory, 
participatory and transparent (A/68/262, para. 37).  
57. Taking actions aimed at protecting the environment may often put individuals at 
increased risk from other private actors. While no Government is obligated to ensure an 
absolutely secure environment for its citizens under all situations, States are obligated, in 
the words of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, &#8220;to take reasonable 
measures to prevent the threats, assaults and harassment of human rights defenders; conduct 
serious investigations of the facts brought to their attention; and, where appropriate, punish 
those responsible and adequately redress the victim&#8221;.55 It is clear that the Government of 
Costa Rica took seriously its obligation to investigate the death of Jairo Mora. The 
Independent Expert is concerned, however, that the Government has responded to 
individual threats and acts of violence against environmentalists only on a case-by-case, 
post hoc basis. It is important to recognize that such situations can be part of a broader 
pattern and to examine the characteristics of that pattern, in order to fulfil the obligation &#8220;to 
take reasonable measures to <i>prevent</i> the threats, assaults and harassment&#8221; (emphasis 
added)60 before they take place. The Independent Expert understands that the Government 
believes that initiatives such as truth commissions are unnecessary in a State with a strong 
judiciary, such as that of Costa Rica. However, even the best judiciary is limited to hearing 
the cases brought before it; it does not generally have the authority to study patterns of 
threats and acts of violence over a long period and to make recommendations in response to 
them, as independent commissions of inquiry do.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Right to water and sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>58. In the report on her 2009 visit to Costa Rica, the then Independent Expert on the 
issue of human rights obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation 
observed that the country&#8217;s Water Act, which was enacted in 1942 when Costa Rica had a 
population of only 500,000, &#8220;no longer corresponds to the social and economic situation of 
the country, and needs to be urgently revised and updated&#8221; (A/HRC/12/24/Add.1, para. 61 
and A/HRC/12/24/Add.1/Corr.1). She identified several problems, including the 
overlapping and potentially conflicting responsibilities of government agencies, a lack of 
sufficient technical and financial resources, and serious disparities regarding access to safe 
drinking water. She made a number of recommendations, including that Costa Rica move 
expeditiously towards the adoption of a new water law that, inter alia<i>, </i>expressly recognizes 
that access to water constitutes a fundamental human right, adopt appropriate mechanisms 
to ensure that water facilities are accessible to all without discrimination on prohibited 
grounds, and incorporate measures to improve and monitor the quality of potable water 
(A/HRC/12/24/Add.1, para. 75). She also recommended that Costa Rica &#8220;undertake a 
comprehensive review of its normative framework on sanitation &#8230; with a view to ensuring 
the establishment of a coherent and comprehensive system for the collection, management, 
treatment and disposal of human excreta and wastewater&#8221; (para. 77) and &#8220;to take all 
appropriate measures to reduce the disparities ... with regard to access to safe drinking 
water&#8221; (para. 82).

<p>59. Four years later, some progress has been made. Approximately 98 per cent of the 
population now receive water in their homes, an improvement from 94.3 per cent in 2007, 
and 90.1 per cent have access to water of potable quality, an improvement from an 
estimated 82 per cent in 2007.56 Other areas, however, are more troubling. Perhaps most 
notable is the fact that Costa Rica has yet to adopt a revised Water Act. Moreover, many of 
the issues identified in 2009 continue to require further attention. The State of the Nation 
report indicates that water demand is exerting significant pressure on water sources, 
including the underground aquifers on which agriculture and industry largely depend.57 
Many Costa Ricans continue to lack adequate sanitation facilities, which results in the 
increased contamination of water resources. Only 20.5 per cent of Costa Ricans have access 
to a sewage system, while over 75 per cent use septic tanks.58 Most rivers in the country are 
used as receptors of sewage59 and less than 1 per cent of the sewage from the San Jos&#233; 
metropolitan area, the most populous in the country, is treated before being discharged into 
rivers.60  
</p>
<p>60. Besides sewage, pollutants such as pesticide residues, organic compounds and heavy 
metals threaten coastal waters as well as superficial and underground water bodies.61 
According to a 2011 study by the World Resources Institute, Costa Rica has the highest per 
capita use of pesticides in the world.62 Recent studies have described how the use of 
pesticides for agricultural purposes is adversely affecting river ecosystems, including by 
causing deterioration in the habitat and ecological quality of macroinvertebrate 
communities, poor plant growth, and high levels of fungicide and herbicide residue levels.63 
As a result, Costa Rica has some of the most polluted rivers in Latin America.64 Its 
wetlands also need greater protection.

<p><b>A/HRC/25/53/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(a) The adoption of a constitutional right to a healthy and ecologically 
balanced environment and the active implementation of that right through legislation 
and judicial enforcement;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) The fulfilment of the right to access to legal remedies, by broadening 
citizen standing before the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court, facilitating 
effective resolution of claims brought to the environmental ministry and its 
administrative tribunal, and bringing the resources of an independent ombudsperson 
to bear on environmental issues;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) The adoption of innovative and effective methods of providing 
information about environmental matters, including through the authoritative, 
comprehensive State of the Nation report and through the use of certification of 
businesses in the tourism industry that meet detailed criteria for environmental and 
social performance.  
</b></p>
<p><b>The Independent Expert encourages all States to give serious consideration to whether 
these good practices could make sense for them as well. He also recommends that 
Costa Rica share information about these practices with other States. He applauds its 
current efforts in that direction, including its willingness to provide information about 
its tourism certification system to other countries.  
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>Costa Rica should also consider promoting these practices in international and 
regional forums, as it is doing through the talks on a regional agreement to implement 
rights of access to information, decision-making and remedies that are currently 
taking place under the auspices of the Economic Commission for Latin America and 
the Caribbean.  
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>Although Costa Rica has a strong record of protecting and promoting 
environmentally related human rights, it does face several challenges. First, it is 
highly troubling that communities, including minority communities, are being 
threatened with expulsion from homes that they have occupied for generations, as a 
result of strict interpretations of laws governing protected areas. Conservation should 
not impose an undue cost on communities that have deep historical roots in areas of 
environmental importance. The right to a healthy environment need not conflict with 
other fundamental rights. The Independent Expert therefore recommends that Costa 
Rica move with greater expedition to resolve this situation before the expiration in 
2014 of the two-year moratorium on the eviction of coastal communities living in 
protected areas, in a manner that:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Safeguards both the right to a healthy and ecologically balanced 
environment and the rights of those who have lived in and near the protected areas 
for many years;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Takes into account that many of those affected are members of minority 
groups that have been historically on the margins of Costa Rican political life, and 
ensures that the resolution of the situation is free from discrimination on any 
prohibited grounds;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Does not regard the absence of formal legal title as necessarily 
dispositive, in the light of the fact that rights may arise in relation to long-occupied 
property even in the absence of such title;</b>65<b>  
</b></p>

 See also <i>Yordanova and Others v Bulgaria</i>, European Court of Human Rights (24 Sept. 2012), for an 
</p>
<p>example from another jurisdiction. The Court held that forced removal of Roma from their homes 
violated article 8 of the European Convention, even though they did not have title to the property.

</p>
<p><b>(d) Provides for the full and informed participation of those affected in the 
process of reaching a resolution.  
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>Second, with respect to all of its citizens, the Independent Expert recommends 
that Costa Rica continue to build on its efforts to engage those individuals and 
communities that are most directly concerned with the protection of particular areas 
in order to draw on their abilities and interests. Perhaps its greatest strength in 
relation to human rights and the environment is the broad-based commitment of its 
people to environmental protection and sustainable development. 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>Third, with respect to the El Diqu&#237;s hydroelectric project, the Independent 
Expert recommends that the State continue to engage in consultations with the 
indigenous peoples that may be affected, taking advantage of the facilitation of the 
United Nations country team and bearing in mind that the consultation should be 
undertaken with the goal of obtaining the free, prior and informed consent of the 
indigenous peoples affected.  
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>Fourth, the Independent Expert recommends that Costa Rica develop clearer 
guidelines for effective consultation with all stakeholders in respect of such projects, 
and that it provide the resources necessary to help the Electricity Institute translate 
complex scientific and technical information into language that is easily accessible and 
comprehensible to non-experts. 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>Fifth, with respect to the risk of harassment and violence directed against 
environmental human rights defenders, the Independent Expert recommends that 
Costa Rica strengthen further its efforts not only to respond to threats and acts of 
violence, but also to prevent the situations that lead to such problems. He suggests that 
Costa Rica seriously consider establishing a commission or equivalent body, with 
representatives from a range of stakeholders, which would have a mandate to examine 
the history and current situation of environmental human rights defenders in Costa 
Rica and to make recommendations about how best to improve their protection. Such 
an initiative could be a model for many other States of how to address this issue. It 
would also further demonstrate the country&#8217;s willingness to take innovative steps 
towards the protection of environmental human rights.  
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>Sixth, the Independent Expert recommends that the Government not treat 
social protests against large-scale development projects as criminal behaviour, but 
rather as expressions of the human rights to freedom of expression and association, in 
accordance with the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders (see A/68/262). 
</b>69. <b>Seventh, the Independent Expert recommends that Costa Rica revisit the 2009 
recommendations of the then Independent Expert on the issue of human rights 
obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation, with a view to 
renewing efforts to meet those recommendations, including through the adoption of a 
revised water law and through greater attention to the need for sanitation facilities.
