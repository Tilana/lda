</p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 In accordance with the mandate set forth in the 2007 agreement between the 
Government of the Plurinational State of Bolivia and the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the present report gives an overview of the 
human rights situation in Bolivia and the activities of OHCHR in the country during 2009. 
It concludes with a series of recommendations. 
</p>
<p> Important developments in 2009 include the adoption of a new Constitution on 25 
January and the holding of general elections on 6 December. Overall, both events were held 
in a peaceful and respectful way with high voter participation. President Morales was re-
elected with 64 per cent of the vote and the Movimiento al Socialismo party won two thirds 
of the seats in the new Plurinational Legislative Assembly. 
</p>
<p> With the adoption of the new Constitution, the rights of indigenous peoples have 
attained new levels of recognition. Economic, social and cultural rights are reflected 
prominently in the new constitution, while the Government has been taking additional 
measures in this respect, for instance measures aimed at reducing maternal and infant 
mortality. Still, despite the efforts taken by the Government, indigenous peoples continue 
to register adverse social and economical living conditions and some are subjected to 
servitude and forced labour. The Durban Review Conference fostered efforts to combat 
racism and discrimination, helping to put the issue on the national agenda. However, the 
need for legislative development and institutional reinforcement remains significant.

<p>during the military dictatorships, the start of the trial against former President S&#225;nchez de 
Lozada and others, and the beginning of the payment of reparation to victims in that case 
have represented significant advances. Progress is still needed in the provision of effective 
reparation to victims of other human rights violations. Also noteworthy is the advance in 
the investigations into the Pando massacre of September 2008 and into racist incidents in 
Sucre of May 2008. Meanwhile, the judicial system is still experiencing a deep institutional 
crisis amid political division between the Government and the opposition, while the failure 
to fill senior judicial posts continues to paralyse the Constitutional Court. 
 OHCHR in the Plurinational State of Bolivia (OHCHR-Bolivia) monitored human 
rights developments in several of the country&#8217;s departments. Particular attention was paid 
to judicial developments in emblematic human rights cases; attacks on freedom of 
expression and human rights defenders; as well as human rights issues during the national 
referendum and the general elections. 
</p>
<p> Some progress was achieved in the implementation of the National Human Rights 
Action Plan, adopted in 2008, including the installation of the National Human Rights 
Council and efforts to combat racism and discrimination. The Government and civil society 
actively participated in various consultations in preparation for the universal periodic 
review, which Bolivia is to undergo in February 2010. The process was inclusive and 
relevant stakeholders submitted their reports.

</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> GE.10-12207 
</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the 
Plurinational State of Bolivia (OHCHR-Bolivia) was established by an agreement signed in 
February 2007 between the High Commissioner and the Government of Bolivia. The 
agreement, which was approved by Congress on 13 July 2007, provides OHCHR-Bolivia 
with a broad mandate that comprises, inter alia, the provision of technical assistance to 
public institutions and civil society organizations; the promotion of human rights; and the 
monitoring and reporting on the status of human rights in the country. 
</p>
<p>2. In accordance with the mandate of OHCHR-Bolivia, the present report gives an 
overview of the human rights situation in Bolivia, highlighting main achievements and 
issues of concern in 2009. It also details the main activities of the office during this period 
and makes several recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b> II. National context 
</b></p>
<p>3. On 25 January 2009, for the first time in Bolivian history, a referendum was held for 
the adoption of a new constitution, and to decide on the maximum extension of land that 
anyone may constitutionally own. The Constitution was approved by 61.43 per cent of 
voters, whilst 80.65 per cent voted for a limit to land ownership of 5,000 hectares. Overall 
voting took place in a peaceful and respectful atmosphere, with high voter participation. 
</p>
<p>4. Promulgated on 7 February, the Constitution represents a major step forward, as it 
includes a vast range of rights, formally recognizing almost all those listed in the 
International Bill of Human Rights and fully incorporating the collective rights of 
indigenous peoples, including those of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples. It confers supra-constitutional status to international human rights 
treaties and incorporates additional protection mechanisms. The rights of women are 
recognized across several articles in the Constitution and the non-discrimination clause 
contains a great number of grounds. Although it recognizes all due process of law 
guarantees, the main concern of OHCHR-Bolivia with regard to the Constitution refers to 
the retroactive application of criminal law in cases of corruption.  
</p>
<p>5. Shortly after the adoption of the Constitution, a number of incidents led to differing 
interpretations of some of its provisions. In one case, the Regional Workers Union of El 
Alto, misapplying the Constitution&#8217;s social control provisions, requested financial reports 
from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) so as to understand the provenance of their 
funding. In another case, an act of appropriation by community members took place at a 
former vice-president&#8217;s property. Problems of this nature highlighted the need for prompt 
complementary legislation to the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>6. The approval in April 2009 of Electoral Transition Law 4021 convening general 
elections for 6 December 2009 was preceded by intense negotiations between Government 
and opposition. President Morales went on a hunger strike to try to secure the Law&#8217;s rapid 
adoption. The Law provided for the creation of a new electoral roll incorporating voters&#8217; 
biometric data and allowing only a limited number of Bolivians residing in four other 
countries to vote. It also recognized seven indigenous electoral districts, which indigenous 
organizations regarded as insufficient.  
</p>
<p>7. Over 5,100,000 persons in Bolivia and abroad were registered in the new electoral 
roll. President Morales was re-elected with 64 per cent of the vote and his party, the 
Movimiento al Socialismo, obtained two thirds of the seats in the new Plurinational 
Legislative Assembly. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/26/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-12207 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>8. Parallel to the December elections, referendums were also held on departmental, 
regional and indigenous autonomies. Departmental autonomy was approved in all of the 
five departments consulted (Cochabamba, Chuquisaca, La Paz, Oruro and Potos&#237;). The 
Gran Chaco region also voted for its autonomy, and 11 out of 12 municipalities voted in 
favour of indigenous autonomy. This represented a step forward in the construction of the 
new model of autonomies envisaged in the new Constitution.  
</p>
<p>9. There was no recurrence of the previous year&#8217;s scenes of violence or activity of the 
<i>grupos de choque </i>(&#8220;clash groups&#8221;), but the marked political division between the 
Government and the opposition persisted. 
</p>
<p>10. After bombings in Santa Cruz, a police raid was conducted in a Santa Cruz hotel in 
April with the aim of dismantling an alleged terrorist group, in which three people were 
killed and two arrested. Other bombings in La Paz also caused a great deal of alarm in the 
population.  
</p>
<p>11. Finally, amid the continued political division between the Government and 
opposition groups, the already weakened and politicized justice system has been more 
vulnerable to the political factor, impacting on the progress of proceedings and putting into 
question the independence and impartiality of certain justice officials. The number of 
vacancies in higher levels of the judiciary continued to increase, seriously undermining its 
work, particularly that of the Constitutional Court.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Human rights situation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Human rights of indigenous peoples</b>1<b> 
</b></p>
<p>12. The new Constitution provides better guarantees for the protection of the rights of 
indigenous peoples (referred to as &#8220;<i>pueblos ind&#237;gena originario campesinos</i>&#8221;) and for 
finding new ways to reconcile individual and collective demands of Bolivians. A number of 
political, economic, social and cultural measures have been taken to overcome the historical 
exclusion suffered by indigenous peoples. Important provisions in the new Constitution 
relate to the right to consultation, distribution and ownership of land, indigenous autonomy 
and an indigenous justice system. Their application will be a significant challenge.  
13. The right of indigenous peoples to be consulted was first contemplated in the 
Hydrocarbons Law 3058 (2005) and in subsequent Supreme Decrees 29033 (2007) and 
29574 (2008), which established consultation procedures as regards oil and natural gas 
extraction in community lands including native community lands. These laws will be more 
effective now that the right to consultation is constitutionally guaranteed. On the other 
hand, no specific regulations have been established regarding mining and major 
construction projects. Nevertheless, no extraction project can start without a prior social 
and environmental impact study. Various indigenous groups have complained however that 
there is no systematic implementation on consultation, and that decisions have been made 
on energy development and road projects without consultation and the consent of 
indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>14. Legal recognition of both the individual and collective rights of indigenous peoples 
over land and territory is essential to ensure their subsistence and traditional forms of 
development. The new Constitution specifically recognizes, protects and guarantees the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 According to the 2000 census, 62 per cent of the Bolivian population over the age of 15 self-identify 
</p>
<p>as belonging to one of the 36 indigenous peoples that exist in the country. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/26/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.10-12207 
</p>
<p>individual and community ownership of land, as serving an economic and social function 
(art. 393). The National Institute of Agrarian Reform and the Vice-Ministry of Land 
reported that titles for nearly 26 million hectares have been granted since 2006 (4,476,115 
in 2009). 
</p><p>15. The constitutional recognition of indigenous justice systems (which are accorded the 
same status as the ordinary justice system) has marked a new step in ensuring the right of 
access to justice and the rights of indigenous peoples. At the same time, it has opened a 
debate on how to develop both justice systems, setting their respective scope of application 
in accordance with international human rights norms. Most indigenous organizations have 
stated their intention to develop their systems of justice using international human rights 
law as their reference. However, a debate on indigenous justice intensified following a 
notorious case in May 2009, in which indigenous authorities in the Isiboro S&#233;cure National 
Park and Indigenous Territory applied corporal punishment to a former indigenous leader in 
application of indigenous justice. The Minister of Justice condemned the incident. 
16. The Electoral Transition Law created seven special indigenous electoral districts 
and, for the first time, indigenous peoples have direct representation in the Plurinational 
Legislative Assembly, which has replaced the National Congress. Twelve municipalities in 
5 departments were given permission to hold referendums on indigenous autonomies on 6 
December; 11 voted in favour of autonomy. Indigenous leaders believe nonetheless that the 
current number of electoral districts does not give indigenous peoples enough voice in the 
Assembly and hope that the new electoral law, to be adopted in 2010, will propose a fairer 
representation system. 
</p>
<p>17. Located in the Chaco region, the Guaran&#237; people have been seeking to reconstitute 
their territorial organizations, as well as their authority systems and cultural identity. But 
this initiative is being hampered by the fact that many families and communities are still 
subjected to servitude and forced labour. This situation was put in evidence by the United 
Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues during its visit to Bolivia from 30 April to 
6 May. The Permanent Forum concluded that the direct participation of those affected and 
also the involvement of relevant authorities at the national, departmental and municipal 
levels is required to overcome this serious problem.  
</p>
<p>18. The freedom of association of the Guaran&#237; has also been compromised as certain 
local landowners and authorities have threatened and prevented Guaran&#237; communities and 
leaders from holding meetings. Teachers have also been prevented from carrying out 
educational activities with Guaran&#237; children. Also of serious concern are accounts before 
the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues of sexual abuse by landowners and their staff of 
Guaran&#237; girls who have allegedly been taken from their families to work as servants in 
urban areas. 
</p>
<p>19. Although the Guaran&#237; people have been preparing an integral development plan, the 
support of the Government should continue through to the plan&#8217;s final elaboration and 
implementation. Earlier attempts to move in the direction of such a plan have not yet 
yielded results. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Racism, discrimination and intolerance 
</b></p>
<p>20. Racism, discrimination and intolerance persist and are often expressed openly. 
Although expressions of racism were less violent than in 2008, racial discrimination against 
Bolivians of indigenous and African descent continues to be one of the most common 
forms of discrimination. Of particular concern is the situation of invisibility and social 
exclusion in which the Afro-Bolivian communities live. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/26/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-12207 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>21. The authorities took concrete steps towards eliminating prevailing discriminatory 
ideologies and practices by the creation, in February 2009, of a Vice-Ministry of 
Decolonization within the Ministry of Cultures and of a General Directorate for Combating 
Racism. In addition to several awareness-raising activities, the Vice-Ministry and the 
General Directorate have worked on drafting new legislation to combat racial 
discrimination (currently under the consideration of Parliament).  
</p><p>22. The Durban Review Conference helped put the fight against racism and 
discrimination in Bolivia on the national agenda. The Minister of Justice pledged to follow 
up on the Conference&#8217;s recommendations and to hold various seminars on the issue. Civil 
society groups involved in combating racism also organized awareness-raising activities. 
</p>
<p>23. Attempts were made to provide the victims of the serious racial violence in Sucre on 
24 May 20082 redress. For example, Supreme Decree 131 declared 24 May as the National 
Day of Struggle against Racism and Discrimination, whilst the Human Rights Commission 
of the Chamber of Deputies issued a report with its findings on the incidents.3 
</p>
<p>24. Despite some governmental initiatives, Bolivia has yet to adopt legislation that 
criminalizes racial discrimination, as suggested by the Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination on several occasions since 1972.  
</p>
<p>25. With regard to other forms of discrimination, violence against women continues to 
be widespread, although laws have been enacted against domestic violence (Law 1674 of 
1995) and for the protection of victims of sexual violence (Law 2033 of 1999). Women&#8217;s 
rights organizations have pointed out, for example, that only 11 per cent of cases of 
violence are dealt with in family courts and that 70 per cent of complaints are abandoned 
before they are judged. 
</p><p>26. Anti-discrimination laws and policies adopted in 2009 include, inter alia, Supreme 
Decree 213 against discrimination in recruitment processes; Supreme Decree 264 declaring 
the Day of Dignity of the Elderly and extending legally established discounts and privileges 
for the elderly; and Supreme Decree 189 declaring 28 June as the Day of the Rights of 
People of Different Sexual Orientation. 
</p>
<p>27. Bolivia has ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its 
Optional Protocol, however, the situation of people with disabilities continues to be 
challenging. In August, the Government issued Supreme Decree 256 provisionally 
regulating the use of over US$ 5 million for 10 programmes for people with disabilities, to 
be implemented in 2009. Several organizations staged demonstrations objecting to this 
measure on the grounds that they had not been properly consulted on the design of the 
programmes and that the decree had come too late in the year to make its implementation 
effective. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Rule of law: administration of justice and the fight against impunity 
</b>28. OHCHR-Bolivia monitored the administration of justice, which continues to suffer 
from a profound, long-lasting structural crisis. It also followed the progress of key human 
rights cases. As a result of regional, political and financial pressures, the justice system 
continues to suffer from interference, corruption and lack of independence, which 
altogether undermine access to justice, the rule of law and foster impunity.  
</p>
<p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/26/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> GE.10-12207 
</p>
<p>29. Significant progress was observed in the fight against impunity, although the 
weaknesses that plague the justice system continue to have considerable impact. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Unfilled judicial posts and independence of lawyers 
</b>30. The fact that the Constitutional Court has not been functioning for the past two years 
is of grave concern. Its last remaining judge resigned in May 2009, leaving a backlog of 
5,397 cases affecting 34,096 litigants. 
</p>
<p>31. The Supreme Court of Justice, which should consist of 12 judges, was reduced to 6 
after its president was suspended on charges of delaying justice and another member was 
suspended on charges of breach of trust. The trials against these judges had not started by 
the end of 2009. Regarding the case against the Court&#8217;s President, the procedure before the 
Senate could not get under way for various reasons, including objections by both sides 
against members of the Senate court and a series of procedural incidents. Both accused 
allege that their fundamental rights are being violated, in particular, the right to due process 
of law. 
</p>
<p>32. The Judiciary Council meanwhile failed to fill its three vacancies, which left it to 
operate with just one member. As a result, vacant positions for judges throughout the 
country could not be filled. 
</p>
<p>33. President Morales convened a summit among representatives of the three branches 
of the State in July 2009 to tackle, inter alia, the appointment of senior judicial officials. No 
solution has been found thus far. Except that initiative, OHCHR-Bolivia has observed no 
great will on the part of any of the country&#8217;s political parties to reach a consensus on how to 
fill the vacant positions. 
</p>
<p>34. On 29 April 2009, Supreme Decree 100 created a Public Register of Lawyers under 
the responsibility of the Ministry of Justice, enabling it to discipline lawyers for 
professional misconduct. One of the decree&#8217;s justifications was the fact that bar associations 
charge high emolument fees, whereas registering with the Ministry of Justice would be free, 
thus facilitating access to the profession. Bar associations objected, alleging that the decree 
was an inappropriate interference by the Government that could undermine the associations 
institutionally and financially. Despite its positive aspects, the decree could have negative 
implications for the independence of lawyers, as relevant international standards indicate.4 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Investigation of the Pando massacre 
</b></p>
<p>35. In March 2009, OHCHR-Bolivia published a report on the violent events of 11 
September 2008 in Pando, in which at least 11 people were killed and 50 wounded; most of 
the casualties were persons of indigenous origin. The office concluded that this massacre 
was a grave human rights violation, allegedly committed by officials from the Pando 
prefecture and the Highway Service Department (SEDCAM), by members of the Pando 
Civic Committee, and supporters of the prefecture. OHCHR-Bolivia recommended that the 
investigation and prosecution of these events be conducted without undue delay and with 
strict respect for procedural principles.  
</p>
<p>36. The central problem in these proceedings was the determination of jurisdictional 
competence. The Supreme Court of Justice ruling of 10 September resolved the dispute in 
favour of the ordinary jurisdiction. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4
 See concluding observations of the Human Rights Committee &#8211; Belarus (CCPR/C/79/Add.86), para. 
</p>
<p>14. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/26/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-12207 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>37. On 1 October, the Chamber of Deputies approved the report of its Special 
Legislative Commission mandated to investigate the Pando massacre. On 12 October, the 
Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office brought charges of terrorism, murder, homicide, criminal 
association and injury against the former prefect of Pando, Leopoldo Fern&#225;ndez, and 26 
other people. The composition of the court for the trial in La Paz was chosen by a draw on 
27 October but was objected to by the accused. The trial had not begun by the end of 2009.  
</p><p>38. The proceedings have been held up unnecessarily as a result of the presentation by 
all parties of numerous procedural appeals, objections and criminal or disciplinary actions 
against judges, magistrates or prosecutors. The right of victims and their families to know 
the truth and obtain justice and reparation has consequently been delayed. The right of 
some of the accused in pre-trial detention to prepare their defence in due time was also 
affected. 
</p>
<p>39. Despite these delays, OHCHR-Bolivia believes that the Special Legislative 
Commission&#8217;s report and the presentation of charges by the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office 
constitute progress in this case. Nonetheless, the dispute over jurisdiction continues 
between the district court of Pando and La Paz. Moreover, the lawyers of Mr. Fern&#225;ndez 
are still challenging jurisdictional competence. 
</p><p>40. Another positive aspect was the decision by a court in El Porvenir in June 2009 to 
dismiss the case against 16 peasants who were attacked and tortured by supporters of the 
Pando prefecture on 11 September 2008 and who were then unjustly declared under 
criminal investigation for the deaths that happened that day. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Investigation of the racist incidents of 24 May 2008 in Sucre 
</b></p>
<p>41. On 24 May 2008 in Sucre, around 60 indigenous persons were subjected to racist 
abuse and physical violence.5 Investigation continues in most of the cases related to these 
incidents, and the Chuquisaca District Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office reopened three of the 
cases that had previously been closed and brought charges in two other cases. However, 
none of the charges includes the crime of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment. The lack of criminalization of racial discrimination has prevented prosecution on 
these grounds.  
</p>
<p>42. On 23 September, the Human Rights Commission of the Chamber of Deputies 
approved the final report of the investigation into the Sucre incidents, concluding that the 
racist actions were planned, organized and executed by 45 people, including the current 
prefect of Chuquisaca, the former mayor of Sucre, various opposition parliamentarians and 
members of the &#8220;Inter-Institutional Committee&#8221;. The Commission said they had committed 
crimes and human rights violations and should be charged or at least investigated by the 
Public Prosecutor. It also called for a criminal investigation of various Sucre news media, 
the Santa Cruz Youth Union (Uni&#243;n Juvenil Cruce&#241;ista) and two Sucre hospitals. 
</p><p>43. After the publication of the Commission&#8217;s report, the Chuquisaca District Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office broadened the scope of the investigation and included the above-
mentioned local authorities as suspects of various crimes. It opened new cases against local 
news media for publicly inciting criminal activity and apology of crime; against the staff of 
two hospitals for breaching the duty of care and against the Santa Cruz Youth Union for 
sedition, public disorder, criminal association and various other crimes. The challenge will 
now be to pursue the investigation with appropriate speed and impartiality.

</p>
<p>44. To date there have not been administrative investigations into the role played or lack 
of action by security forces during these incidents.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Case of former President Gonzalo S&#225;nchez de Lozada 
</b></p>
<p>45. In September and October 2003, mass protests were violently repressed by security 
forces, leaving 67 dead and over 400 wounded, the highest death toll due to political 
violence registered during a democratic regime in Bolivia.  
</p>
<p>46. On 18 May 2009, after more than five years of legal procedures, the Supreme Court 
began the trial against former President Gonzalo S&#225;nchez de Lozada, 11 members of his 
cabinet and 5 members of his military command. They were charged with nine crimes 
including massacre, homicide and torture in relation to the 2003 incidents.  
</p>
<p>47. The proceedings could continue only against 2 former ministers and 5 members of 
the 2003 military high command, as 10 defendants left the country and were declared in 
default.6 Mr. S&#225;nchez de Lozada and some of his cabinet members fled to the United States 
of America in 2003. Others left Bolivia in 2009 and some obtained political asylum in Peru. 
Despite the groundwork undertaken by the Government, no progress was made with 
extradition proceedings with the United States in 2009, while the proceedings to extradite 
those in Peru were only initiated late in the year. The trial was still ongoing by year&#8217;s end, 
though not without some procedural incidents that have threatened its continuity. 
</p>
<p>48. This trial is seen by many as an opportunity for the justice system to demonstrate 
that trials for serious human rights violations are conducted free from procedural obstacles 
and political influence. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Past enforced disappearances and declassification of military archives 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Inter-Institutional Council for Clarifying Enforced Disappearances found some 
of those who had disappeared between 1964 and 1982. In July, the Argentine Forensic 
Anthropology Team began looking for the remains of guerrillas reportedly killed by the 
army in Teoponte in 1970. Thus far, the remains of nine people have been found, out of 
which four were identified and returned to their families. 
</p>
<p>50. On 20 May, the Ministry of Defence approved Ministerial Resolution 316 which 
would authorize victims of past dictatorships and their families to access documents from 
the armed forces from that period. Relatives of some victims said the initiative was 
insufficient and bureaucratic. OHCHR-Bolivia considers this norm as an important step in 
the fight against impunity, although the procedure established for accessing military 
archives and classified information will determine its effectiveness.  
</p>
<p>51. On 12 May, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights filed a case against 
Bolivia7<b> </b>before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights concerning the enforced 
disappearances of Rainer Ibsen and his father Jos&#233; Luis Ibsen in 1971 and 1973 
respectively.8

 Under Bolivian law, default suspends the countdown of the period during which a crime can be 
</p>
<p>prosecuted. 
 
</p>
<p>7
 This is the third case of enforced disappearance in Bolivia to reach the Inter-American Court of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights. A judgement has already been rendered by the Court in the other cases (see footnotes 
9 and 10, below).

<p>52. With regard to the case of Renato Ticona Estrada&#8217;s enforced disappearance in 1980, 
the State of Bolivia began to comply with the reparation measures ordered by the Inter-
American Court of Human Rights,9 paying compensation to the victim&#8217;s relatives in 
September 2009. At the same time, the sentence imposed on the accused of the 
disappearance by a Bolivian court was upheld and two of them were jailed. The State must 
yet locate Mr. Ticona Estrada&#8217;s remains and return them to his family. 
</p>
<p>53. Despite the ruling of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in the case of Jos&#233; 
Carlos Trujillo Oroza,10 on 28 September, the Santa Cruz Higher Court of Justice upheld 
the sentence that a lower court had passed on three people in December 2008 in connection 
with Mr. Trujillo Oroza&#8217;s disappearance. The ruling confirmed the sentence of two years 
and eight months in prison on a charge of deprivation of freedom, even though serious 
human rights violations, such as enforced disappearance and torture, had been involved. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Reparation for victims of political violence 
</b></p>
<p>54. There have been continued delays in the compensation of victims of the 1964&#8211;1982 
unconstitutional regimes as envisaged by Law 2640 of 2004. The National Commission for 
the Compensation of Victims of Political Violence (CONREVIP) did not finish vetting 
cases by mid-2009, despite repeated demands by victims. Law 4069, approved on 27 July, 
replaced the CONREVIP by a Technical Certification Commission under the Ministry of 
Justice and set as a deadline 31 December 2009 to decide on pending cases. By year&#8217;s end, 
more than 1,500 applications11 were pending first instance resolution. The Commission had 
not begun to evaluate any of the requests for review submitted by the petitioners. 
</p>
<p>55. Law 4069 did not, however, correct major problems carried over from Law 2640, 
such as the requirement that 80 per cent of funds for the compensation be obtained from the 
private sector or international donors. It also failed to address the lack of provision for early 
payment to victims whose cases had already been approved. These omissions have been 
criticized by victims&#8217; organizations. 
</p>
<p>56. Although the new Commission seems to be working with greater speed and 
flexibility as regards procedural requirements at the review level, there is concern about the 
very low proportion of applications approved. According to estimates, it is no more than 3 
per cent of the caseload. OHCHR-Bolivia expressed its concern to the relevant authorities 
on several occasions about the failure to resolve these cases. 
</p>
<p>57. In December 2009, the Government began to make one-time payments, as envisaged 
in Supreme Decree 29884, to some of the victims of political violence of February, 
September and October 2003.12

<p><b> D. Security and human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Police operation to dismantle a presumed terrorist group 
</b></p>
<p>58. A police raid on the Hotel Las Am&#233;ricas in Santa Cruz in the early hours of 16 April 
2009 resulted in the deaths of three foreigners and the arrest of two others. According to 
authorities, all five were members of an alleged terrorist group. The operation aimed to 
dismantle the group, which had been implicated in the bombing the previous day of the 
home of the Archbishop of Santa Cruz, Cardinal Terrazas. It was also alleged that the group 
had planned to assassinate President Morales and other Government officials, as well as 
actions in favour of Santa Cruz&#8217;s secession from Bolivia. The two detainees were taken to 
La Paz and accused of terrorism and other crimes. Six others were subsequently arrested on 
suspicion of being part of the same group, while others were charged of funding the group. 
No charges have been brought to date.  
</p>
<p>59. On 18 November, the Chamber of Deputies approved the final report of the Special 
Multiparty Commission that was established to investigate the presumed terrorist group. 
The report concluded that Eduardo R&#243;zsa (one of the three killed in the raid), his associates 
and financial backers had planned to create a paramilitary group that aimed to divide the 
territory of Bolivia. The report recommended, inter alia, that the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office 
investigate the group&#8217;s financial connections and people with links to the group, including 
those who might have fled the country. 
</p>
<p>60. Based on police and forensic reports, the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s office said the three 
deaths occurred in the course of a shootout with the security forces. Certain opposition 
members, however, questioned the actions of the special police unit during the raid and the 
investigation of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. In particular, they claimed that the three 
deaths were extrajudicial executions. If it is confirmed that undue force was used during the 
raid, those allegedly responsible should be subjected to an administrative and, if necessary, 
criminal investigation. 
</p>
<p>61. The issue of whether Santa Cruz or La Paz had territorial jurisdiction over the 
judicial investigation was disputed intensely by all concerned parties. The Government 
issued Supreme Decree 138, giving La Paz jurisdiction over cases of terrorism, sedition and 
armed uprisings against state security and sovereignty. This decree was much criticized. 
OHCHR-Bolivia considers that the decree would violate the principle of legal reserve by 
regulating matters of criminal procedure. 
</p>
<p>62. On 29 April the Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating 
human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination called 
on the Government of Bolivia and the Governments of the countries whose nationals were 
involved in the alleged plot to fully investigate the incident and ensure accountability for 
any crimes committed. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Use of excessive force 
</b></p>
<p>63. OHCHR-Bolivia took particular note of three cases of alleged excessive use of force 
by security forces. The first concerned a police operation in connection with the Pando 
investigations, which was carried out in the early hours of 18 February and that led to the 
arrest and transfer to La Paz of seven people. Varying degrees of violence were reportedly 
used during the arrests, which were allegedly carried out without proper notification and 
exhibition of the respective arrest warrants. 
</p>
<p>64. The other two cases are related to arrests made on 16 and 28 April in connection to 
the raid on the Hotel Las Am&#233;ricas. The detainees reported to OHCHR-Bolivia that they 
were mistreated at the time of their arrest and during their transfer to La Paz. </p>

</b></p>
<p>GE.10-12207 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>65. In comparison to 2008, there were few reports of physical attacks and threats on 
human rights defenders. Certain cases were reported in the departments of Beni, Pando and 
Santa Cruz. Of particular concern was a firearm attack in February on an employee of the 
Centre for Legal Studies and Social Investigation (CEJIS) in Trinidad. It is worth 
highlighting that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights had granted 
precautionary measures for the protection of CEJIS staff members in 2008 which were 
extended through 2009. CEJIS nonetheless reported that authorities had not yet 
implemented any measures for their protection. 
</p>
<p>66. OHCHR-Bolivia is concerned by the fact that past attacks on human rights 
defenders have not been extensively and effectively investigated. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Lynching 
</b></p>
<p>67. At least 71 cases of lynching or attempted lynching were reported in the press, 
mostly of people suspected of having committed common crimes. At least 15 of the victims 
died. Most of these cases were reported in remote parts of El Alto, La Paz, where police 
presence is limited or non-existent. Some victims were burned alive or beaten, tied to 
stones and thrown into Lake Titicaca. OHCHR-Bolivia is concerned by the violence 
employed and the fact that the number of lynchings has tripled since 2008.13 
</p>
<p>68. Police forces intervened in some cases to prevent the victims from being killed. For 
the most part however, there have not been investigations and those responsible have not 
been brought to justice. OHCHR-Bolivia believes that the lack of judicial investigations 
and the apparent public tolerance for this type of practice have contributed to the increase 
of lynchings. There is no justification for the permissiveness shown to such criminal 
behaviour, which violates the most basic principles of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Political rights 
</b></p>
<p>69. In 2009, Bolivians exercised their right to vote during the constitutional referendum 
of 25 January and the general elections of 6 December. During these processes, OHCHR-
Bolivia monitored respect for freedom of expression and opinion, the right to personal 
integrity and security, and the right to vote. Other international organizations monitored the 
technical aspects of the elections. 
</p>
<p>70. OHCHR-Bolivia observed that despite a few isolated incidents the electoral 
processes took place without disturbances, in a peaceful and orderly manner. There was 
high citizen participation and general respect for civil and political rights. 
</p>
<p>71. During the constitutional referendum process, OHCHR-Bolivia noted that certain 
groups were prevented by opposing groups from demonstrating in public spaces. Most 
worrisome were acts of violence and racist insults committed in Sucre against partisans of 
the &#8220;Yes&#8221; vote by members of the &#8220;No&#8221; camp. 
</p>
<p>72. During the general election campaign, OHCHR-Bolivia observed at least 14 
incidents of violence and political intolerance. Of particular concern were the acts of 
violence committed on 12 November in the city of Santa Cruz that left at least 10 people 
injured, mainly supporters of the Movimiento al Socialismo, and caused damages to the 
Gabriel Ren&#233; Moreno University. Also of concern was the assault in Sucre of the senatorial 
candidate for the Plan Progreso Bolivia-Convergencia Nacional party.

</p>
<p><b> F. Freedom of expression and opinion 
</b></p>
<p>73. Relations between the Government and journalists improved in 2009. President 
Morales adopted several measures to reach out to the media, such as lifting a ban which 
prevented journalists from national media outlets from attending Government press 
conferences. The President also extended an invitation to the Inter-American Press 
Association to observe the situation of freedom of expression in the country. There were, 
nonetheless, some incidents involving the Government and journalists from privately 
owned media. 
</p>
<p>74. The National Observatory of News Media reported 64 cases of verbal and physical 
attacks on journalists and media from 1 January to 31 October. Most of those took place in 
the departments of La Paz and Santa Cruz. Of particular concern to OHCHR-Bolivia were 
the repeated threats and insults against journalists by the mayor of Santa Cruz, including 
publicly wishing their death. 
</p>
<p>75. OHCHR-Bolivia issued a press release condemning the fact that two Santa Cruz 
television journalists covering a police operation on 3 September were attacked by 
policemen using lethal weapons. Abuses by the special police unit (Unidad T&#225;ctica de 
Resoluci&#243;n de Crisis) that took part in the operation were reportedly the reason for the 
Government&#8217;s decision to disband it. OHCHR-Bolivia hails this decision and the starting of 
administrative and criminal investigations. 
</p>
<p>76. Still to be solved are also several cases of violence in Potos&#237;, for example an attack 
with explosives on a television station on 8 June and attacks against four journalists 
between 26 and 31 August, which have not been solved. 
</p>
<p>77. In 2008, OHCHR-Bolivia had voiced concern over the failure of justice officials to 
investigate and clarify the May 2008 murder of a Radio Municipal de Pucarani journalist.14 
This situation has remained unchanged. It is important that the relevant authorities 
investigate seriously this and other cases that took place in 2008. 
</p>
<p>78. In March 2009, President Morales filed a lawsuit alleging contempt for legally 
constituted authorities against the editor of the newspaper <i>La Prensa</i> over articles published 
in December 2008. There was an outcry from media organizations about the nature of the 
charges and the fact that the prosecution was brought under criminal law rather than the 
1925 Print Law (<i>Ley de Imprenta</i>). The President&#8217;s representatives subsequently asked the 
Public Prosecutor to change the charges to defamation and personal injury and to bring the 
prosecution before a Print Tribunal. The trial had not begun by year&#8217;s end. 
</p>
<p>79. At least five other cases of contempt for legally constituted authorities were initiated 
by public authorities at different levels. It should be noted that the Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights recommended more than a decade ago that members of the 
Organization of American States repeal all contempt laws and all other judicial provisions 
for criminal prosecutions for disrespect for legally constituted authorities on the grounds 
that they restrict freedom of expression. OHCHR-Bolivia is of the opinion that Bolivia 
needs to abandon such prosecutions as they affect the full realization of freedom of 
expression and the press.

<p><b> G. Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>80. The new Constitution recognizes all of the rights contained in the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and in the Additional Protocol to the 
American Convention in the Area of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (Protocol of San 
Salvador). Although Bolivia has a National Development Plan and despite the fact that the 
levels of poverty have fallen significantly in recent years, they are still the highest in the 
region, with 37.7 per cent of the population living in extreme poverty in 2006.15 
</p>
<p>81. The country continues to suffer from major long-term structural inequality in access 
to and use of basic services. This affects primarily women and indigenous peoples in rural 
areas. However, there was legislative progress in place and the Government was 
implementing new social programmes aimed at specific groups such as infants, mothers, 
students and the elderly. 
</p>
<p>82. The Government has in particular taken measures to improve the enjoyment of the 
rights to food, health and education. To combat maternal and infant mortality, for example, 
it issued in 2009 Supreme Decree 115 promoting breastfeeding and Supreme Decree 66 
introducing the &#8220;Juana Azurduy&#8221; subsidy for pregnant women and mothers of children up 
to the age of two. The Ministry of Health launched on 12 May its National Strategic Plan 
(2009&#8211;2015) to improve maternal, prenatal and neonatal health. Also positive was the 
continuation of the Zero Malnutrition Programme for children up to the age of two, which 
involves multisectoral governmental interventions with the support of the United Nations 
system. 
</p>
<p>83. All these measures constitute important steps towards better standards of nutrition 
and health in both infants and mothers. Whilst progress has been made, Bolivia&#8217;s rates of 
child and neonatal mortality are still among the highest in Latin America.16 
</p>
<p>84. The new Constitution establishes free mandatory primary and secondary education 
and requires the Government to guarantee education for children with differing learning 
abilities. Progress made includes the continuation of the &#8220;Juancito Pinto&#8221; cash transfer 
programme aimed at encouraging school attendance and reducing dropout rates; and the 
creation of the &#8220;Yes I can go on&#8221; National Post-Literacy Programme in February to follow 
up on the previous &#8220;Yes I can&#8221; National Literacy Programme. 
</p>
<p>85. Despite these measures, there is a need to continue improving access to and the 
quality of education further, especially in rural areas. Efforts are also needed to adopt a new 
education law. A draft education law has been under consideration of the Parliament for the 
past three years. 
</p>
<p>86. With regard to labour rights, positive measures taken by the Government include the 
continuation of the Dignity Pension Programme for people over the age of 60, and the 
adoption of decrees raising minimum wages in the private sector, setting compensation 
requirements for employees who have been laid off after working more than 90 days, and 
making it more difficult to fire working mothers and fathers in both the private and public 
sector. 
</p>
<p>87. The existence of various forms of child labour is particularly worrisome. Although 
Bolivia has a National Plan for the Elimination of Child Labour, little progress has been

<p><b> H. National Human Rights Action Plan 
</b></p>
<p>88. The mechanism in support of the 2009&#8211;2013 National Human Rights Action Plan18 
completed its internal organization during its first year. The National Human Rights 
Council, responsible for implementing and supervising the Plan, adopted a set of internal 
regulations in May regarding its structure, powers and operating methods. On 10 
December, the Council was officially inaugurated by the Vice-President in a public 
ceremony. It consists of representatives of State entities, NGOs, civil society and 
indigenous organizations. OHCHR-Bolivia participates as an observer. 
</p>
<p>89. The Vice-Ministry of Justice and Fundamental Rights promoted the Plan throughout 
the country. Initial progress was made in some areas covered, such as the promotion of 
economic, social and cultural rights, and the fight against discrimination, through the 
adoption of legislative and administrative measures (see sections B and G above). 
</p><p>90. Nonetheless, implementing the Plan and ensuring its sustainability represent a major 
challenge that will require appropriate budgetary allocation and real coordination between 
the different branches of the State, as well as effective participation of the Ombudsman&#8217;s 
Office and civil society. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Main activities of the Office of the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights in Bolivia 
</b></p>
<p>91. OHCHR-Bolivia monitored the human rights situation in Bolivia and followed up 
on emblematic human rights cases. Particular attention was paid to the human rights 
situation during the January referendum and the December elections and press releases 
were issued about various matters observed in the course of the year. 
</p>
<p>92. OHCHR-Bolivia disseminated the report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation 
of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people in various parts of the 
country, particularly to indigenous communities and organizations. Relevant authorities and 
organizations were also given advice and training on how to follow up on the 
recommendations. OHCHR-Bolivia also accompanied and advised the Permanent Forum 
on Indigenous Issues on its mission to the Chaco region. 
</p>
<p>93. Workshops were organized on the right to consultation with the United Nations 
system in Bolivia and Government authorities, and an international seminar on indigenous 
autonomies with the participation of international experts and indigenous leaders was 
organized with the Ministry of Autonomies. OHCHR-Bolivia also held a conference on 
legal pluralism and international human rights law with the participation of Government 
officials, members of the judiciary, civil society representatives and national and 
international experts, as well as a conference aimed at disseminating good legal practices 
on the right to conscientious objection to military service. Together with the Ombudsman&#8217;s

<p>95. OHCHR-Bolivia participated in seminars organized by the Ministry of Justice, the 
Ombudsman&#8217;s Office and civil society which enabled the creation of a technical committee 
to evaluate draft laws for combating discrimination and criminalizing racial discrimination. 
Together with the Vice-Ministry of Decolonization, OHCHR-Bolivia organized an 
international seminar on public policies against racism and discrimination. Training on the 
United Nations framework for combating racism was provided to staff of the Vice-
Ministry, and advice was given on the preparation of an assessment on racism and 
discrimination in Bolivia.

<p>102. Within the United Nations Country Team, OHCHR-Bolivia held workshops on the 
human rights-based approach to development programming and the universal periodic 
review, regularly participated in the activities of the Gender Technical Group and, together 
with UNICEF, drafted a publication about human rights and children&#8217;s rights for the sixty-
first anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the twentieth 
anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>103. <b>Compared with 2008, there was an overall improvement in the human rights 
situation in 2009, especially as regards the decrease in the activities of &#8220;clash groups&#8221;, 
which had affected the right to life and physical integrity in 2008. There was less 
political violence, although political division between the Government of the 
Plurinational State of Bolivia and the opposition continued throughout the year, with 
consequences on the human rights situation. Problems affecting the rule of law and 
the judicial system became more acute this year.

<p><b>  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>The High Commissioner reiterates her previous recommendations</b>20<b> and those 
of her Office.</b>21<b> In particular, she calls on relevant judicial authorities to investigate 
and prosecute all cases of human rights violations reported in 2008, ensuring that 
victims have access to independent, impartial and timely justice, and that they are 
guaranteed adequate reparation, in particular with regard to the May incidents in 
Sucre and the September massacre in Pando. She reiterates her recommendation to 
investigate whether the actions taken by the police on 11 September in Pando were the 
most appropriate to avoid the escalation of violence, prevent human rights violations 
and protect victims. The High Commissioner makes the following further 
recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Legislation 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>The High Commissioner urges the development of complementary legislation to 
the new Constitution strengthening recognition of human rights, in particular of 
indigenous peoples, in accordance with international standards. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>The High Commissioner recommends stepping up efforts to implement the 
right to consultation in accordance with the new Constitution and to carry out 
consultations and environmental impact analyses of extraction and development 
projects in the lands and territories of indigenous peoples and communities. 
</b>107. <b>The High Commissioner encourages the Government to pursue and to 
reinforce measures aimed at eradicating contemporary forms of slavery, in particular 
those conditions to which Guaran&#237; families and communities are subjected. This 
should be done with the full participation of traditional indigenous leaders. The

<p><b>Government should also follow up on the recommendations of the United Nations 
Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Racism, discrimination and intolerance 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>The High Commissioner encourages the Government to broaden its efforts 
aimed at overcoming the manifestations and root causes of racism and discrimination, 
including conducting an adequate assessment of the situation and criminalizing 
racism and discrimination.

<p><b>  Rule of law 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>The High Commissioner urges the competent bodies to guarantee transparent 
procedures for the appointment and election of new judicial authorities in accordance 
with the new Constitution. Until these procedures can be established and completed, a 
political consensus should be reached to provisionally fill the vacant judicial positions, 
especially in the Constitutional Court. 
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>The High Commissioner recommends strengthening the progress achieved in 
combating impunity by respecting the due process and guaranteeing the right to truth 
and appropriate reparation for all victims of past and present human rights 
violations. The compensations envisaged by Law 2640 should be paid without delay to 
the victims of the political violence of the 1964&#8211;1982 unconstitutional regimes. 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>The High Commissioner calls on the Public Prosecutor to also investigate and 
bring to justice those responsible for the human rights violations reported, including 
the incidents that occurred during the electoral campaigns. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Enforced disappearances 
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>The High Commissioner urges the Ministry of Justice to continue its efforts to 
locate the remains of those who disappeared during the military dictatorships and 
return them to their families, and to ensure that the State&#8217;s confidential military 
archives from the time of the dictatorships be effectively declassified. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Security and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>The High Commissioner urges Bolivian authorities to impartially investigate 
the activities and links of those charged in relation to the alleged terrorist group in 
Santa Cruz, and to ensure to those arrested their right to a fair trial.</b> <b>She also requests 
that the allegations of excessive use of force by security officials, mentioned in the 
present report, be fully investigated by means of administrative and, if necessary, 
criminal investigations so as to determine whether the force employed was necessary, 
reasonable and proportionate. 
</b></p>
<p>114. <b>The High Commissioner recommends that the Government adopt a plan to 
prevent and sanction lynching and to take the necessary measures to ensure that cases 
of lynching are investigated promptly and those responsible sanctioned. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>The High Commissioner reiterates her call upon law enforcement authorities, 
including the judiciary, to ensure that human rights defenders enjoy full protection 
and that violations committed against them are promptly and duly investigated. </b></p>

<p><b>  Freedom of expression 
</b></p>

attacks on journalists and media operators and premises, so that they do not go 
unpunished, and to adopt adequate measures to effectively prevent further attacks, 
and calls on the Government as well as departmental and municipal authorities to 
respect and guarantee freedom of expression at all times. 
</b></p>
<p>117. <b>The High Commissioner recommends that the Plurinational Legislative 
Assembly eliminate the crime of contempt for legally constituted authorities from 
Bolivia&#8217;s criminal legislation.

<p><b>  Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>118. <b>The High Commissioner encourages the Government to continue promoting 
social programmes aimed at improving the population&#8217;s access to health and 
education, particularly in rural areas. 
</b></p>
<p>119. <b>The High Commissioner calls on the authorities, as a matter of urgency, to put 
an end to the forced labour of children. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  National Human Rights Action Plan 
</b></p>
<p>120. <b>The High Commissioner welcomes the measures undertaken in the first year of 
implementation of the National Human Rights Action Plan and calls on the State to 
approve an adequate budgetary provision for the implementation of the Plan and for 
a greater coordination and cooperation of State entities within the National 
Development Plan framework.
