reported in the first half of the year. The Company has now achieved 1,443,585 hours up to 30 June 2016 without a 
LTI since operations commenced.
The  first  half  of  2016  has  seen  another  solid  performance  at  the  Tormin  Mineral  Sands  Project.  The  following  key 
production and sales metrics were achieved in the first half of 2016.

Mineral Commodities Ltd 
Half-Year Financial Report – 30 June 2016
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
Tormin Mineral Sands Project (continued)
Replenishment  of  the  beach  continued  to  occur  during  the  period.  The  Company  continues  to  monitor  the 
replenishment cycle and deposition and will adjust mining rates to facilitate optimised replenishment cycles.
Since the commencement of  operations, mining production totaling 3.6 million tonnes has occurred. This is in excess 
of  the  stated  initial  2.7  million  tonnes  Indicated  Resource  which  existed  at  the  commencement  of  operations  in 
January 2014, and the Inferred Resources of 2.7 million tonnes at the end of both 2014 and 2015.
Overall  concentrate  production  for  the  period  was  down  on  budget  due  to  lower  recoveries,  availability  and 
throughput  in  the  SCP  primarily  due  to  ongoing  issues  with  the  primary  and  secondary  magnetic  separation  units. 
Lower  recoveries  are  expected  to  continue  in  the  second  half  of  the  year  due  to  dilution  in  grade  in  the 
replenishment cycle.
Immediately  subsequent  to  the  period  end,  the  Company  advised  that  its  South  African  subsidiary  Mineral 
Sands  Resources  (SA)  Pty  Ltd  (“MSR”)  had  completed  the  installation  and  commissioning  of  the  Garnet  Stripping 
Plant (“GSP”), installed at the front of the existing Secondary Concentrate Plant (“SCP”).  The installation of the GSP is 
expected to increase the non-magnetic zircon/rutile feed grade to the SCP by removing the garnet fraction from the 
Heavy  Mineral  Concentrate  (“HMC”)  prior  to  the  SCP.    This,  in  turn,  will  allow  a  higher-grade  non-magnetic 
concentrate  to  be  fed  to  the  existing  magnetic  circuit,  and  thereby  increase  overall  final  zircon/rutile  concentrate 
production.
Zircon pricing continues to stabilise with pubic announcements by large producers that incremental pricing of  zircon 
has  occurred  despite  large  rebates  being  offered  on  a  CIF  basis  to  Chinese  clients.  The  Company has managed to 
obtain small price increases for its zircon/rutile concentrate in Q3, 2016.
There  was  no  garnet  sales  for  the  period  due  to  the  Company  previously  delivering  its  maximum  committed 
annual  July  to  June  off-take  production  of  210,000  tonnes  under  the  GMA  off-take  agreement.  Sales  of  garnet 
concentrate  will recommence in Q3, 2016.
The  Company  managed  to  sell  small  containerised  ilmenite  concentrate  tonnages  during  the  last  quarter  of  the 
period. Whilst the  Company  was  in  a  position  to  consummate  bulk  ilmenite  shipments,  no  sales  were  made  as 
the  prospective pricing did not meet the Company’s profit margin requirements.
There  is  increasing  signs  of  a  pickup  in  the  titanium  concentrate  and  finished  ilmenite  product  markets  globally,  in 
particular  China,  which  has  resulted  in  a  higher  level  of  ilmenite  concentrate  pricing  and  supply  enquiries.  The 
Company continues to negotiate with parties on sales of larger bulk ilmenite concentrate shipments.
The  planned  mobilisation  of  offshore  sampling  during  the  period  was  delayed  due  to  various  issues  relating  to  the 
finalisation  of  the  construction  of  the  specialised  offshore  sampling  equipment.    It  is  expected  that  this  activity  will 
now commence in Q3, 2016.
The  Company  advised  that  its  application  for  Prospecting  Rights  WC30/5/1/2/10226  PR,  along  the  beach  and  surf 
zone  north  of  its  current  mining  operations,  referred  to  in  the  ASX  announcement  of  10  November  2015,  and 
WC30/5/1/1/2/10229  PR,  adjacent  and  inland  from  the  current  mining  operations,  have  been  refused  by  the 
Department of Mineral Resources. The Company has lodged an appeal against the decisions.
During the half year, the Company applied for another prospecting permit WC 30/5/1/1/2/10229 PR  covering the De 
Punt Farm and Lot 615, directly adjoining the Company’s Geelwal farm holding, covering an area of 4,495.4 hectares.
The  Company  continues  to  compile  historical  geological  data  in  relation  to  the  potential  of  onshore  heavy mineral 
strand  line  occurrences.    The  Company  is  also  reviewing  further  synergistic  land  and  tenement  acquisitions  in  the 
areas adjacent to its current Tormin operations.

Mineral Commodities Ltd 
Half-Year Financial Report – 30 June 2016
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
Tormin Mineral Sands Project (continued)
In  addition,  based  on  the  Company’s  interpretation  of  extensive  historical  exploration  work,  it  is  considering 
expediting access to the resources by lodging mining rights over all of its current prospecting tenure, including the 
areas that are under Appeal.
Xolobeni Mineral Sands Project
Subsequent  to  the  period  end,  the  Company  advised  that  it  had  entered  into  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding 
(“MOU”)  with  its  Black  Economic  Empowerment  (“BEE”)  Partner  for  the  Xolobeni  Mineral  Sands  Project,  Keysha 
Investments 178 Pty Ltd (“Keysha”), to divest its 56% interest in Transworld Energy and Resources (SA) Pty Ltd (“TEM”), 
the entity which owns the Xolobeni Project, to Keysha on terms to be agreed between the parties.
The  Company  has  committed  significant  financial,  technical  and  social  resources  toward  the  development  of  the 
Xolobeni  Project  since  2003.  Throughout  the  past  thirteen  years,  the  Company  has  successfully  worked  within  the 
regulatory  development  framework.  The  Company  has  engaged  in  many  years  of  ongoing  and  meaningful 
consultations  with  the  local  community  at  Xolobeni,  and  has  always  prioritised  the  wellbeing  of  the  Amadiba 
Community.
The  Company  has  accepted  that  attempts  to  facilitate  peaceful  and  safe  site  access  by  independent  environmental 
consultants  to  adequately  assess  the  possible  environmental  impacts  of  the  Xolobeni  Project  continued  to  cause 
undue tensions and conflict, which the Company has openly tried to avoid. The Company has, and always will have an 
ambition to bring prosperity and economic upliftment to the  local Amadiba Pondo land inhabitants and the greater 
Mbizana  district,  and  continues  to  believe  that  the  Xolobeni  Project  offers  significant  value  to  enable  economic 
upliftment.
In  light  of  the  ongoing  violence  and  threats  to  the  peace  and  harmony  of  the  local  Xolobeni  community,  the 
Company  accepts  that  the  future  viability  of  the  Xolobeni  Project  should  be  managed  by  stakeholders  and 
organisations exclusively owned by South African people.
As  such  and  after  due  consideration,  the Company  decided,  subject  to  satisfactory  commercial  negotiations, 
agreement with the other remaining shareholder, and any regulatory or shareholder approvals that may be required, 
to  divest  of  its  interest  in  the  Xolobeni  Project.  Accordingly,  the  Company  announced  that  the  Company  and  its 
wholly  owned  subsidiary  MRC  Resources  Pty  Ltd  (“MRCR”)  has  entered  into  an  MOU  with  its  BEE  partner,  Keysha, 
for the sale of the Company’s shareholding interest in TEM.
The  decision  was  made  after  extensive  consultation  with  Keysha,  who  shares  the  view  that  the  development  of  the 
Xolobeni Project, is critical to the social and economic upliftment of the local Amadiba Pondo land inhabitants, and 
the  greater  Mbizana  district,  and  that  the  Xolobeni  Project’s  development should  not  be influenced  directly  or 
indirectly  by  the  stakeholder  focus  being  placed  on  an  international  mining  company,  as  opposed  to  legitimate 
debate surrounding the economic benefits (or otherwise), and the environmental issues concerning the development 
of the Xolobeni Project.
The Company fully supports the ongoing development of the Xolobeni Project and its decision to divest is in no way a 
reflection  of  its  commitments  of  its  mining  interests  in  South  Africa.    Further  details  of  the  terms  of  the  proposed 
divestment in the Xolobeni Project will be notified upon signing of definitive sale agreements.
The Company continues to invest in and operate the Tormin Mineral Sands Operation (“Tormin”) on the West Coast 
of South Africa, which currently employs over 200 local community members of the Matzikama region.   In addition, 
the Tormin operation employs 40 local members of the Amadiba Pondo region surrounding Xolobeni, which has been 
appointed  as  the  Company’s  designated  labor  sending  area  in  accordance  with  Tormin’s  Social  Labour  Plan  and 
Mining  Charter  Agreement.  The  Company  remains  dedicated  to  providing  the  training,  education  and  employment 
initiatives  to  the  local  members  of  the  Amadiba  Pondo  region,  in  addition  to  the  various  community  programmes 
such as the agricultural farming and primary livestock developments.

Mineral Commodities Ltd 
Half-Year Financial Report – 30 June 2016
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
1.
Basis of preparation
These general purpose financial statements for the interim half-year reporting period ended 30 June 2016 have been 
prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standard 134 "Interim Financial Reporting" and the Corporations 
Act 2001.
It is recommended that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements for the 
year  ended  31  December  2015  and  any  public  announcements  made  by  Mineral  Commodities  Ltd  during  the  half-
year in accordance with the continuous disclosure requirements arising under the Corporations Act 2001.
These  interim  financial  statements  do  not  include  all  the  notes  of  the  type  normally  included  in  annual  financial 
statements.
2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The  Group  makes  significant  estimates  and  judgements  concerning  the  future.  The  resulting  accounting  estimates 
may  not  equal  the  related  actual  results.    The  estimates  and  judgements  that  have  a  significant  risk  of  causing  a 
material  adjustment  to  the  carrying  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  within  the  next  financial  year  are  discussed 
below.
The directors evaluate estimates and judgements incorporated into the financial report based on historical knowledge 
and best available current information. Estimates assume a reasonable expectation of future events and are based on 
current trends and economic data, obtained both externally and within the Group.
Significant judgements and critical estimate in applying the entity’s accounting policies
(a) Estimation of useful lives of assets
The Group determines the estimated useful lives and related depreciation and amortisation charges for its property, 
plant and equipment and finite life intangible assets. The useful lives could change significantly as a result of technical 
innovations  or  some  other  event.  The  depreciation  and  amortisation  charge  will  increase  where  the  useful  lives  are 
less than previously estimated lives, or technically obsolete or non-strategic assets that have been abandoned or sold 
will be written off or written down.
(b) Exploration and development expenditure
Recoupment  of  the  capitalised  exploration  and  evaluation  expenditure  is  dependent  on  either  the  successful 
development  and  commercial  exploitation  of  the  Xolobeni  Mineral  Sands  area  of  interest  in  South  Africa  or  the 
settlement  of  the  proposed  transaction,  as  announced  to  the  Australian  Securities  Exchange  (“ASX”)  subsequent  to 
balance  date,  to  divest  of  the  Company’s  interest  in  Transworld  Energy  and  Resources  (SA)  Pty  Ltd  (“TEM”),  which 
owns the Xolobeni Mineral Sands Project.
The proposed transaction has not been classified as held for sale in accordance with AASB 5 as at 30 June 2016, as it 
is not highly probable that the transaction will complete due to required regulatory approvals, stage of negotiation of 
the consideration and involvement of a third party who holds shares in TEM.
(c) Reserves and resources
In  order  to  calculate  ore  reserves  and  mineral  resources,  estimates  and  assumptions  are  required  about  a  range  of 
geological,  technical  and  economic  factors,  including  quantities,  grades,  production  techniques,  recovery  rates, 
production costs, transport costs, commodity demand, commodity prices and exchange rates. The Group estimates its 
ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by Competent Persons (as defined in accordance 
with  the  Australasian  Code  for  Reporting  of  Exploration  Results,  Mineral  Resources  and  Ore  Reserves  as  revised  in 
2012 (the JORC code).

Half-Year Financial Report – 30 June 2016
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements (continued)
Reserves and resources (continued)
As economic assumptions used to estimate reserves change and as additional geological data is generated during the 
course  of  operations,  estimates  of  reserves  and  mineral  resources  may  vary  from  period  to  period.  Changes  in 
reported reserves and mineral resources may affect the Group’s financial results and financial position in a number of 
ways, including the following:



Asset carrying values may be affected due to changes in estimated future cash flows;
Depreciation and amortisation charges in profit or loss may change where such charges are determined by
the units of production basis, or where the useful economic lives of assets change; and
Restoration  and  rehabilitation  provision  may  be  affected  due  to  changes  in  the  magnitude  of  future
restoration and rehabilitation expenditure.
(d) Recovery of deferred tax assets
Deferred  tax  assets  has  been  recognised  for  deductible  temporary  differences  as  the  Group  considers  that  it  is 
probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.
(e) Rehabilitation provision
A  provision  has  been  made  for  the  present  value  of  anticipated  costs  for  future  rehabilitation  of  land  explored  or 
mined.  The  Group’s  mining  and  exploration  activities  are  subject  to  various  laws  and  regulations  governing  the 
protection of the environment. The Group recognises management's best estimate for assets retirement obligations 
and site rehabilitations in the period in which they are incurred. Actual costs incurred in the future periods could differ 
materially  from  the  estimates.  Additionally,  future  changes  to  environmental  laws  and  regulations,  life  of  mine 
estimates and discount rates could affect the carrying amount of this provision.

Contingent assets and contingent liabilities
a)
Contingent assets

terms  of  which,  Blastrite  sought,  inter  alia,  an  order  that:  (a)  MSR  not  deal  with  any  entity  or  person  other 
than  Blastrite  in  relation  to  the  discussion  and  consideration  by  the  parties  of  ideas,  plans  products,

rate  for  the  term  of  the  option.  The  total  share  based  payment  expense  for  the  period  ended  30  June  2016  was

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REVIEW REPORT
To the members of Mineral Commodities Ltd
Report on the Half-Year Financial Report
We have reviewed the accompanying half-year financial report of Mineral Commodities Ltd, which 
comprises the consolidated balance sheet as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated income statement, the 
consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the half-
year ended on that date, notes comprising a statement of accounting policies and other explanatory 
information, and the directors’ declaration of the consolidated entity comprising the company and the 
entities it controlled at the half-year’s end or from time to time during the half-year.
Directors’ Responsibility for the Half-Year Financial Report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the half-year financial report that 
gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 
2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of 
the half-year financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the half-year financial report based on our review. We 
conducted our review in accordance with Auditing Standard on Review Engagements ASRE 2410 Review 
of a Financial Report Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, in order to state whether, 
on the basis of the procedures described, we have become aware of any matter that makes us believe 
that the half-year financial report is not in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 including: giving 
a true and fair view of the consolidated entity’s financial position as at 30 June 2016 and its 
performance for the half-year ended on that date; and complying with Accounting Standard AASB 134 
Interim Financial Reporting and the Corporations Regulations 2001. As the auditor of Mineral 
Commodities Ltd, ASRE 2410 requires that we comply with the ethical requirements relevant to the 
audit of the annual financial report.
A review of a half-year financial report consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible 
for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is 
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards 
and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant 
matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Independence
In conducting our review, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations 
Act 2001. We confirm that the independence declaration required by the Corporations Act 2001, which 
has been given to the directors of Mineral Commodities Ltd, would be in the same terms if given to the 
directors as at the time of this auditor’s review report.
BDO Audit (WA) Pty Ltd ABN 79 112 284 787 is a member of a national association of independent entities which are all members of BDO Australia Ltd ABN 77 050 110 275,

Conclusion
Based on our review, which is not an audit, we have not become aware of any matter that makes us 
believe that the half-year financial report of Mineral Commodities Ltd is not in accordance with the 
Corporations Act 2001 including:
(a) giving a true and fair view of the consolidated entity’s financial position as at 30 June 2016 and of
its performance for the half-year ended on that date; and
(b) complying with Accounting Standard AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting and Corporations
Regulations 2001.
