<p><b>IMPLEMENTATION OF GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION 60/251 
OF 15 MARCH 2006 ENTITLED &#8220;HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human rights in the occupied Syrian Golan 
</b></p>
<p><b>Report of the Secretary-General</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p>1. At its second session, the Human Rights Council adopted resolution 2/3 entitled &#8220;Human 
Rights in the occupied Syrian Golan&#8221;.  In paragraph 6 of the resolution, the Council requested 
the Secretary-General to bring the resolution to the attention of all Governments, the competent 
United Nations organs, the specialized agencies, international and regional intergovernmental 
organizations and international humanitarian organizations and to give it the widest possible 
publicity, and to report on this matter to the Human Rights Council at its fourth session, due to 
be held from 12 March to 5 April 2007. 
</p>
<p>2. In accordance with this request, the Secretary-General, in a note verbale 
dated 6 December 2006, brought Council resolution 2/3 to the attention of all Governments, 
including those which are members of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices 
Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied 
Territories and also of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian 
People. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*  The present report is submitted after the deadline so as to reflect recent information.

</p>
<p>3. Furthermore, the resolution was transmitted to all the specialized agencies and to the 
United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.  In addition, 
the resolution was brought to the attention of competent regional intergovernmental 
organizations and international humanitarian organizations. 
</p>
<p>4. The related activities undertaken by the Department of Public Information and 
United Nations Information Centres and Services have been listed in detail in paragraphs 7-13 of 
the report on the work of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the 
Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories submitted 
by the Secretary-General to the sixty-first session of the General Assembly (A/61/330). 
</p>
<p>5. In a note verbale dated 8 January 2007 addressed to the Office of the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights, the Permanent Mission of Cuba to the Office of the United Nations at Geneva 
indicated that, while the Government of Cuba recognized the efforts deployed by the 
United Nations to end the military occupation by the Israeli forces of the occupied Syrian Golan, 
its occupation of Arab territories continued, as did the expansion of Jewish settlements.  The 
Government of Cuba reiterated the inalienable right of the Syrian Arab Republic to the 
Golan Heights and urged the unconditional withdrawal of the territory by the occupying Power.  
There would be no just and lasting peace in the Middle East without the withdrawal by Israel 
from all the occupied Territories, including the occupied Syrian Golan, to the 1967 border. 
</p>
<p>6. In addition, the Government of Cuba referred to the XIV Summit Conference of Heads of 
State or Government of the Non-Aligned Movement held in Havana in September 2006, which 
reaffirmed the Movement&#8217;s unwavering support and solidarity with the Syrian request to restore 
the full Syrian sovereignty over the occupied Syrian Golan as emphasized by the Peace Initiative 
of Arab countries and the Madrid peace process, as well as relevant Security Council resolutions, 
and reiterated Israel&#8217;s obligation to abide by all the commitments so far pledged.  The Movement 
called on the United Nations to organize an international conference on the Middle East with the 
view to elaborating an overall, just and durable peace plan for the region with the participation of 
the permanent members of the Security Council and other interested parties, including member 
States of the Non-Aligned Movement. 
</p>
<p>7. By note verbale dated 9 January 2007, the Permanent Mission of Ecuador to the Office of 
the United Nations at Geneva acknowledged receipt of the Secretary-General&#8217;s note verbale and 
informed the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights that, in accordance with the 
request contained in paragraph 6 of Human Rights Council resolution 2/3, it had taken note of it 
and disseminated its contents. 
</p>
<p>8. The Permanent Mission of Mexico to the Office of the United Nations at Geneva 
informed the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights by note verbale dated 
12 January 2007 that it had no observations to make on the implementation of the aforesaid 
resolution. 
</p>
<p>9. In a note verbale dated 20 January 2007, the Permanent Mission of Morocco to the Office 
of the United Nations at Geneva reported that Morocco rejected all forms of Israeli practices 
that violated human rights in Palestine and all the occupied Arab territories, including the 
Golan Heights, as well as all measures that purport to alter the physical character and 
demographic composition of the occupied Arab territories.  Morocco referred to various </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/56 
 page 3 
 
</p>
<p>resolutions adopted by the League of Arab States on this issue, in which the Arab countries 
reaffirmed their support for the request of the Syrian Arab Republic to restore the Golan Heights 
in accordance with the peace process and the provisions of international law, including that 
which had been established in the framework of the Madrid Peace Conference of 1991, in 
particular resolution 6612 (125) of 4 March 2006, in which the Arab League has rejected all 
measures taken by the Israeli occupation authorities that aim at changing the legal, physical and 
demographic status of the occupied Syrian Golan, and considers them as null and void and in 
breach of international conventions and of the Charter and resolutions of the United Nations.  At 
its ordinary session, held at the ministerial level in Cairo in September 2006, the Council of the 
League of Arab States reaffirmed the Arab countries&#8217; solidarity with the Syrian Arab Republic 
and their support for the Arab citizens in the Golan in their efforts to preserve their land and 
Arab Syrian identity, and condemned all practices that constituted a flagrant violation of their 
rights.  Morocco, therefore, supports all resolutions and decisions of the United Nations 
denouncing the Israeli practices which violate human rights in the occupied Arab territories and 
which aim at suppressing the identity of its people. 
</p>
<p>10. Finally, by letter dated 5 January 2007, the International Labour Office (ILO) drew 
attention to paragraphs 52 to 59, 110 and 122 of the Appendix to the Director-General&#8217;s report to 
the International Labour Conference in 2006, entitled &#8220;The situation of workers of the Occupied 
Arab Territories&#8221;, which the ILO has always considered to include the occupied Syrian Golan.
