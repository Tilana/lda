<p><b>Human Rights Council 
Twenty-ninth session 
</b></p>
<p>Agenda item 3 
</p>
<p><b>Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council on 2 July 2015 
</b></p>
<p><b>  29/3.  Human rights and international solidarity 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> all previous resolutions and decisions adopted by the Commission on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights and the Human Rights Council on the issue of human rights and 
</p>
<p>international solidarity, including Commission resolution 2005/55 of 20 April 2005 and 
</p>
<p>Council resolutions 6/3 of 27 September 2007, 7/5 of 27 March 2008, 9/2 of 24 September 
</p>
<p>2008, 12/9 of 1 October 2009, 15/13 of 30 September 2010, 17/6 of 16 June 2011, 18/5 of 
</p>
<p>29 September 2011, 21/10 of 27 September 2012, 23/12 of 13 June 2013 and 26/6 of 
</p>
<p>26 June 2014, 
</p>
<p><i>Underlining</i> the fact that the processes of promoting and protecting human rights 
</p>
<p>should be conducted in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations and international law, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that, at the World Conference on Human Rights, held in June 1993, States 
</p>
<p>pledged to cooperate with each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to 
</p>
<p>development, and stressed that the international community should promote effective 
</p>
<p>international cooperation for the realization of the right to development and the elimination 
</p>
<p>of obstacles to development, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the fact that article 4 of the Declaration on the Right to Development 
</p>
<p>states that sustained action is required to promote more rapid development of developing 
</p>
<p>countries and, as a complement to the efforts of developing countries, effective 
</p>
<p>international cooperation is essential in order to provide these countries with the 
</p>
<p>appropriate means and facilities to foster their comprehensive development, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the attention paid to the importance of international solidarity as a 
</p>
<p>vital component of the efforts of developing countries to realize the right to development of 
</p>
<p>their peoples and to promote the full enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights by 
</p>
<p>everyone has been insufficient, and in this context, reaffirming the critical relevance of 
</p>
<p>international solidarity to the post-2015 development agenda, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the fact that the widening gap between economically developed and 
</p>
<p>developing countries is unsustainable and that it impedes the realization of human rights in 
</p>
<p>the international community and makes it all the more imperative for every nation, 
</p>
<p>according to its capacities, to make the maximum possible effort to close this gap, 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> the crucial importance of increasing the resources allocated for 
</p>
<p>official development assistance, recalling the pledge of industrialized countries to allocate 
</p>
<p>0.7 per cent of their gross national product for official development assistance, and 
</p>
<p>recognizing the need for new and additional resources to finance the development 
</p>
<p>programmes of developing countries, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming further</i> the fact that the achievement of the Millennium Development 
</p>
<p>Goals and the realization of the right to development call for a more enlightened approach, 
</p>
<p>mindset and action based on a sense of community and international solidarity, 
</p>
<p><i>Determined</i> to take new steps forward in the commitment of the international 
</p>
<p>community with a view to achieving substantial progress in human rights endeavours 
</p>
<p>through an increased and sustained effort of international cooperation and solidarity, 
</p>
<p><i>Asserting</i> the necessity of establishing new, equitable and global links of partnership 
</p>
<p>and intra-generational solidarity for the perpetuation of humankind, 
</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i> to strive to ensure that present generations are fully aware of their 
</p>
<p>responsibilities towards future ones, and that a better world is possible for both present and 
</p>
<p>future generations, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Reaffirms</i> the recognition set forth in the declaration adopted by the Heads of 
</p>
<p>State and Government at the Millennium Summit of the fundamental value of solidarity to 
</p>
<p>international relations in the twenty-first century in stating that global challenges must be 
</p>
<p>managed in a way that distributes costs and burdens fairly, in accordance with the basic 
</p>
<p>principles of equity and social justice, and that those who suffer or benefit least deserve 
</p>
<p>help from those who benefit most; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Also reaffirms</i> that international solidarity is not limited to international 
</p>
<p>assistance and cooperation, aid, charity or humanitarian assistance; it is a broader concept 
</p>
<p>and principle that includes sustainability in international relations, especially international 
</p>
<p>economic relations, the peaceful coexistence of all members of the international 
</p>
<p>community, equal partnerships and the equitable sharing of benefits and burdens; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Reiterates</i> <i>its determination</i> to contribute to the solution of current world 
</p>
<p>problems through increased international cooperation, to create conditions that will ensure 
</p>
<p>that the needs and interests of future generations are not jeopardized by the burden of the 
</p>
<p>past, and to hand over a better world to future generations; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Reaffirms</i> the fact that the promotion of international cooperation is a duty for 
</p>
<p>States, that it should be implemented without any conditionality and on the basis of mutual 
</p>
<p>respect, in full compliance with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations, in particular respect for the sovereignty of States, and taking into account national 
</p>
<p>priorities; 
</p>
<p>5.<i> Recognizes</i> that international solidarity shall be a new foundational principle 
</p>
<p>underpinning contemporary international law, that responds to the need for transformative 
</p>
<p>change encompassing the objectives of equity, equality in outcome, sustainability, security, 
</p>
<p>social justice and empowerment and is applicable to all countries, both developing and 
</p>
<p>developed; 
</p>
<p>6.<i> Also recognizes</i> that there is an overwhelming manifestation of solidarity by 
</p>
<p>States, individually and collectively, by civil society, by global social movements and by 
</p>
<p>countless people of goodwill reaching out to others, and that this solidarity is commonly 
</p>
<p>practised at the national, regional and international levels; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Acknowledges</i> the increased need for States and other actors to come together 
</p>
<p>and take collective action in solidarity; </p>


<p>8. <i>Welcomes</i> the report of the Independent Expert on human rights and 
</p>
<p>international solidarity1 and the work conducted by her; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Requests</i> all States, United Nations agencies, other relevant international 
</p>

</p>
<p>Expert in her mandate, and to supply all necessary information requested by her, and 
</p>
<p>requests States to give serious consideration to responding favourably to the requests of the 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert to visit their countries, to enable her to fulfil her mandate effectively; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Requests </i>the Independent Expert to continue to participate in relevant 
</p>
<p>international forums and major events with a view to promoting the importance of 
</p>
<p>international solidarity, inter alia, those relating to climate change, international migration, 
</p>
<p>disaster risk reduction and the post-2015 development agenda, and invites Member States, 
</p>
<p>international organizations, United Nations agencies and other relevant organizations to 
</p>
<p>facilitate the meaningful participation of the Independent Expert in these international 
</p>
<p>forums and major events; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Reiterates</i> <i>its requests </i>to the Independent Expert to consolidate and consider 
</p>
<p>the outputs from all the regional consultations on the proposed draft declaration on the right 
</p>
<p>of peoples and individuals to international solidarity, to submit to the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council, at its thirty-second session, a report on those consultations, and to submit to the 
</p>
<p>Council and the General Assembly, before the end of her second term, a revised draft 
</p>
<p>declaration; 
</p>
<p>12.<i> Requests </i>the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner

</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>outcomes of all major United Nations and other global summits and ministerial meetings in 
</p>

</p>
<p>governmental organizations in the discharge of her mandate;
