</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The present report provides a critical review of the work and activities of the second 
Special Rapporteur on the adverse effects of the movement and dumping of toxic and 
dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights, Okechukwu Ibeanu. It 
consists of three substantive parts. 
 The first part reviews the scope of the mandate vis-&#224;-vis the norms, standards and 
principles developed in the field of environmental law to regulate the production, 
management, trade and disposal of toxic and dangerous products and wastes. It also 
identifies several areas of continued focus for the mandate, as well as two emerging issues 
that would need to be carefully studied from a human rights perspective. 
 The second part provides a critical analysis of the current methods of work of the 
mandate holder in order to assess to what extent the structure of the mandate is appropriate 
to enable the Special Rapporteur to carry out the functions described in Human Rights 
Council resolution 9/1.  
 The final part contains a set of concrete recommendations to the Human Rights 
Council and the new mandate holder on how to strengthen the mandate of the Special 
Rapporteur in order to maximize the protection of those individuals and communities that 
may be adversely affected by the movement and disposal of hazardous products and 
wastes. 
</p>
<p> In particular, the mandate holder recommends that the Council expand the mandate 
of the Special Rapporteur, so as to request him/her to monitor the adverse effects of 
hazardous products and wastes during the whole life cycle, from their production to their 
disposal. He also suggests that the Council request the new mandate holder to develop a set 
of guidelines on human rights-based approaches to the sound management and disposal of 
toxic and dangerous products and wastes.

</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 
9/1, which requested the Special Rapporteur &#8220;to continue to undertake, in consultation with 
the relevant United Nations bodies, organizations and the secretariats of relevant 
international conventions, a global, multidisciplinary and comprehensive study of existing 
problems and new trends in, and solutions to, the adverse effects of the trafficking and 
dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on human rights, (...) with a view to 
making concrete recommendations and proposals on adequate measures to control, reduce 
and eradicate these phenomena&#8221; (para. 4). 
</p><p>2. The report seeks to provide a critical review of the work and activities undertaken by 
the current Special Rapporteur since his appointment in July 2004. It consists of three 
substantive parts: the first part reviews the scope of the mandate vis-&#224;-vis the norms, 
standards and principles developed in the field of international environmental law to 
regulate the management and disposal of hazardous products and wastes. It also identifies 
several areas of continued focus for the mandate, as well as two emerging issues that would 
need to be carefully studied from a human rights perspective. The second part provides a 
critical analysis of the current methods of work of the mandate holder, in order to assess to 
what extent the structure of the mandate is appropriate to enable the Special Rapporteur to 
carry out the functions described in resolution 9/1. The final part contains a set of concrete 
recommendations to the Council and the new mandate holder on how to strengthen the 
mandate of the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>3. Since this is his final annual report to the Human Rights Council, the Special 
Rapporteur would like to take this chance to express his gratitude for the opportunity to 
serve as an independent expert. He would also like to express his sincere appreciation to the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) for the 
assistance and support received. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Update on the activities of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Country missions 
</b></p>
<p>4. During the reporting period, the Special Rapporteur carried out country visits to 
Kyrgyzstan (A/HRC/15/22/Add.2) and India (A/HRC/15/22/Add.3). He wishes to express 
his gratitude for the invitations extended to him. The purpose of the mission to Kyrgyzstan 
(30 September&#8211;9 October 2009) was to examine steps undertaken by the country to 
eliminate the serious transboundary threats that uranium tailings, obsolete or banned 
pesticides and mercury waste pose to the health and the environment of countless 
individuals and communities living in Central Asia. The aim of the official visit to India 
(from 11 to 21 January 2010) was to gather first-hand information on the adverse effects 
that hazardous activities, such as shipbreaking and the recycling of electrical and electronic 
wastes (e-waste), have on the enjoyment of human rights of individuals working in these 
sectors or living close to the places where these activities take place.  </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.10-14907 
</p>
<p><b> B. Statements and interventions 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur conveyed a statement to the High Level Expert Meeting on 
the New Future of Human Rights and Environment, held in Nairobi, Kenya, from 30 
November to 1 December 2009. The statement focused on the added value of the mandate 
entrusted to the Special Rapporteur vis-&#224;-vis the treaties, guidelines, mechanisms and 
procedures adopted in the field of environmental law to regulate the sound management and 
disposal of toxic and dangerous products and wastes. It also analysed the adverse effects 
that hazardous products and wastes may have on the enjoyment of human rights, and 
highlighted the advantages of a human rights-based approach to the management and 
disposal of such products and wastes.  
</p>
<p>6. On 4 December 2009, the Special Rapporteur conveyed, along with other special 
procedures mandate holders, a message on the occasion of the United Nations Climate 
Change Conference, which took place in Copenhagen, Denmark, from 7 to 18 December 
</p><p>2009. The joint statement highlighted the serious threats that global warming posed to the 
full enjoyment of a broad range of human rights, and urged participants in the Conference 
to step up their efforts to achieve a new agreement to prevent further climate change, 
protect affected individuals from its adverse impact and lead to the formulation of global 
and national mitigation and adaptation responses based on internationally recognized 
human rights norms and standards. 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur regrets that he was unable to participate in the panel 
discussion organized by the Human Rights Council on the adverse effects of the movement 
and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human 
rights.1 The aim of the debate, which took place in Geneva on 8 June 2010, was to discuss 
existing problems, current trends, good practices and possible solutions, with a view to 
informing the future work of the Special Rapporteur. The mandate holder contributed to the 
discussion with a statement that was delivered on his behalf. The statement focused on the 
progress made and the difficulties encountered by the Special Rapporteur in carrying out 
his mandate, and recommended that the mandate be reviewed and extended in order to 
strengthen the protection of the victims of the unsound management and disposal of 
hazardous products and wastes. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Review of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Added value of the mandate 
</b></p>
<p>8. In the last two decades, an emerging body of norms, standards and principles of 
international environmental law has been developed to regulate the production, 
management, use, trade and disposal of toxic and dangerous products and wastes. This 
extensive international legal framework seeks to eliminate, or reduce to a minimum, the 
risks that these hazardous products and wastes pose to human health and the environment, 
and includes:

intact in the environment for long periods, become widely distributed geographically and accumulate 
in ecosystems, including in the fatty tissue of humans and wildlife. Exposure to POPs can lead to 
serious health effects including certain cancers, birth defects, dysfunctional immune and reproductive 
systems, greater susceptibility to disease and even diminished intelligence. The Convention entered 
into force in 2004, and has 170 parties as of 30 June 2010. </p>

</p>
<p>&#8226; The Aarhus Convention, which recognizes the right to have access to environmental 
information held by public authorities, to participate in decision-making processes 
and to have access to justice in environmental matters8 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM), which 
provides a policy framework to guide global efforts to achieve the Johannesburg 
Plan of Implementation goal that, by 2020, chemicals will be produced and used in 
ways that minimize significant adverse impacts on the environment and human 
health9 
</p>
<p>9. While it is now widely accepted that hazardous products (e.g. chemicals and 
pesticides) and wastes may pose serious threats to human health and the environment, their 
potentially adverse impact on the enjoyment of human rights has not yet been fully 
recognized. This is partly due to the fact that despite the obvious relationship between the 
goals of environmental protection and the promotion of human rights, human rights law and 
international environmental law have until recently developed in isolation from one 
another. Environmental degradation and human rights abuses have been treated as unrelated 
issues, even in cases where the links between environmental degradation and violation of 
specific human rights were evident, and distinct mechanisms and procedures have been put 
in place to address these phenomena. 
</p>
<p>10. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur was established to draw the attention of the 
international community to the adverse effects that the illicit movement and dumping of 
toxic and dangerous products and wastes have not only on the environment, but also on the 
human rights of individuals and communities that are exposed to them.10  
</p>
<p>11. In his preliminary report to the Commission on Human Rights (E/CN.4/2005/45), 
the Special Rapporteur noted that although several environmental treaties, mechanisms and 
procedures on chemicals and waste management aim to protect human health, the scope of 
their respective mandates &#8212; focusing largely on the technical and procedural aspects of the 
management, movement and disposal of hazardous products and wastes &#8212; does not extend 
to considerations of the adverse effects of illicit movement and disposal on the full range of 
existing human rights.  
</p>
<p>12. Thus, the Special Rapporteur considers that the added value of his mandate arises 
from its human rights focus. Its aim is to raise awareness of the threats that the movement 
and dumping of hazardous products and wastes pose to the enjoyment of internationally 
protected human rights, with a view to eliminating, or reducing to a minimum, such threats 
and to ensuring effective redress for victims of human rights violations related to the 
unsound management or disposal of toxic and dangerous products and wastes. By focusing 
on the human rights of the victims, the mandate complements, rather than duplicates, the 
protection afforded by the international legal framework adopted in the field of 
international environmental law.

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>8
 The Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to 
</p>
<p>Justice in Environmental Matters (the Aarhus Convention) is the first legally binding instrument 
linking environmental rights and human rights. It entered into force in 2001, and has 44 parties as of 
30 June 2010. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>9
 The Strategic Approach was adopted by the International Conference on Chemicals Management in 
</p>
<p>Dubai (United Arab Emirates) on 6 February 2006, on the basis of a consultative process that 
involved representatives of Governments, intergovernmental organizations, NGOs and the private 
sector.

<p>GE.10-14907 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Scope of the mandate 
</b></p>
<p>13. Another advantage the mandate has vis-&#224;-vis existing international environmental 
mechanisms and procedures comes from its comprehensive scope. Multilateral 
environmental treaties contain very precise definitions to delimit their scope of application, 
and are only applicable when a particular situation matches one described in their 
provisions. For instance, the applicability of the Basel Convention presupposes that a 
substance or object (1) is a waste pursuant to article 1.1 of the Convention,11 and (2) 
presents either the hazardous characteristics referred to in article 1.1 or is considered as 
&#8220;other wastes&#8221; as defined in article 1.2 of the Convention. Moreover, some categories of 
wastes &#8212; such as radioactive wastes and wastes deriving from the normal operations of a 
ship &#8212; are excluded from the scope of the Convention (articles 1.3 and 1.4).  
</p><p>14. The Special Rapporteur, on the contrary, is not bound by any specific definition, 
since neither the resolution which established the mandate nor the resolutions adopted 
thereinafter provide a definition of &#8220;toxic and dangerous products and wastes&#8221; or explain 
the meaning of the words &#8220;movement&#8221; or &#8220;dumping&#8221;. In order to maximize the protection 
of the individuals and communities whose rights may be adversely affected by these 
phenomena, the Special Rapporteur has, since the establishment of the mandate, interpreted 
the expression &#8220;toxic and dangerous products and wastes&#8221; extensively. 
</p>
<p>15. Accordingly, any object which contains hazardous substances and/or has intrinsic 
hazardous qualities (e.g. flammable, toxic, radioactive or explosive nature) likely to 
threaten the enjoyment of human rights has been taken as falling within the scope of the 
mandate, without the need to ascertain whether it constitutes &#8220;waste&#8221; (i.e. something that 
has been or is being discarded) or a &#8220;product&#8221; (i.e. something that is being traded or 
exchanged). This focus on the potential adverse effects on the enjoyment of human rights 
thus allows the Special Rapporteur to overcome the legal difficulties commonly associated 
with the definition of &#8220;hazardous products&#8221; and &#8220;toxic wastes&#8221; under international 
environmental law, and to provide greater protection to the victims of the unsound 
management or disposal of hazardous products and wastes. 
</p>
<p>16. An example of the usefulness of this comprehensive approach is provided by end-of-
life ships. Under the Basel Convention, a ship may become waste as defined in article 2 
whilst continuing to be defined as a ship under other international rules. There is thus 
uncertainty as to whether a ship containing asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) or 
heavy metals can be classified as hazardous waste when destined for recycling or disposal. 
In accordance with the broad interpretation of the expression &#8220;toxic and dangerous products 
and wastes&#8221;, the Special Rapporteur considers that in view of the hazardous substances and 
materials aboard, end-of-life vessels fall within the scope of his mandate without the need 
to establish whether they represent a &#8220;product&#8221; that is being traded or &#8220;waste&#8221; that is being 
disposed of.  
</p>
<p>17. Transboundary movement and illicit disposal of hazardous products and wastes are 
also narrowly defined in international environmental treaties. According to the Basel 
Convention, a transboundary movement of wastes presupposes that at least two States are 
involved in the movement (art. 2.3). Article 2 defines &#8220;disposal&#8221; as any operation specified 
in annex IV to this Convention, and &#8220;illegal traffic&#8221; as any transboundary movement of 
hazardous wastes or other wastes as specified in article 9. In the absence of a specific 
definition, the mandate holder has interpreted these terms extensively.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>11
 Article 2.1 of the Basel Convention defines wastes as &#8220;substances or objects which are disposed of or 
</p>
<p>are intended to be disposed of or are required to be disposed of by the provisions of national law&#8221;. </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.10-14907 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur has always considered that a movement from an area under 
the national jurisdiction of a State to or through an area under the national jurisdiction of 
another State is not necessary for an issue to fall within the scope of the mandate. An 
example of transboundary movement not involving an international trade in hazardous 
wastes is the transfer of industries generating hazardous products and/or wastes to 
developing countries. Over the years, the Special Rapporteur has considered several cases 
where transnational corporations had moved their plants to developing countries to continue 
the production of pesticides and pharmaceuticals that had been banned or severely 
restricted in industrialized countries for environmental or health reasons. 
</p>
<p>19. With regard to the &#8220;illicit&#8221; nature of activities concerning the movement and 
disposal of hazardous products and wastes, the Special Rapporteur considers that the 
adjective &#8220;illicit&#8221; does not only encompass activities carried out in violation of national or 
international norms and standards on the sound management and disposal of toxic and 
dangerous products and wastes. In his view, any movement or dumping of hazardous 
products and wastes that has, or may have, a harmful impact on the enjoyment of human 
rights may be considered &#8220;illicit&#8221;, even if it appears to be officially legal (e.g. 
transboundary movement of hazardous wastes in accordance with the provisions of the 
Basel Convention causing adverse effects on the enjoyment of the right to life or health of 
individuals handling or being exposed to them, for instance as a result of non-deliberate 
disposal).  
</p><p>20. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to note that at its ninth session, the Human Rights 
Council decided to strengthen the mandate so as to include all types of movement and 
dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes, as recommended by the mandate 
holder (see A/HRC/9/22, para. 36). In accordance with resolution 9/1, the Special 
Rapporteur now has the task of investigating the adverse effects that both transboundary 
and national movements and dumping of hazardous products and wastes have on the 
enjoyment of human rights. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur is now mandated to study 
the potential adverse effects of any movement or dumping of hazardous products and 
wastes, whether illicit or not. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Existing problems, and new trends, in the movement and dumping of 
toxic and dangerous products and wastes 
</b></p>
<p>21. Since the establishment of the mandate, significant changes have taken place in the 
transboundary movement and disposal of hazardous products and wastes. In 1995, the 
majority of transboundary movements of toxic wastes took place between industrialized 
countries, where these wastes could no longer be economically disposed of following the 
introduction of stringent legislation regulating hazardous waste disposal, and developing 
countries, in particular in Africa, which needed hard currency, but had no or limited 
technical capacity to dispose of these wastes in an environmentally sound manner. Indeed, 
the establishment of the mandate represented a response to a number of serious incidents 
involving the illicit dumping in developing countries of hazardous wastes produced in 
industrialized countries. 
</p>
<p>22. At present, the situation is more complex. Certainly, hazardous wastes generated in 
the northern hemisphere continue to be illegally dumped in developing countries when they 
cannot be disposed of in the country of origin, as the Probo Koala incident proved.12 
However, hazardous wastes are transferred not only from the &#8220;north&#8221; to the &#8220;south&#8221;, but 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>12
 The Probo Koala, a ship flying the Panamanian flag chartered by a Dutch transnational corporation, 
</p>
<p>allegedly disposed of 500 tonnes of toxic wastes in Abidjan, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. See A/HRC/12/26/Add.2. </p>


<p>GE.10-14907 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>also &#8212; and increasingly &#8212; between developing countries and between developed countries 
themselves. Although very limited statistical data on this issue exist, it appears from the 
information reported by States parties to the secretariat of the Basel Convention that the 
majority of transboundary movements occur nowadays within the same region, and involve 
industrialized countries. The amounts of wastes transferred either from one region to 
another or involving developing countries are small in comparison, although they are also 
increasing. 
</p>
<p>23. The Council itself has recognized that the management and disposal of toxic and 
dangerous products and wastes has now become a global problem. The Special Rapporteur 
is delighted to note that resolution 9/1, which extended the mandate for a further period of 
three years, was for the first time adopted by consensus. Resolution 12/18, which called for 
the organization of a panel discussion on toxic waste, was also adopted without a vote. This 
shows the serious commitment of the Human Rights Council to address the global 
challenges posed by the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous 
products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights. 
</p><p>24. In this section, the Special Rapporteur would like to highlight some issues which 
will continue to deserve the attention of the mandate in view of their scale, their potential or 
actual adverse impact on human rights and/or the lack of an adequate legal framework. He 
would also like to draw the attention of the Council to two emerging issues that would need 
to be carefully studied from a human rights perspective. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Suggested areas of continued focus 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Shipbreaking 
</b></p>
<p>25. Every year, on average, about 600 end-of-life ships containing large amounts of 
toxic and hazardous substances and materials, including asbestos, polychlorinated 
biphenyls, heavy metals, oils and fuels, are sent to the beaches of South Asia, where they 
are dismantled without concrete covering or any containment other than the hull of the ship 
itself.13 This method of ship dismantling, commonly referred to as &#8220;beaching&#8221;, generates 
significant levels of pollution of coastal soil, air, sea and groundwater resources, and 
adversely affects local communities, which often rely on agriculture and fishing for their 
subsistence. Furthermore, a great number of workers die or are seriously injured because of 
work-related accidents, or develop occupational diseases related to long-term exposure to 
hazardous materials present on end-of-life ships.  
</p>
<p>26. The adverse impact of shipbreaking on the enjoyment of human rights has been 
considered in a number of thematic and mission reports. In last year&#8217;s annual report 
(A/HRC/12/26), the Special Rapporteur provided a comprehensive analysis of this 
phenomenon and its adverse effects on the human rights of the workers in shipbreaking 
yards and those living in proximity of the yards. The report described the efforts undertaken 
by the international community to develop a legal framework to address these serious 
concerns, and focused, in particular, on the Hong Kong International Convention for the 
Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships, adopted under the auspices of the 
International Maritime Organization (IMO) in May 2009.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>13
 Due to the IMO phase-out of single-hull tankers and the global economic downturn, a greater number 
</p>
<p>of ships are expected to be sent for scrapping in the coming years. In 2009, the total number of ships 
scrapped was over 1,200 (see N. Cotzias Shipping, Economic Outlook Report, February 2010), and it 
is expected that this figure will be matched, or exceeded, in 2010. </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.10-14907 
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur considers that the extremely poor working practices and 
environmental conditions prevailing in most shipbreaking yards would continue to require 
the attention of the mandate holder. Although the Hong Kong Convention represents a 
positive step towards creating an enforceable regulatory regime to minimize the risks that 
shipbreaking poses to human health and the environment, the Special Rapporteur is of the 
view that the Convention alone is not sufficient to bring about significant improvements in 
the working practices prevailing in shipbreaking yards or in the elimination of the serious 
environmental pollution that the yards generate.  
</p>
<p>28. In May 2010, the seventh session of the Open-ended Working Group of the Basel 
Convention developed criteria to be used to determine whether the Hong Kong Convention 
establishes a level of control and enforcement equivalent to that established under the Basel 
Convention, and invited States and other relevant stakeholders to submit their preliminary 
assessments to the secretariat of the Basel Convention by 15 April 2011.14 The tenth 
meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Basel Convention (COP-10), to be held in 
October 2011, is expected to consider these preliminary assessments. It is not yet certain 
whether parties will finalize their deliberations on the matter of equivalency at COP-10, or 
whether this issue will be referred to a later meeting. 
</p>
<p><b>  E-waste 
</b></p>
<p>29. Electrical and electronic wastes, commonly referred to as e-waste, encompass a 
broad and growing list of loosely discarded, obsolete or broken electrical and electronic 
equipment, such as old mobile phones, computers, refrigerators and television sets. Because 
of the rapid changes in technology, people are upgrading their electrical and electronic 
equipment more frequently than ever before. The number of electrical and electronic 
products discarded globally has increased dramatically recently, with 20&#8211;50 million tonnes 
generated every year, i.e. roughly 5 per cent of all municipal solid waste produced 
worldwide.15 It is estimated that in Europe e-waste is increasing at 3 to 5 per cent a year, 
and that developing countries are also expected to triple their e-waste production over the 
next five years. 
</p>
<p>30. Mobile phones and computing equipment are causing the biggest problem, since 
they are replaced most often. 314.7 million mobile phones were sold worldwide in the first 
quarter of 2010, a 17 per cent increase on the same period in 2009.16 According to recent 
statistics, mobile phones now have a life cycle of less than two years in developed 
countries. A total of 366.1 million computers are expected to be sold in 2010, a 19.7 per 
cent increase on the 305.8 million units shipped in 200917 and their average lifespan in 
developed countries has dropped from six years in 1997 to two to five years in 2010. 
</p>
<p>31. Electronic and electrical appliances contain hundreds of different substances, many 
of which are highly toxic and pose significant risks to human health and the environment if 
they are not managed and disposed of in an environmentally sound manner. In developing 
countries, the vast majority of obsolete electrical and electronic equipment is dismantled in 
small-scale, informal workshops that separate their various components (i.e. plastic, ferrous 
metals, non-ferrous metals, glass) for recycling or reuse. During the process of breaking 
down old computers and other high-tech devices, workers are exposed to hazardous

<p>substances, including toxic heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, beryllium and mercury, 
hazardous chemicals, such as brominated flame retardants, and other toxic plastic additives. 
Furthermore, unusable parts are usually disposed of in landfills or burned, causing 
widespread and long-lasting contamination of soil, air and surface and groundwater 
resources.  
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur has considered on a number of occasions the adverse effects 
that the unsound management and disposal of e-waste may have on the enjoyment of 
human rights (see most recently A/HRC/15/22/Add.3). In particular, he has documented the 
practice of circumventing the application of the Basel Convention by means of the label 
&#8220;used&#8221; for the export of second-hand electrical and electronic products that have almost 
reached their end of life to developing countries. In many cases brought to his attention, 
developing countries received large quantities of products that were either not working or 
ceased to work shortly after their arrival at destination under the guise of donations or to 
address the &#8220;digital divide&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur wishes to acknowledge the efforts undertaken under the 
umbrella of the Basel Convention to promote the environmentally sound management and 
disposal of e-waste, which include the launching of the Mobile Phone Partnership 
Initiative,18 the adoption of the Nairobi Ministerial Declaration on the environmentally 
sound management of e-waste19 and the Partnership for Action on Computing Equipment 
(PACE).20 Nevertheless, he is of the view that the gaps and ambiguities in the existing 
international legal framework, and in particular the lack of a common definition and 
classification of e-waste, will not allow any significant improvement in the reduction of the 
adverse human rights impact of the transboundary movement of e-waste, and would 
therefore continue to require the attention of the mandate holder. 
</p>
<p><b>  Hazardous chemicals, including pesticides 
</b></p>
<p>34. Chemicals have become an integral part of people&#8217;s everyday lives around the 
world. Virtually every man-made product, from air fresheners to electrical appliances, from 
cosmetics to children&#8217;s toys, contains chemical substances. When produced and used in an 
environmentally sound way, chemicals bring great benefits to modern societies. They 
contribute to the eradication of poverty and diseases, the improvement of human health, the 
protection of the environment and the elevation of standards of living in countries at all 
levels of development. However, chemicals can also have a significant adverse impact on 
human health and the environment when their production and use are not managed 
responsibly. 
</p>
<p>35. Hazardous chemicals constitute a serious threat to human health and the 
environment. According to the World Bank, 355,000 people worldwide die each year from 
acute pesticide poisoning.21 Nevertheless, the problems posed by pesticides are more acute 
in developing countries, due to the large number of persons employed in the agricultural 
sector, weak or non-existent regulatory regimes and little public awareness of the potential 
health and environmental harm caused by pesticide exposure. It is reported that as many as 
25 million agricultural workers suffer serious or irreversible work-related diseases, 
including several forms of cancer, endocrine system disruption and reproductive and

<p>neurological disorders, linked to long-term exposure to hazardous pesticides.22 According 
to an authoritative British medical journal, in many parts of the developing world pesticide 
poisoning is a serious public health problem, which causes more deaths than infectious 
diseases.23 
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur has on a number of occasions considered the adverse human 
rights impact of hazardous chemicals, including pesticides. In his report to the sixty-second 
session of the Commission on Human Rights (E/CN.4/2006/42), the Special Rapporteur 
focused on the risks that chronic, low-level exposure to toxic chemicals, including 
pesticides, pose to the enjoyment of the right to life, the right to health, the right of access 
to information and participation in decision-making processes. The Special Rapporteur has 
also dealt with a number of communications concerning transnational corporations based in 
industrialized countries that continue exporting to developing countries hazardous 
chemicals that are banned in their countries of origin in view of their serious adverse effects 
on human health and the environment. 
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the progress made at the international level in the 
field of international chemicals management. At its fourth meeting, held in Geneva from 4 
to 8 May 2009, the Conference of the Parties to the Stockholm Convention decided to 
extend the scope of the Convention to include nine new chemicals, many of which are still 
widely used.24 The second session of the International Conference on Chemicals 
Management (ICCM-2) reviewed progress in the implementation of SAICM since its 
adoption in 2006, and adopted a resolution calling for appropriate action on four emerging 
policy issues that have not been generally recognized, or sufficiently addressed.25 Such 
progress, although encouraging, is not sufficient to address the main weaknesses of the 
existing international legal framework for chemical safety, and particularly the legal 
loopholes that continue to allow the transfer of polluting industries or the export to 
developing countries of hazardous chemicals that are banned or severely restricted in 
industrialized countries. Such weaknesses and the increase in the global production, trade 
and use of chemicals would continue to require the consideration of the mandate in the next 
years to come. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. New areas requiring attention 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Mercury 
</b></p>
<p>38. Mercury is a heavy metal that is widespread and persistent in the environment. It is a 
naturally occurring element and can be released into the air as vapour during natural 
processes, such as volcanic activity or forest fires, or as a result of anthropogenic activities 
such as industrial processes, mining, deforestation, waste incineration and burning of fossil 
fuels. Coal-fired power production is today deemed the single largest global source of 
atmospheric mercury emissions. Mercury in the air eventually settles into water or onto 
land where it can be washed into water. Once deposited in water, mercury bio-accumulates 
in the aquatic food chain, which may lead to high concentrations in fish, shellfish, and 
marine mammals.

<p>GE.10-14907 <b>13

<p>39. Mercury has traditionally been used to manufacture several products, including 
laboratory and medical instruments (e.g. clinical thermometers and barometers), electrical 
applications (e.g. switches and fluorescent lamps), batteries and dental amalgam. Due to its 
adverse effects on human health and the environment, many industrial and commercial uses 
of mercury are now banned, or severely restricted, in many developed countries. 
Nevertheless, mercury continues to be used in many developing countries. In particular, 
mercury is extensively used by small-scale or artisanal miners to extract gold from certain 
types of ores, as the mandate holder verified during his visit to Tanzania 
(A/HRC/9/22/Add.2). 
</p><p>40. Mercury poses significant threats to the enjoyment of the right to health. It can have 
several adverse effects on the central nervous system in adults, increase risk of 
cardiovascular disease, and cause kidney problems, miscarriages, respiratory failure, and 
even death. There is no known safe level of exposure, and effects can be seen even at very 
low levels. Mercury and its compounds cause severe irreversible damage to the brain and 
nervous system of foetuses and infants. The major source of human exposure is ingestion of 
contaminated fish and seafood. People are also exposed through inhalation of mercury 
vapour, in particular as a result of their work or for living close to a facility/industry that 
releases mercury. 
</p>
<p>41. At its twenty-fifth session, held in Nairobi, Kenya, from 16 to 20 February 2009, the 
Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) agreed to 
develop a legally-binding instrument on mercury, and requested UNEP to convene an 
intergovernmental negotiating committee with the mandate to prepare the instrument.26 The 
Committee held its first session from 7 to 11 June 2010 in Stockholm, Sweden, with the 
goal of completing its work by the twenty-seventh session of the Governing Council in 
</p><p>2013.  
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the decision of the UNEP Governing Council. 
The new instrument should aim at phasing out and eventually eliminating the use of 
mercury in products, reducing atmospheric mercury emissions from human sources and 
ensuring that mercury-containing waste is disposed of in an environmentally sound way, in 
accordance with the Basel Convention. It should also address the remediation of existing 
contaminated sites affecting public and environmental health, and contain specific 
provisions to raise awareness among affected individuals and communities of the risks 
associated with mercury exposure and the measures to adopt in order to minimize such 
risks. 
</p>
<p><b>  Lead in paint 
</b></p>
<p>43. Lead is a toxic heavy metal that was used for many years in products found in and 
around our homes, including gasoline additives, batteries and plumbing materials. Lead 
poisoning is known to cause decreases in intelligence quotient levels, retarded physical 
development, behavioural disorders, reduced attention spans and learning disabilities in 
children, even at extremely low levels of exposure. In adults, lead is linked to increased 
blood pressure, hypertension and higher risk of cardiovascular disease, as well as to 
reproductive problems, anaemia and reduced renal functions. Women exposed to lead 
during pregnancy report higher rates of miscarriages, stillbirths and preterm deliveries. 
</p>
<p>44. The concern about the adverse effects of lead on children&#8217;s intellectual abilities and 
behaviour has brought about widespread reduction in its use. In particular, global 
international efforts to phase out leaded gasoline resulted in the elimination of lead from

</p>
<p>fuels in many countries. In contrast, there has been less concerted international action to 
phase out lead in lead-based paints, which are still manufactured in many developing 
countries and used to paint the interiors and exteriors of homes or schools, as well as toys, 
furniture, playground equipment and other articles with which children come in contact. 
</p>
<p>45. Lead in paint represents one of the largest sources of lead exposure. Inhalation of 
house dust is the most common exposure pathway to lead-based paint for children and 
adults alike. Lead from exterior house paint can flake off and contaminate the air and the 
soil outside the house, including children&#8217;s play areas. Ingestion of contaminated soil, dust 
and lead-based paint chips due to hand-to-mouth activities are the most common sources of 
lead exposure in infants and young children. However, contaminated food and water also 
represent significant exposure pathways. In addition to exposure to lead-contaminated dust, 
adults are exposed to lead used in lead-based paint during the manufacture, processing and 
application of lead paint. Residential renovation and paint removal can be significant 
sources of lead exposure for workers as well as residents. Dry sanding, abrasive blasting, 
and burning, welding, or heating surfaces covered with lead paint typically generate highly 
dangerous airborne lead levels. 
</p>
<p>46. A recent study found out that 83.8 per cent of oil-based decorative paints sold in 
India contained more than 600 parts per million (ppm) of lead (which is the maximum 
allowable percentage of lead in paints to be used for residential uses or for children&#8217;s 
products), and 61.3 per cent of samples had more than 5,000 ppm.27 A similar study carried 
out in China showed that 50 per cent of new paint samples contained lead at levels equal to 
or exceeding 600 ppm.28 Although the problem is more serious in developing countries and 
economies in transition, lead-based paints remain a significant source of lead exposure and 
poisoning even in countries that have long since phased out its use. For example, in the 
United States an estimated 38 million housing units built before 1978, the year in which 
legislation banning the use of lead-based paints was adopted, have paint that contains 
lead.29 
</p>
<p>47. ICCM-2 decided to establish a global partnership to promote phasing out the use of 
lead in paints.30 The Special Rapporteur endorses this important decision, and encourages 
the new mandate holder to work closely with the Chemicals Branch of UNEP and the 
World Health Organization (WHO), which serve as the joint secretariat for this global 
partnership, to raise awareness on the adverse effects that lead-based paints may have on 
the enjoyment of the right to health of affected individuals and communities who are 
exposed to them. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Guidelines on human rights-based approaches to the sound 
management and disposal of toxic and dangerous products and wastes 
</b></p>
<p>48. It was the intention of the Special Rapporteur to terminate his mandate by 
developing a set of guidelines on human rights-based approaches to the sound management 
and disposal of toxic and dangerous products and wastes. Their purpose is to give States 
and the international community practical tools to prevent human rights violations

<p>associated with hazardous products and wastes. The guidelines should be normatively 
based on international human rights norms and standards, and consistent with international 
environmental law. They should identify the rights and fundamental freedoms that may be 
adversely affected by the movement and dumping of hazardous products and wastes and the 
corresponding responsibilities of States and other actors. 
</p>
<p>49. During the twelfth session of the Council, the Special Rapporteur held a number of 
bilateral meetings with interested delegations to explore the possibility of receiving a 
specific mandate in this regard. Although some delegations expressly supported the 
development of such guidelines during the interactive dialogue, resolution 12/18 only 
called for the organization of a panel discussion on the adverse effects of the movement and 
dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights, 
with a view to informing the future work of the Special Rapporteur.31 
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the organization of this panel discussion, and 
encourages the Council to request the new mandate holder to develop such guidelines with 
a view to clarifying the content of the obligations that States have undertaken under 
existing human rights treaties to eliminate, or reduce to a minimum, the adverse human 
rights impact caused by the unsound management and disposal of toxic and dangerous 
products and wastes. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Review of the work of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Reports to the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>51. In previous annual reports to the Council, the Special Rapporteur provided an in-
depth analysis of selected thematic issues, chosen on the basis of such criteria as the scale 
of the phenomenon, its potential or actual adverse impact on human rights and/or the lack 
of an adequate legal framework to regulate it. At times, these reports led to controversial 
discussions. For example, a number of States challenged the Special Rapporteur in relation 
to his analysis of the shortcomings of the Hong Kong Convention on ship recycling, 
contained in last year&#8217;s report (A/HRC/12/26), while other States and NGOs welcomed his 
conclusions and recommendations on issues such as the pre-cleaning of ships and the 
gradual phasing-out of the &#8220;beaching&#8221; method. 
</p>
<p>52. Thematic reports contribute to clarifying the adverse human rights impact of 
hazardous products or activities unknown to most human rights practitioners, and to 
identifying measures that States and other actors should adopt to eliminate, or reduce to a 
minimum, the threats that such products or activities pose to the enjoyment of human 
rights. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur believes that better use could be made of the 
extensive research carried out by the mandate holder. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Country missions 
</b></p>
<p>53. During his six-year tenure, the Special Rapporteur carried out country visits to 
Ukraine, Tanzania, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the Netherlands, Kyrgyzstan and India. He is grateful to 
all Governments that responded positively to his requests for invitations. At the same time, 
he regrets that several countries have not responded to his requests or have denied him 
access to their territories, despite the repeated calls made by the Council, and previously by 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>31
 See supra, paragraph 7. </p>


<p><b>16</b> GE.10-14907 
</p>
<p>the Commission, to extend him an invitation.32 The lack of cooperation from the 
Governments on this issue, which is shown by the limited number of visits he has been able 
to undertake during his tenure, has seriously undermined the capacity of the Special 
Rapporteur to carry out his mandate. 
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate that in situ visits offer a unique 
opportunity to gather first-hand information and establish a constructive and genuine 
dialogue between the relevant Government, civil society and the Special Rapporteur on the 
progress made, and difficulties encountered, in the implementation of international human 
rights standards relating to the sound management and disposal of hazardous products and 
wastes. 
</p>
<p>55. Unlike other special procedure mechanisms, the mandate has not yet developed any 
formal mechanism for following up on country visits. The lack of such a mechanism is the 
result of a variety of factors, including the scarce financial and human resources available 
to the mandate holder and the difficulty of identifying the government agency or body 
responsible for implementing the recommendations made. Nonetheless, the Special 
Rapporteur believes that it would be desirable to develop a mechanism &#8212; which could take 
the form of a follow-up report &#8212; to assess the extent to which recommendations have been 
implemented. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Individual communications 
</b></p>
<p>56. Like most special procedures, the Special Rapporteur can receive and consider 
communications alleging human rights violations relating to movement and dumping of 
hazardous products and wastes, and intervene with Governments on behalf of the alleged 
victims. The intervention can relate to situations in which a human rights violation has 
already occurred, is ongoing, or has a likelihood of occurring. 
</p>
<p>57. The process, in general, involves the sending of a letter to the Government inviting 
comments on the allegations, seeking clarifications, reminding the Government of its 
obligations under international law and requesting information, where relevant, on steps 
being taken by the authorities to redress the situation in question. The text of 
communications sent and responses received thereon are confidential until such time as 
they are published in the communication report that the Special Rapporteur submits to the 
Council on an annual basis along with the annual report. 
</p>
<p>58. In line with recent developments in the field of corporate responsibility and 
accountability for transnational corporations and other business enterprises with regard to 
human rights, the Special Rapporteur has on some occasions entered into a direct dialogue 
with private enterprises, for example mining companies, to request information about 
human rights violations allegedly caused as a result of their acts or omissions and the 
measures adopted to eliminate or mitigate the adverse effects of their activities, including 
any compensation provided to the affected individuals and communities. 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur attaches great importance to information he receives directly 
from communities or individuals allegedly affected by movement and dumping of 
hazardous wastes and products, or from credible organizations acting on their behalf. 
Although it is difficult to assess its actual impact, the individual communication mechanism 
represents a powerful tool to strengthen the protection of the human rights of these 
individuals and communities. Such a procedure also constitutes an essential element of the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>32
 See most recently Human Rights Council resolution 9/1, para. 6. </p>


<p>GE.10-14907 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>added value of the mandate, since similar mechanisms have not been established by 
international environmental treaties on chemicals or waste management. 
</p>
<p>60. The communication procedure also presents some advantages vis-&#224;-vis judicial and 
quasi-judicial procedures established in the field of human rights law. In the first place, its 
use does not require the previous exhaustion of domestic remedies, as is the case for 
individual communications or complaints to human rights courts or treaty bodies. Secondly, 
the alleged victim(s) only need(s) to provide prima facie evidence of a human rights 
violation, and does not need to be assisted by a lawyer at any stage of the procedure. 
Thirdly, information on alleged human rights violations can be provided not only by the 
victim, as is the practice in the judicial or quasi-judicial procedures referred to above, but 
also by domestic and international NGOs acting on their behalf. 
</p>
<p>61. Follow-up to communications is essential to ensure the effectiveness of this 
procedure. The Special Rapporteur attaches great importance to maintaining a constructive 
dialogue with Governments concerned and the sources of communications on any 
developments in the situation referred to in the communication. In order to ensure that the 
procedure goes beyond a mere exchange of letters between the Special Rapporteur and the 
Government, it is particularly important that sources of information provide the mandate 
holder with updates on the cases they had brought to his attention. This enhances the 
quality of the dialogue, since the Special Rapporteur can follow up on replies provided by 
Governments in order to request further clarification or information. 
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the potential of this procedure has not been fully 
exploited. As of June 2010, the Special Rapporteur has sent, either independently or jointly 
with other special procedure mandate holders, a total of 15 allegation letters and 12 urgent 
appeals. The mandate holder believes that the limited number of communications sent 
partly depends on the fact that many human rights and environmental NGOs are not 
familiar with his mandate, and that much more needs to be done to raise awareness of the 
mandate, as well as on the communication procedure and its potential. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Collaboration with the United Nations system 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur has established solid working relations with the secretariats 
of relevant environmental treaties. He regularly exchanges information and meets with the 
secretariats of the chemicals and waste management conventions, as well as with the 
SAICM secretariat and the secretariat of the Aarhus Convention. The Special Rapporteur 
would like to take this opportunity to thank all of them for their continuous support to the 
mandate. 
</p>
<p>64. During his tenure, the Special Rapporteur participated in, or conveyed statements to, 
several sessions of the governing bodies of environmental conventions, such as the 
Meetings of the Parties to the Aarhus Convention and the Conference of the Parties to the 
Basel Convention, as well as in meetings of technical committees or bodies established by 
the Conferences/Meetings of Parties to environmental treaties, such as the Joint Working 
Group established by the IMO, the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the 
Conference of the Parties to the Basel Convention on Ship Scrapping. He also participated 
actively in the development and implementation of the SAICM. 
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur considers that the collaboration with the secretariats of 
environmental conventions and their political bodies is of vital importance for the mandate. 
It provides a useful opportunity to establish or strengthen synergies with these 
organizations and to mainstream a human rights-based approach in their work by raising 
awareness on the adverse impact that the movement and dumping of hazardous products 
and wastes may have on the enjoyment of human rights. </p>


<p><b>18</b> GE.10-14907 
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur believes that closer and more coordinated collaboration is 
needed between his mandate, UNEP and relevant United Nations specialized agencies, such 
as ILO and WHO. Their organizations have developed significant expertise on issues 
falling within the scope of the mandate, such as the management of hazardous chemicals 
and pesticides, and the Special Rapporteur would greatly benefit from strengthened 
collaboration. This collaboration would also facilitate the mainstreaming of human rights in 
the work of these organizations, and result in better coordination and response to human 
rights violations related to the movement and dumping of hazardous products and wastes. 
</p>
<p>67. Similarly, the mandate holder is of the view that collaboration with other mandate 
holders and treaty bodies could be strengthened. The Special Rapporteur has sent a number 
of joint urgent appeals and allegation letters with other mandate holders, but would 
welcome a more coordinated approach with other relevant human rights mechanisms, such 
as the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health and the Committee on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights. Enhanced cooperation would result in better follow-up on 
recommendations of these mechanisms and greater support for countries in their efforts to 
consider these recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Collaboration with civil society 
</b></p>
<p>68. Civil society is one of the most important sources of information about the factual 
situation existing at the country level with regard to the management and disposal of 
hazardous products and wastes. In almost all the countries visited by the mandate holder, 
NGOs provided an essential contribution before, during and after the official mission, both 
with regard to providing information on the human rights impact of toxic and dangerous 
products and wastes and facilitating access to relevant sites. The Special Rapporteur wishes 
to take this opportunity to express once again his deepest gratitude to all NGOs which 
contributed to the organization of his country visits. 
</p>
<p>69. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur believes that there is room for strengthened 
collaboration between the mandate and civil society organizations. In particular, he 
considers that more regular exchanges of information with environmental NGOs, in 
particular those working on chemicals and waste management, would allow the Special 
Rapporteur to be better informed about recent trends and new developments in the 
management and disposal of hazardous products and wastes. As noted elsewhere in this 
report, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that NGOs have not made full use of the 
individual communication procedure to seek redress for human rights violations related to 
chemicals and waste management. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>70. <b>In the last six years as mandate holder, the Special Rapporteur witnessed 
significant changes in the transboundary movement and disposal of hazardous 
products and wastes. Although hazardous wastes generated in industrialized countries 
continue to be moved across borders and illegally dumped in developing countries, 
and in spite of the lack of complete and reliable information in this respect, it appears 
that the majority of transboundary movements occur nowadays within the same 
region, and generally involve industrialized countries. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>The Human Rights Council itself has recognized that the movement and 
disposal of toxic and dangerous products and wastes have now become global 
problems, which require global solutions. Resolution 9/1, which strengthened the </b></p>


<p>GE.10-14907 <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>mandate of the Special Rapporteur so as to include all types of movement and 
dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes, is the first response to these 
changes. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>In view of the fact that the many human rights violations related to toxic and 
dangerous products and wastes derive from their inappropriate generation, 
management or use, rather than from their &#8220;movement&#8221; or &#8220;disposal&#8221;, the Special 
Rapporteur recommends that the Human Rights Council consider requesting the 
mandate holder to monitor the adverse effects of hazardous products and wastes 
during the whole life cycle, from their production to their disposal. Accordingly, the 
new title of the mandate would be &#8220;Special Rapporteur on the adverse effects of the 
unsound management and disposal of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on 
human rights&#8221;. The expression &#8220;unsound management and disposal&#8221; is to be 
interpreted extensively, so as to encompass the whole life cycle of hazardous products 
and wastes (cradle-to-grave approach). 
</b>73. <b>The Special Rapporteur intended to complete his term by developing a set of 
guidelines on human rights-based approaches to the sound production, management 
and disposal of hazardous products and wastes. He discussed this issue informally 
with a number of delegations, some of which expressly supported the development of 
such guidelines during the interactive dialogue. Nevertheless, Human Rights Council 
resolution 12/18 only called for the organization of a panel discussion to inform the 
future work of the Special Rapporteur. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>Based on the impetus created by this debate, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that the Council request the new mandate holder to develop such 
guidelines, prior to the renewal of the mandate, due in September 2011. The 
guidelines should be developed in close consultation with relevant stakeholders, 
including States, relevant human rights bodies and mechanisms, United Nations 
specialized agencies, programmes and bodies, the secretariats of multilateral 
environmental treaties, national human rights institutions, NGOs and representatives 
of the private sector. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The present report identifies some issues that, although not new, would 
nevertheless continue to deserve the attention of the mandate in view of their scale, 
their potential or actual adverse impact on human rights and/or the lack of an 
adequate legal framework. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>With regard to the human rights impact of ship-breaking, the Special 
Rapporteur wishes to reiterate the recommendations addressed to States and other 
relevant stakeholders to consider adopting and implementing voluntary measures to 
address the negative impacts of ship-breaking that are not covered by the Hong Kong 
Convention on ship recycling (see A/HRC/12/26, paras. 64&#8211;65). He also encourages the 
new mandate holder to submit his/her preliminary assessment on whether the IMO 
Convention establishes a level of control and enforcement equivalent to that 
established under the Basel Convention to the secretariat of the Basel Convention, and 
to consider attending COP-10 in order to share with the parties to the Basel 
Convention the views expressed by the mandate with regard to the shortcomings of 
the Hong Kong Convention. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>In view of the gaps and ambiguities in the existing international legal 
framework on the sound production, management and disposal of e-waste, and taking 
into account the significant increase in the amount of e-waste generated worldwide, 
the Special Rapporteur encourages the new mandate holder to continue studying this 
phenomenon, with a view to making appropriate recommendations to the Human 
Rights Council on adequate measures to control the transfer of obsolete or broken </b></p>


<p><b>20</b> GE.10-14907 
</p>
<p><b>electrical and electronic products to countries that do not possess the capacity to 
dispose of them in an environmentally sound manner. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>As far as hazardous chemicals and pesticides are concerned, the Special 
Rapporteur encourages the new mandate holder to continue participating in 
international efforts aimed at achieving the sound management of chemicals at all 
stages of their life cycle. More specifically, he recommends that the new Special 
Rapporteur continue to work closely with the SAICM secretariat and the secretariats 
of the Stockholm and Rotterdam Conventions in order to advocate for the inclusion of 
a human rights-based approach in any initiative to promote chemicals safety. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The present report also drew the attention of the Human Rights Council to two 
emerging issues that in the view of the Special Rapporteur would need to be studied 
from a human rights perspective. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes the initiative undertaken by the UNEP 
Governing Council to develop a legally-binding instrument on mercury, and calls on 
States to support the adoption of such an instrument. He also encourages the new 
mandate holder to consider participating in the negotiating process, in order to ensure 
that a human rights-based approach to the sound management of mercury 
throughout its life cycle be included in the new instrument. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls on States, United Nations specialized agencies, 
programmes and bodies, the secretariats of multilateral environmental treaties, NGOs 
and representatives of the private sector to take all necessary steps to phase out the 
use of lead in lead-based paints. Such steps should include: the adoption of national 
legal frameworks to prohibit the use of lead in household paints; the development of 
prevention programmes to reduce exposure; allocation of adequate human, technical 
and financial resources to estimate the prevalence of lead in paints used at the 
national level and its adverse impact on the health of affected communities; and the 
organization of awareness-raising campaigns on the toxicity of lead-based paints. The 
Special Rapporteur also encourages the new mandate holder to assist the Council in 
clarifying the adverse impact that lead in paint can have on the enjoyment of human 
rights of affected individuals and communities. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The present report reviewed the current methods of work of the mandate 
holder in order to assess to what extent the structure of the mandate is appropriate to 
enable the Special Rapporteur to carry out the functions described in resolution 9/1. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The Special Rapporteur is of the view that it is useful to continue to devote 
annual reports to an in-depth analysis of selected thematic issues, chosen on the basis 
of the criteria identified in his preliminary report to the Commission 
(E/CN.4/2005/45). Nevertheless, he would encourage human rights treaty bodies, and 
in particular the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, to make better 
use of the extensive research carried out by the mandate holder, for example during 
the interactive dialogue with States parties. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>With regard to country visits, the Special Rapporteur regrets that while certain 
States have seriously engaged with the mandate, others have shown less commitment, 
as demonstrated by the limited number of visits that he has been able to undertake 
during his tenure. He therefore recommends that the Council reiterate its call on 
States to facilitate the work of the mandate holder by extending him/her an invitation 
to undertake country visits. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Special Rapporteur also recommends that the new mandate holder 
consider establishing a formal mechanism to follow up on country visits. He requests 
that treaty bodies and the Human Rights Council during the Universal Periodic </b></p>


<p>GE.10-14907 <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>Review pay more attention to the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur 
in mission reports, and encourages NGOs to provide information on the measures 
adopted by the State to implement these recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>As is the case for follow up to mission reports, the Special Rapporteur notes 
that the Human Rights Council and the treaty bodies have only paid limited attention 
to the information generated by the communication procedure. The Special 
Rapporteur believes that the review of the country situation during the Universal 
Periodic Review or in connection with the interactive dialogue with treaty bodies 
would offer a valuable opportunity to follow up on the effectiveness of the measures 
adopted by the country to eliminate the human rights violations addressed in the 
communication procedure. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Special Rapporteur considers that the collaboration with UNEP, relevant 
United Nations specialized agencies and the secretariats of environmental conventions 
is of vital importance for the mandate. He therefore encourages</b> <b>the new mandate 
holder to continue the established cooperation with the secretariats of environmental 
conventions, in particular the secretariat of the Basel Convention, and to seek ways to 
establish a closer and more coordinated collaboration with UNEP, ILO and WHO. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The Human Rights Council should consider transmitting thematic reports of 
the Special Rapporteur to the Governing Council of UNEP, and request that the latter 
extend an invitation to the Special Rapporteur to address its annual sessions. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>Finally, the Special Rapporteur believes that there is room for strengthened 
collaboration between the mandate and NGOs. He is aware that the mandate deals 
with borderline issues that neither human rights NGOs nor their environmental 
counterparts may be fully familiar with. In order to strengthen the links between the 
mandate and national and international NGOs working in the field of human rights, 
environmental protection and chemicals or waste management, the new Special 
Rapporteur should, in consultation with OHCHR, identify ways and strategies to 
make civil society organizations more familiar with the mandate in general, and more 
specifically with the individual communication procedure.</b>
