<p><b>Human Rights Council 
Twenty-first session 
</b></p>
<p>Agenda item 4 
<b>Human rights situations that require the Council</b>&#8217;<b>s attention 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Report of the independent international commission of 
inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic</b>* 
</p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The situation of human rights in the Syrian Arab Republic has deteriorated 
significantly since 15 February 2012. Armed violence increased in intensity and spread to 
new areas. Active hostilities raged between Government forces (and the <i>Shabbiha</i>) and 
anti-Government armed groups. Sporadic clashes between the armed actors evolved into 
continuous combat, involving more brutal tactics and new military capabilities on both 
sides. The level of armed violence varied throughout the country. 
</p>
<p> During the reporting period, the commission of inquiry determined that the intensity 
and duration of the conflict, combined with the increased organizational capabilities of anti-
Government armed groups, had met the legal threshold for a non-international armed 
conflict. The commission therefore applied both international humanitarian law and 
international human rights law in its assessment of the actions of the parties to the 
hostilities. 
</p>
<p> The commission found reasonable grounds to believe that Government forces and 
the <i>Shabbiha</i> had committed the crimes against humanity of murder and of torture, war 
crimes and gross violations of international human rights law and international 
humanitarian law, including unlawful killing, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, sexual 
violence, indiscriminate attack, pillaging and destruction of property. The commission 
found that Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> members were responsible for the killings in 
Al-Houla. 
</p>
<p> The commission confirms its previous finding that violations were committed 
pursuant to State policy. Large-scale operations conducted in different governorates, their 
similar modus operandi, their complexity and integrated military-security apparatus 
indicate the involvement at the highest levels of the armed and security forces and the 
Government. The <i>Shabbiha</i> were identified as perpetrators of many of the crimes described 
in the present report. Although the nature, composition and hierarchy of the <i>Shabbiha</i> 
</p>
<p>  
 * The annexes to the present report are reproduced as received, in the language of submission only. 
</p>

<p>remains unclear, credible information led to the conclusion that they acted in concert with 
Government forces. 
</p>
<p> The commission found reasonable grounds to believe that war crimes, including 
murder, extrajudicial execution and torture, had been perpetrated by organized anti-
Government armed groups. Although not a party to the Geneva Conventions, these groups 
must abide by the principles of international humanitarian law. The violations and abuses 
committed by anti-Government armed groups did not reach the gravity, frequency and scale 
of those committed by Government forces and the <i>Shabbiha</i>. 
</p>
<p> Both groups violated the rights of children. 
</p>
<p> The commission is unaware of efforts meeting international standards made by 
either the Government or anti-Government armed groups to prevent or punish the crimes 
documented in the present report. 
</p>
<p> The lack of access significantly hampered the commission&#8216;s ability to fulfil its 
mandate. Its access to Government officials and to members of the armed and security 
forces was negligible. Importantly, victims and witnesses inside the country could not be 
interviewed in person. 
</p>
<p> A confidential list of individuals and units believed to be responsible for crimes 
against humanity, breaches of international humanitarian law and gross human rights 
violations will be submitted to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights at 
the close of the commission&#8216;s current mandate, in September 2012. 
</p>
<p> The commission reiterates that the best solution is a negotiated settlement involving 
an inclusive and meaningful dialogue among all parties, leading to a political transition that 
reflects the legitimate aspirations of all segments of Syrian society, including ethnic and 
religious minorities.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 19/22 
of 23 March 2012, in which the Council extended the mandate of the independent 
international commission of inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic established by the 
Council in its resolution S-17/1 of 22 August 2011. 
</p>
<p>2. In the present report, the commission1 sets out its findings based on investigations 
conducted up until 20 July 2012. The report builds upon the commission&#8216;s periodic updates 
released on 16 April and 24 May 2012, as well as the oral update presented by the 
commission to the Human Rights Council on 27 June 2012 (A/HRC/20/CRP.1). It also 
updates the findings of the commission&#8216;s special inquiry into the events in Al-Houla, 
mandated by the Council in its resolution S-19/1 of 1 June 2012. 
</p>
<p>3. The present report should be read in conjunction with the commission&#8216;s previous 
reports (A/HRC/S-17/2/Add.1 and A/HRC/19/69) with regard to the interpretation of its 
mandate and working methods, as well as its factual and legal findings concerning the 
events in the Syrian Arab Republic between March 2011 and 15 February 2012. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Challenges 
</b></p>
<p>4. The commission faced a number of challenges. It was given a broad mandate &#8212; 
geographically, temporally and materially &#8212; to investigate all allegations of human rights 
violations committed in the country since March 2011. This meant conducting 
investigations in the context of a rapidly changing situation, which evolved into armed 
conflict. 
</p>
<p>5. Lack of physical access to the country also significantly hampered the commission&#8216;s 
ability to fulfil its mandate. In particular, its access to Government officials and to members 
of the armed and security forces was negligible. Importantly, victims and witnesses inside 
the country, especially those allegedly abused by anti-Government armed groups, could not 
be interviewed in person. 
</p>
<p>6. The commission filed repeated requests to visit the country, including through notes 
verbales and letters dated 2 and 16 April, 1, 10 and 29 May, and 22 June 2012 (annex I), 
and meetings with the Permanent Representative of the Syrian Arab Republic in Geneva on 
26 and 30 April and 18 and 21 June 2012. These efforts enabled the Chairperson to visit 
Damascus from 23 to 25 June to discuss with the authorities the commission&#8216;s work, 
including the Al-Houla investigation. Details of the visit were reported by the commission 
in its oral update (A/HRC/20/CRP.1). The Government has yet to allow for in situ 
investigation by the commission. 
</p>
<p>7. During the commission&#8216;s mandate, the Government shared a number of documents, 
including reports of investigations conducted by national authorities, as well as lists of 
casualties. Such information is reflected in the present report, where relevant. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>8. The commission sought to adapt its methodology in view of the above challenges. 
While continuing efforts to reflect violations and abuses of human rights, irrespective of the 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The Commissioners are Paulo Sergio Pinheiro (Chairperson) and Karen Koning AbuZayd. </p>


<p>alleged perpetrator, the commission focused on the most serious allegations. It was mindful 
of the protection of victims and witnesses, concerns that lie at the heart of the methodology 
of human rights investigations. 
</p>
<p>9. Owing to the lack of access to the Syrian Arab Republic, the commission continued 
to deploy to the region to collect first-hand accounts from those who had left the country. 
Starting on 15 February, the commission conducted 693 interviews in the field and from 
Geneva, including by Skype and telephone with victims and witnesses inside the country. 
This brought the total number of interviews conducted by the commission to 1,062 since its 
establishment in September 2011. 
</p>
<p>10. The commission also examined photographs, video recordings, satellite imagery and 
additional material, such as forensic and medical records. It continued to review reports 
from Government and non-governmental (both international and Syrian opposition) 
sources, academic analyses, media accounts (including Syrian news outlets), as well as 
United Nations reports, including from human rights bodies and mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>11. The commission applied the standard of proof used in previous reports, namely 
&#8213;reasonable grounds to believe&#8214;. The commission relied mainly on first-hand accounts to 
corroborate incidents. 
</p>
<p>12. In its previous reports, the commission did not apply international humanitarian law. 
During the present reporting period, the commission determined that the intensity and 
duration of the conflict, combined with the increased organizational capabilities of anti-
Government armed groups, had met the legal threshold for a non-international armed 
conflict. With this determination, the commission applied international humanitarian law in 
its assessment of the actions of the parties during hostilities (see also annex II). 
</p>
<p>13. The commission continued its engagement with representatives of Member States, 
United Nations bodies and other international and regional organizations. The commission 
is grateful to all those who cooperated with it in the fulfilment of its mandate, first and 
foremost the victims of and witnesses to human rights violations and abuses. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Context 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Political background 
</b></p>
<p>14. Efforts to find a solution to the crisis in the Syrian Arab Republic continued 
throughout the reporting period. The Government launched several political and 
governance reforms, while the United Nations and the League of Arab States appointed a 
joint special envoy, Kofi Annan, on 23 February 2012. These efforts brought little progress, 
given the escalating violence and the significant deterioration in the situation on the ground. 
</p>
<p>15. The reform initiatives included a referendum on a new Constitution, held on 26 
February 2012, parliamentary elections, held on 7 May, and the appointment of a new 
Government, on 23 June. These events were opportunities for introducing political 
pluralism and a democratic political process. They were not, however, viewed as inclusive 
enough to satisfy the growing dissident movement within the country or the exiled 
opposition. 
</p>
<p>16. President Bashar Al Assad did not succeed in engaging the opposition in a 
meaningful dialogue. The elections were boycotted by the opposition, and their outcome 
preserved the supremacy of the Baath party in Parliament as well as in the new 
Government, thus failing to bring emerging political forces into governance institutions. 
This development further antagonized segments of the population and opposition groups. </p>


<p>17. The efforts of the international community channelled through the joint special 
envoy resulted in the presentation of a six-point plan on 10 March 2012. The plan outlined 
steps to bring about a cessation of violence by all parties and a commitment to a political 
process. The ceasefire came into effect on 12 April, followed by the deployment by the 
Security Council of the United Nations Supervision Mission in the Syrian Arab Republic 
(UNSMIS) on 21 April for an initial period of 90 days to monitor the plan&#8216;s 
implementation. The arrival of UNSMIS observers had an initial positive impact on the 
ground, and levels of violence decreased in April. Thereafter, however, military operations 
intensified to such a level that, by 15 June, UNSMIS had to suspend its activities 
temporarily. On 20 July, the mandate of UNSMIS was extended for a final period of 30 
days. Further renewal was conditional on the cessation of the use of heavy weapons and a 
reduction in violence by all sides. 
</p>
<p>18. Opposition groups represented in the Syrian National Council refused to engage 
with President Assad, calling for him to leave power. Both the Syrian National Council and 
the Free Syrian Army (FSA) accepted the six-point plan, including the ceasefire. In March, 
an agreement was signed by the Council and the FSA to cooperate on channelling funds to 
the FSA via a liaison office within the Council; it was not implemented, however, and each 
group continued to operate independently. 
</p>
<p>19. Positions varied in the international community on how to deal with the conflict. 
Some States demanded the immediate departure of the President; others focused on 
preventing any form of outside intervention. Others continued to provide military supplies 
to the Government. Still others called for funding, and provided communication and 
material support to anti-Government armed groups. The alleged presence of foreign 
advisers was also a point of contention among States, as was the use of sanctions. The 
uncertain international context undermined the efforts of the joint special envoy to achieve 
a political solution to the conflict. 
</p>
<p>20. On 30 June 2012, the joint special envoy convened a meeting of an action group 
consisting of the United Nations, the League of Arab States and the European Union, as 
well as countries with an influence over the parties to the conflict, including the five 
Permanent Members of the Security Council. In a communiqu&#233;, the Action Group renewed 
a commitment to the six-point plan and set out principles and guidelines for a Syrian-led 
political transition. Opposition groups criticized the proposed transition for leaving the door 
open for President Assad to be part of a transitional Government. In a meeting held in Cairo 
on 2 and 3 July under the auspices of the League of Arab States, the Syrian opposition 
issued a common vision of a political transition and a national pact establishing justice, 
democracy and pluralism as the constitutional foundations of the future Syria. However, 
they were unable to agree on the election of a body that would represent them at the 
international level. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Military situation</b>2 
</p>
<p>21. During the reporting period, the security situation deteriorated significantly, with 
armed violence increasing in intensity and spreading to new areas. Active hostilities 
increased between Government forces (and pro-Government militia) and anti-Government 
armed groups. Sporadic clashes between the armed actors evolved into continuous combat, 
involving more brutal tactics and new military capabilities on both sides. Levels of armed 
violence varied throughout the country. 
</p>
<p>  
 2 See also annex III. </p>


<p>22. The Government increasingly deployed its troops and heavy equipment in 
operations against areas perceived to be supporting opposition groups. All army divisions 
and security services engaged in military operations. Typically, such operations began with 
the cordoning off of a targeted area with checkpoints, then shelling as a prelude to 
incursions by ground forces to dislodge insurgents and their supporters. Shelling was also 
used in the context of direct clashes and in operations to quell demonstrations. Air assets 
also fired on fighters and unarmed demonstrators in localities under the influence of armed 
groups. 
</p>
<p>23. Government forces directed their main efforts towards the control of major cities 
such as Damascus, Aleppo, Homs and Hama. Attacks on areas allegedly infiltrated by anti-
Government armed groups had the unintended effect of increasing the support of local 
populations for those groups. During many operations, large numbers of fighters and 
civilians were killed. 
</p>
<p>24. Pro-Government militia, including <i>Shabbiha</i>, reportedly acted alongside 
Government forces in security and military operations. Their precise nature, strength and 
relationship with the Government remains unclear. 
</p>
<p>25. The army faced increased attrition in personnel and equipment owing to combat 
operations, defections and casualties. Defections affected the troops psychologically, 
fuelling a crisis of confidence within the ranks and encouraging further defections. The 
Government also had difficulties in drafting new recruits, as many of those called up for 
mandatory military service refused to report. 
</p>
<p>26. Anti-Government armed groups expanded their activities throughout the country, 
clashing with Government forces on multiple fronts simultaneously. At the time of writing, 
they were involved in sustained armed confrontations inside the capital, while establishing 
sanctuaries throughout the rest of the country. Accounts indicated that there were foreign 
fighters in the ranks of some armed groups. 
</p>
<p>27. The FSA took measures to address the apparent deficiencies in its overall effective 
command structure. In some governorates, the FSA created local military councils that 
claimed leadership over groups fighting in those areas. Many groups claimed affiliation 
with the FSA, while other groups are emerging without a pronounced affiliation with it. 
</p>
<p>28. Anti-Government armed groups engaged with the Government forces through direct 
clashes, ambushes and raids. While investigations did not confirm the use of more 
sophisticated weaponry by anti-Government armed groups, their access to and capacity to 
effectively use available weapons improved. They appeared to have access to increased 
funding and logistical support. 
</p>
<p>29. The commission noted the increased and effective use of improvised explosive 
devices against the convoys, patrols and facilities of Government forces. They were also 
used to target members of military and security forces and Government officials. 
</p>
<p>30. Several radical Islamic armed groups have emerged in the country. The most 
important is the Al-Nusrah Front for the People of the Levant, a group allegedly linked with 
Al-Qaida, which claimed responsibility for several attacks, including suicide bombings 
against Government forces and senior officials. 
</p>
<p>31. There are also self-defence groups in several localities. Some of these groups 
emerged in villages populated by allegedly pro-Government minorities. </p>


<p><b> C. Socioeconomic and humanitarian situation 
</b></p>
<p>32. The crisis precipitated a rapid decline in the State&#8216;s economy. It has exacerbated pre-
existing levels of poverty and unemployment driven by a decade-long drought in rural 
agricultural areas, which led to the displacement of farmers to cities, and growing 
resentment against those who were, or appeared to be, enjoying the economic benefits 
distributed by the Government. According to the International Monetary Fund, the 
economy of the Syrian Arab Republic will contract significantly in 2012, primarily because 
of sanctions. The sharp drop in economic growth has been accompanied by alarming 
indicators, such as the devaluation of the Syrian pound, which has lost 30 per cent of its 
value since the onset of events, and inflation that soared to over 50 per cent.3 
</p>
<p>33. The militarization of the conflict deepened the humanitarian crisis. Thousands of 
Syrians have been internally displaced or have fled to neighboring countries. At the time of 
writing, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated that 1.5 
million people had been internally displaced. The Syrian population is increasingly turning 
to the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, the World Food Programme and other organizations for 
help.4 By July, there were 114,208 Syrians registered as refugees, receiving assistance in 
four neighbouring countries (42,682 in Turkey, 34,050 in Jordan, 29,986 in Lebanon and 
7,490 in Iraq).5 Refugees inside the Syrian Arab Republic, including some 500,000 
Palestinians and more than 103,000 registered Iraqi refugees,6 are also affected by the 
situation. UNCHR reported that more than 13,000 Iraqi refugees left the Syrian Arab 
Republic in the first half of 2012, most returning to Iraq.7 
</p>
<p>34. On 16 July, the commission received information from the Government of the 
Syrian Arab Republic stating that it had been subjected &#8213;to more than 60 packages of illegal 
unilateral coercive sanctions by the United States of America, the European Union, the 
League of Arab States, Turkey, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, Japan and others&#8214;. In the 
Government&#8216;s view, these sanctions, which target economic, financial and agricultural life 
in the country, amount to collective punishment against the Syrian people. The Government 
particularly deplored the sanctions imposed on the import of oil products, including 
domestic gas and fuel oil, which severely affected the livelihood of ordinary Syrians. The 
negative consequences of sanctions, including those on public and private banking systems, 
oil exports and the import of medical supplies, were also denounced. 
</p>
<p>35. Accounts from interviewees demonstrated that entire communities are suffering 
from a lack of food, fuel, water, electricity and medical supplies. Shortages are especially 
acute in areas such as Homs, Idlib, Dar&#8216;a and Hama. People forced by the hostilities to 
leave their homes are in urgent need of shelter. According to the Office for the 
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the number of people in urgent need of assistance 
has risen sharply, from an estimated 1 to 1.5 million people,8 and continues to rise steadily. 
</p>
<p>36. The fourth meeting of the Syrian Humanitarian Forum, held on 16 July 2012, 
concluded that the deteriorating humanitarian situation was a matter of grave concern to the

<p>international community. The security situation has hindered the capacity of aid workers to 
assist the population in need. The two humanitarian assistance appeals for refugees in 
neighboring countries and the internally displaced persons and others in need inside the 
Syrian Arab Republic are only funded to 20 per cent.9 
</p>
<p><b> III. Findings 
</b></p>
<p>37. While the commission focused on most serious violations of human rights, it wishes 
to note the overall deteriorating human rights situation. In addition to the right to life and 
the right to liberty and personal security, other fundamental human rights continue to be 
violated. Increased violence has further restricted the freedoms of expression, association 
and peaceful assembly, which had initially sparked the March 2011 uprising. The Syrian 
population is generally deprived of basic economic, social and cultural rights. As it noted in 
previous reports, the commission remains gravely concerned at the prevailing climate of 
impunity for violations of human rights law. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Casualties 
</b></p>
<p>38. Information provided by the Government indicates that, as at 9 July 2012, 7,928 
people, including Government forces and civilians, had been killed as a result of the unrest. 
</p>
<p>39. Other entities, in particular Syrian non-governmental organizations and opposition 
groups, including local coordinating committees, the Centre for Documentation of 
Violations in Syria, the Syrian Network for Human Rights and the Syrian Observatory for 
Human Rights, are also counting casualties by employing a variety of methods. The 
numbers they report range from 17,000 to 22,000. The commission was unable to confirm 
these figures. 
</p>
<p>40. The commission recorded numerous casualties resulting from incidents across the 
country. It reports the deaths only of those persons about which it has first-hand 
information through interviews conducted by its investigators. In the commission&#8216;s figures, 
no distinction is made between civilians and fighters. Injured persons are not included. The 
commission, through interviews of victims and witnesses of events from 15 February to 20 
July, confirmed 840 deaths. 
</p>
<p><b> B.  Special inquiry into Al-Houla 
</b></p>
<p>41. The commission delivered its preliminary findings (A/HRC/20/CRP.1) to the 
Human Rights Council on 27 June 2012, based on evidence gathered up until 22 June. In its 
report, the commission concluded that the Government was responsible for the deaths of 
civilians as a result of shelling the Al-Houla area and, particularly, Taldou village. It also 
found that the Government&#8216;s investigation fell short of international human rights 
standards. With regard to the deliberate killing of civilians, the commission was unable to 
determine the identity of the perpetrators. Nevertheless, it considered that forces loyal to the 
Government were likely to have been responsible for many of the deaths. 
</p>
<p>42.  Access to the country was not granted despite specific requests addressed to the 
Government in a note verbale dated 4 June 2012 (annex I) and in person by the chairperson

<p>during his visit to Damascus on 24 and 25 June. The Government has not delivered a final 
report on its own inquiry, nor has it indicated when the report might be forthcoming.  
</p>
<p>43.  The commission conducted eight additional interviews, including with six witnesses 
from the Taldou area, two of whom were survivors. It examined other materials, including 
video recordings and satellite imagery. It also reviewed analyses from other sources.  
</p>
<p>44.  Forty-seven interviews from various sources were considered by the commission. 
Interviews were consistent in their depiction of events and their description of the 
perpetrators as Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i>. Apart from the two witnesses in the 
Government report, no other account supported the Government&#8216;s version of events. The 
commission carefully reviewed the two witnesses&#8216; testimony as set out in that report, and 
judged their accounts as unreliable owing to a number of inconsistencies (see also annex 
IV). Accounts of other witnesses interviewed by different investigators remained 
consistent, including those collected from children, despite the fact that they were 
conducted over an extended period of time. 
</p>
<p>45.  In its oral update to the Human Rights Council, the commission determined that 
anti-Government armed groups, Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> could have had access to 
the two crime scenes: the first, the seven Abdulrazzak family homes on Saad Road (Tariq 
Al-Sad) and the second, the two Al-Sayed family homes on Main Street (Al-Shar&#8216;i Al-
Raisi), across from the National Hospital.10 The commission has since determined that the 
checkpoint at Al-Qaws, which is closest to the Al-Sayed house on Main Street, remained in 
Government control on the day of the incident. The front line between the opposition and 
Government forces was north of the checkpoint. The commission, therefore, concluded that 
it was highly unlikely that an anti-Government armed group would have had access to the 
Al-Sayed family house on the day of the killings. 
</p>
<p>46.  Regarding the Abdulrazzak site, where more than 60 people were killed, the 
commission considered that a large number of perpetrators would have been required to 
carry out the crime. The commission found, through satellite imagery and corroborated 
accounts, that the movement of vehicles or weapons, as well as the size of the group, would 
have been easily detectable by Government forces stationed at the Water Authority 
position. The commission therefore believes that access to the scene was not possible for 
any sizeable anti-Government armed group.  
</p>
<p>47.  The National Hospital had been occupied by the army for several months when the 
incidents took place. Although it was accessible by foot from both crime scenes, no one &#8212; 
whether injured or fleeing the crime scenes &#8212; sought refuge there for treatment or 
protection. As far as the commission could determine, all the injured and their relatives, as 
well as people from nearby houses, fled to opposition-controlled areas. None of the injured 
sought medical attention in the National Hospital. The Government report depicted the 
loyalties of the Al-Sayed family as pro-Government, but surviving family members fled to 
opposition-controlled areas of Taldou, choosing not to seek assistance from nearby 
Government forces.  
</p>
<p>48.  The commission remains of the view that the Government has failed in its legal 
obligation to investigate the murders in Al-Houla of 25 May 2012. 
</p>
<p>49.  On the basis of available evidence, the commission concluded that the elements of 
the war crime of murder have been met. The killing of multiple civilians, including women 
and children, was deliberate and connected to the ongoing armed conflict. There are 
</p>
<p>  
 10 See A/HRC/20/CRP.1, para. 44 and annex.  </p>


<p>reasonable grounds to believe that the perpetrators of the crime, at both the Abdulrazzak 
and Al-Sayed family locations, were Government forces and <i>Shabbiha </i>members. 
</p>
<p>50.  There are also reasonable grounds to believe that these acts were part of a series of 
attacks directed against civilians, and as such, formed part of the conclusion (see section C 
below) that crimes against humanity were perpetrated by the Government and <i>Shabbiha</i>. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Unlawful killing</b>11<b> 
</b></p>
<p>51.  Cases of attacks on civilians, murder and extrajudicial executions rose sharply 
during the reporting period. The commission conducted some 300 interviews as it 
investigated incidents alleging the unlawful killing of civilians and <i>hors de combat</i> fighters. 
The incidents that occurred in the contexts described below were corroborated by multiple 
accounts.12 While both parties to the conflict perpetrated unlawful killings, the gravity, 
frequency and scale of the violations committed by Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> was, 
according to information available, well in excess of those committed by anti-Government 
armed groups. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> 
</b></p>
<p>52.  Most unlawful killings occurred in the context of attacks against the strongholds of 
anti-Government armed groups. According to the most prominent pattern, attacks began 
with a blockade of the area and shelling,13 followed by an assault by ground forces, 
including special forces and <i>Shabbiha</i>. Snipers were used extensively.14 On securing the 
area, Government forces undertook house-to-house searches. Defectors, activists and 
fighting-age men were systematically sought out during these operations. Wounded or 
captured anti-Government fighters were executed. In some cases, family members of 
fighters, defectors and activists, as well as others who appeared to have been randomly 
selected, were also executed.  
</p>
<p>53.  This pattern was recorded in, inter alia, Tremseh, Al Qubeir, Al-Houla, Kili, Tal 
Rifat, Taftanaz, Sarmin, Ain Larouz, Atarib, Abdita, Homs and Al Qusayr. 
</p>
<p>54.  Excessive force continued to be used against demonstrators exercising their right to 
peaceful protest in Al Qamishli in March, and in Damascus, Aleppo and Jabal Al Zawiya in 
April. 
</p>
<p>55.  The commission finds that the cases of unlawful killing described in the present 
report provide reasonable grounds to believe that the Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> 
violated provisions of international human rights law protecting the right to life. 
Furthermore, many of the same killings met the elements of the war crime of murder under 
international criminal law.15 
</p>
<p>56.  Attacks were frequently directed against civilians and civilian objects. Although the 
Government&#8216;s stated aim was to attack &#8213;terrorists&#8214;, the attacks were directed at 
</p>
<p>  
 11 See also annex II, paras. 30&#8211;42. 
 12 For a full account of the unlawful killings investigated by the commission, see annex V. 
 13 For more information on shelling, see annex VI. 
 14 Snipers regularly accompanied forces during ground assaults and were responsible for a significant 
</p>
<p>number of civilian deaths. The commission recorded 35 instances of civilians shot by snipers. Dozens 
of interviewees described the detrimental psychological and social effects of the presence of snipers 
in their neighborhood. People feared leaving their houses and, when shelling started, feared staying at 
home. 
</p>
<p> 15 Rome statute, art. 8 (2) (c) (i) &#8211; 1. See also annex II, paras. 30&#8211;42.  </p>


<p>neighbourhoods, towns and regions with civilian populations (see annex VI). The 
commission therefore concludes that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the war 
crime of attacking civilians was perpetrated in many instances. 
</p>
<p>57.  There are also reasonable grounds to believe that the documented incidents 
constituted the crime against humanity of murder. In towns and villages where there was a 
pattern of blockade, shelling, ground assault and house-to-house searches, the conditions 
for a widespread or systematic attack against a predominately civilian population were met. 
The scale of the attacks, their repetitive nature, the level of excessive force consistently 
used, the indiscriminate nature of the shelling and the coordinated nature of the attacks led 
the commission to conclude that they had been conducted pursuant to State policy.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-Government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>58.  Despite its limited access to victims of anti-Government armed groups, the 
commission was able to document cases of killing by anti-Government fighters of captured 
Government soldiers, <i>Shabbiha</i> and informers who admitted taking part in military attacks 
(see annex V). While the human rights legal regime differs with regard to such non-State 
actors as anti-Government armed groups, international humanitarian law applies equally to 
all parties to a conflict.  
</p>
<p>59.  The commission considered corroborated evidence of killing <i>hors de combat</i> 
soldiers and <i>Shabbiha</i>. In Al Qusayr, Bab Amr, Qaldiya and elsewhere, the commission 
noted that persons captured by anti-Government armed groups on occasion faced a quasi-
judicial process prior to their execution. A consistent account of the trial process has not 
been forthcoming, nor has information on the extent of adherence to fair trial standards. 
Executing a prisoner without affording fundamental judicial guarantees is a war crime. 
</p>
<p>60.  The commission concluded that information on executions perpetrated by anti-
Government armed groups &#8212; with or without a &#8213;trial&#8214; &#8212; constituted reasonable grounds to 
believe that the war crimes of murder or of sentencing or execution without due process had 
been committed on several occasions. The commission was not able to corroborate alleged 
attacks directed against individual civilians not participating in hostilities or against a 
civilian population.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Unknown perpetrators 
</b></p>
<p>61. The commission found that scores of civilians had been killed in nine explosions 
between March and July by unknown perpetrators.16 The explosions appeared to have been 
caused by suicide bombers or by improvised explosive devices, including vehicle-borne 
ones. 
</p>
<p>62. While the above-mentioned acts may be linked to non-international armed conflict 
and thus assessed under international humanitarian law, lack of access to the crime scenes 
combined with an absence of information on the perpetrators hampered the commission&#8216;s 
ability to make such an assessment. These are nevertheless domestic crimes prosecutable 
under the Syrian criminal code. The Government is obliged to ensure that an investigation 
is conducted impartially, promptly, effectively and independently, in accordance with its 
international human rights obligations.  
</p>
<p>  
 16 See annex V, para. 55.  </p>


<p><b> D. Arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance</b>17<b> 
</b></p>
<p>63. The commission interviewed 25 people who alleged to have been arbitrarily arrested 
and unlawfully detained. A further five interviews were conducted with defectors claiming 
to have observed arbitrary arrests and detentions while in active service. 
</p>
<p>64. According to the Government, more than 10,000 people have been released since 
February 2011, pursuant to 4 amnesties, including 275 people released on 10 July 2012. In 
his report on the implementation of Security Council resolution 2043 (2012) (S/2012/523), 
the Secretary-General noted that UNSMIS had observed the release of 468 detainees in 
Dar&#8216;a, Damascus, Hama, Idlib and Deir el-Zour on 31 May and 14 June 2012.  
</p>
<p>65. Official statistics on the number of detainees and detention centres have yet to be 
provided by the Government. As at 25 June, UNSMIS had received and cross-checked 
information on 2,185 detainees and 97 places of detention across the country. Syrian non-
governmental organizations put the number of those currently detained as high as 26,000. 
The commission was unable to confirm the number of those arrested and detained. 
</p>
<p>66. Most arrests were made in four situations: those believed to be planning to defect or 
who had refused to follow orders (usually to open fire on civilians); during house searches; 
at checkpoints; and protesters, either at or subsequent to protests. In a few cases, people 
were arrested randomly in areas where there were no active hostilities. Four of those so 
reported were women. Two were children, a boy of 14 and a girl of 9. 
</p>
<p>67.  No interviewee was offered or received legal counsel. With one exception, no 
interviewee received a family visit. Only two interviewees, arrested on suspicion of 
planning to defect, were formally charged with an offence. 
</p>
<p>68. Many claimed that, prior to release, they were made to sign or thumbprint a 
document, the contents of which were unknown to them. Three detainees were brought 
before a judge and then released. In one unverified incident, the interviewee stated that, 
although the judge had ordered his release, he had remained in detention for another 3 
months. Also interviewed was a former judge who stated that security agents prohibited 
questioning unless they were present and, on one occasion, held the judge at gunpoint.  
</p>
<p>69. The duration of detention of interviewees ranged from a few hours to 5 months. 
Most of those interviewed were held for 60 days or fewer. 
</p>
<p>70.  The commission considers that domestic legislation in the Syrian Arab Republic 
(see annex II) fails to meet its obligations under article 9 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights to ensure that those arrested and detained on criminal charges 
appear &#8213;promptly before a judge or other officer authorized by law to exercise judicial 
power&#8214;. 
</p>
<p>71. There are reasonable grounds to believe that Government forces arbitrarily arrested 
and detained individuals. Of particular concern are the detention of individuals without 
charge, the failure to provide detainees with legal counsel or family visits and the absence 
in most cases of any form of judicial review.  
</p>
<p>72. Regarding enforced disappearance, families of those arrested were not informed at 
the time of arrest or at any point thereafter of the place of detention of their relatives. In 
most cases, families were unaware of their relatives&#8216; place of detention. 
</p>
<p>  
 17 See also annex VII.  </p>


<p>73.  Where the Government refuses to acknowledge the arrest and detention or to 
disclose the fate of the person concerned, the crime of enforced disappearance has been 
committed. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Torture and other forms of ill-treatment</b>18<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> 
</b></p>
<p>74. Starting on 15 February 2012, the commission interviewed 81 people regarding 
allegations of torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Fifty-nine 
interviews concerned events within the reporting period. The commission was unable to 
visit detention centres to interview detainees or to observe detention conditions. 
</p>
<p>75. Thirty of the above-mentioned 59 stated that they had been arrested and/or detained 
by Government forces or <i>Shabbiha</i>. All but one reported suffering physical violence during 
detention. Nineteen other interviewees reported witnessing detainees being tortured or ill-
treated; this included 10 individuals who had worked in detention centres or at checkpoints 
before defecting. Where possible, the commission observed the wounds or scars of alleged 
victims. 
</p>
<p>76. While most had been held in official detention centres, six stated that they had been 
detained in unofficial facilities, such as civilian houses, prior to being transferred to an 
official centre. In unofficial centres, interviewees reported abuse by soldiers and <i>Shabbiha</i>. 
A further nine interviewees stated that they had been beaten or assaulted during house 
searches or at checkpoints, or had witnessed the assault of others. None of the nine was 
subsequently detained.  
</p>
<p>77. Reported methods of torture were consistent across the country. Interviewees 
described being severely beaten about the head and body with electric cables, whips, metal 
and wooden sticks and rifle butts, burned with cigarettes, kicked, or subjected to electric 
shocks applied to sensitive parts of the body, including the genitals. Six interviewees 
reported having lost consciousness during interrogation. 
</p>
<p>78. Multiple reports were received about detainees being beaten on the soles of the feet 
(<i>falaqa</i>). Common practices included keeping detainees in prolonged stress positions, 
including hanging from walls or ceilings by their wrists (<i>shabeh</i>) or hanging by their wrists 
tied behind their backs. Other methods comprised forcing detainees to bend over and put 
their head, neck and legs through a tyre while beatings were administered (<i>dulab</i>); and 
tying detainees to a board with their head unsupported and either stretching them or folding 
the board in half. Some detainees were subjected to rape and other forms of sexual 
violence.19 On many interviewees, scars and wounds consistent with their accounts were 
visible.  
</p>
<p>79. Several forms of torture and ill-treatment meted out did not result in physical 
evidence. Detainees were forcibly shaved, made to imitate dogs and declare that &#8213;there is 
no God but Bashar&#8214;. Other interviewees stated that they were forced to undress and remain 
naked for prolonged periods. Three interviewees stated that they were threatened with 
execution. One reported being present when another detainee was threatened with sexual 
assault; another stated that interrogators threatened to arrest and rape female relatives. 
</p>
<p>80. Six interviewees were moved to multiple detention facilities, among different 
intelligence agencies. One interviewee reported having been moved to 10 different centres 
</p>
<p>  
 18 See also annex VIII.  
 19 See also annex IX.  </p>


<p>across four governorates in five months. Another interviewee was transferred to four 
different locations in Dar&#8216;a and Damascus, again during five months. Where there were 
multiple transfers, interviewees suffered physical violence in each location. 
</p>
<p>81. The majority of detainees described being held in small, overcrowded cells. Two 
interviewees reported that cells were so overcrowded that it was impossible to sit or lie 
down. All but one reported that food and water were inadequate. One interviewee stated 
that, having been without water for a week, he had to drink his own urine. Several 
interviewees stated that their cells had no toilet. Four interviewees described cells infested 
with insects and lice. The commission was unable to corroborate reports of the denial of 
medication and medical treatment.  
</p>
<p>82. The commission recorded accounts that, if verified, would amount to a breach of the 
Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (see annex II).  
</p>
<p>83. The commission confirms its previous finding that torture and other forms of cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment were committed by Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i>, in 
violation of the State&#8216;s obligations under international humanitarian law and international 
human rights law.  
</p>
<p>84. The commission determined that severe pain was inflicted upon persons in official 
and unofficial detention centres, during house searches and at checkpoints. It also found 
that torture was inflicted to punish, to humiliate or to extract information. Much of the 
physical violence described by interviewees has been found to constitute torture by various 
international tribunals (see annex II).  
</p>
<p>85. The commission found reasonable grounds to believe that torture was perpetrated as 
part of a widespread attack directed against civilians by Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> 
who had knowledge of the attack. It concludes that torture as a crime against humanity and 
as a war crime was committed by Government forces and <i>Shabbiha </i>members. Members of 
security forces, in particular military and air force intelligence, appear to be primarily 
responsible for torture and ill-treatment. The commission noted the involvement of 
<i>Shabbiha</i> members in acts of torture in unofficial detention centres in Homs in February 
and March. 
</p>
<p>86. The commission found that conduct such as forcibly shaving detainees and forcing 
them to imitate dogs constitutes cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Similarly, the 
conditions of detention as described in interviews constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment of detainees. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-Government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>87. Fifteen interviews were conducted about the treatment of members of Government 
forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> members by anti-Government armed groups. All interviewees claimed 
to be members of these armed groups and detailed the capture, interrogation and either 
release or execution of those detained. Three interviewees stated that captured Government 
fighters and <i>Shabbiha</i> members were tortured during interrogation prior to execution. 
</p>
<p>88. The commission found reasonable grounds to believe that torture and other forms of 
ill-treatment were committed by anti-Government armed groups during interrogation of 
captured members of Government forces and the <i>Shabbiha</i>. It determines that severe pain 
was inflicted to punish, to humiliate or to extract information.  
</p>
<p>89. The commission determines, however, that the acts of torture were not committed as 
part of either a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population; therefore, they do 
not constitute crimes against humanity, but may be prosecutable as war crimes. </p>


<p><b> F. Indiscriminate attacks 
</b></p>
<p>90. To comply with international humanitarian law, those ordering and carrying out 
attacks must ensure that they distinguish between civilian and military targets.20 Accounts 
indicated that Government forces on occasion directed shelling to target small opposition 
strongholds. In many attacks, however, those firing projectiles did not distinguish between 
civilian and military targets. In most of the cases investigated, shelling preceded an assault 
by ground forces; it was also used against demonstrations. In some cases, it was used 
against anti-Government armed groups where the military was unwilling to risk equipment 
and troops.  
</p>
<p>91. Most deaths in Bab Amr during the military operation that began in February 2012 
were caused by extensive and indiscriminate shelling by Government forces of primarily 
civilian infrastructure and residential areas. The city of Al Qusayr suffered indiscriminate 
attacks between February and May; one credible source told the commission, &#8213;I witnessed 
what people call indiscriminate shelling &#8211; the Syrian army just spreads mortar fire across an 
entire neighbourhood<i>.</i>&#8214; On 5 June, Government forces began an assault on Al Haffe by 
cordoning off the town and then shelling with tanks, mortars and helicopter gunships.  
</p>
<p>92. Additional corroborated accounts of indiscriminate shelling were recorded in Atarib, 
on 14 February; Ain Larouz, on 5 March; Sermin, on 22 March; Taftanaz, on 4 April; Kili, 
on 6 April; Al-Houla, on 25 May, and 12 and 13 June; Akko, on 9 June; Salma, on 11 June; 
and Jobar, on various dates in late June.  
</p>
<p>93. The commission took note of video evidence from Hama governorate in July 
indicating the use of cluster munitions. The material could not be corroborated. Although 
the Syrian Arab Republic is not a party to the Convention on Cluster Munitions, the 
commission notes that such weapons are inherently indiscriminate when employed in 
residential areas or areas frequented by civilians.  
</p>
<p>94. On the basis of its findings, the commission determined that the legal threshold for 
an indiscriminate attack as a violation of customary international humanitarian law was 
reached. Government forces fired shells into areas inhabited by civilians while failing to 
direct them at a specific military objective.  
</p>
<p>95. Moreover, the attacks, especially shelling, caused incidental loss of civilian life and 
injury to civilians, as well as damage to civilian objects. There are reasonable grounds to 
believe that the damage was excessive when compared to the anticipated military 
advantage. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Sexual violence</b>21<b> 
</b></p>
<p>96. Forty-three interviews were conducted on incidents of sexual violence, against men, 
women and children, committed by Government forces and the <i>Shabbiha</i> since February 
2012. Interviewees included two female and three male victims of rape. Also interviewed 
were five eyewitnesses of rape, three of whom were also victims. Seven interviewees were 
defectors who stated that rape and sexual assault had been committed by soldiers and the 
<i>Shabbiha</i>.  
</p>
<p>97. There were difficulties in collecting evidence of sexual violence owing to cultural, 
social and religious beliefs surrounding marriage and sexuality. 
</p>
<p>  
 20 See annex II, paras. 30&#8211;42.  
 21 See also annex IX.  </p>


<p>98. Accounts indicated that rape and other forms of sexual violence had been committed 
in two circumstances. The first was during house searches and at checkpoints by 
Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i>; the second, in detention. In addition, in Homs, between 
late February and April, there were several reports of abduction and rape of women, and 
corroborated accounts of women forced to walk naked in the streets of Karm-Al Zeitoun in 
February.  
</p>
<p>99. Fifteen interviewees described incidents of sexual violence committed during house 
searches and at checkpoints during military operations in Homs between February and 
May, and in Al Haffe in June. Five interviewees detailed incidents of sexual violence in 
Zabadani in late February and in various locations in Hama governorate in April. The 
attacks were reportedly perpetrated by soldiers and <i>Shabbiha</i>. 
</p>
<p>100. The commission continued to receive reports of rape and sexual assault in detention 
centres, committed usually as part of torture and/or ill-treatment. Multiple reports were 
received of male detainees receiving electric shocks to their genitals during interrogations. 
</p>
<p>101. The commission finds reasonable grounds to believe rape and sexual assault were 
perpetrated against men, women and children by Government forces and <i>Shabbiha 
</i>members. Rape and sexual assault were also part of torture in official and unofficial 
detention centres. 
</p>
<p>102. Having previously determined that military operations such as those in Homs in 
February and March and in Al Haffe in June were part of a widespread or systematic attack 
against a civilian population, the commission finds that the rapes committed during these 
attacks, made with knowledge of the attacks, could be prosecuted as crimes against 
humanity. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Violations of children</b>&#8217;<b>s rights</b>22 <b> 
</b></p>
<p>103. The commission conducted 168 interviews concerning alleged violations of 
children&#8216;s rights. Of these, 30 interviewees were under the age of 18. In interviews, the 
adverse psychological and social impact of the violence on children was evident.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> 
</b></p>
<p>104. The commission recorded the killing of 125 children, mainly boys, after 15 February 
</p><p>2012.  
</p>
<p>105. Children were killed and injured during the shelling of towns and villages. During a 
visit to a hospital in Turkey, the commission saw a 2-year-old girl, severely injured in the 
June shelling of Azaz. There were also multiple reports of children killed and wounded by 
snipers. 
</p>
<p>106. Children were also killed during attacks on protests, such as the attack in Menaq 
village on 15 March, and in attacks on villages believed to be harbouring defectors or anti-
Government armed groups. There were multiple accounts of children killed during military 
ground operations and house searches (see annex V). Forty-one children were among those 
killed in Al-Houla on 25 May. Some were killed during shelling, but most appeared to have 
been shot at close range.  
</p>
<p>107. There were reports of the arbitrary arrest and detention of children. Children 
described having been beaten, whipped with electrical cables, burned with cigarettes and 
</p>
<p>  
 22 See also annex X.  </p>


<p>subjected to electrical shocks to the genitals. There were multiple reports of detained 
minors held in the same cells as adults. 
</p>
<p>108. The commission received reports of the rape and sexual assault of girls under the 
age of 18 (see annex VII).  
</p>
<p>109. No evidence of Government forces formally conscripting or enlisting children under 
the age of 18 was received. However, three incidents were documented in which 
Government forces used children as hostages or as human shields.  
</p>
<p>110. Schools in various locations across the Syrian Arab Republic were looted, 
vandalized and burned in response to student protests. Various accounts described their use 
by Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> members as military staging grounds, temporary bases 
and sniper posts (see paragraphs 116&#8211;125 below). 
</p>
<p>111. Reports also indicated that injured people, including children, feared to seek medical 
treatment at public hospitals. Many children were brought to field clinics that could treat 
only minor injuries.  
</p>
<p>112. Evidence gathered indicated that children&#8216;s rights continue to be violated by 
Government forces and the <i>Shabbiha</i>. The legal conclusions reached in annexes IV, V, VII, 
VIII and IX apply.  
</p>
<p>113. The detention of adults and children together is in breach of the Government&#8216;s 
obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, unless a separation breaches 
the right of families to be housed together. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-Government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>114. Eleven interviewees, including four minors, discussed the use of children by anti-
Government armed groups. All stated that anti-Government armed groups, including the 
FSA, used children in support roles, such as assisting medical evacuations or as couriers. 
Five interviewees stated that the anti-Government armed groups used children under the 
age of 18 &#8212; and in one account, under 15 &#8212; as fighters. 
</p>
<p>115. The commission considers that there is currently insufficient information to find that 
anti-Government armed groups used children under the age of 15 to participate actively in 
hostilities. It notes with concern, however, the reports that children under 18 are fighting 
and performing auxiliary roles for anti-Government armed groups. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Attacks on protected persons and objects 
</b></p>
<p>116. The conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic has generated thousands of casualties. 
Hospitals and clinics have been caught up in hostilities. Field clinics have been deliberately 
targeted. Civilian objects, such as schools, municipal buildings and hospitals, are routinely 
occupied by Government forces seeking to establish a presence. Underground field clinics 
are poorly equipped, unsterile and lack basic tools, medical supplies and blood. The Syrian 
Arab Red Crescent is also active in providing for the medical and humanitarian needs of the 
conflict-affected. 
</p>
<p>117. International humanitarian law not only prohibits attacks on civilians and civilian 
objects but also requires their protection.23 The commission collected video materials and 
</p>
<p>  
 23 This protection remains in place unless the protected persons or objects take part in hostile acts. See 
</p>
<p>annex II, paras. 30&#8211;42. </p>


<p>conducted 12 interviews about attacks on protected persons or objects, in particular schools 
and medical facilities. 
</p>
<p>118. The commission recorded multiple incidents of attacks on field hospitals. During an 
intense shelling period, the Bab Amr field hospital was hit and partially destroyed. In Al 
Qusayr, in late February, a field clinic was attacked by a helicopter. One witness stated that, 
in February, the Yousef al-Atmeh school building in Jisr Al Shughour, used as a field clinic 
by local residents, was bombed by security forces. 
</p>
<p>119. Members of the Syrian Arab Red Crescent were victims of attacks. Five staff 
members have been killed since the beginning of the crisis, the latest on 10 July in Deir el-
Zour. In May, while evacuating two injured persons in A&#8216;zaz, a Red Crescent ambulance 
was shot at by military snipers and two medics were injured; all of them were wearing Red 
Crescent uniforms. On the same day, the Red Crescent office in A&#8216;zaz was shelled and 
burned. The director was arrested and held for 20 days. 
</p>
<p>120. On 24 April, in Duma, five ambulances belonging to the Syrian Arab Red Crescent 
were caught in crossfire. One doctor was killed and four Red Crescent staff members were 
injured. 
</p>
<p>121. Government forces continued to occupy public hospitals in several localities. In 
May, the military placed tanks, armed vehicles and troops inside the compound and snipers 
on the roof of the national hospital in A&#8216;zaz and Al Qusayr. The same occurred in Al Haffe 
in June. 
</p>
<p>122. Government forces occupied schools and other civilian buildings, transforming them 
into military staging grounds, temporary bases and sniper posts. For instance, in March, a 
girl from Atarib described the use of two schools as barracks for Government forces, with 
tanks at the school gates and snipers posted on the rooftops. The school in Al Qusayr was 
similarly occupied in May. One interviewee stated that, on 11 March, he was shot at by a 
sniper from the rooftop of the local school in Jondia. 
</p>
<p>123. The commission finds reasonable grounds to believe that Government forces acted 
in violation of international humanitarian law by targeting members of the Syrian Arab Red 
Crescent. These acts may also be prosecutable as a war crime. Furthermore, by positioning 
its military assets, which are legitimate targets of enemy forces, inside civilian objects, 
Government forces are violating the international humanitarian law principle of distinction. 
Government forces have also violated international humanitarian law by deliberately 
shelling field clinics. 
</p>
<p>124. The Government&#8216;s occupation of hospitals and schools infringes the rights to 
education and health. 
</p>
<p>125. The commission was unable to corroborate allegations of anti-Government groups 
targeting civilians or civilian objects. 
</p>
<p><b> J. Pillaging and destruction of property</b>24<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> 
</b></p>
<p>126. The commission received corroborated reports of the pillaging, destruction and 
burning of property by Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> members during its military 
operations. Where such acts occurred during house searches, the commission documented 
</p>
<p>  
 24 See also annex XI. </p>


<p>dozens of cases of looting of property, including of money, vehicles, jewellery and 
electrical goods. 
</p>
<p>127. Those interviewed indicated that searches, and thus the pillaging, burning and 
destruction of property, targeted groups and individuals who appeared to be defectors, 
members of anti-Government armed groups, demonstrators, and family members of the 
aforementioned. In particular, family members of defectors described how their homes, 
farms and shops were burned. In some instances, the looting, burning and destruction of 
property appeared to be directed at entire communities rather than at specific individuals. 
</p>
<p>128. According to soldiers who later defected, the looting and burning of property of 
opposition activists and defectors was intended to, inter alia, impose financial constraints 
on them and their activities. Government soldiers and <i>Shabbiha</i> also benefited from these 
acts financially, conducting them with complete impunity. 
</p>
<p>129. There are reasonable grounds to believe that Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> 
members committed the war crime of pillage. The commission also determined that 
Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> members engaged in the destruction and burning of 
property during house searches. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-Government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>130. The commission received no reports of the pillaging or destruction of property by 
anti-Government armed groups, but lack of access to Syrian Arab Republic hampered 
investigations. The Government provided information relating to crimes allegedly 
perpetrated by anti-Government armed groups, including looting and vehicle theft, which 
the commission was unable to corroborate. Consequently, the commission was unable to 
reach any findings regarding the alleged pillaging, burning and destruction of property by 
anti-Government armed groups. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Responsibility 
</b></p>
<p>131. The commission finds reasonable grounds to believe that crimes against humanity, 
breaches of international humanitarian law and gross human rights violations have been 
committed in the Syrian Arab Republic. The commission endeavoured, where possible, to 
identify individuals in leadership positions who may be responsible. In March, the 
commission handed over to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
confidential lists of suspected individuals and units.25 Further lists will be provided at the 
close of its current mandate, in September 2012. 
</p>
<p><b> A. State responsibility 
</b></p>
<p>132. The evidence collected confirmed the commission&#8216;s previous finding that violations 
had been committed pursuant to State policy. Large-scale operations conducted in different 
governorates, their similar modus operandi, their complexity and integrated 
military/security apparatus indicate involvement at the highest levels of the armed and 
security forces and the Government. 
</p>
<p>133. Eyewitnesses consistently identified the <i>Shabbiha</i> as perpetrators of many of the 
crimes described in the present report. Although the nature, composition, hierarchy and 
structure of this group remains opaque, credible information led to the conclusion that 
</p>
<p>  
 25 A/HRC/19/69, para. 87. </p>


<p><i>Shabbiha</i> members acted with the acquiescence of, in concert with or at the behest of 
Government forces. International human rights law recognizes the responsibility of States 
that commit violations through proxies. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Responsibility of anti-Government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>134. Although not a State party to the Geneva Conventions, organized armed groups 
must nevertheless abide by the principles of international humanitarian law.26 During non-
international armed conflicts, serious violations of international humanitarian law 
committed by members of such groups are prosecutable as war crimes. Non-State actors 
may also bear responsibility for gross abuses of human rights, in particular those that 
amount to international crimes.27 The commission identified such violations, including 
murder, extrajudicial execution and torture, perpetrated by members of anti-Government 
groups. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Individual responsibility 
</b></p>
<p>135. Whether members of Government forces or anti-Government groups, those who 
intentionally commit the crimes identified in the present report bear responsibility. In 
addition, those who order these crimes to be committed (or plan, instigate, incite, aid or 
abet) are also liable. The commission received consistent evidence that mid- and high-
ranking members of Government forces were directly involved in illegal acts. Defectors 
stated that commanders ordered their subordinates to shoot civilians and <i>hors de combat</i> 
fighters, and to torture and mistreat detainees. Orders were often enforced at gunpoint, and 
anyone hesitating to comply risked arrest or summary execution. Evidence showed that 
widespread looting and destruction of property occurred with the acquiescence of 
commanders. 
</p>
<p>136. Leadership within anti-Government armed groups was also implicated in the war 
crimes and human rights abuses detailed in the present report. Local commanders either 
ordered the execution of captured members of Government forces and the <i>Shabbiha</i> or 
killed them themselves. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Command responsibility 
</b></p>
<p>137. Military commanders and civilian superiors bear responsibility for crimes against 
humanity and war crimes if they fail to take reasonable measures within their power to 
prevent or repress the commission of these crimes or to submit the matter to the competent 
authorities. These measures must be implemented with respect to subordinates over whom 
they exercise effective command and control. 
</p>
<p>138. Extensive coverage of events, including the likely occurrence of violations and 
crimes, led the commission to conclude that military commanders and civilian superiors at 
the highest levels of Government must have known about such events. 
</p>
<p>139. The same applied to abuses and crimes committed by anti-Government armed 
groups. Local-level commanders acknowledged some of the acts described in interviews. 
</p>
<p>  
 26 See annex II, paras. 11&#8211;13. 
 27 See annex II, paras. 8&#8211;10. </p>


<p>140. The commission is unaware of efforts that meet international standards made by 
either the Government or anti-Government armed groups to prevent or punish crimes 
documented in the present report. 
</p>
<p>141. The Government&#8216;s National Independent Legal Commission has reportedly been 
investigating some allegations of violations.28 The Government also set up a special inquiry 
into the events of Al-Houla. The investigation reports received on Tremseh, Al Qubeir and 
Al-Houla were considered by the commission. The commission was unable to identify any 
case of successful prosecution of any military or security force commanders or civilian 
superiors who bore responsibility for crimes against humanity, war crimes or gross human 
rights violations committed since March 2011. 
</p>
<p>142. No credible information has been received about anti-Government armed groups 
investigating, prosecuting and punishing members of their groups alleged to have 
committed crimes and abuses identified. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>143. <b>The human rights crisis has escalated significantly in the context of 
unrestrained hostilities, which have evolved into a non-international armed conflict. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The civilian population across all communities bears the brunt of this conflict, 
</b></p>
<p><b>thousands having lost their lives in the spiral of violence.</b> 
</p>
<p>144. <b>The socioeconomic and humanitarian situation has further deteriorated, 
leaving the majority of the population in a state of disarray. The commission 
</b></p>
<p><b>maintains that sanctions result in a denial of the most basic human rights of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Syrian people.</b> 
</p>
<p>145. <b>The commission concludes that there are reasonable grounds to believe that 
Government forces and the <i>Shabbiha</i> committed crimes against humanity, war crimes 
</b></p>
<p><b>and violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law. 
</b></p>
<p><b>There are also reasonable grounds to believe that anti-Government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><b>committed war crimes and abuses of international human rights law and international 
</b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian law. Both parties violated the rights of children.</b> 
</p>
<p>146. <b>Human rights violations and abuses must be thoroughly investigated. Evidence 
of violations and abuses, including international crimes, must be systematically 
</b></p>
<p><b>collected to facilitate the process of holding perpetrators accountable. Access must be 
</b></p>
<p><b>accorded to the commission so that it may investigate such violations impartially and 
</b></p>
<p><b>in situ.</b> 
</p>
<p>147. <b>The commission believes that the large-scale operations during which the most 
serious violations were committed were conducted with the knowledge, or at the 
</b></p>
<p><b>behest, of the highest levels of Government. Responsibility therefore rests with those 
</b></p>
<p><b>who either ordered or planned the acts or, in the case of those in effective command 
</b></p>
<p><b>and control, those who failed to prevent or punish the perpetrators. The consistent 
</b></p>
<p><b>identification of the <i>Shabbiha</i> as perpetrators of many of the crimes does not relieve 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Government of its responsibility, as international law recognizes the responsibility 
</b></p>
<p><b>of States that commit violations through proxies.</b> 
</p>
<p>  
 28 On 25 June, the commission chairperson met the head of the National Independent Legal Commission 
</p>
<p>in Damascus. The Commission is represented in the capital and governorates. It reportedly received 
6,500 complaints, most of which refer to deaths and missing persons, levelled against the army, police 
and anti-Government armed groups. </p>


<p>148. <b>The commission identified violations of international humanitarian law and 
international human rights law committed by members of anti-Government groups. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Those who either ordered or planned the acts, or in the case of those in effective 
</b></p>
<p><b>command and control, failed to prevent or punish perpetrators, bear responsibility.</b> 
</p>
<p>149. <b>The increased militarization of the conflict is disastrous for the Syrian people 
and could provoke tragic consequences for the entire region. A sustained cessation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>hostilities by all parties remains of paramount importance to end the violence and 
</b></p>
<p><b>gross human rights violations and abuses.</b> 
</p>
<p>150. <b>The commission reiterates that the best solution continues to be a negotiated 
settlement involving an inclusive and meaningful dialogue among all parties, leading 
</b></p>
<p><b>to a political transition that reflects the legitimate aspirations of all segments of Syrian 
</b></p>
<p><b>society, including ethnic and religious minorities.</b> 
</p>
<p>151. <b>Considering the catastrophic threats to the Syrian polity and people, as well as 
to the stability of the region, the commission renews the recommendations made in its 
</b></p>
<p><b>previous reports, and emphasizes those that follow. 
</b></p>
<p>152. <b>With regard to the international community: 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a) Countries with influence over the parties to the Syrian conflict, in 
particular the permanent members of the Security Council, should work in concert to 
</b></p>
<p><b>put pressure on the parties to end the violence and to initiate all-inclusive negotiations 
</b></p>
<p><b>for a sustainable political transition process in the country</b>; 
</p>
<p> <b>(b) The continued presence of the United Nations in the country is essential 
for the effective implementation of the ceasefire and to support the Syrian people in 
</b></p>
<p><b>initiating broad, inclusive and credible consultations to achieve reconciliation, 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountability and reparation within the framework of international law.</b> 
</p>
<p>153. <b>The commission recommends that the Government of the Syrian Arab 
Republic</b>: 
</p>
<p> <b>(a) Investigate all violations of international human rights law and 
international humanitarian law as set out in the present report to ensure that those 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsible are held to account, in accordance with due process, and that victims are 
</b></p>
<p><b>afforded access to justice and reparation;</b> 
</p>
<p> <b>(b) Release immediately all persons arbitrarily detained, publish a list of all 
detention facilities and ensure that conditions of detention comply with applicable 
</b></p>
<p><b>law; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(c) Abide by the rules of armed conflict and distribute the rules of 
engagement guiding army and security forces operations; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(d) Grant the international community immediate access to the affected 
areas to provide humanitarian assistance to all those in need. 
</b></p>
<p>154. <b>The commission recommends that anti-Government armed groups:</b> 
</p>
<p> <b>(a) Adopt, publicly announce and abide by rules of conduct that are in line 
with international human rights law and international humanitarian law standards, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and hold perpetrators of abuses to account; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(b) Provide relevant humanitarian and human rights institutions with 
information on the fate of persons captured, and to give access to detainees. 
</b></p>
<p>155. <b>The commission recommends that the Office of the High Commissioner 
consolidate a presence in the region to strengthen efforts to promote and protect 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights in the Syrian Arab Republic. </b></p>


<p>156. <b>The commission recommends that the Human Rights Council transmit the 
present report to the Secretary-General for the attention of the Security Council so 
</b></p>
<p><b>that appropriate action may be taken in view of the gravity of the violations, abuses 
</b></p>
<p><b>and crimes perpetrated by Government forces and the <i>Shabbiha</i>, and by anti-

<p><b>Annex II 
</b></p>
<p>[<i>English only</i>] 
</p>
<p><b>  Applicable law  
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Background 
</b></p>
<p>1. Whether during peacetime or periods of armed conflict, a substantial body of 
international law will be in operation. The sources comprise primarily treaties ratified by 
the country in question. Customary international law (CIL) is also applicable. In its first 
report submitted in November 2011, the Commission identified the Syrian Arab Republic&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>legal obligations under international human rights law (IHRL).1 At that time, although 
violent clashes were occurring, the Syrian Arab Republic was in a state of peace and has 
not sought to derogate from any applicable treaty provisions.  
</p>
<p>2. In its second report submitted in February 2012, the commission expressed its 
concern that the violence in the Syrian Arab Republic had reached the requisite level of 
intensity to trigger the applicability of International Humanitarian Law (IHL). However, 
because it could not verify whether the FSA, or its associated groups, had reached the 
necessary level of organization, the commission determined that it could not apply IHL.  
</p>
<p>3. During the period covered by this third report, the commission has determined that 
the intensity and duration of the conflict, combined with the increased organizational 
capabilities of the FSA,2 do, in fact, meet the legal threshold for a non-international armed 
conflict.3 With this determination, the commission applied IHL, including Common Article 
3, in its assessment of the actions of the parties during hostilities.  
</p>
<p>4. As described below, egregious violations of human rights, customary or 
humanitarian law can give rise to individual criminal responsibility under international 
criminal law (ICL). 
</p>
<p><b> II. Regimes in effect 
</b></p>
<p>5. The onset of IHL applicability does not replace existing obligations under IHRL; 
both regimes remain in force and are generally considered as complementary and mutually 
reinforcing. Where both IHL and IHRL apply, and can be applied consistently, parties to a 
conflict are obliged to do so. In situations where IHL and IHRL are both applicable, but 
cannot be applied consistently, the principle of <i>lex</i> <i>specialis</i> applies.4 
</p>

 2 See annex III. 
 3 This view is supported by the ICRC, among others. See &#8213;the Syrian Arab Republic in civil war, Red 
</p>
<p>Cross says,&#8214; 15 July 2012, Available from http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18849362. 
President Assad himself described the Syrian Arab Republic as being in a state of war in a statement 
on 26 June 2012, see &#8213;the Syrian Arab Republic in a State of War, says Bashar al-Assad,&#8214; 26 July 
</p><p>2012. Available from http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18598533. 
</p>
<p> 4 See <i>Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons</i>, <i>Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1996</i>. The 
International Court of Justice ruled that IHL is <i>lex specialis </i>vis-&#224;-vis IHRL during armed conflicts. 
Thus, the parties must abide by the legal regime which has a more specific provision on point. The 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>6. Gross violations of either regime expose the perpetrator to criminal liability at the 
international level. Courts in any country can employ the principle of universal jurisdiction 
to try such cases. The definitional elements of international criminal law (ICL), have 
recently been bolstered with the adoption of the Rome Statute and the creation of the 
International Criminal Court (ICC), discussed below.  
</p>
<p>7. The specific applicability of each regime is discussed below. 
</p>
<p><b> III. International human rights law 
</b></p>
<p>8. At all times relevant to this report the Syrian Arab Republic was a party to the major 
United Nations human rights treaties and a number of optional protocols.5 The Government 
did not declare a state of emergency nor otherwise seek to derogate from any of the 
aforementioned obligations which consequently remained in effect throughout the conflict, 
irrespective of the applicability of other legal regimes.6 
</p>
<p>9. All branches of the Syrian government were therefore bound to respect, protect, 
promote and fulfill the human rights of all persons within its jurisdiction. The obligation 
included the right to afford an effective remedy to those whose rights were violated 
(including the provision of reparations) and to investigate and bring to justice perpetrators 
of particular violations.7 The Syrian Arab Republic was also bound by relevant rules of 
IHRL which form a part of customary international law. 
</p>
<p>  
analysis is fact specific and therefore each regime may apply, exclusive of the other, in specific 
circumstances. The Human Rights Committee generally concurs with this view as set out in the 
General Comment 31 to the ICCPR. &#8213;The Covenant applies also in situations of armed conflict to 
which the rules of international humanitarian law are applicable. While, in respect of certain 
Covenant rights, more specific rules of international humanitarian law may be specially relevant for 
the purposes of the interpretation of Covenant rights, both spheres of law are complementary, not 
mutually exclusive.&#8214; 
</p>
<p> 5 The International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights were ratified by the Syrian Arab Republic in 1969, the same year it ratified the Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The Syrian Arab Republic is also party to the 
Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women which it ratified in 2003, the 
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in 1955, the Convention 
against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment and Punishment in 2004 and the 
Convention on the Rights of Child in 1993. The Syrian Arab Republic ratified the Optional Protocol 
to the Convention on the Rights of Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict in 2003. 
The Syrian Arab Republic has not ratified the Convention on the Non-applicability of Statutory 
Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity.

<p> 7 See Human Rights Committee, General Comment No. 31 on The Nature of the General Legal 
Obligation Imposed on State Parties to the Covenant (2004), paras. 15&#8211;19. In this General Comment, 
the Human Rights Committee considered that the duty to bring perpetrators to justice attaches in 
particular to violations that are criminal under domestic or international law, torture and similar cruel, 
inhuman and degrading treatment, summary and arbitrary killing and enforced disappearance. See 
also the <i>Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of 
Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International 
</i></p>
<p><i>Humanitarian Law</i>, adopted by the General Assembly in December 2005, and the <i>Updated Set of 
Principles for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights through Action to Combat Impunity</i> 
(which were recognised in a consensus resolution of the UN Commission on Human Rights in 2005). </p>


<p>10. <i>Non-state actors and IHRL:</i> Non-state actors cannot formally become parties to 
international human rights treaties. They must nevertheless respect the fundamental human 
rights of persons forming customary international law (CIL), in areas where such actors 
exercise <i>de facto</i> control.8 The commission therefore examined allegations of human rights 
violations committed by the Syrian Government as well as abuses of customary 
international human rights norms perpetrated by the anti-Government armed groups. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. International humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p>11. International humanitarian law (IHL), also known as the law of armed conflict, is 
binding on all parties to a conflict.9 Its applicability is triggered whenever hostilities meet 
the threshold criteria of &#8213;armed conflict,&#8214; and applies irrespective of whether any party 
involved has in fact declared war. IHL comprises the four Geneva Conventions of 12 
August 1949 as well as its Protocols I and II and an array of other instruments and 
customary principles that protect those most vulnerable to the effects of armed conflict.10  
</p>
<p>12. The Syrian Arab Republic is a party to the Geneva Conventions and its Protocol I, as 
well as to several other IHL instruments concerning weaponry and mercenaries.11 The 
Syrian Arab Republic has not, however, ratified Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions 
which is specifically applicable during non-international armed conflict. A number of 
provisions of customary IHL nevertheless apply to non-international armed conflict and 
must be respected when the armed conflict threshold is met. The commission took note that 
a non-international armed conflict developed in the Syrian Arab Republic during February 
2012 which triggered the applicability of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions as 
well as customary law relevant to non-international armed conflict.  
</p>
<p>13. As the Security Council underlined in its resolution 1325 (2011), it is important for 
all States to apply fully the relevant norms of IHL and IHRL to women and girls, and to 
take special measures to protect women and girls from gender-based violence during armed 
conflict.12 
</p>
<p>  
 8 For a more expansive view of the application of IHRL, see Andrew Clapham, <i>Human Rights 
</i></p>
<p><i>Obligations of Non-State Actors</i> (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2006). To similar effect, see UN 
Secretary-General, <i>Report of the Secretary-General</i>&#8223;<i>s Panel of Experts on Accountability in Sri 
Lanka</i>, 31 March 2011, para. 188, available from: http://www.un.org/News/dh/infocus/ 
Sri_Lanka/POE_Report_Full.pdf. 
</p>
<p> 9 As the Special Court for Sierra Leone held, &#8213;it is well settled that all parties to an armed conflict, 
whether States or non-State actors, are bound by international humanitarian law, even though only 
States may become parties to international treaties.&#8214; See <i>Prosecutor v. Sam Hinga Norman</i>, case 
SCSL-2004-14-AR72(E), (31 May 2004), para. 22. Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions 
itself states that &#8213;each party ... shall be bound.&#8214; (emphasis added). 
</p>
<p> 10 One repository of the principles of customary IHL can be accessed in <i>Customary International 
Humanitarian Law</i> (3 vols.), by Jean-Marie Henckaerts and Louise Doswald-Beck for the 
International Committee of the Red Cross, (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2005) (<i>ICRC 
Study</i>). 
</p>
<p> 11 The Syrian Arab Republic is a party to the following treaties: The Protocol for the Prohibition of the 
Use of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare (1925); 
the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armies in the Field 
(1929); the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict(1954) 
and its Protocol(1954); the International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and

<p><b> V. International criminal law 
</b></p>
<p>14. International criminal law provides the means of enforcement at the international 
level of penalties for grave violations of customary law, IHRL and serious violations of 
IHL which are recognized as attracting individual liability. As noted, the ICC tries persons 
accused of such crimes, namely genocide, crimes against humanity, aggression and war 
crimes.13 The Rome Statute had been joined by 121 countries as of July 2012.14 Although 
the Syrian Arab Republic has signed the text, it has not yet become a party. Pursuant to its 
Article 13 (b), the Security Council can refer the situation of the Syrian Arab Republic to 
the ICC Prosecutor for investigation. At the time of writing, no such referral has been 
made. 
</p>
<p>15. <i>War crimes:</i> A complete listing of which actions constitute war crimes under the 
Rome Statute is contained within its Article 8. In the context of non-international armed 
conflict, this comprises serious violations of Common Article 3 and Protocol II, as well as 
other serious violations of international law.  
</p>
<p>16. <i>Crimes against humanity:</i> Crimes against humanity are those crimes which &#8213;shock 
the conscience of humanity&#8214;. Under the Rome Statute, crimes against humanity occur 
where certain acts are undertaken as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a 
civilian population where the perpetrator has knowledge of the attack.15 The elements of 
crimes against humanity are well established in international criminal law:16 
</p>
<p>1. There must be one or more attacks;  
</p>
<p>2. The acts of the perpetrator must be part of the attack(s);  
</p>
<p>3. The attack(s) must be directed against any civilian population;  
</p>
<p>4. The attack(s) must be widespread or systematic;  
</p>
<p>5. The perpetrator must know that his or her acts constitute part of a pattern of 
widespread or systematic crimes directed against a civilian population and know that 
his or her acts fit into such a pattern. 
</p>
<p>The underlying &#8213;acts&#8214; &#8212; or crimes &#8212; referred to in the above paragraph (2) have been 
enumerated in the Rome Statute.17 The list includes a number of the violations described 
elsewhere in this report, for example, unlawful killings;18 enforced disappearances;19 torture

 19 Article 7 (1) (h) of the Rome statute. See annex VII. </p>


<p>and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment;20 and/or rape,21 and therefore their 
elements are not repeated here. 
</p>
<p>17. <i>Widespread or systematic:</i> Widespread has long been defined as encompassing &#8213;the 
large scale nature of the attack, which should be massive, frequent, carried out collectively 
with considerable seriousness and directed against a multiplicity of victims&#8214;.22 As such, the 
element of &#8213;widespread&#8214; refers both to the large-scale nature of the attack and the number 
of resultant victims. The assessment is neither exclusively quantitative nor geographical, 
but must be carried out on the basis of the individual facts. Accordingly, a widespread 
attack may be the &#8213;cumulative effect of a series of inhumane acts or the singular effect of 
</p>
<p>an inhumane act of extraordinary magnitude&#8214;.23 
</p>
<p>18. In contrast, the term &#8213;systematic&#8214; refers to: 
</p>
<p>the &#8220;organised nature of the acts of violence and the improbability of their random 
</p>
<p>occurrence&#8221; (citations omitted). An attack&#8223;s systematic nature can &#8220;often be 
</p>
<p><i>expressed through patterns of crimes, in the sense of non-accidental repetition of 
</i></p>
<p>similar criminal conduct on a regular basis&#8221;. The Chamber notes that the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;systematic&#8221; element has been defined by the ICTR as (i) being thoroughly 
</p>
<p><i>organised, (ii) following a regular pattern, (iii) on the basis of a common policy, 
</i></p>
<p><i>and (iv) involving substantial public or private resources (citations omitted), whilst 
</i></p>
<p><i>the ICTY has determined that the element requires (i) a political objective or plan, 
</i></p>
<p><i>(ii) large-scale or continuous commission of crimes which are linked, (iii) use of 
</i></p>
<p><i>significant public or private resources, and (iv) the implication of high-level 
</i></p>
<p><i>political and/or military authorities.</i>24 
</p>
<p>19. It is important to note that crimes against humanity need not be both widespread and 
systematic. The test is disjunctive, and therefore reaching either element suffices. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Customary international law 
</b></p>
<p>20. Customary International Law is made up of norms of (inter)state behaviour that have 
developed over time and that have become binding among states in their international 
relations. Treaties are often the codification of CIL norms. CIL is an inseparable component 
of both IHL and IHRL. The relationship between those two legal regimes and CIL can be 
expressed in terms of specific crimes or violations, for example, those set out in the Rome 
Statute. CIL is identified by legal scholars, courts, military law experts, and, for example, 
the ICRC.25 CIL contains a number of core precepts such as distinction of civilians, 
prohibition on indiscriminate attacks, that feasible precautions are undertaken, the principle 
of humanity (no unnecessary suffering), and imperative military necessity.

customary international humanitarian legal norms. </p>


<p><b> VII. State obligations to investigate, prosecute, punish and 
provide reparations 
</b></p>
<p>21. Customary law, IHL and IHRL obligate states to investigate allegations of serious 
violations of their respective regimes and, when appropriate, prosecute suspected 
perpetrators and compensate the victims. The UN General Assembly expressed the 
obligation in the clearest of terms when it declared in the &#8213;Basic Principles on the Right to 
Remedy,&#8214;  
</p>
<p>&#8220;In cases of gross violations of international human rights law and serious 
</p>
<p><i>violations of international humanitarian law constituting crimes under international 
</i></p>
<p><i>law, States have the duty to investigate and, if there is sufficient evidence, the duty to 
</i></p>
<p><i>submit to prosecution the person allegedly responsible for the violations and, if 
</i></p>
<p>found guilty, the duty to punish her or him.&#8221;26 
</p>
<p>22. The obligation is founded in part on Article 2 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights (ICCPR),27 wherein an effective remedy is required. The obligation to 
investigate is specifically confirmed in the interpretation given that provision by the Human 
Rights Committee.28  
</p>
<p>23. The obligation is slightly different for internal armed conflicts under IHL. There, the 
obligation to investigate war crimes and prosecute the suspects is a matter of customary 
law.29 The notion has been reaffirmed on several occasions by the UN Security Council 
specifically in relation to the conflicts in Afghanistan, Burundi, Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, Kosovo and Rwanda.30 In a resolution on impunity adopted without a vote in 2002, 
the UN Commission on Human Rights recognized that perpetrators of war crimes should be 
prosecuted or extradited.31 The commission has similarly adopted resolutions &#8212; most of 
them without a vote &#8212; requiring the investigation and prosecution of persons alleged to 
have violated IHL in the internal armed conflicts in Sierra Leone, Chechnya, Rwanda, 
Sudan, Burundi and the former Yugoslavia. It is now broadly regarded as a customary 
international legal obligation to investigate and punish alleged perpetrators of IHL 
violations &#8211; in either international or non-international armed conflicts.32  
</p>
<p>24. It is thus beyond doubt that each instance of alleged gross human rights violation, 
and all &#8213;serious&#8214; IHL violations &#8212; perpetrated by individuals on either side of the conflict 
in the Syrian Arab Republic &#8212; must be investigated, and, if appropriate, prosecuted. A 
</p>
<p>  
 26 See Supra, fn 43, <i>Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for 
</i></p>
<p><i>Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of 
</i></p>
<p><i>International Humanitarian Law</i>, UNGA Resolution 60/147, 16 Dec. 2005, Art. 4. 
 27 Article 2 of ICCPR requires a State party to respect and ensure to all individuals within its territory 
</p>
<p>and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in it and also to ensure an effective remedy for any 
person whose rights have been violated. 
</p>
<p> 28 General Comment 31, para. 8. 
 29 Unlike in internal conflicts, the obligation in international armed conflicts rests not only with 
</p>
<p>customary law, but also with the &#8213;grave breaches regime,&#8214; set out in the four Geneva Conventions. 
See Article 49 of the First Geneva Convention, Article 50 of the Second Geneva Convention, article 
129 of the Third Geneva Convention and article 146 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. The &#8215;grave 
breaches regime&#8216; contains a specific list of crimes that, whenever violated, oblige the state to &#8215;try or 
extradite&#8216; the suspected perpetrator. The International Humanitarian Fact Finding Commission, 
http://www.ihffc.org/, was set up for the purpose of conducting such investigations. 
</p>
<p> 30 UN Security Council, Res.978 (&#167;558), Res.1193 (&#167;559) and Res.1199 (&#167;560); UN Security Council, 
Statements by the President (&#167;&#167;561&#8211;569). 
</p>
<p> 31 UN Commission on Human Rights, Res.2002/79 (&#167;589). 
 32 See ICRC&#8216;s Customary IHL Rule 158. </p>


<p>final point to be made concerns the nature of the investigation that must be conducted to 
satisfy this obligation. The UN has developed guidelines for such investigations and they 
center around four universal principles: independence, effectiveness, promptness and 
impartiality.33 These four principles lie at the heart of human rights protection and are 
binding on UN members in that they have been relied upon and further developed in the 
jurisprudence of UN-backed international courts and also have been agreed upon by the 
States represented within the relevant United Nations bodies. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. State responsibility 
</b></p>
<p>25. Every internationally wrongful act of a State incurs the international responsibility 
of that State.34 Similarly, customary international law provides that a State is responsible for 
all acts committed by members of its military and security forces.35 The State is therefore 
responsible for wrongful acts, including crimes against humanity, committed by members 
of its military and security forces. 
</p>
<p>26. The prohibition of crimes against humanity is a <i>jus</i> <i>cogens</i> or peremptory rule, and 
the punishment of such crimes is obligatory pursuant to the general principles of 
international law.36 Furthermore, crimes against humanity are the culmination of violations 
of fundamental human rights, such as the right to life and the prohibition of torture or other 
forms of inhuman and degrading treatment.37 According to the principles of State 
responsibility in international law, the Syrian Arab Republic bears responsibility for these 
crimes and violations, and bears the duty to ensure that individual perpetrators are punished 
and that victims receive reparation.38 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Individual responsibility  
</b></p>
<p>27. The principle of individual criminal responsibility for international crimes is well 
established in customary international law.39 According to article 27 of the Rome Statute of 
the International Criminal Court, which the Syrian Arab Republic has signed but not 
ratified, the Statute applies equally to all persons, without any distinction based on official 
capacity. In this context, Syrian laws afford extensive immunities, in most cases, for crimes

<p>committed by Government agents at all levels during the exercise of their duties. Although 
the Independent Special Legal Commission was established in recent months to investigate 
events, the State still has not provided the commission with any details of investigations or 
prosecutions under way by this mechanism. 
</p>
<p><b> X. Elements of specific violations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Excessive use of force 
</b></p>
<p>28. Excessive use of force by law enforcement officials (whether police or military or 
other members of State security forces) impinges on fundamental human rights guarantees, 
including the right to life (Article 6 ICCPR) and security of persons (Article 9 ICCPR). 
International standards such as the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials (<i>Code 
of Conduct</i>) and the <i>Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law 
Enforcement Officials (Basic Principals) </i>provide further guidance for public order officials 
operating in potentially violent circumstances. Non-violent means are to be used as far as 
possible before resorting to the use of force (principle of &#8213;necessity&#8214;), and any use of force 
</p>
<p>must be limited to that which is proportionate to the seriousness of the offence and the 
legitimate objective to be achieved (principle of &#8213;proportionality&#8214;). Firearms are to be used 
only in self-defence or in defence of others against imminent threat of death or serious 
injury; to prevent a particularly serious crime involving grave threat to life; or to arrest a 
person posing such a threat and who is resisting efforts to stop the threat or to prevent that 
person&#8216;s escape. Before using firearms, law enforcement officials must identify themselves 
</p>
<p>as law enforcement officials and give a clear warning that firearms will be used. Further, 
sufficient time must be provided for the warning to be observed, unless this would unduly 
create a risk of death or serious harm to the officer or other persons or would be clearly 
inappropriate or pointless in the circumstances.40 
</p>
<p>29. IHL contains provisions similarly constraining the use of force under its requirement 
for proportionality in attack.41 War-time attacks, even when carefully planned, frequently 
result in the loss of life or injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects. Under the rule 
requiring proportionality, a party is required to forego any offensive where the incidental 
damage expected &#8213;is excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage 
</p>
<p>anticipated&#8214;. Thus, where the military advantage is outweighed by the damage or death to 
civilians and their objects, the attack is forbidden. This rule applies despite the recognition 
that incidental injury to civilians, so&#8211;called &#8213;collateral damage&#8214;, may occur even when an 
attack is lawful.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Unlawful killing 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Arbitrary deprivation of life 
</b></p>
<p>30. IHRL strictly prohibits taking life arbitrarily, a restriction that bars state actors from 
killing a person outside a legitimate and legal basis for doing so. Those legitimate bases are 
twofold. First, when a fully-fledged judicial process in line with international standards has 
been followed. Second, in the most narrow of circumstances, where a person&#8216;s life is under 
</p>
<p>imminent threat.  
</p>
<p>  
 40 See Article 3 of the <i>Code of Conduct.</i> See generally the <i>Basic Principles</i>. 
 41 ICRC Study Rule 14. </p>


<p>31. Moreover, a state-sponsored deprivation of life will be arbitrary in the legal sense 
unless it is both necessary and proportionate. Therefore, when a state actor employs lethal 
force it must be in order to protect life (i.e., it must be proportionate) and there must also be 
no other means available, such as capture or incapacitation, to curtail that threat to life (i.e., 
it must be necessary). Only under these limited circumstances is the resort to lethal force by 
the State legal.  
</p>
<p>32. The noted IHRL standards differ to a degree from those applicable to 
fighters/combatants during an armed conflict under IHL. For example, one would not 
expect soldiers to warn their enemies before an attack. So long as all applicable IHL, CIL 
and IHRL requirements are met, killing an enemy fighter during an armed conflict is not 
illegal. The converse is also true: fighters/combatants causing another person&#8216;s death, even 
that of the enemy, during armed conflict can be unlawful when the applicable law is 
breached (see below). 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Murder as a war crime 
</b></p>
<p>33. In specific circumstances, killing another person during an armed conflict is murder 
(also known as &#8213;wilful killing&#8214; when committed in the course of an international armed 
</p>
<p>conflict). The crime of murder is a recognized offense under customary law and has been 
codified in the Rome Statute. In non-international armed conflict, the elements comprising 
the war crime of murder are as follows: 
</p>
<p>(i) The perpetrator killed one or more persons; 
</p>
<p>(ii) Such person or persons were either <i>hors de combat</i>, or were civilians, 
medical personnel, or religious personnel taking no active part in the hostilities;  
</p>
<p>(iii) The perpetrator was aware of the factual circumstances that established this 
status; 
</p>
<p>(iv) The conduct took place in the context of and was associated with an armed 
conflict not of an international character; 
</p>
<p>(v) The perpetrator was aware of factual circumstances that established the 
existence of an armed conflict.  
</p>
<p>34. Thus, murder is committed upon the intentional killing of a protected person in the 
context of an armed conflict when the perpetrator is aware of the circumstances of the 
victim and the conflict itself. Interpretations given by the international courts to the 
elements of murder largely mirror those of traditional criminal law. For example, even 
where the perpetrator does not directly kill the victim at his own hand, the act(s) of the 
perpetrator must at least be a &#8213;substantial cause of the death&#8214; of the victim. Premeditation 
</p>
<p>does not appear as a required element. 
</p>
<p>35. Murder can also be prosecuted as a crime against humanity when it is perpetrated in 
the context of a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population - whether 
conducted in a time of war or peace. The mental element of murder as a crime against 
humanity not only includes the intent to cause someone&#8216;s death but also the knowledge of 
the act being part of a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Attacks on protected persons and objects; Indiscriminate attacks 
</b></p>
<p>36. IHL prohibits the intentional targeting of civilians in both international and non-
international armed conflicts. Violations of this provision are prosecutable in ICL, </p>


<p>including at the ICC.42 Parties to a conflict have an obligation to distinguish at all times 
between those taking part in hostilities and the civilian population, and they must direct 
attacks only against military objectives. Referred to as the &#8213;principle of distinction&#8214;, the 
</p>
<p>International Court of Justice in its Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996 on the Legality of the 
Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, recognised this principle as &#8213;intransgressible&#8214; in 
customary international law.  
</p>
<p>37. Attacks on places where both civilians and combatants may be found are prohibited 
if they are not directed at a specific military objective, or if they use methods or means of 
combat which cannot be directed at a specific military objective. It is prohibited to launch 
an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, 
and/or damage to civilian objects which would be excessive in relation to the anticipated 
concrete and direct military advantage.  
</p>
<p>38. Customary IHL establishes that all &#8213;parties to the conflict must take all feasible 
precautions to protect the civilian population and civilian objects under their control against 
the effects of attacks&#8214;. Each party to the conflict must, to the extent feasible, avoid locating 
military objectives within or near densely populated areas. Each party to the conflict must, 
to the extent feasible, remove civilian persons and objects under its control from the 
vicinity of military objectives.  
</p>
<p>39. Attacking, destroying, removing or otherwise rendering useless objects which are 
indispensable to the survival of the civilian population is prohibited. Sieges must still allow 
for vital foodstuffs and other essential supplies to be delivered to the civilian population.  
</p>
<p>40. Medical personnel as well as hospitals, medical units and transport must be 
respected and protected in all circumstances. Medical personnel, units and transport lose 
their protection if they are being used, outside their humanitarian function, to commit acts 
harmful to the enemy.  
</p>
<p>41. IHL also incorporates specific protections for objects. It is prohibited to commit an 
act of hostility directed against places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual 
heritage of peoples.  
</p>
<p>42. The Rome Statute sets out a number of war crimes which correspond to these 
breaches of IHL guarantees. They include the crime of intentionally attacking civilians, and 
intentionally attacking civilian buildings dedicated to religion, education, art, science or 
charitable purposes, historic monuments, hospitals and places where the sick and wounded 
are collected.43  
</p>
<p><b> C. Arbitrary arrest and unlawful detention 
</b></p>
<p>43. Article 9 of the ICCPR prohibits arbitrary arrest or detention of individuals. It 
provides that &#8213;no one shall be deprived of liberty except on such grounds in accordance 
</p>
<p>with such procedures as are established by law&#8214;. Persons arrested are to be informed at the 
</p>
<p>time of arrest of the reasons for the arrest and promptly informed of any charges.44 Anyone 
arrested or detained on a criminal charge is to be brought promptly before a judge or other 
officer authorized by law to exercise judicial power and is entitled to trial within a 
reasonable period or release.45 Persons have a right to take proceedings before a court for 
the purposes of reviewing the lawfulness of detention and to be released if the detention is 
</p>
<p>  
 42 Rome Statute, Art. 8 (2) (e) (i)&#8211;(iv). 
 43 Rome Statute, Art. 8 (2) (e) (iv). 
 44 Article 9 (2) ICCPR. 
 45 Article 9 (3) ICCPR. </p>


<p>unlawful.46 The term &#8213;arbitrary&#8214; needs to be considered in terms of appropriateness, 
proportionality and reasonableness.47 Lawfulness of detention is to be considered as both 
lawfulness under domestic law and lawfulness under international law.48 
</p>
<p>44. The commission therefore notes the conditions of detention provided for in the 
Syrian Arab Republic&#8216;s domestic law. Article 4 of the State of Emergency Act (SEA) 
authorises the Military Governor to impose, through oral or written orders, &#8213;restrictions on 
</p>
<p>the rights of people to the freedom of assembly, residence, transport, and movement, and to 
arrest suspected people or those threatening public security on a temporary basis, and to 
authorize investigations of persons and places at any time, and to allow any person to 
perform any task&#8214;.49 This provision has provided grounds for the arrest of peaceful 
demonstrators.  
</p>
<p>45. The SEA also provides for the detention of suspects for &#8213;crimes committed against 
State security and public order&#8214; and &#8213;crimes committed against public authorities&#8214;.50 The 
commission observes that these crimes do not appear to be further defined in the Syrian 
Arab Republic&#8216;s domestic laws. The SEA also permits the security forces to hold suspects 
in preventive detention without judicial oversight for indefinite periods. 
</p>
<p>46. The commission observes that in April 2011, the Syrian Arab Republic&#8216;s Code of 
Criminal Procedure &#8212; which previously required suspects to be brought before a judicial 
authority within 24 hours of arrest or else be released51 &#8212; was amended to allow suspects 
to be held for up to seven days, pending investigation and the interrogation of suspects for 
certain crimes. This period is renewable up to a maximum of 60 days.52 
</p>
<p><b> D. Enforced disappearance 
</b></p>
<p>47. While the Syrian Arab Republic is not a party to the specialized convention 
concerning enforced disappearances,53 it is a party to the ICCPR, provisions of which are 
infringed by enforced disappearance. Such action violates a person&#8216;s right to recognition as 
</p>
<p>a person before the law,54 to liberty and security and freedom from arbitrary detention, 
including the right to be brought promptly before a judge or other official for review of the 
lawfulness of detention. Disappearance may also be associated with torture and other forms 
of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and extrajudicial execution, in violation of the 
right to life, prohibition on torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment.55  
</p>
<p>  
 46 The ICCPR also provides for a right of compensation for unlawful arrest or detention.

 55 The Human Rights Committee in its General Comment No 20 (1992), para. 11, on Article 7 of the 
</p>
<p>ICCPR, recognized that safeguards against torture included having provisions against incommunicado 
 </p>


<p>48. Under IHL, persons taking no active part in the hostilities are entitled to be treated 
humanely.56 Customary IHL rules also include a prohibition on arbitrary deprivation of 
liberty57 and require parties to the conflict to keep a register of persons deprived of their 
liberty,58 respect detainees&#8216; family life, to permit detainees to receive visitors, especially 
near relatives to the degree practicable and allow correspondence between detainees and 
their families.  
</p>
<p>49. Parties to a conflict must take all feasible measure to account for persons reported 
missing as a result of the conflict and efforts must be made to provide family members with 
any information the Party has on their fate. The practice of enforced disappearance also 
may be a gateway to other violations such as torture, murder or extra judicial executions. 
The combined effect of particular IHL obligations leads to the conclusion that the practice 
of disappearance is prohibited by customary IHL.  
</p>
<p>50. Furthermore, &#8213;imprisonment or other severe deprivation of liberty in violation of 
fundamental rules of international law&#8214; and enforced disappearance are acts recognized in 
</p>
<p>the Rome Statute as potentially giving rise to a crime against humanity if committed as part 
of a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population, with knowledge of the 
attack.59 Integral to the finding of a crime of &#8213;enforced disappearance&#8214; is a refusal to 
acknowledge the arrest, detention or abduction, or to give information on the fate or 
whereabouts of such person or persons.60 
</p>
<p><b> E.  Torture and other forms of ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p>51. Under IHRL, there is a clear prohibition on torture and other forms of cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment in Article 7 of the ICCPR. The Convention Against 
Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) provides a 
fuller definition: &#8213;torture&#8214; means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether 
</p>
<p>physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining 
from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a 
third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or 
coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when 
such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or 
acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.  
</p>
<p>52. Torture during armed conflict is both a violation of IHL and a breach of 
international criminal law. Torture must not be balanced against national security interests 
or even the protection of other human rights. No limitations are permitted on the prohibition 
of torture. International humanitarian law explicitly prohibits the torture and cruel treatment 
of persons taking no active part in hostilities (including members of armed forces who have 
laid down their arms or been rendered <i>hors de combat</i>). Such conduct constitutes a war 
crime.  
</p>
<p>  
detention, granting detainees suitable access to persons such as doctors, lawyers and family members, 
ensuring detainees are held in places that are officially recognized as places of detention and for their 
names and places of detention, as well as for the names of persons responsible for their detention, to 
be kept in registers readily available and accessible to those concerned, including relatives and 
friends.

 58 ICRC Study, Rule 123. 
 59 Rome Statute, Art. 7 (1) (i). 
 60 ICC Elements of Crimes, Article 7 (1) (i). </p>


<p>53. Torture can form part of a crime against humanity. The ICC&#8216;s Elements of Crimes 
set out the following elements for the crime of torture during armed conflict: 
</p>
<p>(i) The perpetrator inflicted severe physical or mental pain or suffering upon one 
or more persons; 
</p>
<p>(ii) The perpetrator inflicted the pain or suffering for such purposes as:  
</p>
<p>(1) Obtaining information or a confession; 
</p>
<p>(2) Punishment;  
</p>
<p>(3) Intimidation or coercion;  
</p>
<p>(4) Or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind.  
</p>
<p>54. The definition, both under CAT and under the ICC&#8216;s Elements of Crimes, provides 
that &#8213;severe&#8214; pain must be inflicted. International tribunals and human rights bodies have, 
</p>
<p>to date, found the following acts constituted torture: kicking, hitting, beating (including 
beating on the soles of the feet), flogging, shaking violently, inflicting electric shocks, 
burning, subjecting the victim to &#8213;water treatment&#8214;, extended hanging from hand and/or leg 
</p>
<p>chains and suffocation/asphyxiation. Mental torture has been found to have occurred where 
the perpetrator threatened the victim with death or simulates an execution, while having the 
means to carry it out. These acts have been held to constitute torture irrespective of any 
subjectively experienced pain of the victim. 
</p>
<p>55. In its General Comment, the Committee Against Torture emphasised that an 
obligation on all state authorities exists in respect of torture. Any official who has 
reasonable grounds to believe that acts of torture or ill-treatment are being committed is 
obliged to prevent, investigate, prosecute and punish. Otherwise, the State bears 
responsibility and its officials will be individually considered as complicit or otherwise 
responsible &#8213;for acquiescing in such impermissible acts&#8214;. Investigations should be 
</p>
<p>conducted in accordance with the Principles on the Effective Investigation and 
Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment.  
</p>
<p>56. All persons detained in connection with an armed conflict must be treated humanely. 
At the end of armed conflict, persons deprived of their liberty enjoy the protection afforded 
under Articles 5 and 6 of Protocol II, or at a minimum such protections as are recognized as 
customary law, until their release.  
</p>
<p>57. The United Nations has developed a comprehensive set of standards to be enforced 
in places of detention. The underlying principles, based in IHL and IHRL, are humane 
treatment and non-discrimination. Particularly relevant is Protection Principle 7 which 
requires that all maltreatment of detainees be investigated and punished. 
</p>
<p>58. The commission notes that according to the 2012 Syrian Constitution, &#8213;[n]o one 
may be subjected to torture or to degrading treatment and the law shall define the 
punishment for any person who commits such acts&#8214;.61 Further, Article 391 of the Syrian 
Criminal Code stipulates that: &#8213;Anyone who batters a person with a degree of force that is 
not permitted by law in order to extract a confession to, or information about, an offence 
shall be subject to a penalty of from three months to three years in prison&#8214;.62 These 
provisions do not, however, further define the crime of torture. 
</p>
<p>  
 61 Syrian Constitution, Article 53. 
 62 Law No. 148/1949 of the Syrian Criminal Code. </p>


<p><b> F. Rape and sexual violence 
</b></p>
<p>59. Rape violates the prohibition on torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
and also impairs other human rights including the right to the highest attainable standard of 
physical and mental health under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights (ICESCR). It is also expressly prohibited in armed conflict. Common 
article 3 to the Geneva Conventions also prohibits &#8213;violence to life and person, in particular 
&#8230; cruel treatment and torture&#8214; and &#8213;outrages upon personal dignity, in particular, 
</p>
<p>humiliating and degrading treatment&#8214;. Rape constitutes a war crime under the Rome Statute 
</p>
<p>as well as potentially constituting a crime against humanity if it is part of a widespread or 
systematic attack on civilians. The elements of the crime of rape in non-international armed 
conflicts in the Rome Statute are as follows:  
</p>
<p>(i) The perpetrator invaded the body of a person by conduct resulting in 
penetration, however slight, of any part of the body of the victim or of the 
perpetrator with a sexual organ, or of the anal or genital opening of the victim with 
any object or any other part of the body; 
</p>
<p>(ii) The invasion was committed by force, or by threat of force or coercion, such 
as that caused by fear of violence, duress, detention, psychological oppression or 
abuse of power, against such person or another person, or by taking advantage of a 
coercive environment, or the invasion was committed against a person incapable of 
giving genuine consent; 
</p>
<p>(iii) The conduct took place in the context of and was associated with an armed 
conflict not of an international character; 
</p>
<p>(iv) The perpetrator was aware of factual circumstances that established the 
existence of an armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>60. The Security Council has urged parties to armed conflict to protect women and 
children from sexual violence. Its resolution 1325 (2000) calls on all parties to the conflict 
to take special measures to protect women and girls from rape and others forms of sexual 
abuse and its resolution 1820 (2008) stresses that &#8213;sexual violence, when used or 
</p>
<p>commissioned as a tactic of war in order to deliberately target civilians or as part of a 
widespread or systematic attack against civilian populations, can significantly exacerbate 
situations of armed conflict&#8214;. 
</p>
<p>61. Sexual violence can meet the definition of torture and has been prosecuted as such.  
</p>
<p><b> G.  Children and armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>62. The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) generally defines a child as any 
person under the age of 18. However, with respect to armed conflict, the Convention draws 
its language from the Protocols to the Geneva Conventions, and consequently sets the lower 
age of 15 as the minimum for recruitment or participation in armed forces.  
</p>
<p>63. The Optional Protocol, which the Syrian Arab Republic adopted in 2003, without 
reservation, sets 18 as the minimum age for direct participation in hostilities, for 
recruitment into armed groups and for compulsory recruitment by governments. 
</p>
<p>64. Under the Rome Statute, it is a war crime to use, conscript or enlist children under 
the age of 15 years into armed forces or use them to participate actively in hostilities.63  
</p>
<p>  
 63 Rome Statute, Art. 8 (2) (e) (vii). </p>


<p>65. Active participation in hostilities does not solely denote children&#8216;s direct 
participation in combat but encompasses activities linked to combat such as scouting, 
spying, sabotage, and the use of children as decoys, couriers, or at military checkpoints. 
Also prohibited is the use of children in &#8213;direct&#8214; support functions such as carrying supplies 
to the front line. 
</p>
<p>66. The commission notes that international law requires that child detainees must be 
separated from adults, unless to do so would involve a violation of the right of families to 
be housed together. The requirement to incarcerate child and adult detainees separately is 
set forth in the CRC.64 
</p>
<p><b> H. Pillaging 
</b></p>
<p>67. By definition pillage (or plunder) is theft within the context of, and in connection 
with, an armed conflict. Under the Rome Statute, pillage is &#8213;the forcible taking of private 
property by an invading or conquering army from the enemy&#8216;s subjects&#8214;.65 The Elements of 
Crimes of the ICC specify that the appropriation must be done for private or personal use. 
The prohibition of pillage is a long-standing rule of customary and treaty-based 
international law. It constitutes a war crime to pillage a town or place, even when taken by 
assault. 
</p>
<p><b> I.  Destruction of personal property 
</b></p>
<p>68.  International human rights law protects an individual&#8216;s home from interference by 
the State. Article 17 of the ICCPR prohibits arbitrary or unlawful interference with a 
person&#8216;s home or correspondence. The Human Rights Committee has interpreted this 
</p>
<p>provision to mean that no interference can take place except in cases envisaged by the law, 
and that law must comport with the objectives of the ICCPR.66 Article 11 of the ICESCR 
commits States Parties to providing everyone &#8213;an adequate standard of living for himself 
</p>
<p>and his family, including housing, and to the continuous improvement of living 
conditions&#8214;.

<p><b>Annex III 
</b></p>
<p>[<i>English only</i>] 
</p>
<p><b>  Military situation 
</b></p>
<p>1. During this reporting period, the military situation has deteriorated significantly with 
armed violence gaining in intensity and spreading to new areas. While events in the Syrian 
Arab Republic were once viewed as an excessive use of force against peaceful 
demonstrators, the dynamics of the crisis have shifted dramatically. Active hostilities 
between Government forces (and pro-Government militia) and anti-Government armed 
groups took place across broad sections of the country. Sporadic clashes between the armed 
actors have evolved into continuous combat, involving more brutal tactics and new military 
capabilities by both sides. Levels of armed violence vary throughout the country.  
</p>
<p><b> I. Government forces and pro-Government militia 
</b></p>
<p>2. As the Syrian Government attempts to re-establish its authority in areas which have 
fallen, or are at risk of falling, under the <i>de facto</i> control of anti-Government armed groups, 
it has increasingly engaged its military troops and heavy equipment, such as tanks and 
helicopters, in operations against areas perceived to be in support of the armed groups.  
</p>
<p>3. All army divisions and security services have engaged in military operations that 
varied in terms of used capabilities, tactics and scale according to the confronted armed 
group&#8216;s size, capabilities and degree of influence and support. Military operations 
</p>
<p>consistently begin with Government forces deploying reinforcements to establish 
checkpoints around the periphery of a targeted area. This differs from the previous 
approach which focused on establishing checkpoints within the area. Defections among 
deployed soldiers and repeated attacks on isolated checkpoints by anti-Government armed 
groups were reportedly behind this tactical shift. Once the area has been cordoned, artillery 
and tank units &#8212; increasingly joined by helicopters &#8212; conduct shelling before ground 
forces raid the area to dislodge the insurgents. Security forces and pro-Government militia, 
including <i>Shabbiha</i>, have reportedly been involved in these final clearing operations, which 
often involve house-to-house searches.  
</p>
<p>4. The use of heavy fire assets, such as artillery and helicopters, which earlier had been 
limited to certain areas such as Homs city and Zabadani, in Rif Dimashq, has been extended 
to all restive provinces. While previously mortars and artillery shelling had been used as a 
prelude to incursions by ground forces, they are regularly employed in the context of 
clashes, when quelling demonstrations, and when Government forces are unable to regain 
control of a contested area. The use of air assets, once limited to observation and 
transportation purposes, was also extended to fire support; as attack helicopters were used 
to shell localities under the control of anti-Government armed groups. 
</p>
<p>5. In the face of rising insurgency, Government forces directed their main efforts 
towards the control of major population centres such as Damascus, Aleppo, Homs and 
Hama. They targeted suburban towns and neighbourhoods of these major localities which 
were perceived to have been infiltrated by anti-Government armed groups. Their attacks on 
such areas had the unintended effect of increasing the local populations&#8216; support for those 
</p>
<p>groups. Simultaneously, operations with heavy artillery and helicopters shelling were 
conducted to neutralize the anti-Government armed groups&#8216; influence in key countryside 
towns located along main lines of communication such as in Sahl Al-Ghab between Hama </p>


<p>and Idlib governorates, and the Northern Aleppo countryside. During many of these 
operations, large numbers of fighters and civilians were killed. 
</p>
<p>6. According to testimonies received by the commission, <i>Shabbiha</i>, continues to act 
alongside Government forces in security and military operations. With the increased 
militarization of the crisis, <i>Shabbiha</i> has supported army units by conducting raids and 
clearing operations once Government forces re-established control of targeted localities. 
Nevertheless, the composition, strength, and level of involvement of this militia remain 
opaque. The role of Syrian authorities in supporting this militia could not be ascertained 
with a sufficient degree of certainty. In part, this difficulty stems from the diverse use of the 
term &#8213;<i>Shabbiha</i>&#8214;. Many of those interviewed by the commission use the term to refer to any 
armed individual dressed in civilian clothes or in mixed civilian and military clothes. 
Others report that, in some areas, the <i>Shabbiha</i> are composed of civilians of neighbouring 
villages predominantly populated by Alawites. Some interviewees claim that<i> Shabbiha</i> are 
organised, trained and paid by central or regional authorities, while others have stated they 
are local volunteers, with loyalties to the Government arising from ethnicity and/or a fear of 
the consequences of the fall of Government on them and their families. While it is evident 
that <i>Shabbiha</i> act in concert with Government forces, their precise nature and the 
relationship between the <i>Shabbiha </i>and the Government remains unclear. 
</p>
<p>7. Government forces faced increased attrition in personnel and equipment due to 
combat operations, defections and casualties. While the number and level of defections are 
not yet having an operational impact, they had a psychological effect on the troops, thus 
fuelling a crisis of confidence within the ranks and encouraging further defections. 
Defections continued steadily but reach their peaks particularly in the aftermath of military 
operations. The Government also faced difficulties in drafting new recruits; as those called 
in for mandatory military service refuse to report. This situation forced the leadership to 
extend the conscription of those already serving in the ranks which, in turn, has created 
frustration and further defections among them. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Anti-Government armed groups  
</b></p>
<p>8. During the reporting period, anti-Government armed groups continued to engage 
with Government forces through direct clashes and ambushes, the use of Improvised 
Explosive Devices (IEDs) and raids on military/security facilities.  
</p>
<p>9. Despite the apparent absence of an overall effective command structure, the FSA 
continued to &#8213;represent&#8214; the main anti-Government armed group with a significant number 
of groups claiming affiliation to it. The FSA has created Local Military Councils in specific 
governorates which claim leadership over fighting groups operating in each of those areas. 
High-ranking defectors within the FSA have also announced the creation of a new 
command structure, namely the Joint Military Command of the Syrian Revolution, in 
charge of organizing and unifying all armed groups, coordinating military activities with 
political partners and managing security and stability in the transitional period.  
</p>
<p>10. Anti-Government armed groups vary in terms of capabilities, composition and 
tactics. At one end of the spectrum, there are small groups operating at the local level, 
mainly composed of civilians and defectors from the area, and often eluding direct 
confrontations with Government forces by temporarily withdrawing from their villages 
during army raids. Such groups mainly use IEDs attacks, overnight raids and low scale 
ambushes on small military units and facilities. On the other end, there are increasingly 
larger groups that have succeeded in integrating a number of smaller groups, and which are 
able to control some territory, directly confront army units in urban environment for days 
and conduct coordinated attacks on army positions and large convoys. The longer these </p>


<p>groups have been able to control territories, the better they were then able to regroup and 
organize in the event of being ousted. Many groups claim affiliation to the FSA, while 
some others reject it but increasingly coordinate their actions, and support each other with 
fighters and equipment. Accounts indicate the existence of foreign fighters in the ranks of 
some armed groups. The commission has not, however, been able to determine their 
significance. 
</p>
<p>11. Anti-Government armed groups expanded their presence and activities throughout 
the country, clashing simultaneously with Government forces on multiple fronts. While 
Homs governorate was for months the main open battlefield between anti-Government 
armed groups and Government forces, military confrontations have spread to several other 
cities and regions, including Rif Dimashq, Aleppo and Deir el-Zour. At the time of writing, 
they are reportedly involved in sustained armed confrontations inside the capital, while 
establishing sanctuaries throughout the rest of the country.  
</p>
<p>12. By July 2012, anti-Government armed groups had extended their influence to further 
areas in Homs, Dar&#8216;a, Sahl Al Ghab in northern Hama, Idlib countryside, Deir el-Zour and 
north and west of Aleppo as a result of their increased ability to coordinate their operations 
at the provincial level. Anti-Government armed groups have also expanded the eastern front 
in Deir el-Zour, requiring the Syrian forces to re-deploy key units from the Damascus area, 
geographically stretching State forces and forcing the regime to deploy its strongest 
military units.  
</p>
<p>13. Anti-Government armed groups have increased their attacks on key infrastructure, 
such as oil installations and electrical plants. They have seriously undermined Government 
forces&#8216; control of the country&#8216;s borders, leading most recently to their temporary control of 
some border crossing points. Cross-border movements of refugees as well as of anti-
Government fighters appears to be more frequent, dense and fluid, although crossing the 
border through official crossing points remains a perilous trip in some areas. 
</p>
<p>14. During the reporting period, investigations have not confirmed the use of more 
sophisticated weaponry by anti-Government armed groups. However, their capacity to 
access and effectively use available weapons has improved. Anti-Government armed 
groups appeared to have increasing access to more funding and logistical support, such as 
ammunition and small arms. Some anti-Government armed groups also possess mortars and 
anti-tank missiles, reportedly looted during seizure of army positions. The level of 
destruction lately observed on destroyed government equipment indicates the use of new 
military capabilities such as anti-tank weapons.  
</p>
<p>15. The Commission has noted the increased and more efficient use of IEDs by anti-
Government armed groups against army and security convoys, patrols and facilities. This 
asset has also been used to target members of military and security forces and Government 
officials; causing in many cases collateral damage among civilians and their properties. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Other actors 
</b></p>
<p>16. Several radical Islamic armed groups have emerged in the country. The most 
significant of those is the Al-Nusrah Front for the People of the Levant, an alleged Al 
Qaeda-linked group that has claimed responsibility for several attacks, including suicide 
bombings against Syrian Government forces and officials. The attacks that took place 
throughout the country, including in the cities of Damascus, Aleppo, Deir el-Zour, and 
Idlib, have targeted members of the Government, police, military, intelligence and the 
<i>Shabbiha</i>. The attacks consisted of suicide bombings, ambushes, assassinations, car 
bombings and IED attacks. The group has identified its leader as the Syrian national Sheikh 
Abu Muhammad al Julani. In addition to the Al Nusrah Front, other groups announced as </p>


<p>operating within the country include Syrian Al Baraa Ibn Malik Martyrdom Brigade in 
Homs and the Abdullah Azzam Brigades, a regional al Qaeda affiliate. 
</p>
<p>17. The Commission noted the emergence of self-defence groups in several localities. 
Some of these groups emerged in villages populated by allegedly pro-government 
minorities that are not necessarily part of the <i>Shabbiha</i> militia.  </p>


<p><b>Annex IV 
</b></p>
<p>[<i>English only</i>] 
</p>
<p><b>  Special inquiry into Al-Houla 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Background 
</b></p>
<p>1. Mandated to conduct a special inquiry into the events in Al-Houla of 25 May 2012, 
the commission delivered its preliminary findings to the Human Rights Council on 27 June 
(A/HRC/20/CRP.1), based on the evidence and materials gathered through 22 June.a The 
initial report found the Government responsible for the deaths of civilians as a result of 
shelling Al-Houla area and particularly the Taldou village. It also found that the 
Government had failed to properly conduct an investigation into the events in Al-Houlain 
accordance with international human rights standards. While the commission did not rule 
out the responsibility of other potential perpetrators in the killing of the Abdulrazzak and 
Al-Sayed families,b it concluded that it was unlikely that opposition forces were implicated. 
</p>
<p>2. The commission has since continued its investigation focusing on identifying the 
perpetrators. Access to the country was not granted despite specific requests to the Syrian 
Arab Republic via <i>Note Verbale</i> dated 4 June 2012 (annex XI) and in person by the 
Chairperson during his visit to Damascus 24&#8211;25 June 2012. Moreover, the commission had 
not received a response to a request dated 13 July to interview two specific witnesses whose 
testimony had appeared in the Government report and who had been interviewed by both 
Syrian and Russian journalists (annex XI).c Although the Syrian Government provided the 
preliminary report of its own commission of inquiry on 7 June, it has not delivered a final 
report, nor indicated when such a report might be forthcoming.  
</p>
<p>3. In its continued investigation the commission examined additional satellite imagery 
and interviewed a further eight witnesses, six of which were from the area of Taldou by 
telephone, including two survivors. It gathered several other witness accounts, video 
material and analysis from other sources, always giving due regard to their reliability and 
authenticity.  
</p>
<p>4. As noted, the Government&#8216;s report stated that the Syrian Army had defended itself 
from an attack by what it deemed &#8213;terrorists&#8214;, and that a number of soldiers were killed in 
the clashes. The report acknowledged the deaths of civilians and described the Abdulrazzak 
family as peaceful and stated that it had refused to rise up against the State or participate in 
demonstrations &#8211; suggesting they were attacked by anti-government groups for their failure 
to support the rebellion. The motive provided for the Al-Sayed family killings was their

 a This report is to be read together with the Commission&#8216;s first report, see A/HRC/20/CRP.1, 27 June 
</p>
<p>2012. 
 b The anti-Government activists and many victims and witnesses blamed the killings on Government 
</p>
<p>forces working in concert with <i>Shabbiha</i> from neighbouring villages. The Government in its report 
blamed the 600&#8211;700 &#8213;terrorists&#8214; for the killings. The commission also considered the possibility that 
foreign groups were involved. 
</p>
<p> c On 3 August, the commission received a call from the Geneva Mission of the Syrian Arab Republic 
offering to arrange interviews with the two witnesses. By the deadline for submission of this report 
the interviews had not taken place. </p>


<p>familial ties to Abdelmuti Mashlab, a new member of parliament, and existing feuds with 
some members of the armed groups. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Findings from further investigation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Consistency of accounts 
</b></p>
<p>5. More than forty separate interviews were considered by the commission. All 
interviewees were consistent in their portrayal of the events and their description of the 
perpetrators as Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i>. Apart from the two witnesses in the 
Government report, no other account supported the Government&#8216;s version of events. As 
</p>
<p>noted, the commission&#8216;s request to interview those two witnesses was not fulfilled. The 
</p>
<p>commission, nevertheless, carefully reviewed their testimony as set out in the Government 
report and interviews they gave to other sources, and deemed their accounts to be unreliable 
as they contained a number of inconsistencies.d Not making the witnesses available to the 
commission meant that those inconsistencies could not be further explored. Separately, a 
high-ranking defector that the commission deemed credible reported that, prior to his 
defection, he was asked to help manufacture evidence supporting the Government&#8216;s version 
of events.  
</p>
<p>6. At the same time, accounts of other witnesses interviewed by the commission 
remained consistent over time, including those collected from children, despite the fact that 
they were conducted by different interviewers.e The commission found it highly unlikely 
that the dozens of people interviewed in Taldou could be taking part in an extensive 
fabrication over such an extended period. 
</p>
<p>7. Consequently, the commission found the version of events received from the 
Government to be uncorroborated and insufficient when compared to the larger body of 
evidence collected from other sources. Besides the Government&#8216;s report, little evidence was 
</p>
<p>collected suggesting that anyone other than Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> committed 
the killings.f 
</p>
<p>  
 d As examples: 1. They failed to describe the location of the main incident, specifically the 
</p>
<p>Abdulrazzak family home; 2. The witness purported to know that in the northern part of the town 
&#8213;terrorists&#8214; were distributing ammunition to each other, but elsewhere the witness described her 
presence as being in the centre near the clock tower or further south during the same time frame; 3-. 
The witness also stated that the &#8213;terrorists&#8214; included &#8213;strangers who don&#8216;t belong to our village,&#8214; and 
was able to remember their names individually while the village has 30,000 people, and the whole 
area of Al-Houla&#8216;s population is more than 100,000. It is unclear how she could be so certain of 
terrorist individual identities\names in the described context; 4. The witness said she saw the burning 
at the hospital area &#8213;when we passed by.&#8214; The area around the hospital was in government hands 
throughout, so it is unclear when and how she was able to reach the given location given the 
circumstances of the day; 5. She suggested that the armed groups were in fact mentioning the real first 
names of the groups&#8216; leaders over their radio communications. The commission finds this lacking 
credibility; 6. The witness described the Al-Sayed family as having been shot from across the street 
when all other evidence, including by UNSMIS visiting the scene, indicate the victims died from 
gunshots at close range. 
</p>
<p> e UNSMIS, international human rights NGOs, journalists and the CoI have all conducted interviews 
during the course of their investigations into the events. 
</p>
<p> f The commission examined the version of events reported in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 
(FAZ), 7 June 2012, by Rainer Hermann, and by journalist Marat Musin, on Anna news and Russia 
Today, 2 June 2012, (Available at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyi-tJ_0PPg) both of which 
blamed the killings on anti-Government armed groups. The commission found these reports relied 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p><b> B. Location and access 
</b></p>
<p>8. The commission&#8216;s earlier report determined that both the anti- and pro-Government 
forces could have accessed the two crime scenes &#8211; the first scene being the seven 
Abdulrazzak family homes on Dam Street (<i>Tariq al-Sad</i>) and the second being the two Al-
Sayed family homes on Main Street (<i>Al-</i>Shar&#8223;i Al<i>-Raisi</i>), across the street from the National 
Hospital (see map). The commission has since determined that the checkpoint at <i>Al-Qaws</i> 
remained in Government hands at the end of the day the incident occurred. The checkpoint 
demarcated the new front line between the opposition and Government forces. The 
commission concluded that Al-Sayed house was adjacent to the National Hospital and lying 
south of <i>Al-Qaws</i> checkpoint and that the crime scene remained in Government-controlled 
territory the entire time. Indeed, when UNSMIS arrived the next day and negotiated the 
handover of the bodies from the site (see the report of the Secretary-General to the Security 
Council, S/2012/523, 27 May 2012), Government soldiers were on duty at the checkpoint 
and in control of the crime scene. 
</p>
<p>9. In a related finding, the commission ruled out the theory proffered by the 
Government that the target of the killing was in fact the newly elected Member of 
Parliament from Taldou, Abdelmuti Mashlab. According to the Government report,  
</p>
<p>The first targets of this massacre were relatives of the People&#8223;s Assembly member 
</p>
<p><i>Abd Al-</i>Moa&#8223;ti Mashlab. What was required was to take revenge, because he 
</p>
<p><i>challenged them when he submitted his candidacy to </i>the People&#8223;s Assembly and 
</p>
<p><i>managed to be elected as a member. This indeed happened before things went out of 
</i></p>
<p><i>control and the massacre extended to slaughter other families.</i>g 
</p>
<p>10. The &#8213;other families&#8214; are those of Mashlab&#8216;s distant relatives, namely the Al-Sayed 
family. The commission determined that the Mashlab household was in opposition-
controlled areas of the town at the time of the attack. Thus it would have been accessible to 
an anti-Government armed group seeking to mete out such a punishment, yet the house 
remained untouched. Both Al-Sayed family homes, conversely, were readily accessible to 
Government forces or local militias, but the same access would have been extremely risky 
if not impossible for anti-Government groups.  
</p>
<p>11. At the Abdulrazzak crime scene, where over 60 persons were killed, the commission 
considered it likely that a large number of perpetrators would have been necessary to carry 
out the crime. The killings occurred in broad daylight. Testimony received indicated that 
the perpetrators arrived both by foot and in vehicles, and that some arrived with pickups 
with machine guns mounted on top, in addition to a number of cars and minivans. The 
commission found that the movement of vehicles or weapons, as well as the size of the 
group, would have been detectable by Government forces at the Water Authority position. 
At the same time, access to the scene for any sizable group of anti-Government armed men 
would have been practically impossible, especially if they arrived in vehicles as multiple 
eyewitnesses attested.  
</p>
<p>12. Opposition members did manage to access the scene and remove the bodies later 
that evening and apparently did so using vehicles. However, they were apparently shot at 
by Government forces and had to abandon their efforts until the following morning. 
</p>
<p>  
primarily on the same two witnesses as the Government&#8216;s report and not on additional investigation 
or witnesses in Al-Houla. Moreover, these reports asserted that the Abdulrazzak family had converted 
to Shiism. The commission confirmed that all members of both families were Sunni and that no one 
in either family had converted. 
</p>
<p> g <i>Note Verbale</i>, 281/2012 of 7 June 2012, p.3 (unofficial translation). </p>


<p><b> C. Loyalties 
</b></p>
<p>13. The National Hospital had been occupied by the army for several months prior to the 
incidents. Although it was accessible by foot from both crime scenes, no one &#8212; whether 
injured or fleeing the crime scenes &#8212; sought refuge there. As far as the commission could 
determine, all injured and surviving family members, as well as people from nearby houses, 
fled to opposition-controlled areas. Moreover, as mentioned in the commission&#8216;s previous 
report, it was anti-Government activists who arrived at the area first, took care of the 
deceased and assisted in treating the wounded and organized their burial. The commission 
saw no indication that pro-Government entities attempted to do the same, namely to secure 
the crime scenes or to recover the wounded and deceased after news of the events broke &#8211; 
at either site. 
</p>
<p>14. The Government report depicted the loyalties of the Al-Sayed family as pro-
Government. Muawia Al-Sayed, who was killed alongside his son and young daughter that 
day, was a retired colonel in the security forces. His son Ahmad was still on active duty, but 
had been home on extended sick leave. The commission found it compelling that their 
family members, who survived, fled to opposition-controlled areas of Taldou and chose not 
to seek assistance from the Government forces nearby. From there, they requested that 
UNSMIS facilitate the handing over of the bodies to their location. Moreover, testimonies 
from surviving members of those families clearly describe Government forces and 
<i>Shabbiha</i>, as the perpetrators. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>15. The continued investigation since its preliminary report of 27 June 2012, has 
supplemented the commission&#8216;s initial understanding of the events in Al-Houla. On the 
basis of available evidence, the commission has a reasonable basis to believe that the 
perpetrators of the deliberate killing of civilians, at both the Abdulrazzak and Al-Sayed 
family locations, were aligned to the Government. It rests this conclusion on its 
understanding of access to the crime sites, the loyalties of the victims, the security layout in 
the area including the position of the government&#8216;s water authority checkpoint and the 
</p>
<p>consistent testimonies of victims and witnesses with direct knowledge of the events. This 
conclusion is bolstered by the lack of credible information supporting other possibilities. 
</p>
<p>16. The commission remains of the view that the Government has manifestly failed in 
its obligation to properly investigate the murders that took place in Al-Houla on 25 May 
2012. </p>

<p><b>Annex V 
</b></p>
<p>[<i>English only</i>] 
</p>
<p><b>  Unlawful killing 
</b></p>
<p>1. The commission conducted more than 300 interviews relating to the unlawful killing 
of civilians and <i>hors de combat</i> fighters in more than 30 separate incidents. The bulk of the 
interviews &#8212; 285 &#8212; related to killings perpetrated by Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i>. 
These killings occurred in the contexts set out below. The frequency of such violations has 
increased considerably during the reporting period. Concerning anti-Government armed 
groups, 15 interviewees provided information on the unlawful killing of captured members 
of Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i>. 
</p>
<p>2. Under IHRL Government forces may take the life of a citizen only when doing so is 
both necessary and proportionate.a It is manifestly illegal to kill a person that has been 
arrested or disarmed and thus poses no threat.b When the threshold of armed conflict is 
reached in a country and IHL is in effect, the applicable rules differ to a degree,c but the 
underlying principles remain. Purposefully killing a civiliand or <i>hors de combat</i> fighter,e 
without first affording them a judicial process meeting international standards is a war 
crime. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> 
</b></p>
<p>3. Many forms of unlawful killing took place in the context of attacks against anti-
Government armed group strongholds. The most prominent pattern began with a blockade, 
then shelling, use of snipers, and an assault by ground forces including <i>Shabbiha</i> followed 
by house searches. Defectors, activists or fighting aged men were systematically sought out 
during these operations. Wounded or captured Anti-Government fighters (i.e. <i>hors de 
combat</i>) were executed. In some cases, family members of fighters, defectors and activists 
as well as others who appeared to be randomly selected, were also executed.  
</p>
<p>4. Snipers regularly accompanied attacking forces during ground assaults and were 
responsible for a significant number of the civilian deaths. The commission recorded 35 
instances of civilians shot by sniper fire over the reporting period.f 
</p>
<p>5. The following cases are emblematic of this pattern. Updates on previously reported 
incidents are also included below. 
</p>
<p>  
 a See annex II, paras. 30&#8211;42. 
 b The only exception to this proscription is when the person has been sentenced to death by a lawfully 
</p>
<p>constituted tribunal that provided all fundamental judicial guarantees. 
 c See annex II. 
 d Use of the terms &#8215;civilians&#8216; in this section refers to those not taking direct part in hostilities. See ICRC 
</p>
<p>Study, Rule 6. 
 e Much like in IHRL, the principle of proportionality is in effect during armed conflict. It prohibits the 
</p>
<p>incidental deaths of civilians that are excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military 
advantage anticipated. See annex I (Applicable law). See also ICRC Study, Rule 14. 
</p>
<p> f Dozens of interviewees described the detrimental psychological and social effects of the presences of 
snipers in the neighbourhood. People feared leaving their houses, but when shelling started they 
feared staying home. Routine tasks such as shopping, going to work or playing outside became life 
threatening. </p>


<p><b>  Tremseh (Hama), 12 July 2012 
</b></p>
<p>6. On 12 July 2012, in the early morning, FSA positions in Tremseh came under attack 
by Government forces using shelling, ground troops and helicopter gunships. Prior to the 
offensive, Government forces had cordoned the town with checkpoints. Reports from 
credible sources suggest that <i>Shabbiha</i> deployed together with the army. 
</p>
<p>7. The motive for the assault appears to have been a Government intervention to root 
out armed groups that had been involved in a series of tit-for-tat kidnappings with 
<i>Shabbiha</i>, reportedly from the neighbouring Alawi town of Safsafiah.  
</p>
<p>8. Initial reports indicated that the attack began with cutting supplies of electricity, 
water and mobile-telephone services. Shelling began around 5:00 am. Helicopter gunships 
supported the Government ground forces, which entered the town at 8:00 am. Together they 
inflicted heavy losses on the anti-Government forces.  
</p>
<p>9. Individuals attempting to flee were shot in fields on the outskirts of the town, though 
the commission could not determine whether they were civilians or fighters. The assault 
continued throughout the day, ultimately ending with Government forces retaking control 
of Tremseh. They withdrew around 8:00 pm.  
</p>
<p>10. UNSMIS observers attempting to reach Tremseh on 12 July were stopped outside 
the town by Government forces. When UNSMIS reached the village on 13 July, they 
reported that civilian objects, including over 50 homes and a school, were affected. They 
also observed &#8213;pools of blood and brain matter ... in a number of homes&#8214;. UNSMIS 
</p>
<p>interviewed 27 villagers who gave consistent accounts of extrajudicial executions of men 
arrested by Government forces.  
</p>
<p><i>According to those interviewed, the army was conducting house to house searches 
</i></p>
<p><i>asking for men and their ID cards. They alleged that after checking their 
</i></p>
<p><i>identification, numerous were killed. 
</i></p>
<p>11. Other uncorroborated reports blamed rebels for the civilian deaths in this incident. 
The commission viewed video material purportedly from Tremseh, broadcast on Russian 
television, of two FSA members captured by the army confessing to having killed civilians 
in the town. The commission could not assess whether these confessions were obtained 
voluntarily. 
</p>
<p><b>  Al-Qubeir (Hama), 6 June 2012 
</b></p>
<p>12. Al-Qubeir is a predominantly Sunni village 20 km northwest of Hama. Although 
emptied as a result of fighting at the time of writing, it had consisted of approximately 25 
houses with no more than 150 residents, most of them from the al-Yatim family. The 
commission examined a testimony from an eyewitness (defector), as well as reports from 
other credible sources with direct knowledge of the 6 June events. The Government 
provided the commission with a report of its findings in a <i>Note Verbale</i>, dated 19 June 
2012.g 
</p>
<p>13. The Al-Qubeir area had reportedly been experiencing ethnic tensions since the 
beginning of the conflict.h In the days leading up to the incident a resident of Al-Qubeir had 
</p>
<p>  
 g Regarding the Government&#8216;s report, the commission viewed video material wherein one member of 
</p>
<p>the Government&#8216;s commission who compiled the report on Al-Qubeir was announcing his defection. 
Therein he implied that the judiciary had been co-opted into covering up the misdeeds of Government 
forces and aligned forces. The video could not be authenticated. 
</p>
<p> h A journalist who visited Al-Qubeir shortly after the incident and who interviewed a person who had 
come back to retrieve some items, reported his interviewee as saying, &#8213;Many young men from the 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>an altercation with Alawi members of the neighboring village of Al-Twaime. Anticipating 
reprisal, the villager requested support from members of the FSA, including seven defectors 
from the nearby village of Grejis. According to the Government, when they arrived at the 
village, the FSA elements shot at some of the men in Al-Twaime. The men from Al-
Twaime alerted Government security forces. 
</p>
<p>14. From evidence collected, it appears that after shelling the houses where the anti-
Government forces were holed up, ground forces moved in. They were supported by the 
<i>Shabbiha</i> who also deployed in the area. An eye-witness stated that many people were 
killed and injured in the shelling. The injured were reportedly executed by the <i>Shabbiha</i>, 
and their bodies burned in the houses. Video footage taken during the visit of UNSMIS 
monitors shows bullet holes on an interior wall of a house, accompanied by blood 
splattering, suggestive of deliberate killing. The number of deceased has not been 
confirmed and varies from the Government&#8216;s account of 40, a figure that includes both 
</p>
<p>killed and missing, to 78, a figure put forward by anti-Government activists. Under both 
accounts, at least two women and four children were among those killed. 
</p>
<p>15. In its report the Government described how it deployed to the village with security 
forces in response to a request from villagers seeking protection from &#8213;terrorists&#8214;. It 
</p>
<p>mentioned the use of RPGs and light arms in its assault on Al-Qubeir. According to the 
Government&#8216;s inquiry, initially its forces were repelled and at least one officer was killed, 
</p>
<p>while several more were wounded. Reinforcements were brought in and, according to the 
report, &#8213;shelled also the places where the terrorists were stationed with RPG shells&#8214;. The 
</p>
<p>clash ended on the same day at about 8:00 pm and resulted in the deaths of a number of the 
terrorists&#8214;. According to the report, security forces attacked only the house of Alman Al 
</p>
<p>Yatim where allegedly the &#8213;terrorists&#8214; were located.  
</p>
<p>16. The report also states that the bodies of some women and children were examined 
by a forensic pathologist who determined that they had been killed by gunfire at close range 
prior to the arrival of the security forces in the village &#8211; the implication being that the 
perpetrators were the &#8213;terrorists&#8214;.  
</p>
<p>17. It is likely that many people died as a result of shelling. Some clearly died from 
gunshot wounds. However, some of these individuals may have been directly participating 
in the hostilities, which means targeting them would not be illegal under international law. 
</p>
<p>18. The commission found that a reasonable suspicion exists that unlawful killing of 
civilians or <i>hors de combat</i> fighters occurred at the hands of pro-Government forces, 
including <i>Shabbiha</i> from neighboring villages. This conclusion is based on the following 
factors: the eyewitness account; the Government&#8216;s report and other materials gathered 
</p>
<p>indicating that residents of Al-Qubeir were feuding with their Alawi neighbors, providing a 
motive for reprisals; and the FSA and defectors having been invited to Al-Qubeir by 
villagers seeking their protection.

<p>town of approximately 15,000 inhabitants following an anti-Government demonstration. 
The eyewitnesses described in detail how the security forces entered the town after an 
extensive bout of shelling, arrested two brothers, Moustapha Qarsoum and &#8215;Adil Qarsoum, 
</p>
<p>executed them and then burnt the two bodies. The shelling of Kili resulted in at least eight 
additional civilian deaths. Many houses of perceived opposition collaborators were burned.  
</p>
<p><b>  Tal Rifat (Aleppo), 5 April 2012 
</b></p>
<p>20. The commission conducted 18 interviews with five women and 13 men who had 
knowledge of the events in Tal Rifat on 5 April. During a demonstration that turned violent, 
protestors captured four members of the security forces. The four were held for ransom, 
with their captors threatening to kill them unless the security forces, who had surrounded 
the city, withdrew. The Government forces complied, and the four were released. 
Immediately afterwards, the 4th Division of the Syrian army raided Tal Rifat. The village 
was cordoned in advance. Many of the inhabitants who supported the anti-Government 
armed groups had already fled. One family, the Sakrans, that was openly pro-Government, 
and had a member working in the military security, stayed behind, as did a small number of 
anti-Government fighters.  
</p>
<p>21. At the end of the hostilities at least 52 corpses were discovered, including members 
of the Sakran family who had been burned in their home. At least seven of the anti-
Government fighters who had stayed behind were also found dead. One testimony 
presented evidence suggesting three people had been executed standing against a wall. 
Hundreds of homes were looted and burned, reportedly as punishment for the villagers who 
were accused of having captured the security force personnel and harbouring members of 
anti-Government armed groups. 
</p>
<p><b>  Taftanaz (Idlib), 3</b>&#8211;<b>4 April 2012 
</b></p>
<p>22. The commission conducted 16 interviews with persons having direct knowledge of 
the events of 3 April 2012 in Taftanaz, including fighters and civilians. Interviewees stated 
that the Syrian army launched an intensive attack on the town which had been the scene of 
several anti-Government protests. Multiple reports indicated that shelling from two 
directions commenced at 7:00 am and continued for several hours while tanks formed a 
cordon around the town. As civilians attempted to flee, they came under attack by 
helicopter gunships. The commission recorded at least six civilian casualties resulting from 
the shelling and gunship attacks. At the time, many men from the town reportedly took up 
arms and engaged the Syrian army in battle, slowing their progress into Taftanaz. The 
commission received reports of tanks being destroyed by anti-Government forces, the latter 
of which were using mosque loudspeakers to direct and motivate their fighters. Two 
mosques were allegedly destroyed by the Syrian army. 
</p>
<p>23. In the early hours of 4 April 2012, anti-Government forces reportedly made a 
tactical withdrawal from Taftanaz, leaving the way free for Government forces together 
with <i>Shabbiha</i> to enter Taftanaz and to conduct house searches. The commission recorded 
multiple executions occurring during these searches. In one case, the bodies of two adults 
and five young children were found burnt in a house. Some bodies were reportedly found 
with gunshot wounds to the head and chest. Some of those bodies were also found 
blindfolded with hands tied behind their backs. Casualty estimates range from 84 to 110 
people, many of them from the extended Ghazal family. Over 500 houses were reportedly 
looted and then burnt. According to reports received between 30 and 40 people are missing, 
presumed to have been arrested and detained by the Government forces during the raids. </p>


<p><b>  Sarmin (Idlib), 22</b>&#8211;<b>23 March 2012 
</b></p>
<p>24. According to six witnesses, the army began shelling the town of Sarmin in the early 
hours of 22 March 2012. Sarmin had been the scene of anti-Government protests and the 
base of dozens of defectors and other members of anti-Government armed groups. Most of 
the civilian population and members of anti-Government armed groups fled before the 
attack. During the shelling, which, according to witnesses was falling in random locations, 
18 people were killed. The army entered Sarmin on 23 March 2012 and, in line with 
established practice, commenced house searches. Snipers were positioned on rooftops. The 
commission received reports of men being shot either during searches or while on the 
street. In one corroborated account, three men, all in their 20s, were taken outside during a 
house search and shot in the front-yard in the presence of their families. The victims were 
family members of a well-known lieutenant from the 15th Division Special Forces who had 
defected. Reports from credible sources describe approximately 300 people arrested during 
the search operation, of which 10 were killed shortly afterwards. Some were later released; 
others were reportedly still held at the time of writing. 
</p>
<p><b>  Ain Larouz (Idlib), 4</b>&#8211;<b>12 March 2012 
</b></p>
<p>25. On 4 March 2012, four officers defected from an army base in Aranba and hid in the 
nearby village of Ain Larouz. Shortly after sunset, military and security forces raided the 
village looking for the four defectors. They searched houses, burned shops and vehicles and 
mistreated residents. They detained approximately 35 persons, including two women and a 
10-year-old girl. Security forces were reported to have announced over the mosque 
loudspeakers a warning with a deadline for the people to hand over the defectors or else 
they would execute the captives and burn down the village. Following the threats most 
villagers fled.  
</p>
<p>26. Five days later, on 9 March, the army blockaded the roads and began to shell the 
village after positioning snipers on rooftops. According to four witnesses, several persons 
who tried to flee were shot, either by snipers or by pursuing ground forces. Although the 
defecting officers were not found, the army released most captives three days later, save for 
four persons - believed to be relatives of the officers &#8211; whose bodies were found outside the 
city a few days later.  
</p>
<p><b>  Yabroud (Rif Dimashq), 4 March 2012 
</b></p>
<p>27. A defector recalled how, on 4 March, he deployed to Yabroud village to take part in 
an operation. Upon arrival, he joined a battalion of tanks and six buses of security and 
<i>Shabbiha</i> elements. He and the others were ordered to raid the village after it was shelled. 
An informer accompanied them in the village and pointed out the houses of activists and 
defectors. 
</p>
<p>28. A group of people had fled towards a neighbouring mountainous area, but were still 
visible to the soldiers. The commanding officer, after consulting his superiors, went back 
inside a tank and fired a round at the group of approximately 60 people, apparently killing 
dozens. The commission could not verify the profile of this group, which may have 
included members of anti-Government armed groups. 
</p>
<p><b>  Atarib (Aleppo), February</b>&#8211;<b>April 2012 
</b></p>
<p>29. The commission conducted 17 interviews with persons with direct knowledge of the 
events in Atarib in February and in April 2012. The town had been the scene of several 
anti-Government protests. In the early afternoon of 14 February 2012, Government forces 
and FSA fighters clashed in Jabal Karmin, three kilometres from Atarib. On the evening of 
the same day, Government forces attacked Atarib. The town was reportedly shelled by </p>


<p>tanks located on its perimeter, resulting in the death of eight people. Ground forces are said 
to have entered the town, positioning snipers on the rooftops of public buildings, including 
at least one school. The commission received multiple, consistent reports of civilians, in 
particular children, being shot and killed by sniper fire in February during those events, but 
also in March and April 2012.  
</p>
<p><b>  Homs, Feb</b>&#8211;<b>May 2012

<p>30. Government forces launched a large-scale military attack on the neighbourhood of 
Bab Amr in Homs city on 2 February 2012, using mortar shells, missiles and tank shells. 
Although Bab Amr had been targeted on previous occasions, the sustained intensity of this 
attack was unprecedented. The neighbourhood was considered a hotbed of anti-Government 
armed groups, particularly the FSA, which had a strong presence there until 2 March, the 
date on which Government forces reclaimed control of the neighbourhood after 27 days of 
sustained shelling.  
</p>
<p>31. During the same period the FSA engaged in limited skirmishes with Government 
forces on the outskirts of Bab Amr, especially in the nearby Insha&#8216;at neighbourhood. 
Despite its lesser military capacities, the FSA was able to push Government forces back in 
some of the areas.  
</p>
<p>32. Government forces deployed to most access points in the area, thus severely 
restricting movement. At the time of writing, Bab Amr remained under the control of 
Government forces and was suffering a shortage of food and medical care. Much of the 
population fled the neighbourhood to surrounding villages and other neighbourhoods, 
including Khaldieh, Shammas and Al Ghouta, during the intense shelling periods 
throughout February 2012. 
</p>
<p>33. The commission recorded a high incidence of extra-judicial executions of civilians 
in various neighborhoods of the city of Homs since March 2012. Multiple accounts were 
received of the killing of the entire Sabbouh family in Bab Amr on 5 March. On 11 and 12 
March 2012, the neighbourhood of Karm al-Zeytoun reportedly came under an attack by 
what was described as <i>Shabbiha</i> protected by the army. Multiple families were killed in 
their homes, apparently by knives or other sharp instruments. Estimates of casualties, 
unverified by the commission, ranged from 35 to 80 in that attack. 
</p>
<p>34. The commission found that <i>hors de combat</i> fighters were similarly killed. One man 
interviewed by the commission stated that he assisted in the burial of 15 bodies of fighting 
aged men that appeared to have been executed. Syrian security forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> 
reportedly removed adult men from houses in the neighbourhood of Sultaniya, before lining 
them up and shooting them.  
</p>
<p>35. Multiple, consistent reports have been received about extra-judicial executions of 
civilians in the Shammas neighbourhood in Homs on 15 May 2012. Shammas is 
approximately three kilometres from the Baba Amr neighbourhood. Residents describe 
members of the security forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> entering the area and shooting into the air 
before commencing house searches. One of those interviewed explained that the building 
opposite her house was abandoned and that security had broken in, transforming it into a 
&#8213;slaughter house&#8214;. She described how approximately every 15 minutes security forces 
would bring in a man handcuffed and blindfolded and that she would hear a shot shortly 
afterwards. The first man that was shot was dumped in the street. Another interviewee 
indicated that the following day he found 23 bodies, including the local imam, in a building 
near the mosque. Most had bullet wounds to the head. 
</p>
<p>36. Civilians were also killed, reportedly by sniper fire, in Homs, especially in the 
neighborhood of Bab Amr and Khaldiya, in March and April 2012. In these cases the </p>


<p>commission documented that the bodies of people killed by snipers were often left where 
they fell, as no one risked retrieving them.i 
</p>
<p><b>  Al-Qusayr (Homs), Feb 2012</b>j<b> 
</b></p>
<p>37. Four interviewees described the city of Al-Qusayr being pinned down under sniper 
fire in February 2012. One male resident interviewed by the commission was hit on his way 
back from taking his wife and daughter to the doctor. He had stopped along the road to help 
some people to restart their car and was hit from behind. The bullet hit a nerve paralysing 
his left leg. 
</p>
<p><b>  Abdita (Idlib), 21 February 2012 
</b></p>
<p>38. Four women and 17 men having direct knowledge of the events in Abdita on 21 
February 2012 were interviewed by the commission. Their testimonies described in detail 
the army&#8216;s blockade of the entrances to the village that day and how they conducted house 
</p>
<p>searches, apparently looking for persons implicated in an IED attack. In one well-
documented instance, the army entered the house known for hosting FSA members, took 
the men out to a neighbouring field, asked them about the IED and shot them when they did 
not receive an adequate response. One of the three survived and was interviewed by the 
commission. Another eyewitness stated that 15 persons, out of a total of 30 who died in the 
clashes that day, died from wounds that suggested execution. Relatives of the FSA leader 
Riad al-Assad, who is originally from Abdita, were apparently among those summarily 
executed. 
</p>
<p><b>  Legal conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>39. The commission finds that the individual instances of killing described above 
provide reasonable grounds to believe that Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> violated IHRL 
provisions protecting the right to life. Furthermore, many of the same killings met the 
definitional requirements of the war crime of murder.k 
</p>
<p>40. Additionally, the evidence indicated that many attacks were directed against 
civilians and civilian objects.l Although the Government&#8216;s stated aim was to attack 
&#8213;terrorists&#8214;, the attacks were directed at neighborhoods, towns and regions with civilian 
populations. The commission therefore concludes that there are reasonable grounds to 
believe that the war crime of attacking civilians has been perpetrated in many instances. 
</p>
<p>41. There are reasonable grounds to believe that the documented incidents also 
constituted the crime against humanity of murder. In those towns and villages where there 
was a pattern of blockade, shelling, ground assault and house-to-house searches, the 
element of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population was met. The 
scale of the attacks, their repetitive nature, the level of excessive force consistently used, 
the indiscriminate nature of the shelling and the coordinated nature of the attacks led the 
commission to conclude that they were conducted pursuant to State policy.

 l See ICRC Customary IHL Study, Rule 1. Rome statute, Art. 8 (2) (e) (i). </p>


<p><b> II. Anti-Government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>42. The commission documented instances of anti-Government forces killing captured 
members of the Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> and suspected informers. While the 
human rights legal regime differs with respect to non-state actors such as the anti-
Government armed groups, IHL applies equally to all parties in a conflict. Thus, killing 
protected persons or enemy soldiers who are <i>hors de combat</i> is illegal and can attract 
individual criminal responsibility.m  
</p>
<p>43. Members of anti-Government armed groups have admitted killing Government 
soldiers after capture when the captives refused to join them or if they were deemed to have 
&#8213;blood on their hands&#8214;. The commission documented incidents involving anti-Government 
armed groups &#8212; specifically the FSA &#8212; primarily in Homs, including the Bab Amr and 
Khaldiyah neighborhoods during the February 2012 siege, and in Al-Qusayr in June 2012.  
</p>
<p>44. Despite its limited access to victims of anti-Government armed groups, the 
commission documented anti-Government fighters having killed captured Government 
soldiers and <i>Shabbiha</i> who had admitted, probably under duress, to taking part in shelling 
or military attacks. 
</p>
<p><b>  Homs Governorate, June 2012 
</b></p>
<p>45. In Qusayr, the FSA commanders decided to attack the municipality to dislodge 
Government snipers. The attack succeeded and the FSA captured 22 Government soldiers. 
One interviewee told the CoI that the detainees were judged by a judicial committee. Some 
were released to join their families. Some were executed as they were found guilty.  
</p>
<p>46. In early June 2012, FSA fighters attacked a garrison near Talbisah. Apparently in 
coordination with Government forces soldiers inside, the FSA overran the location, took the 
ammunition and weapons and left with a number of defecting soldiers. According to an 
eyewitness who was in the army at the time, but who later defected, two Alawite soldiers 
were executed during the raid. He and others found their bodies inside.  
</p>
<p>47. A defector who fought in the ranks of the FSA-affiliated Al Farouk Brigade in Homs 
city stated that members of the Government forces, including those he claimed were three 
Iranian snipers, were summarily executed after they apparently confessed to killing Syrians. 
</p>
<p><b>  Aleppo governorate, June 2012 
</b></p>
<p>48. The commission viewed video footage that portrayed the bodies of approximately 20 
men, allegedly <i>Shabbiha</i>, who had been killed by the anti-Government fighters in Aleppo 
governorate in mid-June. 
</p>
<p>49. The commission interviewed 10 FSA soldiers who had never heard of IHL or IHRL. 
One FSA fighter told the commission: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not leave them alone until we kill them. Either they finish us or we finish 
</p>
<p><i>them. We do not let them go and continue to kill people. We do not take prisoners, 
</i></p>
<p><i>no on</i>e comes out alive. If he manages to escape he will come back to kill me.&#8221; </p>
<p>50. Another FSA fighter interviewed stated that when senior military officers are 
captured they are exchanged for detained members of anti-Government armed groups. 
However, if the FSA captures an ordinary officer or soldier, &#8213;they are interrogated and 
submitted to trial where Sharia law is applied&#8214;. The interviewee provided information on 
</p>
<p>  
 m See annex II. </p>


<p>the composition and functioning of such a court in Tal Rifat. Its members are apparently 
educated and from diverse backgrounds. For example, some are lawyers, religious leaders 
and others known for their integrity. The soldier had never heard of IHL and related his 
view that, &#8213;[IHL] is not better than Sharia law where everyone is punished for what he has 
done by the same means, an eye for an eye&#8214;.  
</p>
<p>51. The commission has taken note of an increased use of IEDs by anti-Government 
armed groups. Interviewees described how, in April 2012, they had put nails inside pipes 
with explosive powder and a fuse. Others described the use of gas and fertilizer to create 
homemade bombs. Information provided by the Government, but not corroborated by the 
commission, indicated that some 1149 explosive devices have exploded or were dismantled 
during between May and July 2012. 
</p>
<p><b>  Legal conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>52. The commission considered the corroborated evidence of killing <i>hors de combat</i> 
Government soldiers and <i>Shabbiha</i>. In Qusayr, Bab Amr, Kaldiyeh and elsewhere the 
commission noted that persons captured by the FSA on occasion faced a quasi-judicial 
process prior to their execution. A consistent account of the trial process has not been 
forthcoming, nor has information on the extent of adherence to fair trial standards. 
Common Article three of the Geneva Conventions, recognized as customary IHL, prohibits 
such executions unless the accused has been afforded &#8213;all the judicial guarantees which are 
</p>
<p>recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples&#8214; These guarantees include, inter alia, the 
</p>
<p>presumption of innocence, an impartial tribunal, the ability to mount a defense and examine 
opposing witnesses, and especially in capital cases, the ability to appeal the judgment. 
Executing a prisoner without affording fundamental judicial guarantees is a war crime. 
</p>
<p>53. The commission concluded that the information in its possession on executions 
perpetrated by anti-Government armed groups &#8212; with or without a &#8213;trial&#8214; &#8212; gave rise to 
reasonable grounds to believe that the war crime of murder had been committed on multiple 
occasions. The commission could not corroborate alleged attacks directed against 
individual civilians not participating in hostilities or against a civilian population.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Unknown perpetrators 
</b></p>
<p>54. The commission noted four incidents where attacks were committed by as yet 
unknown perpetrators. They are as follows: 
</p>
<p>(i) In the period leading up to this report, a series of attacks, primarily gunfire, 
was directed at UN observers&#8216; convoys. On 12 June 2012, a convoy headed to Al-
Haffe was stopped by alleged pro-Government protestors and was later fired upon 
by unknown gunmen. On 16 June 2012, UNSMIS stopped its patrols due to safety 
concerns; 
</p>
<p>(ii) Thirteen factory workers were killed on 31 May 2012 near the village of al-
Buwaida al-Sharqiya, between Qusayr and the city of Homs. The men were 
allegedly taken by <i>Shabbiha</i>, who arrested, robbed and then killed them. A female 
eyewitness was with them, but was set free; 
</p>
<p>(iii) UNSMIS confirmed on 30 May 2012 the discovery of 13 men&#8216;s bodies near 
the eastern city of Deir el-Zour. Their hands were tied behind their backs, and some 
were shot in the head. The bodies were discovered by locals in the area of Assukar, 
50km east of Deir el-Zour; </p>


<p>iv. Journalists from Ikhbariya TV were reportedly killed in an attack on their 
premises in the town of Drousha south of Damascus on 27 June 2012. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Explosions 
</b></p>
<p>55. Between March and July 2012, there have been a series of large explosions in which 
scores of civilians were killed. The explosions appear to be by suicide bombers or by 
explosives hidden in vehicles and detonated remotely. The commission has compiled the 
list below based on open sources it deems credible and where the information is consistent 
with other material on hand, including interviews conducted by the commission: 
</p>
<p>(i) 18 July 2012, bombing at Syria&#8216;s national security building in Damascus 
killed the Minister of Defense and other senior Government security officials;  
</p>
<p>(ii) 30 June 2012, a car Bomb targeted a funeral procession in Zamalka, 
Damascus;  
</p>
<p>(iii) 14 June 2012, a car bomb exploded near the Sayyidah Zaynab shrine in a 
Damascus suburb injuring 11 people;  
</p>
<p>(iv) 19 May 2012, a car bomb exploded in the parking lot of a military compound 
in Deir el-Zour; 
</p>
<p>(v) 10 May 2012, two large car bombs exploded near the Military Intelligence 
branch in Damascus&#8216; Qazaz neighborhood killing 55 people; 
</p>
<p>(vi) 30 April 2012, twin explosions near daybreak close to a government 
compound in the city of Idlib killed 20 people, most of them from the security 
services; 
</p>
<p>(vii) 27 April 2012, a bomb near a mosque of Al-Meidan neighborhood of 
Damascus killed 11 people; 
</p>
<p>(viii) 18 March 2012, a car bomb killed three people in Aleppo; and 
</p>
<p>(ix) 17 March 2012, two bombs apparently aimed at an intelligence service office 
and a police headquarters killed 27 people in Damascus. 
</p>
<p><b>  Legal conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>56. While these acts may be linked to the non-international armed conflict and thus 
assessed under the applicable IHL rubric, lack of access to the crime scenes combined with 
an absence of information on the perpetrators hampered the commission&#8216;s ability to render 
such an assessment. They are nevertheless domestic crimes prosecutable under the Syrian 
criminal code. The Government is obliged to ensure an investigation is conducted 
impartially, promptly, effectively and independently in line with its international human 
rights obligations. </p>


<p><b>Annex VI 
</b></p>
<p>[<i>English only</i>] 
</p>
<p><b>  Indiscriminate attacks</b>a<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Homs Governorate 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Bab Amr neighbourhood, February</b>&#8211;<b>May 2012  
</b></p>
<p>1. The majority of deaths in Bab Amr during the military operation that began in 
February 2012 was caused by extensive and indiscriminate shelling by Government forces 
on primarily civilian infrastructure and residential areas. Targets affected by the shelling 
included schools, state hospitals, field hospitals, shops, mosques, houses and apartment 
buildings, and storage facilities. While the FSA was active in the neighbourhood, either 
through military activity or relief efforts, shelling was the primary cause of death and injury 
among children, women and elderly.  
</p>
<p>2. Most of the shelling was indiscriminate, even though in some of the cases it seemed 
to target specific locations. On 22 February 2012, at least two shells struck on the Bab Amr 
Media office, killing many of its occupants, including two foreign journalists. In another 
incident in early February a number of shells fell on the only operational field hospital in 
Bab Amr, causing the death of many of the patients and medical staff. An intense period of 
shelling caused significant destruction to the neighbourhood infrastructure and forced the 
residents to flee.  
</p>
<p><b>  Al Qusayr, February</b>&#8211;<b>July 2012 
</b></p>
<p>3. The city of Al-Qusayr is located a few kilometres southwest of Homs city in a 
mountainous region along the Syrian-Lebanese border, in the Western part of the country. 
Its strategic relevance derives from its location, as well as the demographic makeup of its 
citizenry which consists of a majority of Sunni Muslims, 10 percent Christians and a few 
hundred Alawites.  
</p>
<p>4. Large numbers of its residents have joined the anti-Government protests which have 
spread across the country since February 2011. Al-Qusayr has been theatre to some of the 
heaviest clashes between the Government forces on the one hand, and the FSA and other 
anti-Government armed groups on the other. The city was initially placed under blockade 
by the Syrian army in November 2011. The period since has been continuously marred by 
varied measures of violence which persist at the time of writing. 
</p>
<p>5. Since February 2012, Al-Qusayr experienced heavy armed confrontations between 
Government forces and anti-Government armed groups for the control of the city &#8211; 
particularly for the control of the Municipality building, which was used by Government 
forces as a base to launch attacks in the city, the market area and the main hospital.  
</p>
<p>6. The commission interviewed 10 persons who provided accounts of alleged crimes 
committed in Al-Qusayr. Information gathered by first-hand witnesses indicate that the city 
came under heavy shelling during the period mid-February to mid-July 2012, with peaks in 
late March&#8211;early April 2012 and the first two weeks of June 2012.  
</p>
<p>  
 a See annex II, paras. 30&#8211;42. </p>


<p>7. Witnesses have alleged that in early to mid-June 2012, the army in conjunction with 
security forces and pro-Government militias went on an offensive, indiscriminately 
attacking civilians and fighters alike in most of Al-Qusayr, particularly Arjoun, Abu Huri, 
Baasatin and generally West Qusayr. Accounts show that the Syrian forces resorted to a 
range of weapons, including missiles, shells and rifle grenades, striking residential areas 
and resulting in the loss of life and heavy injury. They also caused damage to private homes 
and public infrastructure.  
</p>
<p>8. In early May after visiting Al-Qusayr, a credible source told the commission, &#8213;<i>I 
witnessed what people generally call random shelling </i>&#8211;<i> the Syrian army just spreads 
</i></p>
<p>mortar fire across an entire neighbourhood. It&#8223;s sometimes preventive while they put up 
</p>
<p>checkpoints. While we were there we were shelled from relatively close in, and it wasn&#8223;t 
</p>
<p><i>their heaviest ammunition. Plus there were a few rocket attacks, mortar and tanks.</i>&#8214; 
</p>
<p>9. Several witnesses &#8212; including children and women &#8212; suffered from shrapnel 
wounds as a result of shells exploding within a few meters&#8216; range. The majority of 
</p>
<p>witnesses who suffered serious injuries as a result of the shelling were civilians at home or 
in the streets. Several people suffered gunshot wounds at the hands of snipers positioned on 
top of buildings in Baasatin and West Qusayr.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Hama Governorate 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Tremseh, 12 July 2012  
</b></p>
<p>10.  Shelling in Tremseh was at times aimed at specific military objectives, while at 
other times appeared indiscriminate. UNSMIS reported that Government forces appeared to 
be targeting fighters and activists with their weaponry. However the same report stated that, 
&#8213;a doctor and his children were killed when a mortar shell hit their home&#8214;.b 
</p>
<p><b> III. Latakya Governorate 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Salma, 11 June 2012 
</b></p>
<p>11.  Salma is located on a strategically important road towards the border on Turkey. 
Anti-Government fighters repelled an attack by Government forces on 11 June. Thereafter, 
the Syrian army repeatedly shelled the village, using helicopter gunships, mortars and 
artillery. Reports suggested that the shelling did not target specific locations harboring FSA 
fighters, but was indiscriminate. 
</p>
<p><b>  Al Haffe, 4</b>&#8211;<b>12 June 2012 
</b></p>
<p>12. On 5 June 2012 Government forces began an assault on the town of Al-Haffe, 
Latakya governorate. Prior to the offensive, the town experienced an escalation of anti-
government protests and was home to a small but increasing number of defectors. There 
was a protest on 4 July which, although non-violent, was clearly calling for the ouster of the 
Assad Government. 
</p>
<p>13. Al-Haffe town, whose population of 10,000 is primarily Sunni, is surrounded by 
Alawi villages. The FSA had a presence in the area numbering as many as 600, apparently 
based in the nearby village of Dofeel. Government police and military intelligence are 
normally present in the village and were there at the time of the assault.  
</p>
<p>  
 b See annex V for more details on the events in Tremseh on 12 July. </p>


<p>14. The commission conducted over 30 interviews with persons who fled the fighting in 
Al-Haffe. Many of these interviews were with people who had just been injured and 
evacuated. They described in detail what had been the pattern during several such 
offensives. 
</p>
<p>15. Attacks began with cordoning off and then shelling, first the village of Dofeel and 
then later Al-Haffe itself. Both tanks and helicopter gunships were involved. The security 
forces present in Al-Haffe placed snipers on top of several buildings. Consistent reports 
stated that shooting was also coming from neighbouring villages, although the commission 
could not determine whether this was from Government or local militias.  
</p>
<p>16. While the target was likely FSA positions in both areas, the shells randomly struck 
civilian objects such as homes, schools and mosques. Civilians were confined in their 
houses, while electricity and water were cut off and food supplies dwindled. At least eight 
civilians, including three children, were killed when a shell hit their home. Several other 
houses were destroyed.  
</p>
<p>17. Injured residents were unable to seek medical treatment at the State hospital on the 
outskirts of Al-Haffe which was occupied by Government forces who positioned snipers on 
the roof. A field clinic was set up, and according to medical personnel working there, the 
majority of the casualties &#8212; including both killed and injured &#8212; was fighting age men. 
Still, there were women and children brought to the hospital who had injuries caused both 
from shelling and from machine gun or sniper fire.  
</p>
<p>18. The FSA apparently held off the initial assault, inflicting heavy losses on the 
Government forces. One eyewitness &#8212; an FSA fighter &#8212; reported seeing Government 
ground forces entering the village in the early afternoon on 5 June who were forced to 
retreat after encountering stiff resistance. This led to increased shelling and attacks from 
helicopters.  
</p>
<p>19. Around 16:00 on 5 June the FSA surrounded the Finance building from which 
military security forces had been firing. After an intense battle, the FSA overran the 
building, allegedly capturing several Government officers. The latter were reportedly set 
free, although the commission was unable to verify the assertion. 
</p>
<p>20. Over the course of the following eight days, fighting continued in and around Al-
Haffe. The FSA ultimately withdrew after evacuating nearly all the remaining civilian 
population. According to numerous corroborated accounts, the army together with 
<i>Shabbiha</i> entered the village on 13 June. Eyewitness accounts portrayed a campaign of 
burning and pillaging of the houses of suspected anti-Government supporters. UNSMIS 
observers, who were allowed into the town only on 15 July, noted that many public 
buildings were looted and burned.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Other incidents documented 
</b></p>
<p>21. Additional corroborated accounts of indiscriminate shelling were recorded in Atarib 
(Aleppo) 14 February; Ain Larouz (Idlib) 5 March; Sermin (Idlib) 22 March; Taftanaz 
(Idlib) 4 April; Kili (Idlib) 6 April; Al-Houla (Homs) 25 May, and 12 and 13 June; Al- 
Haffe (Latakya) 4 and 5 June 2012; Akko (Hama) 9 June; Salma (Latakya) 11 June; and 
Jobar (Idlib) multiple dates in late June. 
</p>
<p>22. The commission also reviewed videos of shelling in the following locations which 
appeared to be indiscriminate, although neither the authenticity of the videos nor the target 
of the attack could be verified: Talbiseh, 17 June; Zafarana, 21 June; Lajat (Dar&#8216;a), 25 June; 
Jalama, 12 July; Abaled, 17 July; and Hayam, 21 July.  </p>


<p><b> V. Cluster munitions 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Commission took note of video evidence emanating from Hama governorate in 
July 2012 indicating the use of cluster munitions. The photographs and video of bomblets 
could not be corroborated. The use of anti-personnel mortar munitions was recorded in 
Zabadani, Damascus governorate, on 12 April. Corroborated accounts described the shells 
exploding just above ground to maximize human casualties. Although the Syrian Arab 
Republic is not a party to the Convention on Cluster Munitions, the commission notes that 
such weapons are inherently indiscriminate when employed in residential areas or areas 
frequented by civilians. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Legal conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>24. Based on its findings the commission determined that the legal threshold for 
indiscriminate attack as a violation of customary IHL has been met. Government forces 
fired shells into areas inhabited by civilians while failing to direct them at a specific 
military objective. 
</p>
<p>25. Moreover, the attacks, especially shelling, caused incidental loss of civilian life and 
injury to civilians, as well as damage to civilian objects, which in the view of the 
commission were excessive when compared to the anticipated military advantage. 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p><b>Annex VII 
</b></p>
<p>[<i>English only</i>] 
</p>
<p><b>  Arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance 
</b></p>
<p>1. The commission continued to receive first-hand accounts of arbitrary arrest and 
detention, predominantly of men and boys. During this reporting period, 25 people were 
interviewed who alleged that they had been arbitrarily arrested and unlawfully detained by 
Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i>. A further five interviews were conducted with defectors 
who stated that, while in active service, they had observed arbitrary arrests and detentions. 
</p>
<p>2. According to information received from the Government, over 10,000 people have 
been released since February 2011, pursuant to four amnesties, including 275 detainees 
released on 10 July 2012. The Report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of 
Security Council resolution 2043 (2012), noted that UNSMIS had observed the release of 
183 detainees in Dar&#8216;a and Damascus on 31 May 2012, and 285 detainees in Damascus, 
</p>
<p>Dar&#8216;a, Hama, Idlib and Deir el-Zour on 14 June 2012.  
</p>
<p>3. Official statistics on the number of detainees as well as the number of detention 
centres have yet to be provided by the Government. The Commission noted that, as of 25 
June 2012, UNSMIS had received and cross-checked information on 2,185 detainees and 
97 places of detention across the Syrian Arab Republic. Syrian NGOs have put the number 
of those currently detained as high as 26,000.  
</p>
<p>4. Given the current lack of access to the country, the commission is not able to 
independently confirm numbers of those arrested and detained during the reporting period. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Findings 
</b></p>
<p>5. The majority of arrests occurred in four contexts: arrests of those believed to be 
planning to defect or who had otherwise refused to follow orders (usually to open fire on 
civilians); arrests of persons in house searches; arrests of persons at checkpoints; and arrests 
of protesters, either at or immediately subsequent to the protests. A minority of cases were 
reported where people were arrested randomly in the street in areas where there were no 
active hostilities at the time. Four of those so arrested and detained were women. Two were 
children, a boy of 14 and a girl of nine.  
</p>
<p>6. Eight of those interviewed were members of the Government forces at the time of 
arrest. Six of these stated that they had been arrested on suspicion of planning to defect. 
Two others stated their arrests had been a consequence of their refusing orders to fire on 
civilians in Idlib (February 2012) and in Homs (May 2012) respectively. Of those arrested 
on suspicion of planning to defect, one stated that he had been found to be in contact with 
anti-Government armed groups. Most, stated that they were not informed of the basis for 
the suspicions. One noted that he had been arrested as part of a mass arrest of 60 Sunni 
soldiers in Aleppo in April 2012. Three of those arrested were detained for over two 
months with one moved among eight different detention facilities. 
</p>
<p>7. According to testimonies received, arrests made during house searches, were 
conducted by military and security forces. The commission received corroborated accounts 
of arrests taking places during house searches in the towns of Ibdita (Idlib) in February 
2012 and of Ar-Rastan (Homs) in March 2012. House searches appeared to target specific 
wanted persons. As described in multiple interviews, individuals were sought because of </p>


<p>their defections from the Government forces or their involvement in protests. Also targeted 
were doctors who had treated protesters or members of the anti-Government armed groups. 
In at least three instances where the wanted individual could not be located, security forces 
arrested and detained members of his or her family instead. Two interviewees reported 
having been arrested and detained on multiple occasions. In three cases, interviewees stated 
that they had been initially held in temporary detention centres &#8212; in one case, a former 
fitness centre in Ar-Rastan &#8212; before being either released or moved to official detention 
centres. 
</p>
<p>8. Individuals were also reportedly arrested, and in one case detained, at checkpoints in 
Homs, Al Ladhiqiyah, Idlib, Aleppo, Dar&#8216;a and Damacus governorates. Lists of wanted 
</p>
<p>persons were allegedly circulated to checkpoints. Those arrested at checkpoints stated that 
they were targeted either for being defectors or for having organised or taken part in 
protests. In one instance, which could not be verified, an interviewee reported being 
arrested and detained in Tartus in March 2012 as injuries that he had suffered during a 
previous detention were viewed by Government forces as evidence of involvement in 
fighting. 
</p>
<p>9. Reports continue to be received of people being arrested &#8212; by security forces and 
<i>Shabbiha</i> &#8212; during and immediately following protests. According to interviews, arrests 
took place following protests in the cities of Idlib in March and April 2012, and Dar&#8216;a and 
Damascus in April 2012. One interviewee, a 14-year-old boy, stated that he and several 
other adolescents were arrested after a protest in Idlib city in March 2012. The commission 
was unable to verify this account, but notes that another interviewee, who worked in a 
detention centre in Damascus until June 2012, reported that minors were arrested and 
detained following protests. 
</p>
<p>10. A number of others interviewed were arrested in the street in areas where there were 
no active hostilities at the time. Those arrested reportedly included five females, including a 
nine year old girl. Additionally, a young man was allegedly arrested in Aleppo in April 
2012, having been found carrying a large amount of foreign currency, which was viewed as 
evidence of support to anti-Government armed groups. None of those arrested in these 
circumstances were taken to official detention centres, but instead were reportedly held in 
unofficial centres, set up in buildings close to their place of arrest. None of these incidents 
could be verified. 
</p>
<p>12. Only two of those interviewed, both arrested on suspicion of planning to defect, had 
been formally charged with any offence. No interviewee had been offered or received the 
benefit of legal counsel. Only one had received a family visit, with the majority unsure if 
their family were aware of the location of their detention.  
</p>
<p>13. In the days prior to release, many said that they had been made to sign or thumbprint 
a document, the contents of which were unknown to them. Three of those detained were 
reportedly brought before a judge and then released. In one unverified incident, the 
interviewee reported that the judge had ordered his release, but he had remained in 
detention for another 3 months. Also interviewed was a former member of the judiciary 
who indicated that security agencies brought to his court detainees who showed signs of 
abuse, including open wounds. He said that security agents did not permit questioning 
unless they were present and, on one occasion, held the judge at gunpoint. Several detainees 
stated that the judges did not question them about their injuries and that the presence of 
security units in the courtroom intimidated them. 
</p>
<p>14. The lengths of detention of those interviewed ranged from a few hours to 
approximately 5 months. The majority of those interviewed were held for 60 days or less by 
Government forces. </p>


<p><b> II. Legal conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>15. The commission considers that Syria&#8216;s domestic legislation fails to meet the 
country&#8216;s obligations under Article 9 of the ICCPR to ensure that those arrested and 
</p>
<p>detained on criminal charges appear &#8213;promptly before a judge or other officer authorized by 
</p>
<p>law to exercise judicial power&#8214;. 
</p>
<p>16. There are reasonable grounds to believe that Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> have 
continued to arbitrarily arrest and detain individuals during this reporting period. Particular 
concerns are the holding of individuals without charge; the failure to provide detainees with 
legal counsel or family visits and the absence in the vast majority of cases reported of any 
form of judicial review of the detentions.  
</p>
<p>17. With respect to the crime of enforced disappearance, the families of those arrested 
were not informed, at the time of arrest or at any point thereafter, of the places of detention 
of their relatives. With the exception of one detainee, no other detainees interviewed had 
been afforded family visits.  
</p>
<p>18. The majority of the families of those detained have not, according to their 
testimonies, made attempts to obtain information about their relatives&#8216; places of detention. 
</p>
<p>The reasons for this are said to be twofold: fear that contact with the Government, including 
at the time of the arrest, would prompt further arrests; and the fact that, in some instances, 
on-going hostilities made going to official detention centres difficult, if not impossible.  
</p>
<p>19. Where the Government has refused to acknowledge the arrest and detention or to 
disclose the fate or whereabouts of the person concerned, the commission finds that there 
are reasonable grounds to believe that the crime of enforced disappearance has occurred. 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p><b>Annex VIII 
</b></p>
<p>[<i>English only</i>] 
</p>
<p><b>  Torture and other forms of ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i>  
</b></p>
<p>1. The commission continues to receive reports of the use of torture and other forms of 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, occurring most often in the context of interrogations 
by the Government&#8216;s intelligence agencies. Since 15 February 2012, the commission has 
</p>
<p>interviewed 81 people regarding allegations of torture and ill-treatment. Fifty nine of these 
interviews related to events within the reporting period.  
</p>
<p>2. Due to its lack of access, the commission has not been able to visit detention centres 
to interview detainees, those responsible for the detention centres or to observe detention 
conditions. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Findings 
</b></p>
<p>3. Thirty of the 59 individuals interviewed about events in this reporting period stated 
they had been arrested and/or detained by individuals from Government forces and 
<i>Shabbiha</i>. All but one of this group reported suffering physical violence during their 
detention. Nineteen others reported being present while others were tortured or otherwise 
ill-treated. This number includes ten individuals who had worked in detention centres or at 
checkpoints and who have since defected. The commission has not been able to verify the 
accounts received. Where possible, the commission observed the wounds/scars of alleged 
victims. 
</p>
<p>4. As set out in annex V (Arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance), most of 
those detained following arrest were taken to official detention centres. According to 
interviewees, interrogations in these centres were carried out under the auspices of the 
Syrian Arab Republic&#8216;s four principal intelligence agencies: Military Intelligence, Air 
Force Intelligence, General Security Directorate and the Political Security Directorate. The 
majority of those interviewed indicated that they had been interrogated by members of 
Military and/or Air Force Intelligence. All four intelligences agencies have central offices 
in Damascus as well as a network of regional, city and local sub-offices across the country. 
They appear to operate independently of each other. Questioning during interrogations 
reportedly revolved around reasons for protesting, involvement of the detainee or his or her 
family members in anti-Government armed groups and, in the case of detainees who were 
members of the Government forces, about alleged plans to defect. 
</p>
<p>5. Several interviewees could not, however, confirm which agencies conducted the 
interrogations and, in some instances, the precise location of their interrogations. Reported 
reasons for this included being blindfolded during transport in and out of detention 
facilities, being blindfolded during interrogations, being transferred between different 
facilities and undergoing multiple interrogations. 
</p>
<p>6. While the majority of those held were detained in official detention centres, six 
interviewees reported that they were also held in unofficial detention facilities, such as 
civilian houses, usually as a prelude to being transferred to an official centre. Four of the 
six &#8212; one of whom was a woman &#8212; were detained in late February/early March 2012 in </p>


<p>various neighbourhoods of Homs city. While held in unofficial centres, interviewees 
reported abuse by members of the army and by <i>Shabbiha</i>. 
</p>
<p>7. In a further nine cases, interviewees stated that they were beaten or otherwise 
assaulted during house searches or at checkpoints or witnessed the assault of others. While 
most interviewees were adult men, one was a young woman living in a village in Homs 
governorate in April 2012. She stated that she had been beaten by soldiers when she placed 
herself between them and her elder brother. In none of these cases were the victims 
subsequently detained.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Reports of torture and other forms of ill-treatment in official detention 
</b></p>
<p><b>centres 
</b></p>
<p>8. Reported methods of torture were consistent across the country. Interviewees 
described severe beatings about the head and body with electric cables, whips, metal and 
wooden sticks, and rifle butts; being burnt with cigarettes; being kicked; and being 
subjected to electric shocks applied to sensitive parts of the body, including the genitals. 
Six of those interviewed reported losing consciousness at points during their interrogations. 
</p>
<p>9. The commission also received multiple reports of detainees being beaten on the 
soles of the feet (<i>falaqa</i>). Common practices described included the placing of detainees 
into prolonged stress positions, including hanging from walls or ceilings by their wrists 
(<i>shabah</i>) and hanging by wrists tied behind their backs. Other methods reported were 
forcing detainees to bend at the waist and place their head, neck and legs through a car tire 
while beatings were administered (<i>dulab</i>); tying the detainees to a flat board with their head 
unsupported and either stretching them (as on a rack) or folding the board in half (the 
&#8213;flying carpet&#8214;). As detailed in annex VIII (Sexual violence), some detainees reportedly 
</p>
<p>suffered rape and other forms of sexual violence in the course of their detention. For many 
interviewees, scars and wounds, consistent with their accounts, were still visible.  
</p>
<p>10. Several forms of torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
meted out to detainees did not result in physical evidence. Reports detailed detainees being 
forcibly shaved, made to imitate dogs and to declare &#8213;there is no God but Bashar&#8214;. Other 
interviewees stated that they had been forced to strip and remain naked for prolonged 
periods. Three of those interviewed stated that they had been threatened with execution. 
One said he had been present when another detainee was threatened with sexual assault; 
another stated that his interrogators had threatened to arrest and rape female relatives. 
</p>
<p>11. One female interviewee stated that she, along with her nine year old sister, were 
arrested in May 2012 and taken to a Military Intelligence branch in Dar&#8216;a governorate. She 
</p>
<p>reported that her father was suspected of supporting the anti-Government armed groups. 
During the interrogation, which she stated was conducted by female interrogators, the 
interviewee was reportedly tied to a chair, had her breasts grabbed, being slapped and had 
her headscarf removed. She and her sister were released within a week. She stated that her 
sister had also been beaten while in detention. 
</p>
<p>12. Another interviewee, a 14-year-old boy who said he had taken part in protests in 
Idlib, reported that he had been arrested and detained in the Military Intelligence branch in 
Idlib in March 2012. He stated that he had received electric shocks and been beaten with a 
pipe during this interrogation.  
</p>
<p>13. Six of those interviewed had been moved among multiple detention facilities, run by 
different intelligence agencies. One interviewee reported being moved among ten different 
detention centres across four governorates in a five month period. Another interviewee was 
transferred among four different locations in Dar&#8216;a and Damascus, again over a five month </p>


<p>period. Where there have been multiple transfers, interviewees stated that they had suffered 
physical violence in each location. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Reports of torture and other forms of ill-treatment in unofficial 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention centres 
</b></p>
<p>14. Six interviewees reported being held in unofficial detention centres. In various 
locations in Homs governorate during late February and March 2012, three interviews were 
reportedly taken to houses or, in one case, a fitness centre and being held there. Two of 
those interviewed stated that they had been taken from their houses by members of the 
army during house searches. The third stated she and two other women, all veiled, were 
removed from a bus by <i>Shabbiha</i>. In all three cases, the interviewees stated they had been 
beaten while detained. In two of these cases, the perpetrators were reportedly members of 
the <i>Shabbiha</i>. 
</p>
<p>15. In another case, an interviewee stated that he had been stopped by unidentified 
individuals in Aleppo in April 2012. When searched, he stated he was found to be in 
possession of a quantity of foreign currency which was viewed as evidence of support of 
anti-Government armed groups. He was then reportedly taken to a building in Aleppo 
where he was beaten with electric wire, given electric shocks and interrogated. After a 
week he was taken to a different area of Aleppo and released. The commission has not been 
able to verify this account. 
</p>
<p>16. In two cases, the interviewees were former members of the army. One reported 
being arrested on suspicion of planning to defect and was held at a military barracks in Idlib 
governorate where he was given electric shocks, hung from the ceiling by his arms and 
beaten about his body and on the soles of his feet. The second interviewee worked at a 
military airport in Hama governorate which, he stated, had been converted into a makeshift 
detention centre where detainees were being assaulted. The commission has not been able 
to verify these accounts. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Reports of torture and other forms of ill-treatment during house 
</b></p>
<p><b>searches and at checkpoints 
</b></p>
<p>17. Nine of those interviewed reported being beaten or witnessing others being beaten 
during house searches or at checkpoints. There were corroborated reports of adult men 
being beaten by members of the army during house searches in Ibdita in late February 2012 
and in Homs city in March 2012. Other, unverified, reports of individuals being beaten 
during house searches were received in respect of events in Idlib city (April and May 
2012), Baniyas (April 2012), and Talf Rif&#8216;at (April 2012). 
</p>
<p>18. One interviewee reported being removed from his vehicle and beaten at a checkpoint 
near the Lebanese border, when photographs of demonstrations were discovered on his 
mobile phone. Another interviewee, a former member of the army, stated that he was 
present at a checkpoint in Idlib governorate in April 2012 when six men, including two 
defectors, were brought to the checkpoint where they were severely beaten with sticks and 
batons. The commission has not been able to verify these accounts. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Conditions of detention 
</b></p>
<p>19. The majority of detainees described being held in small, over-crowded cells. Two 
interviewees reported that the cells were so overcrowded that it was impossible to sit or lie 
down. All but one reported being given inadequate food and water. One interviewee stated </p>


<p>that, having been without water for a week, he drank his own urine to survive. Health 
conditions in detention were reportedly poor. Several interviewees stated that their cells 
were not equipped with toilets. Four interviewees described cells infested with insects, 
including lice. 
</p>
<p>20. The commission received information it could not corroborate on the denial of 
medication and medical treatment. One detainee stated that a man, held in his cell in the 
Idlib military intelligence building in early 2012, died, having not received medication for 
his diabetes. Another, held in the Kafr Susah military intelligence branch in Damascus, 
stated that a fellow detainee was left with a broken leg in his cell. 
</p>
<p>21. Five of those interviewed said they had been held for longer than two months. Two 
had been held for approximately five months. During this time, none reported receiving 
legal visits. Only one interviewee said he had received a family visit, a single visit from his 
wife. 
</p>
<p>22. As noted above, lack of access has rendered the commission unable to inspect 
detention centres. The commission has recorded accounts that, if verified, would amount to 
the breach of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, details of which 
are provided in annex I (Applicable law). 
</p>
<p><b> F. Legal conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>23. The commission confirms its previous finding that torture and other forms of cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment have been committed by Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i>. 
This is in violation of the Syrian Arab Republic&#8216;s obligations under international human 
rights and humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p>24. The commission determines that severe pain was inflicted upon persons in official 
and unofficial detention centres, during house searches and at checkpoints. The 
Commission further finds that torture was inflicted to punish, humiliate or to extract 
information from detainees. Much of the physical violence described by interviewees &#8211; 
including kicking, hitting, beating (including beating on the soles of the feet), flogging, 
inflicting electric shocks, burning, extended hanging from hand and/or leg chains and 
threatening the victim with execution in circumstances where the interrogators had the 
power to carry out this threat &#8211; have been found to constitute torture by various 
international tribunals.a 
</p>
<p>25. The commission finds there are reasonable grounds to believe that torture has been 
perpetrated as part of a widespread attack directed against a civilian population by 
Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i>, with knowledge of the attack. It, therefore, concludes 
that torture as a crime against humanity has been committed by Government forces and 
<i>Shabbiha</i>. On the basis of interviews conducted, members of the intelligence agencies, in 
particular Military and Air Force Intelligence appear to be primarily responsible for torture 
and ill-treatment. The commission notes the involvement of <i>Shabbiha</i> in acts of torture in 
unofficial detention centres in Homs city in February and March 2012. 
</p>
<p>26. The commission further finds that conduct such as forcibly shaving detainees and 
forcing them to imitate dogs constitutes cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Similarly, 
the conditions of detention as described in interviews conducted would, if verified, 
constitute the cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of those detained. 
</p>
<p>  
 a See annex I (Applicable law). </p>


<p><b> II. Anti-Government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>27. The commission conducted 15 interviews relating to the treatment of members of 
Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> by anti-Government armed groups. All interviewees 
claimed to be members of these armed groups. 
</p>
<p>28. All 15 interviews detail the capture, interrogation and either release or execution of 
those detained.b Interviewees stated that those captured were offered the chance to join anti-
Government forces. Those that did not were reportedly either executed or were used as part 
of an exchange for captured anti-Government fighters.  
</p>
<p>29. One individual, a member of an anti-Government armed group in Idlib governorate, 
stated that those who did not wish to join the anti-Government forces were imprisoned. 
Two other anti-Government fighters stated that makeshift detention centres had been set up 
in the Bab Amr and El Khaldiyah neighbourhoods in Homs. The commission also notes 
that the majority of those interviewed claimed that those who refused to join the anti-
Government armed groups were executed, in part because the groups had no means of 
housing and providing for prisoners. 
</p>
<p>30. Three of those interviewed stated that captured Government fighters and <i>Shabbiha</i> 
were tortured as part of an interrogation which took place before execution. One 
interviewee admitted that captured members of Government forces were beaten with 
electric wire and were threatened with drowning, with their heads forced in and out of 
water.  
</p>
<p>31. The commission has also received information indicating that Syrian security forces 
and/or their alleged supporters caught by the anti-Government armed groups have 
confessed under torture. Many of the video recordings of alleged incidents show those 
captured with signs of physical abuse, including bruising and bleeding. Two Iranians, held 
in late January 2012 and released in late April 2012, later made public statements about 
physical abuse suffered, including the breaking of bones, during their captivity. The 
commission could not verify those video recordings. 
</p>
<p><b>  Legal conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>32. The commission finds there are reasonable grounds to believe that torture and other 
forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment have been committed by anti-Government 
armed groups during interrogations of captured members of Government forces and 
<i>Shabbiha</i>. The commission determines that severe pain was inflicted to punish, humiliate or 
to extract information from detainees. 
</p>
<p>33. The commission determines, however, that the acts of torture were not committed as 
part of either a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population. Therefore, they do 
not constitute crimes against humanity but may be prosecutable as war crimes. 
</p>

<p><b>Annex IX 
</b></p>
<p>[<i>English only</i>] 
</p>
<p><b>  Sexual violence 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> 
</b></p>
<p>1. The commission conducted 43 interviews detailing incidents of sexual violence &#8212; 
against men, women and children &#8212; committed by Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> since 
February 2012. These interviews included two female and three male victims of rape. Also 
interviewed were five eyewitnesses of rape (one of whom was also a victim). Additionally, 
seven of those interviewed were former members of the army, now defected, who stated 
that rapes and other forms of sexual assault, committed by soldiers and <i>Shabbiha</i>, took 
place during the Government forces&#8216; ground operations as described below.  
</p>
<p>2. There are difficulties in collecting evidence in cases of sexual violence in Syria due 
to cultural, social and religious beliefs surrounding marriage and sexuality. Victims&#8216; 
</p>
<p>reluctance to disclose information stem from the trauma, shame and stigma linked to sexual 
assault. There are also serious consequences for female victims&#8216; lives and marriages. In one 
</p>
<p>incident, the commission was informed that a female rape victim was subsequently killed 
by her brother-in-law to &#8213;preserve the honour of the family&#8214;. Another interviewee stated 
another female rape victim had later killed herself. Several interviewees stated that female 
rape victims had been abandoned by their husbands and consequently struggled to survive. 
All victims and/or members of their families interviewed suffered psychological trauma. 
Many broke down during the interview. 
</p>
<p>3. The fear of rape and sexual assault also restricted the freedom of movement of 
women and young girls. Many of the women interviewed sought refuge in neighbouring 
countries in part because they feared sexual assault. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Findings 
</b></p>
<p>4. Information collected indicates that rape and other forms of sexual violence occurred 
in two distinct circumstances. The first is during the searches of houses and at checkpoints 
as Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> entered towns and villages; the second, in detention. In 
a minority of cases, all occurring in Homs city between late February and April 2012, there 
were reports of the abduction and rape of women, and corroborated accounts of women 
being forced to walk naked in the street.  
</p>
<p><b>  Sexual violence during house searches and at checkpoints 
</b></p>
<p>5. Fifteen of the interviewees alleged incidents of sexual violence committed during 
house searches and at checkpoints during the military operations in Homs between late 
February and May 2012, and in Al-Haffe in early June 2012. Five interviewees detailed 
incidents of sexual violence in Zabadani in late February 2012 and in various locations in 
Hama and Idlib governorates in April and May 2012. The sexual violence was reportedly 
perpetrated by soldiers and <i>Shabbiha</i>. </p>


<p><b>  Homs city ( Homs), February</b>&#8211;<b>May 2012 
</b></p>
<p>6. Eleven of those interviewed, including two of the victims, detailed rapes and sexual 
assault perpetrated by Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> during military operations in 
Homs. Four interviewees were themselves members of the Government forces in Homs 
during the military operations. 
</p>
<p>7. One victim, a man living with his family in Bab Amr, stated that in late 
February/early March 2012, 40-50 men wearing military clothes burst into his house at 5:00 
am. He described being forced to watch the gang rape of his wife and two elder daughters, 
14 and 11 years old, before then being raped himself, with his family being made to watch: 
</p>
<p><i>The men raped [my two daughters] and my wife, forcing them onto the ground to do 
</i></p>
<p><i>so. They raped them at the same time. When they began to rape my daughters, they 
</i></p>
<p><i>forced me to raise my head and watch. You cannot imagine what that felt like, as a 
</i></p>
<p><i>man to sit there and watch them do that. They raped each of them three times. Then 
</i></p>
<p><i>they forced me out of the chair and ordered me onto the ground. They raped me as 
</i></p>
<p><i>well and ordered my wife and children to watch. The men were jeering and said, 
</i></p>
<p>&#8220;Look at your father.&#8221; They dest<i>royed me. 
</i></p>
<p>8. The same interviewee stated that as the family fled the city with other residents of 
Bab Amr, the group was stopped at a checkpoint where soldiers detained eight girls. The 
girls were later released and, according to the interviewee, confirmed that they had been 
raped.  
</p>
<p>9. One of the defectors stated that he was deployed to Homs city in February 2012 and 
was given orders to shoot anything that moved. He said that commanders ordered them to 
tie up the men, tell them not to kill them, but to make them watch while they sexually 
assaulted their wives and daughters. The interviewee was present when members of the 
army raped women during the February 2012 military operations in Homs city. 
</p>
<p>10. Another interviewee spoke about the rape of his wife by members of the Syrian 
army during ground operations in Homs city in May 2012. He stated that his family fled 
their home during the shelling. His wife who had returned to check on their house was 
stopped by five soldiers, including one lieutenant, and reportedly raped by each of them.  
</p>
<p>11. Two residents of Karm-el-Zeytoun described soldiers and <i>Shabbiha</i> entering houses 
in March 2012 and raping females inside. One resident stated she witnessed soldiers raping 
and then executing a 16 year-old girl. A third interviewee, a young man, stated that 13 
soldiers together with a number of <i>Shabbiha</i> entered his house in Karm-el-Zeytoun, looted 
it and detained him in a nearby house. He stated that while detained he heard women 
screaming in an adjoining room and believed they were being raped.  
</p>
<p>12. Another soldier stated that he defected shortly after a gang rape of women by 
<i>Shabbiha</i> in Ar-Rastan in March 2012. He described being part of a group of soldiers 
ordered to surround a house while <i>Shabbiha</i> entered, after which he could hear women 
shouting to leave them alone and screaming that they would prefer to be killed. Two other 
defectors said that they heard colleagues bragging about committing rapes during the 
military operations in Bab Amr in late February 2012. 
</p>
<p><b>  Al-Haffe (Latakia), early June 2012 
</b></p>
<p>13. Four interviewees, including one victim, described rape occurring during military 
operations on, or in the days following 5 June 2012. 
</p>
<p>14. A female victim stated that she was in her house with three children when &#8213;heavily 
armed <i>Shabbihas</i>&#8214; broke in and demanded, at gunpoint, that she undress. She was accused 
of providing food and support to the anti-Government armed groups before being dragged </p>


<p>into the street and raped there by one of the men. She stated that other women were 
abducted and later raped by <i>Shabbiha</i>. She stated that her marriage had fallen apart 
following the rape. 
</p>
<p>15. Another interviewee stated that he had been an eyewitness to the rape of several 
women by intelligence agents in a house in Al-Haffe in early June 2012. Two other 
interviewees, both resident in Al-Haffe during June 2012, stated that <i>Shabbiha</i> were 
entering houses and raping women. One person detailed the public rape of women in the 
streets of Shier neighbourhood of Al-Haffe. 
</p>
<p><b>  Zabadani (<i>Rif Dimashq</i>), late February 2012 
</b></p>
<p>16. Two defectors stated that soldiers perpetrated rape during house searches in 
Zabadani in February 2012. One stated he was part of a contingent of soldiers that entered a 
house in order to loot it. When inside the house, the soldiers reportedly tied up the men and 
began to assault a 15-year-old girl. The interviewee, having been beaten by his colleagues, 
remained outside the house while the rape took place. Another defector stated that he heard 
his senior officers boasting about raping women during the February raid on Zabadani. 
</p>
<p><b>  Hama, Idlib and Aleppo governorates, April</b>&#8211;<b>May 2012 
</b></p>
<p>17. Two interviewees detailed rapes occurring in various locations in Hama governorate 
in April and May 2012. One, a defector, stated that he had been deployed to Hama in April 
2012 and was part of a contingent of soldiers undertaking house searches. He described the 
systematic looting of houses and stated that some soldiers and accompanying <i>Shabbiha</i> 
were raping women and girls who were found in the houses. He stated that some victims 
were killed after the rape.  
</p>
<p>18. Another interviewee stated that he collected bodies after the army and <i>Shabbiha</i> 
attacked Tamanaa in Idlib governorate on 12 May 2012. Among the bodies he noted one of 
a woman who had been eviscerated and who had a knife sticking out of her vagina. 
</p>
<p>19. The Commission also received reports of rapes and other serious sexual assaults 
taking place in Atarib (February 2012), Tal Rifat (April 2012) and Idlib city (April 2012). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Sexual violence in detention centres 
</b></p>
<p>20. The commission continues to receive reports of rape and sexual assault in detention 
centres, committed usually as part of a course of torture and/or ill-treatment. Two male 
members of the same family, detained from January to March 2012 at the offices of the 
Political Security in Damascus, described intelligence agents forcing them to rape each 
other.  
</p>
<p>21. Three interviewees stated that women were raped in detention centres in Latakia 
(March 2012), in Hama (March 2012) and in Dar&#8216;a (May 2012). In all instances the women 
were suspected of supporting the anti-Government armed groups, being involved in protests 
or of being family members of those involved in the armed groups or protests. In the latter 
incident, a woman reported that she had been arrested and brought to the Military 
Intelligence offices in Dar&#8216;a in late May 2012 where she was interrogated by female agents. 
</p>
<p>She stated that in the course of her interrogation, the agents attempted to remove her clothes 
and beat her. She stated she witnessed the gang rape of one of her friends who had attended 
protests in Dara&#8216;a, and who was being held in the same detention centre. 
</p>
<p>22. As detailed in Annex VI (Torture), many reports were received of male detainees 
having electric shocks applied to their genitals during interrogations. </p>


<p><b> C. Abduction and rape of women 
</b></p>
<p>23. The commission received reports of women being abducted from the streets of 
Homs city in April 2012. One woman, whose husband was a member of an anti-
Government armed group, was reportedly abducted along with six other women (including 
a 14 year old girl) in early April 2012 in Karm-el-Zeytoun by ten men, dressed in black. 
She stated that she and other women were placed in a van and blindfolded while being 
transported. They were taken to a place that looked &#8213;like a storage room&#8214;. There she saw 20 
naked women with injuries to their bodies. She and the other six women were raped while 
the men shouted at them, &#8213;<i>You want freedom, this is your freedom.</i>&#8214; 
</p>
<p>24. The interviewee remained in the room with the other women and girls for ten days, 
during which time they were vaginally and anally raped on multiple occasions. She stated 
that the other women were from various neighbourhoods of Homs city, including Baba 
Amr, Bab Sbaa and El Khaldiyah. The women were released, allegedly, as part of a 
prisoner exchange between the <i>Shabbiha</i> and the FSA. Following her release, she was 
abandoned by her husband. 
</p>
<p>25. Another woman interviewed described being pulled off a bus by <i>Shabbiha</i> at a 
checkpoint in Bab Sbaa in April 2012. She and two other veiled women were reportedly 
detained while other, unveiled women were allowed back on the bus. She stated that she 
and the two other women were severely beaten before being taken to a house where there 
were eight other women from Al-Houla who were naked and injured. She stated that she 
and one other woman were &#8213;rescued&#8214; by a <i>Shabbiha</i> who knew them. She was not aware of 
what happened to the third woman. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Women forced to walk naked in the streets 
</b></p>
<p>26. The commission also received corroborated reports of women being forced at 
gunpoint to walk naked in the streets of the Karm-el-Zeytoun neighbourhood of Homs, 
again in February 2012. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Legal conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Commission finds that there are reasonable grounds to believe rape has been 
perpetrated against men, women and children by members of Government forces and 
<i>Shabbiha</i>. The rape and sexual violence was committed in connection to the armed conflict 
and could be prosecuted as a war crime. Rape and sexual assault also formed part of torture 
in both official and unofficial detention centres in violation of IHRL and IHL. 
</p>
<p>28. Having previously identified the military operations in Homs city in February and 
March 2012 and in Al-Haffe in June 2012 as part of a widespread or systematic attack 
against a civilian population, the commission finds that the rapes which occurred during 
this attack, made with knowledge of the attacks, could be prosecuted as crimes against 
humanity. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Anti-Government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>29. The commission has not received any reports of rape or other forms of sexual assault 
perpetrated by members of the anti-Government armed groups. Lack of access to the 
country has further complicated the investigation of alleged incidents of sexual violence by 
all parties to the conflict. </p>


<p><b>Annex X 
</b></p>
<p>[<i>English only</i>] 
</p>
<p><b>  </b>Violation of children&#8217;s rights<b> 
</b></p>
<p>1. The commission conducted 168 interviews in which violations of children&#8216;s rights 
were alleged. Of these, 30 interviewees were under 18 years of age.  
</p>
<p>2. In the commission&#8216;s interviews with children and their care-givers the adverse 
psychological and social impact of the continued violence was evident. Many of the 
children interviewed had been injured during the violence and/or saw the death or injury of 
parents, relatives or friends. Some children displayed signs of high stress, either mirroring 
that of the (often sole) caregiver or due to events the child had experienced him or herself. 
Some children recounted that they were &#8213;sad&#8214;, while others explained that they were angry 
</p>
<p>and wanted to &#8213;take revenge&#8214; for those who killed their family or community members. 
</p>
<p>Many complained of sleeplessness and anxiety, or lack of ability to concentrate, all signs of 
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Killing and injuring of children 
</b></p>
<p>3. The commission recorded the death of 125 children killed during the reporting 
period. The majority are male.  
</p>
<p>4. The commission recorded the killing and injuring of children during the shelling of 
Atarib (Aleppo) in February; Bab Amr neighbourhood of Homs city between February and 
May; Al-Qusayr (Homs) between February and July; Sermin (Idlib) on 22 March; Kafar 
Zeita (Hama) in late March; Taftanaz (Idlib) on 4 April; Al-Houla (Homs) on 25 May; El 
Haffe (Latakia) between 4 and 12 June; Salma (Latakia) on 11 June; Azaz (Aleppo) in late 
June; and in Tremseh (Hama) on 12 July. During a visit to a hospital in Turkey, the 
commission saw, and met with the family of a two year old girl, injured in the June shelling 
of Azaz. 
</p>
<p>5. As noted in annex V, when Government ground forces moved into towns and 
villages, usually following shelling, snipers were often positioned on roofs and other raised 
positions. There were multiple reports of children being killed and wounded by sniper fire. 
In Atarib (Aleppo) in February, a 10 year old boy, playing in front of his family home, was 
reportedly shot dead by a sniper positioned on top of a nearby police building. Another 
interviewee from Atarib stated that he had seen a child shot in the chest by a sniper in 
February. Another 14 year old boy was injured in Atarib in the same month when he was 
shot in the legs by a sniper, while on his way to buy food at a local market. The commission 
received further reports of children shot by snipers in Bab Amr in February, March and 
May; Taftanaz on 3 April; Aleppo in late April; Anadan village (Aleppo) in late April; and 
Al-Haffe on 4&#8211;6 June. 
</p>
<p>6. Children were also killed during attacks on protests &#8212; as reportedly occurred in 
Menaq village (Aleppo) on 15 March &#8212; and in attacks on villages believed to be 
harbouring defectors or members of anti-Government armed groups. One defector asserted 
that children were also targeted for killing or arrest to pressure their parents to cease their 
protest activities. He stated that, &#8213;&#8230; If someone is <i>an activist we will arrest any member of </i></p>


<p><i>his or her family to pressure them to turn themselves in. Worse than that is the dual beating 
</i></p>
<p><i>and imprisonment of a father and his son in order to break the adult. It is very carefully 
</i></p>
<p><i>thought out.</i>&#8214; 
</p>
<p>7. There are multiple reports of children killed during military ground operations and 
house searches. As described more fully in annex V, Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> 
conducted a military operation in the village of Ain Larouz to look for defectors. On 4 
March, Government forces detained 35 people, including two boys of 14 and 16 years and a 
10 year old girl. On 12 March, all but four were released. Bodies of the two boys along with 
two adults were discovered lying just outside the village.  
</p>
<p>8. Interviewees recounted the killing of children in Atarib in February; Bab Amr in 
March; Karm-el-Zeytoun in March; Tal Rifat (Aleppo) in early April; Taftanaz in early 
May and in Al Qubeir (Hama) in June. These children were killed with members of their 
families during military ground operations in the named towns and villages.  
</p>
<p>9. Children were also amongst the victims killed in Al-Houla on 25 May. UN 
observers found at least 108 bodies, 41 of them children. Some had been killed by shrapnel 
during shelling, but most appeared to have been shot at close range.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Children in detention 
</b></p>
<p>10. Multiple reports of arrests and detentions of children were received. Children were 
detained during or immediately following protests or during ground operations and house 
searches. In two cases, children appear to have been arrested, along with older family 
members, because of familial links to fighters in anti-government armed groups. 
</p>
<p>11. Children interviewed by the commission described being beaten, blindfolded, 
subjected to prolonged stress positions, whipped with electrical cables, scarred by cigarette 
burns and, in two recorded cases, subjected to electrical shocks to the genitals.  
</p>
<p>12. One 15 year old boy said he was arrested in March by security and plain clothes 
officers after protesting, and taken to a Political Security office in Dara&#8216;a in March. He 
stated, &#8213;<i>There were lots of young men, children and adolescents and also older people. I 
</i></p>
<p><i>was standing and the officer stood in front of me and hit me across the face. They put 
</i></p>
<p><i>electricity on my </i>temples and my stomach &#8230; They asked us, &#8222;Where are the weapons!&#8223; &#8230; 
</p>
<p><i>They used lots of electricity. It felt like five hours and went on until morning, I think. There 
</i></p>
<p><i>were kids as young as 10 with me in the cell ...</i>&#8214; He was released five days later only after 
signing a confession &#8213;&#8230; <i>stating that we were terrible boys and had done many things 
</i></p>
<p>wrong&#8230;I also had to sign a blank paper.&#8214;  
</p>
<p>13. A 14-year-old boy stated that he was arrested during a demonstration in Idlib in 
March. He had been taken with 12 others to the Military Intelligence branch in Idlib where 
he was beaten with a pipe and given electric shocks. Another interviewee stated that her 17 
year old son had been arrested by <i>Shabbiha</i> in Blin (Idlib) after participating in protests in 
late February. She stated that he had been taken to detention where he was beaten, 
subjected to electric shocks and made to &#8213;kneel and pray for Bashar al-Assad&#8214;.  
</p>
<p>14. Eight detainees, including two minors, stated that minors and adults were held in the 
same cells. This was said to have occurred in the cells of Aleppo central prison; the 
Political Security office in Dara&#8216;a; the Military Intelligence office in Idlib and Adra central 
</p>
<p>prison which was under the control of Air Force Intelligence. One adult detainee, held in an 
unknown location in Damascus, stated he was held in a small overcrowded room with adult 
and child detainees, the youngest of who appeared to be 13 years old. Child detainees 
reported enduring the same conditions of detention as described in annex VIII. </p>


<p><b> C. Sexual violence 
</b></p>
<p>15. As noted in annex IX, the commission received a report of the gang rape of two 
young girls, aged 11 and 14 years, by men in military clothes, in Bab Amr in late 
February/early March. The girls&#8216; father was forced to watch the rape. His daughters were 
reportedly then forced to watch the rape of their father. A resident of Karm-el-Zeytoun 
(Homs) stated she had witnessed soldiers raping a 16-year-old girl during military ground 
operations in March. A defector stated that he had been present at the sexual assault of a 15 
year old girl in Zabadani by soldiers during a house search in February. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Recruitment and use of children 
</b></p>
<p>16. No evidence of Government forces formally conscripting or enlisting children under 
the age of 18 years has been received.  
</p>
<p>17. However, the commission documented at least three separate incidents in which 
Government forces reportedly used children as young as eight as hostages and as human 
shields. Two interviewees stated that on 21 February in Abdita (Idlib), soldiers forced 
women and children to walk with them as they moved around the town. When the soldiers 
withdrew, reportedly three families, including a number of children, were forced to walk 
alongside a moving tank. The families were released once the soldiers reached the outskirts 
of the town. Another interviewee stated that, in Taftanaz on 3 April, women and children 
were reportedly removed from their houses by soldiers and forced to walk in front of a tank 
as it moved through the town. In Ain Larouz in March, an interviewee stated that several 
dozen children, boys and girls ranging between the ages of eight and 13 years, were 
forcibly taken from their homes. These children were then reportedly placed by soldiers and 
<i>Shabbiha</i> in front of the windows of buses carrying military personnel into the raid on the 
village. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Attacks on schools and hospitals 
</b></p>
<p>18. Schools in various locations across Syria have been looted, vandalized and burned 
by Government forces in response to student protests. A teacher from the village of Abdita 
(Idlib) testified that since January schools have effectively been closed in the entire region 
due to fears of imminent military attack. Many schools had been the site of protests and 
were therefore targeted by Government forces. The interviewee described how, in 
February, in response to anti-Government protests, the military fired at Abdita School, 
broke into the classrooms, destroyed school materials and placed graffiti slogans on the 
walls, all variants of the slogan, &#8213;Al Assad or no one else&#8214;.  
</p>
<p>19. As detailed in section III.I of the report of the commission of inquiry 
(A/HRC/21/50), multiple accounts were received concerning the use of schools by 
Government forces (most often the army and intelligence services) and <i>Shabbiha</i>, as 
military staging grounds, temporary bases and sniper posts. Several interviewees also stated 
that the intelligence forces and the <i>Shabbiha</i> had installed gun emplacements on the roofs 
of schools while students were attending classes. The attack on schools has disrupted, and 
in many cases, curtailed children&#8216;s ability to access education. 
</p>
<p>20. Aside from the military operations that prevented civilians from accessing hospitals 
over lengthy periods of time, reports also indicated that injured persons, including children 
and their families, failed to seek medical treatment out of fear of attack by the Government 
for suspected association with anti-Government armed groups. Many children who were 
injured were not able to receive hospital care and were taken to private or &#8213;underground&#8214; </p>


<p>field clinics that could treat only the most rudimentary injuries. A nurse from Idlib stated 
she had treated dozens of women and children in her home during attacks in early March, 
and that two children died because there was no appropriate equipment and because she 
was not skilled enough to stop the bleeding of severe wounds.  
</p>
<p>21. The fear of arrest and torture by Government agents in hospitals denied basic 
healthcare to both children and women. With a few exceptions, field clinics could do more 
than stabilize those in frontline communities who were severely wounded. These patients 
then had to endure days of hardship under precarious circumstances en route to seeking 
health care in neighbouring countries. Testimonies point to the fact that many children 
could not tolerate the stress of these transfers and died either before they could be 
transferred or on the road to the border.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Legal conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>22. Evidence gathered clearly indicates that violations of children&#8216;s rights by 
Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> have continued during this reporting period.  
</p>
<p>23. The legal conclusions of annexes IV (special inquiry into Al-Houla), V (unlawful 
killing), VII (arbitrary detentions and enforced disappearances), VIII (torture), IX (sexual 
violence) apply, in respect of the treatment of children by Government forces and 
<i>Shabbiha</i>. 
</p>
<p>24. There are multiple reports of minors being held in the same cells as adults, in breach 
of the Government&#8216;s obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Anti-Government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>25. Eleven interviewees, including four minors, spoke about the use of children by anti-
Government armed groups. All stated that anti-Government armed groups, including the 
FSA, used children to work in support roles such as assisting in medical evacuations or as 
messengers or porters. Five of those interviewed said the anti-Government armed groups 
used children under the age of 18 &#8212; and in one account, below the age of 15 &#8212; as fighters. 
</p>
<p>26. A 17-year-old interviewee stated that he worked in a FSA medical evacuation team 
in Hama governorate. He said it was FSA policy that &#8213;only at 17 could a gun be used, 
</p>
<p>mostly for guard duty and no active fighting&#8214;. Three other interviewees, including two 
</p>
<p>minors, stated that they had seen or were aware of 17 year olds actively fighting for the 
anti-Government armed groups. One said that his 17 year old brother was &#8213;<i>a member of the 
FSA Al Khatib battalion [and] went to the second floor of a house [in Taftanaz, Idlib 
</i></p>
<p><i>governorate, in April] with a Kalashnikov and shot four soldiers</i>&#8214;. Another interviewee 
</p>
<p>stated he saw two fighters, approximately 15 years old, fighting with the FSA-affiliated Al 
Farouk or Bab Amr battalions in Homs city in June. 
</p>
<p>27. Another interviewee spoke about the killing of a 17 year old boy &#8212; who was 
reportedly fighting with the FSA &#8212; during armed clashes with Government forces in 
March in Idlib governorate. 
</p>
<p>28. A 14 year old boy stated that he was given and used a weapon while fighting with 
the FSA for two days in Idlib in March. 
</p>
<p>29. There is significant evidence of anti-Government armed groups&#8216; use of children in 
auxiliary roles. One 17 year old interviewee worked as part of a FSA medical evacuation 
team, taking injured persons mainly from the Hama governorate into Turkey. He stated that 
in his team there were &#8213;about 15 boys under the age of 15 years&#8214;, and that the youngest in </p>


<p>his group was 14. The same interviewee stated that boys between the ages of 15 and 17 also 
performed duties including delivering messages between FSA units, cooking for units in the 
field and delivering medical supplies to field hospitals in front line units. He stated that no 
girls fought or worked as auxiliary support to the anti-Government armed groups.  
</p>
<p>30. Two other interviewees, both minors, stated that anti-Government armed groups 
used children aged 15 years and above to assist in the loading of ammunition. 
</p>
<p>31. The use of children as part of medical evacuation teams and as couriers has exposed 
them to hostilities. One interviewee stated that one minor, who had been part of a medical 
evacuation team, was shot and killed by a sniper while attempting to evacuate a woman and 
two young men from Hama city.  
</p>
<p>32. In a separate incident in March, the commission was informed about four boys, 
under 18 who were injured by sniper fire trying to evacuate injured from Helfaya. 
According to the same interviewee, three boys, one 15 year old and two 17 year olds, were 
captured by Government forces while working as part of a medical evacuation team in 
Hama city.  
</p>
<p>33. A 16 year old boy who was shot by a sniper outside of Homs while evacuating a 
wounded girl, explained that he was volunteering to assist the FSA with medical 
evacuations &#8220;&#8230; because it is all they [FSA] will allow me to do&#8230; How can I do nothing 
<i>when they kill my family and my community?</i>&#8214; 
</p>
<p>34. The commission received assurances from Colonel Riad al-Asaad that an FSA 
policy not to use children in combat is in place. There is evidence to suggest, however, that 
this policy is not uniformly being adhered to by the FSA and other anti-Government armed 
groups. It is also unclear whether the understanding of &#8213;in combat&#8214; by the anti-Government 
armed groups encompasses the auxiliary roles described above. 
</p>
<p><b>  Legal conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>35. As the anti-Government armed groups are not State parties, they are not bound 
under the Optional Protocol, which sets 18 as the minimum age for direct participation in 
hostilities, recruitment into armed groups and compulsory recruitment by Governments.  
</p>
<p>36. The commission observes, however, that the conduct of anti-Government armed 
groups, as a party to an armed conflict, is within the jurisdiction of the International 
Criminal Court which has made &#8213;conscripting or enlisting children under the age of fifteen 
</p>
<p>years into armed forces or groups or using them to participate actively in hostilities&#8214; a war 
crime. The term &#8213;participate&#8214; covers both direct participation in combat and also active 
</p>
<p>participation in military activities linked to combat, for example scouting, spying, sabotage 
and the use of children as decoys, couriers or at military checkpoints. Use of children in a 
direct support function such as acting as bearers to take supplies to the front line, or 
activities at the front line itself, would be included. 
</p>
<p>37. The commission considers that there is currently insufficient information to reach a 
finding that anti-Government armed groups have been using children under the age of 15 to 
participate actively in hostilities. It notes with concern, however, reports that children under 
the age of 18 are fighting and performing auxiliary roles for anti-Government armed 
groups. </p>


<p><b>Annex XI 
</b></p>
<p>[<i>English only</i>] 
</p>
<p><b>  Pillaging and destruction of property 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i>  
</b></p>
<p>1. The commission corroborated reports of pillaging, destruction and burning of 
property by Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> during their military operations. Such acts 
occurred in two contexts: first as a consequence of the shelling of towns and villages and 
second during the searches for defectors and members of armed groups and their supporters 
that took place during ground operations. The former context is discussed in annex VI 
(indiscriminate attacks). In the latter context, the commission interviewed 43 witnesses who 
described Government forces burning, destroying and pillaging their property in the wake 
of searches. 
</p>
<p>2. Interviewees stated that the pillaging and destruction were targeted against groups 
and individuals who appeared to be defectors; members of anti-Government armed groups; 
demonstrators and family members of the aforementioned. In particular, family members of 
defectors described how their homes, farms and shops were burned following the defection 
of their relatives. In some instances the looting, burning and destruction of property 
appeared to be directed at entire communities rather than specific individuals. 
</p>
<p>3. According to soldiers who later defected, the looting and burning of property of 
opposition activists and defectors was intended, inter alia, to impose financial constraints 
on them and on their activities. Government soldiers and <i>Shabbiha</i> also benefited from 
these acts financially, conducting them with complete impunity. They were viewed as a 
form of reward for their allegiance to the Government. One defector told the commission: 
</p>
<p>I never got direct orders to [pillage/destroy], but it was every man&#8216;s understanding 
that he was allowed to do everything he wanted without being held accountable for 
that. Not only that, but also when someone is seen not to be active in doing these 
things, he will be questioned about his loyalty to the regime and his relation with the 
oppositions. 
</p>
<p>4. In Idlib in March 2012, instances were recorded of looting followed by burning of 
homes after which the army and local militias sold the looted goods. One defector told the 
commission of his looting prior to his defections:  
</p>
<p>&#8213;Just go and get a TV, something for yourself, there is no FSA here&#8230; It [the 
</p>
<p>military base] was like a flea market. Anything you want you can find there, 
including gold. Nothing was left in the houses... [We] swapped things and sold them 
to each other.&#8214; 
</p>
<p>5. Twelve different witnesses described the deliberate burning and looting of homes 
and the purposeful destruction of personal property in various neighbourhoods of Homs. 
Five witnesses reported the burning of more than 100 houses during the attack on Anadan 
(Aleppo) in March and again in April 2012. Other witnesses put the number of houses 
burned at over 300.  
</p>
<p>6. One defector stated that he was ordered to shell and then to raid the village of 
Yabrud (Rif Dimashq) in March 2012. He had at his disposal six buses of Government 
forces together with tanks. A local government informer, whose face was covered, </p>


<p>accompanied them during this operation. The informer guided them toward houses of 
activists and defectors. Whenever the informer pointed out the house of a defector, FSA 
fighter or opposition activist, the soldiers would loot and burn it. 
</p>
<p>7. Demonstrations occurred regularly in the village of Marayane (Idlib), one of which 
took place on 11 April 2012. A defector stated that on 12 April, he was with Government 
forces when they raided Marayane (Idlib) using T72 tanks, BMPs and 14.5 mm machine 
guns. Before entering the village his forces began shelling randomly in an effort to &#8213;weaken 
</p>
<p>the enemy.&#8214; Once inside the village, they burned more than 100 houses. He recalled 
specifically shelling two houses, ensuring they were razed to the ground. One belonged to 
the headmaster of the high school, while the other to an agricultural engineer. The defector 
presumed, but could not confirm, that the two men were suspected anti-Government 
fighters. The rest of the houses were looted by the soldiers and then shelled or burned.  
</p>
<p>8. Another interviewee stated that in Mare&#8216;e (Aleppo) on 10 April 2012, Government 
forces burned 386 houses and some two hundred shops burned during the search 
operations. He added that all residents fled when they knew that military and security forces 
were about to raid their village. When people returned, they saw painted on the walls, 
&#8213;from here Al-Assad forces passed; if you return, we will return,&#8214; and &#8213;there is no God but 
Bashar al-Assad&#8214;. 
</p>
<p>9. Thirteen individual accounts described widespread looting and destruction of 
property in Tal Rifat (Aleppo), Bayda and Jabal-az-Zawiyah (Idlib) in April 2012. When 
Government forces departed these villages after the attack, the inhabitants returned to find 
the electricity cut, crops destroyed, livestock killed, mosques and schools destroyed, money 
stolen and houses emptied of their furniture, jewellery, clothes and appliances. Shops had 
been looted completely and then destroyed either by burning or by shelling. Vehicles had 
been either stolen or destroyed. 
</p>
<p>10. Corroborated evidence was collected of pillaging, deliberate destruction and burning 
of property by pro-Government forces in Bab Amr (Homs), end of April 2012; Ablin 
(Idlib), 16 June 2012; Ibdita (Idlib), 21 February 2012; Jisr-esh-Shughour (Idlib), March 
2012; Al Atarib (Aleppo), 15 February 2012; Taftanaz (Idlib) 4 and 5 April 2012; Sermin 
(Idlib), 22 March 2012; Azaz (Aleppo), April 2012; Dar&#8216;a, June 2012; Hama, end of May 
and beginning of June 2012; al-Haffah (al-Ladhiqiyah), 13 June 2012; and Anadan 
(Aleppo), 7 April 2012.  
</p>
<p><b>  Legal conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>11. There are reasonable grounds to believe that Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> 
committed the war crime of pillage. The commission also determined that Government 
forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> engaged in the destruction and burning of property during house 
searches. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Anti-Government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>12. The commission received no reports of pillaging or destruction of property by anti-
Government armed groups, but lack of access to Syria hampered investigations in this 
regard. The Government provided information about crimes allegedly perpetrated by anti-
Government armed groups, including looting and vehicle theft, which the commission was 
unable to corroborate. Consequently, the commission has been unable to reach any findings 
with regard to the alleged pillaging, burning and destruction of property by anti-
Government armed groups. </p>
