<p><b>  Mission to Equatorial Guinea (16 - 20 August 2010)</b>&#8727;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> At the invitation of the Government of Equatorial Guinea, the Working Group on 
the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of 
the right of peoples to self-determination visited Equatorial Guinea from 16 to 20 August 
2010. In accordance with its mandate, the Working Group focused on the investigations 
and prosecutions relating to the attempted coup d&#8217;&#233;tat of March 2004 and to the armed 
attack on the presidential palace by alleged mercenaries on 17 February 2009. The Working 
Group also inquired about the activities of private military and security companies 
operating in Equatorial Guinea.  
</p>
<p> The coup attempt of March 2004 has been the most widely reported incident clearly 
involving mercenaries, some of whom were employees or former employees of private 
military and security companies from several other countries. The Working Group found 
that the attempt illustrates the possible close and disturbing links between mercenaries and 
some private military and security companies, making the monitoring of such links all the 
more necessary. In this regard, the Working Group recommends that the Government adopt 
legislation to regulate the activities of such companies and their employees. 
</p>
<p> With regard to the armed attack on the presidential palace by alleged mercenaries on 
17 February 2009, the Working Group regrets the lack of transparency on the part of the 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 &#8727; The summary is being circulated in all official languages. The report, which is annexed to the 
</p>
<p>summary, is being circulated in Spanish and in the language of submission only.

</p>
<p>authorities and the lack of cooperation extended to the Working Group during its visit. In 
this regard, the Working Group recommends that the Government provide full information 
in a transparent manner regarding the attack on the presidential palace, and in particular, 
that all judgements rendered in the criminal cases relating to the attack be made available to 
the public. In addition, the Working Group urges the Government to provide explanations 
as to how the four men on trial for their alleged involvement in the attack were brought 
back from Benin to Equatorial Guinea. The Working Group strongly condemns their 
execution, which followed a summary trial that severely lacked due process and was 
carried out so promptly as to deny the four men all possibility of appeal. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group recommends that the Government consider developing national 
legislation to criminalize mercenarism and mercenary-related acts. In this context, the 
Working Group recommends that the Penal Code be revised and updated to bring it into 
line with the country&#8217;s international human rights obligations. The Working Group also 
recommends that the Government consider acceding to International Convention against 
the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries as a matter of priority.  
</p>
<p> Since all mercenaries should be held accountable for their actions, the Working 
Group recommends that anyone who is accused of involvement in a mercenary-related 
incident be tried by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal and in compliance with 
international human rights standards. The Working Group also recommends that anyone 
accused of involvement in a mercenary-related incident be treated in accordance with 
international human rights standards, in particular the prohibition of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government of Equatorial Guinea, the Working Group on 
the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of 
the right of peoples to self-determination visited Equatorial Guinea from 16 to 20 August 
2010. In accordance with general practice, the Working Group was represented by two of 
its members, Amada Benavides de P&#233;rez and Jos&#233; Luis G&#243;mez del Prado.<b>1</b>  
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 2005/2, the Commission on Human Rights requested the Working 
Group to monitor mercenaries and mercenary-related activities in all their forms and 
manifestations in different parts of the world, and study and identify emerging issues, 
manifestations and trends regarding mercenaries or mercenary-related activities and their 
impact on human rights, particularly on the right of peoples to self-determination. In its 
resolution 7/21, the Human Rights Council also mandated the Working Group to monitor 
and study the effects of the activities of private companies offering military assistance, 
consultancy and security services on the international market on the enjoyment of human 
rights, particularly the right of peoples to self-determination, and to prepare draft 
international basic principles that encourage respect for human rights on the part of those 
companies in their activities. In its resolution 15/12, the Council requested that the Working 
Group continue to monitor mercenaries and mercenary-related activities in all their forms 
and manifestations, including private military and security companies, in different parts of 
the world, including instances of protection provided by Governments to individuals 
involved in mercenary activities, as well as to continue to study and identify sources and 
causes, emerging issues, manifestations and trends regarding mercenaries or mercenary-
related activities and their impact on human rights, particularly on the right of peoples to 
self determination. 
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group is grateful to the Government of Equatorial Guinea for its 
invitation. In accordance with its mandate, the Working Group focused on the 
investigations and prosecutions relating to the attempted coup d&#8217;&#233;tat of March 2004 and the 
armed attack on the presidential palace by alleged mercenaries on 17 February 2009. The 
Working Group also inquired about the activities of private military and security companies 
operating in Equatorial Guinea.  
</p>
<p>4. In the present report, the Working Group uses the term &#8220;mercenary&#8221; as defined in 
article 1 of the International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and 
Training of Mercenaries, namely, any person who (a) is especially recruited locally or 
abroad in order to fight in an armed conflict; (b) is motivated to take part in the hostilities 
essentially by the desire for private gain and, in fact, is promised, by or on behalf of a party 
to the conflict, material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to 
combatants of similar rank and functions in the armed forces of that party; (c) is neither a 
national of a party to the conflict nor a resident of territory controlled by a party to the 
conflict; (d) is not a member of the armed forces of a party to the conflict; and (e) has not 
been sent by a State which is not a party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its 
armed forces.  
</p>
<p>5. Article 1 of the Convention also provides that a mercenary is any person who, in any 
other situation (a) is specially recruited locally or abroad for the purpose of participating in 
a concerted act of violence aimed at (i) overthrowing a Government or otherwise 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 1 The Working Group is composed of five independent experts serving in their personal capacities. 
</p>
<p>Amada Benavides de P&#233;rez (Colombia) was the Chairperson-Rapporteur from July to September 
</p><p>2010. The other members were Najat al-Hajjaji (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), Jos&#233; Luis G&#243;mez del 
Prado (Spain), Alexander Nikitin (Russian Federation) and Faiza Patel (Pakistan). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/32/Add.2

</b></p>
<p>undermining the constitutional order of a State; and (ii) undermining the territorial integrity 
of a State; (b) is motivated to take part therein essentially by the desire for significant 
private gain and is prompted by the promise or payment of material compensation; (c) is 
neither a national nor a resident of the State against which such an act is directed; (d) has 
not been sent by a State on official duty; and (e) is not a member of the armed forces of the 
State on whose territory the act is undertaken. 
</p>
<p>5. In the present report, a private military and/or security company is to be understood 
as a corporate entity which provides on a compensatory basis military and/or security 
services by physical persons and/or legal entities.2  
</p>
<p>6. It should be noted as a preliminary point that the Working Group faced serious 
problems when attempting to have access to information and relevant interlocutors during 
the visit. Despite the fact that the authorities were notified of the requested meetings several 
months before the visit, during the visit meetings were either organized on an ad hoc basis 
or did not take place at all. Even where the meetings did take place, the Working Group 
was not provided with clear and detailed responses to its questions. In particular, it was not 
granted access to documents and the persons detained in connection with the alleged 
mercenary incident of 17 February 2009. 
</p>
<p>7. During the visit, the Working Group held meetings in Malabo with the Head of 
State, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, and senior officials of the executive, the 
judiciary and the legislative, including the Third Deputy Prime Minister for Human Rights, 
the Presidential Adviser on Human Rights, the Minister and Vice-Minister for Justice, the 
Deputy Defence Minister and the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Attorney 
General, the President of the Supreme Court of Justice, the Speaker of Parliament and the 
Vice-President of the National Human Rights Commission. Meetings were also held with 
representatives of political parties and lawyers. In addition, the Working Group met with 
several representatives of the diplomatic community. It met with the United Nations 
Resident Coordinator as well as with representatives of a private military and security 
company contracted by the Government and operating in Equatorial Guinea. The Working 
Group had the opportunity to visit Punta Europa, the port facility of oil companies on the 
island of Bioko, to obtain information on the security arrangements of oil companies in this 
area. 
</p>
<p><b> II. International human rights commitments 
</b></p>
<p>8. Equatorial Guinea has ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Equatorial Guinea is also a party to the 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women, and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale 
of children, child prostitution and child pornography. It is not a party to the International 
Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries, although 
it ratified the Organization of African Unity Convention for the Elimination of 
Mercenarism in Africa on 12 February 2003. 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/32/Add.2

</p>
<p>9. In recent years, Equatorial Guinea has received two visits by special procedures: one 
by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, in July 2007, and one by the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, in 
November 2008.3 
</p>
<p>10. Equatorial Guinea was examined under the universal periodic review mechanism in 
December 2009.4 It accepted most of the recommendations formulated on that occasion and 
rejected others, including those relating to the abolition of the death penalty and election 
reform. Among other commitments, the Government pledged to put an end to torture 
practices, arbitrary and secret detentions, to ensure the independence of the judiciary, to 
fight corruption and to respect freedom of expression, assembly and association. 
</p>
<p>11. There is no law in Equatorial Guinea dealing specifically with mercenaries and no 
crime of mercenarism in the Penal Code. The Code was inherited from the Spanish colonial 
era and essentially reflects the legal standards that were in force under General Franco&#8217;s 
dictatorship. 5  As such, it urgently needs to be revised and updated to bring it into 
conformity with the country&#8217;s international human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>12. On 2 November 2006, Equatorial Guinea adopted the Prohibition of Torture Act 
No.6/2006 in order to implement the Convention against Torture into domestic law. Under 
the Act, those found guilty of committing acts of torture may receive prison sentences of up 
to six months and fines of up to 300,000 Central African Francs (CFA). The law also 
prohibits the use of evidence obtained as a result of torture. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Mercenary-related activities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Possible causes 
</b></p>
<p>13. Equatorial Guinea is a small developing State. Whether in terms of area 
(28,000 km2) or population (estimated by the Government to be around one million),6 it is 
one of the smallest countries in continental Africa. One should also note that Equatorial 
Guinea is the only Spanish-speaking country in the whole of the continent. It is made up of 
a mainland region and several islands, including the island of Bioco, which hosts the capital 
Malabo. As a small developing State, its military resources are relatively limited and there 
is no doubt that Equatorial Guinea is most vulnerable to attack.7  
</p>
<p>14. Equatorial Guinea gained independence from Spain on 12 October 1968. Francisco 
Mac&#237;as Nguema was elected the first president of the country and soon established a brutal 
dictatorship that lasted 11 years. During that period, it is estimated that around 100,000 
people were killed or left the country, which amounted to almost one third of the population 
at the time. President Mac&#237;as declared himself president for life in 1972. He was 
overthrown in 1979 in a coup orchestrated by Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo. President 
Obiang and his political party, the Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea, have remained 
in power ever since. A new Constitution was approved by popular vote in 1982, and the 
first presidential elections were organized in 1989.  
</p>
<p>15. Presidential terms are for seven years under the Constitution. President Obiang was 
re-elected in 1996 and 2002. In 2009, he was again re-elected, this time with 95.37 per cent 
of the vote. In the light of these results, some believe that President Obiang is not prepared 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>to relinquish power and prepare for a peaceful political transition. According to information 
received, this perceived lack of possibility of changing government through peaceful 
means, namely through free and fair elections, may have prompted some individuals to turn 
to other means, including assistance from mercenaries, to achieve political change in 
Equatorial Guinea. 
</p>
<p>16. In addition, Equatorial Guinea possesses valuable natural resources that may be 
coveted by third parties. Within a few years of the discovery of vast oil reserves in the 
1990s, Equatorial Guinea became the third-largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa, after 
Nigeria and Angola. Oil companies from the United States of America have invested 
heavily in the country. Nonetheless, the dramatic increase in oil revenues has not resulted in 
a corresponding increase in the living standards of the local population; instead, it has been 
accompanied by a growing number of allegations of corruption against the Government.8 
Most famously, the United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations 
examined the role of Riggs Bank, in which the Government of Equatorial Guinea had 
deposited several hundreds of millions of dollars of oil revenue. The investigation revealed 
that some of the public funds had been misused by members of the Government.9 In this 
regard, the Working Group notes that the recent growth in oil revenues and their misuse 
may have increased the country&#8217;s vulnerability to attack and turned it into an attractive and 
valuable target. Indeed, according to the above-mentioned United States Senate report, 
these funds are not re-invested in public services for the benefit of the general population, 
but are misused by a small group of individuals holding power; anybody who takes power 
in Equatorial Guinea therefore knows that they will also have access to these funds. It 
appears that gaining control over the country&#8217;s oil revenues was the main motivation behind 
the coup attempt in 2004. In this regard, the Working Group was informed that, since 2006, 
the United States Agency for International Development has managed a social development 
fund in the country, totally financed by the Government of Equatorial Guinea, for the 
implementation of projects in the areas of health, education, women&#8217;s affairs and the 
environment. 
</p>
<p>17. Since 1979, there have been many reported coup attempts in Equatorial Guinea. It is 
unclear how many were real and how many were simply alleged by the authorities, partly 
as a pretext to crack down on the political opposition.10 Indeed, there have been reports that 
allegations by the Government of coup attempts and other attacks have been promptly 
followed by arrests of political opponents.11 The great majority of these reported coup 
attempts do not actually involve mercenaries: for instance, during the visit of the Working 
Group, several officials referred to the attack on the banks that took place in Bata in 2007 
as a &#8220;mercenary incident&#8221;, but it appears that no mercenaries were actually involved in 
what was essentially an armed robbery. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The attempted coup of March 2004  
</b></p>
<p>18. The attempted coup that took place in March 2004 has been the most widely 
reported incident clearly involving mercenaries, some of whom were current or former 
</p>

</p>
<p>employees of private military and security companies from several other countries.12 The 
plot was uncovered by several intelligence services, and arrests were made before the coup 
could take place. On 7 March 2004, Simon Mann, a British national, and 69 other men were 
arrested at Harare International Airport in Zimbabwe. They were on board a Boeing plane 
full of weapons to be taken to Malabo. On 8 March 2004, another group of 15 men, 
including 8 South Africans (among whom Nick du Toit), 6 Armenians and Gerhard Merz, a 
German,13 were arrested in Malabo. 
</p>
<p>19. It remains unclear who exactly commissioned the men to take part in the coup 
attempt and who funded the entire operation. The Government of Equatorial Guinea claims 
that the mercenaries had been hired by Severo Moto, the leader of the Party for Progress of 
Equatorial Guinea and currently exiled in Spain, in an effort to overthrow President Obiang. 
Severo Moto himself claimed several years later that he had hired Simon Mann to help to 
achieve political change in Equatorial Guinea. 14  Many people were alleged to have 
participated in the funding of the coup attempt, including Ely Calil, a British businessman 
of Lebanese origin, and Mark Thatcher, son of the former Prime Minister of the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. To date, Ely Calil has never been 
questioned about his involvement in the coup attempt. Mark Thatcher, who was residing in 
South Africa at the time of the events, was arrested in Cape Town on 25 August 2004. In 
January 2005, under a plea bargain, he admitted to helping to charter a helicopter that could 
have been used for mercenary activity, and agreed to pay a fine of 3 million Rand. 
</p>
<p>20. The coup attempt in 2004 is a typical case that illustrates the possible close ties 
between mercenaries and certain private military and security companies. Indeed, Simon 
Mann has been involved in Executive Outcomes, a private military and security company 
established in South Africa late in the 1980s. Mr. Mann then went on to establish another 
private military and security company, Sandline International, in 1996. Nick du Toit also 
worked for Executive Outcomes, in Angola and Sierra Leone, in the 1990s.15 In addition, 
Laurens Horne and Jacobus &#8220;Harry&#8221; Carlse, two of the South African men arrested in 
Zimbabwe together with Mr. Mann in March 2004, were part-owners of Meteoric Tactical 
Systems, a company providing security to the Embassy of Switzerland in Baghdad, to Jay 
Garner, the first civilian administrator from the United States in Iraq, and providing training 
to the Iraqi army.16 They had actually taken holiday leave and came directly from Iraq to 
participate in the operation in March 2004.17 Also arrested in Zimbabwe was a former 
employee of Executive Outcomes, Raymond Stanley Archer, who had worked for Steele 
Foundation when President Aristide of Haiti was deposed.18  
</p>
<p>21. Following the failed coup attempt in March 2004, several trials were held in several 
countries. The Working Group was informed that some of these proceedings were still 
ongoing, for instance in Lebanon, Spain and the United Kingdom. The present report 
focuses on the trials held in Equatorial Guinea.

<p>22. The trial of Nick du Toit and his accomplices began in Malabo on 23 August 2004. 
However, on 31 August 2004, proceedings were suspended in the hope that more evidence 
would be revealed in the civil proceedings brought in England by the Government of 
Equatorial Guinea against several British businessmen accused of financing the coup. 
When it became clear that such evidence was not forthcoming, the trial in Malabo resumed 
on 16 November 2004, when the Attorney General presented cases against 12 additional 
individuals to be tried in absentia, including Severo Moto.  
</p>
<p>23. On 26 November 2004, three South Africans and three citizens of Equatorial Guinea 
were acquitted. Those tried in absentia were convicted of attempted treason and conspiracy 
to commit crimes against the Head of State and against the form of government. The 
remaining defendants were found guilty of attempting to commit crimes against the Head of 
State and against the form of government, or being accomplices in such attempts. They 
received prison sentences of between 16 months and 62 years. Those tried in absentia 
remain abroad.  
</p>
<p>24. It should be noted that a number of reports indicated that the above trial failed to 
comply with international human rights standards and that some of the defendants had been 
subjected to torture and ill-treatment.19 The defendants were reportedly regularly beaten and 
tortured during interrogation in order to extract confessions from them. One of the 
defendants, Gehard Merz, a German national, died in Black Beach Prison on 17 March 
</p><p>2004. It has been alleged that he died as a result of the torture he was subjected to since his 
arrest a few days earlier.20  The Working Group addressed letters to the authorities of 
Equatorial Guinea on 2 June 2005 and 8 March 2006 to express its concern at the reported 
situation in prison of the alleged mercenaries convicted in 2004 of attempting to overthrow 
the Government, and related allegations of torture and mistreatment.21 To date, the Working 
Group has not received any reply to its letters. During its visit, the Working Group did not 
receive information on these allegations. During his visit in November 2008, the Special 
Rapporteur on torture was able to visit some of the detainees who had been arrested in 
March 2004 and who reported that they had been tortured during their interrogation.22  
</p>
<p>25. Simon Mann and his accomplices, who were arrested in Zimbabwe, were tried there 
and found guilty of arms smuggling on 22 July 2004. After serving their prison sentence in 
Zimbabwe, most of them were released in May 2005 and returned to South Africa, where 
some were prosecuted under the Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act of 1998. 
Mr. Mann was extradited from Zimbabwe to Equatorial Guinea on 2 February 2008 and 
detained in Black Beach Prison. While in detention, he reported that he had been well 
treated because he had agreed to cooperate with the authorities from the start, whereas the 
other prisoners who had refused to cooperate were held in much worse conditions.23  
</p>
<p>26. Mr. Mann and Mohamed Salam, the Lebanese businessman, were tried in June 2008 
in Malabo. Six nationals of Equatorial Guinea were also tried in the same trial, although 
they seemed completely unrelated to Mr. Mann and Mr. Salam. Again, there were reports 
that some of the defendants had been beaten while in police custody and not given access to 
their families or to a lawyer until five days before the trial. Some defendants were allegedly 
forced to sign statements. In court, the nationals of Equatorial Guinea retracted their 
statements on the grounds that they had been made under duress and torture. However, the 
court did not examine the allegations of coercion and allowed the statements to be admitted

<p>as evidence. Furthermore, in the summing up at the end of the trial, the Attorney General 
requested an additional 20 years to be added to their sentences for their failure to 
collaborate with the administration of justice by stating in court that they had been forced to 
sign statements under duress.24 On 7 July 2008, Mr. Mann was sentenced to 34 years of 
imprisonment, Mr. Salam to 18 years, while the others received shorter prison sentences. 
One defendant from Equatorial Guinea was acquitted. 
</p>
<p>27. Mr. Mann and other South African nationals, including Nick du Toit, were pardoned 
on 3 November 2009 by President Obiang. Upon their release, they all returned to their 
respective home countries. The authorities claim that all the foreigners involved in the 
attempted coup had been released. It was recently reported that Mr. Mann has been hired as 
an adviser to President Obiang.25 If this information is correct, such a move would not be in 
accordance with the Government&#8217;s obligation and declared intention to hold mercenaries 
accountable for their activities.  
</p>
<p><b> C.  The armed attack of 17 February 2009  
</b></p>
<p>28. Another incident that is regularly mentioned by the Government of Equatorial 
Guinea as a mercenary-related incident is the armed attack on the presidential palace of 17 
February 2009. The Government claims that, in the early morning of that day, members of 
the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) of Nigeria attacked the 
presidential palace in Malabo with assistance from inside the country. Details about the 
incident and the people involved are scarce. The Working Group has even received 
information that the alleged attack amounted to mere few gun shots. The Movement has 
denied any involvement in the attack. There were reports that some unidentified individuals 
came to attack the presidential palace on speed boats, left promptly and were never caught. 
</p>
<p>29. Following the attack, the authorities arrested a number of Nigerian nationals. Many 
of them were irregular migrants and, as such, were expelled from the country. Some who 
were in a regular situation were released. Seven Nigerian fishermen and traders who were 
arrested on their boat in the territorial waters of Equatorial Guinea remained in custody 
pending their trial. It was reported that the authorities also detained Afiong Etim, the wife 
of one of the fishermen, who allegedly subsequently died from beatings administered 
during interrogation.26 When the Working Group enquired about consular access to the 
Nigerian detainees, it did not receive a clear response. 
</p>
<p>30. The authorities also arrested 10 nationals of Equatorial Guinea who were all 
members of the political party Union Popular (UP). The authorities claimed that the UP 
members had contracted the Nigerian &#8220;mercenaries&#8221; to launch the assault on the 
presidential palace. To this day, the nature of the link between the Nigerian fishermen and 
the UP members remains unclear. The 10 UP members were held in Malabo police station 
for months, and some were allegedly tortured.27 Two of them, Marcelino Nguema and 
Santiago Asumu, were transferred to Black Beach Prison, while the other eight were 
released on bail. The Nigerian fishermen and the two nationals of Equatorial Guinea were 
allegedly detained incommunicado and without charge until October 2009. 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>31. The Working Group received information that, of the Nigerian nationals arrested 
and detained, one woman died in detention before the trial, as mentioned above. It was also 
informed that a second Nigerian national may also have died while in detention, although 
this information was never confirmed by the authorities. Seven Nigerians &#8211; Marck Etim 
Marck, Eyoh Okon Ikara, Eyon Kun John, Effiong Matew, Okokon Iyanam (also known as 
Mintay), Isangadighi Emmanuel and Ekaette Eyo Okon &#8211; were present at the trial. It was 
unclear whether the Nigerian consular authorities were officially informed of their arrests, 
the charges held against them, the status of proceedings or the death of one or possibly two 
of them, and whether they were granted access to them. It should be recalled that, under 
articles 36 and 37 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, to which Equatorial 
Guinea is a party, the authorities were under the obligation to grant the Nigerian consular 
authorities access to its nationals in detention without delay, and to inform them, also 
without delay, of any case of death of its nationals. 
</p>
<p>32. In March 2010, the seven Nigerian fishermen stood trial in Malabo. They were tried 
together with three nationals of Equatorial Guinea: Marcelino Nguema and Santiago 
Asumu, the two UP members arrested in February 2009; and Faustino Ondo Ebang, the 
former UP president, in exile in Spain and therefore tried in absentia. The Nigerian 
fishermen argued in court that they had got lost on their boat because of the fog and ended 
up in the territorial waters of Equatorial Guinea, where they were arrested on 17 February 
</p><p>2009. No weapons were found on the boat or presented in court. The only evidence that 
seems to have been presented in court was weather reports for 16 and 17 February 2009, 
which indicated that visibility was good on those two days and that the Nigerians&#8217; boat 
could not have got lost in fog. Several sources raised serious doubts about the fishermen&#8217;s 
involvement in the attack and the lack of evidence presented at the trial. All defendants 
complained in court of having been subjected to torture while in Black Beach Prison, but 
the claims were not examined.  
</p>
<p>33. On 5 April 2010, the seven Nigerian fishermen were found guilty of attempting to 
assassinate President Obiang on 17 February 2009, and sentenced to 12 years of 
imprisonment. Although the three nationals of Equatorial Guinea were acquitted, both 
Marcelino Nguema and Santiago Asumu remained in custody after the verdict. According 
to information received during the visit, President Obiang was apparently displeased with 
the court decision to acquit the three UP members, which may have explained why they 
remained in custody despite the judgement. The seven Nigerians did appeal against their 
conviction and sentence. On the other hand, the Attorney General appealed the decision to 
acquit the three nationals of Equatorial Guinea. 
</p>
<p>34. In the meantime, according to information received during the visit, four nationals of 
Equatorial Guinea &#8211; Jos&#233; Abeso Nsue Nchama, Manuel Ndong Anseme, Jacinto Mich&#225; 
Obiang, former military officers, and Alipio Ndong Asumu, a civilian &#8211; were detained in 
Black Beach Prison around the end of January 2010. They reportedly confessed that they 
were the ones who had come and fled on the above-mentioned speedboats on 17 February 
</p><p>2009. It remains unclear to the Working Group how and when these four men, who were 
living in Benin for many years, ended up in Black Beach Prison. According to information 
received by the Working Group, the men may have been abducted from Benin by 
Equatorial Guinean security personnel or by mercenaries contracted by the Government. 
When the Working Group requested clarification from the authorities on this matter, it did 
not receive a clear response; the authorities merely claimed that the four men had been 
brought back to Equatorial Guinea with the cooperation of other States. The Working 
Group did not obtain further information on how the four men had been brought back into 
the country. According to information received during the visit, they were not subjected to 
formal extradition procedures.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/32/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>35. It should be noted here that many abductions of high-profile nationals of Equatorial 
Guinea in neighbouring countries and their subsequent transfer to prisons in Equatorial 
Guinea have taken place in the past, often with the assistance of the security forces of those 
countries. Once brought back into the country, they are often held in secret detention.28 In 
the present case, according to interlocutors, the authorities refused to acknowledge their 
presence in Black Beach Prison for several months, despite requests from their families, 
lawyers and diplomats in Malabo. The four men were reportedly tortured and forced to 
confess their involvement in the 17 February 2009 attack on the presidential palace. 
</p>
<p>36. The four men, along with Marcelino Nguema and Santiago Asumu who had been 
acquitted by a civilian court few months earlier as mentioned above, were tried in a military 
court from 14 to 16 August 2010 (therefore over the weekend). The Working Group 
received information that the men were not allowed to be represented by counsel of their 
own choosing. It is unclear to the Working Group why Marcelino Nguema and Santiago 
Asumu were tried for the same facts for a second time. When the Working Group requested 
an explanation, it was told that the two men were tried in a military court this time because 
some of the other defendants who were tried with them were former military officers. The 
Working Group was also informed by the authorities that new evidence against the two 
men had come to light since the trial of April 2010. Again, it is unclear what the link 
between the two UP members and the four men &#8220;repatriated&#8221; from Benin is and why they 
all had to be tried together before a military court. It should be recalled here that the Code 
of Military Justice, which was adopted in Spain on 17 July 1945, allows for summary trials 
to be conducted, with limited due process guarantees.29 
</p>
<p>37. On 21 August 2010, only a few days after a summary military trial at the end of 
which they were found guilty of &#8220;an attack against the Head of State and Government 
representatives, treason and terrorism&#8221;, Jos&#233; Abeso Nsue and Manuel Ndong Anseme, 
Jacinto Mich&#225; Obiang and Alipio Ndong Asumu were sentenced to death, while Marcelino 
Nguema and Santiago Asumu were sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment.  
</p>
<p>38. Within hours of the verdict, the four men were executed. They had no opportunity to 
exercise their right to appeal. The right of appeal was introduced by Judiciary Act No. 
5/2009 of 18 May 2009, which provides that the decisions of military courts may be 
appealed before the Supreme Court.30 Furthermore, they had no opportunity to see their 
families before the executions. Jos&#233; Abeso Nsue reportedly asked to see his family, which 
lives in Malabo, but had already been executed by the time they arrived at Black Beach 
Prison. The bodies of the four men were reportedly not returned to their families, and 
buried on the same day in Malabo cemetery. 
</p>
<p>39. While the Working Group was in Malabo, it insisted in its reiterated requests to visit 
those allegedly involved in the attack of 17 February 2009 and still detained in Black Beach 
Prison. The authorities denied the requests on various grounds. The Working Group was 
told, for instance, that it should not interfere with ongoing investigations by talking to 
defendants. The Working Group also requested to see the relevant judicial decisions, in 
vain. The lack of transparency regarding the trials conducted in April and August 2010, 
despite the repeated requests by the Working Group to have to access judicial decisions and 
to visit the detainees, points to severe shortcomings in the implementation of international 
human rights standards in the administration of justice by the Government of Equatorial 
Guinea. These shortcomings had already been witnessed by the Special Rapporteur on 
torture during his visit in November 2008.31 The Working Group condemns in the strongest 
</p>

<p>terms these executions, which followed a summary trial that clearly lacked due process. It 
also condemns the fact that the sentence was carried out the same day, depriving the 
defendants of any possibility of appeal.  
</p>
<p>40. The Working Group wishes to recall that Equatorial Guinea is a party to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which provides that the death penalty 
can only be applied in a strictly defined set of circumstances. One of these is that the death 
sentence can only be imposed after a trial in which the minimum fair trial standards 
demanded by article 14 of the Covenant have been respected. In the present case, the 
Working Group is concerned that the military trial was not conducted in accordance with 
basic fair trial guarantees, including the prohibition of the use of evidence (including 
confessions) gathered under duress or torture, equality of arms, the provision of competent 
defence counsel and the right not to testify against oneself and confess guilt. In addition, 
article 6 of the Covenant states that no death sentence should be carried out until a final 
judgement has been rendered by a competent court, and that anyone sentenced to death has 
the right to seek pardon or commutation of the sentence. It should also be recalled that a 
delegation from Equatorial Guinea recently informed the Human Rights Council that a 
moratorium on the application of the death penalty had been put in place and that many of 
those condemned to capital punishment have been reprieved or had their sentences 
commuted.32 
</p>
<p>41. On 6 October 2010, President Obiang signed Decree No. 79/2010, whereby he 
pardoned, among others, the seven Nigerians who had been sentenced to 12 years of 
imprisonment in April 2010, and Marcelino Nguema and Santiago Asumu, who had been 
sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment in August 2010. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Legislative framework 
</b></p>
<p>42. As mentioned above, no law in Equatorial Guinea deals specifically with 
mercenaries, and mercenarism does not exist as a crime in national law. Most of the alleged 
mercenaries arrested after the attempted coup of 2004 and the attack on the presidential 
palace in 2009 were mainly charged with crimes pertaining to State security and defined in 
the Penal Code. Many were charged with treason (article 121, paragraph 3, and article 124 
of the Penal Code), crimes against the Head of State (article 142 of the Penal Code) and/or 
crimes against the form of government (article 163 of the Penal Code).33 During the visit, 
the Working Group was informed that the Government was contemplating the possibility of 
introducing a new provision in the Penal Code to address the crime of mercenarism, but no 
further details were provided. 
</p>
<p>43. While Equatorial Guinea is not a party to the International Convention against the 
Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries, the Working Group was 
informed that all conventions that had not yet been ratified by the State were being studied 
by Parliament. No further details were provided. 
</p>
<p>44. During the visit, several references were made to a regional arrangement in the Gulf 
of Guinea on security issues. The Gulf of Guinea Commission treaty was signed in 
February 2001 by Angola, Cameroon, the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Nigeria and Sao Tome and Principe. The treaty covers conflict 
resolution, socio-economic prosperity, environmental protection and maritime security in 
the Gulf of Guinea. The organization was officially launched in 2006 and is based in 
Angola. The treaty does not address explicitly the issue of mercenaries. 
</p>

<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Private military and security companies  
</b></p>
<p>45. The Working Group notes that there is at least one United States-based private 
military and security company, Military Professional Resources Initiatives (MPRI), in 
Equatorial Guinea. MPRI is part of the L-3 Communications group. The company was 
reportedly asked by the Government of Equatorial Guinea in 1998 to assess its defence 
systems, in particular its need to protect its oil reserves. In order to respond to that request, 
MPRI needed a licence from the United States State Department, which was refused at the 
time. A licence was eventually granted to MPRI by the State Department, allegedly because 
the company offered to provide human rights training in Equatorial Guinea.34 
</p>
<p>46. According to representatives from MPRI, the company is contracted by the 
Government of Equatorial Guinea to provide training to the armed forces and the police, 
including human rights training, and advice to the Government on legislative reform. 
According to the Government, the training, which started in 2007, has included &#8220;instruction 
on appropriate human rights practices&#8221;. 35  MPRI reportedly does not take part in any 
operations alongside the police or the armed forces, and does not provide training in 
firearms. Following the rise in piracy in the Gulf of Guinea in recent years, MPRI was also 
awarded a $250 million contract to ensure the country&#8217;s maritime security. MPRI has 
improved coastal security by increased radar surveillance. The two main operations centres 
are located in Malabo and Bata. The Working Group was also informed that Israeli private 
military employees were protecting vessels from Equatorial Guinea. 
</p>
<p>47. While the Working Group can only welcome the provision of human rights training, 
it recommends that the Government request an independent evaluation of the training 
programme to assess its actual impact on the conduct of the armed forces and the police. 
The Working Group is not aware of any allegations of human rights violations committed 
by MPRI. In its visit to Punta Europa, the Working Group came across other private 
security companies in charge of the protection of oil infrastructures.  
</p>
<p>48. In view of the possible increase in the number of private military and security 
companies operating in Equatorial Guinea, the Working Group recommends that the 
Government envisage the adoption of legislation on such companies accordingly. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>49.<b> The Working Group reiterates its appreciation to the Government of 
Equatorial Guinea for extending to the Working Group an invitation to discuss the 
measures taken by the Government to address the phenomenon of mercenaries. 
During the visit, the Working Group had the opportunity to assess the geopolitical 
situation of Equatorial Guinea, a country with important natural resources, which has 
allegedly experienced several attempted coups involving organized groups, including 
mercenaries.  
</b></p>
<p>50.<b> The Working Group found that the coup attempted in 2004 illustrates the 
possible close and disturbing links between mercenaries and some private military 
and security companies. Employees of such companies are not all mercenaries. 
Nonetheless, with regard to the coup attempt in 2004, the Working Group cannot but

<p><b>observe that many of the individuals involved had had or still had close links with 
private military and security companies. 
</b></p>
<p>51.<b> The Working Group recalls that using international private military and 
security companies to provide oil infrastructures with protection may have an impact 
on the Government&#8217;s control over natural resources. 36  Recourse to international 
private military and security companies to secure maritime borders may also have 
serious implications for national security. Indeed, it may further weaken the State&#8217;s 
ability to control its borders and natural resources, and hence its ability to ensure its 
security.37 
</b></p>
<p>52.<b> The Working Group regrets the lack of transparency by the authorities and the 
lack of cooperation extended to the Working Group during its visit. Most notably, the 
Working Group requested on several occasions to have access to those allegedly 
involved in the armed attack on the presidential palace of 17 February 2009 and to all 
relevant judicial decisions concerning them, but its requests were denied. In this 
regard, the Working Group recommends that the Government provide full 
information in a transparent manner regarding the attack and, in particular, that all 
judgements rendered in the criminal cases relating to the attack be made available to 
the public, in accordance with article 14(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, to which Equatorial Guinea is a party. 
</b></p>
<p>53.<b> The Working Group also urges the Government to provide explanations as to 
how the four men on trial for their alleged involvement in the attack of 17 February 
2009, namely Jos&#233; Abeso Nsue, Manuel Ndong Anseme, Alipio Ndong Asumu and 
Jacinto Mich&#225; Obiang, were brought back from Benin to Equatorial Guinea. The 
Working Group condemns in the strongest terms their execution, which followed a 
summary trial that clearly lacked  due process and were carried out so promptly as to 
deny the four men any possibility of appeal. The Working Group recommends that 
the Government ensure that anyone accused of involvement in a mercenary-related 
incident be tried by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal and in 
compliance with international human rights standards, including with regard to the 
application of the death penalty. In this regard, the Working Group recommends that 
the Government consider abolishing the death penalty or at least imposing a 
moratorium on executions, and acceding to the second Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</b></p>
<p>54.<b> With regard to the Nigerian fishermen arrested immediately after the  armed 
attack on the presidential palace on 17 February 2009, the Working Group regrets the 
lack of information on the death of one or possibly two of them during their detention. 
The Working Group urges the Government to provide full information on any 
investigations carried out into the circumstances leading to these deaths. 
</b></p>
<p>55.<b> With regard to the failed coup attempt of 2004, the Working Group urges the 
Government to respond to its communications of 2 June 2005 and 8 March 2006, in 
which it expressed its concerns about the reported situation in prison of the alleged 
mercenaries convicted in 2004 of attempting to overthrow the Government of 
Equatorial Guinea, and related allegations of torture and mistreatment. 
</b></p>
<p>56.<b> The Working Group recommends that the Government consider developing 
national legislation to criminalize mercenarism and mercenary-related acts. In this 
context, the Working Group recommends that the Penal Code be revised and updated

The Working Group also recommends that the Government consider acceding to the 
International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of 
Mercenaries as a matter of priority. 
</b></p>
<p>57.<b> The Working Group recalls that all mercenaries should be held accountable for 
their actions. Accordingly, the Working Group recommends that anyone who is 
accused of involvement in a mercenary-related incident be tried by a competent, 
independent and impartial tribunal and in compliance with international human 
rights standards. The Working Group also recommends that anyone who is accused of 
involvement in a mercenary-related incident be treated in accordance with 
international human rights standards, in particular the prohibition of torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
</b></p>
<p>58.<b> The Working Group believes that the Government could reduce its 
vulnerability to mercenary attacks by promoting and strengthening democracy, 
economic, social and cultural rights and development in general, as well as good 
governance. In this regard, the Working Group calls on the Government to ensure 
free political participation, the independence of the judiciary, and transparent and 
efficient administration of justice.  
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>With regard to private military and security companies, the Working Group 
recommends that the Government evaluate the need for their use for army or police 
training and the actual impact of the current training programme on the conduct of 
the armed forces and the police. In addition, it recommends that the Government
