2.      
The transfer of leave to the Plaintiff has been consented by the Director of Lands on 06/08/13.

5.      
When giving the consent, the Plaintiff told that he fully understood the nature and consequence of his consent. I explained that he cannot change his consent afterwards. He then reconfirmed his consent to transfer the property to the Plaintiff.

The Plaintiff also agreed to deposit the sum of $57,000.00 into the Defendant's bank account (account number to be given by the defendant) upon execution.
