<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present document is submitted by the Special Rapporteur on contemporary 
forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Mr. Mutuma 
Ruteere, to the Human Rights Council, pursuant to resolutions 5/1 and 16/33 of the Human 
Rights Council. The document provides observations on the communications on specific 
cases addressed by the Special Rapporteur and his predecessor to States, as well as on the 
replies by States received. 
</p>
<p>2. The cases, raised by the Special Rapporteur and his predecessor in this addendum, 
include communications sent between 1 March 2011 and 15 March 2012. 
</p>
<p>3. The addendum contains observations on the replies received from States between 1 
May 2011 and 15 May 2012. The responses by States refer to cases raised by the Special 
Rapporteur and his predecessor during the period between March 2011 and March 2012; 
however some of the responses are related to cases addressed by his predecessor in earlier 
reporting periods. These communications are marked with a footnote in the text.  Replies to 
communication which were received by the Special Rapporteur after 15 May 2012 will be 
reflected in his next communications report. 
</p>
<p>4. For ease of reference, cases have been grouped by country, with countries listed 
alphabetically according to their names in English. Each communication is referenced in 
one of four categories: urgent appeal (UA), allegation letter (AL), joint urgent appeal (JUA) 
and joint allegation letter (JAL). This is followed by the date the communication was 
issued, as well as the case number and the State reply. The electronic version of the present 
document has both of these items hyperlinked, and clicking on them will open the 
communication sent and the reply from the concerned State, respectively, as uploaded on 
the OHCHR website. The relevant communications reports of Special procedures, which 
contain the communications sent and the replies received from States during the period 
under review, are cited in footnotes. Finally, in bold, is a summary of the allegations 
contained in the communication in the language of submission. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to all States which have transmitted responses to 
communications sent. He considers response to his communications an important part of 
cooperation by States with his mandate. The Special Rapporteur urges those States which 
have not yet responded to do so at their earliest convenience as he remains interested in 
receiving updated information on the issues raised in his communications.

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to the communication sent during the reporting 
period regarding the alleged threat of forced eviction against Roma community in Sofia 
district. The Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned about the situation of the Roma 
community who reportedly have not been offered alternative housing.  In this connection,

<p>he wishes to refer the Government of Bulgaria, to article 5 of the International Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which obliges States &#8220;to prohibit 
and to eliminate racial discrimination in all of its forms and to guarantee the right of 
everyone, without distinction as to race, colour or national or ethnic origin, to equality 
before the law, notably in the enjoyment of [...] the right to housing&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur would also like to refer to the General Recommendation No. 
27 of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, which recommends that 
States &#8220;develop and implement policies and projects aimed at avoiding segregation of 
</p>
<p>Roma communities in housing; involve Roma communities and associations as partners 
together with other persons in housing project construction, rehabilitation and maintenance; 
act firmly against any discriminatory practices affecting Roma, mainly by local authorities 
and private owners, with regard to taking up residence and access to housing; act firmly 
against local measures denying residence to and unlawful expulsion of Roma, and refrain 
from placing Roma in camps outside populated areas that are isolated and without access to 
health care and other facilities&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>9.  The Special Rapporteur also encourages the Government of Bulgaria to enhance its 
efforts in the implementation of the Concluding Observations of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD), adopted on 3 March 2009, which 
recommends that &#8220;the State party continue taking positive measures to improve living 
conditions of Roma in respect of access to work, health care, housing and education within 
the framework of the Plan of Action for Roma Inclusion and the Decade for Roma 
Inclusion, in accordance with article 5 of the International Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and General Recommendation XXVII (2000) on 
discrimination against Roma adopted by CERD in 2000&#8221;.2

efforts to implement the Concluding Observations of the Committee on the Elimination of

that &#8220;the State party develop and implement policies and projects aimed at avoiding 
</p>
<p>segregation of Roma communities in housing, to involve Roma communities and 
associations as partners together with other persons in housing project construction, 
rehabilitation and maintenance, and [&#8230;] act firmly against local measures denying

</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Italy for the response provided 
with regard to the communication concerning the allegedly racially motivated killing of two 
Senegalese migrants in Florence. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the steps undertaken 
by the Government to investigate these killings. He urges the Government of Italy to

discrimination and xenophobia, and strengthen mutual understanding and the respect for 
multiculturalism and diversity among ethnic and racial communities. 
</p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur also encourages the Government of Italy to take possible 
preventive measures to address the concerns expressed with regard to the current disturbing 
dynamic of xenophobia and extreme manifestations of racism in the country, which mainly 
affect migrants and asylum seekers, primarily those of African descent.

<p>20. With regard to the concerns expressed about the alleged unfairness of trials and the 
unequal treatment in the administration of justice, the Special Rapporteur would like to 
refer the Government of Kyrgyzstan to the provisions of article 5 of the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), which 
requires State Parties [&#8230;] to guarantee the right of everyone, without distinction to race,

Government of Nigeria had not transmitted a reply to the communication sent during the

</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Thailand for the detailed response 
received to the communications sent during the reporting period. The Special Rapporteur 
has been concerned about the significant number of reports on the situation of human rights 
of migrant workers in Thailand due to the impacts of the nationality verification process. 
He welcomes the efforts undertaken by the Government of Thailand to improve the 
situation of migrant workers, simplify the process of nationality verification, ensure the 
basic rights of migrant workers, improve the access to health services, provide sufficient 
information to affected individuals about the process and disseminate relevant information 
on the rights of migrant workers and responsibilities of employers.  
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur would like to encourage the Government of Thailand to 
continue its efforts to ensure better coordination among relevant state agencies to avoid 
mistreatment of migrant workers in particular by law enforcement agencies, provide 
adequate protection in terms of work safety and equal remuneration, as well as to ensure 
equal access to health services and access to justice.  
</p>
<p>36. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur wishes to refer the Government of 
Thailand to the principle of equality and non-discrimination, provided in the article 2 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which applies to all 
individuals within the territory, regardless of their citizenship, nationality and immigration 
status. Furthermore, he would like to refer to article 5 of the International Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which requires that States undertake

</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur also wishes to refer to paragraph 29 of the General

Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination recommends that States &#8220;remove 
</p>
<p>obstacles that prevent the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights by non-citizens, 
notably in the areas of education, housing, employment and health.  Also, he deems it 
appropriate to refer to paragraph 33 which recommends that State party &#8220;[&#8230;] take measures 
</p>
<p>to eliminate discrimination against non-citizens in relation to working conditions and work 
requirements, including employment rules and practices with discriminatory purposes or 
effects&#8221; and to paragraph 35 which provides that &#8220;all individuals are entitled to the

</b></p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the United States of America for 
the response to the communication regarding the act of burning the copy of Qur&#8217;an by 
</p>
<p>church members of the Dove World Outreach Centre in Gainesville, Florida in March 2011.  
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur recognizes the strong condemnations expressed by the 
Government regarding this action. He encourages the Government of the United States of 
America to continue its efforts against intolerance and discrimination. The Special 
Rapporteur expressed his concern about the negative impact of such acts that incite 
intolerance and discrimination upon the interaction, harmony and respect for tolerance and 
diversity among ethnic, cultural and religious communities. In this regard, he would like to 
refer to paragraph 106 of the Durban Review Conference Outcome Document which 
&#8220;reaffirms that the eradication of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
</p>
<p>intolerance should aim not only at promoting equality and eliminating discrimination but 
also at promoting interaction, social harmony and integration, respect for tolerance and 
diversity among ethnic, cultural and religious communities&#8221;.
