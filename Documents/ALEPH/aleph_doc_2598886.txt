Description 
  Unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet of Earthstone Energy, Inc. as of March 31, 2016, and

ended December 31, 2015 and the three months ended March 31, 2016.
EXHIBIT 99.1
UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR EARTHSTONE ENERGY, INC.
Earthstone  Energy,  Inc.  (“Earthstone”  or  the  “Company”)  and  1058286  B.C.  Ltd.,  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  Earthstone 
(“Earthstone Acquisition”) with Lynden Energy Corp. (“Lynden”) entered into an Arrangement Agreement dated as of December 16, 
2015, as amended (the “Arrangement Agreement”), providing for the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of 
Lynden  by  Earthstone  Acquisition  and  the  amalgamation  of  Earthstone  Acquisition  and  Lynden,  with  Lynden  surviving  the 
amalgamation  as  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  Earthstone  (the  “Arrangement”)  as  part  of  a  plan  of  arrangement  (the  “Plan  of 
Arrangement”). The acquisition was effected through an arrangement instead of a merger, because Lynden is incorporated in British 
Columbia, Canada.
On May 18, 2016, pursuant to the Arrangement Agreement and Plan of Arrangement, at the effective time of the Arrangement (the 
“Effective Time”), Earthstone Acquisition acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Lynden (“Lynden Common 
Stock”), and Lynden and Earthstone Acquisition amalgamated into a single corporate entity with Lynden surviving the amalgamation 
as a wholly owned subsidiary of Earthstone. At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of Lynden Common Stock, other than any 
Lynden Common Stock held by Earthstone or Earthstone Acquisition, was, and was deemed to be, transferred by the holder thereof to 
Earthstone Acquisition in exchange for 0.02842 shares of Earthstone common stock, $0.001 par value per share (“Earthstone Common 
Stock”). No fractional shares of Earthstone Common Stock were issued. Where the aggregate number of shares of Earthstone Common 
Stock issued to a Lynden shareholder as consideration would have resulted in a fraction of shares of Earthstone Common Stock being 
issued, the number of shares of Earthstone Common Stock received by such Lynden shareholder was rounded to the nearest whole share 
of Earthstone Common Stock (with fractions equal or greater than 0.5 being rounded up). As a result of the Arrangement, Earthstone 
issued 3,700,279 shares of Earthstone Common Stock. Because the Lynden option holders were not entitled to receive any shares of 
Earthstone Common Stock at closing based upon the method of calculation provided in the Arrangement, Earthstone Acquisition paid 
the Lynden option holders U.S. $0.001 for every Lynden option. As a result of the Arrangement, Earthstone Acquisition paid the Lynden 
option holders an aggregate of U.S. $4,010 at the Effective Time for all outstanding Lynden options.
The common stock of Earthstone is listed on the NYSE MKT, LLC under the symbol “ESTE” and the common stock of Lynden was 
listed on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol “LVL.” Based on the closing sale price for Earthstone common stock on May 18, 
2016, the date of the closing of the Arrangement, the 0.02842 exchange ratio represented approximately $0.35 in value for each share 
of Lynden Common Stock.
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial information is derived from the historical consolidated 
financial statements of Earthstone and Lynden, and has been adjusted to reflect the acquisition of Lynden by Earthstone. Certain of 
Lynden’s historical amounts have been reclassified to conform to Earthstone’s financial statement presentation. The unaudited pro forma 
condensed combined balance sheet as of March 31, 2016 gives effect to the Arrangement as if it had occurred on March 31, 2016. The 
unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and the year ended 
December 31, 2015 gives effect to the Arrangement as if it had occurred on January 1, 2015.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflect pro forma adjustments based on available information and 
certain assumptions that Earthstone believes are reasonable which include the following:
 
 



Earthstone’s acquisition of Lynden is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.  
Borrowings under Earthstone’s credit facility are used to repay all of the debt outstanding under Lynden’s credit facility.  
Liabilities are recognized for transaction related costs and severance costs and other change of controls payments for certain 
Lynden executives and employees.  
Depreciation, depletion & amortization and accretion expense is adjusted due to the fair value adjustments to oil and natural 
gas properties and asset retirement obligations in connection with the Arrangement.  
Estimated tax impacts of the pro forma adjustments.
Assumptions and estimates underlying the pro forma adjustments are more fully described in the accompanying notes, which should be 
read in conjunction with the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements.
F-5
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not purport to represent what Earthstone’s financial position 
or results of operations would have been had the Arrangement actually been consummated on the assumed dates nor are they indicative 
of future financial position or results of operations. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not reflect 
future events that may occur after the Arrangement, including, but not limited to, the anticipated realization of ongoing savings from 
operating efficiencies. These unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been derived from and should be read 
in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained in the Earthstone Annual Report 
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, the 
audited financial statements of Lynden contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2015 and the unaudited 
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended December 31, 2014, December 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016.
The assets and liabilities of Lynden are recorded at their preliminary estimated fair values, with the excess of the purchase price over 
the sum of these fair values recorded as goodwill. The adjustments to Earthstone’s consolidated financial statements in connection with 
the Arrangement, and allocation of the purchase price paid in the transaction are based on a number of factors, including additional 
financial  information  available  at  such  time,  and  the  final  allocation  of  transaction  consideration  and  the  effects  on  the  results  of 
operations may differ materially from the preliminary allocation and unaudited pro forma condensed combined amounts included herein.
Below  is  the  unaudited  pro  forma  condensed  combined  financial  information  and  related  notes  thereto  which  give  effect  to  the 
Arrangement. The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information sets forth:
(i)
Pro forma adjustments giving effect to the Arrangement as if such transaction had been completed on January 1, 2015, the 
beginning  of  the  earliest  period  presented,  for  purposes  of  the  unaudited  pro  forma  condensed  combined  consolidated 
statements of operations. The pro forma adjustments made are (1) directly attributable to the Arrangement, (2) factually 
supportable, and (3) expected to have a continuing impact on the consolidated results.
(ii)  Earthstone and Lynden have different fiscal year ends, are on December 31 and June 30, respectively.

the unaudited historical condensed consolidated balance sheet of Earthstone as of March 31, 2016.

Lynden for the three months ended March 31, 2016; and  
the unaudited historical condensed consolidated statement of operations of Earthstone for the three months ended March 31, 
2016.


The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 has been derived from:

the unaudited historical condensed consolidated interim statement of income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) of 
Lynden for the six months ended December 31, 2014; and

year ended June 30, 2015; and  
the audited historical consolidated statement of operations of Earthstone for the year ended December 31, 2015.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 
(in thousands, except share and per share data)
See accompanying Notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements
F-9
EARTHSTONE ENERGY INC.
NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1.  Basis of Presentation 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflect pro forma adjustments that are described in the accompanying 
notes and are based on available information and certain assumptions that Earthstone believes are reasonable, however, actual results 
may differ from those reflected in these statements. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements do not purport to represent 
what the Earthstone’s financial position or results of operations would have been if the Arrangement had actually occurred on the dates 
indicated above, nor are they indicative of Earthstone’s future financial position or results of operations. These unaudited pro forma 
condensed combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and related 
notes of Earthstone and Lynden for the periods presented.
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)’s Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 
805”), requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values, as determined in 
accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements, as of the acquisition date. In addition, the applicable accounting literature requires 
that consideration transferred be measured at the closing date of the asset acquisition, which may be different than the amount of 
consideration assumed in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial information.
Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be recorded as of the completion of the 
acquisition, primarily at their respective fair values and added to those of Earthstone. The results of operations of Lynden will be reflected 
in  the  financial  statements  and  reported  results  of  operations  of  Earthstone  from  the  date  of  acquisition  but  Earthstone’s  financial 
statements will not be retroactively restated to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of Lynden.
Note 2. Accounting Policies and Presentation  
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of March 31, 2016 and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined 
statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015 have been compiled in a 
manner consistent with the accounting policies adopted by Earthstone. Certain reclassifications and adjustments have been made to 
Lynden’s historical financial information presented herein to conform to Earthstone’s historical presentation.
Reclassifications  were  made  to  the  historical  Lynden  assets  and  liabilities  to  conform  to  Earthstone’s  presentation.  Those 
reclassifications did not impact the total historical Lynden assets or liabilities.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 3.  Purchase Price Allocation 
The preliminary allocation of the total purchase price is based upon management’s estimates of and assumptions related to the fair value 
of assets to be acquired and liabilities to be assumed as of March 31, 2016 using currently available information. Due to the fact that the 
unaudited  pro  forma  condensed  combined  financial  information  has  been  prepared  based  on  these  preliminary  estimates,  the  final 
purchase price allocation and the resulting effect on financial position and results of operations may differ significantly from the pro 
forma amounts included herein.
The preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to change due to several factors, including but not limited to changes in the estimated 
fair value of Lynden’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the Arrangement, which could result from changes in 
future oil and natural gas commodity prices, reserve estimates, interest rates, as well as other factors.
The preliminary consideration to be transferred, fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and resulting goodwill us as follows 
(in thousands, except stock price):
Consideration:
Shares of Earthstone Common Stock issued in the Arrangement to Lynden's stockholders 
Shares of Earthstone Common Stock issued in the Arrangement to Lynden's options holders 
Total Earthstone Common Stock to be issued 
Earthstone Common Stock price as of May 18, 2016

Goodwill (3)
(1)  Based on the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, consideration paid by Earthstone at closing consisted of approximately 
3,700,000 shares of Earthstone Common Stock. The total purchase price is based upon the fair value of the common stock 
which was determined using the closing price of $12.35 per share of common stock on May 18, 2016, and the number of 
shares of Earthstone Common Stock issued.
(2)  Weighted average commodity prices utilized in the determination of the pro forma fair value of natural gas and oil properties 
was $3.68 per Mcf of natural gas, $19.34 per barrel of oil equivalent for NGLs and $64.73 per barrel of oil, before adjustment 
for transportation fees and regional price differentials. The prices used were based upon commodity strip prices for the first 
four years and escalated for inflation at a rate of 2.1% annually beginning with the fifth year through the end of production.  
(3)  Goodwill  was  determined  as  the  excess  consideration  exchanged  over  the  fair  value  of  the  Earthstone’s  net  assets  on 
March 31, 2016. Goodwill reflects the anticipated benefits of the Arrangement that are in addition to the fair value of the 
individual  assets  and  liabilities  described  above.  The  benefits  would  include  expanded  growth  and  diversification  in 
established North American basins while giving the combined company greater scale, efficiency and market visibility. 
Goodwill is not amortized but instead reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any goodwill ultimately recognized in the 
Arrangement is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

Note 4.  Adjustments to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet  
The following adjustments were made in the preparation of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet:
EARTHSTONE ENERGY INC.
(a)  Adjustments  to  reflect  the  elimination  of  Common  Stock,  Additional  Paid-in  Capital,  Accumulated  Deficit,  and 
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income of Lynden, the value of consideration paid by Earthstone in the Arrangement 
and to adjust, where required, the historical book values of Lynden’s assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2016 to fair value, 
in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting.
(b)  Adjustments to reflect the accrual of approximately $0.6 million in accounting, legal, advisory fees and other expenses 
directly related to the transaction and $1.1 million of severance payments that were not reflected in Earthstone’s or Lynden’s 
historical consolidated financial statements.
(c)  Adjustment to reflect assumed borrowings under Earthstone’s credit facility used to repay all of the debt outstanding under 
Lynden’s credit facility. The assumed borrowings have been classified as long-term, reflecting Earthstone’s intent and 
ability to refinance this short-term debt on a long-term basis.
(d)  Adjustments to reflect the change in long-term deferred tax liabilities that represent the book to tax basis difference in 
Lynden’s oil and gas properties and the partial release of Earthstone’s deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Earthstone 
has determined that Lynden’s deferred tax liabilities related to the Arrangement provide sufficient taxable income to realize 
a portion of Earthstone’s deferred tax assets.  Lynden’s deferred tax liabilities are netted against Earthstone’s deferred tax 
assets which have a valuation allowance to reduce its overall net deferred tax assets to zero. The combined condensed 
consolidated  balance  sheet  reflects  zero  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  The  impact  of  the  release  of  the  valuation 
allowance  was  not  included  in  the  three  months  ended  March  31,  2016  unaudited  pro  forma  condensed  combined 
consolidated statement of operations because it will not have a continuing impact.
(e)  Adjustment to asset retirement obligations due to the fair value adjustments as a result of applying the acquisition method
of accounting.
Note 5. Adjustments to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Operations  
The following adjustments were made in the preparation of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations:
(f)  Adjustments to reflect the decreased depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense that would have been recorded with
respect to Lynden’s properties, had the Arrangement occurred on January 1, 2015.
(g)  Adjustment to reflect the estimated incremental income tax benefit (expense) associated with the pro forma adjustments 
assuming all of the combined company’s earnings had been subject to federal income tax using an effective tax rate of 
approximately 34.5%. This rate is inclusive of federal and state income taxes.
(h)  Adjustments to reflect additional accretion expense that would have been recorded with respect to Lynden’s properties, had
the Arrangement occurred on January 1, 2015.
(i)  Adjustments to reflect the difference in interest expense that would have been recorded with respect to Lynden’s debt, had
the Arrangement occurred on January 1, 2015.
(j)  Adjustments to reflect the elimination of approximately $0.9 million and $0.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 
2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively, in non-recurring transaction costs that are directly related to the 
Arrangement and are not expected to have a continuing impact.
