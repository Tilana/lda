</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 2005/84, the Commission on Human Rights expressed its concern at the 
increasing number of people living with HIV, in particular the situation of women, girls, and 
children in general and groups vulnerable to infection and discrimination. The Commission 
emphasized the need for intensified efforts to ensure universal respect for and observance of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, so as to reduce vulnerability to HIV/AIDS, to 
prevent HIV/AIDS-related discrimination and stigma, and to reduce the impact of HIV/AIDS. 
To this end, the Commission invited States, United Nations bodies, programmes and specialized 
agencies and international and non-governmental organizations to continue to take all necessary 
steps to ensure the respect, protection and fulfilment of HIV/AIDS-related human rights, as 
contained in the guidelines on HIV/AIDS and human rights,<b>3</b> and called on States to 
implement in full the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS adopted at the twenty-sixth 
special session of the General Assembly on HIV/AIDS in 2001.<b>4</b> The Commission requested the 
Secretary-General to solicit comments from Governments, United Nations bodies, programmes 
and specialized agencies and international and non-governmental organizations on steps they 
have taken to promote and implement, where applicable, programmes to address the urgent 
HIV-related human rights of women, children and vulnerable groups in the context of 
prevention, care and access to treatment, as described in the guidelines and resolution 2005/84, 
and to submit, in consultation with interested parties, a progress report to the Commission 
for consideration at its sixty-third session. In accordance with Human Rights Council 
decision 2/102, this report is being submitted to the tenth session of the Council. 
</p>
<p>2. The present report summarizes replies received from 21 Governments, 9 international 
organizations and 8 non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The replies were voluminous and 
this report provides only a summary of the information received. The full texts of replies are 
available at the secretariat for consultation. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  CONTRIBUTIONS FROM STATES 
</b></p>
<p>3. The Government of Australia provided information on its National HIV/AIDS Strategy 
for 2005-2008 which aims to reduce the number of new infections nationally through health 
promotion, harm minimization, education and improved awareness of transmission and trends in 
infection; improve the overall health and well-being of people living with HIV through equitable 
access to treatments and improved continuum of care in health and human services; reduce 
HIV-related discrimination that impacts upon people living with HIV and affected communities 
in Australia; and develop and strengthen links with other related national initiatives. Australia 
also has a Disability Discrimination Act 1992 that makes it unlawful to discriminate against 
persons with disabilities and disability is broadly defined to include people living with HIV and 
AIDS. Similarly, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 provides that it is unlawful for a person or an 
organization to discriminate against a person on the basis of sex in a range of areas. Under both 
these acts, direct and indirect discrimination is recognized and complaints can be lodged with the 
</p>

</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  General Assembly resolution S-26/2. </p>

 <p>  
</p>
<p>Australian Human Rights Commission. In terms of international development assistance, 
Australia has an HIV strategy entitled &#8220;Meeting the Challenge (2004)&#8221; which recognizes that 
addressing stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV is essential to effectively 
respond to the HIV epidemic. This strategy prioritizes working with those most vulnerable to 
HIV and its impacts, particularly women, injecting drug users and sex workers. 
</p><p>4. The Government of Austria provided information on its international development 
assistance in support of initiatives on HIV/AIDS. The Austrian Development Cooperation 
regards HIV/AIDS as a cross-cutting theme in its consideration of projects and programmes for 
development cooperation assistance. The majority of the HIV/AIDS-related projects that Austria 
supports are in Africa and Central America, and include multilateral funding through the Joint 
United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) for monitoring national HIV/AIDS 
strategies and commissions, as well as bilateral support that promotes the human rights of 
women and young people, gender equality, and sexual and reproductive rights. 
</p>
<p>5. In its contribution, the Government of Canada underscored its commitment to human 
rights in the fight against HIV and AIDS and recognized the unique impact of HIV on women, 
children and other vulnerable populations. In this regard, Canada has supported a number of 
projects, which aim to provide care for caregivers, provide care and psychosocial support for 
children and their families, provide children with special protection from abuse, exploitation and 
violence, and improve women&#8217;s access to legal, property and inheritance rights and in turn 
reduce their vulnerability to HIV. Significant financial contributions have been made to the 
Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the 3 by 5 Initiative of the World Health 
Organization (WHO) and UNAIDS and the African Health Systems Initiative, as well as 
bilateral funding. This has been complemented by the introduction of a new tax incentive to 
encourage corporate donations of medicines for charitable purposes, as well as the issuance of 
Canada&#8217;s first compulsory license in September 2007 which enabled a Canadian generic drug 
manufacturer to export a generic fixed-dose combination AIDS drug to Rwanda. 
</p>
<p>6. Canada&#8217;s domestic response to HIV includes the Federal Initiative to Address HIV/AIDS 
which focuses on HIV prevention, improved quality of life, reducing the social and economic 
impact of HIV/AIDS and contributing towards the global effort to reduce the spread and mitigate 
the impact of HIV; the Canadian HIV/AIDS Vaccine Initiative - a public-private sector 
partnership for the development of safe, effective, affordable and accessible vaccines; and a 
national stakeholder-led initiative entitled &#8220;Leading together: Canada takes action on HIV/AIDS 
(2005-2010)&#8221; which outlines concrete actions to increase awareness, address social factors 
driving the epidemic, increase prevention, provide leadership in the global response, strengthen 
diagnosis, care, treatment and support, and enhance front-line efforts both in Canada and abroad. 
The Federal Initiative targets interventions to populations most vulnerable to HIV, including gay 
men, aboriginal peoples, prison inmates, people who inject drugs, women, youth at risk, and 
people from countries where HIV is endemic. Canada&#8217;s national response also promotes the 
participation of people living with and affected by HIV in the development of policies and 
programmes within Canada and abroad. The Canadian courts and human rights tribunals have 
also confirmed that HIV and AIDS constitute a disability. 
</p>
<p>7. The contribution of the Government of Cuba highlighted the fact that HIV 
disproportionately affects people living in poverty and that 20 per cent of the world&#8217;s population 
consumes 90 per cent of the resources that are allocated for health. Cuba has a low prevalence of </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>HIV with some 9,304 people currently living with HIV. Access to health care is considered a 
human right, and universal and free access to health-care services is available in Cuba. The 
Government is committed to tackling the social determinants of vulnerability to HIV, 
non-discrimination and equal access to social services in the community. The main pillars of 
the national programme on HIV/AIDS prevention and control are education/prevention, 
diagnosis/research, and epidemiological surveillance and care. The programme guarantees 
universal access to treatment for those who require it, facilitated by the production of generic 
antiretroviral treatments, and in addition targeted interventions have been developed for youth, 
men who have sex with men, women, sex workers, and people living with HIV. Vulnerable 
groups also participate in the planning, monitoring and evaluation of programmes on HIV which 
affect them. 
</p>
<p>8. According to information provided by the Government of Cyprus, people living with HIV 
are entitled by law to free care if they are citizens or belong to special groups such as political 
refugees. This care includes HIV testing and counselling, social support and antiretroviral 
therapy. The current national strategic plan on HIV aims to prevent the sexual transmission of 
HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs); reduce harm-related drug use; prevent prenatal 
transmission; prevent HIV transmission through blood and blood products, tissue and organ 
transplants, and skin piercing procedures; provide health care based on the latest international 
standards in counselling, clinical management and laboratory testing; reduce the personal and 
social impact of HIV; and protect human rights. 
</p>
<p>9. The Government of Finland provided its 2008 progress report on the implementation of the 
Declaration of Commitment prepared for the 2008 High-level Meeting on HIV/AIDS. The report 
highlights that for the first 10-15 years of the epidemic, HIV affected mostly men who have sex 
with men and HIV incidence and prevalence in Finland was among the lowest in western 
European countries. However, the situation changed in 1998, when an outbreak was recorded 
among injecting drug users mainly in the capital area. By 2006-2007, the incidence rate had risen 
and heterosexual sex had become the main mode of transmission. Finnish national policy entitles 
residents to social and health-care services on an equal basis, and HIV testing, counselling, 
treatment and care is provided free of charge. Targeted safer sex programmes and health care 
for sex workers have been developed. Since 2004, primary and secondary education from the age 
of 11 has included education on sexual and reproductive health. The Act on the Status and Rights 
of Patients (1992/785) applies to AIDS patients and guarantees the right to receive information, 
care and treatment, as well as the right to make informed decisions about treatment. HIV is 
covered under the Communicable Diseases Act (1986/583) and is classified as a notifiable 
communicable disease, but does not permit testing or treatment without consent. 
</p>
<p>10. The Government of Greece indicated that in 2007, national action plans on sexual and 
reproductive health and HIV/AIDS and STIs were developed. The action plan on HIV/AIDS and 
STIs includes: prevention measures with a special focus on women which includes promotion of 
the female condom, awareness raising, addressing violence against women and sexual abuse; 
prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT); HIV prevention for young people aged 
15-25 years by incorporating sex education in school curricula, organizing mass media 
awareness-raising campaigns and by monitoring behavioural change; and addressing stigma and 
discrimination of people living with HIV through measures including the planned enactment of a 
specific law on HIV. </p>

 <p>  
</p>
<p>11. Information provided by the Government of Guatemala indicated that the HIV epidemic is 
concentrated in defined subpopulations. The national strategy that has been developed is 
intended to prevent the spread of HIV in the general population and focuses on prevention in the 
most affected provinces. In addition, a general law was passed in 2000 on HIV prevention and to 
protect the human rights of people living with HIV. Among other issues, this law makes HIV 
education, epidemiological surveillance and promotion of the human rights of people living with 
HIV a requirement, and mandates the creation of a national commission to coordinate the 
implementation of national policies in the fight against HIV. The main pillars of the National 
AIDS Strategic Plan (2006-2010) are prevention, access to treatment and behavioural change to 
reduce risk and vulnerability to HIV. The Plan also focuses on at-risk groups such as sex workers 
and men who have sex with men. 
</p>
<p>12. The National HIV/AIDS and STI Strategic Plan (2007-2012) guides the national response 
to HIV in Jamaica. Information submitted by the Government of Jamaica indicates that 
addressing human rights issues and the involvement of vulnerable groups is a key policy focus of 
the Strategic Plan. The prevention component focuses on ensuring the expansion of coverage and 
empowerment of sexually active individuals including the most-at-risk groups (i.e. men who 
have sex with men, sex workers, persons in detention and adolescents). The treatment and care 
component seeks to increase access to antiretroviral therapy, improve quality care and strengthen 
the health sector. The component on an enabling environment and human rights includes the 
amendment of existing legislation (such as the Public Health Act), repealing outdated legislation 
(such as the Venereal Diseases Act, the Quarantine Act, and the Leprosy Act) and the 
development of new laws to support the national response. Community advocacy and 
participation of people living with HIV were also highlighted as key features of the national 
response. To date, some achievements in the human rights arena include the implementation of 
an HIV/AIDS workplace policy by government ministries and other organizational entities, 
revision of the health and family life curriculum and policy to deal more effectively with 
sexuality and HIV/STI prevention, and the proposed establishment of a national HIV-related 
discrimination reporting and redress system. 
</p>
<p>13. The Government of Japan provided information on its efforts to promote the elimination of 
stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV and to raise awareness of HIV. A 
number of educational programmes for the prevention of HIV have been developed, including 
the prevention of infectious diseases in the school curriculum and conducting research for the 
development of instruction manuals on sex education in schools. Japan has also provided 
funding to support a number of projects focusing on prevention, protection, care and 
capacity-building of women and girls affected by HIV and AIDS. 
</p>
<p>14. The contribution from the Government of the Maldives highlighted the fact that their 
national AIDS programme includes youth-friendly, gender-sensitive awareness-raising initiatives 
including priority attention to providing age-appropriate sex education; addresses protection 
from violence, stigma and discrimination in the context of HIV; promotes and protects 
reproductive rights; and focuses on HIV prevention, information, voluntary counselling, and 
testing and quality treatment especially for women and girls. In addition, a new labour law was 
enacted which addresses workplace policies and practices with a view to ensuring human rights 
protection of employees in the context of HIV. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>15. The HIV and AIDS Act 2006 in Mauritius prohibits discrimination against people living 
with HIV and promotes the implementation of needle exchange programmes. Likewise, the 
Ministry of Labour has adopted a workplace policy to promote awareness, support and 
non-discrimination with regard to HIV. A national sexual and reproductive health policy has also 
been adopted which emphasizes the importance of human rights, gender equality and equity in 
providing and delivering health care. According to information provided by the Government of 
Mauritius, the Immigration Act, the Civil Status Act and the HIV and AIDS Act were all 
amended in 2008 and now require an HIV-positive non-citizen to disclose his/her status in order 
to marry a citizen, and work permits are not issued for HIV-positive migrant workers. 
</p>
<p>16. The National Multisectoral HIV and AIDS Strategic Framework 2000-2011 of Mauritius 
aims to reduce the transmission of HIV among vulnerable groups (injecting drug users, prisoners 
and sex workers) by developing, funding and strengthening national mechanisms to fight stigma 
and discrimination, ensuring full access to HIV prevention, information, voluntary counselling 
and testing, education and care, and treatment. The PMTCT programme routinely offers HIV 
testing and counselling and post-exposure prophylaxis is made available in the case of accidental 
injuries and to victims of rape. AIDS orphans are also entitled to social aid. 
</p><p>17. The contribution from the Government of Mexico drew attention to the fact that access to 
HIV treatment, prevention and care have been identified as priorities by the Secretary of Health, 
and that the national response to HIV has been framed in the context of respect for human rights 
and gender mainstreaming. The current national programme on HIV for the period 2007-2012 
focuses on clinical HIV prevention with targeted interventions for key populations such as 
pregnant women, strengthening coordination, capacity-building and increasing resources 
allocated for prenatal care to prevent mother-to-child transmission. Funding has also been 
provided to civil society to support HIV prevention, education, counselling, behaviour change 
and information campaigns for key vulnerable populations. Information was also provided on the 
Ministerial Declaration that was adopted in August 2008 at the conclusion of the first Meeting of 
Ministers of Education and Health to Prevent HIV in Latin America and the Caribbean. In the 
Declaration, Ministers made a commitment to promoting concrete actions for HIV prevention 
among young people by implementing sex education and sexual health promotion programmes. 
</p>
<p>18. According to information provided by the Government of Oman, a number of measures to 
control and raise awareness of the risks and effects of sexually transmitted diseases, in particular 
HIV and AIDS, have been adopted. The national strategy to control AIDS and sexually 
transmitted diseases was launched in December 2007 and aims to improve the health and the 
psychological and social situation of people living with HIV, through the services of health 
counsellors, although these activities do not specifically target women and girls. Additional 
information was provided on the equal participation of women and men in public life in Oman. 
</p>
<p>19. The priorities of the Government of Poland with respect to HIV and AIDS include 
improving HIV prevention, HIV information and education, protecting human rights and 
empowerment of women, and improving care and support of people living with HIV. A new 
national programme on AIDS control and HIV prevention has been developed covering the 
period 2007-2011. To date, mortality due to AIDS has declined in Poland due to greater 
availability of treatment (including PMTCT) which is offered free of charge and the quality of 
life of people living with HIV has improved. Young people, pregnant women, children, men who </p>

 <p>  
</p>
<p>have sex with men, people who use drugs, sex workers and prisoners were indentified as 
vulnerable populations for which targeted interventions have been developed. Refugees can also 
receive antiretroviral therapy if they have acquired refugee status. Asylum-seekers can only 
receive such therapy if they have insurance coverage, they are under the age of 18 or if they are 
pregnant. 
</p>
<p>20. In its report, the Government of Serbia provided information on a number of existing laws 
which concern people living with HIV. A law on infectious diseases requires people with 
infectious diseases to follow medical orders such as obligatory use of condoms and safe sex to 
prevent HIV transmission. The health-care law requires people to provide complete information 
on their health condition to competent health professionals and to follow prescribed therapy - 
written consent is required if a patient wants to stop treatment. This law also permits persons 
bound by professional secrecy (e.g. doctors) to disclose private information to competent 
authorities in order to protect the public, and health professionals may disclose information on 
the HIV-positive status of individuals to adult family members without the consent of the patient, 
to avoid a health risk to a family member. The 2005 Criminal Code criminalizes the transmission 
of HIV - this includes negligent transmission and exposure to HIV, regardless of whether the 
virus has actually been transmitted. To date, only one case for such a criminal offence has been 
brought to the courts and is still pending; it remains to be seen how the courts will interpret and 
implement this provision. 
</p>
<p>21. In Serbia, employers are not allowed to undertake pre-employment HIV testing, but 
employees have a duty to inform their employers of their HIV status. The non-disclosure of 
HIV-positive status may be a legitimate ground for requesting a divorce. People living with 
AIDS or HIV-positive people who develop opportunistic infections are entitled to disability 
benefits and they may also benefit from social welfare. 
</p>
<p>22. The Government of Singapore provided information on its national AIDS programme 
which focuses on prevention and education, detection of HIV-infected cases and managing HIV 
prevention. Significant funding has been allocated for HIV education for the general public, in 
the workplace and in schools, as well as for campaigns for at-risk groups such as sex workers 
and their clients and men who have sex with men. Together with the Singapore National 
Employers Federation, the Government has developed an HIV workplace policy. HIV is a 
legally notifiable disease in Singapore but the confidentiality of people living with HIV is 
protected by law. 
</p>
<p>23. Information provided by the Government of Switzerland highlighted the fact that the 
national programme of HIV and AIDS is based on human rights standards as provided for in the 
Constitution, the European Convention on Human Rights and other applicable international 
human rights conventions. Heterosexual sex is the main mode of HIV transmission in 
Switzerland and in the last few years the number of HIV-positive women has increased. HIV 
interventions are gender-specific and targeted programmes have been developed to reach 
vulnerable groups such as female migrants and sex workers. A recent study undertaken by the 
Swiss AIDS Transmission Survey indicates that 61 per cent of all new infections in women 
take place in stable relationships. Sex education is available for children in school, where 
gender-specific HIV-prevention messages are promoted. Efforts to combat HIV are based on 
partnerships with civil society and the national programme on HIV has identified the following </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>priority groups for HIV-prevention initiatives: homosexuals and other men who have 
unprotected sex with other men, migrants and their partners from high prevalence countries, 
injecting drug users, sex workers, clients of sex workers and tourists who frequently visit 
countries where HIV is endemic and do not use protection. The Penal Code in Switzerland, 
which criminalizes the transmission of HIV even in situations where HIV is not actually 
transmitted, is currently under review and is expected to be amended. To address all forms of 
discrimination, <i>Aide Suisse contre le Sida</i> prepares a biannual report which summarizes incidents 
of discrimination in the context of HIV and develops recommendations for future action. In the 
area of development cooperation and humanitarian assistance, Switzerland has supported 
programmes that promote access to HIV education and information, support and care, voluntary 
counselling and testing, and sexual and reproductive health. Special consideration is given to the 
gender dimension of HIV/AIDS and the role that men and boys play in achieving equality 
between men and women. 
</p>
<p>24. The Government of Thailand indicated that a number of national laws have been amended 
in recent years to promote equal partnership between men and women within the household, to 
prevent sexual violence against women and to improve access to quality health-care services, 
including HIV treatment and prevention. For example, the amendment of the Criminal Code 
Act (2007) broadens the definition of rape to include rape by all sexes, all types of sexual 
penetration, recognizes marital rape and imposes criminal penalties for rape offenders and sexual 
abuse. The National Act (2007) recognizes that women&#8217;s sexual and reproductive health must 
receive special attention and protection. In addition, Thailand is in the process of drafting an 
equal opportunity and gender equality act to promote women&#8217;s rights and eliminate gender 
inequality, as well as a reproductive health act to enhance reproductive health services. 
</p>
<p>25. Thailand&#8217;s National Strategic Plan on HIV Prevention and Alleviation (2007-2011) has 
mainstreamed gender and has focused on enhancing the ability and changing behaviour patterns 
to enable individuals and their families to protect themselves from and prevent the transmission 
of HIV; and securing an enabling environment for families, communities and other individuals to 
protect themselves from infection, stigma, discrimination and to fully participate in all aspects of 
AIDS prevention. Strategic PMTCT interventions resulted in a decline in the rate of HIV 
infection in pregnant women from 2.29 per cent in 1995 to 0.76 per cent in 2007. In addition, a 
programme to promote 100 per cent condom use in commercial sex by empowering sex workers 
to encourage clients to use condoms reportedly prevented an estimated 5.3 million infections 
among men and 2 million infections among women between 1990 and 2007. 
</p>
<p>26. Information provided by the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela pointed 
out that the human rights of people living with HIV are protected by the Constitution. Free 
treatment for HIV is available and by the end of 2008, 25,627 people had received treatment. A 
framework and guidelines for the management of antiretroviral treatment have been developed 
which should enhance the ability of health-care workers to respond to the epidemic. A manual on 
adherence to HIV treatment has also been developed and significant funding has been allocated 
to support HIV-prevention initiatives. In November 2008, a seminar on the prevention of HIV 
was organized with a view to developing guidelines on an HIV-prevention strategy for 2009. </p>

 <p>  
</p>
<p><b>II. CONTRIBUTIONS FROM UNITED NATIONS BODIES,  
PROGRAMMES AND SPECIALIZED AGENCIES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS 
</b></p>
<p>27. The secretariat of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) indicated 
that according to national surveys conducted in 2007, 40 per cent of young males (aged 15-24) 
and 36 per cent of young females had accurate knowledge regarding HIV - still well below the 
95 per cent goal for young people&#8217;s knowledge of HIV unanimously endorsed by Member States 
in the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS. More than 80 per cent of countries, including 
85 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa, report having policies in place to ensure the equal access of 
women to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support. However, the extent to which those 
policies are effectively implemented is not known. Although most countries report having 
strategic frameworks that address the burden of the epidemic on women, only 53 per cent report 
budgeted support for programmes focused on the needs and rights of women in the context of 
HIV. 
</p>
<p>28. UNAIDS also highlighted the fact that the number of countries with laws that protect 
people living with HIV from discrimination has increased since 2003, but one third of countries 
still lack such laws. The degree to which such anti-discrimination laws are enforced is unclear, 
and in some countries such favourable legal frameworks are undermined by the increasing trend 
towards criminalization of HIV transmission. While 74 per cent of countries have policies in 
place to ensure equal access to HIV-related services for vulnerable groups, 57 per cent of these 
have laws or policies that impede access to HIV services for these groups. Even in countries with 
low levels of HIV infection, key populations at risk of HIV infection - including sex workers, 
people who use drugs and men who have sex with men - are experiencing an exceptionally 
heavy burden of the disease, including substantial numbers of new HIV infections. Scaling up 
focused HIV-prevention strategies for such populations represents an urgent human rights and 
public health imperative and requires political leadership. Stigma and discrimination continue to 
be formidable barriers to achieving universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and 
support, and more work needs to happen to address them in practical, programmatic ways. In this 
regard, the UNAIDS secretariat has published a resource guide entitled &#8220;Reducing HIV Stigma 
and Discrimination: a critical part of national AIDS programmes&#8221;, which outlines strategies and 
programmes for overcoming stigma and discrimination. The UNAIDS secretariat and the 
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) have also produced a handbook for 
parliamentarians that highlights how they can help and have helped defend the human rights of 
people living with HIV and other vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>29. In response to concerns about an apparent trend towards criminalization of HIV 
transmission and other punitive responses to the epidemic, the UNAIDS secretariat co-hosted 
with UNDP in November 2007 an &#8220;International Consultation on the Criminalization of HIV 
Transmission&#8221;.<b>5</b> Meeting participants reaffirmed the ongoing relevance and necessity of applying

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the updated 2006 International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights, particularly 
guideline 4, and as follow-up, the UNAIDS secretariat and UNDP published a policy brief on the 
criminalization of HIV transmission, urging Governments to limit criminalization to cases of 
intentional transmission, i.e. where a person knows his or her HIV-positive status, acts with the 
intention to transmit HIV, and does in fact transmit it.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>30. In January 2008, UNAIDS also created the International Task Team on HIV-related travel 
restrictions which operated as an advisory/technical group, with broad representation. Its purpose 
was to draw attention to such restrictions on national, regional and international agendas, calling 
for and supporting efforts toward their elimination. The report of the findings and 
recommendations of the Task Team was presented to the Board of the Global Fund to Fights 
AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria in November 2008,<b>7</b> and the UNAIDS Programme 
Coordinating Board in December 2008.<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  International Labour Organization 
</b></p>
<p>31. The work of the International Labour Organization (ILO) in the context of HIV focuses on 
rights linked to the workplace and to employment. ILO promotes and protects rights through the 
10 key principles of the ILO code of practice on HIV/AIDS and the world of work, which 
provides a framework for standard-setting, advisory and technical cooperation activities with 
Governments, employers and workers in member States. The experience of the ILO in the 
seven years since the code of practice was approved is that measures taken at the workplace 
usually respect the code, but some of its principles are at times omitted from policies. A major 
issue has been HIV testing and confidentiality. In the interest of strengthening the workplace 
response to HIV/AIDS, the ILO Governing Body took a decision to work towards the adoption 
of a new international labour standard on HIV/AIDS which will be considered in 2009 and 2010 
at the International Labour Conference. A study undertaken by the ILO in 2007 on law and 
practice relating to HIV/AIDS and the world of work, found that out of the 181 member States of 
the ILO, 169 had taken action to respond to HIV/AIDS by adopting a general national 
policy/strategy.

<p><b>C.  Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) 
continues to address HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, care and support as a human rights 
concern. In collaboration with other United Nations agencies and programmes, OHCHR uses the 
updated 2006 International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights both as an advocacy 
tool and to provide guidance at country level on implementing a rights-based response to the 
epidemic. HIV-related issues are also mainstreamed in the work of the treaty monitoring bodies, 
the special procedures and the universal periodic review process, where emphasis has been 
placed on the human rights protection of people living with HIV, especially vulnerable 
populations. A number of joint activities have been undertaken together with UNAIDS, 
including the publication of a handbook on HIV and human rights for national human rights 
institutions which aims to provide guidance to these institutions on integrating HIV-related 
human rights issues into their work. Together with other United Nations partners, OHCHR has 
also been engaged in providing technical assistance and promoting the integration of human 
rights norms and standards into legislation on HIV. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
</b></p>
<p>33. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has 
assumed a lead role in the area of HIV prevention for young people in educational institutions. 
UNESCO has adopted a four-pronged approach to supporting an enabling environment for 
women, children and other vulnerable populations which includes the right of all children to 
access education with particular attention to young girls, orphans and other children affected by 
HIV and AIDS; the right of teachers living with HIV to receive appropriate support and to keep 
working; the right to confidentiality, non-stigmatizing curricula, and support services in the 
education sector; and the right of young people to learn about HIV and AIDS and how they can 
protect themselves. 
</p>
<p>34. The fact that 40 per cent of all new infections in 2007 were amongst young people 
aged 15-24 and that only 50 per cent of young people have been educated about HIV prevention, 
is of particular concern to UNESCO. In many curricula on HIV and AIDS, reference to sex 
education is avoided or greater emphasis is placed on the negative consequences of sex, even 
though 75 per cent of all HIV infections occur through sexual transmission. UNESCO 
therefore initiated a programme on sex, relationships and HIV/STI education in 2008, which will 
result in the formulation of guidelines in this area. UNESCO was also instrumental in the 
elaboration of a ministerial declaration adopted in 2008 by Ministers of Education and Health 
from Latin America and the Caribbean on comprehensive sex education as part of the school 
curriculum in these regions. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs 
</b></p>
<p>35. The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs has stated that the 
Economic and Social Council has adopted two resolutions which deal with the HIV-related 
human rights of vulnerable populations. One resolution requires Governments to strengthen </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>legal, policy, administrative and other measures to reduce the vulnerability of youth to HIV.<b>9</b> 
The other resolution urges Governments, donors and UNAIDS to expand efforts to address 
inequality and inequity between men and women, gender-based violence, stigma, discrimination, 
deficiencies in sexual and reproductive health and the lack of respect for human rights as major 
factors that heighten vulnerability to HIV.<b>10</b> In addition, the priority theme of the Commission on 
the Status of Women in 2009 will be &#8220;the equal sharing of responsibilities between women and 
men, including caregiving in the context of HIV/AIDS&#8221; and the 2009 high-level segment of 
ECOSOC will also address the issue of &#8220;implementing the internationally agreed goals and 
commitment in regard to global public health&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  United Nations Department of Public Information 
</b></p>
<p>36. Through its network of 63 information centres, the United Nations Department of Public 
Information (DPI) has engaged various groups advocating the protection of the human rights of 
women, children and vulnerable groups who are either HIV-positive or orphans as a result of 
AIDS. United Nations Information Centres (UNICs) in Accra, Brussels, Bujumbura, Dakar, 
Moscow, and Nairobi have led or participated in seminars, workshops and panel discussions that 
sought to address gender equality and the empowerment of women and youth. Other UNICs 
have raised awareness on topical issues such as PMTCT, gender-based violence and HIV/AIDS, 
and HIV-related human rights concerns of young people. 
</p>
<p><b>G.  United Nations Development Fund for Women 
</b></p>
<p>37. The United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) integrates gender equality 
and women&#8217;s rights perspectives into its work on HIV. This has involved the development of 
strategies that make clear the links between HIV and violence against women, feminized poverty 
and women&#8217;s limited voice in decision-making. The United Nations Trust Fund in Support of 
Actions to Eliminate Violence against Women, managed by UNIFEM, is funding a first-ever 
global learning initiative on how to address the linkages between violence against women and 
HIV/AIDS. In addition, a number of guidance documents and capacity-building tools have been 
developed aimed at protecting the rights of women in the context of HIV which include guidance 
on applying the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women 
in designing responses to HIV and a course for practitioners on integrating HIV and violence 
against women in programming and policies. 
</p>
<p><b>H.  Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
</b></p>
<p>38. In its contribution, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) referred to a guidance tool they developed in 2006 to ensure the protection of 
refugees, internally displaced persons and other persons of concern in relation to HIV, which 
covers discrimination; access to HIV and AIDS health care; access to asylum procedures; 
protection from arbitrary detention and unlawful restrictions on freedom of movement; respect

<p>for confidentiality and privacy; provision of HIV voluntary counselling and testing; freedom 
from mandatory HIV testing; access to durable solutions; HIV-protection-related needs of 
women and children; and access to HIV information and education. UNHCR has been working 
with resettlement countries to ensure that people living with HIV have access to resettlement 
procedures and are not denied access based on their HIV status. Currently, a number of countries 
require an HIV test before resettlement and issues regarding informed consent, confidentiality, 
disclosure of HIV status and pre- and post test counselling are of concern. In 2007, UNHCR 
produced an antiretroviral medication policy for refugees, which outlines human rights 
considerations to ensure equal access to treatment for populations of concern to UNHCR. The 
Executive Committee also adopted resolution 107 on children at risk and recommended that all 
efforts are made to ensure access to child-friendly health services and to HIV prevention, 
treatment, care and support including PMTCT and age-sensitive reproductive health and HIV 
information and education for adolescents. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues 
</b></p>
<p>39. The United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues has, throughout its sessions, 
paid attention to HIV and its impact on indigenous peoples throughout the world. It has 
recommended on several occasions that data disaggregation and culturally appropriate 
HIV/AIDS programmes should be implemented or improved, and has urged Governments, the 
United Nations system and intergovernmental organizations to ensure the full and effective 
participation, and free, prior and informed consent, of indigenous peoples in all programmes 
related to HIV prevention and treatment of indigenous communities.<b>11</b> 
</p>
<p><b>III. CONTRIBUTIONS FROM NON-GOVERNMENTAL  
ORGANIZATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>40. Human Rights Watch provided information based on research conducted in Canada, India, 
Kenya, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, the United States of America, Zambia and Zimbabwe 
concerning human rights violations that are fuelling the HIV epidemic and presented key 
recommendations for addressing them. First, the report stressed that the expansion of HIV testing 
and counselling should be accompanied by safeguards against the risk of human rights violations 
which can arise from involuntary testing, breaches of confidentiality, and failure to provide 
linkages to other health services. Second, the report highlighted the fact that gender-based 
inequality puts women at risk of HIV, impedes women&#8217;s ability to access HIV information and 
testing, and is also a barrier to starting or continuing lifesaving antiretroviral therapy. A number 
of countries have failed to recognize and adequately address the ways in which such abuses 
hinder women&#8217;s HIV treatment. Third, a significant number of children do not have the access to 
HIV treatment that they need and are less likely than adults to receive antiretroviral therapy. 
Additional assistance, including paediatric counselling, additional resources for sufficient 
nutrition and transportation for caregivers is needed to reach children. Fourth, harm reduction 
services remain out of reach for the vast majority of drug users worldwide even though outside 
of sub-Saharan Africa, nearly one third of all new HIV infections can be traced to the sharing of 
contaminated syringes by people who inject drugs. Policing practices, including the fact that 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>11
</b>  See, for example, E/2006/43 and E/2003/43. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>many public hospitals and drug treatment centres collect and share information about an 
individual&#8217;s drug use with law enforcement, compound the inaccessibility of treatment. Research 
from Human Rights Watch indicates that many drug users who have been subjected to drug 
detoxification and re-education have been denied HIV services altogether or provided such 
services in a manner that violates their fundamental right to health and to life. 
</p>
<p>41. Fifth, according to the submission of Human Rights Watch, incarceration is a critical risk 
factor for HIV. In many countries, HIV prevalence in prison populations has been reported to be 
several times the prevalence in the population at large. At the same time, there is also an 
increased risk of exposure to other infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. Yet, prisoners and 
other persons in detention have little or no access to HIV prevention, care, and treatment services 
even when these are available in the general community. Sixth, despite the long-standing 
recognition of heightened HIV risk faced by migrants and mobile populations, the international 
community has largely ignored this call for action and has failed to establish policies or 
mechanisms to provide health-care services to these populations. Seventh, more than 
85 countries still uphold anti-sodomy laws that criminalize consensual homosexual contact 
between men and often between women, impeding access to HIV/AIDS services by placing 
people at risk of legal penalties. Finally, the fact that many countries do not recognize palliative 
care and pain treatment as priorities in health care was raised as a concern, as well as the fact that 
narcotic drug control regulations or enforcement practices in many countries impose unnecessary 
restrictions that limit access to morphine and other opioid pain relievers. 
</p>
<p>42. In a submission by the International Association for the Study of Pain, the interface 
between human rights and medical care, specifically in the context of pain management and 
palliative care for patients with HIV, was reflected. They drew attention to the fact that 
according to WHO, every year an estimated 1.4 million patients with end-stage HIV suffer 
moderate to severe pain, but do not receive appropriate treatment and that most countries do not 
have palliative care policies. This Association made the argument that palliative care and pain 
management constitute important components of the right to health for persons living with HIV 
and called for ensuring the provision of basic medication for symptom control and terminal care, 
including analgesics; adopting and implementing national pain and palliative care policies; and 
ensuring the education of health professionals in the care of patients with HIV and AIDS which 
includes pain management and palliative care. 
</p>
<p>43. A number of proposals for further action were made and directed to Governments by the 
International Council of AIDS Service Organizations (ICASO). They include the need to: 
(a) fully implement the Declaration of Commitment and the Political Declaration, including 
reaching universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support by 2010, as adopted by 
the General Assembly; (b) ensure legal protection against discrimination and violence against 
women and girls, and decriminalizing sex work, men who have sex with men, transgender 
people and people who use drugs; (c) repeal existing legislation and halt any efforts to pass 
legislation criminalizing HIV transmission and exposure; (d) abolish laws that discriminate 
against women and girls, or laws that contribute to human rights violations against women and 
girls; (e) involve key populations such as people living with HIV, sex workers, people who use 
drugs, men who have sex with men and transgender people in policy and programme design and 
implementation; and (f) develop mechanisms for the redress of human rights violations. ICASO </p>

 <p>  
</p>
<p>also called for greater attention to be paid by the Human Rights Council and the special 
procedures to the situation of coerced and forced sterilization of HIV-positive women, the 
impact of criminalization of HIV transmission, exposure of marginalized groups and the risk of 
selective prosecution. 
</p>
<p>44. The International Community of Women Living with HIV/AIDS (ICW) raised concerns 
related to forced and coerced sterilization of HIV-positive women without consent and the fact 
that sterilization is often a prerequisite for women to access other services, including prenatal 
care. The growing trend to criminalize the transmission of HIV was also highlighted, drawing 
attention to the adverse effect that such laws may have on women as they are more likely to be 
tested for HIV through routine testing for antenatal care or as part of gynaecological procedures 
and the fact that criminalization incorrectly places the blame for HIV on people living with HIV, 
impedes the desire to get tested, and increases stigma and discrimination against people living 
with HIV. Provisions on the criminalization of HIV transmission are often overly broad and 
could therefore potentially include criminal penalties for mother-to-child transmission, or the 
selective prosecution of women who are sex workers and injecting drug users. 
</p><p>45. ICW also highlighted the fact that HIV-positive women are often denied reproductive 
rights, including the freedom to decide whether to bear children, the number of children and the 
spacing of children. They are also provided with insufficient information about reducing 
mother-to-child transmission and often lack access to treatment. In light of the above, a number 
of proposals were made with regard to the human rights of HIV-positive women as follows: 
decrease stigma and discrimination against HIV-positive women at health-care facilities; involve 
HIV-positive women in all planning, programming and decision-making initiatives that impact 
their lives; create accessible, available, high-quality and acceptable services for HIV-positive 
women; examine the situation of forced sterilization of HIV-positive women; end the 
criminalization of HIV transmission; develop legal protection for people living with HIV 
including protection from discrimination; develop mechanisms for redress when the human 
rights of HIV-positive people are violated; abolish laws that discriminate against women and 
girls; and abolish laws that criminalize behaviours which further stigmatize and marginalize 
groups of women, including laws which criminalize drug use and sexual orientation. 
</p>
<p>46. The International Harm Reduction Association (IHRA) indicated that although an 
estimated 15.9 million people inject drugs in 158 countries and territories, the global state of 
harm reduction is poor, especially in countries where such services are needed most. Detailed 
information was provided on human rights abuses against people who use drugs, and which 
impede HIV prevention, treatment and care efforts, which include denial of harm reduction 
services, discrimination in accessing antiretroviral therapy, abusive law enforcement practices, 
disproportionate criminal penalties, and coercive and abusive drug dependence treatment. The 
submission also drew attention to the fact that drug control entities rarely discuss human rights 
and the human rights bodies and mechanisms, in turn, rarely focus on drug policy. IHRA was 
concerned that this has resulted in an international system and policy environment where 
significant human rights violations, many impeding HIV-prevention efforts, fall between these 
two separate regimes, unaddressed and largely ignored. A number of recommendations were, 
therefore, made to the human rights entities within the United Nations system to address these 
systemic gaps. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>47. The Open Society Institute (OSI) highlighted the intersection between HIV/AIDS and 
violations of the right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment. Based on documented cases of violations, OSI provided information on abuses 
which include physical and psychological abuses against sex workers, including rape by police 
and prison officials, demands for sex as payment for medical treatment, and medico-militia raids 
where doctors and the police forcibly test sex workers for sexually transmitted infections; 
flogging, chaining, caging, unmedicated opiate withdrawal, verbal and sexual abuse against drug 
users; confinement of people living with HIV in prisons, pretrial detention facilities, and 
compulsory drug treatment centres without access to antiretroviral treatment, opiate substitution 
therapy, condoms and sterile injection equipment, tuberculosis control and treatment, and 
treatment for hepatitis C; involuntary and prolonged detention of patients with drug-resistant 
tuberculosis in conditions that lack proper infection control measures; denial of pain medication 
to people living with HIV; abuse of HIV-positive women in health settings including coerced 
abortion and coerced sterilization; and the intentional use of painful withdrawal from opiates to 
coerce confessions from drug users. OSI recommended that special attention be given to the role 
of torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment in future reports to the 
Human Rights Council and that the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment consider the linkage between his mandate and HIV in his 
future reports. 
</p>
<p>48. The Quaker United Nations Office (QUNO) provided information on HIV/AIDS and 
women and girls in prison and drew attention to the fact that in many countries female prisoners 
are infected with sexually transmitted diseases including HIV. Women and girls are also at risk 
of contracting HIV whilst in prison due to their vulnerability to sexual violence. Research 
undertaken in Australia indicated that 89 per cent of female prisoners had been sexually abused 
at some point in their lives and 70-80 per cent of females in prison were survivors of incest. 
Research in women&#8217;s prisons in Brazil found that HIV affects a higher percentage of 
incarcerated women than men. QUNO recommended that the same HIV-related services should 
be available to women and girls inside and outside prison with guaranteed protection from 
involuntary testing and the conditions secured for confidential, free and informed consent. 
</p>
<p>49. Oxfam called for better monitoring of confidentiality and a code of ethics on HIV which 
includes guidance on disclosure of HIV status and better clarity on the opt in and opt out policies 
around HIV testing, as well as a better understanding of the human rights implications of such 
policies. The need to protect people living with HIV from criminalization and to ensure that 
persons vulnerable to HIV and who may be involved in illegal activities (e.g. sex workers and 
injecting drug users) have access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support was also 
emphasized. 
</p>
<p><b>IV. CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>50. <b>The contributions received for the preparation of this report confirm the central role 
of human rights in the response to HIV and point to a number of challenges that the 
international community faces in addressing the human rights aspects of the epidemic. 
</b></p>
<p>51. <b>In his report on the implementation of the Declaration of Commitment and the 
Political Declaration, the Secretary-General noted that substantial barriers remain that 
reduce access to HIV-prevention services and that 63 per cent of countries report having </b></p>

 <p>  
</p>
<p><b>policies that interfere with the access of vulnerable populations to HIV-related services.12 
The information received for the preparation of this report highlights the fact that those 
vulnerable to HIV infection or to human rights violations related to the disease include 
children and youth, indigenous populations, injecting drug users, men who have sex with 
men, migrants and other mobile populations, prisoners and persons in detention, sex 
workers, and women. Some of the areas that were highlighted and require further 
attention in order to understand their impact on the enjoyment of human rights include 
existing policies on HIV testing, disclosure, education and information, access to treatment 
and care (especially paediatric treatment, prevention of mother-to-child transmission, 
post-exposure prophylaxis and palliative care), sexual and reproductive health, and the 
criminalization of HIV transmission. 
</b></p>
<p>52. <b>Legal protection from stigma, discrimination and other human rights violations of 
people living with HIV was a prominent feature of the information received for this report, 
as many countries move towards reform or enactment of laws related to HIV. The 
contributions received also highlight a common message, that whilst laws that protect 
people living with HIV from stigma, discrimination and which prevent the spread of HIV 
are essential to mitigating the adverse effects of HIV, such laws must be evidence-informed, 
non-discriminatory and should not result in unintended negative consequences in order to 
be effective. 
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>Finally, contributions reaffirmed the fact that the realization of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms is essential to meet the goal of universal access to HIV prevention, 
treatment, care and support by 2010 and to reduce vulnerability to HIV.
