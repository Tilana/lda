<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present annual report of the Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of 
peaceful assembly and of association is submitted to the Human Rights Council pursuant to 
Council resolutions 15/21 and 24/5. It covers the activities the mandate holder carried out 
between 1 March 2013 and 28 February 2014 and addresses legislation and practices that 
discriminate against certain groups and deprive them of their rights to freely associate and 
peacefully assemble. Recommendations to various stakeholders are made, with a view to 
better promoting and protecting the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
association.  
</p>
<p>2. To prepare the present report, the Special Rapporteur convened a one-day expert 
meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, on 9 December 2013. Moreover, he benefited from 
consultations held in Asia (Singapore) and Latin America (El Salvador) on the topic and 
from submissions by various individuals and groups. In accordance with Human Rights 
Council resolution 15/21, he also took into account relevant elements of work available 
within the Council.1 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Communications 
</b></p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur sent a total of 207 communications between 1 March 2013 
and 28 February 2014. His observations on communications addressed to States and on the 
replies received between 1 March 2013 and 28 February 2014 are enclosed in an addendum 
to the present report (A/HRC/26/29/Add.1).

</p>
<p><b> III. Threats to the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly  
and of association for groups most at risk 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Definitions 
</b></p>
<p>7. Backlash from the Arab Spring of early 2011 continues to be felt globally, with 
increasingly less space in which civil society actors can promote or defend collectively a 
field of mutual interest. Democracy involves more than just exercising the right to vote. For 
democracy to flourish, people must be guaranteed the whole range of fundamental rights 
and freedoms, including the rights to freedom of expression and of assembly, as a means to 
influence the public policies of the State. In recent years many States have responded to 
people&#8217;s assertions of peaceful dissent by violently clamping down on peaceful protests and 
other forms of assembly, unduly restricting the ability of associations to form and operate, 
and physically assaulting civil society actors.  
</p>
<p>8. While those actions have negatively affected all those who choose to exercise their 
rights to peacefully assemble and freely associate, certain groups are at particular risk of 
having their space all but vanish. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur focuses on </p>


<p>the challenges facing the various groups that are often relegated to the margins of society, 
both in their daily lives and in the exercise of their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly 
and of association. He hopes to cast the spotlight on the ways in which the denial of the 
rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association leads to the marginalization of 
those groups and how marginalization exacerbates their inability to effectively exercise 
their rights. 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur is mindful that the State is not the only perpetrator of 
violations relating to peaceful assembly and association. The actions of non-State actors 
play a significant role in denying groups most at risk the space to exercise their rights, often 
through prevailing patriarchal attitudes, stereotypes, assumptions and social constructions 
that keep those groups at the margins of society. In that respect, the Special Rapporteur also 
recalls that the obligations of States extend beyond respecting and fulfilling rights, to 
protecting rights holders from violations and abuses by others.  
</p>
<p>10. As a starting point, the Special Rapporteur acknowledges that groups most at risk 
share the experience of discrimination, unequal treatment and harassment. He describes 
those groups based on their level of marginalization in the exercise of the rights to freedom 
of peaceful assembly and of association. Some of the groups that are considered in the 
present report to be most at risk are persons with disabilities; youth, including children; 
women; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people; members of 
minority groups; indigenous peoples; internally displaced persons; and non-nationals, 
including refugees, asylum seekers and migrant workers.  
</p>
<p>11. For the purposes of the report, the groups most at risk will also include groups and 
individuals who are targeted not because of their identity, but because they actively lobby 
for the rights of those most at risk of discrimination and retribution. Human rights 
defenders, including journalists, trade unionists and environmental activists, among others, 
face considerable opposition, harassment, stigmatization and even physical attacks from 
State and non-State actors in many countries.  
</p>
<p>12. The term &#8220;marginalized&#8221; is adopted in the present report to describe those groups, 
rather than the term &#8220;vulnerable&#8221;, which the Special Rapporteur considers as depicting 
members of such groups as helpless and passive victims of the conditions in which they 
find themselves. In his view, the conditions and situations that create marginalization are 
maintained by deliberate acts or omissions by both State and non-State actors to the 
continued detriment of such groups. Regardless of the causes, the improvement of the 
circumstances is primarily the responsibility of the State. In other words, marginalization, 
rather than vulnerability, more accurately captures the societal attitudes and assumptions 
that shape the lives of those affected by these conditions.  
</p>
<p>13. These groups should not be viewed as monolithic or discrete. Individuals can 
legitimately claim multiple identities, such as being a woman and a person with disability, a 
member of a minority group and stateless. The combinations are numerous. All these 
individuals can experience marginalization at multiple levels and in different ways within 
those categories. Often the multiple dimensions of marginalization go unrecognized and 
unaddressed. In order to understand the impact of discrimination on marginalized groups, it 
is important to recognize the different life experiences of the groups and individuals within 
the groups. In the present report, as far as possible, the nuances across all of the groups 
most at risk are taken into account. 
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur notes with deep concern the innumerable examples of 
violation and abuse of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association 
affecting groups most at risk. It will not be possible within the scope of this report to 
identify all of them and the ways in which such groups are specifically affected. Instead, the </p>


<p>Special Rapporteur will present patterns of violations and abuses with a view to articulating 
standards that guide practice while providing a few illustrative examples. 
</p>
<p>15. In general, restrictions on and exclusions from the exercise of the rights to freedom 
of peaceful assembly and of association have the consequence of reinforcing 
marginalization. The inverse is also true and more compelling: marginalization often means 
that individuals and groups are unable to effectively exercise their rights to freedom of 
peaceful assembly and of association. That interrelation is evident in the illustrative 
examples discussed in the following sections. The ability to exercise the rights to freedom 
of peaceful assembly and of association constitutes a key component in the empowerment 
of marginalized communities and individuals.  
</p>
<p><b> B. International human rights law 
</b></p>
<p>16. The rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association are guaranteed to 
everyone without distinction. Article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights guarantees to all individuals equal and effective protection against discrimination on 
the grounds identified in article 2. Numerous international and regional human rights 
instruments contain prohibitions of discrimination both generally and in relation to specific 
groups.  
</p>
<p>17. The Human Rights Committee understands &#8220;discrimination&#8221; to imply &#8220;any 
distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference which is based on any ground such as race, 
colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, 
birth or other status, and which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the 
recognition, enjoyment or exercise by all persons, on an equal footing, of all rights and 
freedoms&#8221;.3 The Committee has established that sexual orientation and gender identity also 
constitute prohibited grounds for discrimination under article 2 of the Covenant.4 
Discrimination results from legislation and practices that explicitly exclude or target groups 
or individuals in those groups.  
</p>
<p>18. Various international law instruments point to particular principles and measures 
that States should adopt in order to achieve non-discrimination and equality. For example, 
States should: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensure that in all actions concerning children in all spheres, the best interests of the 
child are a primary consideration;5 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Eliminate gender-based violence, affirm women&#8217;s right to reproductive choice and 
modify social or cultural patterns so as to eliminate the idea of stereotyped roles for 
men and women;6 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Protect people from homophobic and transphobic violence, prevent torture and 
cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment on the grounds of sexual orientation and 
gender identity and also prohibit discrimination on those grounds, repeal laws 
criminalizing homosexuality, safeguard the freedoms of expression, association and 
peaceful assembly for LGBTI people and recognize the rights of LGBTI people to

and prohibit discriminatory legislation, in particular concerning remuneration, 
conditions of work and terms of employment;10 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Contribute to the national, economic and social development processes of internally 
displaced people.11  
</p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur notes that, in general, State obligations to achieve non-
discrimination and equality are immediate and not subject to progressive realization.  
</p><p>20. International human rights instruments that protect the rights of particular groups 
specifically recognize directly or indirectly the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and 
of association for those groups:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Convention on the Rights of the Child requires States parties recognizes the 
rights of the child to freedom of association and to freedom of peaceful assembly 
(art. 15).  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 
requires States to take all appropriate measures to ensure that women are able to 
participate in the political and public life of the country on equal terms with men. 
That includes the right to participate in non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and 
associations concerned with the public and political life of the country (art. 7). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The obligation of States to safeguard the human rights of LGBTI people is well 
established in international human rights law on the basis of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, which, in article 1, unequivocally reads: &#8220;All human 
beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.&#8221; Moreover, it is enshrined in the 
jurisprudence and interpretation of State obligations arising from international 
human rights law by numerous United Nations human rights treaty bodies.12 In its 
resolution 17/19, the Human Rights Council expressed concern at acts of violence 
and discrimination, in all regions of the world, committed against individuals 
because of their sexual orientation and gender identity.

(2003) and No. 13 (2011); and the Committee against Torture, general comment No. 2 (2007).  </p>


<p>&#8226; Article 5 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is of particular 
importance in ensuring that persons with disabilities are treated as equal before and 
under the law. Article 29 explicitly recognizes the rights of persons with disabilities 
to participate in political and public life, including by participating in NGOs 
concerned with public and political life and by forming and joining organizations to 
represent the interests of persons with disabilities at all levels. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Indigenous peoples are entitled, inter alia, to the right to participate fully in the 
political, economic, social and cultural life of the State, and to determine their own 
identity or membership in accordance with their customs and traditions.13 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The right of minority groups to freely associate is implied in the protection of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of their right, in community 
with other members of their group, to enjoy their own culture, practice their religion 
and use their own language (art. 27). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families guarantees the right to join associations 
and take part in the activities of associations, but stops short of protecting the right 
to form associations (art. 26). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Internally displaced persons have the same rights and freedoms under international 
and domestic law as other persons in the country and, in particular, have the right to 
associate freely and participate equally in community affairs.14 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Refugees lawfully staying in a country are entitled, in relation to the right to freedom 
of association, to the most favourable treatment accorded to nationals of a foreign 
country, in the same circumstances.15  
</p>
<p>&#8226; In relation to non-nationals, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination recognizes that States may require non-citizens to have work permits 
in order to be eligible for job offers. However, all individuals are entitled to the 
enjoyment of labour and employment rights, including the freedom of assembly and 
association, once an employment relationship has been initiated until it is 
terminated.16  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs 
of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms explicitly recognizes the rights of human rights defenders to 
peacefully assemble, to form, join and participate in non-governmental 
organizations, associations or groups and to communicate with non-governmental 
and intergovernmental organizations (art. 5). In its resolution 22/6, the Human 
Rights Council recognized the importance of the rights to freedom of peaceful 
assembly and of association for defenders.  
</p>
<p>21. As the Special Rapporteur has pointed out in previous reports, freedom should be 
the rule and restrictions the exception (A/HRC/23/39, para. 18). Any restrictions imposed 
must be strictly motivated by the limited concerns which are prescribed by law and which 
are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, 
public order, the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and

<p>freedoms of others.17 Of utmost importance, as stated by the Human Rights Committee, is 
that where such restrictions are made, States must demonstrate their necessity and only take 
such measures as are proportionate to the pursuance of legitimate aims in order to ensure 
continuous and effective protection of Covenant rights.18  
</p>
<p><b> C. Challenges to the enjoyment of the right to freedom of peaceful 
assembly by groups most at risk 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Legislation governing freedom of peaceful assembly that contains explicitly 
discriminatory provisions 
</b></p>
<p>22. Article 21 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recognizes that 
the right to freedom of peaceful assembly should be enjoyed by everyone, as provided for 
by article 2 of the Covenant and resolutions 15/21, 21/16 and 24/5 of the Human Rights 
Council. Importantly, in its resolution 24/5, the Council reminded States of their obligation 
to respect and fully protect the rights of all individuals to assemble peacefully and associate 
freely, online as well as offline, including in the context of elections, and including persons 
espousing minority or dissenting views or beliefs, human rights defenders, trade unionists 
and others, including migrants, seeking to exercise or to promote those rights. Despite this, 
some Member States have laws that contain explicitly discriminatory provisions prohibiting 
assemblies by certain groups. 
</p>
<p>23. In Malaysia, for example, the Peaceful Assembly Act 2012 prohibits people under 
the age of 21 from organizing a public demonstration. Children under the age of 15 cannot 
even participate. Migrants and non-citizens may also face undue restrictions on their 
assembly rights. The same Act explicitly divests non-citizens of their right to organize or 
participate in a peaceful assembly. Article 33 of the Constitution of Mexico states that 
foreigners &#8220;may not in any way participate in the political affairs of the country&#8221;, a 
provision that can be interpreted as prohibiting the rights of non-citizens to engage in 
peaceful assemblies. Similarly, article 354 of the Constitution of Myanmar extends the right 
of assembly only to citizens.  
</p>
<p>24. In the case of youth, including children, the Special Rapporteur acknowledges that 
there may be safety concerns when young people participate in some public 
demonstrations. However, he believes that laws such as that of Malaysia are not tailored 
narrowly enough to specifically address that concern. Rather, a blanket ban on individuals 
of a certain age eliminates the right to participate in peaceful public assemblies for an entire 
portion of the population, without exception, contrary to article 15 of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child.  
</p>
<p>25. In the case of non-citizens and migrants, the Special Rapporteur notes that 
international law does allow for some citizenship-related limitations on certain political 
rights, such as voting rights and the ability to hold political office. It is however precisely 
for that reason that States should ensure that migrants are not stripped of other fundamental 
rights, particularly assembly rights. An individual&#8217;s lack of citizenship or legal status does 
not mean that she or he should have no voice whatsoever in the political, economic or 
social affairs of her or his country of residence. In a sense, groups that are disenfranchised 
from mainstream political activities, such as voting and holding office, have an even greater 
need for alternative means to participate in the public sphere. Peaceful assemblies are an 
important tool for allowing the voices of otherwise excluded groups to be heard.  
</p>
<p>

<p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>18 
 General comment No. 31 (2004), para. 6. </p>


<p>26. The Special Rapporteur also notes that the failure to provide any outlet for 
politically excluded groups to air their grievances can be counterproductive and carry 
severe consequences. Further, such restrictions can foster or magnify a culture of silence 
among the excluded group, putting them at higher risk of violations and abuses that may go 
unreported, uninvestigated and unpunished.  
</p>
<p>27. In addition, sexual orientation and gender identity are increasingly used as a basis 
for explicit discrimination in the area of assembly rights. In Ukraine, a draft law &#8220;on 
propaganda of homosexuality&#8221;, which prohibits &#8220;propaganda of homosexual relations&#8221; 
aimed at children, was recommended in 2013 for the consideration of the parliament. This 
draft law defines &#8220;propaganda&#8221; as any public action to spread information on same-sex 
relations, including peaceful assemblies and educational courses. In August 2012, a Russian 
court upheld a Moscow city council ban on gay pride parades, prohibiting such assemblies 
for the next 100 years. In early 2014, the President of Nigeria signed the Same Sex 
Marriage (Prohibition) Act, which bans gay marriage and also makes it an offence to 
register, operate, participate in or support gay clubs, societies, organizations, processions or 
meetings, or to make a public display of a same-sex amorous relationship, directly or 
indirectly. An offence is punishable by a prison term of 10 years. The provision effectively 
bans any public or private meeting on the subject of sexual orientation and gender identity. 
In Uganda, the President signed a new anti-homosexuality bill into law in February 2014. 
This law imposes a sentence of life imprisonment for homosexuality and same-sex 
marriage and five to seven years of imprisonment for the &#8220;promotion&#8221; of homosexuality, 
which directly targets and threatens the work of LGBTI organizations and human rights 
defenders. In Kuwait, the new criminal offence of &#8220;imitating the opposite sex&#8221; directly 
targets and criminalizes transgender people and anyone seen as not conforming to gender 
norms. It has resulted in harassment, arbitrary arrest and detention, abuse, torture and 
sexual assault of transgender people. Expressing its concern, the Human Rights Committee 
has recommended that the offence be repealed (CCPR/C/KWT/CO/2, para. 30).  
</p><p>28. Such provisions are in clear violation of international human rights law. In that 
regard, the Human Rights Committee stated that &#8220;the reference to &#8216;sex&#8217; in articles 2, 
paragraph 1, and 26 [of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights] is to be 
taken as including sexual orientation&#8221;.19 Since then, in numerous concluding observations, 
the Committee has urged State parties to guarantee equal rights to all individuals, as 
established in the Covenant, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. General legal provisions on freedom of peaceful assembly that have 
a disproportionately negative impact on certain groups 
</b></p>
<p>29. In some circumstances, general laws governing assemblies may have a 
disproportionate impact on certain groups who exercise or seek to exercise their assembly 
rights. Those restrictions appear to be neutral on their face, but in practice, they may have a 
harsh impact on the assembly rights of certain groups most at risk. They may also be 
drafted to appear neutral, but in practice are applied only against certain groups.  
</p>
<p>30. Some of the most prominent examples include &#8220;public morality&#8221; laws that have been 
used selectively against those promoting LGBTI rights. In June 2013, the President of the 
Russian Federation signed legislation banning &#8220;propaganda of non-traditional sexual 
relations&#8221; among minors. There is no legal definition in the Russian law of what constitutes 
non-traditional sexual relations, but it is widely acknowledged to be code for homosexual 
relations. While legislators have argued that the main purpose of the law is to protect 
children, the Committee on the Rights of the Child expressed concern at the law and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>19  <i>Toonen</i> v. <i>Australia</i>, para. 8.7. </p>


<p>recommended its repeal, as it found that it encouraged the stigmatization and discrimination 
of LGBTI children and the targeting and persecution of the LGBTI community 
(CRC/C/RUS/CO/4-5, para. 25). 
</p><p>31. The Special Rapporteur strongly condemns the recent wave of laws, regulations and 
practices in some parts of the world designed to silence, intimidate and harass those who 
promote the human rights of LGBTI people through public assemblies. The aforementioned 
law in the Russian Federation makes &#8220;propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations&#8221;, 
which includes gay pride events or any assembly supporting LGBTI rights, punishable by 
administrative fines of up to 5,000 roubles for citizens and up to 100,000 roubles for 
foreigners and subjects the latter to deportation. Public assemblies are at the heart of an 
active civil society and a functioning democracy. Tolerance of others, pluralism and 
broadmindedness must be harnessed. As stated previously, it is not necessary to agree with 
what people do, but as long as it is done peacefully, and does not incite violence and hatred, 
it should be allowed.20 
</p>
<p>32. Numerous jurisdictions have in recent years banned peaceful protesters from 
covering their faces during demonstrations, motivated by fears that demonstrators who 
wear masks or hoods could engage in violence and escape punishment due to their 
concealed identities. Besides the fact that violent acts during peaceful demonstrations are 
already illegal under the laws of virtually every jurisdiction, the Special Rapporteur is 
concerned that bans on face coverings during assemblies are in some circumstances used to 
target particular groups and improperly curtail their right to freedom of peaceful assembly.  
</p>
<p>33. There may be legitimate and non-criminal reasons for wearing a mask or face 
covering during a demonstration, including fear of retribution. For example, in Egypt, 
article 6 of the 2013 law on protests and demonstrations prohibits the wearing of a mask to 
hide the face during any assembly. That provision contains no exceptions and could be used 
to discriminate against women who wear the niqab, effectively preventing them from 
participating in public meetings or protests. Such laws may also be used against individuals 
with medical disabilities who wear face masks for medical purposes. Certain peaceful 
protest movements in the Arab world, Western Europe, North America and elsewhere have 
adopted the use of the Guy Fawkes mask as an emblem. The mask is particularly popular 
among youth and student protest movements. The donning of this mask can be as much a 
political statement &#8212; a way of identifying with one&#8217;s fellow demonstrators and a 
worldwide movement &#8212; as it is an attempt to conceal identity.  
</p>
<p>34. Individuals with disabilities frequently face difficulty in staging peaceful assemblies 
due to limitations related to their disabilities. Those obstacles include the inability to gain 
access to the forms and notification procedures (for example, due to a lack of regulations or 
forms in Braille or other accessible formats) and to Government offices where a notification 
of assembly may be lodged. In that respect, the Special Rapporteur urges States to strive for 
implementation of article 19 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 
which called for States to recognize the equal right of all persons with disabilities to live in 
the community, with choices equal to others, and to take effective and appropriate measures 
to facilitate full enjoyment by persons with disabilities of that right and their full inclusion 
and participation in the community. Similarly, a lack of multilingual forms may also pose 
an obstacle to indigenous and minority groups and any other individuals or groups not 
fluent in the primary language of the local jurisdiction. 
</p><p>35. Moreover, the assemblies of religious, ethnic and cultural minorities have been 
selectively targeted. In Rakhine State, Myanmar, for example, Emergency Act 144 was 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>20 
 See, for example A/HRC/19/40, para. 17. </p>


<p>applied in June 2012 to prevent groups of five or more people from gathering in public 
areas. The Act was imposed following severe riots between Rohingya Muslims, a 
predominantly stateless ethnic group in western Rakhine State, and Buddhists in the area. 
The ban on public gatherings, however, has reportedly only been enforced against 
Rohingya. The ban has been extended numerous times, and was still in effect at the time of 
the drafting of the present report. The ban has also prevented Rohingya from gathering in 
local mosques to pray and celebrate religious festivals; Buddhists religious gatherings have 
reportedly not been disrupted. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Other legal provisions that have a disproportionate impact on the right to freedom 
of assembly of some groups  
</b></p>
<p>36. In some States, laws of general application may have a disproportionate impact on 
the assembly rights of certain groups, whether intentionally or inadvertently. For example, 
laws governing the prevention and combating of offences linked to information and 
communications technology have the potential to be applied in ways that hinder the 
organization of peaceful assemblies. Youth, being the largest demographic of social media 
users, are particularly affected by restrictive Internet access policies. The Special 
Rapporteur warns that restrictions to information and communications technologies should 
be applied exceptionally. The general norm should be to permit the open and free use of the 
Internet and other forms of communications (A/HRC/23/39, para. 76). 
</p><p>37. The Special Rapporteur has found that citizenship and residency status frequently 
affect assembly rights, often by design. As noted above, a number of States, including 
Singapore, Malaysia and Myanmar, formally deny the right to freedom of peaceful 
assembly to non-citizens. The Special Rapporteur finds no basis in international law for 
completely divesting non-citizens of their assembly rights. The right to freedom of peaceful 
assembly is particularly important for non-citizens and migrants, who may lack other 
mechanisms with which to advance their political, social and economic interests.  
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur also notes with concern that citizenship laws are, by their 
nature, frequently politicized and often drafted by dominant groups and thus provide an 
inherently problematic basis for denying the assembly rights of non-dominant groups. One 
of the more disturbing cases that the Special Rapporteur has examined is the situation of 
some 700,000 members of the Rohingya minority in Myanmar. The origins of the 
Rohingya people are controversial; some historians claim that the group dates back 
centuries, while others claim that the group largely comprises descendants of migrants who 
arrived during the British colonial period. Yet under Myanmar law, Rohingya are 
considered &#8220;non-nationals&#8221; and do not have citizenship rights. By extension, they have no 
right to peaceful public assembly under domestic law. 
</p>
<p>39. Problems can arise even in States where the assembly rights of non-citizens are 
protected by law. The Special Rapporteur has received reports that in Cyprus, for example, 
some private employment contracts prohibit migrants from engaging in political activity, 
effectively depriving that group of their right to peacefully assemble (and freely associate). 
Although provisions contained in private employment contracts do not represent direct 
restrictions from the State, the State does have an important and pivotal role in prohibiting 
such restrictions, that is, by rejecting such restrictions as valid contractual terms under 
domestic law. The Special Rapporteur recalls that Member States have a responsibility to 
facilitate and protect the right to freedom of peaceful assembly. States should closely 
examine their role in supporting, even if inadvertently, private restrictions on that right. 
State mechanisms and institutions must not be used to enable private actors to abrogate 
fundamental rights.  
</p>
<p>40. Persons with disabilities may be excluded from organizing and participating in 
assemblies, for example, due to laws and policies that fail to provide reasonable </p>


<p>accommodation for their specific needs. Physical barriers, such as a lack of access to public 
buildings and amenities such as transportation, distances that must be travelled to gather at 
officially sanctioned protest sites, and a lack of accommodation for facilitated 
communication, including in the online environment, may hinder the participation of 
persons with disabilities in peaceful gatherings. As stated previously, the practice of 
kettling &#8212; when police form large cordons and contain a crowd within a limited area, 
either preventing protesters from leaving or allowing only one exit &#8212; is &#8220;intrinsically 
detrimental to the exercise of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly, due to its 
indiscriminate and disproportionate nature&#8221; (A/HRC/23/39/Add.1, para. 37). In that regard, 
it may be particularly detrimental to individuals with disabilities, especially if those 
disabilities affect mobility. Societal attitudes that promote a lack of understanding or 
accommodation for persons with disabilities also constitute a significant barrier to their 
exercise of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Practices that threaten or impede the enjoyment of the right to freedom  
of peaceful assembly  
</b></p>
<p>41. Finally, some groups face a greater risk of discrimination and retribution when 
exercising their assembly rights due to practices which are not explicitly contained in the 
law (and which may, in fact, deviate from the law). In Indonesia for example, religious 
minority groups such as Ahmadis (the Ahmadiyah), Baha&#8217;is, Christians and Shias face 
physical attacks from militant Islamic groups with little intervention from the Government. 
Despite a Supreme Court ruling upholding the right of the Taman Yasmin Indonesian 
Christian Church congregation to put up their church building, in Bogor, West Java, local 
authorities sealed the building in 2010 and, since then, have prevented church members 
from gaining access to their church.  
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned about the use of police violence, 
harassment and judicial intimidation against assemblies held by women in many parts of 
the world. In Cambodia, for example, female land-rights activists have been targeted for 
violence, harassment and arrest on numerous occasions. In India, in the State of Orissa, 42 
women human rights defenders were arrested and detained for peacefully protesting against 
the building of a dam. In Sri Lanka, women advocating for investigations into the enforced 
disappearance of their loved ones face considerable opposition from the Government. In 
Cuba, women defenders promoting and protecting human rights (Damas de Blanco) have 
repeatedly been targeted by security forces when peacefully demonstrating for the rights of 
detainees. Similarly, in Zimbabwe, members of a local women&#8217;s group, Women of 
Zimbabwe Arise, were beaten and arrested in September 2013 after staging a peaceful 
demonstration outside Parliament.  
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur reminds Member States that the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women guarantees the equality of men 
and women in the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, 
economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field (art. 1). Cultural notions, family 
obligations and perceived vulnerability should never be used as grounds on which to deny 
or limit the right of women to assembly.  
</p>
<p>44. Moreover, arbitrary differences in the policing of peaceful assemblies are a concern 
in some Member States. In 2012, for example, the Minister for Ethics and Integrity of 
Uganda allegedly intervened to disrupt two private civil society workshops: one on the 
monitoring of human rights violations, and another on the human rights of LGBTI people. 
Participants say that both workshops were targeted because they addressed the rights of 
LGBTI people.  
</p>
<p>45. Surveillance tactics ostensibly designed to prevent criminal activity are also often 
used selectively to target certain groups who plan to stage peaceful public assemblies. In </p>


<p>Canada, for example, the Government formed a special police unit to produce intelligence 
updates on potential protests by indigenous peoples, primarily those fighting outside 
development on their ancestral land. Similarly, disproportionate force (including armed 
police, snipers and roadblocks) is often deployed at disfavoured protests as an intimidation 
tactic. Such practices should be vigorously discouraged. As the Special Rapporteur has 
previously noted, public assemblies should be presumed to be peaceful and lawful, until 
proven otherwise (A/HRC/20/27, para. 25) Surveillance tactics and disproportionate shows 
of force attest that authorities in some Member States often presume the opposite, and have 
a chilling effect on peaceful protestors, such as in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland (A/HRC/23/39/Add.1, para. 32).  
</p><p>46. In other cases, inaction by authorities may prevent some groups from exercising 
their right to freedom of peaceful assembly. The Special Rapporteur has received numerous 
reports from India regarding the disruption of public assemblies of Dalit individuals &#8212; 
members of the country&#8217;s traditional &#8220;untouchable&#8221; caste. This includes one case in 2009 in 
which members of another caste obstructed a funeral procession and beat members of the 
Dalit community. Police reportedly failed to intervene, despite being present. In Egypt, 
peaceful female demonstrators were sexually assaulted repeatedly in Tahir Square, largely 
due to the inaction of law enforcement authorities. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, unidentified 
individuals violently disrupted LGBTI events in 2008 and 2014. In both cases, the police 
failed to provide protection to the organizers and participants. In several countries, 
stigmatization and counter-demonstrations against LGBTI pride parades and marches have 
also dissuaded organizers from holding such events. 
</p>
<p>47. Other practices not directly related to the right to freedom of peaceful assembly may 
also be used as leverage to keep certain groups from freely exercising such right. Those 
practices include the expulsion of students from universities for participating in peaceful 
protests (for example, in Chile), the arrest and detention of, and excessive use of force 
against, peaceful Tibetan students calling for freedom to study the Tibetan language 
(China), the threat of revocation of residency, refugee or asylum status for participating in 
peaceful demonstrations, the existence of institutional obstacles that prevent demonstrators 
from receiving competent legal assistance if charged with an assembly-related crime 
(including the harassment and intimidation of lawyers who provide such assistance), and 
the threat of termination of employment (and legal residency status linked to employment 
in some circumstances) for participating in peaceful protests, for foreigners and migrants.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Challenges to the enjoyment of the right to freedom of association 
by groups most at risk 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Legislation governing freedom of association that contains explicitly discriminatory 
provisions 
</b></p>
<p>48. Legislation that explicitly excludes individuals or groups from forming associations 
on the basis of prohibited grounds constitutes a violation of the rights of those groups. For 
example, migrant workers are explicitly prohibited from forming trade unions in Singapore, 
and they are not allowed to join or form unions in the Plurinational State of Bolivia 
(CMW/C/BOL/CO/2, para. 34). In some instances non-nationals are allowed to join 
existing trade unions or labour associations but are not allowed to hold office in those 
associations, as in Singapore. However, the restriction on forming their own associations 
deprives migrants of autonomy and vehicles through which to advocate or promote issues 
of concern that may differ from those of nationals.  
</p>
<p>49. Some laws limit the type of associations that individuals or groups can join or form. 
The Committee on the Rights of the Child has noted with concern that in Costa Rica, the </p>


<p>Children and Adolescents Code denied adolescents the right to form or join political 
associations, yet they may form community development associations in which they may 
actively participate (CRC/C/CRI/CO/4, para. 37). In Turkey, children over the age of 15 may 
form associations and from the age of 12 may join those associations, but they must be 19 in 
order to form an organizational committee for outdoor meetings (CRC/C/TUR/CO/2-3, 
para. 38). The justification for explicitly excluding those groups from forming associations 
that engage in certain activities is unclear.  
</p>
<p>50. In an example of good practice, the Supreme Court of Estonia found the provisions 
of the Non-Profit Associations Act that restricted the right to form and lead associations to 
persons over the age of 18 years old to be in contravention of article 15 of the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child.  
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the increasing incidents of racism and 
incitement to racism in various regions of the world. He further notes the absence, in 
several States, of laws prohibiting and criminalizing the formation of associations that 
promote racism and discrimination as required by article 4 of the International Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. This constitutes a serious 
omission in the protection of the right to freedom of association. The Special Rapporteur 
emphasizes that this provision is a key protection against organizations that target groups 
most at risk of discrimination, such as minorities, indigenous peoples and non-citizens. 
While noting that the involuntary dissolution of associations should be a measure of last 
resort, he agrees with the European Court of Human Rights that the dissolution of an 
association that engages in racist activities constitutes a justifiable limitation of the freedom 
of association.21 Moreover, the Special Rapporteur endorses the view that the 
criminalization of the dissemination of racism, xenophobia or ethnic intolerance, and the 
dissolution of every group, organization, association or party that promotes them, are 
peremptory norms from which no derogation is allowed.22  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Legal provisions on freedom of association that are stated generally  
but have a disproportionately negative impact on certain groups 
</b></p>
<p>52. Legislation requiring associations to adhere to a State ideology, principles or 
religion can be used to exclude individuals and groups that do not subscribe to that 
ideology, principles or religion. In Indonesia for example, the Law on Mass Organizations 
requires that the objectives of associations do not contradict State principles (Pancasila), thus excluding groups, including minorities, that may not agree with those principles<i>.</i>23  
</p>
<p>53. Registration requirements for associations may have a disproportionate effect on 
certain groups most at risk, making it harder for them to form associations. For example, 
minority groups may face difficulties in forming associations that aim to protect and 
preserve their culture in a State that seeks to suppress ethnic minority identity or interprets 
minority consciousness as a means for minority groups to undermine territorial integrity. 
The Special Rapporteur echoes the jurisprudence of the European Court on Human Rights

<p>affirming the legitimacy of associations formed to promote issues of concern to minorities 
for historical and economic reasons.24 
</p>
<p>54. The process of registering an association may prove to be cumbersome for 
marginalized groups and exclude groups such minorities or persons with disabilities. For 
example, the language used to communicate could be inaccessible, and physical access to 
locations for registration could also be a challenge for those groups. Mandatory registration, 
particularly where authorities have broad discretion to grant or deny registration, provides 
an opportunity for the State to refuse or delay registration to groups that do not espouse 
&#8220;favourable&#8221; views. Associations formed to defend human rights, engage in civic 
awareness, and to lobby and advocate are susceptible to such delays and denials, as has 
reportedly been the case in the Sudan. 
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that the right to freedom of association applies 
equally to associations that are not registered (A/HRC/20/27, para. 96). He endorses as best 
practice a voluntary registration regime that permits unregistered associations to operate. 
The Special Rapporteur notes with approval the recent ruling by a magistrate&#8217;s court in 
Zimbabwe, quashing charges of running an unregistered organization preferred against a 
member of the Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe association. 
</p>
<p>56. Nevertheless, where a registration regime exists, requirements should be framed 
such that no one is disadvantaged in the formation of her or his association, either by 
burdensome procedural requirements or unjustifiable limitations to substantive activities of 
associations. The State has an obligation to take positive measures to overcome specific 
challenges that confront marginalized groups, such as indigenous peoples, minorities, 
persons with disabilities, women and youth, in their efforts to form associations.25 
</p>
<p>57. Funding restrictions, including restrictions on foreign funding, may 
disproportionately affect associations that promote issues that do not enjoy popularity or the 
support of the State or the majority of the population, including those that relate to the 
advancement of the rights of marginalized groups. This is evidenced by the dichotomy that 
some States impose regarding association funding sources: certain types of activities or 
organizations are permitted to receive foreign funding while others only receive domestic 
funding. For instance, to be considered an Ethiopian charity or society, organizations 
cannot receive more than 10 per cent of their funding from foreign sources. Only Ethiopian 
charities or societies may engage in promoting human rights work, gender equality and 
religious equality, the rights of persons with disabilities, children&#8217;s rights, conflict 
resolution or reconciliation and the efficiency of the justice and law enforcement services. 
Foreign associations or those that receive more than 10 per cent of their funding from 
foreign sources may not engage in such activities. In the Russian Federation, an 
organization working on &#8220;political activities&#8221; and receiving foreign funding must register 
itself as a &#8220;foreign agent&#8221;, which in Russian is synonymous with &#8220;foreign spy&#8221;. The law 
broadly defines political activities as attempts to influence official decision-making or to 
shape public opinion to exert a similar influence, and thus can include work in areas such as 
human rights, governance and accountability issues. 
</p>
<p>58. Legislation that provides broad discretion to authorities to monitor or oversee the 
activities of associations poses a grave risk to the continued existence of organizations that 
engage in activities perceived to be threatening to the State. Groups that advocate against 
the unsustainable use of natural resources or the use of those resources contrary to the rights 
of indigenous peoples are often targeted and risk closure, as happened to Fundaci&#243;n

<p>Pachamama in Ecuador pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 16. The Special Rapporteur 
emphasizes that associations are entitled to operational autonomy, which includes the 
freedom to choose which activities they engage in to achieve organizational goals. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Other legal provisions that have a disproportionate impact on the right to freedom 
of association of some groups 
</b></p>
<p>59. The use of national security or counter-terrorism legislation to restrict or prohibit the 
formation or registration of associations is often detrimental to the right to freedom of 
association of minority groups. Under the guise of fighting terrorism or extremism, 
associations comprised of minorities, including religious, linguistic or ethnic minorities, may 
be subjected to delays in registration, denial of registration, harassment and interference. Such 
associations may be seen as promoting or propagating views or beliefs not shared by the 
majority of the population or that are unfavourable to the authorities. The Special Rapporteur 
recognizes that States have a legitimate obligation to protect their national security and public 
safety. However, this legitimate interest should never be used as an excuse to silence critical 
or diverse voices. States must treat all associations equitably, regardless of their views, and 
this treatment must be guided by objective criteria that comply with international human 
rights law, where a registration regime exists. In Chile, members of the Mapuche indigenous 
community have been targeted under counter-terrorism legislation when advocating for the 
rights of their community. In Turkey, peaceful Kurdish activists advocating for the rights of 
their community have been arrested and sentenced to prison for allegedly belonging to an 
association considered to be a terrorist group. 
</p>
<p>60. Criminal procedure laws and penal sanctions are used in several States to deter the 
exercise of the right to freedom of association. Authorities who are hostile to critical voices 
resort to criminal prosecution for defamation or similar offences, thereby discouraging and 
interfering with legitimate activities by groups. Organizations engaged in human rights 
work, anti-corruption advocacy and other accountability initiatives are particularly targeted. 
In Oman, between May and June 2012, 11 human rights defenders, including bloggers, 
writers, and members of human rights organizations and of the media, were sentenced for 
offences related to injurious speech and assembly. They were all pardoned on 22 March 
</p><p>2013. In Viet Nam, in March 2013, the police charged a human rights defender with slander 
against the regime. The authorities asserted that he had not expressed his opinions in a 
peaceful manner and that he had thus disturbed the public order. The country&#8217;s Press Law 
of 1989 limits the right to express dissent, restricting it to &#8220;constructive&#8221; opinions on 
implementing the lines and policies of the Communist Party and the laws of the States law. 
In El Salvador, article 345 of the Criminal Code considers as illegal two or more people 
gathering to commit a crime. Despite the necessity to prove intent to commit a crime, law 
enforcement officials often stop and detain young people simply because it is believed that 
they are gathering to organize or plan a crime, or that they belong to a gang merely because 
they have a tattoo, are young, live in a particular neighbourhood where there is gang 
presence or are poor. Youth are additionally disproportionately affected because criminal 
groups force them to join their ranks, thereby violating their right to freedom of association. 
61. The right to freedom of association extends to cross-border or international 
collaboration between associations and their membership. Indeed, the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples acknowledges the right of indigenous 
peoples divided by international borders to maintain and develop contacts, relations and 
cooperation, including activities for spiritual, cultural, political, economic and social 
purposes, with their own members as well as other peoples across borders (art. 36).26 That

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>26 
 See also the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and 
Linguistic Minorities, art. 2, para. 5. </p>


<p>right can, however, be in tension with laws regulating cross-border activities such as 
immigration and trade. For example, pastoralist communities whose territories or means of 
livelihood straddle international borders often do not use formal border crossing points or 
possess the necessary administrative documentation such as passports. The Special 
Rapporteur is unconvinced that border control laws should automatically trump their ability 
to maintain their cultural lifestyles. He believes that States have an obligation to facilitate 
the free movement of such communities, including by adopting special measures 
recognizing cross-border movements in the context of transhumance. 
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur further decries the discriminative and disproportionate use 
of immigration laws by States to deny residence or work permits to staff of associations that 
are critical of the Government or that express views that are unpopular with the 
Government. 
</p>
<p>63. As stated by the Human Rights Council, in its resolution 24/5, the right to freedom 
of association applies both online and offline. As such, laws that unjustifiably restrict 
freedom of expression on the Internet and limit the ability of people to associate over that 
medium are unacceptable. With youth being the most active social media users overall, 
restrictions placed on access to social media sites will disproportionately affect their ability 
to organize and mobilize for their common interests. The perception that youth in general 
lacks maturity and are therefore incapable of participating fully in public affairs often forms 
the backdrop against which some Governments feel the need to filter and dictate media 
content made available in their countries.  
</p>
<p>64. In addition to legislation that restricts the right to the freedom of assembly of LGBTI 
people through discriminatory law that prohibits &#8220;propaganda&#8221; or the &#8220;promotion&#8221; of 
homosexuality, some legislation also specifically prohibits the formation, running, 
participation in or support of organizations that advocate for the protection of the human 
rights of LGBTI people. This is the case of the above-mentioned Same Sex Marriage 
(Prohibition) Act in Nigeria. The Special Rapporteur highlights that the Human Rights 
Committee has clarified that any limitations to rights protected by the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, when permitted by the Covenant, may not be 
imposed for discriminatory purposes or applied in a discriminatory manner. Therefore, 
provisions restricting or prohibiting the right to freedom of association of a specific group 
on discriminatory grounds, such as sexual orientation or gender identity, is not permitted 
under the Covenant and must be reviewed with a view to repeal.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Practices threatening and impeding the enjoyment of the right to freedom 
of association 
</b></p>
<p>65. The lived experiences of members of groups most at risk may be problematic even 
where legislation promotes equality and non-discrimination, due to practices that threaten 
and impede the enjoyment of the right to freedom of association. Such practices can lead to 
the marginalization of groups already disadvantaged in their exercise of the right to 
freedom of association. The conditions of work for migrant domestic workers, for example, 
are often characterized by isolation and dependence. This is reinforced by unfamiliarity 
with the work environment of the host country and a lack of basic support structures, which 
then encourage bad practices by employers, such as restricting the freedom to leave the 
workplace. Women migrant workers face gender-based violence and abuse, and migrant 
domestic workers in irregular situations are further at risk of deportation. They are therefore 
even less likely to speak out against exploitation and abuse. In these circumstances, migrant 
workers are faced with considerable obstacles in their efforts to form associations that cater 
for their interests. Refugees and asylum seekers find themselves in a similar situation where 
the fear of their status being revoked has a chilling effect on their ability to mobilize. </p>


<p>66. Patriarchal attitudes and stereotypes in societies that promote a narrow 
understanding of the role of women as being confined to the private sphere militate against 
the ability of women to organize and participate in activities in the public sphere. Thus, the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has expressed concern at 
the harassment, intimidation and imprisonment of members of women&#8217;s NGOs and women 
human rights defenders and at restrictions placed on the activities of organizations focused 
on gender equality (see, for example, CEDAW/C/UZB/CO/4, paras. 17&#8211;18). Similarly, the 
Working Group on the issue of discrimination against women in law and in practice found 
that women&#8217;s participation in political and public life is commonly constrained by 
structural and societal discrimination in the family, in caregiving responsibilities and in 
violence against women, and by marginalization by political parties and other non-State 
public institutions. The obligation of States to remove those barriers is clearly mandated in 
article 2 (f) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women and has been repeatedly advocated by the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women (A/HRC/23/50, para. 56). Despite laws prohibiting caste 
discrimination and positive measures to reverse the impact of discrimination and violence, 
the Dalit population in India continues to face severe social restrictions in participating on 
an equal footing with others in political parties and associations.  
</p>
<p>67. Some groups are denied registration or the renewal of their existing registration, in 
contravention of laws that outline the procedures to be followed in registering associations. 
This is allegedly the case in Viet Nam, where a majority of Hmong Christian house 
churches have been denied registration and are therefore unable to operate. The authorities 
do not consider them to be a &#8220;true&#8221; religion and instead characterize them as carrying out 
anti-Government activities. The Special Rapporteur aligns himself with the sentiments of 
the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief &#8220;that freedom of religion or belief is 
not limited to members of registered religious communities and that registration may only 
be appropriate for the acquisition of a legal personality and related benefits&#8221; (A/64/159, 
para. 13). He emphasizes that it is the duty of the State to ensure that everyone can 
peacefully express their views without fear. 
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur believes that the right to freedom of association should be 
available for everyone to exercise. This includes the freedom of Governments to form 
government-organized NGOs or for organizations to closely align with Government. 
However, he deplores the practice of restricting the formation of autonomous associations 
so that civic space is monopolized by government-organized NGOs. Civic space should be 
an environment in which diverse organizations are allowed to operate, compete and 
cooperate without interference or control by authorities. Where the space of operation by 
autonomous associations is limited, marginalized groups are all the more constrained in 
how they establish and operate associations. 
</p>
<p>69. In its draft general comment on article 12, the Committee on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities states that the recognition of equal legal capacity for persons with 
disabilities is a key principle that is inextricably linked to the enjoyment of other rights, 
including the freedom of association and the right to participate in political and public life 
(CRPD/C/11/4, paras. 44&#8211;45). Legal capacity is distinguished from mental capacity, with 
the former referring to the ability to hold rights and duties and the ability to exercise those 
rights and duties (ibid., para. 12). The paradigm shift in perceptions of the legal capacity 
and equality before the law for persons with disabilities, brought about by the Committee 
on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, has not yet become entrenched in practice. The 
shift from substitute decision-making to supported decision-making has profound 
implications on how and with whom persons with disabilities associate.  
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur recognizes the severe impact that the diagnosis of disability 
can have on the right to freedom of association. Too often, persons with disabilities are </p>


<p>deprived of their autonomy to exercise their voting rights and to choose who to marry, where 
to live and how to relate to others in the community because of perceived or actual 
deficiencies in mental capacity and decision-making ability. Persons suffering from cognitive 
or psychosocial disabilities, and often children and young persons with these disabilities, are 
most at risk of being deprived of their legal capacity and equal treatment under the law. The 
Special Rapporteur urges States to take measures to ensure that no one is at any time deprived 
of their legal capacity due to their disability. Instead, support should be provided to enhance 
their capacity to exercise the rights and duties that they hold as human beings. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>71. <b>The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that the rights to freedom of peaceful 
assembly and of association are due to everyone without distinction, within the 
territories of States and subject to their jurisdiction, and may not be limited on any of 
the prohibited grounds that the Human Rights Committee has indicated are covered 
by article 2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Freedom from 
discrimination is also due to those who advocate and lobby on behalf of groups most 
at risk.  
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association play a key role in 
empowering individuals belonging to groups most at risk to claim other rights and 
overcome the challenges associated with marginalization. Such rights must therefore 
not only be protected, but also facilitated. It is the responsibility of all stakeholders to 
ensure that the voices of individuals belonging to groups most at risk are heard, and 
taken into account, in compliance with the principles of pluralism of views, tolerance, 
broadmindedness and equity.  
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>In that regard, the Special Rapporteur calls upon States to: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Ratify all relevant international human rights instruments that protect 
the rights of individuals belonging to groups most at risk;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Take all necessary measures to ensure that discrimination on prohibited 
grounds is eliminated, including in legislation or in practice, whether perpetrated by 
the State or by non-State actors; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Take positive measures, including affirmative action measures, to ensure 
that all individuals belonging to groups most at risk have the ability to exercise 
effectively their rights, including to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Refrain from supporting limitations imposed by private parties on the 
rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, particularly those that 
disproportionately affect groups most at risk. A private contractual provision in 
which a contracting party waives the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
association should be considered invalid and unenforceable as an infringement upon a 
fundamental right. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>In relation to recommendations pertaining to the exercise of the rights to 
freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, the Special Rapporteur reiterates all 
the recommendations contained in his previous thematic reports.</b>27<b> They are all the 
more relevant for individuals belonging to groups most at risk whose rights are more 
likely to be violated or unduly restricted. In particular, he calls upon States to: 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>27 
 A/HRC/20/27 (paras. 84&#8211;100), A/HRC/23/39 (paras. 81&#8211;83) and A/68/299 (paras. 58&#8211;64). </p>


<p><b> (a) Ensure that no individual belonging to a group most at risk is 
criminalized for exercising his/her rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
association, nor is subject to threats or use of violence, harassment, persecution, 
intimidation or reprisals;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Ensure that any restrictions on the rights of individuals belonging to 
groups most at risk to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association are prescribed 
by law, necessary in a democratic society and proportional to the aim pursued, and do 
not harm the principles of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness. Any restrictions 
should be subject to an independent, impartial and prompt judicial review;  
 (c) Ensure that no derogation is made from the rights to life and to be free 
from torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of 
individuals belonging to groups most at risk;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Provide individuals belonging to groups most at risk exercising their 
rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association with the protection offered 
by the right to freedom of expression;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Ensure that administrative and law enforcement officials are adequately 
trained in relation to the respect of the rights of individuals belonging to groups most 
at risk to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, in particular in relation to 
their specific protection needs;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Ensure that law enforcement authorities who violate the rights of 
individuals belonging to groups at risk to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
association are held personally and fully accountable for such violations by an 
independent and democratic oversight body and by the courts of law; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Ensure that individuals belonging to groups most at risk who are victims 
of violations and abuse of their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
association have the right to a timely and effective remedy and obtain redress. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls upon national human rights institutions 
complying with the Paris Principles to play a key role in monitoring and publicly 
reporting on the fulfilment by the States of the above-mentioned recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The Special Rapporteur again encourages the Human Rights Committee to 
consider adopting general comments on articles 21 and 22 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, with a particular focus on the related 
challenges faced by individuals belonging to groups most at risk. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls upon the General Assembly and the Human 
Rights Council to address thoroughly human rights violations and abuse suffered by 
individuals belonging to groups most at risk when exercising or seeking to exercise 
their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls upon the diplomatic community and other 
relevant stakeholders to publicly denounce violations and abuses committed against 
those individuals belonging to groups most at risk exercising or seeking to exercise 
their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, and to provide 
support to those victims.
