BULLFROG GOLD CORP.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(unaudited)
NOTE 1 - NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES
Nature of Business
Bullfrog Gold Corp. (the “Company”) is a junior exploration company engaged in the acquisition
and exploration of properties that may contain gold, silver and other metals in the United States.
The Company’s target properties are those that have been the subject of historical exploration.
The Company owns, controls or has acquired mineral rights on State lands, private lands and
Federal patented and unpatented mining claims in the state of Nevada for the purpose of
exploration and potential development of gold, silver and other metals on a total of approximately
2,200 acres. The Company plans to review opportunities and acquire additional mineral
properties with current or historic precious and base metal mineralization with meaningful
exploration potential.
The Company’s properties do not have any proven reserves. The Company plans to conduct
exploration programs on these properties with the objective of ascertaining whether any of its
properties contain economic concentrations of precious and base metals that are prospective for
mining.
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated unaudited financial statements included in this Form 10-Q have been prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America for
interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, these financial
statements do not include all of the disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles for complete financial statements. These consolidated unaudited interim financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2015 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The financial information
furnished herein reflects all adjustments consisting of normal, recurring adjustments which, in the
opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position, the results
of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Operating results for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results for future quarters or
periods in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Bullfrog Gold Corp. and its wholly
owned subsidiaries, Standard Gold Corp. (“Standard Gold”) a Nevada corporation and Rocky
Mountain Minerals Corp. (“Rocky Mountain Minerals”) a Nevada corporation. All significant inter-
entity balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Going Concern and Management’s Plans
The Company has incurred losses from operations since inception and has an accumulated
deficit of approximately $7,580,041 as of June 30, 2016.  The Company’s financial statements
have been prepared on the basis that it is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of
assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company’s
continuation as a going concern is dependent upon attaining profitable operations through
achieving revenue growth.
The Company has no revenues and does not expect to have revenues in 2016. Should we be
unable to continue as a going concern, we may be unable to realize the carrying value of our
assets and to meet our obligations as they become due. To continue as a going concern, we are
dependent on continued fund raising. However, we have no commitment from any party to
provide additional capital and there is no assurance that such funding will be available when
needed, or if available, that its terms will be favorable or acceptable to us.
Cash and Cash Equivalents and Concentration
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less
when acquired to be cash equivalents. The Company places its cash with a high credit quality
financial institution. The Company’s account at this institution is insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation up to $250,000. At June 30, 2016, the Company’s cash balance was
approximately $30,000. To reduce its risk associated with the failure of such financial institution,
the Company will evaluate at least annually the rating of the financial institution in which it holds
deposits.
6
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Mineral Property Acquisition and Exploration Costs
Mineral property acquisition and exploration costs are expensed as incurred until such time as
economic reserves are quantified. To date, the Company has not established any proven or
probable reserves on its mineral properties. Costs of lease, exploration, carrying and retaining
unproven mineral lease properties are expensed as incurred. The Company has chosen to
expense all mineral exploration costs as incurred given that it is still in the exploration stage.
Once the Company has identified proven and probable reserves in its investigation of its
properties and upon development of a plan for operating a mine, it would enter the development
stage and capitalize future costs until production is established. When a property reaches the
production stage, the related capitalized costs will be amortized over the estimated life of the
probable-proven reserves. When the Company has capitalized mineral properties, these
properties will be periodically assessed for impairment of value and any diminution in value. To
date, the Company has not established the commercial feasibility of any exploration prospects;
therefore, all costs are being expensed. During the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
the Company did not incur exploration costs. Costs of property acquisitions are being capitalized,
and a required payment of $10,000 was made to Mojave as part of the option to purchase
agreement.
Deferred Financing Fees
In conjunction with the NPX Convertible Note (as discussed in Note 4) the Company paid
financing fees of approximately $22,000 in cash in April 2014. These fees were capitalized as
deferred financing fees and will be amortized over the life of the Note using the effective interest
method. Amortization of deferred financing fees included in interest expense during the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $3,666 and $5,500, respectively.
Fair Value Measurement
Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer
a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in
an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three
levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
Level 1 - Valuation based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and
liabilities.
Level 2 - Valuation based on quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active
markets.
Level 3 - Valuation based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market
activity, therefore requiring management’s best estimate of what market participants would use
as fair value.
The Company does not have any assets or liabilities measured using Level 1 or 2 inputs. The
Company’s Level 3 financial liabilities measured at fair value consisted of the warrant liability.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated
their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. These financial instruments
include cash, accounts payable, and other liabilities. The warrant liability, a long-term liability, is
already recorded at fair value. The fair values of the Company’s note payable is not practicable to
calculate due to the unique terms of the note.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC
740, "Income Taxes". Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as operating loss and tax credit carry
forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the periods in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are
reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that the recoverability of the asset is unlikely to be
recognized.
7
The Company reports a liability, if any, for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax
positions taken, or expected to be taken, in an income tax return. The Company has elected to
classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized income tax benefits, if and when required,
as part of income tax expense in the statement of operations. No liability has been recorded for
uncertain income tax positions, or related interest or penalties as of June 30, 2016 or December
31, 2015. The periods ended December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012 are open to examination
by taxing authorities.
Long Lived Assets
The Company assesses the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When the Company
determines that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the
existence of one or more indicators of impairment and the carrying value of the asset cannot be
recovered from projected undiscounted cash flows, the Company records an impairment charge.
The Company measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method
using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in
the current business model. Significant management judgment is required in determining
whether an indicator of impairment exists and in projecting cash flows.
Preferred Stock
The Company accounts for its preferred stock under the provisions of the ASC on Distinguishing
Liabilities from Equity, which sets forth the standards for how an issuer classifies and measures
certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. This standard
requires an issuer to classify a financial instrument that is within the scope of the standard as a
liability if such financial instrument embodies an unconditional obligation to redeem the
instrument at a specified date and/or upon an event certain to occur. The Company has
determined that its preferred stock does not meet the criteria requiring liability classification as its
obligation to redeem these instruments is not based on an event certain to occur. Future changes
in the certainty of the Company’s obligation to redeem these instruments could result in a change
in classification.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”), which requires
additional disclosures about the Company’s objectives and strategies for using derivative
instruments, how the derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for, and
how the derivative instruments and related hedging items affect the financial statements. The
Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market or foreign
currency risk. Terms of convertible debt and equity instruments are reviewed to determine
whether or not they contain embedded derivative instruments that are required under ASC 815 to
be accounted for separately from the host contract, and recorded on the balance sheet at fair
value. The fair value of derivative liabilities, if any, is required to be revalued at each reporting
date, with corresponding changes in fair value recorded in current period operating results.
Pursuant to ASC 815, an evaluation of specifically identified conditions is made to determine
whether the fair value of warrants issued is required to be classified as equity or as a derivative
liability.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based
Payment Topic of ASC 718 which requires recognition in the consolidated financial statements of
the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity
instruments over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in
exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). This ASC also requires
measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award
based on the grant-date fair value of the award.
The estimated fair value of each stock option as of the date of grant was calculated using the
Black-Scholes pricing model. The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock at the
date of grant based on the volatility of a comparable peer company which is publicly traded. The
Company determines the expected life based on historical experience with similar awards, giving
consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and post-vesting forfeitures. The
Company uses the risk-free interest rate on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury
issues with an equivalent remaining term approximately equal to the expected life of the award.
The Company has never paid any cash dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate
paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The shares of common stock subject to the
stock-based compensation plan shall consist of unissued shares, treasury shares or previously
issued shares held by any subsidiary of the Company, and such number of shares of common
stock are reserved for such purpose.

On March 31, 2015 we granted options to purchase 4,500,000 shares of our common stock of the
4,500,000 shares of common stock under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan.

11,000,000 of preferred shares issued on June 30, 2016 were not included in the computation of
diluted shares. 4,500,000 of stock options were included in the computation for the three months
ended June 30, 2016.  9,868,660 of warrants were not included in the diluted weighted average
shares calculation because they were “out-of-the money” for the three and six month period
ending June 30, 2016.  The NPX convertible loan can convert into shares of the Company’s
common shares at a conversion price equal to $0.25 per common share, this was not included in
the computation of diluted shares. In periods where the Company has a net loss, all common
stock equivalents are excluded as they would be anti-dilutive.
Risks and Uncertainties
Our limited operating history makes it difficult for potential investors to evaluate our business or
prospective operations. Since our formation, we have not generated any revenues. As an early
stage company, we are subject to all the risks inherent in the initial organization, financing,
expenditures, complications and delays inherent in a new business. Investors should evaluate
an investment in us in light of the uncertainties encountered by developing companies in a
competitive environment. Our business is dependent upon the implementation of our business
plan. There can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that we will ultimately be
able to attain profitability.
Natural resource exploration, and exploring for gold in particular, is a business that by its nature
is very speculative. There is a strong possibility that we will not discover gold or any other
resources which can be mined or extracted at a profit. Even if we do discover gold or other
deposits, the deposit may not be of the quality or size necessary for us or a potential purchaser of
the property to make a profit from actually mining it. Few properties that are explored are
ultimately developed into producing mines. Unusual or unexpected geological formations,
geological formation pressures, fires, power outages, labor disruptions, flooding, explosions,
cave-ins, landslides and the inability to obtain suitable or adequate machinery, equipment or
labor are just some of the many risks involved in mineral exploration programs and the
subsequent development of gold deposits.
Our business is exploring for gold and other minerals. In the event that we discover commercially
exploitable gold or other deposits, we will not be able to make any money from them unless the
gold or other minerals are actually mined or we sell all or a part of our interest. Accordingly, we
will need to find some other entity to mine our properties on our behalf, mine them ourselves or
sell our rights to mine to third parties. Mining operations in the United States are subject to many
different federal, state and local laws and regulations, including stringent environmental, health
and safety laws. In the event we assume any operational responsibility for mining our properties,
it is possible that we will be unable to comply with current or future laws and regulations, which
can change at any time. It is possible that changes to these laws will be adverse to any potential
mining operations. Moreover, compliance with such laws may cause substantial delays and
require capital outlays in excess of those anticipated, adversely affecting any potential mining
operations. Our future mining operations, if any, may also be subject to liability for pollution or
other environmental damage. It is possible that we will choose to not be insured against this risk
because of high insurance costs or other reasons.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
There are several new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB which are not yet
effective. Management does not believe any of these accounting pronouncements will be
applicable and therefore will not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or
operating results.

Option Agreement dated June 11, 2012 and amended May 6, 2015 for the Klondike Project in
Nevada.  The Company issued Larson 270,000 shares (valued at $14,850) of common stock as
full and final payment. The Company will have no further obligations.
On June 30, 2016, the Company has settled all debts and obligations with respect to a December
12, 2012 Facility Agreement with RMB Australia Holdings Limited (RMB). The principal and
interest due RMB under the Agreement as of June 30, 2016 was $2,843,813.  Components of the
payout were $250,000 of cash paid to RMB on June 30, 2016, which was raised from recent
private placements, and issuance of 1,000,000 shares of BFGC common stock on July 5, 2016
valued at $70,000.
Effective June 30, 2016, the Company sold an aggregate of 18,666,667 shares (11,000,000
preferred and 7,666,667 common) with gross proceeds to the Company of $280,000 to certain
accredited investors pursuant to a stock agreement.
Convertible Preferred Stock
In August 2011, the Board of Directors designated 5,000,000 shares of its Preferred Stock as
Series A Preferred Stock. Each share of Series A preferred stock par value $0.0001 per share
(“Preferred Stock”) is convertible into one share of common stock at the option of the preferred
holder. The Series A Preferred Stock is not entitled to receive dividends and does not possess
redemption rights. The Company is prohibited from effecting the conversion of the Series A
Preferred Stock to the extent that, as a result of the conversion, the holder of such shares
beneficially owns more than 4.99% (or, if this limitation is waived by the holder upon no less than
61 days prior notice to us, 9.99%) in the aggregate of the issued and outstanding shares of our
common stock calculated immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of common
stock upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock. The holders of the Company’s Series A
Preferred Stock are also entitled to certain liquidation preferences upon the liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the business of the Company.
In October 2012, the Board of Directors designated 5,000,000 shares of its Preferred Stock as
Series B Preferred Stock. In July 2016, the Board of Directors amended the total Series B
Preferred Stock to 45,000,000.  Each share of Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into one
share of common stock at the option of the preferred holder. The Series B Preferred Stock is not
entitled to receive dividends and does not possess redemption rights. The Company is prohibited
from effecting the conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock to the extent that, as a result of the
conversion, the holder of such shares beneficially owns more than 4.99% (or, if this limitation is
waived by the holder upon no less than 61 days prior notice to us, 9.99%) in the aggregate of the
issued and outstanding shares of our common stock calculated immediately after giving effect to
the issuance of shares of common stock upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock.
10
For a period of 24 months from the issue date, the holder of Series B Preferred Stock is entitled to
price protection as determined in the subscription agreement. The Company has evaluated this
embedded lower price issuance feature in accordance with ASC 815 and determined that is
clearly and closely related to the host contract and is therefore accounted for as an equity
instrument.
Effective June 30, 2016, the Company sold 11,000,000 series B preferred shares.
Common Stock Options
On September 30, 2011, the Board of Directors and stockholders adopted the 2011 Stock
Incentive Plan (the “2011 Plan”). Under the 2011 Plan, options may be granted which are
intended to qualify as Incentive Stock Options under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986 (the "Code") or which are not intended to qualify as Incentive Stock Options thereunder.
In addition, direct grants of stock or restricted stock may be awarded. The 2011 Plan has
reserved 4,500,000 shares of common stock for issuance.
There were a total of 4,500,000 options granted from the 2011 Plan in March 2015 (the “March
2015 Options”).  These options issued are nonqualified stock options and were 100% vested on
grant date. All expense related to these stock options has been recognized.

NOTE 3 - DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
In applying current accounting standards to the financial instruments issued in the 2012 Private
Placement, February 2013 Private Placement, August 2013 Private Placement and October
2013 Private Placement, the Company first considered the classification of the Series A and
Series B Preferred Stock under ASC 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, and the Warrants
under ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging. The Series A and Series B Preferred Stock is
perpetual preferred stock without redemption or dividend provisions, contingent or otherwise.
Further, the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into a fixed number of shares of
Common Stock with adjustments to the conversion price solely associated with equity
restructuring events such a stock splits and recapitalization. Generally redemption provisions that
provide for the mandatory payment of cash to the Investor to settle the contract or certain
provisions that cause the number of linked shares of Common Stock to vary result in liability
classification; and, in some instances, classification outside of stockholders’ equity. There being
no such provisions associated with the Series A or Series B Preferred Stock, it is classified as a
component of stockholders’ equity.
The warrants were also evaluated for purposes of classification. The warrants issued contain a
feature that is not consistent with the concept of stockholders’ equity. The exercise price of the
warrants is subject to adjustment upon the issuance of common stock or common share linked
contracts at prices below the contractual exercise prices. The 2012 Private Placement and
February 2013 Private Placement warrants price adjustment expires four years after the date of
issuance. The August 2013 Private Placement and October 2013 Private Placement warrants
were amended on December 2, 2013 and allows for a price adjustment that expires three years
after the date of original issuance. Current accounting standards provide that such provisions are
not consistent with the concept of stockholders’ equity. As a result, all warrants with price
adjustment features require classification in liability as derivative warrants. Derivative warrants
are carried initially at fair value (up to the value of cash received) and subsequently at fair value
with changes in fair value reflected in income.

The estimated fair value of the warrants was calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model,
however we concluded the estimated fair value of the warrants was not material and does not
require separate disclosure of calculation inputs.
Warrants contain limitations on exercise, including the limitation that the holders may not convert
their warrants to the extent that upon exercise the holder, together with its affiliates, would own in
excess of 4.99% of our outstanding shares of common stock (subject to an increase upon at least
61-days’ notice by the subscriber to us, of up to 9.99%).
The second classification-related accounting consideration related to the possibility that the
conversion option embedded in the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock may require
classification outside of stockholders’ equity. Generally, an embedded feature in a hybrid
financial instrument (such as the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock) that both meets the
definition of a derivative financial instrument and is not clearly and closely related to the host
contract in term of risks would require bifurcation and accounting under derivative standards. The
embedded conversion option is a feature that embodies risks of equity. The Company has
concluded that the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock is a contract that affords solely equity
risks.

NOTE 4 - NOTES PAYABLE
RMB Facility
On December 10, 2012 (the “Closing Date”), the Company entered into the Facility with RMB, as
the lender, in the amount of $4,200,000. The loan proceeds from the Facility were used to fund
an agreed work program relating to the Newsboy gold project located in Arizona and for agreed
general corporate purposes. Standard Gold the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary is the
borrower under the Facility and the Company is the guarantor of Standard Gold’s obligations
under the Facility. Standard Gold paid an arrangement fee of 7% of the Facility amount due upon
the first draw down of the Facility. The Facility funds were available to drawdown until March 31,
2014 with the final repayment date due 24 months after the Closing Date, which was December
10, 2014. The Facility bears interest at the rate of LIBOR plus 7% with interest payable quarterly
in cash.
On December 15, 2014, RMB amended the Facility to extend the repayment date to December
15, 2015. All interest accrued but unpaid as of December 15, 2014 was capitalized and added to
the outstanding principal balance. On December 15, 2015, RMB amended the Facility to extend
the repayment date to December 15, 2016.
As stated in Note 2, on June 30, 2016, the Company has settled all debts and obligations with
respect to the Facility Agreement with RMB. The principal and interest due RMB under the
Agreement as of June 30, 2016 was $2,843,813.  Components of the payout were $250,000 of
cash paid to RMB on June 30, 2016, which was raised from recent private placements, and
issuance of 1,000,000 shares of BFGC common stock with a value of $70,000 resulting in a gain
on settlement of $2,523,813.
NPX Convertible Note
On April 25, 2014 (“NPX Closing Date”), the Company entered into a Securities Purchase
Agreement for an unsecured 12.5% convertible promissory note (the “Note”) with NPX Metals, Inc
(“NPX”), as the lender, in the amount of $220,000. The Note proceeds were used to fund the
Klondike Project and for general corporate purposes. The Company paid an arrangement fee of
10% of the Note and issued 220,000 warrants to purchase one full share at a price of $0.35
within three years from the NPX Closing Date. The Note principal and unpaid accrued interest
will be due and payable 24 months from the NPX Closing Date. The president of NPX is
Johnathan Lindsay, the son of the chairman of the board of the Company Alan Lindsay.  During
the term of the Note, NPX may elect by giving five days to convert their Note and any accrued but
unpaid interest thereon, into shares of the Company’s common shares at a conversion price
equal to $0.25 per common share. Additionally, for each common share purchased there will be
a three year warrant to purchase one hundred percent of the number of shares purchased at a
per share exercise price of $0.35.
On July 25, 2016, Bullfrog Gold Corp. (the “Company”) has settled all debts and obligations with
respect the Note. The principal and interest due NPX under the Note as of July 25, 2016 was
$278,438.   As settlement of the Note the Company issued NPX 18,562,500 shares of series B
preferred stock on August 1, 2016, resulting in a zero gain realized on settlement.
The ability of NPX to exercise the warrants is not contingent upon the conversion of the Note
and, accordingly, we determined that the warrant was “detachable” from the Note. The estimated
fair value of the warrant was calculated on the date of issuance using the Black-Scholes pricing
model, however we concluded the estimated fair value of the warrant was not material and does
not require separate accounting treatment. The warrant also contains a provision that the warrant
will be adjusted under certain conditions in the event future warrants are issued with more
favorable terms.
Related Party
As of June 30, 2016 Bullfrog has a related party payable with David Beling, President of
$274,002.  This amount consists of $194,494 of expense reports plus interest of $27,758 and
salary of $50,000 plus interest of $1,750.
NOTE 5 - COMMITMENTS
On June 11, 2012, the Company entered into an option agreement that was amended on May 6,
2015 with Arden Larson, an unrelated party, to purchase a 100% interest in the Klondike Project
(“Klondike”) that currently includes 109 unpatented mining claims. Klondike is located in the
Alpha Mining District about 40 miles north of Eureka, Nevada.
13
As stated in Note 2, on June 21, 2016, the Company sent a notice of termination to Arden Larson
with respect to the Option Agreement dated June 11, 2012 and amended May 6, 2015 for the
Klondike Project in Nevada.  The Company issued Larson 270,000 shares of common stock as
full and final payment, this resulted in a loss on abandonment of $164,850. The Company will
have no further obligations.
On March 23, 2015 (“Effective Date”), RMM entered into a Mineral Lease and Option to Purchase
Agreement (“Barrick Agreement”) with Barrick Bullfrog Inc. (“Barrick Bullfrog”) involving patented
mining claims, unpatented mining claims, and mill site claims (“Properties”) located three miles
west of Beatty, Nevada. These Properties are strategically located adjacent to the Company’s
Bullfrog Gold Project and include two patents that cover the SW half of the Montgomery-
Shoshone (M-S) open pit gold mine. In October 2014 the Company optioned the NE half of the
M-S pit and now controls the entire pit.
RMM shall expend as minimum work commitments for the benefit of the Properties prior to the 5th

Company Overview
We are an exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of properties
that may contain gold and other mineralization primarily in the United States.
Bullfrog Project
The “Bullfrog Project” lies approximately 3 miles northwest of the town of Beatty and 116 miles
northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada. Standard Gold initially acquired in 2011 a 100% right, title and
interest in  79 lode claims and 2 patented claims that contain approximately 1,600 acres subject
to a 3% net smelter royalty.
On October 29, 2014, Rocky Mountain Minerals Corp. (“RMM”) a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company, entered into an Option Agreement (“Option”) with Mojave. Mojave holds and
possesses the purchase rights to 100% of 12 patented mining claims located in Nye County,
Nevada. This property is contiguous to the Company’s Bullfrog Project and covers approximately
156 acres, including the northeast half of the Montgomery-Shoshone pit mined by Barrick Gold in
the 1990’s.
Mojave granted to RMM the sole and immediate working right and option with respect to the
Property until the 10th anniversary of the closing date, to earn a 100% interest in and to the
Property free and clear of all charges encumbrances and claims, save and except a sliding scale
NSR Royalty.
In order to maintain in force the working right and Option granted to it, and to exercise the Option,
RMM granted Mojave 750,000 shares of common stock and paid $16,000. RMM must pay to
Mojave a total of $190,000 over the next 10 years. For reference, Barrick Bullfrog (“Barrick”)
terminated a lease on these patents after they ceased operations in late 1999.
On March 23, 2015, RMM entered into a Mineral Lease and Option to Purchase Agreement with
Barrick involving 6 patented mining claims, 20 unpatented mining claims, and 8 mill site claims
located three miles west of Beatty, Nevada and covers approximately 444 acres. These
properties are strategically located adjacent to the Company’s Bullfrog Gold Project and include
two patents that cover the SW half of the Montgomery-Shoshone (M-S) open pit from which
Barrick produced approximately 220,000 ounces of gold by the late 1990’s. Underground mining
in the early 1900’s produced approximately 70,000 ounces of gold from the M-S deposit. Also
included in the agreement is the northern one third of the main Bullfrog deposit where Barrick
mined approximately 2.1 million additional ounces by open pit and underground methods. In
addition to prospective adjacent lands, these acquisitions provide the potential to expand the M-
S deposit along strike and at depth and in the northern part of the main Bullfrog deposit.
16
The Company also has access to Barrick’s substantial data base within a 1.5 mile radius of the
leased lands to further advance its exploration and development programs. To maintain the lease
and option, the Company must spend $1.5 million dollars within five years on the Barrick
properties and then pay Barrick 3.25 million shares of Bullfrog common stock while providing a
2% gross royalty on production from the Barrick properties. Overriding royalties of 5% net smelter
returns and 5% gross proceeds are respectively limited to three claims and two patents in the
main Bullfrog pit area. Barrick has retained a back-in right to reacquire a 51% interest in the
Barrick properties, subject to definition of a mineral resource on the Barrick properties meeting
certain criteria, and reimbursing the Company in an amount equal to two and one half times
Company expenditures on the Barrick properties.
Company management estimated in April 2015 that 41,000 ounces of gold in 1.44 million tons of
material averaging 0.97 gram per ton remains within a cutoff depth up to 75 meters under the
existing M-S pit. This manual estimate was based on cross sections typically spaced 15 meters
apart, a cutoff grade of 0.3 gram gold per ton at the top and bottom of mineral intervals, and drill
data and pit surveys completed by Barrick. Notwithstanding, Barrick makes no representation
concerning the accuracy or completeness of the data used by the Company or any estimates
made by the Company. Additional drilling is required to confirm some of the Company’s mineral
projections and to test for extensions at greater depths and along strike beyond the existing pit
limits.
Half of this M-S mineralization is on two Barrick patents within the pit and half is on two of the 12
Mojave patents. The direct ratio of waste to mineral tons within a cross-sectional preliminary pit
outline is 0.97:1, but this does not include waste removal required for ramps and other
considerations that would otherwise be included in a future pit plan based on computerized block
modelling and 3-D mine planning and design programs. It is cautioned that the Company’s
current and expanded properties contain no reserves or resources and that the estimates and
additional potential mineralization discussed herein may never become viable, feasible or
economic. These estimates were mainly prepared to assess the available M-S information and
plan additional drilling.
Significant drilling is required to test projections of mineralized trends and structures that extend
for considerable distances to the north and east of the M-S pit on the original lands acquired by
the Company in 2011. Located east of the M-S pit is an area 700 meters by 1,300 meters in
which there is only one shallow hole from which there is no data available. Only a small portion
of this area may be prospective, but the area certainly warrants additional study and exploration
drilling.
There is only one drill hole located about 150 meters NE of the M-S pit limit and another hole
1,000 meters NE of the pit along strike of a major geologic structure. In this regard, the
Company’s lands extend nearly 5,000 meters NNE of the pit and there has been very little drilling
in this area, even though several structures have been mapped by Barrick and others.
Barrick drilled twelve deep holes in the M-S area ranging from 318 meters to 549 meters. Notable
mineral intercepts from four holes below the central part of the pit are summarized below:

These results demonstrate that substantial amounts of gold occur in an exceptionally large
epithermal system that has good potential for expansion and possibly higher grades at depth.
Three of these intercepts are less than 75 meters below the existing pit. Two holes located 40
meters and 90 meters east of the 160 meter interval in hole #717 contained no significant
mineralization at this depth, whereas the 29 meters of mineral in hole #733 is 60 meters west and
the mineral zone is open to the north, south and west.
For reference, Barrick terminated all mining and milling operations in the autumn of 1999 when
their cash production costs exceeded gold prices that averaged less than $300 per ounce for the
year and reached a low of $258/oz in August 1999. The economic margins for heap leaching
lower grades at current gold prices near $1200/oz are deemed better than in 1999, and the
Company is positioned to explore such opportunities. Furthermore, Barrick never controlled or
had access to a patented claim on the immediate east and north limits of the M-S pit, but this
patent is owned by the Company.
During the past year the Company has studied Barrick’s entire electronic data base and much of
their paper data base obtained from their Elko, Nevada and Salt Lake City, Utah offices.On April
11, 2016 the Company distributed a press release that included a mineral inventory estimate of
470,000 ounces of gold, as summarized below.

Based on cross sectional estimation methods using a nominal gold cut-off grade of 0.3 g/t.
Average waste to mineral ratio was estimated at less than 5 to 1.
These estimates are supported by close-spaced drill holes upon which Barrick Bullfrog Inc.
(“Barrick”) produced 2.3 million ounces of gold from proven and probable ore reserves during
1989 to 1999. As a result, it would not require much more drilling or expense to upgrade these
inventories to much higher classifications and meet US and Canadian industry standards. For
reference, the large electronic data base acquired from Barrick includes 253,900 meters or 157
miles of drilling in 1,298 holes and a paper data base that may weigh 2,000 pounds. In this
regard, the Company is the only entity that examined the Project data base after it was re-located
to Barrick’s Elko and Salt Lake City offices in 2000 and performed detailed evaluations of
mineralization remaining around the M-S and Bullfrog mines. Notwithstanding, Barrick makes no
representation concerning the accuracy, completeness or application of their data by the
Company. It is further cautioned that the Project contains no reserves or resources and that the
mineral inventory estimates and other forward looking statements herein may never become
viable, feasible or economic.

samples with results as follows:

In 1995 Barrick performed a pilot heap leach test on 844 tons that were crushed to -½ inch and
averaged 0.019 gold opt. In only 41 days of leaching, 67% of the gold was recovered while
cyanide and lime consumptions were exceptionally low.
18
In 1986 St Joe column leached a 22-ton composite of minus 12-inch material grading 0.037 gold
opt to simulate heap leaching material at a coarse run-of-mine (“ROM”) size and recovered 49%
in 59 days of leaching, which they projected to 54% for leaching 90 days.
In summary, Project mineralization has good heap leach gold recoveries for crushing to 1.5 inch
or less and at ROM size. The latter is particularly important since much additional low grade
under 0.3 g/t that must be excavated from a pit could be ROM heap leached to supplement
production.

We are still in the exploration stage and have no revenues to date.

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 we had a net income compared to a net
loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015.  The 2016 net income was a result of the
final note payoff to RMB that came with a gain on extinguishment of debt of approximately
$2,500,000.  The terms of the payoff have been discussed throughout the body of this Form 10Q
and a complete disclosure can be found on the Form 8K filed July 7, 2016.  Additionally, David
Beling, President & CEO, agreed to a 50% salary reduction effective January 1, 2016 which
results in an annual salary of $100,000 and a reduction to general and administrative costs.
 Additionally, the Klondike Project agreement was terminated in June 2016 resulting in a loss on
asset abandonment of $164,850.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Losses from operations have been incurred since inception, with the exception of the three
months ended June 30, 2016, and there is an accumulated deficit of $7,580,041 as of June 30,
2016. Continuation as a going concern is dependent upon raising additional funds and attaining
profitable operations. On December 10, 2012, the Company entered into the Facility with RMB,
as the lender, in the amount of $4.2 million.
As previously discussed the RMB debt was paid off on June 30, 2016.
On March 31, 2015 we granted options to purchase 4,500,000 shares of our common stock of the
4,500,000 shares of common stock available under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan.
On March 23, 2015 (“Effective Date”), Rocky Mountain Minerals Corp. (“RMM”) the 100% owned
subsidiary of Bullfrog Gold Corp. (the “Company”) entered into a Mineral Lease and Option to
Purchase Agreement (“Agreement”) with Barrick Bullfrog involving patented mining claims,
unpatented mining claims, and mill site claims (“Properties”) located three miles west of Beatty,
Nevada. These Properties are strategically located adjacent to the Company’s Bullfrog Gold
Project and include two patents that cover the SW half of the Montgomery-Shoshone (M-S) open
pit gold mine. In October 2014 the Company optioned the NE half of the M-S pit and now controls
the entire pit.
RMM shall expend as minimum work commitments for the benefit of the Properties prior to the 5th
anniversary of the effective date per the schedule below:

On July 22, 2015, the Company sold an aggregate of 5,583,847 shares of common stock with
gross proceeds to the Company of $89,341 to a certain accredited investor pursuant to a
subscription. The proceeds from this offering will be used primarily for general corporate
purposes.
As previously stated, on the Company received $280,000 from certain accredited investors to pay
off the RMB debt on June 30, 2016.
Additional expenses will require funding for the entirety of the amount that we spend in 2016.
Financing transactions may include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit
facilities, or other financing mechanisms. The trading price of our common stock and a downturn
in the U.S. equity and debt markets could make it more difficult to obtain financing through the
issuance of equity or debt securities. Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible
that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect significant amounts owed to
us, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative
financing. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, stockholders may
experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or
privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock.
20
We have no revenues and do not expect to have revenues in 2016. The consolidated financial
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of
assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Should
we be unable to continue as a going concern, we may be unable to realize the carrying value of
our assets and to meet our obligations as they become due. To continue as a going concern, we
are dependent on continued fund raising. However, we have no commitment from any party to
provide additional capital and there is no assurance that such funding will be available when
needed, or if available, that its terms will be favorable or acceptable to us.
There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or on acceptable
terms. If additional financing is not available, we may have to substantially reduce or cease
operations.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not engage in any activities involving variable interest entities or off-balance sheet
arrangements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates
Stock based compensation is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and
is recognized as an expense over the employee’s requisite service period. We estimate the fair
value of each stock option as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The
Company estimates the volatility of its common stock at the date of grant based on the volatility of
comparable peer companies which are publicly traded. The Company determines the expected
life based on historical experience with similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual
terms, vesting schedules and post-vesting forfeitures. The Company uses the risk-free interest
rate on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury issues with an equivalent
remaining term approximately equal to the expected life of the award. The Company has never
paid any cash dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends
in the foreseeable future.
The Company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with FASB ASC 815,
Derivatives and Hedging, which requires additional disclosures about the Company’s objectives
and strategies for using derivative instruments, how the derivative instruments and related
hedged items are accounted for, and how the derivative instruments and related hedging items
affect the financial statements. The Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge
exposures to cash flow, market or foreign currency risk. Terms of convertible debt and equity
instruments are reviewed to determine whether or not they contain embedded derivative
instruments that are required under ASC 815 to be accounted for separately from the host
contract, and recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The fair value of derivative liabilities, if
any, is required to be revalued at each reporting date, with corresponding changes in fair value
recorded in current period operating results. Pursuant to ASC 815, an evaluation of specifically
identified conditions is made to determine whether the fair value of warrants issued is required to
be classified as equity or as a derivative liability.
Item 3. Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosures And Market Risk
As a smaller reporting company, as that term is defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are
not required to provide information required by this Item.
Item 4. Controls And Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of June 30, 2016 our
management concluded its evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures.
Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
21
In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required
to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures.
Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all
error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, the
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the
realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur
because of simple error or mistake. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon
certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any
design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
With respect to the quarterly period and six months ending June 30, 2016, under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of
the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-
15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon our
evaluation regarding the quarterly period and six months ending June 30, 2016, our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer, has concluded that its disclosure controls
and procedures were effective.
Changes in Internal Controls
There have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during
the three months ended June 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting.
