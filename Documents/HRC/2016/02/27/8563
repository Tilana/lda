<p><b>  Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on 
the activities of her office in the Plurinational State of Bolivia</b>*<b> </b>**<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> During 2010, noteworthy progress was registered in the Plurinational State of 
Bolivia with respect to legislative developments to implement the extensive range of 
human rights recognized in the Constitution, as well as important legal, political and 
institutional reforms aimed at eliminating discrimination and the historical exclusion of 
indigenous peoples, Afro-Bolivians and other vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p> Regarding indigenous peoples, important advances were observed in the field of 
political rights and representation, and with regard to the strengthening of the indigenous 
autonomous regions. The right to consultation played a substantial role in the drafting 
process of the bill on judicial boundaries, but was not instituted or was only partially 
applied with respect to other legislative and administrative measures that could affect 
indigenous peoples&#8217; interests. The situation of the Guaran&#237; people continues to raise 
concern. 
</p>
<p> In a social context still characterized by frequent manifestations of racism, 
discrimination and intolerance, especially against indigenous peoples, Afro-Bolivians and 
women, the Law against Racism and All Forms of Discrimination was promulgated, which 
represents an important and historic advance in the fight against racism and discrimination

<p>and responds to various international recommendations. This Law provides guidelines for a 
strong public policy on this matter. However, it also establishes some restrictions to 
freedom of expression and the press that should be defined in line with international 
standards. 
</p>
<p> Economic, social and cultural rights indicators, such as school attendance and 
extreme poverty, registered some improvements.  
</p>
<p> Despite legislative and other measures adopted to address historical problems in the 
administration of justice, the judicial system remained immersed in a structural crisis that 
precedes the current Government and is susceptible to political and economic pressures and 
insufficient access to justice. The transition to the establishment of the new higher courts, 
whose magistrates will be elected, for the first time in the history of the Plurinational State 
of Bolivia, by popular vote, did not take place within the schedule initially established by 
law. Trials for serious human rights violations have shown some progress, but a high level 
of impunity remained for both current and past cases. 
</p>
<p> Some cases of deaths, torture and other inhuman, cruel or degrading treatment were 
reported; in most of the cases responsibility was attributed to the police. In the present 
report, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights expresses concern for the 
violence against women, and analyses the phenomena of lynching, the rights of persons 
deprived of their liberty or those who have been victims of human rights violations by 
unconstitutional regimes, as well as the situation of human rights defenders and journalists. 
The report also provides details about the principal activities undertaken by the High 
Commissioner&#8217;s office in the country and includes 10 priority recommendations formulated 
by the High Commissioner.

<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. In February 2007, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) and the Government of the Plurinational State of Bolivia signed an 
agreement establishing a country office (OHCHR-Bolivia). The agreement, which was 
initially established for a three-year period, was approved by Congress through Law No. 
3713 of 13 July 2007. In May 2010 the presence of the country office in the Plurinational 
State of Bolivia was extended until the end of August 2013. 
</p>
<p>2. The mandate of OHCHR-Bolivia includes the provision of technical assistance to 
State institutions and civil society organizations; the promotion of human rights; and the 
monitoring of and reporting on the human rights situation in the country.   
</p>
<p><b> II. National context  
</b></p>
<p>3. On 22 January 2010, Evo Morales Ayma was sworn in for another term as President 
and appointed women to 50 per cent of ministerial positions. The inaugural Plurinational 
Legislative Assembly also opened with increased female representation. Moreover, six 
indigenous deputies won seats in special indigenous constituencies, along with an Afro-
Bolivian deputy for the first time in history. The Movement Towards Socialism-Political 
Instrument for the Sovereignty of the Peoples (MAS-IPSP) obtained two thirds of the seats, 
both in the Chamber of Deputies and in the Senate. 
</p>
<p>4. The Assembly approved over 80 laws during 2010, including the five fundamental 
laws to implement the Constitution as requested by the constitutional transitory clauses: 
Law No. 18 of 16 June on the Plurinational Electoral Organ; Law No. 26 of 30 June on the 
Electoral Regime; Law No. 25 of 24 June on the Judicial Organ; Law No. 27 of 6 July on 
the Plurinational Constitutional Tribunal; and Framework Law No. 31 of 19 July on 
Autonomous Regions and Decentralization. However, several actors expressed their 
concern that the tight deadlines for the passing of some laws did not always allow for an 
adequate period of discussion and reflection among all the concerned actors. 
</p>
<p>5. On 4 April, departmental and municipal elections were held; for the first time, these 
included the appointment of indigenous departmental assembly members in accordance 
with their own customs. The electoral campaign and the elections were held in a general 
climate of calm and respect for civil and political rights. Some isolated violent incidents, 
without major consequences, did occur in Beni, Chuquisaca, Pando, Santa Cruz and Tarija. 
</p>
<p>6. Various sectors, including some close to MAS-IPSP, staged local protests. In this 
context, in Caranavi, La Paz and in Potos&#237;, roadblocks were set up to demand the 
implementation of regional development projects. Likewise, the Confederation of 
Indigenous Peoples of Bolivia (CIDOB), the main organization representing indigenous 
people from the Eastern, El Chaco and Amazon regions of the Plurinational State of 
Bolivia, held a march to demand greater recognition of their rights. While in the cases of 
the blockade in Potos&#237; and the CIDOB march, negotiations took place to end those protests, 
in Caranavi, violent incidents broke out between the police and the demonstrators, causing 
two deaths and dozens wounded on both sides, and led to allegations of torture, use of 
excessive force, arbitrary detentions and unlawful entries into private houses, as reported by 
the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office. These incidents are currently under investigation. 
</p>
<p>7. On 30 April, the Plurinational Legislative Assembly elected the former president of 
the Permanent Assembly of Human Rights of Bolivia (APDHB), Rolando Villena Villegas, 
as Ombudsman for the 2010-2015 term. Within the scope of his mandate, the Ombudsman 
delivered important reports in which he found evidence of involvement of police agents and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/20/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>recommended investigations into the lynching of four policemen in Unc&#237;a, the violent 
incidents of Caranavi, and the death as a result of torture of David Olorio.  
</p>
<p>8. The administration of justice continued immersed in a long-standing structural crisis 
that precedes the current Government. In February, Law No. 3 on the Requirements for the 
Transition to the New Bodies of the Judicial Organ and the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office (the 
so-called &#8220;Ley Corta&#8221;, or &#8220;Short Law&#8221;) was passed, granting President Morales the power 
to appoint 15 magistrates on an exceptional and ad interim basis to the vacant positions in 
the Supreme Court of Justice and at the Plurinational Constitutional Tribunal, along with 
three members to the Judicial Council, until the election of permanent members. Those 
elections, the first in which senior judicial officials are to be directly elected by popular 
vote, were initially scheduled for December 2010 but later postponed due to delays in the 
establishment of regional electoral tribunals. The tenures of the persons temporarily 
appointed by the President under the &#8220;Short Law&#8221; were extended accordingly. The State 
School for Judges was created by law in June.  
</p>
<p>9. In April, the Government held the World People&#8217;s Conference on Climate Change 
and the Rights of Mother Earth in Cochabamba. The final declaration of this summit was 
submitted to the Secretary-General for inclusion in future negotiations on climate change. 
The Government also proposed a draft resolution for the recognition of the human right to 
drinking water and sanitation, which was adopted by the General Assembly on 28 July 
(resolution 64/292). 
</p>
<p>10. Following a highly participatory process, the Plurinational State of Bolivia 
concluded its first universal periodic review by the Human Rights Council with a 
Government commitment to comply with 78 of the 79 resulting recommendations.1 
</p>
<p>11. From 12 to 17 November, the High Commissioner undertook a visit to the 
Plurinational State of Bolivia. She met with President Morales, governmental, local and 
indigenous authorities, members of the Plurinational Legislative Assembly and members of 
the Judiciary, the Ombudsman, and representatives of indigenous, Afro-Bolivian, women&#8217;s 
rights, human rights, and media organizations, as well as with victims of human rights 
violations. In September, the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture visited the country 
and, in March, a special preparatory session of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues 
took place in La Paz. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Human rights situation  
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Racism, discrimination and intolerance  
</b></p>
<p>12. Racism, discrimination and intolerance in the Plurinational State of Bolivia are the 
result of historical domination and exclusion of indigenous peoples and Afro-Bolivians. 
The main victims of racial discrimination have been indigenous peoples and Afro-
Bolivians, especially women in those populations. 
</p>
<p>13. Currently, manifestations of racism, discrimination and intolerance persist. Even 
though debates on various legal and institutional reforms have contributed to overcoming 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The Plurinational State of Bolivia did not accept the recommendation by the United Kingdom of 
</p>
<p>Great Britain and Northern Ireland to support media initiatives on self-regulation, including the newly 
established Tribunal of Ethics for print journalists. The Government objected that &#8220;it cannot support a 
tribunal of ethics if it comprises only entrepreneurs and does not include all media employees&#8221; 
(A/HRC/14/7, para. 100).  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/20/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>the old patterns of stigmatization of the claims of indigenous and Afro-Bolivian leaders, 
often associated with &#8220;historical setbacks&#8221;, and a decrease in acts of violence has been 
observed in comparison with previous administrations, acts of intolerance towards 
indigenous and Afro-Bolivian cultural expressions still occurred. 
</p>
<p>14. On 8 October, Law No. 45 against Racism and All Forms of Discrimination was 
promulgated. This Law constitutes a historic breakthrough, since it establishes preventive 
and educational measures and responds to the repeated recommendations of the Committee 
on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination,2 the High Commissioner for Human Rights, 
and the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>15. The Law also defines public policy guidelines in this area and criminalizes certain 
racist and discriminatory acts. Article 16 provides for economic sanctions, including the 
suspension of operating licenses of media actors that publish &#8220;racist and discriminatory 
ideas&#8221;, and article 23 establishes prison sentences and precludes invoking immunity or 
special privileges for workers and owners of media outlets responsible for the 
dissemination of &#8220;ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, or that promote or justify 
racism and any other form of discrimination &#8230; or that incite to violence or to the 
persecution of persons or groups for racial or discriminatory motives&#8221;.3 
</p>
<p>16. Journalists&#8217; associations and media owners held several protests, demanding the 
suppression of article 16 and the amendment of article 23 of Law 45, and collected citizen&#8217;s 
signatures in support of their demands. Some foreign and international journalist 
associations also expressed concern about the effect of such provisions on freedom of 
expression. In this context, the Government called for a dialogue to regulate the application 
of the Law, including the media and their employees. However, only a few of the latter 
accepted the invitation, while others argued that such participation was meaningless in view 
of the presidential announcement that the law would not be modified. 
</p>
<p>17. Article 16 of the Law punishes the authorization and publication of &#8220;racist and 
discriminatory ideas&#8221;. However, international law requires that restrictions on freedom of 
expression be imposed only when justified as necessary to respect the rights or reputations 
of others or for the protection of national security or of public order, or of public health or 
morals.4 In this regard, any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes 
incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law.5 
</p>
<p>18. In order to establish a public policy regarding racism and discrimination, the Vice-
Ministry of Decolonization, along with departmental and regional actors, initiated a 
participatory process to carry out an assessment and to create a plan of action to fight 
racism and discrimination in the country. The National Human Rights Council embraced 
this initiative in the context of the implementation of the National Action Plan on Human 
Rights. 
</p>
<p>19. At the beginning of the assessment, the main Afro-Bolivian organizations described 
historical, serious and persistent patterns of racism and discrimination that this segment of 
the population has suffered in the fields of education and employment, where harassment, 
and physical and psychological violence are recurrent, especially against women. Also 
</p>
<p>  
 2 In 1975 the Committee requested that the Plurinational State of Bolivia adopt a law criminalizing all 
</p>
<p>forms of racial discrimination, as described in article 4 of the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (A/10018, para. 84). This recommendation was 
systematically reiterated in 1976, 1978, 1984, 1996 and 2003. 
</p>
<p> 3 Article 23 modifies article 281 quarter of the Penal Code. 
 4 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, art. 19, para. 3. 
 5 Ibid., art. 20, para. 2.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/20/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>noted were: discrimination in access to health services; difficulties in access to work, linked 
to limited access to higher education; and continuing police harassment, especially in urban 
areas. 
</p>
<p>20. These conditions were further aggravated by the long absence of affirmative action 
policies, the lack of statistical data as a basis for defining public policies, and widespread 
ignorance within society about the culture and history of the Afro-Bolivian people. In this 
context, however, the importance of the election of the first Afro-Bolivian parliamentary 
representative in the country&#8217;s history needs to be emphasized. The decision of the National 
Statistics Institute to include Afro-Bolivian issues in the 2011 census is also a positive step. 
</p>
<p><b> B.  Indigenous peoples&#8217; rights  
</b></p>
<p>21. During 2010, significant progress was made on the implementation of indigenous 
rights recognized in the Constitution, including political rights and the establishment of 
indigenous autonomous regions. 
</p>
<p>22. For the first time, seven representatives elected in special indigenous constituencies 
joined the Plurinational Legislative Assembly, in addition to other indigenous 
representatives elected by popular vote. The election of new authorities in 11 indigenous 
autonomies and the appointment of 18 indigenous departmental assembly members through 
a procedure that respects their traditions should also be highlighted. 
</p>
<p>23. However, some indigenous representatives criticized the complexity of the 
procedures to access indigenous autonomy, as well as the requirement of a minimum 
number of indigenous members for a community to be autonomous under the Framework 
Law on Autonomous Regions and Decentralization. Likewise, they denounced the 
insufficient consultation for the adoption of this Law. 
</p>
<p>24. As for the right to consultation, in accordance with the United Nations Declaration 
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Constitution, this right was generally respected 
in the drafting of the bill on jurisdictional boundaries. Nonetheless, the final text of this bill, 
which was adopted on 29 December, did not incorporate important issues that emerged 
from such consultations. Additionally, indigenous peoples reported that they had not been 
consulted on the adoption of other legislative and administrative measures that could affect 
their rights. Domestic legislation on consultation has so far been developed only with 
regard to hydrocarbon exploitation. In this sense, OHCHR-Bolivia registered various 
complaints about the lack of prior consultation, or the implementation of consultations 
through inadequate procedures, regarding development projects either under way or 
announced, particularly in relation to extractive activities.  
</p>
<p>25. Environmental pollution causing a risk of displacement in the territories of some 
indigenous peoples, as a result of the harmful effects of extractive industries in the Chaco 
region and in the Poop&#243; lake area, Oruro was also reported.  
</p>
<p>26. The situation of highly vulnerable indigenous peoples, in particular, the Ayoreo and 
Yuqui peoples, remains a concern mainly due to health problems, increasing pressures over 
their territories, human trafficking, and the lack of a continuing State response. In this 
regard, it is worth noting that the Ministry of Justice has initiated a drafting process for a 
bill to protect these peoples. 
</p>
<p><b>  Situation of the Guaran&#237; people 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, the Special Rapporteur on the situation 
of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people and the High 
Commissioner have repeatedly called for the eradication of forced labour and the territorial </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/20/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>reconstitution for the Guaran&#237; people. In this regard, the granting in December of about 
24,000 hectares of land to 19 communities in Alto Parapet&#237; should be highlighted. 
However, the Government should increase the efficiency and coverage of measures thus far 
implemented, including through the finalization of integrated development plans, and 
should confront resistance by landowners and departmental and municipal authorities in 
order to avoid the continuation of systematic violations of the rights of the Guaran&#237; people. 
</p>
<p>28. It is a matter of concern that the Office of the Public Prosecutor in Santa Cruz is 
pursuing criminal proceedings against some Guaran&#237; leaders for defamation, rooted in their 
complaints to various instances about their servitude. Likewise, the Office of the Public 
Prosecutor in Camiri, Santa Cruz, closed investigations, leaving in impunity the attacks 
suffered by members of the Guaran&#237; People&#8217;s Assembly, among others, in 2008. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Economic, social and cultural rights  
</b></p>
<p>29. The large catalogue of economic, social and cultural rights recognized in the current 
Constitution has led to the development of several public policies and legislative measures, 
a process begun in the previous administration. 
</p>
<p>30. Although no comprehensive data is yet available to assess the specific impact of the 
various social programmes that transfer resources to households and persons in vulnerable 
situations,6 their implementation, together with other factors such as the country&#8217;s 
economic growth, has helped improve some indicators, for instance the extreme poverty 
rate, which declined from 38 to 33 per cent.7 However, poverty rates, with a reduction from 
60 per cent down to 59 per cent between 2006 and 2009,8 continue to raise concern.  
</p>
<p>31. According to official data, the Zero Malnutrition Programme and the Juana Azurduy 
subsidy have contributed to reducing maternal mortality,9 the latter benefiting 250,000 
mothers and over 260,000 children under 2 years of age.10 
</p>
<p>32. In the field of education, after the launching of the Juancito Pinto subsidy, school 
dropout fell by more than 50 per cent11 and literacy and post-literacy programmes 
facilitated the inclusion of about 400,00012 people into primary education.  
</p>
<p>33. These initiatives still face structural challenges rooted in centuries of exclusion and 
discrimination, including striking inequalities in income distribution.13 Likewise, a 
significant, long-standing gap remains in the enjoyment of rights between the urban and 
</p>
<p>  
 6 Juancito Pinto and Juana Azurduy programmes; Universal Mother and Child Insurance (SUMI); 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Renta dignidad&#8221; subsidies; &#8220;Yo s&#237; puedo&#8221; national literacy programme; &#8220;Yo s&#237; puedo seguir&#8221;

<p>rural populations, negatively affecting indigenous peoples and Afro-Bolivians, in particular 
women and girls in rural areas. This situation is exacerbated by the difficulty of providing 
access to basic State services and social programmes in remote and scattered rural areas. 
</p>
<p>34. In February the Plurinational State of Bolivia signed the Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the ratification of which 
is still pending. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Administration of justice and the fight against impunity  
</b></p>
<p>35. Despite government efforts to reform and adopt legislation and other measures to 
resolve serious historical problems in the administration of justice, the weakness of the 
judicial system continued &#8211; access to justice and high impunity rates being the main 
problems. The system also remained exposed to political and economic pressures. The 
public defence system still faced difficulties, although the opening of eight new rural 
offices expanded its reach.14 
</p>
<p>36. In 2010, there were developments in some emblematic trials for grave human rights 
violations that occurred in previous years, such as the massacres in El Alto, La Paz in 
September and October 2003 and in El Porvenir, Pando in September 2008. 
</p>
<p>37. The laws on the Judicial Organ, on the Plurinational Constitutional Tribunal and the 
new Law on Prosecuting Senior State Officials15 were passed. The first two laws included 
intercultural and gender-equity criteria for the selection of candidates to the highest 
tribunals and to the Judiciary Council, for which the first election will take place in 2011. 
The new post of the Defender of Litigants&#8217; Rights was also established to monitor and 
ensure the development of any criminal and disciplinary proceedings against judges. While 
this could help prevent delays in justice and reduce the rampant corruption in the judicial 
system, the location of his new post within the executive branch may affect the 
independence of the judiciary. 
</p>
<p>38. In February, under the exceptional power granted by the &#8220;Short Law&#8221;, President 
Morales directly appointed 15 judges to the vacancies of the Plurinational Constitutional 
Tribunal and the Supreme Court, and three members to the Judiciary Council. The same 
law also extended the functions of the interim General Prosecutor. While noting the 
progress made in the resolution of many pending cases,16 the High Commissioner considers 
that, in order to ensure judicial independence, it is essential to accelerate the election 
process of judicial authorities. 
</p>
<p>39. On the other hand, the competence granted to the Judicial Council by Law No. 7 of 
18 May on Amendments to the Criminal Regulatory System to suspend judges from their 
duties based on an indictment, and not on a formal charge, as it was stipulated in the 
previous legislation of 1999, raises concerns regarding the security of tenure and the 
judicial career, and it may therefore affect judicial independence. 
</p>
<p>

<p>million. In 2009 the eight new offices increased staffing with nine public defenders and three assistant 
attorneys.  
</p>
<p> 15 Law No. 44 of 8 October 2010. 
 16 According to data released by the President of the Supreme Court in the national press on 6 October, 
</p>
<p>in nine months, the Plurinational Constitutional Tribunal resolved the 3,756 cases filed in the years 
preceding the entry in force of the new Constitution. Likewise, the Supreme Court resolved 2,078 of 
about 7,000 cases in its backlog. </p>

<p>40. Some decisions within the judicial system raised concern. Such is the case of the 
dismissal of 22 magistrates ordered by the Judicial Council on 3 May,17 based on their non-
participation in a call for evaluation to remain on duty, which had previously been declared 
invalid by the Plurinational Constitutional Tribunal.18 Another example included the 
indictments for prevarication and other crimes against three magistrates of the Superior 
Court of Justice of the Pando region, after having rendered decisions in the case of the 
massacre of El Porvenir. 
</p>
<p>41. In the area of the fight against corruption, the adoption of Law No. 4 of 31 March 
2010 on the Fight against Corruption, Illicit Enrichment and the Investigation of Fortunes 
(the &#8220;Marcelo Quiroga Santa Cruz&#8221; law) has provided a significant legal framework. The 
Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office initiated a number of legal proceedings involving governors, 
mayors and current and former senior government officials. The fact that most of these 
were against members of the opposition prompted allegations of partiality from opposition 
representatives. There were also cases involving members of the ruling party, 
corresponding to nearly 20 per cent, according to official figures.19 
</p>
<p>42. The accumulation of legal processes against some of the leading exponents of the 
political opposition, even in the legitimate will to fight corruption and impunity, requires 
strict observance of the presumption of innocence, due process and fair trial guarantees. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Case against former President Gonzalo S&#225;nchez de Lozada 
</b></p>
<p>43. At the time of writing, the trial for the violent repression of protests that occurred 
between September and October 2003 and that resulted in around 60 deaths and several 
hundreds injured, had almost been concluded with respect to the seven defendants who had 
not left the country. Initially former President S&#225;nchez de Lozada and 16 of his 
collaborators, ministers and members of the military high command, had been accused. 
</p>
<p>44. The development of the trial was confronted with numerous procedural and material 
obstacles. The public and private prosecutors presented around 400 people, including 
witnesses and expert witnesses, and introduced more than 1,500 pieces of evidence in what 
was the first trial in the country for serious human rights violations filed against a head of a 
constitutional Government. 
</p>
<p>45. Additionally, the proceedings filed with the United States of America, Spain and 
Peru for the extradition of the other indicted persons who had fled the country and had been 
declared in default, did not produce any results. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Case of the violent racist incidents of 24 May 2008 in Sucre 
</b></p>
<p>46. In April, the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office filed charges of sedition, public incitement 
to commit a crime, ill-treatment, and torture and other crimes against 18 people, including 
members of the Inter-Institutional Committee of Chuquisaca, university leaders and 
employees of public institutions. In September, three journalists were also charged with 
public incitement to commit a crime and endorsement of crime.20

<p>47. Among the indicted persons was the former rector of the public university, Jaime 
Barr&#243;n, who was elected mayor of Sucre in April, but resigned after having been suspended 
from office under the legislation in force since 1999. 
</p>
<p>48. On 16 November, a judge ordered the preventive detention of Mr. Barr&#243;n, which 
was commuted on appeal to alternative precautionary measures. Due to various procedural 
obstacles, the trial was set for late December; however, it was postponed due to the 
defendants&#8217; request for recusal of one of the judges. 
</p>
<p>49. Regarding victims, the lack of State programmes to address the consequences of 
abuses suffered by them and the obstacles in finding lawyers to take up their cases, 
continue to raise concern. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Case of the massacre in El Porvenir 
</b></p>
<p>50. On 19 June, almost two years after the massacre in El Porvenir, Penal Court No. 6 of 
La Paz began a trial against former prefect of Pando Leopoldo Fern&#225;ndez and 25 others, 
including several former public servants of the department of Pando, who were charged 
with terrorism, homicide, murder, injuries, and conspiracy.21 
</p>
<p>51. The Court decided to reject all the preliminary objections raised by the defendants, 
citing untimely submission or lack of legal basis. The request for cessation of preventive 
detention introduced by Mr. Fern&#225;ndez was also rejected, although the maximum legal 
period of imprisonment had expired.  
</p>
<p>52. After nearly six months, undue delays have been observed in this trial; the 
difficulties arising from the inherent complexity of the legal process were exacerbated by 
the parties&#8217; objections, which caused frequent deferrals. These circumstances affect the 
victims&#8217; and the defendants&#8217; right to seek prompt justice. 
</p>
<p>53. Threats and undue pressure against citizen-judges of the Court, a public prosecutor 
and a lawyer of the private prosecutors, as well as against some victims and witnesses, were 
also reported. Furthermore, OHCHR-Bolivia is concerned at the lack of State programmes 
on psychosocial assistance for the victims. 
</p>
<p><b> E.  Rights of victims of unconstitutional regimes  
</b></p>
<p>54. The rights to truth, justice and reparation for victims of human rights violations 
during the unconstitutional regimes continued to be seriously neglected. The 
implementation process for the reparation established in Law No. 2640 of 2004 has not yet 
been completed. The Technical Evaluation Committee (COMTECA) completed the first 
review of the 6,221 applications submitted, approving only 218. While the deadline was 
extended to enable the submission of petitions for reconsideration, only 40 per cent of those 
initially excluded availed themselves of this possibility. According to official sources, on 
31 December, the evaluation of 2,500 applications was finalized. The Ministry of Justice 
maintained a constructive dialogue with the main victims&#8217; organizations in order to modify 
the overly rigorous criteria applied during the first evaluation of victims&#8217; demands. 
Notwithstanding these initiatives, to date the fulfilment of the right of these victims to 
reparation is still pending.

<p>55. The search for the remains of guerrilla fighters killed by the army in 1970 in the 
town of Teoponte, La Paz continued, with the exhumations of five of them; the remains of 
four others, discovered late in 2009, were handed over to relatives. In October, the Inter-
Institutional Council for Clarifying Enforced Disappearances (CIEDIEF) completed the 
recruitment of a team of consultants to investigate and systematize information on cases 
occurred between 1964 and 1982. 
</p>
<p>56. Within the investigations of the enforced disappearance of Renato Ticona Estrada, 
Marcelo Quiroga Santa Cruz, Carlos Flores Bedregal and others, the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office made several efforts to access documents from the Armed Forces, which led to the 
issuance of court orders to that effect. However, as in the previous year, after the adoption 
of Ministerial Resolution 316 instructing the disclosure of military archives,22 the Armed 
Forces allowed for very limited access to the files, which did not contribute to the 
clarification of the truth about these cases. 
</p>
<p>57. In a ruling issued in August, the Supreme Court of Justice increased the sanctions 
against those responsible for the torture and enforced disappearances of Jos&#233; Trujillo Oroza 
and Jos&#233; Luis Ibsen. In a decision of September, the Inter-American Court of Human 
Rights found the State responsible for the enforced disappearance of Jos&#233; Luis and Rainer 
Ibsen, and ordered compensation for the victims&#8217; families. 
</p>
<p><b> F.  Right to life and integrity  
</b></p>
<p>58. During 2010, OHCHR-Bolivia registered a few cases of excessive use of force 
resulting in possible extrajudicial deaths, torture, and cruel, inhuman and degrading 
treatment alleged to have occurred either during law enforcement operations or while 
victims were in police custody. Official investigations have reportedly been opened into 
these cases. 
</p>
<p>59. In May, violent incidents between the police and peasants, students and inhabitants 
of the urban area of Caranavi resulted in the death of two demonstrators and over 40 people 
wounded on both sides after police broke up a roadblock that had prevented the freedom of 
circulation of both persons and goods for 11 days. There were indications that the police 
resorted to excessive use of force. The Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office set up a special 
commission to investigate the cases and, on 15 December, charges against 17 protesters 
were filed. 
</p>
<p>60. In July, David Olorio was allegedly tortured to death in a police station in El Alto, 
La Paz after being arrested for his alleged involvement in a robbery that resulted in the 
killing of a policeman. The investigating judge ordered the preventive detention of four 
police officers, including a colonel. However, in November, a person who allegedly 
participated in the same robbery was shot to death in the maximum security prison where 
he was being detained. 
</p>
<p>61. In October, Alfredo Vargas died, allegedly after being beaten by police officers in El 
Torno, Santa Cruz, who had forced him to stop the vehicle that he was allegedly driving 
under the influence of alcohol. OHCHR-Bolivia also registered allegations of torture, and 
cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of three women deprived of their liberty in 
penitentiary centres in La Paz. 
</p>
<p>62. The broadcasting of a video that showed acts of torture inflicted on a conscript by 
other Army members, which had occurred in 2009 in Oruro, exhibited the practice of 
</p>
<p>  
 22 See also A/HRC/13/26/Add.2, para. 50.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/20/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>violations of physical integrity within military premises. Other complaints about similar 
cases that occurred in Santa Cruz were also filed. 
</p>
<p>63. It should be positively noted that these allegations were followed by public 
condemnation by the President and senior government officials, and by the opening of 
criminal proceedings, which, in the cases of Mr. Olorio and Mr. Vargas, resulted in the 
identification and detention of those allegedly responsible.  
</p>
<p>64. The efforts of the Government and civil society to establish a national mechanism 
for the prevention of torture, in accordance with the commitment made by the Plurinational 
State of Bolivia in May 2006 after ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, should also be 
noted. In this regard, the Vice-Ministry of Justice and Fundamental Rights introduced a bill 
that was improved with contributions from other authorities and representatives of civil 
society. 
</p>
<p><b>  Lynching 
</b></p>
<p>65. According to press sources, while the number of lynching cases decreased in 
comparison with 2009, the number of deaths increased. During the first 10 months of the 
year, the press reported 45 cases of lynching or attempted lynching, resulting in at least 21 
people dead and 58 injured. Most of these cases occurred in marginalized peri-urban areas, 
where State presence is limited. Among the victims, mostly suspected of committing non-
serious crimes, three dead and nine wounded were women. Furthermore, OHCHR-Bolivia 
registered only four cases from past years that resulted in conviction. 
</p>
<p>66. The lynching of four policemen, reportedly perpetrated by several members of an 
indigenous community in the rural area of Unc&#237;a, Potos&#237; who, for 13 days, refused to return 
the bodies, should also be noted. As in other cases, the media attributed this lynching 
incident to indigenous justice, thereby seeking to discredit the latter. This case should be 
thoroughly investigated to determine whether State security forces exercised due diligence 
in the context of their responsibility to protect. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Right to personal liberty and the penitentiary system  
</b></p>
<p>67. The Government has made some efforts to reduce prison overcrowding by 
rehabilitating and expanding most penitentiaries. However in July 2010, the then general 
director of the penitentiary system reported that in January the prison population was 7,500 
inmates, and six months later, 8,700, against existing prison capacity of approximately 
4,700 people.  
</p>
<p>68. More than 70 per cent of the prison population is in preventive detention. This 
percentage may reveal a long-standing practice of using preventive detention as a rule and 
not as an exception, which, combined with the weaknesses of the administration of criminal 
justice, is likely to cause frequent violations of the right to personal liberty. 
</p>
<p>69. This trend, already seen in previous years, was aggravated in 2010 with the adoption 
of legislation that, on the one hand, increased the grounds for detention and its duration, 
and restricted the criteria required for its cessation,23 and on the other, prevented the 
possibility of applying alternative precautionary measures, as is available for crimes such as 
smuggling.24 
</p>
<p>  
 23 Law No. 7 of 18 May 2010.  
 24 Law No. 37 of 10 August 2010.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/20/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>70. Regarding detention conditions, the high level of prison overcrowding and the 
inhuman conditions suffered mainly by detainees held in police facilities and in rural 
prisons known as &#8220;<i>carceletas</i>&#8221;, are of special concern.  
</p>
<p>71. According to a recent study by the Ombudsman, the vast majority of &#8220;<i>carceletas</i>&#8221; 
have poor infrastructure and insufficient or often nonexistent medical facilities, which 
significantly impair inmates&#8217; rights to health, education and work. 
</p>
<p>72. OHCHR-Bolivia is also concerned about the presence of children of school age and 
adolescents living in prison with their parents deprived of liberty, or who in some cases 
may be themselves illegally detained with adults, being at risk of abuse and sexual 
exploitation. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Women&#8217;s rights  
</b></p>
<p>73. Since 2009, the National Plan on Equal Opportunities, entitled &#8220;Women Building 
the New Bolivia to Live Well&#8221; has been implemented as the main public policy to achieve 
and ensure equal opportunities for women and eliminate gender-based violence. 
</p>
<p>74. The Ministry of Justice, through its Vice-Ministry of Equal Opportunities, worked 
on the elaboration of public policies in defence and promotion of women&#8217;s rights, and on 
designing more effective legislative proposals to counter the various forms of violence 
against women; these are expected to have positive results in the near future. In this 
context, the Law on the Judicial Organ establishes specialized courts for cases of physical, 
psychological and sexual violence in both the private and public spheres, as well as the 
competence of agro-environmental tribunals to ensure women&#8217;s rights in the property 
registries. 
</p>
<p>75. However, the number of reported murders of women, almost doubling last year&#8217;s 
figures, raises serious concern. According to non-governmental sources, during the first six 
months of 2010, there were 69 murders of women nationwide, over half of them in the 
cities of La Paz and El Alto. 
</p>
<p>76. A similar trend was observed with respect to other forms of violence against women; 
available official figures illustrate that an average of 14 women per day received assistance 
in public health care centres25 for physical, psychological and sexual violence.26  
</p>
<p>77. The Government, along with the main human rights NGOs, initiated the process to 
draft a bill on sexual and reproductive rights, although it was later withdrawn. Another 
problem particularly affecting women and girls is human trafficking, which has motivated 
the drafting of a bill against human trafficking. The bill is currently under discussion in the 
Plurinational Legislative Assembly.   
</p>
<p>78. In the Government that was established in January, women hold 50 per cent of the 
ministerial positions. Additionally, the implementation of a gender quotas law helped 
increase to 42 per cent the proportion of women in municipal council posts. However, none 
of the governors, only 7 per cent of elected mayors, and 28 per cent of departmental 
assemblies&#8217; representatives were women. Additionally, sexist and denigrating attacks on 
the political role of women persisted in some campaigns.27

<p><b> I.  Human rights defenders   
</b></p>
<p>79. Some human rights defenders took part as observers in the interactive dialogue of 
the universal periodic review and disseminated throughout the country the 
recommendations addressed to the Plurinational State of Bolivia, as well as the voluntary 
commitments undertaken by the Plurinational State to improve the human rights situation. 
They also made significant contributions to the drafting of several bills. 
</p>
<p>80. During 2010, civil society and the Government maintained a fluid dialogue, and 
human rights organizations participated in the National Human Rights Council and other 
instances. However, some senior officials of the executive branch and the police publicly 
discredited and stigmatized on two occasions human rights defenders who had denounced 
human rights violations or criticized the way in which the Government had dealt with 
certain social protests. These were the cases of the statements made against the Permanent 
Assembly for Human Rights of La Paz and the Centre for Legal Studies and Social 
Research (CEJIS). 
</p>
<p><b> J.  Freedom of expression and freedom of the press 
</b></p>
<p>81. Unlike in the previous two years, where OHCHR-Bolivia had recorded significant 
numbers of both physical and verbal attacks against media and media workers, in 2010 the 
number and the seriousness of such allegations decreased.28 Nevertheless, concern remains 
regarding the impunity for cases that occurred in the previous two years. For instance, the 
killing of the journalist Carlos Quispe in 2008 is still to be clarified. 
</p>
<p>82. In her 2009 report, the High Commissioner recommended that the Plurinational 
Legislative Assembly eliminate the crime of contempt for being contrary to freedom of 
expression.29 However, during 2010 at least six new cases were initiated based on this 
crime. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Main office activities  
</b></p>
<p>83. In the context of strengthening indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, in March and November 
respectively, OHCHR-Bolivia organized two meetings with the main five indigenous 
organizations in order to coordinate joint actions and, at the same time, to conduct a shared 
assessment of the activities previously implemented. 
</p>
<p>84. OHCHR-Bolivia supported the Vice-Ministry of Justice for Indigenous Aboriginal 
and Farming Peoples in the consultation process for the bill on jurisdictional boundaries, at 
the stage of prior information as well as in the implementation of the process and in the 
incorporation of the observations made to the legislative proposal. In this context, it also 
organized several trainings on the rights of indigenous peoples and, in particular, on the 
right to consultation in accordance with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples. One of these trainings, resulting from an inter-agency initiative, was 
addressed to members of United Nations agencies.  
</p>
<p>85. OHCHR-Bolivia provided technical assistance to various round tables that resulted 
in the bill against racism and all forms of discrimination, and issued legal opinions on 
various versions of the proposed law. It also delivered a legal opinion recommending that

</p>
<p>article 16 of the bill be modified in accordance with international standards, so that 
limitations to freedom of expression be included in a clear and precise manner in the same 
law, and be applied by an independent body. These suggestions were not taken into account 
in the final version of the Law. Likewise, OHCHR-Bolivia has supported the Vice-Ministry 
of Decolonization in the elaboration of an assessment and a plan of action on racism and 
discrimination, through workshops to gather information, and a study on racism and 
discrimination in the field of education. 
</p>
<p>86. A joint work plan with the Guaran&#237; People&#8217;s Assembly was also established, which 
included a capacity-building workshop on human rights that was attended by over 100 
Assembly authorities, and two workshops on the participation and rights of indigenous 
women. At the preparatory session of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues held in 
the Plurinational State of Bolivia, OHCHR-Bolivia organized a meeting with several 
representatives of the Guaran&#237; people. In addition, follow-up was undertaken in cases of 
land distribution for redressing servitude and forced labour among communities of the 
Captaincy of Alto Parapet&#237; that were before either the National Institute of Agrarian Reform 
(INRA) or the National Agrarian Tribunal.  
</p>
<p>87. The Andean Programme for the Promotion of Afro-descendants concluded in April 
after holding a workshop, which notably led to the creation of the National Afro-Bolivian 
Council. 
</p>
<p>88. In terms of legislative technical assistance, comments on various bills, noting the 
need to adapt the new legislation to international human rights law, were provided to 
different authorities, members of the Plurinational Legislative Assembly, and the 
Specialized Legal Unit for Constitutional Development. At the same time, OHCHR-Bolivia 
promoted debates and participated in technical meetings, as in the case of the bills on the 
national mechanism for the prevention of torture and on jurisdictional boundaries.   
</p>
<p>89. In order to obtain detailed information from primary sources on the human rights 
situation, OHCHR-Bolivia conducted 28 missions for a total of 111 days to the nine 
departments of the country. It also observed the development of elections in April, and 
undertook the judicial monitoring of some emblematic trials through the attendance of its 
staff at hearings, the study of procedural documents, and interviews with justice officials, 
victims and defendants. 
</p>
<p>90. OHCHR-Bolivia, along with the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office and the Comunidad de 
Derechos Humanos network, held five trainings on national and international human rights 
protection mechanisms, addressed to human rights defenders in La Paz, Cochabamba, 
Pando, Santa Cruz and Tarija.  
</p>
<p>91. OHCHR-Bolivia also organized a workshop on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights and the Rights of Users and Consumers, in collaboration with the Ombudsman&#8217;s 
Office, the Vice-Ministry of Defence of the Rights of Users and Consumers and some 
NGOs. Around 75 persons, including State authorities and civil society representatives, 
participated in the event. Moreover, in coordination with the Ombudsman, OHCHR-Bolivia 
conducted two training sessions on the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities and its Optional Protocol aimed at persons with disabilities. The office 
published these documents and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Braille, and 
produced a DVD with the Convention and its Optional Protocol in audio and sign language.  
</p>
<p>92. OHCHR-Bolivia, in coordination with the coalition of civil society organizations, 
organized, through videoconference, the live broadcast from Geneva of segments of the 
seventh and fourteenth sessions of the Human Rights Council concerning the universal 
periodic review of the Plurinational State of Bolivia in 2010. In this context, and continuing 
the work begun in 2009, OHCHR-Bolivia disseminated to civil society the main </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/20/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>recommendations to the State and its voluntary commitments. The entire process was 
highly participatory.       
</p>
<p><b> V.  Follow-up on the implementation of recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>93. The recommendations previously formulated by the High Commissioner have been 
implemented to varying degrees. In some cases, the level of implementation is quite high, 
such as the development of complementary legislation to the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>94. State efforts to combat racism and discrimination, as well as social programmes in 
health care and education, should also be highlighted. Additionally, attacks against human 
rights defenders and journalists decreased, although investigations on attacks reported in 
2008 and 2009 did not make any progress, and impunity continued in those cases. 
</p>
<p>95. On the other hand, some efforts undertaken to implement other recommendations 
regarding various persisting problems, have not yet yielded results. These include, for 
example, the implementation of the right of indigenous peoples to consultation in some 
cases, the worrying situation of the Guaran&#237; people despite progress in distribution of land, 
and the obstacles faced by victims of unconstitutional regimes to enjoy their rights to truth, 
justice and reparation. 
</p>
<p>96. Considering the weaknesses that affect the justice administration system, some trials 
for serious human rights violations made some progress. The investigation into the alleged 
terrorist group reportedly active in Santa Cruz during 2009 has resulted in the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office filing charges for terrorism and armed insurrection against 39 people, 
including some alleged financial sponsors. However, in this case, as well as in others 
mentioned in previous reports, the investigations of allegations of excessive use of force by 
the police produced no results. 
</p>
<p>97. According to an assessment by the Vice-Ministry of Justice and Fundamental 
Rights, 36 per cent of the National Human Rights Action Plan was implemented during the 
first two years of its five-year cycle. Non-governmental sources questioned the validity of 
this implementation rate and criticized the methodology used for that calculation. The 
Ministry of Justice organized several meetings at the departmental level in order to foster 
the implementation of the Action Plan, which led to the establishment of ad-hoc 
committees in Chuquisaca, Cochabamba and Tarija. Nevertheless, in 2010 several 
governmental bodies did not allocate resources in their annual operating programmes for 
the Action Plan&#8217;s activities. According to the National Human Rights Council, entrusted 
with the implementation of the Action Plan, a wider dissemination of its content, along with 
greater coordination among the various ministries concerned should be ensured. The 
Ministry of Education led the creation of a commission to prepare a plurinational plan on 
human rights education, which initiated an assessment of the current situation in this matter.  
</p>
<p>98. Lastly, OHCHR-Bolivia did not observe any progress on the elimination of the 
crime of contempt for legally constituted authorities, nor the adoption of a plan to prevent 
and sanction lynching. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>During 2010, the human rights situation in the Plurinational State of Bolivia 
showed some progress, particularly with regard to the legislative development of the 
rights enshrined in the Constitution, and specifically the five fundamental laws. Other

<p><b>rights. Nonetheless, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is 
especially concerned about the persistent problems that affect the administration of 
justice. With respect to the situation analysed in the present report, the High 
Commissioner makes the following 10 priority recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>The High Commissioner reiterates her previous recommendations that have 
not yet been implemented, as well as the recommendations resulting from the 
universal periodic review and from other universal and regional human rights 
protection mechanisms. In this regard, she encourages the Government and civil 
society to set up an effective system to monitor the implementation of these 
recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>The High Commissioner urges the Plurinational Legislative Assembly to ensure 
that all laws adopted fully respect international human rights norms and principles, 
and to amend those provisions already adopted when found to affect such principles. 
The High Commissioner also calls upon the Government and the Plurinational 
Legislative Assembly to address existing perceptions and ensure transparency and 
adequate time for dialogue, consultation and analysis of all legislative proposals. </b> 
</p>
<p>102. <b>The High Commissioner encourages the State, the private sector, the media and 
civil society as a whole to carry out consistent and diversified programmes and actions 
to eliminate all forms of racism and discrimination, which should also include 
dialogue initiatives to overcome differences. She also encourages the international 
community to support those efforts. The High Commissioner</b> <b>calls on the 
Plurinational State of Bolivia to strike an appropriate balance between the right to 
freedom of expression and the prohibition of disseminating ideas based on racial 
superiority or hatred, incitement to racial discrimination or acts of violence.</b> 
</p>
<p>103. <b>The High Commissioner recommends that the Government and the 
Plurinational Legislative Assembly expand the existing legislation to ensure the right 
to consultation of indigenous peoples regarding the adoption of laws and 
administrative decisions that may affect their rights. </b> 
</p>
<p>104. <b>The High Commissioner urges the Ministries of the Interior and Defence to 
adopt measures to eradicate the excessive use of force, torture and cruel, inhuman and 
degrading treatment by security officials. She also recommends strengthening human 
rights protection mechanisms, and revising internal disciplinary procedures and the 
curricula of training courses in order to incorporate sound human rights provisions 
and control within the chain of command.</b> 
</p>
<p>105. <b>The High Commissioner encourages the competent authorities to increase their 
efforts to hold, as soon as possible, elections of the new judicial authorities. Within this 
framework, she recommends that the Plurinational Legislative Assembly guarantee a 
merit-based and transparent process for the selection of candidates. She also urges the 
election of the new Attorney General according to the same principles.</b> 
</p>
<p>106. <b>The High Commissioner reiterates her call to investigate, prosecute and 
sanction those responsible for human rights violations. In this respect, she 
recommends that the capacity of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office to investigate human 
rights violations by security officials be strengthened. As to ongoing trials initiated 
recently and in previous years, she invites the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and the 
judiciary to intensify their efforts to enforce law within a reasonable time and with 
full respect for victims&#8217; rights and due process guarantees of the defendants.</b> 
</p>
<p>107. <b>The High Commissioner calls upon the Government, the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office and the judiciary to ensure strict compliance with presumption of innocence, 
due process, and fair trial guarantees in all cases, including cases of corruption. </b></p>

</b></p>
<p>108. <b>The High Commissioner calls on the Government and the judiciary to 
implement effective and urgent measures to improve access to justice throughout the 
country. These should include measures to advance in the establishment and 
coordination of indigenous justice on an equal footing with ordinary justice, and to 
strengthen the capacities of justice operators in both systems by ensuring full respect 
of human rights. 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>Finally, the High Commissioner recommends that the State implement effective 
measures to prevent violence against women, and particularly to investigate, 
prosecute and sanction those responsible for such crimes.
