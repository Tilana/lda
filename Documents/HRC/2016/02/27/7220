<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 27/29, the Human Rights Council extended the mandate of the 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in the Sudan for a period of one year, 
</p>
<p>and requested him to continue his engagement with the Government of the Sudan to assess, 
</p>
<p>verify and report on the situation of human rights with a view to making recommendations 
</p>
<p>on technical assistance and capacity-building for addressing human rights in the country; 
</p>
<p>and to report to the Council at its thirtieth session.  
</p>
<p>2. The present report covers the period from 1 December 2014 to 30 June 2015. In 
</p>
<p>compliance with the Code of Conduct of Special Procedures Mandate Holders of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council, a draft report was shared with the Government of the Sudan in 
</p>
<p>order to provide it with an opportunity to comment on the observations and findings of the 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert.  
</p>
<p>3. The present report is based on information made available to the Independent Expert 
</p>
<p>during his visit to the Sudan, as well as on information provided by the Government of the 
</p>
<p>Sudan, the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) and 
</p>
<p>other sources, including civil society organizations, United Nations agencies, funds and 
</p>
<p>programmes with operational competence in the Sudan, as well as the donor community.  
</p>
<p>4. The Independent Expert expresses his gratitude to the Government of the Sudan for 
</p>
<p>its invitation and cooperation, to the Office of the United Nations Resident and 
</p>
<p>Humanitarian Coordinator in Khartoum, and to UNAMID for supporting and facilitating 
</p>
<p>his mission to the country. He also thanks the donor community and civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations for their important work in promoting and protecting human rights in the 
</p>
<p>country.  
</p>
<p>5. The Independent Expert also wishes to thank the previous mandate holder, Prof. 
</p>
<p>Mashood Baderin, for the invaluable exchanges held on the complexity of the human rights 
</p>
<p>situation and the development of the mandate. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Methodology  
</b></p>
<p>6. The Independent Expert undertook one visit to the Sudan during the period under 
</p>
<p>review, from 13 to 23 May 2015, and visited Khartoum as well as the States of Northern 
</p>
<p>and Southern Darfur. The objective of the field visits and meetings in this early part of his 
</p>
<p>work on the Sudan was to identify the technical assistance and capacity-building needs of 
</p>
<p>the Sudan that will enable the State to fulfil its human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>7. In Khartoum, the Independent Expert held wide-ranging discussions with senior 
</p>
<p>government officials, including the Minister for Justice, the Assistant to the President of the 
</p>
<p>Republic of the Sudan and the Director General of Global Issues of the Ministry of Foreign 
</p>
<p>Affairs. He was apprised of the situation of human rights in the country by the Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>ad interim and members of the Advisory Council for Human Rights, and was encouraged 
</p>
<p>by their response to some of the issues he raised. He also met the Chairperson and members 
</p>
<p>of the National Commission for Human Rights. He had frank and fruitful discussions with 
</p>
<p>the Deputy Director of the National Security Service, and interacted with the Chief Justice 
</p>
<p>and ranking members of the Judiciary, the Chairperson and members of the National 
</p>
<p>Commission for Human Rights, the Chairperson and members of the National Elections 
</p>
<p>Commission, the Director of the Humanitarian Aid Commission, the Chairperson and 
</p>
<p>members of the Sudanese Bar Association, the Chairperson and members of the National 
</p>
<p>Press Council, the National Council for Child Welfare, the National Mechanism for Family 
</p>
<p>and Child Protection Unit and the National Demining Centre. The Independent Expert also </p>


<p>attended a forum on the impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human 
</p>
<p>rights. He also met with representatives of civil society organizations, human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders and victims of human rights violations, some of whom shared their personal 
</p>
<p>experiences with him. He met with members of the diplomatic community, representatives 
</p>
<p>of opposition political parties and staff members and students of the University of 
</p>
<p>Khartoum, from whom he received valuable information on the human rights situation in 
</p>
<p>the country.  
</p>
<p>8. In Northern Darfur, the Independent Expert met with a representative of the Darfur 
</p>
<p>Regional Authority, the Governor of the State of Northern Darfur, the Special Prosecutor 
</p>
<p>for Crimes in Darfur and officials of UNAMID and United Nations agencies in Northern 
</p>
<p>Darfur. In Southern Darfur, he held a meeting with the Governor of Southern Darfur State 
</p>
<p>and his team, as well as with officials of UNAMID. He also visited three camps for 
</p>
<p>internally displaced persons, namely, the Abou Shouk camp in Northern Darfur and the 
</p>
<p>Otash and Dereige camps in Southern Darfur, where he witnessed the deplorable living 
</p>
<p>conditions of the residents.  
</p>
<p>9. During his visit, the Independent Expert reiterated the scope of his mandate to the 
</p>
<p>Government and all relevant stakeholders. As explained by the previous mandate holder 
</p>
<p>(see A/HRC/21/62), the Government of the Sudan continues to hold the position that since 
</p>
<p>the mandate of the Independent Expert is no longer under the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>agenda item 4 (&#8220;Human rights situation that requires the Council&#8217;s attention&#8221;) but rather 
</p>
<p>under item 10 (&#8220;Technical assistance and capacity-building&#8221;), no reporting or monitoring 
</p>
<p>on any element of human rights was required. For their part, other national and 
</p>
<p>international stakeholders expressed the view that the mandate includes assessment of and 
</p>
<p>reporting on the situation of human rights in the Sudan, essential to the formulation of 
</p>
<p>realistic and workable technical advice for a gradual and effective improvement in that 
</p>
<p>situation. 
</p>
<p>10. The Independent Expert confirms his understanding that the mandate does indeed 
</p>
<p>come under agenda item 10, and that it includes the responsibility to assess and report on 
</p>
<p>the situation of human rights in view of making sound recommendations on technical 
</p>
<p>assistance and capacity-building. This was underscored by the Human Rights Council in its 
</p>
<p>resolution 27/29, in which the Council renewed the mandate of the Independent Expert to 
</p>
<p>continue &#8220;to assess, verify and report on the situation of human rights with the view to 
</p>
<p>make recommendations on technical assistance and capacity-building for addressing human 
</p>
<p>rights in the country.&#8221; This mandate enables the Government of the Sudan to take 
</p>
<p>ownership in supporting the implementation of the recommendations. It also enables the 
</p>
<p>donor community to provide additional targeted financial support and the technical 
</p>
<p>expertise needed to address the human rights challenges in the country.  
</p>
<p>11. The Independent Expert notes with satisfaction that the Government has endorsed 
</p>
<p>his understanding and analysis of the scope of the mandate, which enabled his engagement 
</p>
<p>with a wide range of stakeholders, including the donor community, leaders of the political 
</p>
<p>opposition and others civil society actors. He also points out that the Government showed 
</p>
<p>its willingness to continue to cooperate with the Human Rights Council in order to fulfil its 
</p>
<p>human rights obligations. In all his meetings with the Government, the Independent Expert 
</p>
<p>received assurances of cooperation with the mechanism he represents. Nonetheless, he 
</p>
<p>remains concerned by assessment given by Sudan officials of the human rights situation in 
</p>
<p>the country that appears not to take into account the deteriorating environment.  </p>


<p><b> III. Recent developments 
</b></p>
<p>12. On 4 January 2015, Parliament approved amendments to the 2005 national interim 
</p>
<p>Constitution, including additional powers for the President to appoint and remove senior 
</p>
<p>officials, including State governors, as well as those holding other senior constitutional, 
</p>
<p>judicial, military, police and security posts. The amendment to article 151 transformed the 
</p>
<p>National Security Service from an intelligence agency focused on information gathering, 
</p>
<p>analysis and advice to a full-fledged security agency with a broad mandate to exercise a 
</p>
<p>number of functions usually carried out by the armed forces or other law enforcement 
</p>
<p>agencies.  
</p>
<p>13. The Independent Expert notes that the increased mandate and powers of the National 
</p>
<p>Security Service is already having a far-reaching, negative impact on the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights. Under the National Security Act, National Security Service 
</p>
<p>agents have immunity from civil and criminal liability for acts conducted in &#8220;the course of 
</p>
<p>their duty&#8221; or in &#8220;good faith&#8221;. They are only subject to prosecution if the Director General 
</p>
<p>of the National Security Service decides to lift this &#8220;immunity&#8221; or &#8220;prerogative&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>14. With the recent development, there is a risk that the mandate of the National 
</p>
<p>Security Service, cutting across intelligence, military and law enforcement spheres, could 
</p>
<p>also undermine or unduly interfere with ordinary police work, thus creating confusion and 
</p>
<p>causing further dysfunction in the criminal justice system. 
</p>
<p>15. On 22 February 2015, the President of the Sudan assented to a bill amending article 
</p>
<p>149 of the Sudanese Criminal Code. The amendment made a substantive and legal 
</p>
<p>distinction between rape and adultery. The Independent Expert commends the Sudanese 
</p>
<p>authorities for this legal reform, which constitutes a concrete step in the fight against 
</p>
<p>impunity for violence against women in the Sudan. He expects that more cases of sexual 
</p>
<p>violence, particularly rape, will be reported to authorities, and that rape victims will be 
</p>
<p>encouraged to pursue legal redress given that they will no longer be accused of adultery.1  
</p>
<p>16. General elections were held at all levels of government (national, state and local) 
</p>
<p>from 13 to 15 April, despite repeated calls from opposition forces and civil society groups 
</p>
<p>for a postponement of the elections. The elections were extended by a day by the National 
</p>
<p>Elections Commission, until 16 April. Three major opposition parties, including the Umma 
</p>
<p>National Party, the Popular Congress Party and the Sudanese Communist Party, under the 
</p>
<p>umbrella of the National Consensus Forces, as well as some civil society organizations 
</p>
<p>boycotted the elections, claiming that the political and security environment was not 
</p>
<p>conducive to the holding of free and fair elections. The elections were monitored by 
</p>
<p>observers from the African Union, who reported a low turnout of voters throughout the 
</p>
<p>country. In the final results released by the National Elections Commission, President Omar 
</p>
<p>Al Bashir was declared winner in the national presidential ballot, winning 94 per cent of 
</p>
<p>votes.  
</p>
<p>17. In the lead-up to and during the elections, human rights organizations and UNAMID 
</p>
<p>recorded a number of human rights violations. On 6 and 7 December 2014, Dr. Amin 
</p>
<p>Mekki Medani, a human rights activist, Farouk Abu Issa, the leader of the National 
</p>
<p>Consensus Forces, and Farah Alagar, another political activist, were arrested by the 
</p>
<p>National Security Service for having signed and supported the &#8220;Sudan Call&#8221;, a political 
</p>
<p>declaration calling for the restoration of democracy in the Sudan that had been signed by 
</p>
<p>Sudanese opposition parties, rebel movements and civil society. Dr. Medani and Mr. Abu 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 Prior to the amendment, legal provisions in the article allowed for prosecution of rape victims for 
</p>
<p>adultery if rape was not proven.  </p>


<p>Issa were detained incommunicado for 2 weeks and later charged in a terrorism court with 
</p>
<p>having undermined the constitutional order and for waging war against the State, two 
</p>
<p>crimes for which the death penalty may be applicable and bail was therefore not 
</p>
<p>guaranteed. On 9 April 2015, their trial was suspended and they were released, together 
</p>
<p>with Mr. Alagar. 
</p>
<p>18. On 12 April 2015, concerns were raised about the situation of Sandra Kodouda, a 
</p>
<p>Sudanese activist, who was abducted by unidentified persons while on her way to a meeting 
</p>
<p>at the headquarters of the National Umma Party to discuss the election boycott. The 
</p>
<p>National Security Service denied that she had been detained before her release on 15 April. 
</p>
<p>She subsequently issued a written apology, reportedly under duress, in which she denied 
</p>
<p>any involvement of the National Security Service &#8211; after it filed defamation charges against 
</p>
<p>her &#8211; in her temporary disappearance.  
</p>
<p>19. In Darfur, the authorities continued to impose restrictions on the rights to freedom of 
</p>
<p>expression, association and peaceful assembly. In El Fasher, Northern Darfur, 
</p>
<p>demonstrations organized by students at El Fasher University on 14 and 15 April 2015 were 
</p>
<p>repressed by Sudanese police, who arrested and detained 20 students. The students were 
</p>
<p>charged with offences relating to &#8220;assault on the constitutional order&#8221;, one of which carried 
</p>
<p>a maximum penalty of death. The latter was subsequently removed from the charge sheet 
</p>
<p>and the students were granted bail on 22 April.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Main human rights challenges 
</b></p>
<p>20. In spite of some progress made in legislative reforms, the Sudan continues to face 
</p>
<p>enormous human rights challenges in terms of securing basic fundamental rights, in 
</p>
<p>particular the rights to freedom of expression and opinion, freedom of the press, freedom of 
</p>
<p>association and peaceful assembly, and freedom of religion. In addition, the recent military 
</p>
<p>operations of the Government in the conflict-affected areas of Darfur, the States of 
</p>
<p>Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile, as well as inter-tribal clashes, continue to result in 
</p>
<p>serious human rights violations and the large-scale displacement of civilians in these 
</p>
<p>regions. Impunity for human rights violations and abuses, and serious violations of 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law, remains a recurring problem. The enjoyment of economic, 
</p>
<p>social and cultural rights also needs to be improved to address the severe poverty affecting 
</p>
<p>particularly women and children.  
</p>
<p>21. The Independent Expert discussed these challenges in his meetings with government 
</p>
<p>representatives and appreciates the Government&#8217;s commitment to address them as part of 
</p>
<p>its efforts towards improving the situation of human rights in the country. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Press censorship 
</b></p>
<p>22. There is a need to ensure the protection of freedom of the press in the Sudan; the 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert notes in particular the application of national security laws to clamp 
</p>
<p>down on the press, including through the closure of media houses, the arrest of journalists 
</p>
<p>and the confiscation of newspapers and equipment by the National Security Service. 
</p>
<p>23. Since December 2014, there have been several clampdowns on press and media 
</p>
<p>freedoms, including the censorship and temporary closure of several newspapers. During 
</p>
<p>the period under review, at least 16 newspapers had their publications confiscated on 42 
</p>
<p>different occasions by the National Security Service. Several journalists reported 
</p>
<p>interrogation and harassment by the police and of security service agents. On 16 February 
</p>
<p>2015, the print runs of 14 newspapers were confiscated. On 25 May, the editions of 10 
</p>
<p>newspapers were seized by security service officers. These actions contravene article 39 of </p>


<p>the interim national Constitution of the Sudan (2005), which guarantees &#8220;freedom of 
</p>
<p>expression and the media&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>24. The Independent Expert had raised this issue in his discussions with government 
</p>
<p>officials as a legitimate concern to which the Government needed to pay attention, in view 
</p>
<p>of the importance of freedom of expression and of the press in the promotion and protection 
</p>
<p>of human rights in a democratic society.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Curtailment of activities of civil society organizations 
</b></p>
<p>25. During the period under review, the Government continued to clamp down on the 
</p>
<p>activities of civil society organizations.  
</p>
<p>26. Four leading civil society organizations have been shut down, while at least five 
</p>
<p>others are under threat of imminent closure. On 18 January 2015, the National Security 
</p>
<p>Service raided the Mohmoud Mohamed Taha Cultural Centre. Later that month, the 
</p>
<p>National Civic Forum and the Sudanese Writers Union were informed by letter that their 
</p>
<p>licences would be revoked by the Ministry of Culture. On 26 March, security agents raided 
</p>
<p>the Terakes Training and Human Development Centre in Khartoum while Adil Bakheit, a 
</p>
<p>member of the Sudanese Human Rights Monitor, was conducting a human rights workshop. 
</p>
<p>During the raid, Mr. Bakheit&#8217;s computer and documents were confiscated. Three staff 
</p>
<p>members of the Centre were interrogated in connection with the raid.  
</p>
<p>27. On 16 April 2015, Mr. Bakheit was arrested by the National Security Service while 
</p>
<p>he was attending a workshop at the Tracks Training Centre in Khartoum. He was 
</p>
<p>subsequently charged with criminal conspiracy, inciting opposition against public authority 
</p>
<p>through the use of violence or criminal force, the publication of false news, offences against 
</p>
<p>the State and impersonating a public servant. He was released on bail on 3 May.  
</p>
<p>28. The above-mentioned actions appear to be in contravention with the rights to 
</p>
<p>freedom of peaceful association as set forth in the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights and the principles of the Declaration on the Rights and Responsibility of 
</p>
<p>Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized 
</p>
<p>Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. They also contravene article 40 of the interim 
</p>
<p>national Constitution of the Sudan, which guarantees the freedom of assembly and 
</p>
<p>association. 
</p>
<p>29. The Independent Expert notes the important role played by human rights defenders 
</p>
<p>in democratic societies, and stresses the need for the Government of the Sudan to allow 
</p>
<p>them to carry out their activities in an open, safe and secure environment. 
</p>
<p><b> C.  Freedom of religion 
</b></p>
<p>30. The right to freedom of religion is enshrined in article 18 of the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and in article 38 of the interim national Constitution 
</p>
<p>of the Sudan. The interim national Constitution also established the Commission for the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Non-Muslims in Khartoum State to ensure that their rights are protected in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the Constitution. The Independent Expert, however, received information 
</p>
<p>in relation to incidents of arrest and restrictions of freedom of religion or belief of the 
</p>
<p>Christian communities. On 14 December 2014, Reverend Yat Michael Ruot Puk, a pastor 
</p>
<p>from the Southern Sudan Evangelical Church, was arrested by National Security Service 
</p>
<p>officers. On 11 January 2015, Reverend Peter Yein Reith was arrested at his residence. 
</p>
<p>Both clergymen were arrested without any arrest warrant and were held incommunicado 
</p>
<p>until 1 March 2015. On 4 May, they were brought before a court, where they were both </p>


<p>charged with undermining the constitutional system, waging war against the State, 
</p>
<p>espionage, unlawful disclosure and receipt of official information or documents, arousing 
</p>
<p>feelings of discontent among regular forces, breach of public peace and offences relating to 
</p>
<p>insulting religious beliefs. Following these charges and subsequent hearings on 19 and 31 
</p>
<p>May, both pastors were allegedly moved to a high security prison in North Khartoum. They 
</p>
<p>were last seen by their families and pastors from their church on 3 June. 
</p>
<p>31. The Independent Expert is concerned about the arrest, detention and possible trial of 
</p>
<p>the two people, which would be in contravention of articles 18, 19 and 20 of the Universal 
</p>
<p>Declaration of Human Rights and articles 18, 19, 21, 26 and 27 of the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that stress the rights to freedom of religion, freedom 
</p>
<p>of opinion and expression, freedom of peaceful assembly and of minorities. He calls upon 
</p>
<p>the Government of Sudan to respect the fundamental freedoms enshrined in the interim 
</p>
<p>national Constitution and to allow the Sudanese people to exercise their rights freely.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Human rights violations committed during the demonstrations of 
</b></p>
<p><b>September 2013  
</b></p>
<p>32. The Independent Expert also met with representatives of some of the family 
</p>
<p>members of deceased victims of the oil-subsidy demonstrations held in September 2013 
</p>
<p>across Khartoum State, which resulted in fatal shootings, injuries and the destruction of 
</p>
<p>property, as well as the arrest and detention of many demonstrators. The &#8220;brief report on the 
</p>
<p>acts of violence of September 2013&#8221;, prepared and issued by the Office of the Chief 
</p>
<p>Prosecutor of Khartoum State, was discussed at length by the previous mandate holder in 
</p>
<p>his last report (A/HRC/27/69). The family members and their lawyers affirmed that they 
</p>
<p>had all lost hope in their quest for justice for their deceased relatives, and felt threatened. 
</p>
<p>33. The Independent Expert calls upon the Government to ensure that an independent 
</p>
<p>judicial inquiry is conducted into the killings and various other human rights violations, to 
</p>
<p>address arbitrary violations of the fundamental right to life, and impunity.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Conflict-affected areas 
</b></p>
<p>34. Armed conflicts and lack of security continue to be major sources of human rights 
</p>
<p>violations in different parts of the Sudan. In particular, Darfur and the States of Southern 
</p>
<p>Kordofan and Blue Nile continue to experience sporadic cycles of armed conflicts, violent 
</p>
<p>attacks and banditry, which have had a negative impact on civilians during the reporting 
</p>
<p>period.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Darfur 
</b></p>
<p>35. As the conflict in Darfur, which broke out in February 2003, enters its twelfth year, 
</p>
<p>the situation of human rights continues to be a major concern. While the signing of the 
</p>
<p>Doha Document for Peace in Darfur by the Government and the Liberation and Justice 
</p>
<p>Movement was a sign of political progress, the persistence of fighting between the 
</p>
<p>Sudanese Armed Forces and non-signatory armed opposition groups has been compounded 
</p>
<p>by clashes between various tribes (the latest reported being between the Rezeigat and the 
</p>
<p>Maalia in East Darfur) that highlight the vulnerability of civilians in the region. 
</p>
<p>Indiscriminate attacks against civilians, tribal clashes and heightened criminality continued 
</p>
<p>unabated, at the most met by a feeble response from law enforcement officials and security 
</p>
<p>institutions, leading to the loss of lives, civilian injuries and the destruction of civilian 
</p>
<p>property. </p>


<p>36. According to UNAMID, patterns and incidents of violations of human rights and 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law deteriorated following the deployment to Darfur of the 
</p>
<p>Rapid Support Forces in 2014, which was part of Operation Decisive Summer During the 
</p>
<p>campaign, UNAMID documented cases in which the Rapid Support Forces launched 
</p>
<p>attacks, including on civilians suspected of being sympathetic to armed opposition 
</p>
<p>movements in both Northern and Southern Darfur States. The attacks involved multiple 
</p>
<p>human rights violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law, including 
</p>
<p>the indiscriminate killing of civilians, the destruction of civilian property and objects, and 
</p>
<p>considerable displacement of civilians. UNAMID also obtained accounts from victims and 
</p>
<p>witnesses that pointed to a pattern in the burning of villages, the looting of civilian 
</p>
<p>property, including livestock, and the destruction of sources of livelihood necessary for 
</p>
<p>civilian survival.  
</p>
<p>37. Although large-scale fighting between the Government and armed groups have 
</p>
<p>subsided,2 sporadic clashes, acts of banditry, intercommunal violence and restrictions to 
</p>
<p>freedom of movement and political liberties persist throughout Darfur and continue to pose 
</p>
<p>challenges to a participatory and comprehensive political dialogue. In particular, tribal 
</p>
<p>clashes stemming from resource-related disputes, including land, are becoming a major 
</p>
<p>source of insecurity as they increasingly involve well-armed individuals who have pledged 
</p>
<p>their allegiance, sometimes on tribal lines, to either armed groups or the Government of the 
</p>
<p>Sudan and its forces, namely, the Rapid Support Forces, the Border Guards and the Central 
</p>
<p>Reserve Police. 
</p>
<p>38. The lack of substantive progress in achieving a durable peace coupled with the 
</p>
<p>emergence and shifting loyalties of armed groups have continued to fuel the conflict, during 
</p>
<p>which serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law are perpetrated 
</p>
<p>by all parties to the conflict. 
</p>
<p><b> (a) Situation of internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p>39. According to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the conflict in 
</p>
<p>Darfur has led to the internal displacement of some 2.5 million people, most of whom 
</p>
<p>depend on support for basic services and on aid from humanitarian agencies. The 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert visited the Abou Shouk, Otash and Dereige camps for displaced 
</p>
<p>persons in Northern and Southern Darfur States. He is concerned not only at the ongoing 
</p>
<p>displacement of residents and the attendant humanitarian crisis, but also for the future of 
</p>
<p>displaced persons in general.  
</p>
<p>40. In Nyala, the representatives of internally displaced persons informed the 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert that the newly displaced were not receiving any aid, in particular food 
</p>
<p>or medical assistance, owing to the limited stocks of humanitarian aid. The Independent 
</p>
<p>Expert therefore calls upon the Government of the Sudan and the international community 
</p>
<p>to provide humanitarian assistance to displaced persons, who live in very precarious 
</p>
<p>conditions, and thereby help to realize their economic, social and cultural rights. These 
</p>
<p>people live in a state of insecurity owing to the presence of various armed elements and to 
</p>
<p>crimes that are commonplace in the region. The Independent expert also calls upon the 
</p>
<p>Government and UNAMID to fulfil their obligation to create a safe and secure environment 
</p>
<p>for these displaced communities, and to ensure that, once created, these environments 
</p>
<p>remain secure. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 Operation Decisive Summer 1 in 2014 and Operation Decisive Summer 2 in 2015 were the most 
</p>
<p>prominent clashes to be reported for their impact on the displacements of civilians.  </p>


<p>41. Occupation of lands by armed groups, insecurity and absence of basic infrastructure 
</p>
<p>were some of the key reasons mentioned by displaced persons preventing them from 
</p>
<p>returning to their homeland. Most of these persons, however, expressed their willingness to 
return if the security situation were to improve. The Independent Expert urges the 
</p>
<p>Government of the Sudan to create the necessary conditions for the return of internally 
</p>
<p>displaced persons to their places of origin and the international community to support this 
</p>
<p>process. 
</p>
<p>42. The Independent Expert strongly urges all parties to the conflict to respect 
</p>
<p>international human rights and international humanitarian law and to ensure humanitarian 
</p>
<p>access at all times and to protect civilians.  
</p>
<p><b> (b) Sexual and gender-based violence  
</b></p>
<p>43. The Independent Expert is particularly concerned about the prevalence of sexual and 
</p>
<p>gender-based violence throughout Darfur. This violence against women and girls includes 
</p>
<p>acts of rape and sodomy, gang rape, attempted rape and harmful traditional practices, as 
</p>
<p>well as domestic violence. From January to April 2015, UNAMID documented 27 incidents 
</p>
<p>involving 39 victims of sexual and gender-based violence. UNAMID, through its follow-up 
</p>
<p>with local sources, also established that cases of sexual violence were largely 
</p>
<p>underreported. Most victims of sexual violence are displaced women and girls attacked 
</p>
<p>while engaged in livelihood activities outside their camp. In some cases, victims are 
</p>
<p>attacked while in the supposed safety of their shelters inside the camp or while fleeing for 
</p>
<p>safety during attacks on their villages. The pattern that has emerged from these attacks 
</p>
<p>suggests that, in most cases, perpetrators cannot be identified; in other cases, attacks were 
</p>
<p>allegedly perpetrated by government security forces, signatory and non-signatory armed 
</p>
<p>factions and sometimes by individuals not part of any organized group or government 
</p>
<p>entity. 
</p>
<p>44. The general failure and sometimes reluctance of law enforcement officials to register 
</p>
<p>or investigate sexual violence offences appropriately continues to impede victims&#8217; access to 
</p>
<p>justice. In some cases of sexual and gender-based violence, victims cite their lack of trust in 
</p>
<p>the local authorities to take appropriate action as the reason for not reporting attacks. 
</p>
<p>Although some cases reported to the local authorities have led to a prosecution, the vast 
</p>
<p>majority of perpetrators go unpunished, while others seek an out-of-court settlement. In 
</p>
<p>addition, the requirement that victims of sexual and gender-based violence fill in &#8220;form 8&#8221; &#8211; 
</p>
<p>a document used by the police to obtain a forensic opinion regarding a crime from an 
</p>
<p>authorized government expert &#8211; continues to pose a challenge to victims in their access to 
</p>
<p>justice, despite the fact that, in 2004, the Federal Ministry of Justice issued a circular that 
</p>
<p>exempted victims of sexual and gender-based violence from this procedure. A decade later, 
</p>
<p>some victims of sexual and gender-based violence are still required to complete form 8 
</p>
<p>before they can have any access to medical assistance or criminal justice services. 
</p>
<p>45. The difficulties encountered by UNAMID in gaining access to information, sites and 
</p>
<p>victims of alleged human rights violations and abuses continued to impede the reporting of 
</p>
<p>cases of sexual and gender-based violence. The Independent Expert nonetheless noted that 
</p>
<p>some steps were being taken by the Government of the Sudan to respond to violence 
</p>
<p>against women, including the legal reform of the controversial article 149 of the Sudanese 
</p>
<p>Criminal Code (see para. 15 above), which now dissociates the definition of rape from 
</p>
<p>adultery, as well as establishing of bodies that address of gender-based violence at the local 
</p>
<p>level, to address violence against women in the Darfur States. While these steps are 
</p>
<p>welcomed, concrete measures to prevent and address sexual and gender-based violence and 
</p>
<p>other forms of violence against women should be developed at the earliest opportunity.  </p>


<p><b> (c) Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>46. In Darfur, widespread poverty, compounded by poor infrastructure and health and 
</p>
<p>social services, as well as environmental hazards, has been further exacerbated by the 
</p>
<p>ongoing armed conflict, which has adversely affected the conditions necessary for the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of such basic rights as the rights to food, housing, health, water, sanitation and 
</p>
<p>education by the civilian population.  
</p>
<p>47. Poverty levels in Darfur are among the highest in the country; almost two thirds of 
</p>
<p>the population live below the poverty line. Land occupation and land use issues are a 
</p>
<p>recurring issue in all parts of Darfur. In particular, issues of access to land often trigger 
</p>
<p>intercommunal conflict in the region. While the entire population of Darfur has been 
</p>
<p>affected by the crisis, women, by virtue of their social and legal status and as a result of 
</p>
<p>traditional norms and customs, face increased discrimination, which has a negative impact 
</p>
<p>on their enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights.  
</p>
<p>48. The Government does not appear to have records, information and reliable statistics 
</p>
<p>that would enable it assess the progressive implementation of its obligations under the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights, which the State has 
</p>
<p>ratified. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile 
</b></p>
<p>49. During the period under review, several reports were received of human rights 
</p>
<p>violations in the States of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile. The violations included 
</p>
<p>systematic attacks against civilians by both government forces and armed opposition groups 
</p>
<p>and bombing in areas populated by civilians in the Nuba Mountains &#8211; acts contrary to the 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian principles of distinction and proportionality. According to 
</p>
<p>information received by the Independent Expert, between January and April 2015, the 
</p>
<p>Sudanese Air Force dropped approximately 374 bombs in 60 locations in Southern 
</p>
<p>Kordofan. The aerial bombardments and ground shelling resulted in the deaths of an 
</p>
<p>estimated 35 civilians and injured a further 70 individuals, and damaged civilian objects, 
</p>
<p>including villages, schools and mills.  
</p>
<p>50. Reports indicate that a hospital run by M&#233;decins sans Fronti&#232;res in Southern 
</p>
<p>Kordofan was bombed, in violation of international humanitarian law, on 20 January 2015, 
</p>
<p>forcing the suspension of all medical activities.. The organization decided on 29 January 
</p>
<p>2015 to shut down its operations in the Sudan owing to the restrictions on its activities. The 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert also received information on a surge in fighting on the ground between 
</p>
<p>government forces and the Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N), in 
</p>
<p>particular following the elections. The fighting caused the displacement of approximately 
</p>
<p>50,000 people in the States of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile in May 2015.  
</p>
<p>51. Violations of human rights and international humanitarian law were also perpetrated 
</p>
<p>by armed movements. On 12 March 2015, a attack by SPLM-N on Kalogi in Southern 
</p>
<p>Kordofan reportedly resulted in 40 civilian deaths, 45 injuries and the displacement of 
</p>
<p>25,000 people. On 25 June, another attack by SPLM-N in Southern Kordofan is said to 
</p>
<p>have led to the death of a dozen civilians and the wounding of approximately 100 others.  
</p>
<p>52. The Independent Expert remains deeply concerned at the situation in the States of 
</p>
<p>Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile, and reiterates his willingness to visit these regions 
</p>
<p>during his next visit to the Sudan with a view to assessing the ongoing situation.  </p>


<p><b> V.  Assessment of the situation of human rights  
</b></p>
<p>53. Despite some progress made in the legislative reform, some remaining challenges 
</p>
<p>severely impede any significant improvement in the overall situation of human rights in the 
</p>
<p>Sudan. Most of the recommendations made by the previous mandate holder remained 
</p>
<p>largely unimplemented during the period under review. In addition, the African 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights recently published a ruling of March 2014 in 
</p>
<p>which it found the Sudan responsible for violating the rights of three Sudanese nationals by, 
</p>
<p>inter alia, illegal incarceration and torture. The Commission has requested the Government 
</p>
<p>to compensate the victims.  
</p>
<p>54. The ongoing violence in Darfur and in the States of Southern Kordofan and Blue 
</p>
<p>Nile has been marked by widespread impunity. Perpetrators of human rights violations and 
</p>
<p>abuses and violations of international humanitarian law, including government security 
</p>
<p>forces and affiliated-militia and armed opposition movements, have rarely been held to 
</p>
<p>account for their actions. The judicial response to these violations and abuses continues to 
</p>
<p>be weak. In particular, the Independent Expert stresses that combating impunity should be a 
</p>
<p>foremost priority of the Government of the Sudan that should include ensuring effective, 
</p>
<p>efficient access to justice for victims of human rights violations and abuses. 
</p>
<p>55. There have been restrictions on political rights and fundamental freedoms, including 
</p>
<p>the freedom of expression, freedom of the press, the freedom of association and peaceful 
</p>
<p>assembly, forced disappearances, sexual and gender-based violence, arbitrary arrests and 
</p>
<p>detentions, torture and degrading treatment perpetuated by security forces and armed 
</p>
<p>movements against the civilian populations as well as denial of humanitarian access to 
</p>
<p>conflict-affected areas. The Independent Expert calls upon the Government of the Sudan to 
</p>
<p>facilitate access to the affected population for delivery of humanitarian assistance. 
</p>
<p>56. The Independent Expert continued to receive reports of prolonged detention of 
</p>
<p>persons without access to legal representation or to their families. He calls upon the 
</p>
<p>Government of the Sudan to respect the political and civil rights and fundamental freedoms 
</p>
<p>enshrined in the interim national Constitution and to allow the Sudanese people to exercise 
</p>
<p>their rights freely. He also calls upon the Government to release all detained persons or to 
</p>
<p>charge and prosecute them in accordance with the law.  
</p>
<p>57. The Independent Expert is concerned that the death penalty continues to be applied, 
</p>
<p>and that lashing is used as a routine penalty, in contravention of international human rights 
</p>
<p>law. Moreover, the use of torture is a clear contravention of international law and article 33 
</p>
<p>of the interim national Constitution. 
</p>
<p>58. The Independent Expert notes that all his governmental interlocutors raised the issue 
</p>
<p>of unilateral coercive sanctions against the Sudan, qualifying them as a serious violation of 
</p>
<p>basic human rights because of their negative impact on the situation of human rights. 
</p>
<p>During the visit of the Independent Expert, the Government organized a forum on the 
</p>
<p>negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights. The 
</p>
<p>Government underscored the negative impact of these measures on the Sudanese people, in 
</p>
<p>particular on women and children. It also advocated for the lifting of sanctions by the 
</p>
<p>international community, seeking instead an international engagement to a broad 
</p>
<p>programme of technical assistance for the Sudan. 
</p>
<p>59. The Independent Expert raised the matter with the newly appointed Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the negative impact of the unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of 
</p>
<p>human rights, Idriss Jazairy, for appropriate follow-up. </p>


<p><b> VI.  Technical assistance and capacity-building 
</b></p>
<p>60. The establishment of the National Commission for Human Rights, the Advisory 
</p>
<p>Council for Human Rights and other governmental human rights bodies, such as the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Committee of the National Assembly, the Unit to Combat Violence against Women 
</p>
<p>and Children, the National Council for Child Welfare, the Family and Child Protection Unit 
</p>
<p>of the police force, the Darfur Regional Authority, the Special Court for Darfur Crimes and 
</p>
<p>others ministerial units or commissions is a sign of institutional progress in the field of 
</p>
<p>human rights in the Sudan. The Independent Expert takes notes their establishment with 
</p>
<p>satisfaction, and encourages the Government to provide further support for their 
</p>
<p>independence and financial autonomy, in particular of the National Commission for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights. 
</p>
<p>61. Despite the fact that administrative control over some of the above-mentioned 
</p>
<p>bodies and mechanisms could appear to be excessive, it remains necessary to continue to 
</p>
<p>strengthen and work with them. Local civil society organizations also have their role to 
</p>
<p>play, and need to be strengthened as well so as to make meaningful progress in the 
</p>
<p>improvement of human rights in the Sudan.  
</p>
<p>62. There is, to a large extent, some level of consensus among stakeholders of the need 
</p>
<p>for capacity-building in the form of relevant human rights training for members of these 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, as well as of the judiciary, the police, the National Security Service and non-
</p>
<p>governmental human rights organizations. The need for public awareness and human rights 
</p>
<p>empowerment initiatives were also identified. Technical assistance and capacity-building 
</p>
<p>initiatives are, however, capital-intensive and require high levels of funding, which must be 
</p>
<p>sourced both internally from the Government itself and externally from different 
</p>
<p>cooperating partners within the donor community and institutions.  
</p>
<p>63. In his meetings with UNAMID, United Nations agencies and members of the 
</p>
<p>diplomatic corps, the Independent Expert was informed of a number of ongoing support 
</p>
<p>and technical assistance programmes for the Sudan in the field of human rights. He urges 
</p>
<p>other donor countries and the international community to provide the necessary technical 
</p>
<p>and financial support to the Sudan in the field of human rights. 
</p>
<p>64. During the period under review, international partners, in particular UNAMID, the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, 
</p>
<p>provided various forms of technical assistance and capacity-building to government 
</p>
<p>institutions and civil society, as a contribution to improving the human rights situation in 
</p>
<p>the country. Mention should also be made of the training of national partners on child rights 
</p>
<p>and child protection, and of the training of prosecutors, including the Special Prosecutor for 
</p>
<p>Crimes in Darfur, the training of 400 community police volunteers and English lessons for 
</p>
<p>more than 3,000 internally displaced persons.  
</p>
<p>65. Furthermore, the Independent Expert was also pleased to observe the support 
</p>
<p>provided by international partners, including the United Nations country team and 
</p>
<p>UNAMID, to the Ministry of Justice to help to implement the universal periodic review 
</p>
<p>recommendations, in particular those related to the rights of women and children, and the 
</p>
<p>technical assistance given to the Advisory Council for Human Rights in relation to the 
</p>
<p>preparation of the national report for the second cycle of the universal period review. 
</p>
<p>Technical assistance has also been provided to the National Commission for Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>in particular in the preparation of its strategic plan and the establishment of its branch in 
</p>
<p>Darfur. He welcomes the efforts being made by UNAMID and the United Nations country 
</p>
<p>team to strengthen the capacity of civil society, including all efforts aimed at building rule 
</p>
<p>of law institutions through legislative reforms and legal aid. </p>


<p>66. It is essential for the donor community to continue its financial and technical support 
</p>
<p>for the Government of the Sudan and civil society to ensure capacity-building on human 
</p>
<p>rights.  
</p>
<p>67. The Independent Expert has identified, as an important capacity-building concern 
</p>
<p>for the Sudan, the need for human rights education, and more specifically of human rights 
</p>
<p>litigation training, and for broader empowerment of civil society. In addition, he endorses 
</p>
<p>the recommendations made by the previous mandate holder concerning the need for a 
</p>
<p>programme of technical cooperation in the field of human rights with the National 
</p>
<p>Commission for Human Rights.  
</p>
<p><b> VII.  Conclusion and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>Despite the willingness of the Government of the Sudan to continue to engage 
</b></p>
<p><b>with the international community and to discuss the situation of human rights in a 
</b></p>
<p><b>positive manner, the situation in the Sudan remains a source of serious concern. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>way to improve the situation has been outlined in a number of previous reports, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the recommendations made therein remain to be considered seriously. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>The Independent Expert underscores the centrality of human rights and of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>rule of law to peace and stability in the Sudan, and calls upon the Government of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Sudan to continue its efforts to address the conflict in Darfur as part of a holistic 
</b></p>
<p><b>approach to the challenges of peace, governance and democracy in the Sudan.</b>3<b> He 
</b></p>
<p><b>believes that the national dialogue initiative announced by the Government in 
</b></p>
<p><b>January 2014 offers an opportunity to advance democratic reforms, peace, 
</b></p>
<p><b>reconciliation and power-sharing in the Sudan.  
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>Other challenges include combating impunity and ensuring humanitarian 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to areas affected by conflicts. In this regard, the Independent Experts calls 
</b></p>
<p><b>upon the Government of the Sudan to renew its efforts in these areas to fulfil its 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights obligations. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>The Independent Expert calls upon the Government of the Sudan to 
</b></p>
<p><b>acknowledge the persistence of human rights violations and abuses in the country, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>to allow effective access by the Independent Expert and other human rights mandate 
</b></p>
<p><b>holders to visit all areas of the country, and to meet with relevant stakeholders with a 
</b></p>
<p><b>view to addressing the human rights concerns and humanitarian challenges facing the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Sudan. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The Independent Expert notes with satisfaction the renewal by the Security 
</b></p>
<p><b>Council of the mandate of UNAMID, and encourages donor States and international 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions to continue to provide it with the much-needed support with a view to 
</b></p>
<p><b>enhancing its capacity to discharge more effectively its mandate and to alleviate the 
</b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian crisis in Darfur (see S/2015/378)</b>.<b> The Independent Expert remains 
</b></p>
<p><b>particularly concerned at all hostile actions and attacks against UNAMID personnel 
</b></p>
<p><b>and assets, and against humanitarian organizations and their staff. He calls upon the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Sudan to arrest and prosecute all perpetrators of these acts, in accordance with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>principles of equitable and fair judicial process.  
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>In addition to the recommendations made by the previous mandate holder, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Independent Expert makes the recommendations below. 
</b></p>

<p><b> A. Government of the Sudan 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The Independent Expert calls upon the Government of the Sudan: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) To acknowledge the persistence of human rights violations and abuses in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the country; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) To continue and deepen its efforts to combat impunity by prosecuting all 
</b></p>
<p><b>perpetrators of human rights violations and abuses and violations of international 
</b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian law in the country; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) To prevent interference by security forces in the activities of civil society
