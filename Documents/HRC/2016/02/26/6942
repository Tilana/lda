<p><b>4/&#8230; Globalization and its impact on the full enjoyment of

<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Guided</i> by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and 
expressing in particular the need to achieve international cooperation in promoting and 
encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the Declaration on the Right to Development, adopted by the 
General Assembly in its resolution 41/128 of 4 December 1986, 
</p>
<p><i> Realizing</i> that globalization is not merely an economic process, but that it also has social, 
political, environmental, cultural and legal dimensions, which have an impact on the full 
enjoyment of all human rights, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*<b>  </b>This document is a revised version of the draft resolution circulated at the second session of 
the Human Rights Council as A/HRC/2/L.23. </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that globalization should be guided by the fundamental principles that 
underpin the corpus of human rights, such as equality, participation, accountability, 
non-discrimination, at both the national and international levels, respect for diversity, tolerance 
and international cooperation and solidarity, 
</p>
<p><i> Affirming </i>that, while globalization offers great opportunities for sustained economic 
growth and development of the world economy and offers new perspectives for the integration of 
developing countries into the world economy, at present its benefits are very unevenly shared 
and costs unevenly distributed, 
</p>
<p><i> Underlining </i>that developing countries face special difficulties in meeting the challenge of 
globalization and especially that the least developed countries have remained marginalized in the 
globalizing world economy, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned</i> at the inadequacy of measures to narrow the widening gap between the 
developed and the developing countries, which adversely affects the full enjoyment of human 
rights, particularly in the developing countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Underlining</i> that the deep fault line between the rich and the poor that divides human 
society and the ever-increasing gap between the developed and the developing countries pose a 
major threat to global prosperity, security and stability, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that, while globalization, by its impact on, inter alia, the role of the State, 
may affect human rights, the promotion and protection of all human rights is first and foremost 
the responsibility of the State, 
</p>
<p><i> Underlining</i> the shared responsibility to assist countries and people excluded from or 
disadvantaged by globalization, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Emphasizes</i> that development should be at the centre of the international 
economic agenda and that coherence between national development strategies and international 
obligations and commitments will contribute to the creation of an enabling environment for 
development, which is conducive to the full realization of all human rights for all; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 2. <i>Strongly urges</i> the international community to take stock of the slow progress 
with regard to the Millennium Development Goals, with a view to taking all necessary and 
appropriate measures, including enhanced official development assistance, the search for a 
durable solution to the external debt problem, market access, capacity-building, and 
dissemination of knowledge and technology, in order to achieve successful integration of 
developing countries in the global economy; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Stresses</i> the need to broaden and strengthen the full and effective participation of 
developing countries in international economic decision-making and norm-setting with a view to 
ensuring equitable distribution of growth and sustainable development gains in a globalizing 
world economy; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Underlines</i> the need for the treaty bodies, special rapporteurs/representatives, 
independent experts and working groups of the Council, within their mandates, to take into 
consideration the content of the present resolution; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Decides</i> to consider this issue again at its future session.
