</p>
<p><i> Recalling further </i>the Declaration on the Right to Development, which, inter alia,

realization of the right to development and should ensure, inter alia, equality of opportunity 
for all in their access to basic resources, such as health services,  
</p>
<p><i> Taking note with interest </i>of general comments and general recommendations from 
treaty bodies that are relevant to the right of everyone to the attainment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, 
</p>
<p><i> Concerned </i>that, for millions of people throughout the world, the full realization of 
the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and 
mental health, including through access to medicines that are safe, effective, affordable and 
of good quality, in particular essential medicines, vaccines and other medical products, and 
to health-care facilities and services, still remains a distant goal and that, in many cases, 
especially for those living in poverty, this goal remains remote, 
</p>
<p><i> Concerned also</i> that the increasing incidence of non-communicable diseases 
constitutes a heavy burden on society, with serious social and economic consequences, and 
aware that there is a need to respond to cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes and 
chronic respiratory diseases, which represent a leading threat to human health and 
development, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>that access to medicine is one of the fundamental elements in achieving 
progressively the full realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, and that it is the responsibility of States

medicines, that are affordable, safe, effective and of good quality,

other benefits&#8221;, which recognizes the need to implement a fair and transparent, equitable, 
efficient and effective system for the sharing of the H5N1 and other influenza viruses with 
human pandemic potential and access to vaccines and other benefits on an equal footing, 
</p>
<p><i> Concerned</i> about the lack of health workers and their imbalanced distribution within 
countries and throughout the world, in particular the shortage in sub-Saharan Africa, which 
undermines the health systems of developing countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> World Health Assembly resolution WHA58.33 of 25 May 2005 entitled 
&#8220;Sustainable health financing, universal coverage and social health insurance&#8221;, which, inter

and mental health, 
</p>
<p><i> Concerned </i>about the interrelatedness between poverty and the realization of the

health, in particular the fact that ill health can be both a cause and a consequence of 
poverty, 
</p>

the health-related Millennium Development Goals, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing </i>that gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls are 
fundamental elements for their health, including sexual and reproductive health, in the 
reduction of their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS, and that the advancement of women and girls 
is a key factor in attaining the health-related Millennium Development Goals, in particular 
the improvement of maternal health and the reversal of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and 
noting the importance of increasing investments in and accelerating research on the 
development of effective HIV prevention methods, including female-controlled methods 
and microbicides,
