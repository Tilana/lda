Accelerating Growth for NdPr
Based on the strong performance of the wind and E-car/hybrid vehicle industry, the total demand for Nd/Pr
Is expected to double in less than 10 years!
Source: IMCOA 2016 data
Triggered by…
 More demanding global emission standards and general stricter legislation for environmental un-friendly
technologies and an increasing consciousness in our society for green technologies
Translating to …
 A growing demand for more environmental, sustainable green energy sources and more high-end efficient
technologies that provide light weight solutions for sustainable green mobility
Materializing in 2 specific Megatrends …
 with an outstanding, upcoming strong demand for NdFeB permanent magnets and respectively Nd/PR

NdFeB Permanent Magnets – The Key driver for our Business
Peak’s value drivers are Neodymium and Praseodymium at ~85% of our future revenue*
* See ASX announcement “Ngualla Study delivers substantial Capex and Opex savings” of 16 March 2016”

 NdFeB (Neodymium, Iron and Boron Magnet) is the strongest permanent magnet commercially available


~10 times more powerful, and 3 times lighter than traditional ferric magnet alternatives. Superior performance under a wider range 
of operating conditions, allowing effective miniaturisation and production of compact, lightweight, and more efficient motors 
 
They form the basis for the traction motors used in many of todays leading Battery and Hybrid Electric Vehicles. Enable extremely 
high torque motors, compact, lightweight and more efficient. A PM motor is typically 10% more efficient at part load and 2–4% 
more efficient at full load compared with induction based motors

Strong Short Term Demand Outlook
The global outlook: demand by 2020 for Nd & Pr is forecast to increase by 40%, or an additional 19,455t.
**
Source: Peak extrapolation based on 4 Bloomberg New Energy Finance, 2016 . Assuming that ~300g Nd/Pr  is used in a standard car an 600g in E-vehicle
**
 Base case scenario: if we consider no incremental sales for E-cars ( 2015 base) , just organic growth of standard
cars reaching 117m in 2040, the automotive annual incremental Nd/Pr demand will increase 41% by 2040 .

**Upside scenario: if the adoption of E-vehicles accelerates and a market share of 22% will be accomplished by 
2025 (Goldman Sachs) the annual incremental Nd-Pr demand will increase by 45% by 2025 for automotive 
applications.
