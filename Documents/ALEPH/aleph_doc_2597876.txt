Review of Operations 
 
Biodiesel Refining 
The  Companies  fully  owned  Malaysian  subsidiary,  M2  Capital  Sdn  Bhd  (M2  Capital)  has  a  20% 
share of FGV Green Energy Sdn Bhd, a company that owns and is in the process of retrofitting a 
250,000 tpa refinery at Kuantan port, east coast Malaysia, with “ENSEL®” technology, to be able to 
produce biodiesel from low quality vegetable oil. The other stakeholders in this company are Felda 
Global Ventures Downstream Sdn Bhd (“FGVD”), a subsidiary of Felda Global Ventures Holdings 
Berhad, and Benefuel International Holdings S.A.R.L (Benefuel). 
 
During  the  financial  year,  the  Company  announced  that  the  ongoing  dispute  with  KNM  Process 
Systems Sdn Bhd (KNM) had been amicably settled. The material terms of the settlement are that 
Mission will pay to KNM A$4m, being the amount put aside by Mission upon the sale of Mission’s 
250,000 tpa refinery in February 2015, pursuant to a consent order agreed to by Mission and KNM 
earlier.  Both  parties  have  agreed  to  withdraw  all  other  claims  and  counter  claims  and  will 
discontinue all legal actions against each other 
Capital Markets and Funding
