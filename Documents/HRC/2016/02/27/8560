<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its ninth session from 1 to 12 
November 2010.  The review of the United States of America was held at the 9th meeting, 
on 5 November 2010. The delegation of the United States of America was headed jointly 
by the Honourable Esther Brimmer, Assistant Secretary, Bureau of International 
Organizations, Department of State; the Honourable Harold Hongju Koh, Legal Adviser, 
Office of the Legal Adviser, Department of State; and the Honourable Michael Posner, 
Assistant Secretary, Democracy, Human Rights and Labour, Department of State. At its 
13th meeting, held on 9 November 2010, the Working Group adopted the report on the 
United States of America. 
</p>
<p>2. On 21 June 2010, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of the United States of America: Cameroon, 
France and Japan. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of the United States of America: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/9/USA/1); 
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/USA/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/USA/3/Rev.1). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Plurinational State of Bolivia, the Czech 
Republic, Denmark, Germany, Japan, Latvia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, the 
Russian Federation, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to the United States of America through the 
troika. Those questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p>5. During the interactive dialogue, 56 delegations made statements. Additional 
statements, which could not be delivered during the interactive dialogue owing to time 
constraints, will be posted on the extranet of the universal periodic review when available.1 
Recommendations made during the dialogue are found in section II of the present report.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>6. The delegation expressed its pleasure at presenting its first UPR report and noted 
President Obama&#8217;s and Secretary Clinton&#8217;s deep commitment to multilateral engagement, 
human rights, and the rule of law.  The story of the United States has been one of striving 
</p>
<p>  
 1 Colombia, Panama, Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Slovenia, Nepal, Rwanda, Chad, Bhutan, Kuwait, 
</p>
<p>Belarus, Peru, Timor- Leste, Latvia, Jordan, South Africa, Iraq, Ukraine, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, 
Cameroon, Afghanistan, Burundi, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Mauritius and 
Namibia. </p>


<p>for a more perfect union. By admitting the possibility of imperfection, new opportunities to 
improve are revealed &#8211; the ability to do this has been and continues to be a source of 
national strength. 
</p>
<p>7. The United States explained that it encourages the involvement of its civil society, 
and works through law-abiding executives, democratic legislatures and independent courts 
to make progress.  The United States expressed pride in its accomplishments, recognized 
that there remains room for further progress and reiterated its commitment to principled 
engagement with  the international system to advance human rights at home and abroad.   
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>8. Cuba made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>9. The Bolivarian Republic of Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela expressed the hope 
that President Obama would make a commitment to human rights. 
</p>
<p>10. The Islamic Republic of Islamic Republic of Iran expressed concern over the 
situation of human rights and systematic violations committed by the United States at both 
the national and international levels. 
</p>
<p>11. The Russian Federation positively assessed the current Government&#8217;s efforts to 
eliminate a number of human rights violations that had been committed in the course of the 
&#8220;fight against terrorism&#8221; and to join in the work of the Human Rights Council. On the other 
hand, in a number of areas, including, first of all, acceding to the international human rights 
treaties and ensuring human rights in the process of the fight against terrorism, additional 
efforts by the United States were required. 
</p>
<p>12. Nicaragua stated that the United States had made the use of force the cornerstone of 
its expansionist policy and that Latin America was one of its victims.  It stated that the 
United States had violated human rights while pretending to be the world&#8217;s guardian of 
human rights. 
</p>
<p>13. Indonesia noted positively the United States&#8217; commitment to freedom and equality, 
and welcomed the country&#8217;s engagement with the Human Rights Council. It expressed its 
belief that the United States needed to make efforts to protect human rights in a balanced 
manner and to promote tolerance. Indonesia acknowledged the United States&#8217; contribution 
to the development of the United Nations norms. 
</p>
<p>14. The Plurinational State of Bolivia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>15. Ecuador noted the Government&#8217;s efforts to improve human rights, although the 
results had been limited. 
</p>
<p>16. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea remained concerned about the 
persistent reports of human rights violations committed by the United States at home and 
abroad. 
</p>
<p>17. Algeria stated that the election of a President of African descent had spoken louder 
than any statement about the United States&#8217; commitment to civil and political rights. 
Algeria noted that prison overcrowding was the norm and that prisons housed 60 per cent 
more inmates than they had been designed for. 
</p>
<p>18. Qatar welcomed the United States&#8217; efforts in combating racial and religious 
discrimination, providing social services and ensuring the enjoyment of economic, social 
and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>19. Mexico recognized the robust institutional infrastructure for the protection of human 
rights. </p>


<p>20. Egypt expressed the hope of seeing concrete steps undertaken by the United States 
to ensure the protection of the human rights of the members of Muslim, Arab, African-
American and South Asian communities. It remained concerned about certain policies and 
practices in the human rights field. 
</p>
<p>21. China noted the Government&#8217;s efforts in past years to promote and protect human 
rights and to make progress in health care and education. However, China expressed 
concern about the gaps in human rights legislation and the fact that the United States had 
not become a party to a number of core international human rights instruments. It was also 
concerned, inter alia, that the law enforcement agencies tended to use excessive force and 
that the incidence of poverty was higher among Afro-Americans, Latinos and Native 
Americans. 
</p>
<p>22. India commended the United States for its commitment to human rights and its 
acknowledgment of the remaining challenges. India was concerned about human rights 
abuses by business corporations and inquired about the United States&#8217; position on its Alien 
Tort Claims Act. It was concerned at the sexual harassment of women in the United States 
military and the disproportionately high conviction rates for African-Americans, as well as 
their low access to education, health and employment. 
</p>
<p>23. Bangladesh stated that, while progress had been made in the protection of civil and 
political rights, the protection of social and economic rights had not been fully recognized. 
It stated that the United States played a positive role internationally in supporting many 
countries&#8217; development efforts.  Bangladesh was concerned at the recent enactment of an 
immigration law that might encourage discriminatory attitudes and ill treatment against 
migrants. 
</p>
<p>24. Malaysia appreciated the renewed commitment expressed by the Government to re-
engage on the full range of human rights, including through United States membership of 
the Human Rights Council. Malaysia stated that several issues, such as racial 
discrimination, racial profiling, religious intolerance and widening income equality, could 
be given more attention. 
</p>
<p>25. Brazil welcomed the measures announced by the United States to address violations 
of human rights that had been committed under its counter-terrorism policy. It noted with 
concern the rise in the number of persons living in poverty. Brazil encouraged the United 
States to investigate and address situations of forced labour against migrants. 
</p>
<p>26. Switzerland noted with satisfaction that several states had abolished the death 
penalty. Switzerland also noted, inter alia, that thousands of migrants had been detained in 
harsh conditions and without access to legal counselling for violations of immigration laws. 
</p>
<p>27. The Republic of Korea commended the Government&#8217;s decision to close the 
Guantanamo Bay detention facility and to ban methods of interrogation that might not be in 
compliance with international law. It welcomed the adoption of legislation to expand access 
to health care for its citizens. 
</p>
<p>28. In addressing a number of observations and recommendations related to ratification 
of treaties, the delegation noted that its practice was to ensure that it could fully implement 
a treaty before it became a party to it and not to ratify unless it could do so. Under its 
Constitution, such ratification required approval of two thirds of the United States Senate. 
The United States was strongly committed to ratifying the CEDAW and the Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>29. In response to questions regarding the creation of a national human rights institution, 
the U.S. delegation noted that this was an issue currently under consideration in the United 
States. The United States believed that multiple levels of complementary work at the </p>


<p>federal and sub-federal levels and by different branches of government (executive, 
legislative and judicial) provided multiple and reinforcing protections for individual rights. 
</p>
<p>30. The United States then discussed other points raised by several countries: torture and 
the closing of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. 
</p>
<p>31. The delegation explained that the United States is unequivocally committed to the 
humane treatment of all individuals in detention, whether criminal detention or detainees in 
United States custody in armed conflict.  Through Executive Orders, the President affirmed 
the United States commitment to abiding by the ban on torture and inhumane treatment, 
ordered CIA &#8220;black sites&#8221; closed, and instructed that any interrogations must be conducted 
consistent with United States treaty obligations and the revised Army Field Manual.  
President Obama also ordered a review to ensure that the detention facility at Guantanamo 
Bay fully complied with Common Article 3, and established a special interagency task 
force to review United States interrogation and transfer policies and to ensure that all 
United States. transfer practices comply with United States law, policy and international 
obligations and never result in the transfer of any individual to face torture. 
</p>
<p>32. The United States reaffirmed the President&#8217;s commitment to closing the 
Guantanamo detention facility as quickly as possible, noting that the task has proven 
enormously complex and also involves United States allies, the courts, and the United 
States Congress.  The United States expressed its gratitude to those countries that had 
accepted detainees for resettlement. 
</p>
<p>33. The delegation addressed questions related to its work to combat discrimination. The 
United States is committed to ensuring political participation by all qualified voters through 
enforcement of voting rights laws. The Justice Department will review redistricting plans 
after the 2010 Census to ensure that voting districts are not drawn with the purpose or effect 
of discriminating against minority voters. The United States explained its enforcement of 
laws to ensure equal access to housing, lending, credit, educational opportunities, and 
environmental justice. Although still grappling with the legacy of slavery and addressing 
problems of racial discrimination, the United States remains mindful of the need to address 
other inequalities as well. 
</p>
<p>34. The United States is committed to promoting equal rights for women.  The 
delegation discussed the passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the creation of an 
Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women&#8217;s Issues, and other measures. 
</p>
<p>35. The delegation also noted important initiatives to ensure more robust protections for 
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals.  In addition to several non-legislative 
measures, the United States is seeking the legislative repeal of the Defence of Marriage Act 
and the &#8220;Don&#8217;t Ask, Don&#8217;t Tell law&#8221; and policy. 
</p>
<p>36. The United States continues to be a world leader in protecting disability rights. In 
addition to signing the Disabilities Convention, it vigorously enforces laws against 
architectural barriers and unnecessary institutionalization. In the past year, the United States 
filed or participated in more than a dozen lawsuits to promote full inclusion of persons with 
disabilities. 
</p>
<p>37. The delegation then addressed questions regarding the Arizona immigration law.  
The Justice Department had challenged this law on grounds that it unconstitutionally 
interferes with the federal Government&#8217;s authority to set and enforce immigration policy, 
and litigation is ongoing in which a federal judge has enjoined the law. The United States 
expressed its commitment to advancing comprehensive immigration reform. 
</p>
<p>38. Thailand noted with appreciation that the United States had initiated the ratification 
process relating to a number of human rights instruments. It also welcomed the </p>


<p>Government&#8217;s efforts to address discrimination on various grounds and to promote equality 
before the law for all. 
</p>
<p>39. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya was concerned at, inter alia, the racial discrimination 
and intolerance against persons with African, Arab Islamic and Latin American origins, the 
denial of the indigenous community of their rights, human rights violations resulting from 
its policies of occupation and invasion and the imposition of blockades. It was concerned 
over the large number of prisoners at Guantanamo, deprived of their right to a fair trial. 
</p>
<p>40.  The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland noted that the United 
States had a strong record in human rights protection and welcomed US recognition of the 
need to achieve greater equality for minorities, people with disabilities and LGBT 
individuals. It was concerned that the death penalty could sometimes be administered in a 
discriminatory manner and encouraged the United States to address those systemic issues. It 
asked about steps the United States had taken towards the ratification of Treaties and 
Optional Protocols to Conventions it had already signed. It encouraged the United States to 
redouble its efforts to ensure the closure of the Guantanamo detention facilities in a timely 
manner. 
</p>
<p>41. France welcomed the United States&#8217; pledge to ratify CEDAW and its intention to 
close the Guantanamo detention centre. It asked what measures had been taken in that 
regard and when the closure was expected. 
</p>
<p>42. Australia noted that the United States, in many ways, led by example in promoting 
human rights standards around the world. It expressed concern, however, at the country&#8217;s 
continued use of the death penalty. It remained concerned about reports of violent crimes 
against persons of minority sexual orientation. Australia welcomed the United States&#8217; 
efforts to address the gap between the rights of Native and other Americans. Australia 
encouraged the United States to become a party to CRPD. 
</p>
<p>43. Belgium noted with regret that the death penalty was still applied by some 35 states. 
It expressed concern at the situation in the prison system, including violence against 
detainees; prison overpopulation and overrepresentation of some ethnic groups; and 
imprisonment, sometimes for life, without any possible reprieve for those who were minors 
when the acts were carried out. 
</p>
<p>44. The Sudan commended the United States&#8217; efforts to promote and protect human 
rights on its territory and globally. It commended the United States for its efforts to create 
the conditions necessary for the ratification of international conventions. 
</p>
<p>45. Austria stated that the United States had set positive examples in the protection of 
human rights at the national and international levels. 
</p>
<p>46. Bahrain noted the adoption of legislation on health care. Bahrain referred to the 
recommendations made by CAT on CAT&#8217;s applicability in times of war and peace, and 
asked on the steps taken to implement that recommendation. It also referred to the 
recommendation made by CERD on the establishment of a national human rights 
institution. 
</p>
<p>47. Viet Nam noted the United States&#8217; commitment to strengthening its system of 
human rights protection. It expressed concern about the reported discrimination against 
migrants and foreigners, including Vietnamese migrants and students, and the lack of 
Government commitment to support many core international human rights instruments. 
</p>
<p>48.  Ireland welcomed progressive developments in the United States including the Hate 
Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 and the work that is being conducted towards the 
ratification of the ILO Convention No. 111. Ireland noted that the United States remains 
one of the few countries in the world that continue to apply the death penalty. Ireland asked </p>


<p>whether the United States intends to proceed to the introduction of a nation-wide 
moratorium on the death penalty. Ireland regretted that an increasing number of states 
within the United States have lifted moratoria on the death penalty and urged the United 
States to introduce a nation-wide moratorium.   Ireland welcomed the United States&#8217; 
exclusion of the death penalty for crimes committed by minors and persons with an 
intellectual disability. 
</p>
<p>49. Morocco expressed appreciation for the United States&#8217; commitment to development 
assistance and referred to a number of programmes and innovative solutions concerning 
housing rights. 
</p>
<p>50. Cyprus noted with appreciation that the United States had signed the Rome Statute 
of ICC. It was concerned about the use of the death penalty and referred to the concerns 
expressed by a number of treaty bodies related to allegations of brutality and the use of 
excessive force by law enforcement officials against migrants. 
</p>
<p>51. Spain asked questions about the closing of the Guantanamo prison, the new 
regulations on military commissions and the right to a fair trial, and the guarantees for the 
remaining detainees; and about the United States&#8217; obligations related to consular access to 
foreign detainees, particularly in relation to the <i>Avena</i> ruling. 
</p>
<p>52. The delegation addressed issues raised by a number of states, including the 
relationship between human rights and national security, the death penalty, and indigenous 
issues. The United States was committed to establishing national security policies that 
respect the rule of law.  It has redoubled its efforts over the past two years to ensure that all 
armed conflict operations comply fully with all applicable domestic and international law. 
Torture and cruel treatment are crimes in the United States and steps are taken to prosecute 
those who commit such acts.  All individuals held in armed conflict are held lawfully.  In 
response to a question from Spain, the United States said that all detainees in the US and 
Guantanamo have robust access to habeas review by its federal courts. 
</p>
<p>53. United States targeting practices, including lethal operations conducted with the use 
of unmanned aerial vehicles, comply with all applicable law. To the extent that human 
rights law may apply in armed conflict or national actions taken in self-defence, in all cases, 
the United States works to ensure that its actions are lawful. The delegation noted first, that 
international human rights law and international humanitarian law are complementary, 
reinforcing, and animated by humanitarian principles designed to protect innocent life.  
Second, while the United States complied with human rights law wherever applicable, the 
applicable rules for the protection of individuals and the conduct of hostilities in armed 
conflict outside a nation&#8217;s territory are typically found in international humanitarian law, 
which apply to government and non-government actors.  Third, determining which 
international law rules apply to any particular government action during an armed conflict 
is highly fact-specific. 
</p>
<p>54. In answer to a number of questions regarding detainee treatment, the Defence 
Department has well-established procedures for reporting detainee abuse and investigates 
all credible allegations of abuse by United States forces.  Between Iraq, Afghanistan, and 
Guantanamo, the United States has conducted hundreds of investigations regarding detainee 
abuse allegations, which have led to hundreds of disciplinary actions. All credible 
allegations of detainee abuse by United States forces have been thoroughly investigated and 
appropriate corrective action has been taken.  The United States further noted its 
commitment to ensuring that it does not transfer individuals to torture in Iraq and 
elsewhere. 
</p>
<p>55. In response to comments from a number of countries regarding capital punishment, 
the delegation noted that while the matter is a subject of earnest debate in the United States, 
as a matter of law that punishment is permitted for the most serious crimes with appropriate </p>


<p>safeguards.  Recently, the United States Supreme Court has narrowed the class of 
individuals that can be executed, the types of crimes subject to the penalty, and the manner 
by which the punishment is administered so that it is not cruel and unusual. In response to 
questions from Mexico and the United Kingdom about consular notification and foreign 
nationals on death row, the United States noted its commitment, and pending federal 
legislation, to comply with the <i>Avena</i> ICJ judgment. 
</p>
<p>56. Turning to indigenous issues, the delegation noted the many challenges faced by 
Native Americans &#8211; poverty, unemployment, health care gaps, violent crime, and 
discrimination &#8211; and the laws and programmes it has in place to address these problems.  
The United States stated its belief that tribes and their members will flourish if they are 
empowered to deal with the challenges they face.  This conclusion is reflected in law and 
policy regarding tribal self-determination.  President Obama hosted the White House Tribal 
Nations Conference at which he directed all agencies to submit plans for and progress 
reports on implementation of the Executive Order on Consultation and Coordination with 
Indian Tribal Governments.  As a result, the level of tribal consultations is now at an 
historic high. 
</p>
<p>57. In response to questions from Australia, Cyprus, Finland, and Norway, the 
delegation noted the considerable attention that has been paid to the interagency 
consultations with tribal leaders as a part of the United States review of its position on the 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  The decision to review its 
position was made in response to calls from tribes and other indigenous groups and 
individuals. 
</p>
<p>58. The United States has also taken numerous steps to address particular challenges 
faced by indigenous communities.  These include health care reform, the settlement of 
certain claims, and improvements in criminal justice issues. 
</p>
<p>59. Denmark urged the Government to follow the recommendations of the international 
community that it ensure that state and federal authorities applied a moratorium on 
executions with a view to ultimately abolishing the death penalty nationwide. It would like 
to see the United States join the vast majority of States that adhered to ICESCR, CEDAW, 
CRC and OP-CAT. 
</p>
<p>60. Finland, while welcoming the progress made by the United States in enhancing the 
rights of indigenous peoples, including the ongoing review of its position on the United 
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, asked how the Government was 
conducting the review and about the current situation with respect to the process. Finland 
also asked about measures undertaken to combat discrimination against women. 
</p>
<p>61. Ghana commended the United States for, inter alia, efforts that had transformed the 
country into a multi-racial, multi-ethnic and multi-religious society. It noted with 
appreciation that the Government continued to work to ensure that equal opportunity was 
not only guaranteed in law, but experienced by all Americans. Ghana, however, referred to 
the concerns expressed by several special procedures concerning ongoing structural 
discriminations.  
</p>
<p>62. Hungary recognized that the United States had a well-developed system of domestic 
human rights laws. However, the United States had limited obligations under the 
international human rights treaties. Hungary welcomed the change in the country&#8217;s attitude 
towards ICC, and hoped for further steps to deepen relations with it. 
</p>
<p>63. Slovakia stated that the United States had been one of the prominent global 
defenders and promoters of human rights, dedicating significant resources to that 
commitment. </p>


<p>64. The Netherlands, while noting the Government&#8217;s support for the ratification of 
CEDAW by the United States, noted with concern that no specific steps had been taken 
thus far to that end. The Netherlands also expressed concern at the use of death penalty in 
35 states. The Netherlands commended the United States for having received many visits 
by Special Rapporteurs. 
</p>
<p>65. Turkey welcomed the decision of the United States to become a member of the 
Human Rights Council. Turkey expressed its belief that the increasing multilateral 
cooperation and engagement that the United States had embraced would contribute to 
global peace and stability and constitute an important factor for the protection of the human 
rights of those belonging to minority groups, in particular Muslims and immigrants. 
</p>
<p>66. Norway noted with appreciation the role that the United States played in the 
international human rights arena. It welcomed the answers provided by the United States to 
advance questions that it had posed. Norway stated that it looked forward to the transparent 
and inclusive follow-up in the universal periodic review implementation phase. 
</p>
<p>67. Sweden welcomed the repeal of the use of capital punishment in some states, but 
regretted the recurring sentencing to the death penalty and executions in many states. 
Sweden asked the United States to elaborate on the status of the death penalty and about the 
plans to impose an official moratorium on executions towards the complete abolition of the 
death penalty. It also asked about the measures taken by the United States to ensure the full 
enjoyment of the human rights of persons deprived of their liberty. 
</p>
<p>68. The Holy See noted that &#8220;Operation Streamline&#8221; against irregular migrants should 
be suspended and asked for information about the Government&#8217;s decision to review its 
position on the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
</p>
<p>69. Italy noted with appreciation the Government&#8217;s efforts to fight economic, social, 
gender and ethnic discrimination. It noted that the death penalty was still in force in 35 
states, even though some states had applied a de facto moratorium. 
</p>
<p>70. With a view to strengthening the universal human rights system, Uruguay made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>71. The United States delegation noted that the United States criminal justice system is 
based on the protection of individual rights. The United States has acted to address a history 
of racially based law enforcement, through, among other things, enactment and 
enforcement of laws that prohibit discrimination based on race, colour or national origin by 
police departments that receive federal funds.  The United States was working actively to 
study and address persistent racial and ethnic disparities in the U.S. criminal justice system 
and to implement appropriate corrective measures. 
</p>
<p>72. The United States assured delegations that it condemns racial and ethnic profiling in 
all of its forms, and is conducting a thorough review of policies and procedures to ensure 
that none of its law enforcement practices improperly target individuals based on race or 
ethnicity.  With regard to Switzerland&#8217;s concern for juveniles, the United States delegation 
noted that the United States Supreme Court recently decided that juvenile offenders 
convicted of crimes other than homicide may no longer be sentenced to life imprisonment 
without parole.  The United States is committed to meeting its obligations under both 
international and domestic law for proper treatment of persons detained or incarcerated in 
the criminal justice system, including those in maximum security facilities.  In response to 
inquiries from the Netherlands and Sweden about prison conditions, the United States 
confines inmates in prisons and community-based facilities that are safe, humane, and 
appropriately secure, and in response to questions from the Netherlands, Latvia and 
Denmark, noted that the United States has hosted visits from eight Special Procedures 
during the past three years. </p>


<p>73. The United States addressed additional questions regarding immigration.  Over the 
last five years, it welcomed over 5.5 million new permanent residents and over 3.5 million 
new naturalized citizens, and resettled or granted asylum to nearly 425,000 refugees.  It is 
committed to improving its immigration system.  The Departments of Homeland Security 
(DHS) and Labour are working together to improve protections for migrants.  In response 
to concerns from civil society regarding immigration detention and the removal process, 
DHS has undertaken major reforms to improve detention center management, health, 
safety, and uniformity among facilities.  DHS&#8217;s reforms are designed to ensure that 
detention was used only when appropriate, in light of legal requirements and the need to 
ensure public safety.  In 2010 the United States lifted a 22-year ban on travel to the country

Refugees, the United States established that each arriving alien with a credible fear of 
persecution or torture would be considered for release; and that those who established their 
identity and did not pose a flight risk or a danger to the community would not be detained 
pending completion of their immigration proceedings.  For detained aliens, the United 
States recognizes the need to improve conditions of confinement, medical care, and the 
ability to exercise their human rights.  DHS is revising standards governing immigration 
detention conditions, implemented a new detainee locator system, and assigned new 
oversight personnel nationwide.  In the context of immigration enforcement, the United 
States recognized concerns regarding racial and ethnic profiling by local law enforcement 
officials and reaffirmed its commitment and recent actions to combat profiling through 
significantly strengthened protections and training against such discrimination. 
</p>
<p>75. The Republic of Moldova underlined the important involvement of the United States

be executed. New Zealand welcomed the signing by the United States of CPRD. 
</p>
<p>78. Haiti deplored the difficulties encountered by persons of African descent who, for

</p>

appreciation the constructive contribution of the United States in the formulation of 
international law and mechanisms. However, it noted the gap between the Government&#8217;s 
ratification and contribution to international law. 
</p>
<p>85. The United States delegation responded to a number of questions and concerns 
regarding discrimination against Muslims, Arab Americans, and South Asians.  The United 
States is committed to addressing negative stereotypes, discrimination and hate crimes 
through measures such as the creation of a 9/11 backlash taskforce, litigation to protect 
religious freedom including the right of school girls to wear the hijab, nationwide 
community outreach, and enforcement of employment discrimination laws.  The United 
States is taking concrete measures to make border and aviation security measures more 
effective and targeted to eliminate profiling based on race, religion, or ethnicity. 
</p>
<p>86. Regarding online privacy, the United States recognized that new technologies like 
the Internet demand legitimate and effective law enforcement as well as protection of 
privacy, free expression, and the rule of law.  Secretary Clinton was deeply committed to 
Internet Freedom at home and around the world, and to ensuring that the rights of free 
expression and association through the Internet were protected and defended. 
</p>
<p>87. Regarding questions related to economic, social and cultural rights, what Franklin 
Roosevelt described as &#8220;freedom from want,&#8221; the United States has focused on democratic 
solutions and civil society initiatives while courts have defined constitutional obligations 
primarily by focusing on procedural rights to due process and equal protection of the law.  
As a matter of broader public policy, the United States is committed to help create a society 
in which prosperity is shared, including social benefits provided by law. 
</p>
<p>88. The United States is committed to working to pursue laws and policies that will 
build an economy and society that lifts up all Americans.  The Government is taking on the 
structural inequalities that have too often held back some citizens.  The United States is 
taking significant measures to ensure equal opportunities and access to areas including 
housing, education, and health care.  The Government is actively responding to the 
foreclosure crisis by helping millions of families restructure or refinance their mortgages to 
avoid foreclosure.  The United States has taken important measures to help lift up every 
child in every school in the country, particularly those most disadvantaged.  Recent 
legislation allowed schools to invest in technology, teacher development, and other 
measures.  In 2010, President Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, which is 
projected to expand health insurance to 32 million Americans who would otherwise lack 
coverage. 
</p>
<p>89. The United States is also committed to enforcing employment and labor laws to 
protect workers&#8217; rights, has revitalized its engagement with ILO, and is renewing work on 
ratification of ILO conventions. </p>


<p>90. In closing, the United States delegation expressed its deep appreciation to civil 
society &#8211; not only for helping in the preparation of its report and presentation, but also in 
continuing to push the government to do better.  United States civil society has been 
invaluable to the United States&#8217; Universal Periodic Review, and commended to other states 
active engagement with civil society throughout the process. 
</p>
<p>91. It is a testament to the steady erosion of barriers of race, gender, sexual orientation, 
religion, disability, and ethnicity that United States delegation members of such diversity 
were present to speak for the United States today.  The United States is proud of its record 
of accomplishments, humbled by the recognition that more work remains, and remains 
committed to improvement and to continuing this dialogue going forward.
