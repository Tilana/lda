Lehlohonolo Bernard Kobedi) v. Botswana
Summary of Facts
1. The Communication is submitted by Brain Spilg an advocate in South Africa and Unoda Mack, an
Attorney with Mack Bahuma & Moncho based in Botswana. The authors of the Communication are
appointed pro deo 1 representatives for Mr. Lehlohonolo Bernard Kobedi (hereinafter Kobedi), now
deceased.
2. The Complainants allege that on the 14 October 1998, Kobedi was convicted and sentenced to death by
the High Court of Botswana for murder of a Sergeant of the Police force of Botswana - Sgt. Kebotsetswe
Goepamang on 22 May 1993.
3. According to the Complainants, it is alleged that Sgt. Kebotsetswe Goepamang died as a result of a
bullet wound, received during the course of a police manhunt on the 22 May 1993 from Kobedi who had
escaped from custody. The Complainants however maintained that the shot had been fired by another
policeman and not by Kobedi. They claim that he had been wrongly charged with the murder of Sgt.
Kebotsetswe Goepamang.
4. The Complainants submit that Sgt. Goepamang had been shot by a high velocity firearm, AK 47, a type
used by the police force and not a low velocity firearm such as found in possession of the accused/victim
which was a Kalashnikov 9mm. It is further submitted by the Complainants that were it not for gross
medical mismanagement by the hospitals and medical staff treating sergeant Goepamang, he would not
have died from injuries. The Complainants state that during the trial, crucial ballistic analysis and expert
medical evidence was adduced which revealed a contradiction in the initial ballistic analysis relied upon by
the Court to convict Kobedi. They claim that there was gross medical negligence towards Sgt.Goepamang
during his time in hospital.
5. However, the Complainants allege that the Court refused to receive or test the said objective, material
and compelling evidence thereby violating Articles 4, 5 and 7 of the African Charter on Human and
Peoples' Rights (hereinafter the African Charter). They claimed that this evidence was critical to proving the
innocence of Kobedi and to addressing the question whether the death sentence was the most appropriate
punishment.
6. The Complainants also submit that the compulsory requirement under Botswana legislation for Court to
impose a death sentence for murder where no extenuating circumstances are shown violates Articles 2, 3,
4, 5 and 7 of the African Charter.
7. Furthermore, the Complainants submit that Kobedi was living under fear of the imposition of the death
sentence for over a decade since he was first arrested and was on death row since September 1998. The
complainants allege that the long delay in trying Kobedi also exposed him to unnecessary cruel, inhuman
and degrading treatment for the reason that he had lived for an unconscionable amount of time awaiting the
imposition of a death sentence.
8. It is also allege by the Complainants that Kobedi was likely to suffer unnecessary inhuman treatment and
punishment not only because the execution will be carried out by the cruel method of death by hanging, but
also because he was aware that his medical ailment would have caused him greater and more prolonged
agony during the execution than if he were medically fit.
9. Kobedi was executed before the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (hereinafter the
African Commission or the Commission) could initiate an appeal for Provisional Measures.
10. From the foregoing, the Complainants request the African Commission to:
• Hold that there has been a violation of Articles 2, 3, 5 and 7 of the African Charter by the
Respondent State.
• Urge the Respondent State not to impose the death sentence on the victim and not to carry out the
death sentence by the method of hanging.
• Adopt such further or other recommendations and procedures as to protect the victim's rights under
the African Charter.

Submissions on Locus Standi
Respondent State's Submissions on Locus Standi

59. The African Commission was seized of this Communication at its 34th Ordinary Session held in Banjul,
The Gambia from 6 to 20 November 2003.
60. In its preliminary submissions, the Respondents State argues that the Communication should be
declared inadmissible on the ground that the authors lacked locus standii to submit or assume authorship
of the Communication. The Respondent State argues that both Unoda Mack, a national of Botswana, and
Brain Spilg SC, a national of South Africa were briefed as pro deo to argue the appeal of Kobedi before the
Botswana Court of Appeal at the instance of the Registrar of the High Court of Botswana. The Respondent
State argues that though Kobedi accepted to have them as his legal representatives, they were not, as it
were, the personal choice of Mr. Kobedi.
61. The Respondent State submits that the Communication dated 11 July 2003 and addressed to the
African Commission was signed by Kobedi. However, it argues that paragraph 15 of the Complainants
written submissions on Admissibility sent by Email on 4 March 2004 lists the two lawyers as the authors of
the Communication. The Respondents State assert that the said written submissions, do not, indicate to the
African Commission the legal interest that Messrs Brain Spilg SC and Unoda Mack, jointly and severally,
have in the Communication such that they should assume authorship of it, and the basis and source of that
legal interest. The Respondent State argues that, instead, what Brain Spilg SC and Unoda Mack attempt to
do in paragraph 3-14 of the submissions on Admissibility is to make a case for the African Commission to
hear a matter originated by the deceased.
62. The Respondent State adds that Brain Spilg SC is a national of a foreign country, and as such, the only
connection he has with Botswana is in relation to the privilege accorded him by Botswana to appear before
her Courts. The Respondent State therefore questions whether Brain Spilg SC has any legitimate legal
interest in the affairs of the country?
63. The Respondent State further argues that neither the laws of Botswana nor international laws
incorporate the actio popularis doctrine. Consequently, Messrs Brain Spilg SC and Unoda Mack must
demonstrate a sufficient legal interest in the Communication for them to possess locus standi to author it.
The Respondent State contends that in adhering to the African Charter, it did not understand that it was
giving strangers the carte blanche to occupy Botswana and utilize its resources in dealing with
Communications of this nature.
64. Accordingly, the Respondent State submits that although the Communication was originally and
properly before the African Commission, it does not have an author to pursue it, as Brain Spilg SC and
Unoda Mack do not have the competency to pursue the matter on behalf of Kobedi who is now deceased.

4

Complainants' Submissions on Locus Standi

65. In response to the Respondent State's submissions, the Complainants confirmed they were appointed
by the Registrar of the High Court of Botswana to represent Kobedi during the proceedings before the
Botswana Courts. They argue that Brain Spilg SC has practiced Law in Botswana since 1982, and in spite
of the changes in the law affecting practice by non-resident practitioners, Brain Spilg SC had continued to
receive instructions from the Government of Botswana and its parastatal bodies, ordinary corporations and
individuals. The Complainants said the facts that advocate Brain Spilg SC is not a citizen of Botswana is
irrelevant to the authorship of this Communication because it is not a requirement under the African
Commission's Communication procedure. Indeed the Complainants states that the Victim (Kobedi), as well
as other accused persons whose capital cases have not been finally disposed of, are non-citizens of
Botswana.
66. On the question of lack of interest, the Complainants aver that the information on the Communication
Procedures prepared by the Secretariat of the African Commission does not require the author to indicate
their legal interest when submitting a Communication. They argue that by requiring Complainants to
indicate their legal interest, the Respondent State challenges the very purpose and function for which the
African Commission was established.
67. Additionally, the Complainants argue that Article 56 of the African Charter which governs the
Admissibility of a Communication lists only seven Admissibility requirements, and that ,,legal interest" or
,,citizenship of the Complainant" are not included in that list. They argue further that Article 56 provides a
minimum threshold requirement, which is intended to encourage, rather than stifle the submission of
allegations of human rights violations before the African Commission. Furthermore, stated that Article 56
assist the African Commission to ensure that vexatious Communications are sifted out, and allow
issue-driven Communications to be entertained by it,.
68. Regarding the Respondent State's argument that actio popularis is not part of their domestic law, the
Complainants submit that this assertion is irrelevant because the Respondent State did not sign a domestic
document, but sign an international human rights document, which by its very nature is intended to have
remedial consequences. This requires signatory States to submit themselves to scrutiny by the African
Commission in respect of the alleged violations of human and peoples' rights.
69. In conclusion, the Complainants assert that by requiring the Complainants to demonstrate direct legal
interest in a Communication would be restrictive and ,,impermissibly narrow which will fail to have regard to
the accepted constitutional norms and the express provisions of the African Charter". Furthermore, the
Complainants submit that such an approach would also fail to take into account the function and purpose of
the African Commission. Consequently, it is the Complainants' prayers that a generous and purposive
construction be given to Article 56 in order to give effect to the spirit of the African Charter.
70. The thrust of the Respondent State's submissions is that though originally properly before the African
Commission, the Communication is now without an author to pursue it as a result of Kobedi's execution.
Accordingly, the Communication should be declared Inadmissible because the present authors pursuing
the matter are without a mandate cum locus standi.
71. The objection raised by the Respondent State raises the issue of whether or not the Complainants in
this Communication have locus standi before the African Commission, that is, whether Messrs Brain Spilg
SC and Unoda Mack have any legal interest in the matter so as to assume authorship of it on Kobedi's
behalf. This issue also interrogates the principle of actio popularis within the context of the African Charter.
African Commission's Ruling on the Preliminary Determination on Locus Standi

72. Having looked at the Admissibility requirement under Article 56 and bearing in mind the objections
raised by the Respondent State on the locus standi of the Complainants, the African Commission decides
as follows:
73. The African Commission notes that neither the African Charter nor its Rules of Procedure makes
provisions on the locus standii of parties before it. In fact, the only Charter provision that could bear any
relevance to the issue of locus standi is Article 56(1) of the African Charter. This provision relates to
authors of a Communication submitted before the African Commission and provides: "Communications
relating to Human and Peoples' Rights referred to in Article 55 received by the Commission shall be
considered if they: (1) indicate their authors even if the later request anonymity; .... "
74. It is very clear that Article 56(1) simply requires that the Communication indicate its author(s), even if
they would like to remain anonymous. This provision does not specify which parties have standings before
5

the African Commission. Indeed nowhere is it stated within the African Charter or African Commission's
Rules that there should be a link between the author of a Communication and the victim of a human rights
violation.
75. In fact, the African Commission has interpreted the relevant Article 56(1) of the African Charter, and
also addressed the question of locus standi before it in the Consolidated case of Communication 54/91,
61/91, 98/93, 164/97, to 196/97, 210/98. 2 In this case, the African Commission held that: "Article 56(1) of
the Charter demands that anyone submitting Communications to the Commission relating to human and
peoples' rights must reveal their identity. They do not necessarily have to be victims of such violations or
members of their families. This characteristic of the African Charter reflects ,,sensitivity to the practical
difficulties that individuals can face in countries where human rights are violated. The national or
internationals channels of remedy may not be accessible to the victims themselves or may be dangerous to
pursue." 3 There is therefore no requirement of legal interest for the authorship of a Communication. 4
76. Consequently, the African Commission has, through its practice and jurisprudence, adopted a generous
access to its Complaint Procedure. It has adopted the actio popularis principle, allowing everyone the legal
interest and capacity to file a Communication, for its consideration. For this purpose, non- victim individuals,
groups and NGOs constantly submit Communications to the African Commission. More so, the African
Commission, has, through its Guidelines on the Submission of Communications5 , encouraged the
submission of Communications on behalf of victims of human rights violations, especially those who are
unable to represent themselves.
77. In Communication 155/966 , for example, the African Commission endorsed the actio popularis
doctrine when it "thank(ed) the two human rights NGOs who brought the matter under its purview: the
Social and Economic Rights Action Center (Nigeria) and the Center for Economic and Social Rights (USA).
Such is the demonstration of the usefulness to the African Commission and individuals of actio popularis,
which is wisely allowed under the African Charter." The actio popularis doctrine allows persons interested in
the protection of human rights in Africa to seize the African Commission on behalf of persons who for one
reason or the other, cannot do so on their own.
78. The rationale for this broad approach to locus standi is in view of the fact that the African Commission,
mandated to promote and protect human and peoples' rights in Africa7 , bears in mind the fact that in some
instances, individuals in Africa whose rights are violated, may be faced with practical difficulties that may
preclude them from pursuing national or international legal remedies on their own behalf. The African
Commission has therefore adopted the practice of entertaining Communications from persons who are
interested in protecting human rights on the continent. These may be the victims themselves or civil society
organizations acting on behalf of victims of the alleged violations.8 This actio popularis principle has been
confirmed in various subsequent decisions of the Africa Commission.9
79. Also in relation to the requirement of citizenship, the African Commission has made it clear through its
jurisprudence that the person or NGO filing the Communication need not be a national or be registered in
the territory of the Respondent State. An endless list of examples of this would include the many cases
submitted to the African Commission by individuals and NGOs of non- African origin.10
80. The African Commission, therefore, notes that the foregoing was its approach to locus standi when it
became seized of the present Communication, and is still its current approach to the issue. Accordingly, the
African Commission would address this Communication in light of its broad approach to locus standi at the
time it became seized of this Communication.
81. The African Commission further disagrees with the Respondent State's assertion that neither the laws
of Botswana nor international law incorporates the actio popularis doctrine, and notes that this is a common
practice within regional and international human rights systems which is aimed at conferring legal standing
to certain groups who will not be required to have a sufficient interest in a case or to maintain the
impairment of a right. To this effect, different bodies had setup different criteria with regards to accessibility
to their complaint mechanisms. The African Commission notes that, the European human rights system11
and the UN Human Rights Committee,12 generally requires that the person submitting a case to be a victim
of the violation. But there are exceptions to this rule, where non-victims may bring a complaint on behalf of
the victim(s).13 On the other hand, the American Convention of Human Rights permits any person or group
of persons, or any non-governmental entity legally recognized in one or more Member States of the
Organization to submit a matter before the Inter-American Commission.14 The practice of the African
Commission though somewhat similar to the actio popularis position under the Inter-American system, is
even wider as it places no restriction as to who can bring a Communication before it. As long as the
6

conditions under Article 56 of the African Charter are met by the person standing before it, the African
Commission will enter the Communication. The rationale for the Commission's comparative broader
approach to the issue of locus standi has been associated with the peculiarity of the African situation, and
the perceived generous intent of the African Charter.15
82. From the foregoing, the African Commission will entertain the Communication brought by Messrs Brain
Spilg SC and Unoda Mack, being non- victims, with no legal interest, because its jurisprudence makes it
clear that there is no requirement of ,,legal interest" for authorship of a Communication.16
83. The African Commission holds the fact that Mr. Brain Spilg SC is not a Citizen of Botswana as argued
by the Respondents will have bearing on this Communication. It is simply not a requirement for authorship
of a Communication. Any interested individual can bring a Communication on behalf of a victim and such
individuals need not be citizens of States Parties to the African Charter. The fact that Mr. Brain Spilg SC is
a national of another country is immaterial. As long as he satisfies the conditions set out in Article 56 of the
African Charter, the African Commission will entertain the Communication as it has done, in several other
cases where Communications have been instituted by non-nationals of States against whom the
Communication is being instituted.17
84. The African Commission is therefore unable to agree with the Respondent State's argument which
seems to infer that citizenship of the authors of the Communication is a criterion within the provision of
Article 56(1) of the African Charter. This would not only be tantamount to reading new criteria into the
provision, but would also restrict the open-ended spirit found therein. Consequently, the Respondents
State's argument that the Communication is now without an author to pursue it as a result of Kobedi's
execution is also unsustainable as the present Communication is properly before the African Commission
in terms of Article 56(1) of the African Charter.
85. The African Commission hereby concludes that the Complainants in this matter possess locus standi
before it, and will however proceed to examine the Communication in view of the other Admissibility
requirements.
The Law on Admissibility
Complainants' Submissions on Admissibility

86. The Complainants submit that they have fulfilled all the requirements of Article 56 of the African
Charter.
87. The Complainants submit that the Communication is jointly presented by Advocate Brain Spilg SC
assisted by Attorney Unoda Mack and Ms Alica Mogwe (on behalf of Ditshwanelo). By detailing their
contact email addresses as spilg@law.co.za for Brain Spilg SC and legal.ditshwanelo@info.bw for
Ditshwanelo, the Complainants argue that they complied with Article 56(1) of the African Charter.
88. With regards to Article 56(2) of the African Charter, the Complainants contend that not only have they
outlined the Charter provisions which are allegedly violated by the Respondent State to include Articles 1,
2, 3, {{4,4}, 5 and 7 of the African Charter, but that they have also made submissions in support of the
alleged violations. The Complainants submit that the Communication, therefore, satisfies the requirements
of Article 56(2) of the African Charter.
89. With regards to the requirement of decorum, the Complainants submit that the tone of language used in
the Communication meets the requirement of Article 56(3) of the African Charter.
90. Concerning the requirement of evidential weight envisaged under Article 56(4) of the African Charter,
the Complainants aver that the Communication is based on primary evidence that has been either verified
under oath or is within the personal knowledge of the authors. While conceding that there is a single
reference to a media article, the Complainants argued that not only is that information tangential, but also
that the source of the article is verified under oath by the newspaper's editors and forms part of the records
of the Botswana Court of Appeal. The Complainants submit that the provisions of Article 56(4) have been
adequately met.
91. On the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies under Article 56(5) of the African Charter, the
Complainants aver that they have exhausted all available local remedies with respect to Kobedi's case. In
particular, aver the Complainants, the highest Court in Botswana, the Court of Appeal, has determined the
case. They therefore submit that the Communication satisfies the requirements of Article 56(5) of the
African Charter.
92. With regards to the reasonable time factor under Article 56(6) of the African Charter, the Complainants
7

argue that the Communication was submitted within a period of four months since the Kobedi's stay of
execution appeal was disposed of by the Botswana Court of Appeal. The Communication, argues the
Complainants, also meets the requirements of Article 56(6) of the African Charter.
93. With regards to Article 56(7) of the African Charter, the Complainants submit that the instant case has
not previously been determined by the African Commission and there are no other international avenues
that are being explored by the Complainants as far as this matter is concerned. The Communication,
contends the Complainants, satisfies the provision of Article 56(7) of the African Charter.
Respondent State's Submissions on Admissibility

94. In its written submission dated 25 May 2004 the Respondent State asserted that it did not concede the
other grounds upon which the Complainants rely for the Admissibility of the Communication.
95. However, in its oral submission made at the African Commission's 36th Ordinary Session held from 23
November to 7 December 2004 in Dakar, Senegal, the Respondent State opted not to furnish further
submissions apart from those on locus standi. The Respondent State stated that in the event that the
African Commission rules in favor of the Complainants on the issue of locus standi, they would not contest
the Admissibility of the Communication.
Commission's Decision on Admissibility

The Admissibility of the Communications submitted before the African Commission is governed by the
seven conditions set out in Article 56 of the African Charter.
96. The current Communication is submitted pursuant to Article 55 of the African Charter which allows the
African Commission to receive and consider Communications, other than from States Parties. Article 56 of
the African Charter provides that the admissibility of a Communication submitted pursuant to Article 55 is
subject to seven conditions.18 The African Commission has stressed that the conditions laid down in Article
56 are conjunctive, meaning that if any one of them is not satisfied, the Communication will be declared
inadmissible.
97. Article 56(1) of the African Charter requires that a Communication received under Article 55 of the
African Charter shall be considered if it "indicates their authors even if the latter requests anonymity".
Article 56(1) of the African Charter will, therefore, be satisfied if the Communication discloses the identity
and details of the authors thereof.19 The purport and intent of Article 56(1) of the African Charter is to
ensure that the African Commission is in communication with the author. It is only through this medium of
communication that the African Commission will be assured of the author's continued interest in the case,
or to request, as provided for under Rule 104 of the Rules of procedure, supplementary information if the
case so requires.20
98. In the instant Communication, the Complainants have disclosed that it is jointly presented by Advocate
Brain Spilg SC assisted by Attorney Unoda Mack and Ms Alica Mogwe (on behalf of Ditshwanelo). The
Communication also discloses the contact Email addresses of the Complainants as spilg@law.co.za for
Brain Spilg SC and legal.ditshwanelo@info.bw for Ditshwanelo. The African Commission is, therefore,
holds that the Complainants have complied with Article 56(1) of the African Charter.
99. Article 56(2) of the African Charter requires that the Communication must be compatible with the
Constitutive Act of the African Union and with the African Charter. With respect to the Constitutive Act, the
African Commission will not receive any Communication brought before it, which seeks a prayer a remedy
of which will contravene any provision of the said Constitutive Act. Thus, in Katangese's Peoples'
Congress V. Zaire,21 a redress which infringed on the doctrine of Uti Possidetis Juris22 enshrined in Article
3 of the OAU Charter and now in Article 4 (b) of the Constitutive Act, was rejected and the case declared
Inadmissible.
100. In Kevin Mgwanga Ngumne et al V. Cameroon,23 the African Commission, drawing inspiration from
its previous decisions affirmed that, the condition relating to compatibility with the Charter, basically
requires that: (a) the Communication should be brought against a State party to the African Charter;24 (b)
the Communication must allege prima facie violations of rights protected by the African Charter;25 (c) the
Communication should be brought in respect of violations that occurred after ratification of the African
Charter or where violations that began before the State Party ratified the African Charter have continued
even after such ratification.26 To be in conformity with the African Charter also requires the petition to
8

contain a certain degree of specificity, and that the allegations are not vague.27
101. A careful consideration of the facts and submissions from both parties to the present Communication
do not show that the instant Communication is at variance with any part of the Constitutive Act of the
African Union or the African Charter. The Commission is therefore of the view that the present
Communication satisfies the provision of Article 56 (2) of the Charter.
102. Article 56(3) of the African Charter requires that the Communication should be presented with a
certain degree of decorum. This Article prohibits the use of disparaging and/or insulting language in
presenting a Communication. Although Article 56(3) does not define what constitutes disparaging or
insulting language, the African Commission in the case of IIesanmi v. Nigeria28 the Commission held inter
alia, that, to be insulting, the language must be aimed at undermining the integrity and status of the
institution (Respondent State) and bring it into disrepute.29 In this case, the African Commission held the
Complainant's averments that, "the police and customs officials are corrupt, that they deal with drug
smugglers, that they extort money from motorists and that the President himself was corrupt and had been
bribed by the drug smugglers" as an insulting language. In Ligue Camerounaise des Droits de l'Homme
v. Cameroon,30 the African Commission also held that averments such as "Paul Biya must respond to
crimes against humanity", "30 years of the criminal neo-colonial regime incarnated by the duo Ahidjo/Biya",
"regime of torturers", and "government barbarisms"31 as insulting language.
103. However, in Bakweri Land Claims Committee v. Cameroon32 the African Commission held that the
use of strong language such as "no judge... will risk his/her career, not to mention his/her life, to handle this
politically sensitive matter..." per se will not amount to disparaging and insulting language.33
104. After a careful examination of the tone of the language used in presenting the Communication, the
African Commission is satisfied that the Complainants have met the requirements under Article 56(3) of the
African Charter.
105. Article 56(4) of the African Charter requires that any Communication brought pursuant to Article 55 of
the African Charter will be considered if the facts are not based exclusively on information from the mass
media. This requires that the Complainants must proof that, the evidence of the facts constituting the
alleged violations, are not based exclusively on information from the mass media. While conceding that
there is a single reference to news obtained from the mass media, the Complainants have argued that this
Communication is based on primary evidence within the knowledge of the Complainants.
106. In the case of Sir Dawda K Jawara v. Gambia34 the African Commission held that while it will be
dangerous to rely exclusively on news disseminated through the mass media, it would be equally damaging
if the African Commission were to reject a Communication because some aspects of it are based on news
disseminated through the mass media. For this reason, the African Commission believes that the present
Communication meets Complainants the requirements of Article 56(4) of the African Charter.
107. Article 56(5) of the African Charter on its part requires that Communications brought under Article 55
of the African Charter shall be considered only if they "are sent after the exhaustion of local remedies, if
any, unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged". The relevance of Article 56 (5) of the
African Charter is to ensure that international mechanisms are not substitutes for domestic implementation
of human rights, but should be seen as tools to assist the domestic authorities to develop a sufficient
protection of human rights in their territories.
108. The African Commission notes that the submissions of the Complainants that Kobedi's case has been
dealt with by the Botswana Court of Appeal, the apex court in the Respondent State, are relevant to the
issue of exhaustion of local remedies. The African Commission is, therefore, satisfied that the
Communication has not contravened the provision of Article 56(5) of the African Charter.
109. According to Article 56(6) of the African Charter, Article 55 Communications will be considered if
submitted to the African Commission within a reasonable time after the exhaustion of local remedies. While
the African Charter is silent as to what amounts to a reasonable time, it is important to note here that, the
issue of reasonable time is determined on a case to case bases taking into consideration all the relevant
facts. The present Communication was submitted within four months following the decision of the Botswana
Court of Appeal. The period of four months in the circumstances of this case is reasonable. The African
Commission, therefore, holds that the Complainants have satisfied Article 56(6) of the African Charter.
110. By virtue of Article 56(7) of the African Charter, Article 55 Communication will be considered if the
Communication does not deal with cases that have already been settled by African Commission or another
international settlement body. The requirement under Article 56(7) of the African Charter is founded on the
non bis in idem rule35 which ensures that no State may be sued or condemned more than once for the
same alleged human rights violations. The rule also seeks to uphold and recognize the res judicata36 status
9

of decisions issued by international and regional tribunals and/or bodies such as the African Commission.
Accordingly, the African Commission will not entertain any Communication with the same facts and
parties37 as that, which has been settled by another international body.
111. In Bob Ngozi Njoku v. Egypt38 the African Commission noted that Article 56(7) of the African Charter
"...talks about cases which have been settled..."39 and not cases which are still pending before other
international mechanisms.
112. The African Commission is satisfied that the Complainants, in their written submissions, have
exhaustively addressed the seven Admissibility requirements under Article 56 of the African Charter and
hereby declares the Communication Admissible under Article 56 of the African Charter.
Submissions on the merits
Complainants' Submissions on the Merits

113. The Complainants submit that the compulsory requirement under Botswana law for the Courts to
impose the death penalty for murder, where no extenuating circumstances are shown; the adoption of the
doctrine of "functus officio" by the Court of Appeal of the Respondent State with regards to the trial of
Kobedi; the clemency petition process and the use of hanging as a method of execution of Kobedi violates
Articles 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 of the African Charter.
Alleged Violation of Articles 2 and 3 (Right not to be Discriminated and Right to Equality before the
law)
114. The Complainants argue that the compulsory requirement under Botswana legislation that a Court
must impose the death penalty for murder, absent only extenuating circumstance limits the factors that can
be taken into consideration in respect of sentencing. They submit that the exclusion of considerations such
as rehabilitation or such other factors personal to the victim violates Articles 2 and 3 of the African Charter.
They submit that the distinction between taking into account extenuating circumstances and not taking into
account mitigating factors is both arbitrary and discriminative.
Alleged Violation of Article 4 (Right to Life)
115. The Complainants argue that because the imposition of the death penalty is qualitatively different from
any other sentence or sanction that may be imposed by a Court of Law, there is a corresponding difference
in the need for reliability in the determination that death is the appropriate punishment in a specific case.
The Complainants rely on the decision of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Downer &
Tracey v. Jamaica to argue the fact that the death penalty is an exceptional form of punishment which
must also be considered in interpreting Article 4 of the African Charter.
116. The Complainants refer the African Commission to the of case of Maauwe & Motswetla concluded in
2006 by the Court of Appeal of the Respondent State to buttress the point that the criminal justice system in
the Respondent State is not infallible. They argue that, because the criminal justice system is capable of
being fallible, the Courts should not ignore subsequent cogent evidence which if admitted could lead to the
imposition of a lesser sentence other than the death penalty. It is forcefully submitted by the Complainants
that Article 4 of the African Charter will be violated where a State Party through its judiciary imposes the
death penalty pursuant to an institutionalized process that can result in an innocent person, or a person not
deserving of the death penalty, being executed because material facts revealed post-appeal cannot be
considered by the Court.
117. The Complainants further submit that the reception of such evidence seeks to ensure that only a
person, who remains, up to the time of his execution, guilty beyond all reasonable doubts of the crime and
is deserving of no penalty other than the death sentenced, should be hanged. They argue that if it should
arise prior to the date of his hanging that the certainty of the conviction or appropriateness of the sentence
is cast into doubt by right thinking people, then such evidence must be investigated and tested, otherwise,
they submit, the execution will violate Article 4 of the African Charter.
118. It is argued by the Complainants that, if before his execution, it can be demonstrated by credible and
cogent evidence that there was an incorrect conviction or that the condemned man is deserving of a lesser
sentence than the death penalty, then the right to life protected under Article 4 of the African Charter can
only have content if such evidence can be tested. It is contended by the Complainants that the application
of the doctrine of functus officio to exclude fresh, credible and cogent evidence that could have the effect of
10

a lesser sentence violates Article 4 of the African Charter.
119. It is averred further by the Complainants that as far as the trial of Kobedi is concerned, this fresh
evidence includes, crucial ballistic analyses that Sgt. Goepamang was struck by a high velocity firearm, AK
47, a type used by the police force and not a low velocity firearm, Kalashnikov 9mm, found in possession of
the Victim; vital ballistic analyses that Sgt. Goepamang was shot from the side and not from the front as
contained in the High Court judgment; and expert medical evidence of gross medical negligence towards
Sgt. Goepamang during his time in hospital.
120. In arguing that the death penalty cannot be imposed for attempted murder in the Respondent State,
the Complainants make the point that even if the culprit/victim with premeditated intent, wished to kill his
victim, but the victim was saved by the skills of brilliant doctors, the Court has no power to sentence the
culprit to death. In the case of Kobedi, they argue that during his trial, crucial expert medical evidence was
adduced revealing gross medical negligence towards Sgt. Goepamang during his time in hospital and that
were it not for gross medical mismanagement by the hospitals and medical staff treating Sgt. Goepamang,
he would not have died from the injuries he sustained.
121. The Complainants further argue that the imposition of the death penalty on Kobedi without recourse to
any meaningful post-conviction enquiry as to the appropriate sentence to be imposed by the Courts in the
Respondent State also offends Article 4 of the African Charter.
Alleged Violation of Article 5 (Torture, Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment)
122. The Complainants contend that Kobedi, according to his Medical Report suffers from a weak heart
condition. They also state that the Medical Report proves that Kobedi does not only have an A-V shunt but
also needs surgery. They inform the African Commission that the Medical Report presents the following
conditions of Kobedi: left subclavian arteriovenous shunt with no present evidence of heart failure or
arrhythmia; irritable bowel syndrome; and mild degenerative osteoarthritis of the spine. It is
submitted by the Complainants that Kobedi was a sick man whose health condition ought to have been
taken into consideration in deciding the method to be adopted for his execution.
123. The Complainants further submit that the adoption of hanging as a method of executing the death
penalty, and the failure of the Courts in the Respondent State to have regard to the medical condition of
Kobedi violates Article 5 of the African Charter, not so much because he is aware that his medical ailment
will cause him greater and more prolonged agony during the execution than if he were medically fit, but
also because execution by hanging exposes the condemned man to a higher likelihood of unnecessarily
painful and torturous death through strangulation.
124. The Complainants aver that the post-appeal process dealing with Clemency Petitions also constitutes
a violation of Article 5 of the African Charter in that the victim, his lawyers and family members were not
informed of the unsuccessful outcome of the Clemency Petition, thus, depriving the convict and his family
members the important opportunity to have closure with the dignity of their last farewells.
125. It is submitted by Complainants that the victim had been under the fear of the death penalty for over a
decade since he was first arrested and that this prolonged delay constitutes cruel, unusual or degrading
punishment or treatment for the reason that he lived for an unconscionable amount of time awaiting the
potential imposition of a death sentence, rendering the victim's execution a violation of Article 5 of the
African Charter.
Alleged Violation of Article 7 (Right to Fair Trial)
126. The Complainants argue that the death penalty cannot be imposed for attempted murder in the
Respondent State, and that even if the culprit with premeditated intent, wished to kill his victim, but the
victim was saved by the skills of brilliant doctors, the Court has no power to sentence the culprit to death in
terms of the criminal code of the Respondent State. In further emphasizing that during Kobedi's trial, crucial
expert medical evidence was adduced revealing gross medical negligence towards Sgt. Goepamang during
his time in hospital and that were it not for gross medical negligence Sgt. Goepamang, would not have
died, the Complainants submit that the lawyer who initially represented Mr. Kobedi, not only failed to
consider the above aspects, but that he did not also have access to the medical records of the deceased
and lacked the resources to engage forensic experts.
127. The Complainants submit that the above situation could only be made possible by one of two reasons;
that counsel dealing with the matter at that initial stage did not have the necessary skills and competence
required in defending a death penalty case; or the evidence could not be expected to have been acquired
by the lawyer at that stage and therefore amounts to new evidence discovered after the appeal. They
11

further argue that this lack of competence on the part of counsel vitiated the entire proceedings and
amounted to a breach of the fair trial procedure provided for in Article 7 of the African Charter.
128. The Complainants also submitted that this fresh evidence was not only critical to the determination of
Kobedi's guilt, and the question whether the death sentence was the most appropriate sentence in the
circumstance, but that the refusal by the Court of Appeal of the Respondent State to receive or test the said
objective, material and compelling evidence also violated Kobedi's fair trial rights guaranteed under Article
7 of the African Charter.
129. The Complainants submit that the test adopted by the Botswana Court of Appeal which required the
victim to prove beyond all reasonable doubt on affidavit that the new evidence would upset the conviction,
instead of the balance of probability test is overly broad. It is further submitted by the Complainants that
under the due process guarantees, the State ought to present evidence in rebuttal of the expert testimony
presented in favor of Kobedi and that if the State had even presented such contrary expert evidence, there
would still have been a need for an expert conference to determine if the experts can resolve points of
departure, failing which the evidence should be tested. It is further argued by the Complainants that the
non-compliance with this procedure amounted to a violation of the fair trial rights of the victim protected
under Article 7 of the African Charter.
130. The Complainants contends that by relying on the evidence of an unqualified forensic expert and by
refusing to receive and test the evidence of a qualified forensic expert to determine the source and direction
of the bullet which struck Sgt. Goepamang, amounts to a fundamental miscarriage of justice and thus a
violation of Article 7 of the African Charter.
Respondent State's Submissions on the Merits

131. The Respondent State submits as a preliminary issue, that the procedure adopted by the African
Commission in dealing with the post-admissibility processes in this Communication contravenes Rule
119(2) (3) of the African Commission. It contends that by virtue of Rule 119 (2), once the African
Commission decides on the Admissibility of a Communication, the Respondent State shall file its
submissions without any further reference to the Complainants and the Complainants should only be
allowed to reply to the State's submission in terms of Rule 119 (3).
132. It is further contended by the Respondent State that by virtue of the above, the Complainants are
required to disclose the full particulars of their Complaint at the very initial stage. In submitting that the
African Commission erred when it simultaneously asked both the Complainants and the Respondent State,
to make their submissions on the Merits, the Respondent State prays the African Commission to purge and
expunge from its records any submissions made by the Complainants in this regard.
133. With regards to the substantive matter, the Respondent State argues that the compulsory requirement
under Botswana law for the Courts to impose the death penalty for murder, where no extenuating
circumstances are shown; the adoption of the doctrine of "functus officio" by the Court of Appeal of the
Respondent State with regards to the trial of Kobedi and the use of hanging as a method of execution of
Kobedi does not in anyway contravene Articles 2, 3, {{4,4}, 5 and 7 of the African Charter.
On the Alleged Violation of Articles 2 and 3 (Right not to be Discriminated and Right to Equality
before the law)
134. Concerning the alleged violation of Article 2 of the African Charter, the Respondent State submits that
this Article deals with the issue of discrimination, and argued further that the legislation in the Respondent
State did not in any way discriminate against the victim as the death penalty would be imposed on anyone
found guilty of murder without any extenuating circumstance.
135. In reply to the alleged violation of Article 3 of the African Charter, the Respondent State, while noting
that this Article deals with the twin concepts of equality before the law and equal protection of the law,
submitted that the victim's right to be treated equally before the law was not interfered with in anyway by
the Respondent State throughout the trial process.
136. Concerning the allegation that the victim was not afforded equal protection of the law, the Respondent
State contends that Mr. Kobedi was at all times during the trial process provided with high quality legal
representation and was not treated unequally vis-?-vis any other person in a similar situation. These,
argues the Respondent State, shows that the allegations of the Complainants with regards to the allege
violations of Articles 2 and 3 of the African Charter are baseless.

12

On the Alleged Violation of Article 4 (Right to Life)
137. In response to the alleged violation of Article 4 of the African Charter, it is submitted by the
Respondent State, that not only is the imposition of the death penalty reasonable in the circumstance, but
also that the procedures followed before the death sentence was carried out on Kobedi did not amount to
the arbitrary taking of his life. The Respondent State further contends that the trial of Kobedi went through
the proper judicial process of the Courts in Botswana and did not at anytime derogate from the procedures
whatsoever.
138. The Respondent State avers that the jurisprudence of the African Commission did not regard the
death penalty as inherently contrary to the African Charter, but rather that such penalty should only be
imposed with necessary due process safeguards being in place. In referring the Commission to the
Thirteenth Activity Report of the Commission,40 the Respondent State argues that the African Commission
did not declare the imposition of the death penalty a contravention of Charter Rights, but urged States that
still had the death penalty to among other things limit its imposition only to crimes of the most serious
nature as well as to consider establishing a moratorium on executions.
139. The Respondent State argues that because due process was followed and safeguarded by the judicial
system of Botswana in the trial of Kobedi, his execution cannot amount to a contravention of Article 4 of the
African Charter as alleged by the Complainants.
On the Alleged Violation of Article 5 (Torture and Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment)
140. In view of the alleged violation of Article 5 of the African Charter, the Respondent State, whilst
referring the African Commission to Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
argues that, the death penalty is expressly recognized and not prohibited under international human rights
law. It is averred by the Respondent State that since the African Charter41 provides that the African
Commission shall draw inspiration from international law and human rights, including international
instruments in interpreting Charter Rights, the African Commission should not read Article 5 of the African
Charter as prohibitive of the death penalty.
141. It is submitted by the Respondent State that, because the African Charter and other international
instruments recognizes the death penalty as a form of punishment, its application cannot amount to
inhuman or degrading treatment prohibited by Article 5 of the African Charter if it is administered according
to the law.
142. It is also argued by the Respondent State that, the Communication does not reveal facts of any
inhuman conditions or treatment whilst the victim was in prison custody. It submits that even if fear, despair
and mental anguish are the inevitable concomitants of the sentence of death, the Complainants have not
demonstrated that in all circumstances of the case, the delay since the passing of the death penalty
sentence on the victim goes beyond what is constitutionally permissible. In referring the African
Commission to Supreme Court decision in Zimbabwe42 it is further argued by the Respondent State that an
element of delay between the lawful imposition of a sentence of death and the exhaustion of available
remedies is inherent in the review of the sentence; thus, even prolonged periods of detention under a
severe custodial regime on death row cannot generally be considered to constitute cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment if the convicted person is merely availing himself of appellate remedies. Thus, it is
contended that Article 5 of the African Charter has not been violated in any way.
On the Alleged Violation of Article 7 (Right to Fair Trial)
143. In conceding that there was indeed a long delay in the trial of Kobedi, the Respondent State argues
that, such delays were occasioned by the defence and not by the State. For example, the Respondent
State submits that there was a delay of up to six (6) months between July and December 2001 when Mr.
Brain Spilg SC was appointed pro deo to represent the victim because the victim rejected several pro deo
counsels including Mr. Joina and insisted on having Mr. Brain Spilg SC appointed pro deo to represent him.
Again, it argues that there was another delay of up to sixteen (16) months between November 1999 and
July 2001 in the trial because no opposing affidavits were filed on behalf of the victim. It is contended by the
Respondent State that because these delays were due in part by the indolent acts of Kobedi and his
lawyers, they cannot amount to a contravention of the fair trial rights guaranteed under Article 7(1) (d) of
the African Charter.
144. The Respondent State contends that, in refusing the new evidence from the Complainants the Court
was using tried and tested principles of law and was more than sure that this new evidence would not
change the out come of the case if a retrial was ordered. In arguing that the trial judge properly exercised
13

his discretion in refusing to order a retrial, the Respondent State submits that the due process rights of the
victim protected under Article 7 of the African Charter was therefore not violated in anyway.
The Commission's Decision on the Merits

145. The Respondent State had raised as a preliminary issue challenging any consideration by the African
Commission of any further submissions filed by the Complainants in terms of Rule 119(2) and Rule 119(3)
of the African Commission's Rules of Procedure. They argue that by virtue of Rule 119(2) , only the
Respondent State is required to make submissions after the African Commission's decision on admissibility
and the Complainants are only accorded a right to reply pursuant to Rule 119(3) . In requesting that the
submissions made by the Complainants in this direction should be expunged, it contends that by requesting
both parties to submit their arguments on the Merits, the African Commission did not properly apply Rule
119(2)& (3) of the Rules of Procedure of the African Commission.
146. The Complainants on their part did not address the African Commission on this.
Decision of the African Commission on Alleged Procedural Irregularity

147. In dealing with this issue, the African Commission will refer itself to Rule 119 of the Rules of
Procedure (1995) of the African Commission which provides:
[i][quote]
1. If the Commission decides that a Communication is Admissible under the Charter, its decision and text of
the relevant documents shall as soon as possible, be submitted to the State Party concerned, through the
Secretary. The author of the Communication shall also be informed of the Commission's decision through
the Secretary.
2. The State Party to the Charter concerned shall, within the 3 ensuing months, submit in writing to the
Commission, explanations or statements elucidating the issue under consideration and indicating, if
possible, measures it was able to take to remedy the situation.
3. All explanations or statements submitted by a State Party pursuant to the present Rule shall be
communicated, through the Secretary, to the author of the Communication who may submit in writing
additional information and observations within a time limit fixed by the Commission.
4. States Parties from whom explanations or statements are sought within specified times shall be informed
that if they fail to comply within those times the Commission will act on the evidence before it.[/quote][/i]
148. The African Commission notes that while the afore cited Rule 119(2) only makes reference to the
State Party, and Rule 119 (3) limits the choice of the Complainants to a reply only, it is important to point
out here that, the Communication Procedure under the African Charter is dealt with in three distinct phases
- [b]Seizure, Admissibility and Merits/b]. There are different requirements to be satisfied at each of these
phases. As such, the African Commission has adopted a practice that does not require the Complainants to
make a full submission in their initial address to the African Commission. This is one reason why the
African Commission will not expunge the submissions on the Merits made by the Complainants.
149. Furthermore, the African Commission believes that it will only insist on the mechanical application of
its rules where to do otherwise would occasion substantial injustice to one or both of the parties. The
Respondent State has not shown that the non-compliance with Rules 119(2)& (3) as it were, has caused a
travesty of justice in this case or has in any other way adversely affected their rights. The African
Commission maintains that the primary duty of all adjudicatory bodies whether national or international, is
to ensure that substantial justice and not technical justice, is done to all the parties in a case. The African
Commission will therefore not allow technicalities based on perceived procedural irregularities to stand on
the course of justice.
150. In view of the above, the African Commission holds that the preliminary issue raised by the
Respondent State lacks merits in the circumstances of this case and will therefore discountenance the
same.
Decision of the African Commission on the Substantive Claim

151. By this Communication, the African Commission has been invited to determine whether or not the
compulsory requirement under Botswana law for the courts to impose the death penalty for murder, where
no extenuating circumstances are shown; the adoption of the doctrine of "functus officio "43 by the Court of
14

Appeal of the Respondent State with regards to the trial of Kobedi; and the use of hanging as a method of
execution of Kobedi, constitutes a violation of Articles 2, 3, {{4,4}, 5 and 7 of the African Charter.
Alleged Violation of Articles 2 and 3
152. Article 2 of the African Charter provides: "Every individual shall be entitled to the enjoyment of the
rights and freedoms recognized and guaranteed in the present Charter without distinction of any kind such
as race, ethnic group, color, sex, language, religion, political or any other opinion, national and social origin,
fortune, birth or other status"
Article 3
1. Every individual shall be equal before the law.
2. Every individual shall be entitled to equal protection of the law.
153. Articles 2 and 3 of the African Charter, basically forms the anti-discriminatory and equal protection
provisions of the African Charter. Whilst Article 2 lays down a principle that is necessary for eradicating
discrimination in all its guises, Article 3 is important because it guarantees fair and just treatment of
individuals within the legal system of a given country.
154. The Complainants argue that the compulsory requirement under Botswana legislation that a Court
must impose the death penalty for murder, absent only extenuating circumstance limits the factors that can
be taken into consideration in respect of sentencing. They submit that the exclusion of considerations such
as rehabilitation or such other factors personal to the victim violates Articles 2 and 3 of the African Charter.
In this regard, they argue that the distinction between taking into account extenuating circumstances and
not taking into account mitigating factors is both arbitrary and discriminative.
155. Concerning the alleged violation of Article 2 of the African Charter, the Respondent State submits that
this Article deals with the issue of discrimination, and argued that the legislation in the Respondent State
did not in anyway discriminate against the victim as the death penalty would be imposed on anyone found
guilty of murder without any extenuating circumstance.
156. In reply to the alleged violation of Article 3 of the African Charter, the Respondent State, while noting
that this Article deals with the twin concepts of equality before the law and equal protection of the law,
submitted that the victim's right to be treated equally before the law was not interfered with in anyway by
the Respondent State throughout the trial process.
157. Concerning the allegation that the victim was not afforded equal protection of the law, the Respondent
State contends that Kobedi was at all times during the trial process provided with high quality legal
representation and was not treated unequally vis-?-vis any other person in a similar situation. These,
argues the Respondent State shows that the allegations of the Complainants with regards to the alleged
violation of Articles 2 and 3 of the African Charter are baseless.
158. The African Commission maintains that Article 2 of the African Charter is a guarantee that every
individual is entitled to enjoy all the rights provided for under the African Charter and that no person shall be
deprived of the enjoyment of any of the Charter rights based on his/her race, ethnic group, color, sex,
language, religion, political or any other opinion, national and social origin, fortune, birth or other status.
Therefore, for there to be a violation of Article 2 of the African Charter, it must be shown that the victim of
the alleged violation has been deprived of the enjoyment of a Charter Right on the basis of his/her race,
ethnic group, color, sex, language, religion, political or any other opinion, national and social origin, fortune,
birth or other status.
159. The African Commission further believes that the right to equal protection of the law envisaged under
Article 3 of the African Charter consists of the right of all persons to have the same access to the law and
Courts, and to be treated equally by the law and Courts, both in procedures and in the substance of the
law. While it is akin to the right to due process of law, it applies particularly to equal treatment as an
element of fundamental fairness.44 It is a guarantee that no person or class of persons shall be denied the
same protection of the laws that is enjoyed by other persons or other classes in like circumstances in their
lives, liberty and property.
160. The African Commission, therefore, believes that for there to be a violation of Article 3 of the African
Charter, it must be demonstrated that the victim of the alleged violation was not accorded the same
protection or treatment that is usually accorded to other persons in like circumstances.
161. In the present Communication it has not been shown how the victim was denied the enjoyment of any
of the Charter Rights based on his ethnic group, color, sex, language, religion, political or any other opinion,
national and social origin, fortune, birth or other status. It has not also been shown how the victim was
15

accorded differential treatment or how the victim was discriminated against by the Respondent State in
anyway. Apart from making general conclusions, the Complainants did not sufficiently present facts and
evidence that would convince the African Commission of any violation of Articles 2 and 3 of the African
Charter. The African Commission therefore finds that there was no violation of Articles 2 and 3 of the
African Charter.
Alleged Violation of Article 5
162. According to Article 5 of the African Charter "every individual shall have the right to the respect of the
dignity inherent in a human being and to the recognition of his legal status. All forms of exploitation and
degradation of man particularly slavery, slave trade, torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment and
treatment shall be prohibited".
163. Although the African Charter fails to provide any definition of torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment, the African Commission in its jurisprudence45 has found that the prohibition of torture, cruel,
inhuman or degrading treatment includes "actions which cause serious physical or psychological suffering
(or) humiliate the individual or force him or her to act against his or her will or conscience".
164. While it is accepted that there is no rule of international law which prescribes the circumstances under
which the death penalty may be imposed, the African Commission has cautioned that the death penalty
should only be imposed after a full consideration of not only the circumstances of the individual offence, but
also the circumstances of the individual offender.46
165. The Complainants have made reference to the fact that the adoption of hanging as a method of
executing the death penalty, and the failure of the Courts in the Respondent State to have regard to the
medical condition of Kobedi violates Article 5 of the African Charter.
166. By invoking Article 60 of the African Charter, the African Commission will rely on the jurisprudence of
the UN Human Rights Committee47 to hold that where a death sentence has been imposed, it must be
carried out in such a way as to cause the least possible physical and mental suffering. This approach was
applied in Ng v. Canada48 wherein the UN Committee found that the particular method of gas asphyxiation
amounted to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.
167. The African Commission, therefore, believes that, the carrying out of a death sentence using a
particular method of execution may amount to cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment if the
suffering caused in execution of the sentence is excessive and goes beyond that is strictly necessary.
168. The African Commission holds that under the African Charter, a parallel obligation to prevent torture or
ill-treatment derives from the undertaking given by the States Parties in Article 1 thereof "to adopt
legislative or other measures to give effect" to the rights contained in the Charter. The importance of such
safeguards has been recognized by the African Commission in the Robben Island Guidelines.49
169. The African Commission is of the view that the execution of a death sentence by hanging may not be
compatible with respect for the inherent dignity of the individual and the duty to minimize unnecessary
suffering, because it is a notoriously slow and painful means of execution. If carried out without appropriate
attention to the weight of the person condemned because hanging can result either in slow and painful
strangulation, because the neck is not immediately broken by the drop, or, at the other extreme, in the
separation of the head from the body.
170. However, the Complainants have not demonstrated that the execution would be, or was, carried out
without due attention to the weight of the condemned. In the circumstance, the African Commission holds
that these submissions are speculative and cannot in the circumstance violate Article 5 of the African
Charter. It is for this reason that the African Commission finds that there has been no violation of Article 5
of the African Charter in this regard.
171. It was also contended by the Complainants that because the victim had been under the fear of the
death penalty for over a decade since he was first arrested, this prolonged delay constitute cruel, unusual
or degrading punishment or treatment for the reason that he lived for an unconscionable amount of time
awaiting the potential imposition of a death sentence, rendering the victim's execution a violation of Article
5 of the African Charter.
172. Whilst the above definition is useful, it fails to outline those categories of actions that would constitute
a violation under Article 5 of the African Charter. To resolve this issue, the African Commission will in terms
of Article 60 of the African Charter rely on the jurisprudence of the Human Rights Committee which has
over the years, made a determination on whether the length of detention on death row amounted to a
violation of the prohibition against 'torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment'.50 In
Randolph Barrett and Clyde (sic!) v. Jamaica,51 the Human Rights Committee held that in the review of
16

criminal convictions and sentences, an element of delay between the lawful imposition of a sentence of
death and the exhaustion of available remedies is inherent in the review of the sentence; thus, even
prolonged periods of detention under a severe custodial regime on death row cannot generally be
considered to constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment if the convicted person is merely availing
himself of appellate remedies.
173. The African Commission is of the view that the computation of time as far as the delays in executing
the sentence is concern, will only start to run from the time the High Court passed the death sentence and
not from when the victim was first arrested in 1993. The evidence before the African Commission indicates
that the ensuing delay in carrying out the death sentence was because the victim had petitioned the Court
of Appeal. The victim was partly responsible for these delays and was exercising his rights to appeal. For
this reasons the African Commission finds that there is no violation of Article 5 in this regard.
174. It was submitted by the Complainants that failure to publish the unsuccessful outcome of the clemency
petition and failure to give notice of the date and time of execution amounts to cruel, inhuman and
degrading punishment and treatment in breach of Article 5 of the African Charter as thus, depriving the
convict and his family members of the important opportunity to have closure with the dignity of their last
farewells.
175. The Respondent State, failed to challenge the allegation that no reasonable notice or any notice at all
was given of the date and time of execution of the victim. The African Commission has in many of its
decisions52 held that facts uncontested by the Respondent State shall be considered as established. In
view of the foregoing, the African Commission will therefore hold this fact as established.
176. In Communication 240/01 Interights et al. (on behalf of Bosch) v. Botswana53 , the African
Commission observed that a justice system must have a human face in matters of execution of death
sentences by affording a condemned person an opportunity to arrange his affairs, to be visited by members
of his intimate family before he dies, and to receive spiritual advice and comfort to enable him to compose
himself, as best as he can, to face his ultimate ordeal.
177. The African Commission is, therefore, inclined to hold the fact that the victim and his family members
were never given the important opportunity to have closure with the dignity of their last farewells as
inhuman treatment. Since the Respondent State did not give any justifications, the African Commission
finds that the failure to give notice of the date and time of execution of the victim amounts to cruel, inhuman
and degrading punishment and treatment and therefore a violation of Article 5 of the African Charter.
Alleged Violation of Article 7
178. The Complainants contend that the fair trial rights of the victim were violated in that; (a) the Court of
Appeal misdirected itself by wrongfully invoking the doctrine of functus officio and refusing to order a retrial
in Kobedi's case in the face of strong, compelling and new contrary expert reports and instead relied on the
testimony of an unqualified forensic expert; (b) the right to counsel was not fully respected; (c) there were
inordinate delays in the trial process; (d) the Court placed a higher standard of proof - beyond reasonable
doubts on the victim .
179. From the arguments and analysis of both the Complainants and the Respondent State, the essential
question that must be asked here is whether the trial of the Kobedi complied with the provisions of Article 7
of the African Charter.
180. Article 7 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights provides that: "Every individual shall
have the right to have his cause heard. This comprises:
1. The right to an appeal to competent national organs against acts violating his fundamental rights as
recognized and guaranteed by the conventions, laws, regulations, and customs in force;
2. The right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty by a competent court or tribunal;
3. The right to defence, including the right to be defended by counsel of his choice;
4. The right to be tried within a reasonable time by an impartial court or tribunal.
