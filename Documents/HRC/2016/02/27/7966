<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Special procedures are mandated by the Human Rights Council to report to it on 
their activities (see Appendix).   
</p>
<p>2.  In 2009, the sixteenth annual meeting of special procedures mandate holders decided 
that a joint communications report would be prepared (cf. A/HRC/12/47, para 24-26), with 
this decision being reconfirmed by the seventeenth annual meeting of special procedures in 
2010 in order to avoid duplication, rationalize documentations, allow examination of cross 
cutting issues and ensure that the content of communications and any follow-up would feed 
into the universal periodic review mechanism more effectively. Mandate holders decided 
that the report should contain summaries of communications, and statistical information 
(A/HRC/15/44, para. 26-27).  
</p>
<p>3. The Outcome of the review of the work and functioning of the Human Rights 
Council calls on the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to maintain 
information on special procedures in a comprehensive and easily accessible manner, and 
encourages the use of modern information technology to reduce the circulation of paper 
(A/HRC/RES/16/21, Annex, para. 29 and 60).  
</p>
<p>4. Short summaries of allegations communicated to the respective State or other entity 
are included in the report, and the communications sent and responses received are 
accessible electronically through hyperlinks. Communications are reproduced in the 
language in which they were sent.  Replies received in Arabic, Chinese or Russian are 
included with translations into English, where available.  
</p>
<p>5. This report covers all urgent appeals, letters of allegations and other letters sent by 
special procedures mandate holders between 1 June and 30 November 2012 and all replies 
received between 1 August 2012 and 31 January 2013. Communications sent before 1 June 
2012 are reported in A/HRC/21/49, A/HRC/20/30, A/HRC/19/44 and A/HRC/18/51 
respectively. 
</p>
<p>6. The report also includes replies received between 1 August 2012 and 31 January 
2013, relating to communications sent by special procedures mandate holders before 1 June 
</p><p>2012. Some of these replies supplement information communicated earlier by the 
respective State.   
</p>
<p>7. The present report contains urgent appeals sent by the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention and the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances and joint 
urgent appeals sent by them together with other mandates.  It does not contain other types 
of communications issued by these mandates, which are processed according to their own 
distinctive procedures, and are reported in the annual reports of these two working groups. 
</p>
<p>8. The names of some alleged victims have been obscured in order to protect their 
privacy and prevent further victimization. Names of victims who would otherwise have 
their identities protected are mentioned only when the concerned individual has expressly 
consented or requested to have his or her name in the public report. In the original 
communications, the full names of the alleged victims were provided to the Government 
concerned. Names of alleged perpetrators have systematically been darkened in State 
replies to preserve the presumption of innocence. 
</p>
<p>9. In preparing the statistics included in this report, uniform reporting periods have 
been used, reflecting all communications sent between 1 June and 30 November 2012, and 
responses received in relation to these communications up to 31 January 2013. </p>

<p>Allegations of increased targeting of the co-chair of the Coalition for Fair and 
Free Elections (Bersih), and other Bersish members, by non-State and State 
actors. According to the information received, on 19 May 2012, Ms. Ambiga 
Sreenevasan had to cancel her participation in a public event amidst fear for 
her safety due to hostile acts by members of a right wing party. Over the 
following few days, she received memorandums from two groups which 
accused her of being an enemy and traitor of the State, and stating that she 
should be expelled from the country. On 23 May, the federal Government 
announced that it would sue Ms. Sreenevasan, together with other Bersih 
organizers, for damage which allegedly occurred during the Bersih 3.0 rally 
of 28 April 2012.

<p>Alleged forced eviction of approximately 1,000 Roma residents (240 families) 
from the Belvil settlement in Belgrade.  According to the information 
received, on 26 April 2012, approximately 1,000 people, mainly Roma (240 
families) were evicted from the informal Belvil settlement in Belgrade. The 
evicted persons were relocated on the same day to four relocation settlements 
in Belgrade and six municipalities outside Belgrade. Allegedly consultations 
with and information provided to the affected community prior to the eviction 
were inadequate, prior notice was not adequately given, and housing solutions 
offered to the evictees did not conform to international standards. While it 
would seem that those housing solutions are temporary, reportedly no 
information had been given to the affected community regarding durable 
alternative housing/resettlement solutions. The potential eviction of the above 
mentioned community was the subject of a previous communication sent on 3 
May 2010 (see A/HRC/16/42/Add.1, para 60).

<p>Alleged arrest and risk of expulsion of human rights defender. According to 
the information received, Mr. Ahmed Abdul Khaleq was sentenced in 
November 2011 to two years&#8216; imprisonment in connection with reported 
</p>
<p>online comments calling for political reform, before being pardoned the next 
day. Mr. Khaleq is a stateless person of Emirati origin who resides in Ajman 
in the United Arab Emirates. On 21 May 2012, Mr. Khaleq and his family 
were granted Comorian citizenship after allegedly being pressured to apply 
for it by authorities in the United Arab Emirates. On 22 May, Mr. Khaleq was 
detained by authorities in the Immigration Department. Since that time, it is 
reported that Mr. Khaleq&#8216;s only contact with his family was one phone call in 
</p>
<p>which he informed them that he was being transferred to Al Wathba Jail. It is

<p>Alleged sentencing to death by stoning for adultery. According to information 
received, on May 13 2012, the criminal court of Ombada in Khartoum, central 
Sudan, sentenced Ms. Intisar Sharif Abdallah, 20 years old and mother of 
three children, to death by stoning based on charges of adultery, under article 
146 of Sudan&#8216;s criminal code of 1991. It is reported that although she had 
</p>
<p>initially pleaded not guilty, she admitted to the charges at a later hearing, after 
reportedly being beaten by her brother. The conviction was based solely on 
this testimony.  It is reported that during the trial, Ms. Sharif Abdallah did not 
have access to a lawyer, nor an interpreter, despite the fact that she has a 
limited knowledge of Arabic, while the man co-accused of the same charges 
was simply released after denying them. Ms. Sharif Abdallah is reportedly 
being detained with her youngest son, who is four months old, while her two 
other children are in the care of her family.

<p>Alleged abduction, forced conversion and forced marriage of three Hindu

Supreme Court decision that allowed their return to their alleged kidnappers. 
According to the information received, Ms. X, Ms. Lata Kumari and Ms. Y 
were kidnapped, forcedly converted to Islam, and forced into marriage in 
early 2012. It is reported that the Supreme Court intervened in these cases 
and,  on 18 April 2012, ordered that the women be allowed to decide whether 
they wished to remain with their husbands. They agreed to do so. It is alleged 
that the Court did not take into consideration the violent nature of the 
abduction, and the climate of fear and intimidation faced by these women and 
their families, when requesting them to take the decision. After the Supreme 
Court hearings, Messrs. Khursheed Khokhar and Pitamber Sewani, criticized 
this decision and later received death threats for defending minority rights in 
the country.

Alleged mistreatment with electric shocks of children and young adults 
enrolled in the residential programme of the Judge Rotenberg Center (JRC) in 
Canton, Massachusetts. According to the information received, the JRC 
continues to supplement its educational programme with a type of therapy 
known as &quot;aversive therapy&quot;, which includes electric shocks and physical 
restraint as measures to punish students and encourage change in behavior. It 
is reported that those measures are not only used in cases of self-destructive 
behaviour and life threatening situations but that students are shocked for very 
minor things, up to 30 times a day. On 10 April 2012, a video surfaced in the 
public domain of a JRC student, tied face down and being shocked 31 times 
over a seven hour period, apparently supporting these allegations. As result of 
this treatment, he was reportedly hospitalized for several weeks and suffered 
permanent psychological damage.

<p>Alleged imminent deportation of Jehovah&#8216;s Witnesses from Uzbekistan. 
According to the information received, Ms. Elena Tsyngalova and her two 
minor children were scheduled for deportation to Russia on Tuesday, 12 June 
</p><p>2012. On 5 September 2011, Ms. Tsyngalova was allegedly convicted for 
sharing her religious views as a Jehovah's Witness with an interested person. 
She was fined &quot;50 times&quot; the minimum wage. It was reported that on 6 
September 2011, the police searched Ms. Tsyngalova's apartment and seized 
religious literature regarding the Jehovah's Witnesses. She was again 
convicted and fined another &quot;50 times&quot; the minimum salary for possessing 
this religious literature. In early June 2012, she was allegedly summoned by 
the migration police who told her that she was to be deported on 12 June 
2012. To her knowledge, there has been no court hearing or any court 
decision ordering her deportation. The migration police told Ms. Tsyngalova 
that due to her alleged violation of Uzbek law by her &quot;illegal religious 
activity&quot;, they were revoking her residence permit and ordering her 
deportation.

Mr. X&#8216;s apartment and took Mr. X and his pregnant wife to the Osh Oblast 
</p>
<p>Interior Department. It is reported that Mr. X was beaten by ten operative-
investigative officers. Mr. X had reportedly signed a testimony and was 
instructed to give the same account at the trial. Neither Mr. X&#8216;s lawyer nor his

Bureau established that the bodily injuries correspond to the allegations and 
could have been caused by beating. On 14 April 2012, the Osh Oblast

the law introduced amendments to the Code on Administrative Violations and 
to the Federal Law on Assemblies, Meetings, Demonstrations, Processions 
and Picketing which significantly increased the fines for violating national 
legislation on holding public events and placed additional restrictions for 
anyone willing to express dissent through peaceful protest.

<p>Alleged denial of entry to the Republic of Korea of Philippines national,

May 2012, Mr. Michel Catuira, former President of the Seoul-Gyenggi-
Incheon Migrants Trade Union (MTU), despite holding a current and valid G-
1 Visa, was denied re-entry into  the Republic of Korea at Incheon Airport, 
and deported to the Philippines. He has reportedly also experienced a number 
of legal problems regarding his work permit. As former president of the 
MTU, Mr. Catuira has been critical of the Government of Korea&#8216;s treatment 
</p>
<p>of migrant workers, a key organizer of protests against the government, and 
vocally critical of the impact of the Employment Permit System on migrant 
workers.  Reportedly, the Republic of Korea has arrested and deported several 
MTU leaders, and Mr. Catuira&#8216;s deportation may be an indication of a 
targeted crackdown on the work and activities of the MTU.

information received, Mr. Samuel Villegas Lopez was convicted and 
sentenced to death for the murder of a 59-year-old woman in Phoenix, 
Arizona. It is reported that at his first trial in 1987, Mr. Lopez was represented 
by a court appointed lawyer who had no prior experience on death penalty 
cases. Due to a legal error relating to one of the aggravating factors found by 
the judge, the death sentence was overturned. At his re-sentencing in 1990, 
the defendant was represented by another court appointed lawyer who did not 
vet his client&#8216;s background. Subsequently, he was again sentenced to death. 
</p>
<p>The execution was scheduled for 27 June 2012. Mr. Lopez was seeking 
executive clemency at the time the communication was sent.

<p>Alleged imminent forced eviction of approximately 350 Roma people from 
the Tor de&#8216; Cenci camp in Rome. According to information received, over 
</p>
<p>350 people of Roma ethnicity are facing eviction from the Tor de&#8216; Cenci 
</p>
<p>camp in Rome, where they have been living for up to 16 years. The camp was 
opened by local authorities in 1995 in an area offering adequate services to 
residents. Authorities planned to complete the eviction by 10 July 2012 and to 
resettle the Roma families in a new camp called La Barbuta, located in an 
isolated area next to Ciampino airport. Reportedly local authorities plan to use 
the camp exclusively to house Roma families currently living in different 
camps in Rome. Consultations with the Roma residents were reportedly 
inadequate and no alternative options to relocation to La Barbuta camp were 
ever discussed. Furthermore, La Barbuta camp was built in 2011 using special 
powers granted under the so-called &#8213;Nomad Emergency&#8214;, which was ruled 
unlawful by the Council of State in November 2011.

<p>Alleged negative impacts on human rights of affected communities of a 
proposed Bangladesh domestic policy permitting the construction of an open-
pit coal mine in the township of Phulbari. Concerns transmitted to GCM 
Resources plc, which through its subsidiary Asia Energy Corporation 
(Bangladesh) Pty Ltd works under a contract with the Government of 
Bangladesh on the Phulbari Coal Mine project. According to information 
received, the open-pit coal mine in Phulbari, if constructed, would have a 
significant impact on food production and its access by destroying 
approximately 12,000 acres of productive agricultural land, and on water 
access by lowering the water table 12 to 25 metres and potentially poisoning 
water sources. The proposed mine would allegedly displace up to 220,000 
people over time, 50,000 of whom are indigenous peoples belonging 23 
different tribal groups. Current plans reportedly do not provide adequate 
compensation or resettlement, and have not included consultations with 
affected communities. Finally, allegations have been raised concerning 
continued efforts to stop human rights defenders from protesting the Phulbari 
coal mine and the resulting infringements on their rights to freedom of 
expression and peaceful assembly.

<p>Allegations of excessive use of force during peaceful protests and of torture 
and ill-treatment of detainees. According to the information received, several 
protests have been taking place in Sudan since 16 June 2012. It is reported 
that on many occasions, police and security forces used teargas, rubber bullets 
and batons to disperse the peaceful protesters. Furthermore, pro-government 
students have allegedly co-operated with police to use excessive force on 
protestors and carry out arrests. Several protesters including leaders of the 
demonstrations have reportedly been arrested and some have been threatened 
with rape, while others have been subjected to violence. It is reported that 
those protestors in detention are at risk of torture and illtreatment, including 
Ms. Rashida Shams al-Din, who was reportedly arrested on 24 June and

<p>Allegation that the adoption of a draft Law on Introducing Amendments to 
Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation in Part Regulating Activities of 
Non-commercial Organizations which Carry Functions of Foreign Agents, 
may unduly restrict the right to freedom of association. According to the 
information received, on 29 June 2012, a group of Members of Parliament 
from the United Russia party submitted the draft law to the State Duma which 
contained amendments to a number of federal laws, including the Law on 
Public Associations, the Law on Non-commercial Organizations, the Law on 
Counteracting Legalization of Incomes received in a Criminal Way and 
against the Financing Terrorism, and the Code of Administrative Penalties, 
the Criminal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure and which may 
negatively affect the right to freedom of association.

stateless person of Emirati origin who resides in the United Arab Emirates, 
applied for Comorian citizenship on behalf of his family in early 2012 after

Khaleq was summoned to the Department of Immigration of the Ajman 
Emirate where he was allegedly immediately arrested without the presentation 
of an arrest warrant. He was detained in Al Sader prison. In early June 2012, 
Mr. Abdul Khaleq was reportedly asked by authorities to choose between five 
countries to be expelled to in light of the fact that Comoros do not accept 
persons of &#8215;economic citizenship&#8216;. According to reports, Mr. Abdul Khaleq 
was to be expelled from the United Arab Emirates to Thailand on Monday 16 
July 2012. Mr. Abdul Khaleq was the subject of previous communications

Alleged killings of civilians during a military operation. According to the 
information received, on 11 May 2012, in a region called Mosquitia in 
Honduras, a military operation supported by four helicopters and two aircraft, 
carrying Honduran agents and Drug Enforcement Administration officials 
from the United States of America, intercepted a boat in which a group of 
civilians was traveling on the Patuca river in the Ahuas community 
(Department of Gracias a Dios). One of the helicopters opened fire on the 
boat which led to the death of four people: Ms. Candelaria Pratt Nelson; Mr. 
Emerson Mart&#237;nez Henriquez; Ms. Juana Jackson Ambrocio; and a minor 
aged 14, and four others were wounded:  Mr. Lucio Ad&#225;n Nelson Queen; Ms. 
Hilda Rosa Lezama Kenreth; Mr. Mela&#241;o Olopio; and a minor aged 14. These 
facts are framed in the context of the anti-drug cooperation program that the 
Government of the United States of America supports together with the 
Government of Honduras.

<p>Alleged seven-year incommunicado detention and violation of the right to 
freedom of religion. According to the information received, Patriarch Abune 
Antonios of the Eritrean Orthodox Tewhado Church was put under house 
arrest in January 2006 for refusing to excommunicate 3,000 members of the 
Medhane Alem Sunday School movement and calling for the release of other 
imprisoned Christians. On 27 May 2007, Patriarch Antonios was forcibly 
removed from his residence and taken to an undisclosed location. He has 
since then been detained incommunicado. Patriarch Antonios, who is 85 years 
old, has allegedly been denied medical assistance for his severe diabetes and 
deteriorating health. Patriarch Antonios has also been allegedly denied access 
to religious support and has not been able to celebrate the Holy Eucharist and 
observe special feast days. This case was the subject of an earlier 
communication (see A/HRC/7/10/Add.1, para 91).

<p>Alleged human rights implications of proposed regulations which would 
require the deportation of pregnant migrant workers from Thailand to give 
birth in their home country. According to the information received, the 
Minister of Labour has proposed to introduce a regulation to deport pregnant 
migrant workers from Thailand. A working group under the Labour 
Ministry&#8216;s Department of Labour Protection and Welfare has two months to 
</p>
<p>draft regulations for the implementation of this proposal. Reportedly, many 
pregnant workers are uncertain about their ability to reclaim their jobs upon 
returning to Thailand, and are concerned about the possibility of additional 
expenses incurred related to travel and recruitment fees.  It is also feared that 
pregnant migrant women may seek unsafe abortions as their only option to 
stay employed, exposing them to serious health risks, including risk of death.

<p>According to information received, in the settlement of Bairro de Santa

under the threat of imminent eviction without having been provided with 
adequate alternative housing options. The inhabitants were notified of 
demolitions starting 17 July 2012, and others were scheduled for 19 and 25 
July. Furthermore inhabitants were notified by the Municipal Council that 
they must leave their homes before the end of the month with no indication of 
a specific date. Half the families have been living in the neighbourhood for 
over ten years and several families have been living in the settlement for two 
to three decades. Rehousing alternatives proposed by the Municipal Council &#8211;
either alternative housing for a selected number of families or social security 
support for a short period to rent elsewhere - are allegedly inadequate and 
unacceptable to the inhabitants. Inhabitants were allegedly notified that the 
demolition would happen with or without their cooperation and with police 
intervention if necessary.

Director of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR), President of the 
Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR) and Deputy Secretary General of the 
International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), was forcibly arrested at

imprisonment on charges of alleged libeling of the residents of the town of Al 
Muharraq through comments posted on his Twitter account on 2 June 2012. It 
is reported that his detention may be related to his comments and statements 
expressed through Twitter, in which he was criticizing the Prime Minister of 
Bahrain who was visiting the town of Muharraq, and that the libel case 
against Mr. Nabeel Rajab was allegedly filed in the name of Muharraq 
residents by persons who are part of or affiliated with the Government.

<p>Alleged forced eviction of up to 20,000 residents of the Abonnema Wharf 
Community in Port Harcourt. According to the information received, from 27 
June to 2 July 2012, an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 residents of the Abonnema 
Wharf Community in Port Harcourt, capital of Rivers State, were evicted and 
their homes destroyed. Allegedly the Rivers State authorities declared that the 
eviction was carried out in order to reduce criminal gang activity in the area. 
Reportedly, the demolitions were carried out in bad weather and thousands of 
people were left homeless as most residents were not offered any 
compensation or alternative housing. Allegedly, a negotiation process to offer 
compensation to landlords was far from being completed when the eviction 
took place and an interim injunction order issued on 11 November 2011 by 
the Rivers State High Court had called upon the Rivers State authorities not to 
carry out demolitions and evictions in Abonnema Wharf pending a full 
hearing of the case.

Soonthorn Boonyord were reportedly charged under sections 215 and 216 of

<p>Alleged revoking of human rights defender&#8216;s passport and risk of detention 
upon his planned return to Malaysia. According to the information received, 
Mr. P. Waytha Moorthy has been living in exile in the United Kingdom since 
9 September 2008, when he was granted political asylum after the Malaysian 
authorities reportedly revoked his passport. Mr. P. Waytha Moorthy is a 
lawyer and chairperson of Hindu Rights Action Force (HINDRAF), an 
organization working to promote human rights in Malaysia, and in particular, 
to defend the rights of the Malaysian Indian minority. Following a mass rally 
organized by HINDRAF in November 2007 to protest against the human 
rights violations of minority Indians, several members of HINDRAF were 
allegedly arrested and detained under the Internal Security Act. The alleged 
arrest of family members of HINDRAF lawyers, including Ms P. 
Vwaishhnnavi, daughter of Mr. P. Waytha Moorthy, and the decision to 
declare HINDRAF illegal, were the subject of a previous communication (see 
A/HRC/10/12/Add.1 para 1640). The alleged harassment and arrest of 
members of HINDRAF was also the subject of a previous communication 
(see A/HRC/18/51, MYS 5/2011).

<p>Alleged detention and torture at the Police Temporary Detention Isolator 
(TDI) in the Kvareli District of Georgia. According to the information 
received, on 28 May 2012, Mr. Irakli Beraia, a member of the Youth 
Movement &#8213;November 7&#8214; was detained during a peaceful protest outside of 
</p>
<p>the Georgian Parliament Building in Tbilisi. Despite the fact that his trial took 
place in Tbilisi, he was transported to the Kvareli District for detention in the 
Temporary Detention Isolator (TDI) over 140 kilometres from the location of 
his trial.  It is alleged that for the first three days of his detention, before being 
given access to his lawyer, Mr. Beraira was subjected to beatings; denied 
adequate food, clean water, or sanitation; and had swarms of locusts placed in 
his cell by prison guards. It is also alleged that communications with his 
family were denied. Finally, it is alleged that the prosecutor&#8216;s office failed to 
</p>
<p>exercise its duty to investigate these charges once they became public in a 
press conference held on 29 June 2012.

<p>Allegation that a draft decree on &#8213;management, provision and use of internet

contains provisions which would run contrary to the right to freedom of

purposes, dealing with the responsibility of Internet service providers and 
other intermediaries, and requiring that Internet service providers should filter 
information. In addition, the draft decree would require Internet users to use 
their real name when posting information.

Alleged forced eviction and demolition of an informal settlement in Lagos. 
According to the information received, on 16 July 2012, the Lagos State 
government commenced the demolition of the Makoko Waterfront following 
an open 72 hour quit notice, dated 12 July 2012, issued to some residents by 
the Ministry of Waterfront Infrastructure Development. Between 16 and 21 
July the Lagos State demolition squad, backed by heavily armed policemen, 
reportedly destroyed the homes and properties of Makoko residents. 
Excessive force used by the Police allegedly caused the death of one resident, 
Timothy Azinkpono. At the time the communication was sent, over 30,000 
residents, including women, children, and the elderly had allegedly lost their 
homes; over 120,000 people faced imminent displacement. Evictees were 
allegedly further endangered as many of them were then forced to live and 
sleep in their canoes. Reportedly, three children of one family drowned when 
their canoe capsized as they were sleeping during the night of 18 July. 
According to statements by public officials, the Lagos State government was 
not planning on any compensation or resettlement as the people concerned are 
not from Lagos.

security forces broke up peaceful demonstrations held in the Wad Nubawi 
neighborhood of Omdurman, a suburb of Khartoum, and in front of national 
security headquarters in central Khartoum. On 31 July, the Sudanese police 
and NISS fired live ammunition and tear gas on protesters in Nyala, South 
Darfur. Reportedly, twelve individuals, including at least five individuals 
under 18, who participated in the protest, died from gun shots, while several 
tens were wounded by sharp weapons. Additionally, mass arrests of peaceful 
protestors and human rights defenders have taken place. Mr. Mohammed 
Salah Mohammed was arrested on 24 June 2012 for having participated in a 
peaceful protest at the University of Khartoum, and  subjected to torture and 
ill treatment in detention. It is also reported that Ms. Rashida Shams al-Din,

Alleged imposition of the death penalty on an individual with intellectual 
disabilities &#8211; According to the information received, Mr. Marvin Wilson, a 
54-year-old American, was convicted of murder and sentenced to death in 
</p><p>1994. In 1997, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals overturned his 
conviction. The following year, he was retried and sentenced to death. In 
2003, the defendant&#8216;s lawyers challenged their client&#8216;s death sentence on the 
claim that he had intellectual disabilities. In 2004, a court-appointed 
neuropsychologist concluded that Mr. Wilson had intellectual disabilities. In 
November 2004, despite the mental health expert&#8216;s diagnosis, the District 
Court for the Eastern District of Texas rejected the claim. In 2011, the United 
States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the death sentence. Mr. 
Wilson was scheduled to be executed on 7 August 2012. His lawyers filed a 
petition for a writ of Certiorari to the United States Supreme Court.

<p>Alleged attacks on the Ahmadiyah place of worship and followers by the 
Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) in Singaparna and Batam. According to the 
information received, on 20 April 2012, FPI members attacked Baitul Rahim 
mosque in Singaparna, West Java after the FPI leader delivered a speech at 
the mosque asserting that it should be closed down. Some mosque properties 
were reportedly destroyed.  Before and during the attack, the police was 
allegedly present but did not take any measures to prevent it. On 27 April 
2012 in Batam, the FPI members went to the Ruko Nagoya, an Ahmadiyah 
religious place, and took away all the books, Qurans and pictures of the fourth 
Ahmadiyah&#8216;s Khalifah; and allegedly assaulted Mubaligh Nasrun, the 
</p>
<p>Ahmadiyah leader in that location. Reportedly, the FPI members took Mr. 
Nasrun and two other Ahmadiyah members, Messrs. Suwadi and Arief, to the 
Barelang District Police Station demanding the police to detain three of them, 
close down Ruko Nagoya or make them denounce their faith.

<p>Alleged imposition of the death penalty on an individual for drugs offence. 
According to the information received, in June 2012, Mr Saeed Sedeghi was 
sentenced to death for his participation in the purchase and possession of 512 
kilograms of methamphetamine. In July 2012 Mr. Sedeghi was brought before 
Branch 10 of Tehran&#8216;s Revolutionary Court, where he was reportedly 
</p>
<p>required to sign a document, apparently informing him that his death sentence 
was going to be implemented. Moreover, Mr. Sedeghi had previously made 
an application to the Amnesty and Clemency Commission and he was never 
formally told of the outcome of this communication. On 1 August 2012, he 
was transferred from Soroush 111, also known as Tehran&#8216;s Kahrizak 
</p>
<p>detention centre, to Ghezel Hesar Prison in Karaj. It is reported that he could 
be executed at any time in this centre. Mr. Saeed was the subject of a previous 
communication (see above, IRN 15/2012).

Follow-up to two earlier communications concerning legislation which 
discriminates against migrants. A letter was sent by the Special Rapporteur on 
16 September 2011, inter alia requesting information on measures taken to 
ensure that legislation at state and federal level ensures the protection of the 
human rights of migrants. Another letter was sent by the Special Rapporteur, 
jointly with two other mandates (racism and minorities) on 24 April 2012, 
concerning the Alabama Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act, which targets 
immigrants and people perceived to be immigrants, including persons of 
Hispanic origin, for harassment, intimidation, and punitive sanctions in the 
state of Alabama. The Special Rapporteur regretted the lack of response to 
these two letters. Furthermore, he requested information concerning the so-
called &#8213;administrative DREAM Act&#8214;, as well as on the impact of the Supreme 
</p>

<p>Alleged systematic undermining of the autonomous functions and the rights to 
freedom of religion, culture and expression of the Tibetan Buddhist 
community. According to the information received, new management policies 
of the monasteries and patriotic re-education or legal education campaigns in 
the Tibet Autonomous Region have led to the closure of monasteries and the 
violation of freedom of religion or belief. Tibetans are allegedly restrained 
from observing certain religious holidays or celebrations. Furthermore, there 
have reportedly been 46 cases of self-immolation since 2009; about 600 
Tibetans were detained after the first incident of self-immolation in Lhasa 
while several hundreds of Tibetans were expelled from Lhasa. There were 
also reports of the arrests of Tibetan pilgrims who attended a ten-day teaching 
- the Kalachakra Initiation- given by the Dalai Lama in India. As many as 64 
Tibetan intellectuals, including artists, writers, singers and teachers were 
allegedly arrested for exercising their right to freedom of expression and 
participation in cultural life especially after March 2008.  Allegedly, the 
whereabouts of 37 of the detained intellectuals, including artists, are 
unknown.

<p>Alleged detention and trial of human rights defender.  According to the 
information received, in July 2012, Mr. Cemal Bektas, president of Yakay-
der, an organization which works to clarify the circumstances of enforced 
disappearances and extrajudicial executions in Turkey, was accused of 
belonging to an armed organization under article 314/2 of the Turkish 
Criminal Code. He is also reportedly accused of illegal activities within the 
context of the inquiry against the Koma Civaken Kurdistan (KCK &#8211; Union of 
Communities in Kurdistan).. There was allegedly a lack of procedural 
safeguards during Mr. Bektas&#8216; initial trial from 2-13 July 2012. From 1 to 9 
October 2012, another hearing was allegedly scheduled to take place for Mr. 
Bektas who reportedly remained in detention. Mr. Bektas was the subject of 
an earlier communication (see A/HRC/16/44, p. 129).

Alleged negative human rights impacts stemming from the privatization of 
Burundi&#8216;s coffee industry, particularly in relation to the right to food. 
</p>
<p>According to the information received, the World Bank has been the driving 
force behind the privatization process, making its budget support to the 
Government and receipt of foreign aid conditional upon the privatization of 
the coffee industry and playing a key role in defining the conditions for 
privatization. As the majority of the population receives its income from the 
coffee industry, changes in wages and payments for coffee and coffee 
processing can have significant impacts on the ability of the population to 
purchase food and meet their food needs. Reportedly, no study has been 
conducted into how privatization will affect the ability of local populations to 
access food.

<p>Allegations of disruption by law enforcement officials of a human rights 
training course undertaken by two non-government organizations, and threats 
against its members. According to the information received, on 27 July 2012, 
law enforcement officials, allegedly acting upon instruction of provincial 
authorities, interrupted a training course on land issues organized by Mr. Pen 
Bonnar from the Cambodian Human Rights and Development Association 
(ADHOC) and Mr. Chim Savuth from the Cambodian Center for Human 
Rights (CCHR) in Patang village, Rattanakiri province. The reason put 
forward by the authorities was that the organizers had allegedly failed to 
notify the authorities that they would be holding the training session, although 
they were not obliged to do so in line with article 3 of the domestic law on 
demonstrations. Law enforcement officials further accused ADHOC of 
undertaking &#8213;incitement activities&#8214;, and warned Messrs. Pen Bonnar and 
</p>
<p>Chim Savuth to leave the area, otherwise their security would not be 
guaranteed. As a result, both men ended the training session in for their safety 
and the safety of the participants.

<p>Alleged upholding of sentence of life imprisonment of human rights defender 
by the Supreme Court. According to information received, on 20 December 
2011, the Supreme Court issued its decision upholding the sentence of life 
imprisonment against Mr. Azimjan Askarov on charges of organizing mass 
disorder, inciting inter-ethnic hatred, hostage-taking and incitement to 
murder. On 26 January 2011, a review of his case and that of seven co-
defendants had been commenced by the Supreme Court following the verdict 
of guilty by the Court of Appeal in November 2010. The Supreme Court had 
in February 2012 agreed to decide on Mr. Askarov&#8216;s case separately. Serious 
concerns were raised regarding Mr. Askarov&#8216;s right to a fair trial during the 
</p>
<p>first and second instance trials and it is alleged that these were not adequately 
addressed in the Supreme Court&#8216;s decision.  Mr. Askarov was the subject of 
</p>
<p>previous communications (see A/HRC/16/44/Add.1, para 1422, 1449 &amp;1465 
and A/HRC/18/51, case no KGZ 1/2011).

<p>Alleged torture by detention personnel and refusal to meet with family or

received, Mr. Souvanh is a human rights defender who was arrested on 18 
June 2012. He is a farmer who had been active in advocating for land rights in 
his local community. The group of human rights defenders was protesting a 
land concession given by the local government for which the farmers 
demanded proper compensation. The arrest followed complaints and a 
petition sent by the farmers to various governmental agencies. During his 
fourteen day detention, Mr. Souvanh was allegedly bound by his arms and 
legs and repeatedly beaten while receiving only eight meals. Furthermore, he 
was not allowed to meet with his relatives or lawyer and was denied any legal 
assistance. Mr. Souvanh was reportedly also forced to sign a declaration to 
renounce his rights and to abstain from further action.

<p>Alleged hostage taking, abuse and exploitation of migrants by traffickers in 
Sinai. According to the information received, the migrants were held captive 
by the traffickers and required to pay a large sum of money as a condition of 
release and journey to Israel.  They were reportedly subject to torture, 
physical and sexual violence, forced labour and/or deprivation of food and 
water, if they were unable to pay the ransom.  The Egyptian authorities 
allegedly failed to conduct any investigation into these allegations.  This 
matter was the subject of an earlier communication in 2010 
(A/HRC/17/35/Add.1). Furthermore, it was reported that the migrants were 
shot at by the Egyptian border guards at the Israel-Egypt border as they made 
their way to Israel.  This allegation was also the subject of an earlier 
communication in 2009 (A/HRC/17/33/Add.1).

sectarian violence in the village of Dahshur. According to the information 
received, on 27 July 2012, Mr. Sameh Samy, a Coptic Christian laundryman, 
inadvertently burned the shirt of a Muslim client, Mr. Ahmad Ramadan. 
Despite the agreement by both men to settle the grievance that evening, Mr. 
Ramadan allegedly returned in the afternoon with about 3000 armed Muslims 
and surrounded Mr. Samy&#8216;s house and laundrette. As the fighting intensified, 
</p>
<p>Mr. Samy hurled a fire bomb which hit a Muslim passer-by, Mr. Moaz Hasab-
Allah who died from third degree burns on 31 July 2012. 120 families 
reportedly fled the village on the same day for fear of the revenge attacks. On 
1 August 2012, it was reported that hundreds of Muslims torched and looted 
homes and businesses of Coptic Christian community in the village, and the 
security forces present during the incident allegedly did not protect most 
Coptic properties except for the small church of St. George and some houses 
close to the church.

<p>Alleged threats against human rights defenders, including death threats and 
surveillance. According to the information received, Ms Edah Wangechi 
Maina, Vice President of the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities and Director of Kenya Society for the Mentally Handicapped 
(KSMH), began to receive anonymous death threats and threats to kidnap her 
daughter in March 2011, following a demonstration held by KSMH to protest 
against alleged violations of the rights of people with disabilities and 
corruption in the National Council of Persons with Disabilities (NCPD) and 
the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Development. It is reported that 
Mr. Prabhudas Damji Pattni, Secretary General of KSMH and the Hindu

habr&#237;an bloqueado la sede del diario La Prensa por tres horas y media con m&#225;s

en los contratos entre la empresa y el Ministerio de Obras P&#250;blicas. Seg&#250;n se

<p>Alleged torture of detained human rights defender. According to the 
information received, Mr. Ahmed El-Sayed was brought before Jeddah 
Criminal Court on 18 July on charges of drug trafficking, where his hearing 
was rescheduled until 5 September. Sources indicate that if convicted, the 
death penalty will be imposed. Mr. El-Sayed was detained on 17 April 2012 
at Jeddah Airport, following which he was allegedly tried in absentia and 
sentenced to one year imprisonment and twenty lashes for insulting the King 
of Saudi Arabia. Sources indicate that Mr. El-Sayed confessed to drug 
trafficking on 21 April 2012 while being subjected to physical and mental 
torture in Zahban Prison. Mr. El-Sayed is an Egyptian human rights lawyer 
who represents a number of Egyptian citizens who are allegedly detained 
arbitrarily in Saudi Arabia. It is reported that Mr. El-Sayed is representing 
himself but he has not been allowed access to law books to prepare his legal 
defence. Mr. Ahmed El-Sayed was the subject of an earlier communication 
(see A/HRC/21/ 49, SAU 8/2012).

<p>Alleged mass arrests, deaths in custody and enforced disappearance. 
According to the information received, on 12 and 13 August 2012, security 
forces carried out large scale raids on houses and shops and mass arrests in 
Damascus. A number of those arrested have reportedly been found dead 
following their arrest. On 13 August 2013, at around 4 p.m. at least four 
armed men wearing uniforms forcibly entered Mr. Hayel Hamid&#8216;s surgery 
</p>
<p>clinic on Yarmouk Street in Yarmouk Camp, Damascus. The men neither 
showed an arrest warrant nor explained the reason for Mr. Hamid&#8216;s arrest. 
</p>
<p>They allegedly took him to his home and searched his house. The men then 
ordered him to get into the vehicle and drove away, while some of them 
followed in their own car. Since then, his whereabouts remained unknown. 
Information received indicates that the armed men belong to the Air Force 
Intelligence.

<p>Alleged arbitrary detention, solitary confinement and extraction of evidence 
under torture. According to the information received, on 6 May 2011, Mr. 
Musab Al Abood was arrested by the Abu Dhabi security officers and 
transferred to the State security prison in Abu Dhabi where he was kept in 
solitary confinement for a period of three months. Mr. Al Abood was 
allegedly severely tortured for allegedly belonging to, or of having links, with 
illegal or terrorist organizations. Mr. Al Abood was forced to sign papers 
while blindfolded. He later denied all accusations brought against him. Mr Al 
Abood claimed at the State Security Prosecution to have signed papers while 
blindfolded, but his statement was reportedly not recorded by the investigator 
of the State Security Prosecution. In May 2012, Mr. Al-Abood was reportedly 
sentenced to three years of imprisonment based on the confession obtained 
under torture. Mr. Al-Abood has been on a hunger strike since 27 June 2012, 
to protest the court verdict. He was very weak and at risk of losing 
consciousness.

<p>Alleged torture of a 49-year old man by detention personnel. According to the 
information received, Mr. Kim Young-hwan a South Korean national was 
arrested on the charge of endangering national security on 29 March 2012. He 
is a prominent defender of human rights, focusing specifically on the 
Democratic People&#8216;s Republic of Korea, and was allegedly in China to assist 
</p>
<p>North-Korean refugees. He was detained for 114 days, during which he was 
allegedly beaten, deprived of sleep and given electric shocks by detention 
personnel. Furthermore, in order to be released, Mr. Kim Young-hwan was 
asked multiple times to sign a document admitting he had violated Chinese 
laws and promising he would not talk about the abuse he had suffered while 
in detention. He refused to do so, and was released from China on 20 July 
2012 and returned to South Korea.

Allegations concerning the possible negative impacts of the Lamu Port-South 
Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor (LAPSSET) project on indigenous 
peoples inhabiting Lamu County and surrounding areas in Kenya. According 
to the information received, the LAPSSET project is a major infrastructure 
development project that will span three countries: Kenya, South Sudan and 
Ethiopia. It will consist of a major shipping port in Lamu County, in the 
northeastern coast of Kenya, as well as the construction of a major highway, 
resort cities, airport, oil refinery and pipeline that would interconnect the three 
countries. There are reportedly serious concerns regarding the effects that the 
construction of this project would have on the traditional lands, natural 
resources, and livelihoods of indigenous peoples in Lamu County and 
surrounding areas. Nevertheless, according to the information received there 
have not been adequate consultations carried out with affected indigenous 
communities and they have received very little information about the project 
and its potential effects on their rights.

Alleged exclusion of the Mangakahia Whanau from the Treaty of Waitangi 
settlement process. According to the information received, Mangakahia 
Whanau is a Maori iwi (tribe) numbering over one thousand people whose 
ancestral territory is located in the Hauraki District. Reportedly, the New 
Zealand Government&#8216;s policy of negotiating treaty settlements with large 
</p>
<p>Maori groupings or collectives, rather than individual tribes, has resulted in 
the claims of the Mangakahia Whanau not being adequately addressed by the 
collective with whom the Government is negotiating, the Hauraki Collective. 
Furthermore, the Hauraki Collective purports to act on behalf of Mangakahia 
Whanau, without its authorization or consent. This is of special concern since 
the Hauraki Collective reportedly intends to claim reparations that would 
otherwise be due to the Mangakahia Whanau under the treaty settlement 
process.

Alleged refoulement of a Russian national, applying for asylum in Ukraine, to

for asylum to the Ukrainian government in February 2011 after charges had 
been brought against him relating to an incident that took place in Malgobek, 
in the province of Ingushetia in the Russian Federation on 28 October 2010. 
He reportedly applied for asylum because he feared persecution and torture in 
the Russian Federation. His request for asylum was rejected by the Ukrainian 
government, on the basis of which it was decided he would be extradited to 
the Russian Federation. On 7 March 2012, the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees recognized Mr. X&#8216;s refugee status. On 11 
</p>
<p>June 2012, the Finnish Immigration Service also recognized him as a refugee. 
Reportedly, Mr. X&#8216;s appeal to his extradition was rejected by the Ukrainian 
</p>
<p>government. He was scheduled to be deported to the Russian Federation on 
17 August 2012.

<p>Alleged arrest, detention and ill treatment of 44 members of Gays and

11 August 2012, the office of GALZ in Harare was raided by police.  The raid 
followed a meeting earlier that afternoon to finalize the GALZ human rights 
report and discuss a submission relating to changes to the draft Constitution. 
According to reports, the police proceeded to beat the GALZ members 
arresting the 44 individuals who were on the premises at the time and taking 
them to Harare Central Police Station where the male detainees were 
allegedly subjected to beatings throughout the night. Whilst in detention the 
GALZ members were denied access to their legal representatives.  All of 
those detained were released without charge the following morning with the 
exception of one man who was taken to hospital by the police after he 
collapsed in detention, while another man also suffered significant injuries to 
his ear and is purportedly receiving treatment.

<p>Alleged negative human rights impacts stemming from the order to ban three 
humanitarian aid organizations from supporting unregistered Rohingya 
asylum-seekers, refugees and migrants in and around unofficial camps in the 
Cox&#8216;s Bazar district in south-eastern Bangladesh. According to information 
received, M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res, Action Contre la Faim and Muslim Aid 
UK received letters on 2 August 2012 from the NGO Affairs Bureau attached 
to the Office of the Prime Minister, asking them to cease their operations in 
the Cox&#8216;s Bazar district (except in the two official camps, housing some 
</p>
<p>30,000 Rohingya, run by the Government and supported by the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other partners). It is alleged 
that the cessation of the aid organizations&#8216; activities will not only seriously 
infringe on the human rights of the unregistered Rohingya asylum-seekers, 
refugees and migrants, but also have a significant impact on the large number 
of local people in the area who regularly access the services provided by the 
non-governmental organizations.

<p>Allegation of a worrying pattern of racism, racial discrimination, and 
xenophobia against foreigners, migrants, asylum seekers and refugees.  
According to the information received, this pattern is illustrated by an 
increase in xenophobic and racist attacks, the entry for the first time into 
Parliament of the far right wing political party Golden Dawn, and the 
implementation of policy measures targeting migrants and asylum seekers in 
the area of health, including their mandatory medical testing and 
administrative detention based on health status. Allegedly, several incidents 
of racially motivated violence and attacks against foreigners, migrants, and 
asylum seekers occurred in different places across Greece. Allegedly, the 
surge in these xenophobic attacks is linked to the rise of the Golden Dawn far 
right political party. Reportedly, an amendment to the Presidential Decree 
114/2010 on the establishment of a single procedure for granting refugee 
status or subsidiary protection to aliens or to stateless persons was adopted in 
April 2012, providing for detention of migrants and asylum seekers based on 
their health status.

<p>Alleged attacks on the Shi&#8216;a Community and blasphemy charges against their 
religious leader in Sampang, Madura of East Java, Indonesia. According to 
the information received, there have been multiple attacks against the Shi&#8216;a 
</p>
<p>community, their places of worship and religious leader, Mr. Ali Murtadho 
alias Tajul Muluk, in Nangkrenang village of Sampang, East Java since 2006. 
Reportedly, On 4 April 2011, a group of people claiming themselves as Ahl 
as-sunnah wa al-Jamaah (Sunni), besieged Nangkrenang village to stop the 
celebration of Maulid of the Prophet Muhammad organized by the Shi&#8216;a 
followers at Tajul Muluk&#8216;s residence. Following another attack on 29 
</p>
<p>December 2011, about 335 villages, including at least 107 children were 
reportedly evacuated to a temporary shelter at a sports complex in Sampang. 
On 1 January 2012, the Sampang branch of the Indonesia Ulema Council 
(MUI) allegedly issued a religious decree (fatwa) declaring Tajul Muluk&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>teachings as deviant teachings. Subsequently, Tajul Muluk was tried before 
the Sampang District Court for blasphemy on 24 April 2012 and 12 July 
</p><p>2012. On 12 July 2012, the District Court disregarded the witnesses&#8216; 
</p>
<p>testimonies and concluded that Tajul Muluk&#8216;s views on the non-authenticity 
of the existing Quran have desecrated Islam, hence, sentencing him to two 
years imprisonment.

Alleged negative impact of article 9 of the draft Deep and Comprehensive 
Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA), currently being negotiated between the 
Republic of Moldova and the European Union, on access to medicines in the 
Republic of Moldova. According to the information received, article 9 of the 
draft DCFTA contains a &#8213;TRIPS-plus&#8214; provision on data exclusivity, 
according to which manufacturers of generic medicines would allegedly not 
be able to refer to clinical test results of originator drugs for a maximum 
period of eleven years with potentially negative impact on the ability of major 
segments of the population in Moldova to afford a range of medications, 
including antibiotics, antiretrovirals and medicines for the treatment of 
tuberculosis and cancer. Allegedly the provision will ensure a monopoly by 
manufacturers of originator drugs and that manufacturers of generic drugs 
will be unable to enter the market and provide cheaper alternatives to 
originator drugs for a maximum period of eleven years.

Alleged imminent demolition by the United States Army War College, of one 
of the last standing structures connected to the former Carlisle Indian 
Industrial School, a site of deep historical significance to indigenous peoples 
throughout the country. According to the information received, the Carlisle 
Indian Industrial School, established in 1879 in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, was 
the first boarding school to house Native American children outside of their 
reservation homelands. After the school closed in 1918, the premises were 
reclaimed by the U.S. Army as part of the Carlisle Barracks, however certain 
parts of the school were subsequently designated as a National Historic 
Landmark. The farmhouse was excluded from this designation, despite being 
actively used for housing and educational purposes for indigenous children.  
Recently, the U.S. Army War College, located at the Carlisle Barracks, 
announced its plans to raze the farmhouse in August or September of 2012 in 
order to make way for four new housing units for its personnel. As the 
farmhouse was not designated as a National Historic Landmark the War 
College is allegedly taking the position that does not have to consult with the 
relevant state agency, nor with interested indigenous peoples.

Alleged imminent sale of land located within the Black Hills, South Dakota, 
considered to be a site of great spiritual significance to the Lakota, Dakota 
and Nakota indigenous peoples.  According to the information received the 
site known as Pe&#8216; Sla is located on the Reynolds Prairie in the Black Hills, 
</p>
<p>which has been owned by the Reynolds family since the 1870s. Over the 
years, members of the owners of Reynolds Prairie had permitted Sioux 
peoples to enter the land and conduct their traditional ceremonies at Pe&#8216; Sla, 
</p>
<p>however recently, the family recently announced its intention to sell some 
land during a land sale auction on 25 August 2012. The Lakota, Dakota and 
Nakota indigenous peoples fear the sale may result in restrictions on future 
access to Pe&#8216; Sla. There is also concern over the state of South Dakota&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>reported intention to pave a gravel road through Pe&#8216; Sla, in order to facilitate 
logging and recreational activities in the area. Reportedly the Lakota, Dakota 
and Nakota peoples have begun a fundraising effort in order to recover this 
sacred site.

<p>Alleged death threats against human rights defender. According to the 
information received, Mr. J&#250;nior Jos&#233; Guerra was forced to relocate with his 
family in December 2011 and was temporarily accepted into the National 
Protection Programme for Human Rights Defenders following the alleged 
killing of fellow human rights defender Mr. Jo&#227;o Chupel Primo and after he 
was chased by unknown individuals. Mr. Guerra is the former chairperson of 
Conselho Fiscal da Associa&#231;&#227;o de Moradores do Plano de Assentmento Areia 
and, along with Mr. Primo, played a key role in the filing of official 
complaints against alleged illegal logging in Riozinho do Anfrisio Extractive 
Reserve and Trair&#227;o National Forest. On 24 and 28 May 2012 respectively, 
Mr. Guerra's home in the Areia Settlement of Trair&#227;o was reportedly set on 
fire and a death threat was placed on his fence following the alleged 
poisoning of his pets. Sources indicate that Mr. Guerra moved back to his 
home on 22 June in order to give testimony in the case of the alleged killing 
of Mr. Primo.

revoked. The first hearing of the case reportedly took place on 9 July, during 
which the complainant allegedly presented two witnesses who claimed that 
IDA staff members convert Muslim persons to Christianity. A decision on 
whether the accused will be charged with blasphemy would reportedly be 
made on 27 August. Sources indicate that if convicted, the four accused face a 
sentence of life imprisonment or the death penalty.

terrorism-related charges. According to the information received, Mr. Saleh 
Musa Ahmed Mohammed Al Baydani, a Yemeni citizen detained in Iraq, is at 
risk of imminent execution in Iraq. Following a trial in 2011 that allegedly did 
not comply with international human rights law provisions of due process and 
fair trial, he was sentenced to death under the charge of association with a 
terrorist group, which is not considered as most serious crime under 
international law. Moreover, Mr. Al Baydani was reportedly a minor at the

<p>Alleged arrest, detention and sentencing of human rights defender. According 
to the information received, on 15 July 2012, Mr. Mam Sonando was arrested 
by police at his home in Phnom Penh.  The warrant for his arrest was 
apparently issued while he was out of the country and on 16 July he was 
formally charged in accordance with six articles from the Penal Code 
including &#8213;insurrection&#8214; and &#8213;inciting people to take up arms against the

<p>Allegations of lack of procedural safeguards in the case against the 
Association of Young Lawyers of Tajikistan (Amparo). According to the 
information received, on 28 June 2012 the Department of Justice of the Sughd 
Province launched an audit into the Association of Young Lawyers of 
Tajikistan (Amparo) for suspicion of illicit activity. A day later, on 29 June, 
the association received notification of a law suit against the association for 
allegedly violating several provisions of the Law on Public Associations. It is 
reported that the Department of Justice of the Sughd Province solicited the 
regional court of Sughd to dissolve the association. According to reports 
received, there were significant irregularities in the auditing of the 
association. On 6 August 2012, the association received a written notification 
that an administrative case against them was opened. Should the court 
proceedings resolve in favour of the plaintiff, the Association of Young 
Lawyers of Tajikistan will be obliged to put an end to its free legal aid and 
human rights education and training activities.

while in detention in K5 Long Khanh prison in Dong Nai province. Sources

applied to the Cabinet for approval for receivingUS$350,000 of funding. On

the association. According to the information received, the 2008 Societies 
Law, amended in 2009, which makes it mandatory for associations to obtain 
the approval of the cabinet before obtaining foreign funding, has increased the 
power of officials to interfere in the work of associations.

<p>Alleged travel ban imposed on human rights defender.  According to the 
information received, on 3 August 2012, Mr. Abdullatif Ghaith, Chair of 
Addameer human rights NGO in Ramallah, was ordered to sign an order 
banning him from travelling abroad and stating that he constitutes a &#8213;threat to 
</p>
<p>national security&#8214;.  Mr. Ghaith is currently banned from entering the West 
Bank where Addameer&#8216;s office is located. The ban reportedly stems from an 
</p>
<p>order issued by the Israeli Military Commander on 9 October 2011 for a 
period of six months.  The ban was extended for an additional six months in 
April 2012.  The original order reportedly stated that the ban on Mr. Ghaith 
was deemed necessary to protect the security and public order of the &#8213;area&#8214;, 
</p>
<p>i.e. the West Bank. Mr. Gaith has been held in administrative detention 
without charge or trial in Israeli prisons on three separate occasions, each of 
which lasted six months. He was last detained in this manner from June 2004 
to January 2005.

<p>Alleged destruction of religious and historic sites, desecration of graves, 
intimidation and the excessive use of force against protesters.  According to 
the information received, attacks on Sufi sites in Tripoli began in October 
</p><p>2011. In late August of 2012, some armed assailants reportedly launched a 
series of attacks destroying Sidi Abdul- Salam al-Asmar al-Fituri, Asmariya 
Islamic University complex, al-Sha'ab Mosque, shrine of Sheik Ahmad 
Zaruq, Gurgi Mosque, Uthman Pasha Madrassa and desecrating Sufi Muslim 
graves in Tripoli, Misurata, Derna and Zliten. The Ministry of the Interior had 
allegedly &#8213;authorized&#8214; the operation and maintained that the Supreme 
Security Council (SSC) forces did not seek to stop the demolition in order to 
&#8213;maintain order&#8214; and to avoid violence.  It was reported that peaceful 
</p>
<p>protestors of the demolition of the Al-Sha&#8216;ab mosque were obstructed from 
protesting by armed men while several demonstrators were physically 
threatened and intimidated. Nabil Shebani, a journalist from the Libyan 
television station, Alassema, was also reported to be detained whilst 
attempting to report on the destruction of the Al-Sha&#8216;ab mosque. An imam of 
a Tripoli mosque, Ashraf Jerbi, who took part in the protest, was physically 
intimidated and subjected to cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment by 
Libyan security forces after being detained.

<p>Alleged sentencing to death by stoning for adultery of a 23-year old Sudanese 
woman resident of South Kordofan. According to information received, on 10 
July 2012, Ms. Layla Ibrahim Issa was sentenced to death by stoning by the 
Mayo court in Khartoum, on charges of adultery under article 146 of Sudan&#8216;s  
</p>
<p>Criminal Code of 1991 (Decision No. N/A/15/execution/2012). The charge of 
adultery was reportedly brought against Ms. Ibrahim Issa by her husband, 
who claimed her 6 month old child is not his. It is reported that the court did 
not inform Ms. Ibrahim Issa about her rights, that she did not have access to a 
lawyer during her trial in contradiction of Article 135 of the 1991 Criminal 
Procedure Act, and that she was convicted based on her alleged confession. 
She is reportedly now detained in Omdurman Women&#8216;s Prison in shackles 
</p>
<p>together with her 6-month old baby.

detained on terrorism charges, tried and sentenced to death by Egyptian state 
security courts in 2006. In 2011 the African Commission on Human and 
Peoples' Rights found that Egypt had violated their rights under the African 
Charter of Human and Peoples' Rights, notably on the basis of the failure of 
the state security courts to ensure that evidence obtained through torture was 
not admitted. The Egyptian Government reportedly lifted the death sentence 
but resubmitted the cases to the same state security court. The hearings would 
allegedly start on 12 September 2012.

Follow-up letter concerning the remaining UN Official held in detention in 
relation to the communal violence in Rakhine State, western Myanmar, which 
broke out in June 2012.  Following his previous country visit, during which 
he interviewed the six UN staff held in detention at that time, in this letter the 
Special Rapporteur reiterates his concerns regarding the legal grounds for the 
ongoing detention of the remaining UN Official, respect of due process rights, 
treatment and conditions in detention, and the length of pre-trial detention.  
The Special Rapporteur extends these concerns to the husband and the father 
of the detained UN Official, who have also been in detention since June 2012, 
and to the four International NGO staff members that remained in detention.  
In view of these human rights concerns, the Special Rapporteur called for the 
release of these persons and a review of their cases.

<p>Allegations of violations against human rights defenders, including attempted 
abduction, surveillance and intimidation. According to the information 
received, Dr. Nirmal Dewasiri, President of the Federation of University 
Teachers Unions and Secretary of the Arts Faculty Teachers' Association of 
the University of Colombo, has been subjected to repeated acts of surveillance 
and intimidation. Most recently, on 22 June 2012, Dr. Dewasiri received a 
phone call from a person who identified himself as one of two men from the 
Ministry of Defence who were witnessed on 19 June enquiring about him to 
neighbours. During the call, the man reportedly threatened to harm Dr. 
Dewasiri's family if he did not cease his trade union activities. On 5 July 
2012, prominent Sri Lanka X News journalist and human rights defender Mr. 
Shantha P. Wijesooriya was in the Colombo suburb of Nugegoda, when he 
noticed that he was being followed by a white van. He changed his route in 
order to avoid the van. While doing so, two unidentified persons attempted to 
grab him and drag him towards the van, the journalist managed to escape. 
Sources indicate that Mr. Wijesooriya and other Sri Lanka X News journalists 
have been repeatedly subjected to threats and intimidation since 2008. On 25 
April 2011, Mr. Wijesooriya was arrested and detained for seventeen days on 
charges of contempt for an article published by Sri Lanka X News. Since 
September 2011, Mr. Wijesooriya and members of his family have reportedly 
received visits from military intelligence and CID officials, while unidentified 
individuals have asked about the journalist near his home.

participating in an armed raid on a goldsmith shop in Baghdad in 2009, which

torture or ill-treatment, which raises serious concerns about respect of fair 
trial and due process safeguards. While the death sentence of Mr. Abdullah

Alleged situation of health and environmental problems and land rights issues 
affecting the Wayana indigenous communities of Puleowime (Apetina) and 
Kawemhakan (Anapayke) in Southeastern Suriname. According to the 
information received, the communities of Apetina and Anapayke have 
suffered health, environmental and other problems due to the alleged presence 
of small-scale gold mining operations in their traditional lands. Concerns are 
also raised about the potential impacts of a proposed hydroelectric project on 
the traditional lands of the Apetina and Anapayke communities. These issues 
relate in large part, according to the information received, to the lack of legal 
recognition and protection of the communities&#8216; lands.

<p>Alleged arbitrary detention of two Ahmadiyah Muslim community members 
in a jail located in al-Aziziya, in the &#8215;Ar-&#8215;Ar area. According to the 
information received, on May 14 2012, Mr. Sultan al-Enezi and Mr. Saud al-
Enezi were detained by the police without formal charges being brought 
against them. While in custody, the police and scholars from the Ministry of 
Islamic Affairs have reportedly visited them daily to convince them to recant 
their faith, and threatened them with the death penalty if they failed to do so. 
In the jail where they were held, they allegedly had limited means of 
communication with the outside world. The local Ahmadiyya Muslim 
community feared that they would be charged with apostasy, which carries 
the death penalty.

<p>Alleged unfair trials before the Bangladesh International Crimes Tribunal 
(BICT). According to the information received, Mr. Delwar Hossain Sayedee, 
Vice-President of Jamaat-e-Islami, Mr. Salauddin Quader Chowdhury, 
member of the Bangladesh National Party, Mr. Motiur Rahman Nizami,  
leader of Jamaat-e-Islami, Mr. Ghulam Azam,  former leader of Jamaat-e-

<p>Alleged use of labour camps for political prisoners and pattern of human 
rights violations committed therein. According to the information received, 
labour camps, also known as kwan-li-so, for political prisoners have been in 
operation since the 1950s in the Democratic People&#8216;s Republic of Korea. It is 
</p>
<p>reported that individuals who have committed or are perceived to have 
committed a political crime are involuntarily or forcibly taken to an 
interrogation facility, detained, and typically subjected to torture until a 
confession is obtained. After being declared guilty by the State Security 
Protection Agency, the detainee is either executed immediately or transferred 
to a prison camp. Throughout their detention, prisoners are reportedly not 
given a trial and are held incommunicado without notice of the charges laid 
down against them, nor information on the length or place of detention. 
According to reports, detainees have been held in harsh conditions. Prisoners, 
including children, have been subjected to forced labour. It is further alleged 
that torture and public executions are common within the camps. Reports also 
suggest that women have been subjected to sexual exploitation, rapes, forced 
abortions and killings. In at least four camps, the majority of prisoners 
reportedly remain in custody until their deaths. Over the past few decades, an 
estimated number of at least 400,000 prisoners have reportedly perished in the 
camps.

<p>crowd gathered in front of Mr. Albert Saber Ayyad&#8216;s apartment with the 
</p>
<p>intention of attacking him over a video he had posted  on the internet that was

after the arresting officer reportedly told them that Mr. Ayyad insulted Islam. 
Mr. Ayyad was charged with defamation of religion based on Article 98 of 
the Egyptian Penal Code and interrogated for hours about his religious beliefs. 
His lawyer was allegedly sent out of the interrogation room after commenting 
on the inappropriateness of the line of questioning. An appeal against the 
detention order was filed by a group of human rights organizations but 
reportedly denied.

<p>Allegations of on-going harassment of the non-governmental organization 
Suara Rakyat Malaysia (SUARAM). According to the information received, 
since July 2012 SUARAM has been investigated by the Companies 
Commission Malaysia (CCM) and the Social Security Organisation, under the 
Ministry of Human Resources (PERKESO) in relation to his financial 
situation. Furthermore, SUARAM is reportedly victim of a smear campaign in 
the media and beyond. According to reports, such investigations and attacks 
on SUARAM&#8216;s integrity may be politically motivated. SUARAM belongs to 
</p>
<p>the Coalition for Fair and Free Elections (BERSIH), which advocates for 
reform of the electoral process in Malaysia, and which has been the subject of 
earlier communications (see above, MYS 4/2012).

Alleged violent attacks against the Guarani &#8211; Kaiow&#225; indigenous community 
of Arrio Kor&#225;, which reportedly resulted in the disappearance and possible 
death of one community member. According to the information received, the 
Arrio Kor&#225; historically inhabited lands in the Mato Grosso do Sol region until 
the 1940s when they were displaced from their traditional lands to make way 
for non-indigenous settlers who came to the area to engage in large-scale 
agribusiness. On or about 10 August 2012, Arrio Kor&#225; community members 
began a peaceful protest that involved reoccupation of their claimed lands, 
reportedly in response to ongoing delays by the Government in resolving their 
land claims. As the protests were about to start, some 50 armed gunmen 
arrived and shot at the protestors. This situation is reportedly part of a broader 
pattern of violence between local farmers and indigenous communities in the 
context of efforts by indigenous peoples in Mato Grosso do Sul to attempt to 
regain rights over ancestral lands that are under the control of non-indigenous 
occupants.

Makhset Abdullayevich Djabbarbergenov, an Uzbek citizen, converted to 
Christianity in 2000 and became an active house church leader in Nukus, the

of Migration of Kazakhstan. Mr. Djabbarbergenov appealed the decision but 
the appeal was allegedly rejected on a number of occasions. The case is now 
pending before the Supreme Court of Kazakhstan. Meanwhile, in February 
2012 Mr. Djabbarbergenov was put on a wanted list of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States and an arrest warrant with a view to his extradition was 
issued against him. Reportedly, Mr. Djabbarbergenov was subsequently 
detained by police officers in Almaty, Kazakhstan, and is currently waiting

Allegations regarding the ongoing barriers to effective protection of 
indigenous peoples&#8216; rights in Nepal. According to the information received, 
</p>
<p>the Constituent Assembly, which was tasked with drafting a new Constitution 
in Nepal, was dissolved in May 2012, reportedly due to disagreements 
regarding the reorganization of the Nepali state under a federal structure 
defined along ethnic lines. This federal structure had been supported by 
indigenous representatives. With the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly 
and the current proposals for the creation of an entirely new body to take its 
place, concerns have been expressed that the progress made by indigenous 
members of the former Constituent Assembly could be lost. In addition, as a 
result of ongoing disagreements over the nature of the federal structure to be 
established in Nepal, incidents of criminal persecution of indigenous leaders 
in the country have been reported. Finally, various domestic laws still require 
reform in order to comply with relevant international standards. This letter 
follows up on the recommendations made in a 2009 report of the Special 
Rapporteur (A/HRC/12/34/Add.3) as well as a communication of 29 January 
2010 (A/HRC/15/37/Add.1).

Alleged imposition of the death penalty in violation of due process 
guarantees. According to the information received, Mr. Anthony Haynes, an 
African American man, has been sentenced to death for the murder of an off-
duty police officer in 1999 in Houston, Texas when he was 19 years old. No 
expert testimony was presented as evidence to the jurors in order to mitigate 
effects of youth. The failure of the court-appointed lawyer to raise in state 
appeals the claim of poor legal representation at trial barred such issues from 
federal judicial review. It has been reported that during the trial in 1999, the 
prosecution utilized &#8213;peremptory strikes&#8214; to dismiss four of the six 
</p>
<p>prospective African American jurors without being required to give explicit 
reasons. In 2009, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that Anthony 
Haynes should get a new trial. However, the US Supreme Court sent the case 
back to the Fifth Circuit which upheld the death sentence despite 
acknowledging the persuasive value of circumstantial indications of 
intentional racial discrimination in the case.

charged with running unregistered organisations, in contravention of the 
Private Voluntary Organisation Act. On 25 July 2012, a summons against Mr.

Cassation Court allegedly rejected all. 23 new conscientious objectors have 
been called to perform military service in 2012. On 7 May 2012, an 
application was submitted to the Government requesting that their call-up be 
postponed until genuine alternative civilian service is offered to conscientious 
objectors. The application was reportedly ignored and criminal prosecutions 
were launched in some of these cases.

Police Station for interrogation, during which time his lawyer was allegedly 
denied access. Mr. Al-Maskati was detained overnight and appeared the 
following day before the Public Prosecution Office, where charges of &#8213;rioting

<p>Alleged arbitrary closure of a human rights association. According to the 
information received, on 9 October 2012, the Minsk economic court decided 
to close down the association Platforma, on the basis that it had allegedly 
missed a deadline for submitting tax declarations and failed to notify the tax 
inspection of its move to a new office. It is reported that the organization had 
submitted all papers to the tax inspection authority in due time and has not 
moved to any new office; it has therefore not failed to comply with the legal 
requirements. It is further reported that Platforma has been repeatedly 
subjected to acts of harassment and reprisals over the past months, in 
particular since its representatives participated in the 47th session of the UN 
Committee against Torture in November 2011.

<p>Alleged threat to the enjoyment of human rights of over 100,000 single 
parents, some of the most marginalized and impoverished members of 
Australian society, by a number of provisions in the Social Security 
Legislation Amendment (Fair Incentives to Work) Act 2012, recently passed 
by the Australian parliament. According to information received, the new Act 
will move more than 100,000 single parents (over 90% of which are women), 
from receipt of the Parenting Payment to the Newstart Allowance. The 
Parenting Payment stands at 90% of the relative poverty line in Australia, 
while the Newstart Allowance is 77% of the official poverty line. It is alleged 
that the legislation will have significant and detrimental impacts on the human 
rights of over 100,000 Australians, many of whom are currently living in 
poverty, will provide an institutional obstacle to the full enjoyment of human 
rights for people living in extreme poverty and increase discrimination against 
sole parents.

Allegations received concerning agricultural development in the lower Omo

well as the Government&#8216;s &#8213;villagization&#8214; programme. According to the 
</p>
<p>information received, resettlements of indigenous agro-pastoralist groups is 
underway in the lower Omo valley and the Southern Nations, Nationalities 
and Peoples&#8216; Region to make way for the Government&#8216;s proposed 
</p>
<p>development plans for the regions. The resettlements are reportedly part of the 
Ethiopian Government&#8216;s larger &#8213;villagization&#8214; program instituted in at least 
</p>
<p>four other regions of the country. The villagization program reportedly 
consists of the relocation of pastoralist, agro-pastoralist and shifting 
cultivators into sedentary villages where they are supposedly provided with 
improved social services, housing and infrastructure. Numerous concerns 
have been raised in relation to this programme, including that the Government 
has failed to obtain the consent of affected indigenous groups prior to 
resettlement and the lack of services provided at resettlement sites. The Gibe 
III hydroelectric project was the subject of previous exchanges with the 
Government of Ethiopia (A/HRC/21/47/Add.3, case no. ETH 1/2011).

<p>Alleged discriminatory restrictions and systematic violations of the right to

information received, Chin Christians face many difficulties in getting

Reportedly, they had to resort to using &#8213;house&#8214; churches but more than 100

<p>churches, including &#8213;house&#8214; churches were allegedly closed down by the

religious gatherings; even when permission is obtained, gatherings are often 
disbanded by the army. Between 1992 and 2009, 15 separate monasteries and 
pagodas were allegedly built using forced labour of the Chin Christians on 
land forcibly confiscated from them. It was further alleged that Chin 
Christians faced immense pressure to convert during the food security crisis 
in order to obtain humanitarian aid. Many Chin Christian students face 
induced and coerced conversions at Na Ta La schools or are subjected to 
harsh punishment, hard labour and de facto military conscription.

Alleged imposition of the death penalty on a person with mental health

sentenced to death for a murder committed in 1991 in Dallas, Texas during a 
burglary when he was 19 years old. Mr. Hines was scheduled for execution in 
2003, but this was stayed whilst the question of whether he had &#8213;mental 
</p>
<p>retardation&#8214; was decided. Evidence of his intellectual disability was presented 
</p>
<p>by his lawyer. However, the state court, without holding a hearing, decided 
that Mr. Hines did not qualify for relief. Moreover, it has been reported that 
he was physically abused by his father during his childhood. While some 
information of Mr. Hines&#8216; history as a victim of abuse was presented as 
evidence to the jurors, there was no expert testimony as to how this impacted 
on his conduct. The failure of inadequate assistance of trial counsel was not 
raised in state appeals, and it was barred from federal review.

According to the information received, in October 2001, Mr. Abdulrahman

<p>Allegations concerning the situation of oil palm cultivation in Higaonon 
indigenous communities in the municipality of Opol, Misamis Oriental in 
southern Philippines, as well as the alleged killing of an indigenous Higaonon 
leader who had protested against the oil palm cultivation. According to the 
allegations received, local government officials have actively promoted and 
facilitated oil palm plantations within Opol, Misamis Oriental without 
consideration of the land and natural resource rights of the indigenous peoples 
in the area. The alleged removal of Higaonon community members from their 
lands to make way for oil palm cultivation has reportedly led to the serious 
disruption of Higaonon agricultural and other traditional practices in their 
ancestral lands. It has also been alleged that Higaonon leaders who have 
actively opposed and criticized oil palm operations have been threatened and 
assaulted by company employees and in some cases by law enforcement 
officials. In this connection, information has been received regarding the 
shooting and killing of Gilbert Paborada, an indigenous Higaonon leader who 
had protested against oil palm operations.

Allegations concerning the human rights situation of the Guarani-Kaiow&#225; 
community of Pyelito Kue/Mbarakay in Mato Grosso do Sul who allegedly 
face the risk of eviction from lands considered to be their traditional territory. 
According to the information received, since November 2011, 170 members 
of the Guarani-Kaiow&#225; community of Pyelito Kue/Mbarakay in the state of 
Mato Grosso do Sul have occupied a two hectare area within lands they 
consider to be part of their ancestral territory, after armed men allegedly 
connected to local landowners destroyed their previous settlement. This 
occupation is allegedly the result of the community&#8216;s frustration over delays 
</p>
<p>in the Government&#8216;s demarcation of its lands. At the request of the plantation 
</p>
<p>owners, a federal court ordered the eviction of the Pyelito Kue/Mbarakay 
community in September 2012. Due to outcries by the community and action 
by the National Indian Foundation (FUNAI), this order was suspended on 29 
October 2012 pending the completion of the anthropological studies needed 
for the demarcation of the community&#8216;s lands and on the condition that 
community members to remain only within a one hectare area, and not the 
two hectare area they have settled since November 2011. However, the 
Pyelito Kue/Mbarakay community still faces the threats of violence and 
reprisals from local landowners.

Alleged imposition of the death penalty on two prisoners on death row. 
According to the information received, in October 2012, the Governor of Edo 
State signed execution warrants of two prisoners on death row in Oko prison, 
Benin City. Allegedly, the recent jailbreak in Oko prison, in which death row 
inmates were involved, prompted the Governor&#8216;s decision to sign the two 
execution warrants. Moreover, it is alleged that the prisoners have not 
officially been informed about the planned executions nor have the families of 
the prisoners officially been contacted by the Benin City prison authorities.  It 
is further reported that they were convicted on charges of murder and 
sentenced to death by hanging in January and June 1996, respectively. In 
March 2010, the Nigerian NGO, Legal Defence and Assistance Project 
(LEDAP), filed a domestic law suit on behalf of 826 inmates on death row, 
including the two death row inmates whose execution warrants were recently 
signed. It also reported that the Federal High Court granted an injunction 
against their execution. However, it was later lifted. On 19 October, the NGO 
filed a new suit at the Federal High Court on behalf of the two prisoners, the 
decision on which is pending. In addition, it is alleged that there is a high risk 
of execution before the appeal procedure is complete.

<p>Alleged interrogation and detention of two staff members of International

November 2012, Mr. Conor Prasat, an ICG analyst, conducted interviews 
with human rights defenders and other civil society actors in Osh and Kara-
Suu, accompanied by an ICG driver. Reportedly, during their journey back to 
Bishkek on 17 November 2012, their vehicle was stopped by a traffic police 
officer, following which the two staff members were ordered by four Uzgen 
National Security Agency (GKNB) officers to follow their vehicle to the 
GKNB offices in Uzgen. Upon their arrival, Mr. Prasat and the ICG driver 
were allegedly separated and interrogated by GKNB officers, reportedly 
without legal representation. Following their interrogation, a one hour search 
of the detainees&#8216; vehicle took place, during which several items were 
</p>
<p>confiscated. Allegedly, no search warrant was presented. The two ICG staff 
members were reportedly released later that day, after being forced to sign a 
document declaring that they would remain in Osh Province, pending an 
investigation of the items confiscated. Attempts by Mr. Prasat and the ICG 
driver on 19 and 20 November to gain permission to leave Osh province were 
unsuccessful.

<p>Alleged repeated restrictions to the right to freedom of association imposed 
on the Ethiopian Human Rights Council (EHRCO) and other organizations. 
According to the information received, in December 2009, the assets of the 
EHRCO, a prominent human rights organization, were frozen by the Charities 
and Societies Agency, which is responsible for overseeing NGOs&#8216; activities. 
On 19 October 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the decision to freeze the 
assets of the EHRCO. On 27 October 2012, the Charities and Societies 
Agency announced that it had revoked the licenses of 10 organizations and 
warned 400 other organizations that it said were operating against rules and 
regulations of the country. It is reported that these measures form part of a 
broader pattern of undue restrictions on the right to freedom of association, as 
a result of several restrictive provisions contained in the Charities and 
Societies Proclamation, 2009.

Alleged seizure of an Argentine naval vessel in Ghana by a &#8213;vulture fund&#8214; 
</p>
<p>belonging to US based investment firm. According to information received, 
the Argentine naval vessel, ARA Libertad, has been seized in the port of 
Tema in Ghana since 2 October 2012 under a Ghanaian court order sought by 
the equity investment fund NML Capital Limited, a subsidiary of the US 
based investment firm Elliot Capital Management. NML Capital is suing 
Argentina on the basis of debt arising from the country&#8216;s defaulted bond 
swaps in 2005 and 2010. NML Capital Ltd reportedly is only willing to 
release the ship against a payment of USD 20 million in Argentine bonds, and 
demands that Argentina settles USD 370 million of its debt. NML Capital 
bought bonds at a sum far less than their market value from the heavily 
indebted Argentine government in 2000, a year before the country&#8216;s USD 100 
</p>
<p>billion sovereign default. The fund did not accept the debt restructuring 
offered by the Argentine Government and continues to pursue Argentina in 
various jurisdictions including Ghana.

<p>Alleged closure of the Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the 
North by Government authorities. According to the information received, the 
Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North (RAIPON) is an 
organization formed in 1990 to promote the human rights of indigenous 
peoples in the North, Siberia and Far East regions of the Russian Federation. 
The organization represents 41 indigenous groups and around 34 regional and 
ethnic organizations, and has various regional offices throughout the Russian 
Federation. RAIPON&#8216;s work has focused on issues related to the protection of 
</p>
<p>indigenous traditional lands, self-governance and social, economic and 
cultural development. In November 2012, the Ministry of Justice of the 
Russian Federation ordered the suspension of RAIPON&#8216;s activities until April 
</p>
<p>2013 reportedly due to noncompliance of the organization&#8216;s charter and 
</p>
<p>statutes with Russian federal legislation. RAIPON has previously attempted to 
adjust its internal statutes to meet the Ministry of Justice&#8216;s requirements. 
However, it has been reported that those changes have not been considered 
acceptable by the Ministry of Justice.

<p>Alleged interrogation and deportation of human rights defender and 
withdrawal of citizenship of 31 political activists. According to the 
information received, on 15 November 2012, Dr. Nada Dhaif, along with her 
husband and two children, were denied access to Kuwait and were 
subsequently deported. Upon their arrival at Alniuissib Port, Dr. Dhaif was 
allegedly separated from her family and interrogated on her role in alleged 
anti-Government protests. She was reportedly also questioned on her and her 
husband&#8216;s religion, and was denied legal representation during the 
</p>
<p>interrogation. Dr. Dhaif, Chairperson of the Bahrain Rehabilitation and Anti-
Violence Organization, was subsequently informed that her name was on a 
list of Bahraini citizens who were denied entry to Kuwait, reportedly provided 
by the Government of Bahrain in July 2012. Furthermore, on 7 November 
2012, the Ministry of the Interior published a list of names of 31 individuals, 
whose Bahraini citizenship was allegedly revoked by the Ministry on the 
grounds that the listed persons were allegedly &#8213;damaging the security of the 
</p>
<p>State&#8214;. Of the published names, the majority are reportedly Shiite political 
</p>
<p>activists, two of which are human rights defenders: Mr. Abbas Omran and 
Mr. Taymour Karimi. 19 of the 31 listed individuals do not reportedly hold 
another nationality and are therefore now stateless.

<p>Alleged arrest, detention and violation of due process of human rights 
defender. According to the information received, Mr. Ahmed Al Shami is the 
Director of the World Organization for Human Rights, based in Tripoli, and is 
also mandated by the Libyan Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International 
Cooperation to negociate and facilitate the return of Libyan detainees from 
Iraq. On 18 October 2012, during his most recent repatriation mission to Iraq, 
Mr. Al Shami reportedly accompanied a representative of the League of Arab 
States to Baghdad International Airport. While at the airport, Mr. Al Shami 
was allegedly arrested by Iraqi Security Services agents and has since then 
been detained in Baghdad Central Prison. Reportedly, charges have not been 
brought against him. It was reported that on 6 November 2012, Mr. Al Shami 
appeared before a judge, who ordered his release on the basis of a lack of 
supporting evidence for his detention or criminal prosecution, which has not 
been implemented. It is further reported that Mr. Al Shami has been denied 
legal representation, is being detained in solitary confinement, and has not 
been allowed to contact family members.

<p>Alleged violation of the fair trial and due process rights. According to the 
information received, Dr. Tun Aung, Chairman of the Islamic Religious 
Affairs Council in Rakhine State, Myanmar, was arrested on 11 June 2012 on 
charges related to communal violence in Rakhine State in early June. He was 
allegedly held incommunicado for three months. In September 2012, he was 
convicted and sentenced under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947, 
Section 24 (1) to three years imprisonment. Since Dr. Aung&#8216;s initial arrest on 
11 June and throughout his subsequent trials, he has reportedly been denied 
the right to appoint a lawyer of his choice, instead being allocated a state 
lawyer whom he had not been allowed to meet privately. He has also been 
denied contact with his family. Dr. Aung suffers from a pituitary tumour and 
requires medication to manage this condition. In prison, he is not receiving 
the required medications.

<p>Alleged possible blasphemy charges against a law lecturer in Aceh. 
According to the information received, Mr. Mirza Alfath has been voicing 
criticisms concerning the implementation of the Sharia Law on his Facebook 
page. On 3 July 2012, Mr. Alfath reportedly wrote on the Facebook page his 
opinions on Sharia Law that had caused Mr. Teuku Zulkhairi, a Muslim 
activist, to react by writing a letter to Serambi, the largest daily newspaper in 
Aceh, on 20 November 2012 complaining that Mr. Alfath had allegedly 
insulted Islam. Subsequently, an angry mob reportedly went to Mr. Alfath&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>house in the evening of 20 November 2012, throwing stones and planning to 
attack him. The police came allegedly to secure Mr. Alfath but he was taken 
into police custody where he remains to the present day.

<p>Alleged interrogation and deportation of prominent human rights defender. 
According to the information received, on 15 November 2012, Dr. Nada 
Dhaif, along with her husband and two children, were denied access to 
Kuwait and were deported. Upon their arrival at Alniuissib Port, Dr. Dhaif 
was allegedly separated from her family and interrogated for a total of four 
hours by two civilian clothed individuals, reportedly State Security agents, on 
her role in alleged anti-Government protests in Bahrain. Sources state that she 
was also questioned on her and her husband's religion, and was denied legal 
representation during the interrogation. Dr. Nada Dhaif, Chairperson of 
Bahrain Rehabilitation and Anti-Violence Organization, was informed that 
she was not welcome in Kuwait as her name appeared on a list of Bahraini 
citizens who were denied entry to the country, a list reportedly provided by 
the Government of Bahrain to the authorities of Kuwait in July 2012.

Yint Htun, Naing Win, Nay Zaw Htet and Saw Naung were assaulted and 
arrested by security forces while peacefully marching to Naypyidaw to protest 
the closure of their mine in Yemathin township ordered by the Government. 
On 28 November 2012, Ko Wai Lu, Daw Shan Ma, Ko Myo Chit, Ko Ye Lin,

of the penal code. In addition, on the same day, arrest warrants were issued 
against the following activists: Ko Han Win Aung, Ko Thi Ha Win Tin, Ko 
Aung Naing Thu and Ko Moe Thway. On 29 November 2012, the riot police 
dispersed hundreds of protestors, using incendiary devices. More than 80 
persons have been injured. One monk is reportedly in critical condition, and 
had to be transferred to a hospital in Mandalay.

Allegations of complicity in torture. According to the information received, 
Mr. Shaker Aamer was captured by Northern Alliance forces in Kabul in 
December 2001 and held there in an underground prison while Kabul was 
under joint US and UK control. Around 25 December 2001, he was reportedly 
transferred from the Kabul prison to the Bagram Airforce Base by US forces. 
In January 2002, he was reportedly transferred with a US aircraft to Kandahar 
Airforce Base in Afghanistan under US control. UK officials were reportedly 
present at the detention facilities at both Bagram and Kandahar, where he was 
subjected to inhuman treatment. He was allegedly tortured during 
interrogations during which UK officials were present. Personal information 
allegedly provided by the UK was used by the US interrogators. On 13 
February 2002, he was reportedly rendered to Guantanamo Bay. In November 
2004, he was declared an &#8215;enemy combatant&#8216;. Although he has reportedly 
been cleared for release from Guantanamo Bay since 2007, he still remained 
detained at that facility.

<p>Alleged indefinite detention, lack of access to lawyers and impunity for 
torture of five non-US citizens detained at Guantanamo Bay. According to the 
information received, on 26 January 2012 Mr. Khalid Sheikh Mohammad, 
Mr. Walid Muhammad Salih Mubarak Bin Attash, Mr. Ramzi Binalshibh, Mr. 
Ali Abdul Aziz Ali (also known as Anmar al-Baluchi) and Mr. Mustafa 
Ahmed Adam Al Hawsawi were charged in connection with the 11 
September 2001 attacks on the United States and are facing multiple charges. 
Allegedly, the accused are not able to fully access legal representation due to 
the presumptive classification order issued on 26 April. Further, the practice 
of presumption classification compromises privileged lawyer-client 
communications. Also of concern is the continued lack of accountability 
regarding abusive interrogation techniques used in foreign detention facilities 
operated by the Government, including Guantanamo Bay and the failure to 
conduct prompt and impartial investigations.  Another concern is the 
continued indefinite detention of the accused who are subject to a periodic 
review regarding their detention which effectively allows indefinite detention 
if the accused poses a threat to the national security so that even if there may 
be an acquittal after the trial, the accused will never be released.

According to the information received, on 13 February 2006, a peaceful protest 
was violently suppressed by the security forces and members of the Hojatieh and 
Fatemiyon pro-government groups.  The protest was being held against an order by 
the security forces to evacuate the community's place of worship, known as 
Hosseiniye.  The 173 individuals were reportedly interrogated at Fajr prison in 
Qom and there were concerns that they were tortured in order to force them to sign 
pre-prepared false confessions, stating that the protest had political motivations and 
was linked to anti-government groups.  Lawyer Bahman Nazari was reportedly 
arrested when he approached officials in an attempt to represent the detainees.  
Arrest warrants were reportedly issued for the main Sufi preacher in Qom, Seyed 
Ahmadi Shariati and the four lawyers who had previously been acting on behalf of 
the group.  Their names are Amir Eslami, Omid Behrouzi, Gholamreza Harsimi 
and Farshid Yadollahi.

<p>Alleged forced eviction of more than 200 farmers. According to the information 
received, in May 2008, at least 200 farmers from Polong and Noliasahi villages in 
Jagatsinghpur district in Orissa state were subject to forced evictions in order to 
make way for a steel plant and a captive port. During the eviction, the Orissa state 
authorities, aided by 150 armed police force officials, reportedly destroyed betel 
vine crops and cultivation sheds. Following the eviction, the lands were fenced off 
in order to prevent the farmers from accessing them. In addition, evictions of more 
than 470 families living and working in the Erasama block of Jagatsinghpur 
District and demolition of their houses and crops had allegedly been planned. The 
land acquisition would reportedly affect the livelihood of local communities who 
depend on betel vine and cashew nut cultivation and fishing in the area.

Alleged negative impact on the access to medicines by the Trans Pacific 
Partnership agreements. According to the information received, several rounds of 
negotiations on the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreements have been held 
among the Governments of Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, 
Singapore, the United States and Vietnam since March 2010. Some of the TPP&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>intellectual property provisions would reportedly strengthen monopolies for life-
saving medicines and create barriers for access to medicines. It is further alleged 
that new intellectual property standards would not only result in high prices for 
medicines but could also negatively impact the ability of developing countries to

<p>Alleged arbitrary detention and solitary confinement of human rights lawyer and 
defender. According to the information received, Mr. Abdolfattah Soltani, a well 
known human rights lawyer and defender, was arrested on 10 September 2011 in 
the corridors of the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Tehran by security agents 
allegedly holding an arrest warrant. Mr. Soltani was subsequently escorted to his 
law office then his home, where the police officers confiscated computers and 
several of his personal and family documents. The agents reportedly did not have 
any warrants to authorize the search of Mr. Soltani&#8216;s office and home. Reportedly, 
his lawyer had not been informed of the charges against Mr. Soltani. It is alleged 
that Mr. Soltani&#8216;s detention is linked to the fact that he has represented political 
</p>
<p>and human rights activists, including Akbar Ghanji, Zahra Kazemi, Zahra 
Baniyaghoub, Nasrin Sotoudeh and Haleh Esfandiari. Mr. Soltani had reportedly 
been kept in solitary confinement at the Ministry of Intelligence&#8216;s Section 209 of

</p>
<p>her involvement in peaceful demonstrations. On 4 September 2011, Ms. Fereshteh

State security&#8214;, &#8213;publicising lies&#8214; and &#8213;causing unease in the public mind.&#8214; On 14 
</p>

referred to Ms. Mohammadi&#8216;s human rights activities as attempts to overthrow the 
</p>
<p>Islamic Republic.  Ms. Shiva Nazar-Ahai was reportedly sentenced on 8 January 
2011 by Branch 36 of the Tehran Appeals Court to four years imprisonment to be 
spent in internal exile away from her home. The sentence reportedly relates to 
charges of &#8213;attempts to deface the Islamic Government&#8214;, &#8213;disturbing the public 
</p>

<p>Alleged acts of intimidation. According to information received, on 5 November

the organisation &#8213;Dodhichi&#8214;, aimed at reporting human rights violations committed 
</p>
<p>by authorities of the state of West Bengal and at promoting women&#8216;s rights and the 
right to education, while they were outside is house.  They told him that they had 
come to seize his SIM card and alleged that they were the Sub-Inspector and 
Assistant Sub-Inspector of Police at Sonarpur Police Station. Reportedly they 
wanted to confiscate other items belonging to him but Mr. Roy requested a legal 
order from the court. The two policemen called the Officer-in-Charge of Sonarpur 
Police Station before leaving and telling Mr. Roy that they would come back. Mr. 
Roy allegedly sends text messages to inform civil society groups about cases of 
human rights violations occurred in his community and to make people aware of

Alleged impact on human rights compliance and accountability for human rights 
violations of proposed new legislation and recent domestic court decisions.  
According to the information received, although the Status of Forces Agreement 
between the United States and Iraq will expire on 31 December 2011, some U.S. 
private military and security companies will remain in the country.  The legal 
status and accountability of PMSCs in Iraq and elsewhere is unclear.  The Civilian 
Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, which would extend United States jurisdiction 
over PMSC employees that commit certain crimes while working for the United 
States abroad, contains a carve-out for authorised intelligence activities that 
undermines the possibility of comprehensive criminal accountability for PMSC 
employees involved in serious human rights violations.  Also according to 
information received, several recent United States court cases directly relate to, or

<p>Alleged ill-treatment and on-going detention of members of the Human Rights 
Society of Uzbekistan (HRSU). According to information received, on 16 
November 2011, Mr. Azamjon Formonov was subjected to beatings and ill-
treatment while in detention at the 64/71 Special Regime Colony to force him to 
write a letter concerning his treatment while in detention. Other members of 
HRSU, Messrs. Nasim Isakov, Alisher Karamatov and Gaybullo Jalilov, continue 
to be detained and have allegedly been subjected to ill-treatment as well while in 
detention. Mr. Zafar  Rahimov remains in detention since being imprisoned in 
October 2007.  Mr. Khabibilla Okpulatov remains in detention since 2005 and his 
sentence was extended in August 2009 before he was due to be released. Mr. 
Azamjon Formonov and Mr. Alisher Karamatov were the subjects of previous 
communications (see A/HRC/4/37/Add.1 paras 715 &amp; 719). Mr. Gaybullo Jalilov 
was the subject of previous communications (see A/HRC/18/51, case no. UZB 
7/2010).

<p>Alleged dire social and economic conditions of the Attawapiskat First Nation, 
northern Ontario, Canada, and the alleged poor living conditions in aboriginal 
reserves. According to the information received, many of the Attawapiskat First 
Nation live in unheated shacks or trailers, with no running water, posing severe 
problems in light of the impending harsh winter. Reportedly, the Government of 
Canada has agreed to provide emergency housing in Attawapiskat to address the 
crisis situation. However, this assistance has allegedly been made contingent on 
third party management of funds, which the Attawapiskat First Nation reject as not 
being responsive to their needs.  The Band also reportedly continue to suffer from 
the effects of a number of disasters, including an oil spill in 1979 that destroyed the 
public schools and a massive sewage flood in 2009, allegedly caused by a DeBeers 
diamond mine located on Attawapiskat traditional lands. First Nations 
communities are reportedly systematically underfunded as compared to non-
Aboriginal towns, and the federal government allegedly maintains a 2% cap on 
spending increases for core services for Aboriginal peoples and cities.

<p>Alleged trial of human rights defender on charges of l&#232;se majest&#233;. According to the 
information received, on 30 April 2011, Mr. Somyot Prueksakasemsuk, human 
rights defender and magazine editor, was arrested at Aranyaprathet district, Sa 
Kaeo Province, and charged with contravening the l&#232;se majest&#233; law. His arrest 
came only five days after he held a press conference in Bangkok launching a 
campaign to collect 10,000 signatures to petition for a parliamentary review of the 
l&#232;se majest&#233; law or Section 112 of the Thai Criminal Code. He was reportedly 
detained in Bangkok Special Prison and transferred to Sa Kaeo Provincial Court on 
12 November 2011. On 1 November 2011, his fourth bail request was denied. 
Different venues in different parts of Thailand, and different judges, have been 
allocated for the remainder of the hearing which will allegedly place an undue 
burden on Mr. Prueksakasemsuk. Mr. Prueksakasemsuk was the subject of a 
previous communication (see A/HRC/19/44, case no THA 5/2011).

<p>Allegation of increased tension between the Government and the Judiciary, which 
culminated on 16 January 2012 in the arrest and detention of the Chief Judge of the 
Criminal Court. According to the information received, Mr. Abdulla Mohamed 
was arbitrarily arrested in violation of the procedures established by the law and 
was reportedly held incommunicado until 20 January 2012. The Government has 
publicly explained the arrest as a consequence of the inability or unwillingness of 
the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) to take disciplinary action against judge 
Mohamed and therefore guarantee the accountability of judges in general. 
However legitimate may be the concerns over the effective functioning of the JSC, 
the behaviour of some judges and the situation of the judiciary as a whole, this 
does not authorize in any way resorting to unlawful arrest and detention, as in the 
case of Mr. Mohamed.

instituci&#243;n. Un grupo de padres de familia, estudiantes y docentes ocuparon el liceo

<p>Alleged implications of the recently adopted Constitutional and related legal 
provisions for the independence of the judiciary. According to information 
received, the Republic of Hungary adopted in 2011 a new Constitution and several 
cardinal acts related to the justice system and its functioning. Several provisions of

Curia and the President of the National Judicial Office, the duties of the President 
of the National Judicial Office, and the new provisions on the retirement age of 
judges. In addition, information was received regarding the powers of the 
Prosecution service and their insufficient separation from judicial functions.

demonstrators were injured, and a number were detained. At the time of drafting 
the urgent appeal, several individuals remained in detention or under house arrest.

<p>Alleged arrest and deportation of a journalist. According to the information 
received, on 9 February 2012, Mr. Hamza Kashgari was arrested at Kuala Lumpur 
International Airport following the issue of an arrest warrant by the Saudi Arabian 
authorities. Mr. Kashgari is a journalist for Al-Belad (The Country), a newspaper 
owned by the Saudi Arabian Government, and a blogger. He was allegedly held in 
detention in the Travel Control Section in the Bukit Aman area of Kuala Lumpur. 
Prior to his arrest he had reportedly fled Saudi Arabia after accusations of apostasy 
were made against him in relation to an online post he had made concerning the 
Prophet Mohammed. On 12 February 2012, he was allegedly deported from 
Malaysia to Saudi Arabia and has since remained in detention in Riyadh. Despite 
publicly repenting and declaring himself a Muslim, Mr. Kashgari is reportedly at 
serious risk of being charged with blasphemy and consequently receiving a death 
sentence as a result of his post on Twitter.

<p>Alleged threat to the enjoyment of human rights by Australia&#8216;s indigenous 
communities, in particular the right to equality and non-discrimination, following 
the proposed adoption of the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Bill 2012. 
According to information received, the Bill (third reading) extends the uniform 
alcohol bans and alcohol management regimes within so-called &#8213;alcohol protected 
areas&#8214; within Northern Territory communities (Sections 27).  The Social Security 
</p>
<p>bill extends measures enabling compulsory income management of Centrelink 
recipients in certain circumstances (Schedule 1). The bill also extends the 
Government&#8216;s Improving School Enrolment and Attendance through Welfare 
</p>
<p>Reform Measure (SEAM) initiative, which allows for the suspension or 
cancellation of certain categories of Centrelink payments for lack of compliance 
with a notice relating to the school enrolment or attendance. The Stronger Futures 
Bill introduces &#8213;special measures&#8214; to allow the Commonwealth to amend Northern 
</p>
<p>Territory legislation regarding leasing in Aboriginal community living areas and 
town camps (Part 3). In addition, there have reportedly been insufficient 
consultations with affected indigenous communities throughout the process of 
drafting the Stronger Futures Bills.

<p>Alleged deportation and secret detention in Uzbekistan. According to the 
information received, Mr. X fled to the Republic of Korea in 2008 to escape 
religious persecution in Uzbekistan. Reportedly, on 7 February 2012, he was 
arrested on the basis of alleged illegal entry and stay in the country and was taken

status and was deported to Uzbekistan. Mr. X was reportedly not given a chance to 
appeal to the Minister of Justice which he was entitled to within 14 days. His 
mother later learned from the local police that her son had been taken to the 
National Security Service by the so-called secret police. His fate and whereabouts

<p>Alleged risk of execution for a drug trafficking offence following denial of a 
judicial appeal. According to the information received, Mr. Yong Vui Kong, a 
national of Malaysia, was arrested on 13 June 2007, on charges of drug trafficking. 
Mr. Yong was found in possession of 47.27 grams of diamorphine. Under the 
Misuse of Drugs Act in Singapore, a defendant is reportedly automatically 
presumed guilty of drug trafficking in cases where possession of heroin exceeds 
two grams. On 14 November 2008, Mr. Kong was sentenced to death pursuant to 
section 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act. Mr. Yong&#8216;s last judicial complaint focused 
</p>
<p>on the alleged unequal treatment before the law and unequal protection of the law. 
On 4 April 2012, the Court of Appeal of Singapore dismissed Mr. Yong&#8216;s appeal.

<p>Alleged threats to the enjoyment of the rights to food, housing, water and 
sanitation, and health care for several communities in Banke, Nepal as a result of 
annual flooding caused by the Lakshmanpur Dam and the Kalkwala Afflux Bund. 
According to information received, annual floods threaten more than 3,000 
families of Holiya, Bethani, Mattaiya, Fattepur, Bankatti and Gangapur in the 
Banke district of Nepal. While some flooding in the area is a natural phenomenon, 
the annual flooding has been aggravated since the construction of the Lakshmanpur 
Dam in 1985 and, in particular the Kalkwala Afflux Bund built between 1999 and 
2000 by the Government of India along the Indo-Nepali border. Reportedly, the 
affected communities were not consulted prior to the construction of the dam and 
afflux bund in question. It is alleged that no proper resettlement plan has been put 
in place despite the challenges the affected communities face yearly.

entered into a contract with CDM to work at Phatthana Frozen Food Factory in 
Thailand. It is reported that his salary, attendance bonus and working days were 
less than what was stipulated in his contract. Accommodation and health care were 
allegedly not provided for. Moreover, part of his salary and his passport are 
reportedly withheld by his employer, to prevent him from leaving until his debts 
are settled. Reportedly, other cases point to a pattern of trafficking of migrant 
workers from Cambodia and Myanmar for labour exploitation and debt bondage in 
Thailand, particularly those working in Phatthana Frozen Food Factory and Vita 
Food Factory.

<p>Alleged threats and harassment against a human rights defender and his family and 
the alleged arbitrary detention or enforced disappearance of a number of his 
relatives and supporters. According to the information received, Mr Chen 
Guangcheng and his family have been under extralegal house arrest since 
September 2010, until Mr. Chen Guangcheng&#180;s alleged escape on 22 April 2012. 
Reportedly, on 26 April 2012, a group of men attempted to break into the home of 
Mr. Chen Guangfu, brother of Mr. Chen Guangcheng. Reports indicate that Mr. 
Chen Guangfu was detained before being subsequently released and forbidden 
from leaving his village. Mr. Chen Guangfu&#8216;s son, Mr. Chen Kegui, is allegedly in 
</p>
<p>custody in the Yinan County Detention Centre. Furthermore, on 28 April, Messrs. 
Chen Guangcun and Chen Hua, both cousins of Mr. Chen Guangcheng, were 
reportedly arrested. Their fate and whereabouts allegedly remained unclear. On 3 
May 2012, Mr. Jiang Tianyong was allegedly detained and beaten after attempting 
to visit Mr. Chen Guangcheng in hospital. It is further alleged that Mr. Chen 
Guangcheng's wife, Ms. Yuan Weijing, was harassed and threatened following her 
husband's alleged escape.

<p>Alleged incommunicado detention, torture, unfair trial and sentence to death for 
moharebeh. According to the information received, on 26 January 2009, security 
forces arrested Mr Behrouz Alakhani, a 26 year old Kurdish citizen,  on charges of 
cooperation with the Party of Free Life of Kurdistan (PJAK) and participation in 
the murder of the Khoy Prosecutor. He was held incommunicado for 19 months 
before his transfer to Orumiyeh Central Prison, and was allegedly subjected to 
severe psychological and physical torture. During his detention, he was reportedly 
deprived of access to a lawyer and contacts with family members. In December 
2010, Mr Alakhani was brought before Orumiyeh Revolutionary Court, where he 
was sentenced to ten years imprisonment for possessing and transporting arms, and 
to the death penalty on charges of moharebeh, following a trial which violated 
procedural safeguards.

<p>Alleged excessive use of force by law enforcement authorities against peaceful 
protestors, and acts of harassment against media personnel and human rights 
defenders. According to the information received, a public sit-in organized by the 
Coalition for Fair and Free Elections (Bersih) in Kuala Lumpur on 28 April 2012 
met with police brutality. The police reportedly used, in an indiscriminate manner, 
tear gas and water cannons to disperse the peaceful protestors injuring several of 
them. It is also reported that media personnel covering the protest were assaulted 
by security forces. Since this demonstration took place, Ms. Ambiga Sreenevasan, 
who is one of the leaders of the Coalition for Fair and Free Elections, has been, on 
different occasions, the target of severe and sustained acts of harassment and 
intimidation. Bersih members were the subject of a previous communication (see 
A/HRC/19/44, case no MYS 6/2011). Ms. Ambiga Sreenevasan was also the 
subject of a previous communication (see A/HRC/20/30, case no MYS 11/2011).

<p>Alleged imposition of travel bans on, due process violations against and sentencing 
of human rights defenders. According to the information received, on 13 February 
2011, the Minsk City Court dismissed Mr. Valiantsin Stefanovich&#8216;s appeal, 
upholding an order to pay a fine of 53 million rubles for &#8213;non-payment or 
incomplete payment of taxes&#8214;. Mr. Stefanovich is the Vice-Chairman of the 
Human Rights Centre &#8213;Viasna&#8214;. On 24 January 2012, the Minsk City Court 
</p>
<p>reportedly dismissed the appeal of Ales Bialiatski, Chairman of &#8213;Viasna&#8214; and 
FIDH Vice-President, upholding the sentence of four and a half years 
imprisonment and fines totalling 757 million rubles for &#8213;tax evasion on a large 
</p>
<p>scale&#8214;. It is alleged that these criminal cases were politically motivated. 
Reportedly, Mr. Aleh Volchek, Head of Legal Aid to the Population, was 
sentenced to four days of administrative detention on 30 January for &#8213;petty 
</p>
<p>hooliganism&#8214; after his organisation had published a report on the trial of Mr. 
Bialiatski. In March 2012, Ms. Zhanna Litvina, chairperson of the Belarusian 
Association of Journalists (BAJ), and Messrs. Valiantsin Stefanovich, Aleh Hulak,  
member of the Belarusian Helsinki Committee (BHC), Andrey Dynko, editor-in-
chief of the independent newspaper &#8213;Nasha Niva&#8214;, and Harry Pahanyayla, 
chairman of the Legal Commission of the BHC, were all allegedly denied 
permission to leave the country. Viasna, the BHC, the BAJ and Nasha Niva were 
among the subjects of an earlier communication (see A/HRC/19/44, case no BLR 
7/2011).

<p>Allegations concerning a decision by the Finland Supreme Administrative Court 
that has the effect of diminishing Sami self-determination. According to the 
information received, in order to register on the Sami electoral roll to elect 
representatives of the Sami Parliament, the Parliament has required that potential 
registrants meet both self-identification and language requirements. On the basis of 
these criteria, the Sami Parliament of Finland declined to admit four individuals 
onto its electoral register. However, in September 2011, the Finland Supreme 
Administrative Court reversed the decision of the Sami Parliament and decided 
that self-identification by any person with any ancestor registered as &#8213;Lapp&#8214; dating 
back to as far as 1763 should be a sufficient criterion for registration. Concern is 
expressed that elimination of the language requirement for registration to the 
electoral roll will result in an influx of registrants to the electoral roll and a diluting 
of Sami decision-making power within the Sami Parliament.

pronounced dead two days later by prison security, who claimed that he had 
committed suicide, while his former cellmates reportedly saw marks of severe 
torture on his body.

Alleged planned building of an eight-lane highway through the Bukit Brown 
Cemetery. According to information received, the Bukit Brown Cemetery, which is 
of remarkable natural, cultural and historical value, enables people to build a sense 
of identity and belonging to the region, is used as a space for the living cultural 
practices of people, is an important recreational and leisure space with a unique 
combination of heritage and nature, and provides a valuable database for 
researchers and scholars. In September 2011, the Government of Singapore 
reportedly announced the construction of a new road through the Bukit Brown 
Cemetery to relieve traffic congestion; the decision taken by the Government to 
build the road was allegedly not preceded by a meaningful consultation process.

Alleged threat of mass forced evictions and additional violations of the right to 
adequate housing following the recent adoption of the Law for the Transformation 
of Areas under Disaster Risk. According to information received, the Law of 18 
May 2012 threatens the enjoyment of the right to adequate housing of more than 
six million households. The Law presents a number of problematic provisions, in 
particular a lack of concrete definitions, accountability mechanisms, administrative 
or judicial recourse for affected communities, coupled with the extensive decision-
making powers of Government and local authorities with regard to the 
determination of buildings to be demolished and the actual demolition process. The 
implementation of the Bill as it is may allegedly lead to mass forced evictions, 
infringements on the rights to property and housing, and to an increased number of 
people made homeless or left in worse housing and living conditions. Reports 
received indicate that there has been very little consultation with potentially 
affected communities and civil society organizations during the drafting of the 
Law.

<p>Alleged killing of two human rights defenders. According to the information 
received, on 5 March 2012, Mr. Jimmy Liguyon was shot and killed at his home. 
Allegedly, the perpetrator declared that he had killed Mr. Liguyon for refusing to 
enter into agreements on behalf of his village with the San Fernando Matigsalug 
Tribal Datus Association (SANMATRIDA). Mr. Liguyon was the Vice-Chairman 
of Kasilo, an organization of indigenous peoples from the southern municipalities 
of Bukidon, and the village chief of Barangay Dao, San Fernando, Bukidnon, 
Mindanao. Reportedly, on 9 May 2012, Mr. Margarito Cabal was shot dead outside 
his home in Palma Village. Mr. Cabal was a member of the Save Pulangi Alliance, 
a coalition which opposes the construction of a hydro-electric dam in Mindanao 
which, once completed, allegedly threatens to submerge 22 peasant and indigenous 
communities.
