JUDGMENT

[1]     
The three assessors are unanimous that the Accused is guilty as charged. I direct myself in accordance with my summing up and I agree with them. I accept the evidence of Ruci Uluilakeba as being honest, reliable and accurate. I also accept that the only inference to be drawn from her evidence is the guilt of the Accused.

[2]     
I convict him accordingly.
