identification of the remains of victims of serious violations of human rights and of 
international humanitarian law, and to address the issue of impunity; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also encourages</i> States to consider the use of forensic genetics to contribute 
to the restoration of identity to those persons who were separated from their families, 
including those taken away from their relatives when they were children, in situations of 
serious violations of human rights and, in the context of armed conflicts, of violations of 
international humanitarian law; 
</p>

States to investigate serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law 
in accordance with their international legal commitments in terms of identifying victims of 
such violations, including through the use of forensic genetics, with a view to considering
