Outlook and Objectives for 2016
The  Company  is  a  junior  exploration  company  with  no  operating  assets  and  hence  its  activities  are  financed  from  the  sale  of  its 
common  stock.  The  amount  of  its  cash  resources  determine  how  much  work  may  be  done  on  its  properties.  In  2016,  efforts  are 
planned to focus on exploration at its Castelo de Sonhos project ("CDS") in Brazil and on general and administration expenses related 
to  running  the  Company.  The  Company  will  need  additional  funds  in  2016  to  complete  the  planned  drilling  at  CDS  (estimated 
between  $2.5  million  and  $4.0  million  depending  on  the  finalized  scope  and  interim  results  of  the  exploration  program)  and  fund 
corporate  overhead  (approximately  $3.0  million).  In  July,  the  Company  completed  a  private  placement  raising  Can$4.256  million, 
which  funds  were  used,  in  part,  to  make  the  July  cash  payment  of  $800,000  to  the  vendors  of  the  CDS  property.    Many  factors 
influence  the  Company's  ability  to  raise  funds,  including  the  health  of  capital  markets,  the  robustness  of  the  gold  market  and  the 
investors’  perception  of  the  Company's  planned  activities.  There  are  no  guarantees  that  the  Company  will  be  able  to  complete  the 
required financing in 2016.
Business Overview and Summary
The Company was incorporated under the British Columbia Business Corporations Act under the name of TriStar Gold Inc., on May 
21,  2010.  TriStar  was  created  to  hold  certain  existing  Brazauro  assets  as  a  result  of  an  Arrangement  Agreement  between  Brazauro 
Resources Corporation and Eldorado Gold Corporation. The completion of this Arrangement occurred on July 20, 2010.   
 
TriStar’s  primary  business  focus  is  the  acquisition,  exploration  and  development  of  precious  metal  prospects,  including  its  current 
focus on advancing the exploration of the Castelo de Sonhos project in the Tapajós Gold District of Brazil’s northerly Pará State. The 
Company is concentrating its exploration activities on the CDS property because the Company believes CDS has the potential to host 
several million ounces of gold (see the property description below). No work is planned in 2016 on the Bom Jardim property which is 
also located in Brazil.   
 
The  Company’s  current  properties  are  in  the  exploration  stage  and  have  not  yet  been  proven  to  be  commercially  developable.  The 
Company defers and capitalizes expenditures associated with the direct acquisition, evaluation and exploration of mineral properties.
1
The net capitalized cost of each mineral property is periodically compared to management's estimation of the net realizable value and 
a write-down is recorded if the net realizable value is less than the cumulative net capitalized costs. 
 
The Company is subject to regulation by the Federal  Mines Department in Brazil, the Departamento Nacional de Produção Mineral 
("DNPM").    The  Company  holds  exploration  licenses  and/or  applications  for  exploration  licenses  granted  or  to  be  granted  by  the 
DNPM for CDS.  The exploration licenses for CDS are subject to requirements to maintain rights over the properties.  With respect to 
the core exploration license on the CDS property, the Company was required to file a report by August, 2014 demonstrating sufficient 
exploration work has been conducted to determine the existence of a deposit, as defined by Brazilian regulations. The Company filed 
the required report at the end of July 2014.  Within twelve months of receiving approval of this report, the Company will have to file a 
feasibility study along with an application for a mining concession.  
  
Since its inception, the Company has had no revenues from operations other than minimal interest income on invested cash balances.  
The  Company  relies  on  the  sale  of  its  treasury  securities  to  fund  its  operations  and  the  Company’s  cash  position  is  currently 
insufficient to maintain its planned operations for a full year.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise any or 
sufficient funds to continue to fund its planned exploration program at CDS.

A. New Technical Report dated March 7, 2016 
 
Management believed that the 2014 Tecnical Report (see below), while accurate in its initial resource estimation, likely failed to fully 
convey the true potential of the CDS property. On January 29, 2016, Tristar Gold reported the following as an exploration target range 
for the Castelo de Sonhos gold project: (i) tonnage between 50 and 84 million tonnes; (ii) gold grade between 1.3 and 1.6 grams per 
tonne; and metal content between 2.1 and 4.3 million ounces.  The effective date for this 43-101 Technical Report was March 7, 2016, 
and it is filed on SEDAR. 
 
The exploration target range reported above is conceptual in nature and is NOT an estimate of mineral resources. There is no 
guarantee  that  the  additional  drilling  required  to  estimate  a  mineral  resource  will  be  done.  Nor  is  there  any  guarantee,  if 
additional drilling and exploration is done, that the project's mineral resources will eventually reach the target range. 
  
The  technical  report  provides  the  technical  and  scientific  information  used  to  support  the  above  mentioned  exploration  ranges.  The 
report  utilized  many  different  lines  of  evidence  and  honored  and  incorporated  all  past  exploration  and  data,  including:  (i)  available 
drill hole data; (ii) surface mapping and outcrop sampling; (iii) site visits and inspection of historical garimpeiro workings; (iv) hydro-
dynamics  of  fluvio-deltaic  systems;  (v)  preliminary  metallurgical  test  work;  (vi)  information  from  deposits  in  similar  geological 
settings and (vii) reconstructions of continental plates at the time of deposition. 
 
The  Company  believes  the  geology  and  mineralization  of  the  CDS  deposit  is  typical  of  a  paleoplacer  in  which  low-grade 
metamorphism may have remobilized gold over short distances in places. The sediments that now constitute the conglomerate bands 
at CDS that were formed approximately 2.0 to 2.1 billion years ago, likely in a near-shore environment or in a large inland basin close 
to the sea. CDS bears strong similarities to two other paleoplacers that were formed at approximately the same time and are producing 
mines; Tarkwa (Ghana) and Jacobina (Brazil). In all three of these deposits, gold is hosted in quartz-pebble supported conglomerates; 
furthermore, gold grades in all of these tend to be higher in the pebble-supported conglomerates and to generally decrease when the 
size, frequency, sorting and packing of pebbles indicates an environment  more distal from the source, lower in energy  where  water 
would flow more slowly and would be less able to keep gold grains and large pebbles in suspension. 
 
In all three deposits, the mineralized horizons within the conglomerate band show significant silicic and hematitic alteration, although 
Jacobina also contains abundant pyrite. It is believed the mineralogy of CDS is more similar to Tarkwa than Jacobina. Reconstructions 
of the relative  locations of cratons two billion  years ago indicate that they  formed a supercontinent close  to the  South Pole. At that 
time, lode deposits along a central mountain range provided a source for gold that rivers and creeks could transport downhill toward 
the coastline. 
 
Limited metallurgical work has been completed but recovery is anticipated to be excellent owing to the placer style of mineralization. 
Furthermore, the target exploration range reported herein was constrained inside hypothetical open pits utilizing, current metal prices 
at  the  date  of  publication  and  it  employed  a  "monte-carlo  simulation  technique"  to  identify  ranges  of  mineralization  within  the 
plausible models of the mineralization.

B. Property Overview and History of Prior Exploration 
 
Castelo de Sonhos consists of 31,032 hectares of mineral rights on six contiguous claims located approximately 15 kilometers (“km”) 
east  of  the  Cuiabá-Santarém  paved  highway  (BR-163).  The  host  rocks  for  the  property’s  gold  mineralization  are  quartzites,  meta-
arenites  and  metaconglomerates  of  the  Early  Proterozoic  (+2  billion  years  ago)  Castelo  de  Sonhos  Formation.  The  property 
encompasses a 15 km by 12 km plateau with an average elevation of 300 meters above the surrounding ground. The main creeks and 
drainages that  flow  from the  plateau  were extensively  mined for alluvial  gold  from 1987 to 1992 and the historic  gold output  from 
these artisanal mining operations has been estimated at 250,000 to 320,000 ounces. 
  
Barrick Gold Corp. conducted significant exploration at Castelo de Sonhos from June 1995 to November 1996 for which TriStar has 
recovered  the  exploration  data,  consisting  of  509  stream  sediment  samples;  3,093  soil  samples;  1,472  rock  samples;  2,313  trench 
samples and 23 diamond drill holes for a total of 2,027 meters. All these activities led to the definition of two large strong gold soil 
anomalies each of which extends for more than 2.5 km as well as positive gold intercepts in trench and drill core samples. 
 
The  soil  anomalies  as  identified  by  Barrick  were  in  the  Esperança  South  target  and  the  Esperança  Center  target.  Esperança  South 
anomaly was 2.5 km long and 0.8 km wide with gold assays higher than 100 ppb (“parts per billion”) gold. The soil anomaly in  the 
Esperança Center target was also 2.5 km long and 0.8 km wide but with gold assays higher than 250 ppb. These two anomalies both 
run  north-south  and  are  located  in  the  same  trend,  being  split  only  by  the  existence  of  a  narrow  valley  between  them.  Most  of  the 
Barrick trenches and drill-holes (22 holes) were located in the Esperança South target, and only one (1) hole was drilled in Esperança 
Center. Of the 23 holes drilled, 11 are vertical and 16 have an average depth of about 50 meters. 
 
C. Infrastructure Considerations 
 
Existing infrastructure for CDS is considered good for an early stage exploration project located in northern Brazil. 
 
Specifically, it has:
 
 
 



a fully functional exploration camp is on-site; 
the camp is serviced by a  550 meter airstrip adequate for small aircraft; 
the property is accessible by a 30 km all-weather road from the nearby village of Castelo de Sonhos; 
the  village  of  Castello  de  Sonhos  (population  circa  10,000)  offers  many  services  including  banks,  medical  facilities, 
supermarkets, restaurants, hotels and light and heavy vehicle repair facilities; 
the village of Castelo de Sonhos is located on a paved highway (BR -163) affording ground access  to nearby cities and port 
facilities; and 
a 138 kv power line parallels state highway BR-163.
D. Previous Exploration Activity by Tristar Gold  
 
From December 2010 through June 2014, the Company completed the construction of a camp, worked at Esperança Center, Esperança 
South and other targets involving the collection and assaying of 7,529 soil samples, conducted geological mapping over 4,016 points 
with  geological  descriptions,  completed  an  airborne  geophysical  survey  and  completed  16,213  meters  of  core  drilling  in  144  drill 
holes. The geochemical soil sampling was conducted to confirm Barrick’s results, to identify new targets and to prepare sites for the 
drilling  campaign  which  the  Company  started  in  September,  2011.  In  2011,  an  airborne  geophysical  survey  (magnetometry  and
3
radiometry), was flown by Fugro-Lasa Brazil, covering a total of 7,019 linear kilometers in two contiguous blocks encompassing the 
entire mineral rights area.  
 
The soil geochemistry sampling program performed by the Company at CDS confirmed the previous results obtained by Barrick and 
has not only extended the anomalous zones, but also identified new anomalous zones with the discoveries of the Esperança East and 
West anomalies.  The Esperança East anomaly  has been identified to the East of Esperança Center and is 2,000  meters long by 800 
meters wide (gold assays higher than 100 ppb and with a maximum value of 1,617 ppb).  Also, a narrower soil anomaly, which was 
only suggested by Barrick’s sampling survey, has been better defined with the continuation of the soil sampling being carried out. This 
anomaly, named Esperança West, extends for approximately 4,000 meters with an average width of 400-500 meters and highest gold 
assays between 250 ppb and 422 ppb.  At CDS the  main conglomerate package,  which is the host for the gold  mineralization, has a 
horseshoe shape surface expression which extends for approximately 16 kilometers. The continuing exploration performed by TriStar 
has  expanded  the  gold-in-soil  anomalies  to  a  total  length  of  approximately  18  kilometers  coincident  with  the  outcropping 
conglomerates. 
 
The  Company  contracted  Layne-Christensen  do  Brasil  Ltda.  to  conduct  a  three  phase  drilling  program  of  16,213  meters  of  core 
drilling to test the Esperança Center and Esperança South geochemical anomalies along with the newly discovered Esperança East and 
Esperança  West  targets.  The  first  drilling  campaign  (33  holes  for  5,663  meters)  started  in  September  2011  and  was  completed  on 
February 2012. The second phase drilling campaign (60 holes for 6,440 meters) started in July 2012 and was completed in November 
2012.  The  third  phase  drilling  campaign  (51  holes  for  4,110  meters)  started  in  April  2014  and  was  completed  in  June  2014.  Total 
drilling in the three campaigns amounted to 16,213.20 meters distributed as follow:
  Esperança South target; 103 holes; 9,565 meters 
  Esperança Center target; 34 holes; 5,667 meters 
  Esperança East target; 5 holes; 588 meters 
  Esperança West target; 2 holes; 394 meters
The significant assays for all holes have been disclosed in the news releases of February 27, 2012; April 10, 2012; October 02, 2012, 
November 13, 2012; January 07, 2013; June 11, 2014 and July 09, 2014 (all are filed on sedar). 
 
The  principal  goals  for  the  drilling  at  the  Esperança  South  and  Esperança  Center  targets  were  to  add  more  drill  holes in  previously 
drilled sections and to fill in and extend the drilling grid in these target areas. The drill holes at Esperança East and Esperança West 
were the first investigative holes in these targets. 
 
At Esperança South, the drilling was focused on extending the known mineralization along strike as well down dip. At this target, the 
Company has already drilled 103 holes along a 2,800 meters long drilling line  which  follows the strike of the soil anomaly and the 
open cuts worked by the local garimpeiros. Mineralization at Esperança South is still open to the South and to the  North, where the 
known mineralization has a strike length of 2,800 meters inside a soil geochemistry anomaly that extends for over 5,500 meters. The 
current spacing between the traverse drilling lines, range from 50 meters to 100 meters. 
 
At the Esperança Center target, 34 holes have been drilled to date to investigate a 2,500 meters long by 800 meters wide soil anomaly. 
Here the drilling campaigns were designed to fill in the grid, which has drilling lines spaced from 200 meters to 400 meters and also in 
a fence-like pattern, to follow mineralization along the cross-sections. At Esperança Center, the current results enhance the previous 
drilling results, and a  mineralized zone of approximately 1,000 meters has  now been defined at this target. The  strong geochemical 
anomaly continues further north for at least another 1,500 meters and further drilling will be planned for this area. 
 
The  new  anomaly  named  Esperança  East  (to  the  East  of  Esperança  Center)  is  2,000  meters  long  by  800  meters  wide  and  its  gold 
assays range from 100 ppb to 1,617 ppb. At this target the initial drilling results on five holes are encouraging and additional drilling is 
needed to better define the mineralization. At Esperança West, the drilling aims to investigate its soil anomaly as well a magnetic high 
anomaly identified by the airborne survey and one of the two holes drilled shows positive results.  
 
During the second quarter of 2014 the Company completed a total of 4,110 meters of infill drilling as part of a campaign designed to 
demonstrate sufficient economic potential for converting one of its exploration licenses to an exploitation license.  Due to the  success 
of the drill program, the Company filed a positive report with the DNPM in Brazil on July 31, 2014.  
 
E. The 2014 N.I. 43-101 Technical Report  
 
On  August  18,  2014,  the  Company  announced  the  results  of  its  maiden  NI  43-101  Resource  Estimate,  later  filed  on  SEDAR  on 
October  1,  2014,  completed  by  RBM  Consultoria  Mineral  Ltda.  of  Saquarema,  Brazil.  This  report  calculated  a  mineral  resource  of 
182,000  Indicated  and  98,000  Inferred  ounces  of  gold  in  the  Esperança  South  and  Esperança  Center  zones  as  set  out  in  the  table 
below.

The  resource  estimate  was  calculated  to  an  average  vertical  depth  of  only  70  meters  and  the  area  covering  the  resource  estimate 
represents  only  approximately  4  linear  kilometers  of  the  16  linear  kilometers  of  the  gold  anomaly  area  which  is  currently  under 
exploration. None of the exploration holes were drilled through the entire conglomerate bed. 
 
The resource is hosted in conglomerate horizons along the shallow dipping (30°) east flank of a 10 km basin with a maximum width of 
7km.  The same conglomerate horizon varying in width from 100 to 200 meters at surface, outcrops along the East, North and West 
flanks of this basin and are, in all instances, associated with strong gold in soil anomalies along the 16km strike length. 
 
Preliminary metallurgical testing indicates promising high recovery rates. The testing shows gravity recoveries  of 73% and 88.6% for 
size fractions of respectively 80% passing 150 microns (100 mesh) and 80% passing 53 microns (270 mesh). Through cyanidation  of 
the gravity rejects, the recovery was increased to 95.9% and 99.6% respectively for the two size fractions. Another test was performed 
on  column  cyanide  leaching  on  2  mm  crushed  samples  with  an  average  recovery  of  78.7%  which  could  indicate  the  possibility  of 
recovery by heap leaching or vat leaching.

Bom Jardim (Brazil) 
 
The Bom Jardim project is located approximately 30 km north-east of the Crepori river mouth along the Tapajós river. Bom Jardim is 
a circular structure suggesting a large volcanic caldera. The geology of the area is composed of intermediate-acid volcanic rocks of the 
Uatumã Tectono-Magmatic event (1,900-1,882 Ma). The volcanic rocks are rhyodacites and latites of the Bom Jardim Formation and 
dacites  and  rhyolites  of  the  Salustiano  Formation.    TriStar  Gold  has  retained  one  exploration  license  for  the  Bom  Jardim  area 
measuring a total of 8,829 hectares. 
 
No work is planned on Bom Jardim in 2016. For a description of the work performed by the Company in the past on the Bom Jardim 
property please refer to the MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2015, which is filed on SEDAR,
Overall performance for the Quarter ended June 30, 2016
During  the  quarter  ended  June  30,  2016,  management's  efforts  focused  on  re-logging  the  core  at  CDS  and  planning  for  the  drilling 
campaign that is expected to commence in September. Also during the quarter management of the Company expended considerable 
time on advancing the private placement which was completed in July.

  Change in cash and cash equivalents is closely correlated with changes in shareholders' equity because the sale of common
stock is the Company's sole means of raising capital at present;
  The Company has no operating activities and therefore is unlikely to report positive earnings from operations; 
  As  discussed  below  the  main  factors  impacting  earnings  are  general  and  administrative  expenditures,  expensing  of  stock
options and changes in the fair value of warrants liability (see the discussion below for further details on these trends); and 
  The Company capitalizes expenditures at its mineral properties which is largely responsible for any increase in total assets.
Summary of Quarterly Results
The  following  table  includes  selected  quarterly  financial  information  of  the  Company  and  is  derived  from  unaudited  interim 
consolidated  financial  statements  prepared  by  management  and  the  Company’s  audited  consolidated  financial  statements  for  the 
periods reported. The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS. All amounts are reported in 
000's of US dollars.  
 
The Company  is an exploration stage junior  mining company. It  has  no operations in production and  no  source of sales or revenue 
from  operations.  It  relies  on  funding  its  activities  largely  from  the  sale  of  its  equity.  In  accordance  with  International  Financial 
Reporting  Standards,  the  Company  capitalizes  all  expenditures  made  on  its  resource  properties.  As  such  there  are  only  a  few 
significant  items  which  impact  its  results  from  operations.  These  items  include  the  on-going  level  of  general  and  administrative 
spending which, in accordance with IFRS may include the non-cash cost of stock options granted. A second major item affecting its 
results from operations is the change in warrants liabilities. Warrants liability changes are most significantly affected by changes in the 
Company's  trading  price  of  its  common  shares,  by  the  change  in  the  United  States  and  Canadian  dollar  exchange  rate  because  the 
Company  reports  its  financial  statements  in  US  dollars  whereas  the  exercise  price  of  the  Company's  warrants  and  its  underlying 
common  stock  are  traded  and  priced  in  Canadian  dollars  ("Can$")  and  by  the  number  of  warrants  outstanding  (a  change  caused  by 
warrants being exercised and/or some warrants expiring unexercised).  
 
Significant  variances  in  the  Company’s  reported  income  (loss)  from  quarter  to  quarter  most  commonly  arise  from  those  factors 
described above and they are difficult to anticipate in advance or to predict from past results. These factors include: (i) the vesting of 
incentive  stock  options,  which  results  in  the  recording  of  amounts  for  share-based  compensation  expense,  and  (ii)  the  periodical 
valuation at fair value of warrants liabilities, which results in the recording of amounts for warrant liability fair value change. Both of 
these amounts may be quite large in relation to other general and administrative expenses incurred in any given quarter or fiscal year.

The net income for the second fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016, was $675,621 or $0.01 per share compared to a loss of $2,873 or 
$(0.00) per share for the second fiscal quarter of 2015. The main difference was that in the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company 
recorded a large gain on the fair value of the warrant liability which was a result of a decrease in the Company's share price between 
March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016 and a strengthening of  the US dollar against the Canadian dollar (which  means that the  warrant 
liability  when  translated  from  Canadian  dollars  to  United  States  dollars  was  reduced).  The  warrant  liability  is  fair  valued  using  the 
Black-Scholes option pricing model and is initially measured in Canadian dollars which is then translated to the functional currency of 
the  Company  which  is  US  dollars.  Management  continues  to  defer  salary  compensation.  Details  of  general  and  administrative 
spending are discussed in more detail below.

Significant  factors  which  impacted  expenses  for  the  quarter  ended  June  30,  2016,  compared  to  the  quarter  ended  June  30,  2015, 
include the following:
  Consulting fees decreased because during the second quarter of 2015 the Company granted stock options to a public relations
advisory firm;
  The decrease in depreciation is because a number of assets are fully depreciated and the Company has refrained from adding
to its plant and equipment basis for a number of years;
  Travel has increased because of more frequent visits to the CDS property in Brazil and attendance at more investor functions; 
  Professional fees increased because the Company employed a  consultant to assist in the preparation of the new N.I. 43-101
and to assist in planning the 2016 CDS drill program;
  The large increase in salaries and benefits is almost entirely attributable to the accrual of certain executive salaries which are
being accrued but not paid; and
  The Company has brought in-house most of the work related to shareholder relations.

The net loss for the six month period ended June 30, 2016 was $(2,194,967) or $(0.02) per share compared to a loss of $(83,341) or 
$(0.00) per share for the six month period ended June 30, 2015. The main difference was that in the six month period ended June 30, 
2016, the Company recorded a large loss on the fair value of the warrant liability which was a result of a significant increase in the 
Company's share price for the most recent six month reporting period. In addition, the other significant matter is the increase in G&A 
period  over  period.  This  increase  is  due  to  the  accrual  of  management  salaries  in  2016.  Management  continued  to  defer  salary 
compensation to the end of June 2016.  Further information concerning general and administrative expenditures are discussed in more 
detail below.

Significant factors which impacted expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, include 
the following:
8
  Consulting fees decreased because in 2016 there were no stock option grants to directors (Company directors do not receive
cash remuneration for their work as a director);
  The change in the provision was largely a function of the Brazilian real strengthening during the recent quarter; 
  Travel has increased for the reasons previously discussed; 
  Professional fees increased because the Company employed a consultant to assist in the preparation of the new N.I. 43-101
and to assist in planning the 2016 CDS drill program;
  The large increase in salaries and benefits is almost entirely attributable to the accrual of certain executive salaries which are
being accrued but not paid; and
  The  Company  has  increase  its  participation  at  a  number  of  industry  investor  conferences  and  spent  considerable  effort  in
revamping its shareholder information (i.e. website and investor information packages).
Income from Operations 
 
The Company  has  not received any revenues from  mining operations since inception.    During the quarter ended  June 30, 2016, the 
Company received an immaterial amount of interest income from invested cash balances. 
 
Impact of Inflation 
 
The  Company  has  no  source  of  revenue  and  therefore  inflation  effects  relate  primarily  to  the  exploration  costs  in  Brazil  which  are 
affected by both worldwide and country specific inflationary trends. In  addition, as country specific inflation impact relative foreign 
exchange rates, then inflation in Brazil compared to inflation in the US may impact the relative value of the Brazilian real compared to 
the US dollar which would impact the reported US dollar cost of doing business in Brazil. 
 
Trend Information 
 
The  cyclical  nature  of  the  prices  of  metals,  particularly  the  price  of  gold,  is  reasonably  likely  to  have  an  effect  on  the  Co mpany’s 
liquidity  and  capital  resources.    If  the  price  of  gold  or  the  worldwide  demand  for  gold  decreases,  there  would  likely  be  an  adverse 
effect on the Company’s ability to raise additional funding or to attract exploration partners for its properties.
Financial Condition: Liquidity and Capital Resources.
The Company has properties that have not yet proven to be developable due to the limited mineral resource currently estimated, and 
has  no  revenues  from  mining  operations.  The  rights  and  interests  in  the  Castelo  de  Sonhos  and  Bom  Jardim  properties  in  Brazil 
constitute the  Company's current  mineral holdings.   The Company's future financial success  will depend on the discovery of one or 
more economic mineral deposits. This process can take many years, can consume significant financial resources and is largely based 
on  factors  that  are  beyond  the  control  of  the  Company  and  its  management.  The  Company  has  implemented  cash  conservation 
measures  and  continues  to  review  any  and  all  opportunities  for  further  reductions  in  expenditures.  The  majority  of  the  Company's 
financial  commitments  are  related  to  property  payments  and  the  level  of  exploration  activity  in  Brazil  and  for  continuing  the 
Company's financial reporting requirements.  
 
On  May  6,  2015,  the  Company  reached  an  agreement  with  the  vendor  of  the  CDS  property  under  which  the  final  payment  of 
$1,500,000, originally due in  July 2015 has been extended with payments of $500,000 paid in July 2015, $300,000  paid in January 
2016 and $800,000 was paid in July 2016.  The Company also issued 1,000,000 shares of TriStar to the vendor in July 2016.  
  
The  Company  requires  additional  funding  in  2016  to  enhance  its  exploration  activities  at  the  CDS  property  and  is  in  the 
process of attempting to obtain this funding. The amount the Company is seeking to raise is between $2.5 and $4.0 million.  
 
To  date,  the  Company  has  financed  its  activities  by  the  private  placement  of  equity  securities.  In  order  to  continue  funding  their 
exploration activities and corporate costs, exploration companies are usually reliant on their ongoing ability to raise financing through 
the  sale  of  equity.  This  is  dependent  on  positive  investor  sentiment,  which  in  turn  is  influenced  by  a  positive  climate  for  the 
commodities that are being explored for, the company's track record, and the experience and caliber of its management. 
 
In July the Company completed a private placement raising  gross proceeds of Can$4.256  million  which funds  were  used in July  to 
make the final scheduled payment of $800,000 to the vendors of the CDS property and for general working capital requirements. 
 
The Company will seek additional equity financing during 2016 in the amount and  for the purposes previously discussed. If 
additional equity is not available, the Company may seek exploration partners to assist in funding acquisition or exploration 
efforts.  The  Company  has  historically  been  able  to  successfully  raise  capital  as  required  for  its  business  needs;  however,  no 
assurances can be made by the Company that it can continue to raise debt or equity capital in the future.
9
On  June  30,  2016,  the  Company  had  a  working  capital  deficit  of  $219,886  which  included  $857,066  in  cash  and  cash  equivalents 
compared to working capital of $605,162 including $1,081,011 in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015.  
 
Mineral Properties and Deferred Expenditures   
 
During  the  second  fiscal  quarter  ended  June  30,  2016,  the  Company  incurred  $104,642  in  exploration  expenses  related  to  the 
Company’s  CDS  property  (2015  second  quarter  spending  at  CDS  was  $66,257).  The  year  to  date  spending  at  CDS  is  $490,542  of 
which $300,000 was for acquisition costs. To June 30, 2015, the Company had expended $132,115 in exploration spending at CDS.  
 
The  Company’s  total  mineral  properties  and  deferred  expenditures  increased  to  $12,337,635 at  June  30, 2016,  from  $11,847,093  at 
December 31, 2015, as a result of property payments and exploration work at CDS. Spending at Bom Jardim in 2016 was $nil because 
the Company allocated what cash was available to the more advanced CDS property.
Risks and Uncertainties
An  investment  in  the  Company's  common  shares  is  highly  speculative  and  subject  to  a  number  of  risks.  Additional  risks  that  the 
Company  is  unaware  of  or  that  are  currently  believed  to  be  immaterial  may  become  important  factors  that  affect  the  Company's 
business.  If  any  of  the  following  risks  occur,  or  if  others  occur,  the  Company's  business,  operating  results  and  financial  condition 
could be adversely impacted. 
 
The Company is in the mineral property acquisition, exploration and development business and is exposed to a number of operational, 
financial, regulatory and other risks and uncertainties that are typical in the natural resource industry and common to other companies 
of like size and stage of development. These risks may not be the only risks faced by the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties 
not presently known or considered immaterial by the Company could adversely impact the company's business, results of operation, 
and financial performance in future years. 
 
The Company's business plan is to acquire additional exploration prospects, continue exploration activities on its current projects, and, 
if warranted, undertake development and mining operations, and this plan is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the 
following: 
 
General economic and financial market conditions 
 
Since mid 2008, there has been heightened global economic uncertainty, increase financial and commodity market volatility, slower 
economic growth, reduced investor confidence, greater shareholder and other stakeholder activism, bank  failures and  reduced credit 
availability. These economic events have had a negative effect on commodity markets which has secondarily impacted participants in 
the  mining  and  exploration  industries.  This  macro-environment  may  impact  the  ability  of  the  Company  to  raise  financing  and/or 
implement its exploration and development plans. 
 
Metal price risk 
 
The  price  of  gold  significantly  affects  the  value  of  the  Company's  own  securities  and  investments  and  the  recoverable  value  of  its 
exploration projects and its ability to raise financing. 
 
Geo-political Risk 
 
The Company’s exploration properties are located in Brazil and it has no  country diversification  with respect to its principal assets. 
Therefore, any political or social disruptions unique to Brazil would have a material impact on the operations of the Company and its 
financial  performance  and  stability.  Additionally,  the  Company's  projects  are  subject  to  the  laws  of  Brazil  and  can  be  negatively 
impacted by the existing laws and regulations of that country, as they apply to mineral exploration, land ownership, royalty interests 
and taxation, and by any potential changes of such laws and regulations. 
 
Properties  in  which  the  Company  has  an  interest  are  located  in  the  Amazon  Basin  in  Brazil,  which  may  be  of  particular  interest  or 
sensitivity  to  one  or  more  special  interest  groups.    Consequently,  mineral  exploration  and  mining  activities  in  those  areas  may  be 
affected  in  varying  degrees  by  political  uncertainty,  expropriations  of  property  and  changes  in  applicable  government  policies  and 
regulation  such  as  business  laws,  environmental  laws,  land  claims  entitlements  or  procedures  and  mineral  rights  and  mining  laws 
affecting the Company’s business in that area.  Any changes in regulations or shifts in political conditions are beyond the control or 
influence  of  the  Company  and  may  adversely  affect  its  business,  or  if  significant  enough,  may  result  in  the  impairment  or  loss  o f 
mineral  concessions  or  other  mineral  rights,  or  may  make  it  impossible  to  continue  its  mineral  exploration  and  mining  activities  in 
such areas.
10
Exploration and Development Stage Risk  
 
Exploration for mineral resources involves a high degree of risk, the cost of conducting exploration programs may be substantial and 
the probability of success is difficult to assess. 
 
Resource exploration and development is a highly speculative business, characterized by a number of significant risks including, but 
not  limited  to,  unprofitable  efforts  resulting  not  only  from  the  failure  to  discover  minerals  deposits  but  also  from  finding  mineral 
deposits  that,  though  present,  are  insufficient  in  size  and  quality  to  justify  development  or  if  developed  generate  profits  and  cash 
flows. Few exploration projects successfully achieve development due to factors that cannot be predicted or anticipated and even one 
unexpected  factor  may  result  in  the  economic  viability  of  the  project  being  detrimentally  impacted  such  that  the  project  cannot  be 
developed  or  operations  continue.  The  Company  closely  monitors  its  activities  and  those  factors  that  could  negatively  impact  them 
and  the  Company's  employees  and  its  advisors  assist  in  risk  management  and  to  make  timely  decisions  regarding  future  property 
expenditures. 
 
Other risks associated with projects in the exploration and development stage which could cause delays or prohibit the advancement of 
the project including delays in obtaining required government approvals and permits and the inability to obtain suitable or adequate 
machinery, equipment, access, power or labor. 
 
It  is  impossible  to  ensure  that  the  current  development  programs  planned  by  the  Company  will  result  in  a  profitable  commercial 
mining  operation.  Mineral  deposits  and  production  costs  are  affected  by  such  factors  as  environmental  permitting  regulations  and 
requirements,  weather,  environmental  factors,  foreign  exchange  changes,  inflation,  unforeseen  technical  difficulties,  unusual  or 
unexpected geological formations and work interruptions.   
 
Need for Additional Funding 
 
Additional  funding  is  required  by  the  Company  to  continue  as  a  going  concern.  The  Company  is  in  the  process  of  trying  to  raise 
additional  cash  through  the  sale  of  its  common  stock  or  some  alternative  arrangement.    However,  there  is  no  guarantee  that  the 
Company  will  be  able  to  raise  sufficient  funds  to  meet  existing  and  future  obligations  such  as  future  general  and  administrative 
expenditures  (circa  $3  million  per  year)  and  management's  plans  for  advancing  exploration  at  CDS  (estimated  at  between 
approximately $2.5 million to $4.0 million in 2016). 
 
The inability of the Company to raise further equity financing could adversely affect the Company's business plan, including its ability 
to acquire additional properties and perform exploration activities on, and maintain its ownership of existing properties. 
 
Title to Properties  
 
The Company cannot guarantee title to all of its  properties as the properties may be subject to prior mineral rights applications with 
priority, prior unregistered agreements or transfers or indigenous peoples' land claims, and title may be affected by undetected defects.  
Certain of the mineral rights held by the Company are held under applications for mineral rights or are subject to renewal applications 
and,  until  final  approval  of  such  applications  is  received,  the  Company's  rights  to  such  mineral  rights  may  not  materialize  and  the 
exact  boundaries  of  the  Company's  properties  may  be  subject  to  adjustment.  The  Company  does  not  maintain  title  insurance  on  its 
properties.  
 
Environmental Laws 
 
The exploration programs conducted by the Company are subject to national, state and/or local regulations regarding environmental 
considerations in the jurisdiction where they are located.  Most operations involving exploration or production activities are subject to 
existing  laws  and  regulations  relating  to  exploration  and  mining  procedures,  reclamation,  safety  precautions,  employee  health  and 
safety, air quality standards, pollution of stream and fresh water sources, odor, noise, dust, and other environmental protection controls 
adopted by federal, state and local governmental authorities as well as the rights of adjoining property owners.  The Company may be 
required  to  prepare  and  present  to  federal,  state  or  local  authorities  data  pertaining  to  the  effect  or  impact  that  any  proposed 
exploration  or  production  of  minerals  may  have  upon  the  environment.    All  requirements  imposed  by  any  such  authorities  may  be 
costly, time consuming, and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production operations.   
 
Operating Hazards and Risks 
 
The  Company's  operations  are  subject  to  hazards  and  risks  normally  associated  with  the  exploration  and  development  of  mineral 
properties,  any  of  which  could  cause  delays  in  the  progress  of  the  Company's  exploration  and  development  plans,  damage  or 
destruction of property, loss of life and/or environmental damage. Some of these risks include, but are not limited to, unexpected or 
unusual  geological  formations,  rock  bursts,  cave-ins,  flooding,  fires,  earthquakes;  unanticipated  changes  in  metallurgical
11
characteristics  and  mineral  recovery;  unanticipated  ground  or  water  conditions;  industrial  or  labor  disputes;  hazardous  weather 
conditions; cost overruns; land claims; and other unforeseen events. A combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation 
may not be able to overcome these risks. 
 
The  nature  of  these  risks  is  such  that  liabilities  may  exceed  any  insurance  policy  limits,  the  liabilities  and  hazards  might  not  be 
insurable or the  Company  might  elect to not insure itself against such liabilities due to excess premium costs or other factors. Such 
liabilities may have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and operations and could reduce or eliminate any 
future profitability and result in increased costs and a decline in the value of the securities of the Company. 
 
Competition  
 
The  mineral  industry  is  intensely  competitive  in  all  its  phases.  The  Company  competes  with  many  companies  possessing  greater 
financial  resources  and  technical  facilities  than  itself  for  the  acquisition  of  mineral  concessions,  claims,  leases  and  other  mineral 
interests as well as for the recruitment and retention of qualified employees. 
 
Potential Dilution to Existing Shareholders   
 
The  Company  will  require  additional  financing  in  order  to  complete  full  exploration  of  its  mineral  properties.  The  Company 
anticipates  that  it  may  sell  additional  equity  securities  including,  but  not  limited  to,  its  common  stock,  share  purchase  warrants  or 
some  form  of  convertible  security.  The  effect  of  additional  issuances  of  equity  securities  will  result  in  dilution  to  existing 
shareholders. 
 
Insurance Coverage 
 
Mineral exploration is subject to risks of human injury, environmental and legal liability and loss of assets.  The Company may elect 
to not have insurance for certain risks because of the high premiums associated with insuring those risks or, in some cases, insurance 
may  not  be  available  for  certain  risks.    Occurrence  of  events  for  which  the  Company  is  not  insured  could  have  a  material  adverse 
effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations. 
 
Key Executives    
 
The  Company's  operations  require  employees,  consultants,  advisors  and  contractors  with  a  high  degree  of  specialized  technical, 
management  and  professional  skills,  such  as  engineers,  trades  people,  geologists  and  equipment  operators.  The  Company  competes 
both locally and internationally for such professionals. If the Company is unable to acquire the talents it seeks then it could experience 
higher operating costs, poorer results and an overall lack of success in implementing its business plans. 
 
The  Company  is  dependent  on  the  services  of  key  senior  executives  and  certain  other  vice-presidents  and  advisors.    Each  of  these 
executives  has  many  years  of  background  in  the  mining  industry.    The  Company  may  not  be  able  to  replace  that  experience  and 
knowledge with other individuals which may result in a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operation and 
financial performance.

Financial Instruments
Non‐derivative financial assets 
 
The  Company  recognizes  all  financial  assets  initially  at  fair  value  and  classifies  them  into  one  of  the  following  four  categories: 
held‐to‐maturity,  available‐for‐sale  (“AFS”),  loans  and  receivables  or  other  financial  assets,  or  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss 
(“FVTPL”).  Financial  instruments  held  to  maturity  and  loans  and  receivables  are  measured  at  amortized  cost.  Available‐for‐sale 
instruments are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). Instruments 
classified as FVTPL are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in net income (loss). 
   
The  fair  value  of  financial  instruments  traded  in  active  markets  (such  as  FVTPL  and  AFS  securities)  are  based  on  quoted  market 
prices at the date of the statement of financial position.  
 
The  Company  has  classified  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  receivables  as  loans  and  receivables.  The  fair  value  of  cash  and  cash 
equivalents  and  accounts  receivable  are  approximated  by  their  carrying  value  due  to  the  short  term  nature  of  these  financial 
instruments.  
 
Non‐derivative financial liabilities 
 
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at FVTPL or other financial liabilities. Financial liabilities classified as 
FVTPL are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in the statement of comprehensive income (loss). Other 
financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value net of transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortized cost. 
 
Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and provisions are classified as other financial liabilities.  The fair value of accounts payable 
and accrued liabilities are approximated by their carrying value due to the short term nature of these financial instruments.
13
Derivative instruments 
 
Derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on initial recognition and at each subsequent reporting period. Any gains or losses 
arising from changes in fair value on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded in net income or loss. 
 
The Company’s share purchase  warrants  with exercise prices in  Canadian dollars are derivative liabilities and accordingly, they are 
recorded at fair value at each reporting period, with the gains or losses recorded in the statement net income or loss.
Financial Instruments and Management of Financial Risk
The Company is exposed to potential loss from various risks including currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, market risk and 
commodity price risk. 
 
Market Risks 
 
The significant market risks to which the Company is exposed include commodity price risk, foreign exchange risk and interest rate 
risk. 
 
Credit Risk 
 
Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a 
financial loss. At June 30, 2016, the financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash and cash 
equivalents,  and  accounts  receivable.    The  Company  invests  any  excess  cash  balances  in  short-term,  highly  liquid  and  highly-rated 
financial instruments such as cash and short-term guaranteed deposits, all held with financial institutions in Canadian and the United 
State. Management considers that its exposure to credit risk is low. 
 
Liquidity Risk 
 
Liquidity risk is the risk that  the Company  will encounter difficulty in  meeting its financial obligations associated  with its accounts 
payable and accrued liabilities. 
 
The Company attempts to manage liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents balances.  Liquidity requirements 
are  managed based on expected cash  flow to ensure there is sufficient capital to  meet short-term obligations.  At June  30, 2016, the 
Company  had  cash  and  cash  equivalents  of  $857,066 and  accounts  payable  and  accrued  liabilities  of  $818,748  (of  which  $222,559 
was for private placement subscription funds received prior to closing). The Company anticipates that it will need to obtain additional 
financing in 2016 to fund planned exploration work at CDS.  
 
Commodity Price Risk 
 
The Company’s ability to raise capital to fund exploration or development activities is subject to risk associated with fluctuations in 
the market price of gold. The Company does not have any properties in production and therefore has no sales revenue or cash flow 
from operations. Nor does it undertake any hedging or other commodity price management techniques. 
 
The  international  price  of  gold  has  historically  fluctuated  widely  and  is  affected  by  numerous  factors  outside  of  the  Company’s 
control, including, but not limited to, levels of worldwide production, short-term changes in supply and demand, industrial and retail 
demand, central bank lending, the relative strength of the US dollar vis a  vis other currencies, the monetary policies of governments 
and forward sales by producers and speculators.  The Company does not actively manage its gold price risk. 
 
Interest Rate Risk 
 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash flows of a financial instrument  will fluctuate because of changes in 
market  interest  rates.  In  respect  of  financial  assets,  the  Company’s  policy  is  to  invest  cash  at  variable  rates  of  interest  in  cash 
equivalents, in order to maintain liquidity, while achieving a low risk market return. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on 
its  short‐term  investments  which  are  included  in  cash  and  cash  equivalents.  The  short‐term  investment  interest  earned  is  based  on 
prevailing  one  to  90  days  market  interest  rates  which  may  fluctuate.  The  Company  has  not  entered  into  any  derivative  contracts  to 
manage this risk.  
 
Currency risk
14
The Company operates in United States of America, Canada, and Brazil. As a result, the Company has foreign currency exposure  with 
respect  to  items  not  denominated  in  United  States  dollars.  The  three  main  types  of  foreign  exchange  risk  of  the  Company  can  be 
categorized as follows: 
 
Transaction exposure 
 
The  Company  operates  and  incurs  costs  in  three  main  currencies;  the  US  dollar,  the  Canadian  dollar  and  the  Brazilian  real.  This 
creates exposure at the operational level, which may affect the Company’s profitability as exchange rates fluctuate. The Company has 
not hedged its exposure to currency fluctuations. 
 
Translation exposure  
 
A strengthening of the U.S. dollar by 10% against the Canadian dollar and the Brazilian Real at June 30, 2016, with all other variables 
held  constant  would  have  decreased  the  Company’s  before  tax  net  loss  by  approximately  $273,000  (at  June  30,  2015  would  have 
decreased the Company’s before tax net loss by approximately $172,000) as a result of a change in value of the financial assets and 
liabilities denominated in those currencies. 
 
Exposure to currency risk 
 
The Company is exposed to currency risk through the following assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the United 
States dollar: cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivables, prepaid expenses, accounts payables and other liabilities, provisions and 
warrants liability. The currencies of the Company’s financial instruments and other foreign currency denominated liabilities, based on 
notional amounts, were as follows:
Cash and cash equivalents
Accounts receivable
Prepaid expenses 
Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
Provisions
Warrants liability

Other price risk 
 
Other price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
prices other than those arising from interest rate risk,  financial  market risk or currency  risk.  As at  June 30, 2016, the Company  has 
negligible other price risk.
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is the price that  would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction bet ween market 
participants  at  the  measurement  date.  Fair  values  are  determined  directly  by  reference  to  published  price  quotations  in  an  active 
market, when available, or by using a valuation technique that uses inputs observed from relevant markets. 
 
The fair value hierarchy categorizes into three levels the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
  Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities that the entity can
access at the measurement date.
  Level 2 inputs are quoted prices in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, 
inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly (for example, interest 
rate and yield curves observable at commonly quoted interval and volatility measurements used to value option contracts), or 
inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data or other means.
15
  Level 3 inputs are prices or valuation  techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the  fair value  measurement
and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).
The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.  
 
As at June 30, 2016, the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows:
Level 1

Related party transactions are in the normal course of operations and are measured at the exchange amount, which is the amount of 
consideration established and agreed to by the related parties and the Board of Directors.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The following are critical judgments and key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the 
statement of financial position date that management has made in applying the Company’s accounting policies which have the most 
significant  effect  on  the  amounts  recognized  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  a  significant  risk  of  causing  a  material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year:  
 
Going concern 
 
Management considers whether there exists any event(s) or condition(s) that may cast doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.  Considerations take into account all available information about the future including the availability of debt and equity 
financing as well as the Company’s working capital balance and future commitments. 
 
Functional currency  
 
The functional currency of each of the Company’s entities  is  measured using the currency of the primary economic environment  in 
which that entity operates. The functional currency of all entities within  the group is the United States dollar. Functional currency of 
each of the entities was determined based on the currency that mainly influences sales prices for goods and services, labor,  material 
and other costs and the currency in which funds from financing activities are generated.  
 
Impairment of assets  
 
Management assesses each cash-generating unit at each reporting period to determine whether any indication of impairment exists.  In 
addition, management assesses a cash-generating unit for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
value may not be recoverable.  Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount is made which is 
considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. These assessments require the use of estimates and 
assumptions such as future capital requirements and assessments of preliminary assay results. Fair value is determined as the amount 
that would be obtained from the sale of the asset in an arm’s-length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties.  
 
Fair value of derivative financial instruments  
 
Management assesses the fair value of the Company’s financial derivatives in accordance with the accounting policy stated in  Note 4 
to  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  Fair  values  of  warrants  have  been  measured  using  the  Black-Scholes  model,  taking  into 
account  the  terms  and  conditions  upon  which  the  warrants  are  granted.  These  calculations  require  the  use  of  estimates  and 
assumptions. Changes in assumptions concerning volatilities, interest rates and expected life could have significant impact on the fair 
valuation  attributed  to  the  Company’s  financial  derivatives.  When  these  assumptions  change  or  become  known  in  the  future,  such 
differences will impact asset and liability carrying values in the period in which they change or become known.
At June 30, 2016, the fair value of the Company’s warrants were estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the 
following assumptions:

Management assesses the fair value of stock options granted in accordance with the accounting policy stated in Note 4 to the  audited 
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015. The fair value of the options granted is measured using the 
Black-Scholes  model,  taking  into  account  the  terms  and  conditions  upon  which  the  options  are  granted.    Changes  in  assumptions 
concerning volatilities, interest rates and expected life could have significant impact on the fair valuation attributed to the Company’s 
stock options.
There was no stock option expense for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.

Provisions 
 
Provisions  recognized  in  the  financial  statements  involve  judgments  on  the  occurrence  of  future  events  which  could  result  in  a 
material outlay for the Company. The provision recognized in the accounts of the Company represents a possible tax liability in Brazil 
relating  to  the  termination  of  certain  employees  in  Brazil.  The  Company  cannot  predict  with  any  level  of  certainty  the  amount  or 
timing of this contingent liability, if one exists The changes in the provision reflects changes in foreign exchange rates as the ultimate 
liability, if any, would be payable in the Brazilian Real.

New Accounting Standards and Accounting Standards Not Yet Effective
The  IASB  and  IFRIC  have  issued  the  following  new  and  revised  Standards  and  Interpretations  which  are  not  yet  effective  for  the 
relevant reporting periods.
18
IFRS 9, “Financial instruments” (2014). This is the finalized version of IFRS 9 which contains accounting requirements for financial 
instruments replacing IFRS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. The new standard contains requirements in the 
following areas: 
 
Classification and measurement. Financial assets are classified by reference to the business model within which they are held 
and  their  contractual  cash  flow  characteristics.  The  2014  version  of  IFRS  9  introduces  a  "fair  value  through  other  comprehensive 
income" category  for certain  debt instruments.  Financial  liabilities  are classified in a  manner  similar to that  under IAS 39, however 
there are differences in the requirements applying to the measurement of an entity's own credit risk. 
 
financial assets, so it is no longer necessary for a credit event to have occurred before a credit loss is recognized. 
 
This standard is applicable to the Company for annual periods beginning on July 1, 2018. The Company is evaluating the impact of 
the adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.
Impairment. The 2014 version of IFRS introduces an "expected credit loss" model for the measurement of the impairment of
Derecognition. The requirements for derecognition of financial assets and liabilities are carried forward from IAS 39.
IFRS  15,  “Revenue  from  Contracts  with  Customers”  replaces  IAS  18,  Revenue,  IAS  11,  Construction  Contracts  and  a  number  of 
related interpretations. IFRS 15 establishes a new control-based revenue recognition model, changes the basis for   deciding  when 
revenue is recognized at a point in time or over time, provides new and more detailed guidance on  specific  topics  and  expands  and 
improves disclosures revenue. This standard is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The Company is 
evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.  
 
IFRS 16, Leases was published in January 2016 and supersedes IAS 17- Leases. IFRS 16 specifies how to recognize, measure, present 
and disclose leases. The standard provides a single lease accounting  model, requiring the recognition of assets and liabilities  for all 
leases, unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value. The standard is effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted if IFRS 15 has also been applied. The Company is evaluating the 
impact of the adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company is accumulated 
and  communicated  to  management  as  appropriate  to  allow  timely  decision-making  regarding  required  disclosures.  The  Company's 
CEO and CFO have concluded that information required to be disclosed in the Company's annual and quarterly financial statements 
and the annual and quarterly MD&A have been disclosed and fairly presented as at each reporting date and that processes are in place 
to provide them with sufficient knowledge to support such representation. However, a control system, no matter how well conceived 
and implemented can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Internal control over financial reporting ("ICFR") is intended to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with IFRS. ICFR should include those 
policies and procedures that:
  Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
assets;
  Provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financial  statements  in 
accordance  with  IFRS,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with  the  Company's 
management and Board of Directors; and
  Provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use of, or disposition
of assets that could have a material impact on financial statements.
ICFR cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives due to inherent limitations. ICFR is a process that 
involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to error, collusion, or improper override. Due to such limitations, there is risk 
that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. It is possible to design into the Company's reporting 
process safeguards to reduce, but not entirely eliminate this risk. 
 
The Company's CEO and CFO have concluded, subject to the limitations noted in this MD&A, that as of the date of this report, that 
the Company has sufficient controls that meet the objectives of ICFR as stated above.
Management's Responsibility For Financial Statements
The  Company's  interim  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  for  the  quarter  ended  June  30,  2016,  have  been  prepared  by

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Proposed Transactions
Conflicts of Interest
The Company's directors and officers  may serve as directors and officers, or be associated  with, other reporting companies or have 
significant  shareholdings  of  other  companies.  To  the  extent  that  such  other  companies  may  participate  in  business  or  asset 
acquisitions, dispositions, or ventures in which the Company may participate, the directors and officers of the Company may have a 
conflict of interest in negotiating and concluding on terms with respect to the transaction. If a conflict of interest  arises, the Company 
will follow the provisions of the BC Business Corporations Act ("BCBCA") dealing with conflict of interest. These provisions  state 
that  where  a  director  has  such  a  conflict,  that  person  must  at  a  meeting  of  the  Company's  directors  disclose  his  or  her  interest  and 
refrain from voting on the matter unless otherwise permitted by the BCBCA. In accordance with the laws of the province of British 
Columbia,  the  directors  and  officers  of  TriStar  Gold  are  required  to  act  honestly,  in  good  faith,  and  in  the  best  interests  of  the 
Company.

materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  
Such  factors  include,  among  others,  the  following:  general  economic  and  business  conditions;  competition  within  the  minerals 
industry  to  acquire  properties  of  merit,  and  competition  from  other  companies  possessing  greater  technical  and  financial  resources;

with  securities  regulators.    The  use  in  the  following  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  such  words  as  “believes”,  “plans”, 
“estimates”,  “may”,  “could”,  “would”,  “might”,  ”will”,  “anticipates”,  “expects”,  “intends”  and  similar  expressions  are  intended  to 
identify forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. Material factors and assumptions 
used  to  develop  the  forward-looking  information  include  but  are  not  limited  to,  the  following:  there  will  be  adequate  liquidity 
available  to  the  Company  to  fund  future  operations;  the  Company  will  be  successful  in  raising  addition  capital  in  this  and  future 
periods;  the  actual  exploration  results  will  be  favorable;  exploration  and  development  costs  will  not  exceed  the  Company's 
expectations;  the  Company  will  be  able  to  retain  and  hire  skilled  staff,  all  required  regulatory  and  government  approvals  will  be 
obtained  in  a  timely  manner  on  terms  acceptable  to  the  Company,  applicable  geo-political  conditions  are  favorable  for  future 
investment,  gold  and  commodity  price  and  foreign  exchange  rates  remain  favorable,  no  title  disputes  arise  with  respect  to  the 
Company's properties and the Company will remain in compliance with applicable regulatory and contractual obligations. 
 
These forward-looking statements are based upon the beliefs, expectations, reasonable investigation and opinions of management on 
the date such statements are made.  The success of the Company is dependent on the efforts of the Company, its employees and many 
other factors including, primarily, its ability to raise additional capital and establishing the economic viability of any of its exploration 
properties.

It  is  the  Company's  policies  that  all  forward  looking  statements  are  based  upon  the  Company's  beliefs  and  assumptions  which  are 
based  on  and  derived  from  information  available  to  management  at  the  time  these  assumptions  are  made.  The  forward  looking 
statements contained herein are based upon information available as at the effective date of this MD&A and are subject to change after 
this date. The Company assumes no obligation and has no policy for updating or revising forward looking information or statements to 
reflect new events or circumstances except as may be necessary under applicable securities law. Although management believes that 
the  expectations  represented  by  such  forward-looking  information  or  statements  are  reasonable,  there  is  significant  risk  that  the 
forward looking information or statements may not be achieved and the underlying assumptions thereto will not prove to be accurate. 
Actual  results  or  events  could  differ  materially  from  the  plans,  intentions  and  expectations  expressed  or  implied  in  any  forward 
looking information or statements, including the underlying assumptions thereto, as a result of the numerous risks, uncertainties and 
other factors such as those described above and discussed under Risks and Uncertainties.
