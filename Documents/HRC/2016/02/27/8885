<p><b>Note by the Secretariat

<p>1. In its resolution 9/8 entitled &#8220;Effective implementation of international human rights 
instruments&#8221;, the Human Rights Council requested the Secretary-General to report annually on 
measures taken to implement this resolution and on obstacles to its implementation, including 
recommendations for further improving the effectiveness of, harmonizing, and reforming the 
treaty body system. 
</p>
<p>2. The Secretary-General has submitted to the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session 
the annual report of the chairpersons of human rights treaty bodies, which contains the report on 
their twenty-first meeting, as well as the eighth and ninth inter-committee meeting of human 
rights treaty bodies, and therefore, the latest information available. In view of this, the Secretary-
General requests the Council to postpone to the thirteenth session the submission of the present 
report, so that it would include information on the results of the twenty-first meeting of 
chairpersons of human rights treaty bodies, the eighth and ninth inter-committee meetings and 
the outcome of the tenth inter-committee meeting which will be held in December 2009.
