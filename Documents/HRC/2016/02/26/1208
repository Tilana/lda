<p><b>  26/3  Extreme poverty and human rights 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that, in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
the International Covenants on Human Rights, the ideal of a world in which all human 
beings can enjoy freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created 
whereby everyone may enjoy his or her economic, social and cultural rights, as well as his 
or her civil and political rights, and reaffirming in this regard the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> all previous resolutions on the issue of human rights and extreme 
poverty adopted by the General Assembly, including resolutions 65/214 of 21 December 
2010 and 67/164 of 20 December 2012, and by the Commission on Human Rights, as well 
as relevant Human Rights Council resolutions, including Council resolutions 2/2 of 27 
November 2006, 7/27 of 28 March 2008, 8/11 of 18 June 2008, 12/19 of 2 October 2009, 
15/19 of 30 September 2010, 17/13 of 17 June 2011 and 21/11 of 27 September 2012, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further</i> that, in its resolution 62/205 of 19 December 2007, the General 
Assembly proclaimed the Second United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty 
(2008-2017) in order to support, in an efficient and coordinated manner, the internationally 
agreed development goals relating to poverty eradication, including the Millennium 
Development Goals, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>that, in its resolution 67/164 of 20 December 2012, the General Assembly 
took note with appreciation of the guiding principles on extreme poverty and human rights, 
adopted by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 21/11, as a useful tool for States in 
the formulation and implementation of poverty reduction and eradication policies, as 
appropriate,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> in this regard the commitments made at relevant United Nations 
conferences and summits, including those made at the World Summit for Social 
</p>

<p>Development, held in Copenhagen in 1995, at the Millennium Summit, at which Heads of 
State and Government committed themselves to eradicate extreme poverty and to halve, by 
2015, the proportion of the world&#8217;s people whose income is less than one dollar a day and 
of those who suffer from hunger, and at the 2005 World Summit, and welcoming the 
conclusions of the summit on the Millennium Development Goals, held in New York from 
20 to 22 September 2010, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> that extreme poverty persists in all countries of the world, 
regardless of their economic, social and cultural situation, and that its extent and 
manifestations are particularly severe in developing countries, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that the existence of widespread extreme poverty inhibits the full and 
effective enjoyment of human rights and that its immediate alleviation and eventual 
eradication must remain a high priority for the international community, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> its resolutions 5/1, on the institution-building of the Human Rights 
Council, and 5/2, on the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate Holders of the 
Council, of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his or her 
duties in accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing</i> its gratitude to the previous mandate holder on extreme poverty and 
human rights for the important work accomplished in the discharge of her mandate, in 
particular for her work on the drafting of the guiding principles on extreme poverty and 
human rights, and conscious of the necessity to continue working on the implementation of 
the principles, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Welcomes</i> the work of the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human 
rights, including the comprehensive, transparent and inclusive consultations conducted with 
relevant and interested actors from all regions for her thematic reports, as well as the 
undertaking of country missions, and welcomes the report of the Special Rapporteur on 
extreme poverty and human rights on fiscal and tax policy;1

effective fulfilment of his mandate;
