<p> At its 47th meeting, on 21 March 2013, the Human Rights Council decided to adopt 
the text below: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;<i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolution 16/21 of 25 March 2011 on the review 
of the work and functioning of the Human Rights Council, in particular paragraph 61 of the 
annex thereto, in which the Council decided to establish a task force to study the issues of 
secretariat services, accessibility for persons with disabilities and use of information 
technology, as envisaged in paragraphs 57, 58, 59 and 60 of the annex, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> Human Rights Council decision 19/119 of 22 March 2012, in which 
the Council endorsed the report of the task force, annexed to decision 19/119, including its 
recommendations with the modalities made in the report, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> <i>further</i> General Assembly resolution 66/246 of 24 December 2011, in 
which the Assembly stressed the importance of an open, transparent and all-inclusive 
United Nations, and decided to approve the live webcasting and subsequent storage of all 
the formal meetings of its six Main Committees, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note</i> of the current arrangement between the Department of Public 
Information, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and 
the Information Service, which relies mainly on extrabudgetary resources to fund webcast 
coverage of the meetings of the Human Rights Council, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the added value of the live webcasting and subsequent storage of the 
formal meetings held in the framework of the sessions of the Human Rights Council and 
the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, which constitute archive records of 
Council meetings, in particular in view of the lack of summary records, as well as being an 
important tool for public outreach, 
</p>
<p>  
 &#61482; The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of 
</p>
<p>the Council on its twenty-second session (A/HRC/22/2), chap. I. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p> <i>Recommends</i> that the General Assembly consider ways to ensure sustainable live 
webcasting and subsequent storage of the meetings of the Human Rights Council held in 
the framework of the sessions of the Council and of the Working Group on the Universal 
Periodic Review.&#8221;
