<p>GE.10-12597 <b>3 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 10/1, the Human Rights Council requested the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights to submit to the Council an annual report on the question of the 
realization in all countries of economic, social and cultural rights. The present report refers 
to activities relevant to the promotion and protection of these rights, focusing particularly 
on the activities of United Nations treaty bodies; the Human Rights Council special 
procedures with mandates relevant to economic, social and cultural rights; and the Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). Concerning 
OHCHR, the present report includes some illustrative examples of the activities undertaken 
at headquarters and field presences in the field of economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
</b></p>
<p>2. As of 26 February 2010 there are 160 States parties to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, an increase of one State party, the Bahamas, in 2009. 
</p>
<p>3. On 20 December 2008, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. This treaty 
was opened for signature and ratification in New York on 24 September 2009 and as of 1 
March 2010 there are 32 signatories to the treaty. 
</p>
<p>4. During 2009, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights held two 
sessions and examined the status of implementation of the Covenant in the following 10 
States parties: Australia, Brazil, Cambodia, Chad, Cyprus, the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, Madagascar, Poland, the Republic of Korea and the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland. 
</p>
<p>5. The Committee adopted two new general comments during 2009: No. 20 (art. 2, 
para. 2 of the Covenant) on non-discrimination in the enjoyment of economic, social and 
cultural rights and No. 21 (art. 15, para. 1 (a), of the Covenant) on the right of everyone to 
take part in cultural life. 
</p>
<p>6. In October 2009, OHCHR organized for the Committee a seminar on the 
justiciability of economic, social and cultural rights, aiming to offer relevant inputs on 
comparative experiences in the adjudication of such rights, given that the Optional Protocol 
mandates the Committee to examine individual communications amongst other functions. 
The seminar provided space to discuss relevant substantive and procedural issues posed by 
litigation in the field of economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>7. At its forty-third session, in November 2009, the Committee held an information 
session on the right to sexual and reproductive health organized by the United Nations 
Population Fund and with the participation of the World Health Organization. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Committee on the Rights of the Child 
</b></p>
<p>8. In 2009, the Committee continued to address issues of economic, social and cultural 
rights as part of its periodic reviews of State party reports. 
</p>
<p>9. Furthermore, the Committee adopted two general comments in 2009 exploring 
aspects of economic, social and cultural rights. During its fiftieth session in January 2009, </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.10-12597 
</p>
<p>the Committee on the Rights of the Child adopted its general comment No. 11 on 
indigenous children and their rights. The general comment underscores the importance of 
the right to be registered, to bilingual education, to health, to the enjoyment of culture, 
religion and language and to participation, and highlights special measures required by 
States in order to guarantee the effective exercise of indigenous children&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>10. During its fifty-first session in June 2009, the Committee on the Rights of the Child 
adopted its general comment No. 12 on the right of the child to be heard. The general 
comment addresses the application of article 12 to, inter alia, the rights to health, social 
security, education, living conditions and protection. 
</p>
<p>11. In December 2009, the first session of the Open-ended Working Group to explore 
the possibility of elaborating an optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child took place. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Human Rights Committee 
</b></p>
<p>12. In 2009, the issue of the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights was 
raised by the Human Rights Committee in connection with rights provided in the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, in particular the prohibition of 
discrimination and equality between men and women, the rights of detained persons and the 
rights of minorities, thus highlighting the indivisibility, interrelatedness and 
interdependence of all human rights. 
</p>
<p>13. During its review of States parties&#8217; periodic reports in 2009, the Committee 
expressed concern about serious disadvantages regarding access to housing, social security, 
health care and education facilities as a result of discrimination on the grounds of sexual 
orientation. The Committee also deplored the shortcomings in access to housing and 
employment as a form of discrimination suffered by persons with disabilities. On several 
occasions the Committee expressed great concern about massive shortcomings in the 
provision of health facilities and adequate food in prisons. 
</p>
<p>14. In its concluding observations addressed to one State party, the Committee 
expressed concern about the lack of conservation of the cultural heritage of a specific 
minority. In relation to three other States parties, the Committee regretted the insufficient 
access of certain minorities to health, education, and social security services. In Views 
adopted regarding an individual communication, the Committee recalled that economic 
development shall not undermine the rights protected by article 27, and considered that the 
State party concerned had taken measures which substantially interfered with the culturally 
significant economic activities of an indigenous community, without giving them an 
opportunity to participate in the decision-making process. The Committee concluded that 
the State party had breached the complainant&#8217;s right to enjoy her own culture together with 
the other members of her group. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Committee on Migrant Workers 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Committee on Migrant Workers continued to address the enjoyment of 
economic, social and cultural rights of all migrant workers and members of their families. 
During 2009, the Committee held two sessions and considered the initial reports submitted 
by Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Colombia, the Philippines and Sri Lanka. Issues 
raised during the consideration of these reports were, inter alia, the right to form and join 
trade unions; the right to an effective remedy for violations of migrants&#8217; rights, especially 
labour rights; right to health, in particular for undocumented migrant workers and members 
of their families; supervision of recruitment agencies; the situation of children of migrant </p>


<p>GE.10-12597 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>families; and the desirability of social security agreements between countries of origin and 
of employment. 
</p>
<p>16. On 1 May 2009, the Committee organized, on the International Labour Day, a round 
table on the right to freedom of association for migrant workers, in cooperation with the 
ILO and trade union organizations. In October 2009, the Committee held a day of general 
discussion on migrant domestic workers, with the participation of human rights experts, 
representatives of States, United Nations agencies, and international and civil society 
organizations. The Day aimed at providing input to the debate at the ninety-ninth session of 
the International Labour Conference in 2010, which will discuss &#8220;Decent work for domestic 
workers&#8221; and consider the adoption of a new ILO instrument on domestic workers by 2011. 
More generally, the Committee intended to promote greater awareness of the particular 
situation and rights of migrant domestic workers. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 
</b></p>
<p>17. During its forty-third session, in January 2009, the Committee adopted a statement 
on the international financial crisis stressing that gender perspectives should be taken into 
account in relation to the impacts of the crisis on both a long- and short-term basis, 
including in relation to education, health, security and livelihoods. The Committee 
underscored the importance of recognizing the unique contribution that women can make in 
the timely resolution of the crisis and called upon States parties to include women in the 
dialogue and decision-making processes around these issues. The Committee also adopted a 
statement calling on all States parties to support international efforts to alleviate the 
humanitarian and economic situation in Gaza and to facilitate the provision and distribution 
of humanitarian assistance including food and medical treatment, especially to women and 
children. 
</p>
<p>18. At its forty-fifth session, in July 2009, the Committee adopted a statement on gender 
and climate change which recalled that safety nets and insurance for social protection are 
essential to national adaptation plans as part of poverty reduction strategies, but that many 
women do not have access to health-care facilities and social security. While all women 
have the right to an adequate standard of living, housing and communications as well as to 
shelter during crisis situations due to natural disasters, the Committee regretted that women 
often face discrimination in this regard. Sex-disaggregated data, gender-sensitive policies 
and programme guidelines to aid Governments are necessary to protect women&#8217;s rights to 
personal security and sustainable livelihoods. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>19. In 2009, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination concluded its 
thematic discussion on the special measures to promote disadvantaged racial or ethnic 
groups in fields such as education, employment and housing under the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. As a result, in 
August 2009, the Committee adopted general recommendation No. 32, which includes a 
detailed list of such measures. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture 
</b></p>
<p>20. In the context of its mandate to visit all places of detention and to provide assistance 
to States parties to prevent torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture (SPT) undertook in 2009 three </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.10-12597 
</p>
<p>preventive visits, to Cambodia, Honduras and Paraguay. In such endeavours, the SPT 
adopted an integral approach, considering both civil and political and economic, social and 
cultural rights. The conditions that the SPT monitors during its visits encompass the 
enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights by persons deprived of their liberty. 
Reports and recommendations of the SPT refer to, inter alia, the enjoyment of the right to 
health, the right to food, the right to work, the right to education and other economic, social 
and cultural rights. Attention was particularly paid to persons in vulnerable situations, such 
as children, persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and people of African descent, 
women, and migrants. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Activities of special procedures 
</b></p>
<p>21. The independent expert on the issue of human rights obligations related to access to 
safe drinking water and sanitation, Catarina de Albuquerque, devoted 2009 to examining 
the issue of human rights obligations related to access to sanitation, recognizing that this 
topic has been relatively neglected if compared with the associated area of water. The 
report reviews the integral relationship between sanitation and multiple other civil, cultural, 
economic, political and social rights, and concludes that analysing sanitation only through 
the lens of other human rights is insufficient. She notes a trend towards recognizing 
sanitation as a distinct right, and supports this trend because of its fundamental connection 
to human dignity. She also embarked on a process of collecting good practices, beginning 
by establishing criteria for the identification of such practices from a human rights 
perspective. She undertook fact-finding missions to Costa Rica and Egypt, as well as a joint 
mission to Bangladesh with the independent expert on the question of human rights and 
extreme poverty. 
</p>
<p>22. In March 2009, the Human Rights Council established the mandate of the 
independent expert in the field of cultural rights. In October 2009, the Council appointed 
the first independent expert on cultural rights, Farida Shaheed. The mandate requires her to 
identify best practices in the promotion and protection of cultural rights, to identify 
obstacles to the enjoyment of cultural rights, to work with States to foster the adoption of 
measures to promote and protect cultural rights, and to study the relationship between 
cultural rights and cultural diversity. 
</p>
<p>23. In 2009, the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Olivier De Schutter, continued 
working on the impact of the global food prices crisis, notably by participating in the 
General Assembly thematic dialogue on the global food crisis and the right to food in April 
</p><p>2009. He also participated in the reform of the FAO Committee on World Food Security. 
The Special Rapporteur examined the impact of trade policies and agriculture policies on 
the realization of the right to food, and advocated for a new approach and renewed 
investment in agriculture in Africa. He also studied the phenomenon of large-scale land 
acquisitions and leases, calling on all stakeholders to consider their potential effect on the 
realization of the right to food and to improve the security of tenure of smallholder farmers. 
He set forth guiding principles on large-scale land acquisitions and leases. In June 2009, the 
Special Rapporteur convened a conference in Berlin of representatives of agricultural 
business corporations to discuss their role in the protection of the right to food. He also 
conducted two missions to Benin and Nicaragua and two follow-up missions to Guatemala 
and Brazil. 
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, Anand Grover, presented his annual 
report to the Human Rights Council in June 2009. The report considered the relationship 
between the right to the highest attainable standard of health and intellectual property 
rights, especially with regard to access to medicines, as well as impact of the TRIPS </p>


<p>GE.10-12597 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>Agreements and flexibilities on national patent laws of developing and least-developed 
countries. In his annual report presented to the General Assembly in August 2009, the 
Special Rapporteur discussed the human rights basis for informed consent in clinical 
practice, public health and medical research and outlined its importance for respecting, 
protecting and fulfilling the right to health. During the reporting period, he undertook 
country missions to Poland and to Australia. 
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an 
adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context, Raquel 
Rolnik, undertook missions to Maldives and to the United States of America. In March 
2009, she presented her annual report to the Human Rights Council on the consequences of 
the housing and financial crisis in the realization of the right to adequate housing. She also 
presented a report on the follow-up to country recommendations for Afghanistan, Mexico, 
Peru and Romania and a preliminary note on her mission to Maldives. In October 2009, she 
presented her annual report to the General Assembly on the impacts of climate change in 
the fulfilment of the right to adequate housing. 
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur on the right to education, Vernor Mu&#241;oz, presented his 
annual thematic report to the Human Rights Council, which focused on the right to 
education of persons in detention. The report calls for sustained efforts to respect, protect 
and fulfil that right. It underscores that prisoners face significant and complex educational 
challenges, due to a range of environmental, social, organizational and individual factors. In 
his report to the General Assembly, he discussed the issue of lifelong learning and human 
rights underlining their mutual interdependence. He undertook missions to Paraguay and 
Mongolia. 
</p>
<p>27. In his annual report to the Human Rights Council, presented in September 2009, the 
Special Rapporteur on the adverse effects of the movement and dumping of toxic and 
dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights, Okechukwu Ibeanu, 
focused on the adverse effects of ship-breaking activities on the enjoyment of human rights. 
The report notes that every year a great number of workers die or are seriously injured 
because of work-related accidents or occupational diseases related to long-term exposure to 
hazardous materials present on end-of-life ships. Workers do not usually receive any 
information or safety training and live in facilities which often lack basic requirements such 
as sanitation, electricity and drinking water. There is a general lack of medical facilities and 
social protection, and injured workers or their relatives hardly receive any compensation for 
accidents resulting in fatal injuries or permanent disabilities. During 2009, he undertook a 
country visit to the Kyrgyz Republic, where he examined the potential adverse effects that 
the unsound management of radioactive wastes and obsolete or banned pesticides may have 
on human health and the environment. 
</p>
<p>28. The independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty, 
Magdalena Sepulveda, is currently developing an in-depth analysis of public policies aimed 
at eliminating extreme poverty with a view to identifying best practices and disseminating 
important lessons learned. In 2009, her reports focused on cash transfer schemes and the 
importance of social protection in the context of the global financial crisis. The report to the 
Human Rights Council recognized that cash transfer schemes are a tool to fulfil obligations 
under human rights law relating, in particular, to the right to social security and the right to 
an adequate standard of living. Nonetheless, it underlines that these schemes must be 
integrated within social protection systems and grounded in human rights standards and 
principles. The report to the General Assembly describes the need to establish solid social 
protection systems in the context of the global financial crisis. In 2009, she visited 
Bangladesh and Zambia, paying particular attention to social assistance schemes in both 
countries. </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.10-12597 
</p>
<p>29. The independent expert on the effects of foreign debt and other related international 
financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly 
economic, social and cultural rights, Cephas Lumina, undertook a country mission to 
Norway and Ecuador to examine the issue of illegitimate debt. The independent expert 
participated in the 2009 Social Forum in Geneva where he spoke on the impact of the 
global economic and financial crisis on efforts to combat poverty. 
</p>
<p>30. The independent expert on human rights and international solidarity presented his 
report to the Human Rights Council in September 2009. This report underscored that 
international solidarity is a principle of international law, and a precondition to human 
dignity and rights, particularly against the backdrop of the current global crises and climate 
change. The report discussed collective and shared responsibilities, inter- and intra-
generational equity and common but differentiated responsibilities in the context of 
sustainable development. It also made explicit reference to general comments by the 
Committees on Economic, Social and Cultural and on the Rights of the Child on 
obligations not only to implement within the jurisdiction of ratifying States, but also to 
contribute, though international cooperation, to global implementation. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Activities of the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b>31. During 2009, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights conducted an 
office-wide consultation to elaborate the High Commissioner&#8217;s Plan of Action and the 
Strategic Management Plan for the period 2010&#8211;2011. As a result, six thematic priorities 
and strategies were identified: countering discrimination; combating impunity and 
strengthening accountability, the rule of law and democratic society; pursuing economic, 
social and cultural rights and combating inequalities and poverty; protecting human rights 
in the context of migration; protecting human rights in situations of armed conflict, 
violence and insecurity; and strengthening human rights mechanisms and the progressive 
development of international human rights law. While one of the thematic priorities is 
directly focused on economic, social and cultural rights, the Strategic Management Plan 
makes it clear that these rights make an integral part of all six priorities. 
</p>
<p>32. In 2009, the Office continued to work for the promotion and protection of economic, 
social and cultural rights through a wide range of activities at the country, regional and 
headquarters levels. The work of OHCHR on economic, social and cultural rights was 
guided by the following priorities: greater country engagement to ensure that international 
human rights standards are implemented on the ground, an enhanced leadership role for the 
High Commissioner, closer partnerships with civil society and United Nations agencies, 
and greater synergy with the United Nations human rights bodies. 
</p>
<p>33. The sections below illustrate some of the activities implemented by the Office in the 
field of economic, social and cultural rights through the lens of these priorities. These do 
not aim at offering an exhaustive overview of the work of OHCHR on economic, social and 
cultural rights, but rather at providing some examples of the action taken at country, 
regional and headquarters levels. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Greater country engagement 
</b></p>
<p>34. In 2009, OHCHR continued to strengthen its country engagement efforts through 
monitoring activities, research on specific issues, technical cooperation and assistance, 
collaboration with various stakeholders, as well as increased deployment of human rights 
staff to countries, regional offices and peace missions. </p>


<p>GE.10-12597 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>35. Activities carried out in relation to economic, social and cultural rights in the field 
included monitoring, support to legal protection and legal reform, support to the 
development and implementation of national policies and programmes, capacity-building 
and awareness-raising. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the right to 
development also offered entry points for field presences to engage in work on economic, 
social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>36. Several field presences monitored cases of violations of economic, social and 
cultural rights. For example, as part of its programme on the right to adequate housing and 
land issues, OHCHR-Cambodia has been monitoring a number of cases of eviction and 
resettlement of communities. The Office worked with government authorities, United 
Nations agencies, development partners and NGOs to promote that evictions and 
relocations are conducted legally and uphold United Nations resettlement standards. In 
rural areas, OHCHR-Cambodia has continued to monitor the impacts of the sale or lease of 
land for agro-business purposes on communities&#8217; economic, social and cultural rights. The 
Office continued to monitor and investigate cases of threats and arrests of community 
members and civil society actors in relation to land-related activism, providing advice to 
relevant authorities to comply with the due process of law. Furthermore, OHCHR-
Cambodia prison reform programme systematically monitored prisoners&#8217; economic, social 
and cultural rights, such as access to food, to health services, to adequate drinking water 
and sanitation and to education or vocational training. 
</p>
<p>37. OHCHR-Colombia paid special attention in 2009 to the protection of rights of 
indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombian communities, in particular with respect to the 
implementation of the 2009 Constitutional Court orders on the situation of internally 
displaced persons. The Office participated in a public hearing in Congress about a judicial 
order regarding indigenous people and provided analysis and made recommendations 
regarding the implementation of an order on Afro-Colombian communities. 
</p>
<p>38. In 2009, Guatemala again faced a food crisis caused by climate and economic 
phenomena resulting in harvest losses and higher basic grain prices. The crisis affected an 
estimated population of 2.5 million people, particularly in the &#8220;dry corridor&#8221;, including an 
undetermined loss of lives of children due to acute malnutrition. OHCHR-Guatemala 
carried out missions to monitor the situation, focusing specially on the right to food.  
</p>
<p>39. OHCHR-Mexico followed several cases on economic, social, cultural and 
environmental rights, especially those of indigenous people. The Office had focused its 
attention particularly on human rights issues related to land and natural resources. Most of 
these cases are related to large-scale development projects. OHCHR-Mexico followed up 
on several cases by systematizing information, sending letters to relevant authorities, 
building up the legal capacity of communities, participating in different forums and 
seminars and sending information to special procedures.    
</p>
<p>40. OHCHR-Nepal paid close attention to land occupation and forced evictions, with the 
aim to ensure that the rights of those subject to eviction are respected. To this end, OHCHR 
developed eviction guidelines (in English and Nepali) in coordination with the National 
Human Rights Commission which set forth minimum standards for State authorities in 
relation to evictions. 
</p>
<p>41. After publishing a thematic report on the right to food at the end of 2008, the 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights Unit of the Human Rights and Transitional Justice 
Section of UNMIT (the United Nations Mission in Timor-Leste) conducted follow-up 
monitoring and reporting between February and June 2009. Some recommendations from 
the thematic report of 2008 were implemented at the district level, and awareness regarding 
Government-subsidized rice increased in the general population. </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.10-12597 
</p>
<p>42. OHCHR/UNAMA (Afghanistan) undertook field-based research to contribute to a 
better understanding of how human rights perspectives can contribute to poverty 
alleviation. The report, entitled &#8220;Willful Neglect: The Human Rights Dimension of 
Poverty&#8221;, employs the enjoyment of the right to food as the entry point to examine poverty. 
</p><p>43. In Serbia, an important joint work was undertaken by the Human Rights Adviser, in 
close collaboration with the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) and other key partners, 
on the evictions and relocation of informal Roma settlements in Belgrade. This work 
included, inter alia, an expert mission to assess the situation, dissemination of information 
on international standards related to forced evictions, assessment of relocation sites and 
collaborative work with the authorities. 
</p>
<p>44. Human rights field presences have also supported processes of legal protection and 
reform of legislation related to the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. For 
example, OHCHR-Uganda has engaged in advocacy for the establishment of functional 
land adjudication bodies, training for land adjudicators on due process, non-discrimination, 
and gender standards, and advocacy at the national level for prioritization and resource 
provision for oversight and review of local land adjudication. 
</p><p>45. In October 2009, OHCHR Regional Office in Panama organized a regional seminar 
for parliamentarians. A day was devoted to the Optional Protocol to the Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In follow-up to the seminar, the Regional Office has 
been in contact with parliamentarians in El Salvador and Costa Rica to promote the 
ratification of the Optional Protocol. 
</p>
<p>46. The Human Rights Adviser in Ecuador promoted the justiciability of economic, 
social and cultural rights, organizing activities with the National Assembly, the Ministry of 
Justice, the judiciary, universities and civil society organizations. A book on judicial 
protection of social rights and an interactive CD-ROM toolbox on these rights were 
published and distributed. A session with the National Assembly was devoted to promote 
the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights.  
</p>
<p>47. Field presences have helped with the development and implementation of national 
public policies relevant to economic, social and cultural rights. In 2009 OHCHR-Cambodia 
undertook work at policy level to encourage development partners and the Government to 
develop comprehensive national guidelines on resettlement. Advice was also offered to 
development partners and the Government on the human rights and legal aspects of two key 
policy documents developed in 2009: a Circular on Illegal Settlements in urban areas and a 
Law on Expropriation. Several tools and materials on land and evictions were published.  
</p>
<p>48. OHCHR-Uganda&#8217;s support was sought by the Ministry of Health to contribute with 
a human rights review of sector policies and plans. In addition, technical advice was 
provided to the draft mental health bill which was revised in line with the provisions of the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and international human rights 
standards. OHCHR has also engaged in advocacy for the establishment of functional land 
adjudication bodies, training for land adjudicators on due process, non-discrimination, and 
gender standards, and advocacy at national level for prioritization and resource provision 
for oversight and review of local land adjudication. 
</p><p>49. In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Human Rights Adviser 
disseminated widely and brought to the attention of partners general comment No. 20 of the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on non-discrimination in economic, 
social and cultural rights. This informed the Government&#8217;s draft of a comprehensive anti-
discrimination law which includes discrimination in the area of economic, social and 
cultural rights.  </p>


<p>GE.10-12597 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>50. Field presences in Ecuador, Nepal and Mexico have worked towards strengthening 
the capacity of national authorities to integrate human rights indicators in the work of their 
statistic-collecting agencies, and in monitoring and evaluating public policies oriented to 
fulfil economic, social and cultural rights. For example, OHRHC-Mexico has promoted the 
elaboration of indicators on the right to health and education, among others, in 
collaboration with the National Institute for Statistics and Geography and the National 
Human Rights Commission. OHCHR-Nepal conducted a number of workshops for 
government officials, the national human rights institution and civil society organizations 
on human rights indicators and their use of a tool for measuring progress of human rights, 
especially economic, social and cultural rights. OHCHR-Nepal is working to ensure that 
human rights indicators are contextualized in Nepal and adopted as a tool for evaluating the 
implementation of treaty body recommendations. In Ecuador, OHCHR provided training on 
human rights indicators to the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, the System of Social 
Indicators, the National Institute of Statistics and Census, the National Secretary of Plan 
and Development, and the Ombudsman. As a result, these authorities decided to implement 
a system of justice and human rights indicators to guarantee the coordination, 
systematization and updating of the information on the situation of respect of human rights 
and the access of justice.  
</p><p>51. Many OHCHR field presences continued to provide support for capacity-building in 
the area of economic, social and cultural rights notably through training workshops. 
Participants in the workshops included government officials, local authorities, 
parliamentarians, national human rights institutions, non-governmental and community-
based organizations, United Nations staff, representatives of the private sector and the 
media, human rights defenders, legal and health professionals, academia, trade unions and 
students. For instance, OHCHR-Uganda continued to work on justice for internally 
displaced persons in land matters. The respective strategy entailed, inter alia, training on 
women&#8217;s rights including in access to land, and on advocacy skills for women&#8217;s groups, 
community-based organizations, and agro-community organizations. Such capacity 
strengthening is extended to enable these organized entities to support rights holders, 
especially women.  
</p>
<p>52. OHCHR/UNAMA (Afghanistan) undertook a mentoring programme for the Afghan 
Independent Human Rights Commission on economic and social rights that focused on 
strengthening its capacity to analyse economic and social data from a human rights 
perspective. This resulted in the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission 
(AIHRC) preparing its fourth annual report on economic and social rights and in the 
submission by the AIHRC of a shadow report to the Committee on Economic, Cultural and 
Social Rights. It also conducted three workshops on a human rights-based approach to 
development in Dai Kundi province, in particular for provincial authorities. 
</p>
<p>53. In Timor-Leste, UNMIT conducted seven follow-up workshops on economic, social 
and cultural rights and a human rights-based approach at the district level. As a result six 
NGOs are monitoring these rights and applying some human rights-based approach 
principles. The unit also conducted in-house training on monitoring these rights for staff of 
the National Human Rights Institution in 2009, which resulted in the NHRI monitoring 
these rights since February 2010. Furthermore, it organized a workshop on the right to 
adequate housing for representatives of the Government and NGOs. Following the 
workshop, the housing rights network, consisting of six NGOs, has been conducting 
research on adequate housing in Timor-Leste. 
</p>
<p>54. In 2009 the OHCHR Regional Office for Central Asia organized several trainings 
and a regional workshop to increase awareness of the international standards on the right to 
adequate housing among human rights activists and NGOs in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and 
Tajikistan. Moreover, grants were allocated by the Regional Office to four NGOs to support </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.10-12597 
</p>
<p>them in undertaking concrete initiatives to promote the right to adequate housing in their 
respective countries. Grant projects focus on provision of free legal aid, advocacy for 
ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, raising awareness about the relevant national legislation on housing rights and 
international standards as well as advocacy through creation of video reels and films. 
</p>
<p>55. OHCHR Regional Office for Central America in Panama led the establishment of a 
regional inter-agency human rights group. One of the initiatives of the group was to 
organize, in April 2009, training for trainers on the right to food, especially regarding 
indigenous peoples and Afro-descendant population, with various United Nations agencies 
and the support of the Regional Directors Team. In September 2009 the Regional Office 
and WFP organized a technical consultation on the right to food with special focus on 
children under 2 years of age. The consultation brought together experts, representatives of 
United Nations agencies and programmes, international cooperation agencies and NGOs. 
The outcome document calls on OHCHR and WFP, in cooperation with other agencies, to 
further promote the analysis and action to strengthen the enjoyment of the right to food by 
children under 2 in the region. 
</p>
<p>56. OHCHR Regional Office in Chile sponsored and participated in the teaching of two 
diploma courses on economic, social and cultural rights organized by the Henry Dunant 
Institute for NGOs, public officials and other stakeholders from the Latin American Region 
in Santiago. 
</p>
<p>57. OHCHR Regional Office in Bangkok provided support to capacity-building in the 
area of economic, social and cultural rights notably through training workshops and worked 
to raise awareness about economic, social and cultural rights among various stakeholders 
and has been supporting the establishment of an ASEAN human rights system. 
</p>
<p>58. Field presences have also worked to raise awareness about economic, social and 
cultural rights among various stakeholders. For example, to further raise awareness on 
United Nations standards on resettlement, OHCHR-Cambodia published a bilingual booklet 
containing frequently asked questions on the right to housing and protection against 
eviction, general comment No. 7 on forced evictions and the Basic Principles and 
Guidelines on Eviction and Displacement by the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing. 
The latter was also published by OHCHR-Mexico. OHCHR-Nepal has engaged in 
awareness-raising about the human rights of <i>haliyas </i>(bonded labourers working as land 
tillers) and other socially marginalized and discriminated groups through the medium of 
forum theatre combined with workshops for local advocacy and capacity-building 
activities. OHCHR Regional Office in Bangkok contributed to increasing awareness among 
persons with disabilities by publishing and distributing leaflets about their rights and 
producing an advocacy documentary dedicated to issues of employment opportunities and 
accessibility of buildings for persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>59. The MDGs and the right to development also provided field presences with 
opportunities to approach development and poverty reduction from a human rights 
perspective. In 2009, OHCHR set a strategic goal to strengthen national accountability in 
MDG-based development processes and poverty reduction strategies from human rights 
perspectives. Consultations with OHCHR field presences and assessment missions to Haiti 
and Liberia during the first half of 2009 helped developing a draft operational framework 
on the practical use of existing human rights monitoring tools in assessing and monitoring 
the specific human rights standards and principles most relevant to policies, particularly in 
the poverty reduction context. The framework provided an analytical mapping of key 
research initiatives, to be further complemented with country case studies and good 
experiences.  </p>


<p>GE.10-12597 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>60. Furthermore, OHCHR developed a draft training package on a human rights-based 
approach to budget monitoring and advocacy. A first training workshop on budget 
monitoring was held in Haiti in November 2009 jointly with the Human Rights Section of 
the United Nations Mission in Haiti. Similar training was also organized in Liberia in 
December 2009 with support and assistance from the Human Rights and Protection Section 
of the United Nations Mission in Liberia. A variety of Government, civil society and 
UNCT actors in both countries benefited from these workshops. As follow-up, OHCHR 
field presences in Haiti and Liberia, through consultation with national partners, are in the 
process of formulating specific follow-up projects in the country, with a focus on piloting 
some of the budget monitoring tools in the national policy and budget formulation and 
implementation processes. The prospects of such follow-up in Haiti will be delayed, due to 
recent tragic consequences of the earthquake in early January 2010. 
</p>
<p>61. In October 2009 in Arusha, Tanzania, the OHCHR Regional Office in East Africa 
jointly organized with the Department for Political Affairs of the African Union 
Commission and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, a meeting of 
experts on the universal periodic review (UPR) and the African Peer Review Mechanism, 
with specific consideration of the right to development in Africa. Practical 
recommendations from the meeting included the need for both mechanisms to focus on the 
right to development and to request information on specific State policies regarding 
development. While harmonization and coordination of reporting systems at the national 
level were felt necessary, the need for strengthening the African Peer Review Mechanism 
structure at the national level to ensure that State submissions reflect input of civil society 
organizations was also emphasized in order to raise public awareness and ownership. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Enhanced human rights leadership 
</b></p>
<p>62. The High Commissioner advocated for the integration of a human rights-based 
approach in the response efforts to the global food security crisis. OHCHR contributed to 
the Secretary-General&#8217;s statement at the High-Level Meeting on &#8220;Food Security for All&#8221;, 
held in Madrid in January 2009, emphasizing that the right to food should be fully 
integrated into both emergency assistance and in efforts to achieve sustainable food and 
nutrition security for all. During the World Summit on Food Security, organized in Rome in 
November 2009, the Deputy High Commissioner stressed that the right to food requires 
concrete actions, such as the mapping of the food insecure, the adoption of legislation and 
policies with a right to food framework, the establishment of accountability mechanisms to 
enable rights-holders to claim their rights, and the participation of rights-holders, 
particularly the most vulnerable, in the design and monitoring of relevant legislation and 
policies. In February 2009, OHCHR joined the High-Level Task Force on the Global Food 
Security Crisis convened by the United Nations Secretary-General and actively contributes 
to the update process of the Comprehensive Framework for Action. 
</p>
<p>63. In the context of the recent global financial crisis, the High Commissioner advocated 
for the integration of human rights in the responses to the crisis. In particular, the High 
Commissioner participated in the General Assembly Conference on the World Financial 
and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development to assess the financial crisis (June 
2009) and the International Seminar on Human Rights and MDGs (The Hague, May 2009), 
strongly advocating and highlighting the international dimensions of human rights 
obligations. OHCHR also contributed to efforts in framing the longer-term United Nations 
response to the financial crisis. 
</p>
<p>64. The High Commissioner devoted her 2009 report to the Economic and Social 
Council to the implementation and monitoring of economic, social and cultural rights. The 
report outlines various ways of monitoring legislation and other normative measures, such </p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.10-12597 
</p>
<p>as regulations, policies, plans and programmes, in the area of economic, social and cultural 
rights. 
</p>
<p>65. In 2009, the OHCHR continued the advocacy work on the centrality of human rights 
in the AIDS response. This was done by providing information to the treaty monitoring 
bodies on the HIV-related human rights concerns in countries under consideration and by 
preparing the Secretary-General&#8217;s report on the protection and promotion of human rights 
in the context of HIV and AIDS for the tenth session of the Human Rights Council. The 
Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights participated in the Ninth International 
Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific held in Bali, where she made a number of 
statements highlighting the urgent need to address human rights issues in order to overcome 
obstacles to an effective response to the epidemic. OHCHR organized a side event during 
the Durban Review Conference on &#8220;HIV-related discrimination: restrictions on the entry, 
stay and residence of people living with HIV&#8221;. Furthermore, regional workshops were held 
in Dakar and Lima to support national human rights institutions in promoting rights-based 
national responses to HIV and to operationalize the joint OHCHR/UNAIDS Handbook on 
HIV and Human Rights for National Human Rights Institutions. 
</p>
<p>66. Under its mandate to mainstream the right to development, OHCHR organized 
activities aimed to integrate the right to development in several areas of international 
cooperation. These included a parallel event on Financing for Development during the 2009 
General Assembly session in New York; a co-sponsored event on Human Rights Impact 
Assessments at the World Trade Organization Public Policy Forum with an NGO; and a 
side event on the World Intellectual Property Organization&#8217;s Development Agenda, co-
sponsored by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the 
International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Closer partnerships with civil society and United Nations agencies 
</b></p>
<p>67. OHCHR continued its close partnership and collaboration with various United 
Nations agencies and civil society organizations working on issues related to the promotion 
and protection of economic, social and cultural rights, the MDGs and poverty reduction. 
</p>
<p>68. In 2009 OHCHR continued to closely collaborate with various United Nations 
agencies working on issues related to the promotion and protection of economic, social and 
cultural rights, including the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Health 
Organization (WHO), UN-Habitat, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS 
(UNAIDS) and UNESCO. As a result of this collaboration, OHCHR produced several 
documents for wide dissemination with other United Nations agencies, including the joint 
publication of a fact sheet on the right to housing with UN-Habitat, and the joint 
elaboration of fact sheets on the right to water with WHO and UN-Habitat and on the right 
to food with FAO, both to be published in 2010. With UNESCO and UNICEF, OHCHR 
started working on a joint publication on the right to education in the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which will be ready for publication in 2010. The Office 
substantively contributed to the joint OHCHR/WHO tool on a human rights-based approach 
and gender equality in national health strategies, and to the finalization of the Inter-Agency 
Standing Committee (IASC) Guidelines on HIV in Humanitarian Situations, and co-
produced the Policy Brief on Disability and HIV, together with UNAIDS and WHO. 
</p>
<p>69. OHCHR continued its close collaboration with UN-Habitat. A delegation from the 
Office travelled to UN-Habitat&#8217;s headquarters in Nairobi to discuss how to enhance and 
develop the joint work. The delegation also met with UNEP to discuss the development of 
the two organizations&#8217; joint work in various areas, including on environment and climate 
change and human rights. OHCHR also contributed to the publication of a Policy Guide to 
Housing for Indigenous Peoples in Cities with UN-Habitat. </p>


<p>GE.10-12597 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>70. Joint work with UNESCO included the participation of OHCHR in seminars to 
support the adoption of the general comment on the right to participate in cultural rights by 
the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and to clarify the scope of the 
right to benefit from scientific progress and its applications. 
</p>
<p>71. Regarding collaboration with civil society, OHCHR continued to facilitate a 
consultation process among representatives of indigenous communities and seven 
Governments of the Amazon Basin and El Chaco to formulate guidelines to protect the 
rights of indigenous peoples in voluntary isolation and in initial contact. A first draft of the 
guidelines was revised at a consultation meeting convened in Geneva in March 2009. The 
draft guidelines include principles for the development of policies and programmes in key 
areas such as health, and underscore the interdependence between the cultural rights of 
indigenous peoples and other rights such as the right to self-determination. 
</p>
<p>72. OHCHR continued its work related to the impact of extractive industry activities on 
indigenous peoples and their land. It participated in an expert meeting held in Spain in 
October 2009 to examine existing international and other initiatives and mechanisms for the 
prevention of conflict related to extractive industries and indigenous peoples. As part of its 
substantive and organizational support to the United Nations Expert Mechanism on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples, OHCHR organized a technical workshop on the right of 
indigenous peoples to education in order to contribute to the study on lessons learned and 
challenges to achieve the implementation of the right of indigenous peoples to education. 
</p>
<p>73. The work of the OHCHR in the field of minority rights also contributed to the 
promotion and implementation of economic, social and cultural rights. This included a 
comprehensive minority fellowship programme that contained substantive elements of 
economic, social and cultural rights, building minorities&#8217; capacity and skills in these areas. 
The Office has also launched a regional capacity-building project for Afro-descendants in 
the Andean region, aimed to strengthen their capacity and skills to invoke human rights 
standards, including economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p><b> D. More synergy with United Nations human rights bodies 
</b></p>
<p>74. OHCHR has worked on strengthening the capacity of States parties to submit their 
reports to treaty bodies and engage with special procedures, as well as the capacity of civil 
society to participate in these mechanisms, in the area of economic, social and cultural 
rights. 
</p>
<p>75. OHCHR encouraged and systematized inputs to ensure the inclusion of economic, 
social and cultural rights in the UPR conducted by the Human Rights Council. During the 
first seven sessions of the Human Rights Council Working Group on the UPR held in 
2008&#8211;2010, recommendations were made to a number of States concerning economic, 
social and cultural rights. Recommendations request States to ensure that national 
legislation and policies comply with international obligations; ratify relevant instruments, 
including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and its 
Optional Protocol, cooperate with special procedures United Nations human rights 
mechanisms, meet reporting obligations and implement their recommendations. 
Furthermore, recommendations were made to intensify efforts to guarantee the right to 
food; strengthen poverty alleviation strategies and policies; enhance efforts in the provision 
of adequate housing, access to clean water and sanitation; ensure access to quality 
education, especially for girls and women; and ensure equal access to health services, 
including children and migrant women, refugees and asylum-seekers, indigenous peoples 
and persons belonging to minorities. </p>


<p><b>16</b> GE.10-12597 
</p>
<p>76. Field presences have worked towards the enhancement of State party reporting and 
NGO shadow reporting in the area of economic, social and cultural rights. For example, 
OHCHR-Uganda and the Uganda Human Rights Commission co-organized a workshop 
addressed to ministries involved in treaty reporting, Uganda Human Rights Commissioners 
and NGOs on good practices in treaty reporting with the main focus on the still pending 
Ugandan initial report under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights. In 2009, the Regional Office in Eastern Africa held workshops in Tanzania, 
Djibouti and Ethiopia with government institutions, NGOs and other stakeholders, which 
resulted in States parties submitting overdue reports in the area of economic, social and 
cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>77. Several field presences have also assisted special procedures focusing on economic, 
social and cultural rights in fulfilling their mandate. For example, in September 2009 
OHCHR-Guatemala assisted the Special Rapporteur on the right to food in carrying out his 
follow-up mission to the country. In turn, OHCHR/UNAMA (Afghanistan) and the Human 
Rights Adviser in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia coordinated the UNCT&#8217;s 
responses to the Special Rapporteur on the right to food. OHCHR/UNAMA also produced 
an analysis of the measures taken by the Government to address the recommendations of 
the Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing following his country mission.  
</p>
<p>78. At the request of national stakeholders, OHCHR conducted training workshops on 
the conceptual and methodological framework on indicators developed with the treaty 
bodies (outlined in HRI/MC/2008/3). Technical assistance on human rights indicators was 
provided by OHCHR in a number of countries, including in Ecuador, Guatemala, Kenya, 
Mexico and Nepal. Following recommendations of the treaty bodies, OHCHR started the 
development of practical tools to facilitate the use of the adopted framework. OHCHR has 
encouraged further exchanges on country level experiences in using statistical and other 
structural, process and outcome indicators to foster the implementation and monitoring of 
economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>79. OHCHR continued to provide organizational, substantive and analytical support to 
the Human Rights Council mechanism of the intergovernmental Working Group on the 
Right to Development and its high-level task force on the implementation of the right to 
development, which has been engaged with global partnerships for development from the 
perspective of the right to development, through dialogue and other forms of collaboration. 
The task force has engaged in the area of development aid, jointly with several international 
and regional bodies, in issues including trade, access to essential medicines, debt relief and 
sustainability and transfer of technology. 
</p>
<p>80. OHCHR played an integral role in facilitating the 2009 Social Forum of the Human 
Rights Council. The Forum was attended by representatives of Member States, civil society 
organizations, major United Nations System Organizations and inter-governmental 
organizations. Recommendations were made on national anti-poverty programmes, 
implementation of social security programmes from a human rights perspective, negative 
impacts of economic and financial crisis on efforts to combat poverty and international 
assistance and cooperation in combating poverty. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions 
</b>81. <b>The year 2009 witnessed some important developments in the area of economic, 
social and cultural rights. The opening for signature and ratification of the Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and 
the ensuing significant number of signatures show a positive trend in closing the 
historical protection gap affecting those rights. Likewise, OHCHR successfully lead </b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>the incorporation of a right to food perspective in the international community&#8217;s 
response to the world food crisis. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The appointment of two new independent experts in the area of economic, 
social and cultural rights &#8212; water and sanitation, and cultural rights &#8212; are also 
examples of a trend aiming to devote increased attention to the clarification and 
operationalization of economic, social and cultural rights that received little attention 
in the past. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has also contributed 
to the further clarification of the application of the principle of non-discrimination to 
economic, social and cultural rights, and of the right to participate in cultural life. In 
addition, several other treaty bodies have developed substantive interpretations 
involving economic, social and cultural rights.  
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>In 2009 the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
has increased and further strengthened its work in the field of economic, social and 
cultural rights at the country, regional and international levels. The firm inclusion of 
economic, social and cultural rights as a cross-cutting component of the six thematic 
priorities and strategies of the 2010&#8211;2011 Strategic Management Plan will consolidate 
this trend.  
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Office will continue to devote efforts to achieve an even consideration of 
economic, social and cultural rights and civil and political rights. More emphasis will 
be placed on the incorporation of economic, social and cultural rights in the work plan 
of all field presences; capacity-building of OHCHR staff and other stakeholders about 
economic, social and cultural rights and the adequate coordination of efforts with 
other United Nations agencies.
