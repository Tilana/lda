3.      
The 2nd Accused and 3rd Accused persons pleaded not guilty to both the counts and proceeded with the trial. The only incriminative evidence was the confession made by the Accused persons to the police, at the caution interview. While the 1st and 3rd Accused persons admitted their statement to the police

7.      
Prosecutor after consulting with the Accused persons and the defence Counsel submitted following summary of facts. 

"Esira Nawaqalevu, Waisale Moiere and Toa Turagacati of Koronaisolo, Bua on the 6th of December 2009 robbed the Raviravi Shopping Centre of assorted items worth approximately $2711.00.

On the given date the three accused under a mango tree at Koronaisolo village planned and agreed to break into the Raviravi shop. Hence all three got one each horse and then proceeded as planned. They followed a track beside Oilimoto, they crossed two creeks until they came to a pine area. They continued on the pine road beside Tomu's shop until they reached a hill at the Vunisea bridge. They followed another pine road until they reached a hill opposite Bua District School. They tied the horses at the pine area then continued on foot to their destination.

When they reached Raviravi shop, it was dark, Toa and Waisale waited outside the fence while Esira went and checked the watchman. The watchman was still awake hence Esira cut a hole through the fence at the back, Esira managed to enter the shop however could not penetrate the inner parts of the shop without alerting the watchman. Hence they decided to assault the watchman and the wife (with a piece of timber 3 x 2) who were sleeping on the front porch of the shop. The watchman received head injury and so did the wife. The police arrived at the scene and conducted the investigation. The watchman and the wife were both hospitalized for head injuries.

The items they took:
1.      
goat cutter - $20.00
2.      
3 tin meet - $6.00

Court being convinced the plea to be unequivocal, all Accused persons were found guilty and convicted for the offence of robbery with violence.

9.      
This Court is mindful that the particulars given in the information and the summary of facts are contradicting each other. Especially the stolen goods and the amount. The amount stated in the information is $4069.80. But in the summary of facts the amount admitted was $2711.

10.     
Considering the relevant law, Section 293(1) (a) of the Penal Code prescribes a maximum sentence of imprisonment for life.

16.     
Considering all above cases it can be observed the tariff is between 5 years to 14 years. It is noted in certain cases, considering the facts of relevant cases, Courts had decided sentence much higher or lower than the tariff because that was warranted by the facts of those cases.

17.

Subject to sub-section (2), when a court sentences an offender to be imprisoned for life or for a term of 2 years or more the court must fix a period during which the offender is not eligible to be released on parole.
