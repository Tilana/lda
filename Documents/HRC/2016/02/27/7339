<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the issue of discrimination against women in law and in 
</p>
<p>practice visited Spain from 9 to 19 December 2014 at the invitation of the Government. The 
</p>
<p>Chairperson-Rapporteur, Frances Raday and Eleonora Zielinska participated in the visit. 
</p>
<p>2. In accordance with its mandate as described in Human Rights Council resolutions 
</p>
<p>15/23 and 20/6, the objective of the visit was to engage in dialogue with the Government 
</p>
<p>and other stakeholders on eliminating discrimination against women in law and in practice, 
</p>
<p>including achievements made and remaining challenges, good practices in the elimination 
</p>
<p>of laws that discriminate against women, and ways and means to advance women&#8217;s equality 
</p>
<p>and empowerment. 
</p>
<p>3. During its visit, the Working Group met with government officials at the national 
</p>
<p>and regional levels, and with representatives of civil society organizations. It visited 
</p>
<p>Madrid, Andalusia, the Basque Country and Navarra to gather first-hand information on 
</p>
<p>issues relating to discrimination against women in different contexts, including migrant 
</p>
<p>women and women from ethnic minorities. 
</p>
<p>4. The Working Group expresses its appreciation to the Government of Spain for its 
</p>
<p>invitation and its cooperation before and during the visit. The Working Group hopes to 
</p>
<p>continue to engage with the Government and other stakeholders, including civil society 
</p>
<p>actors, on the issue of women&#8217;s human rights and on the implementation of its 
</p>
<p>recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Context  
</b></p>
<p>5. A country with a rich history and strong traditions, Spain has undergone significant 
</p>
<p>and rapid societal changes in a relatively short period of time since its transition to 
</p>
<p>democracy in 1978.  
</p>
<p>6. The transition to democracy has brought noticeable changes to women&#8217;s lives. 
</p>
<p>Under the Franco regime, discrimination against women was legally and socially 
</p>
<p>entrenched. Women were subordinated to patriarchal authority and needed their husbands&#8217; 
</p>
<p>approval (<i>permiso marital</i>) for nearly every aspect of life outside the home. The role of 
</p>
<p>women was restricted to the family, as mothers and wives, and they were largely excluded 
</p>
<p>from the public, political and economic spheres.  
</p>
<p>7.  Towards the end of the Franco regime and with the transition to democracy, 
</p>
<p>milestones of progress included the abolition of <i>permiso marital</i>, in 1975; the suppression 
</p>
<p>of the law against adultery, in 1978; the lifting of the ban on the sale of contraceptives, in 
</p>
<p>1978; and reforms in family and civil law, including the legalization of divorce, in 1981. 
</p>
<p>Other steps included the legalization of abortion by the Organic Law of 1985; the ground-
</p>
<p>breaking law on gender-based violence, in 2004; the Equality Law (2007), which aims at 
</p>
<p>attaining the de facto equality of men and women in all spheres of live; and the Organic 
</p>
<p>Law on sexual and reproductive health of 2010. 
</p>
<p>8.  These changes, particularly those affecting marriage, sexual and reproductive health 
</p>
<p>and rights, have been resisted by some sectors of society, particularly the Catholic Church, 
</p>
<p>which historically has played a role as the moral guardian of society.  
</p>
<p>9. Spain has been profoundly marked by its recent history, and the legacy of its past 
</p>
<p>lingers. The human rights violations committed in the past remain to be recognized fully 
</p>
<p>and reparations to victims provided, including the cases of sexual violence, assault and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/40/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>humiliation directed against women, often in reprisal for their real or suspected affiliation 
</p>
<p>or that of their families or companions (see A/HRC/27/56/Add.1). 
</p>
<p>10. The democratization and the modernization of society have accelerated since Spain 
</p>
<p>joined the European Economic Community in 1986. The State has strived to bring its 
</p>
<p>legislative and policy frameworks into line with European Union directives and standards 
</p>
<p>in the social and economic fields. It has benefited from the assistance of the European 
</p>
<p>Union, and experienced rapid economic growth and development. An unprecedented 
</p>
<p>construction boom was witnessed throughout Spain after the late 1990s, which drew a large 
</p>
<p>flow of migrants into the country, including women domestic workers. 
</p>
<p>11. Since 2008, however, Spain has experienced a severe economic and financial crisis 
</p>
<p>that has led to one of the highest rates of unemployment in Europe. Austerity measures 
</p>
<p>taken have involved severe cuts in public spending, affecting in particular health, education, 
</p>
<p>and social services and benefits. Civil society actors have reacted to these drastic measures 
</p>
<p>with spontaneous and widespread demonstrations. In response, the authorities have taken a 
</p>
<p>number of legislative measures that have imposed restrictions on freedom of expression and 
</p>
<p>assembly. 
</p>
<p>12. The economic crisis and ensuing austerity measures have had a damaging impact on 
</p>
<p>the lives of men and women. Women are, however, an especially vulnerable, given that 
</p>
<p>they often work part-time and in care work for those in dependency, funding for which has 
</p>
<p>also been slashed.  
</p>
<p>13. Many stakeholders, including public officials in the regions, have observed a 
</p>
<p>worrying backslide in women&#8217;s social and economic empowerment, pointing to the 
</p>
<p>reduction of budgets for social services in many autonomous communities, which have 
</p>
<p>weakened institutions that provide services to women and their dependents or even forced 
</p>
<p>them to close. 
</p>
<p>14. According to some interlocutors, this trend is not only the inevitable result of the 
</p>
<p>economic crisis but also of the Government&#8217;s austerity policies, which cannot be justified 
</p>
<p>fully by the crisis.  
</p>
<p>15. International and regional human rights mechanisms have voiced concerns on the 
</p>
<p>negative impact of the austerity measures, in particular on the most vulnerable groups,1 
</p>
<p>including women. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Legislative and institutional frameworks  
</b></p>
<p>16. Spain has established impressive and wide-ranging legislative, policy and 
</p>
<p>institutional frameworks for equality and non-discrimination. This is all the more 
</p>
<p>impressive when considering the relatively short time taken to establish them following the 
</p>
<p>State&#8217;s transition to democracy. 
</p>
<p>17. Spain has ratified most key international and regional human rights and labour rights 
</p>
<p>treaties and related optional protocols, with the exception of the International Convention 
</p>
<p>on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, the 
</p>
<p>Domestic Workers Convention, 2011 (No. 189) of the International Labour Organization 
</p>
<p>(ILO) and the revised version of the European Social Charter, which provides for the 
</p>
<p>submission of a collective claim to the European Committee of Social Rights. Spain was 
</p>

</p>
<p> 1 See E/C.12/ESP/CO/5, CRPD/C/ESP/CO/1 and A/HRC/29/8. See also the report of the 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, Nils Mui&#382;nieks, following his visit to 
</p>
<p>Spain, CommDH(2013)18, 9 October 2013.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/40/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>among the first States to ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women, and has since demonstrated its commitment to women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>equality by its submission of seven periodic reports to and constructive dialogue with the 
</p>
<p>relative treaty body.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Legislative framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Constitutional protection of equality 
</b></p>
<p>18. The right to equality is established in the Constitution. Article 14 guarantees the 
</p>
<p>right to equality and non-discrimination on the grounds of sex. Article 9.2 requires public 
</p>
<p>authorities to ensure that individuals and groups enjoy de facto equality. The Constitutional 
</p>
<p>Court, in its judgement No. 12/2008, ruled on the meaning of equality, the right to non-
</p>
<p>discrimination and the affirmative action provisions in Organic Law 3/2007 on Effective 
</p>
<p>Equality.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Comprehensive protection measures against gender violence 
</b></p>
<p>19. Organic Law 1/2004 on Comprehensive Protection Measures against Gender 
</p>
<p>Violence is regarded as a conceptually ground-breaking law. It frames gender-based 
</p>
<p>violence as located &#8220;at the epicentre of a complex web of social, economic and cultural 
</p>
<p>exchanges of power between men and women&#8221;.2 The law begins with an unambiguous 
</p>
<p>statement that points to the fundamental nature of violence against women, stating that 
</p>
<p>gender violence is not a problem confined to the private sphere, but rather something that 
</p>
<p>stands as the most brutal symbol of the inequality persisting in Spanish society. It is further 
</p>
<p>described as violence directed against women for the mere fact of being women, who are 
</p>
<p>regarded by their aggressors as lacking the most basic rights to freedom, respect and power 
</p>
<p>of decision. 
</p>
<p>20. The law establishes a solid and comprehensive legal framework for protection 
</p>
<p>against and the prevention, prosecution and punishment of violence by an intimate partner 
</p>
<p>or ex-partner. It does not, however, cover other forms of gender-based violence, such as 
</p>
<p>sexual harassment and violence in public spaces, which are prohibited under the Penal 
</p>
<p>Code without the advantage of gender-specific treatment. This gap in coverage limits the 
</p>
<p>impact of the law. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Same-sex marriage law 
</b></p>
<p>21. Spain adopted the Law on Same-Sex Marriage in 2005, thereby becoming one of the 
</p>
<p>States in the world to have taken this step towards equality. The Constitutional Court 
</p>
<p>upheld the constitutionality of the law in November 2012. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Comprehensive law on effective equality 
</b></p>
<p>22. Organic Law 3/2007 on effective equality for men and women provides for a legal 
</p>
<p>framework for achieving equality and eliminating discrimination. The law begins with the 
</p>
<p>recognition that gender violence, wage discrimination, discrimination in widows&#8217; pensions, 
</p>
<p>the higher rate of female unemployment, the still scant presence of women in positions of 
</p>
<p>political, social, cultural and economic responsibility, and the problems posed when 
</p>
<p>reconciling personal, working and family life stand as evidence that the attainment of full, 
</p>
<p>effective equality between women and men is an unfinished task.

<p><b>A/HRC/29/40/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>23. The law aims at the elimination of discrimination against women in all 
</p>
<p>circumstances and in all areas of life, and specifically in the political, civil, occupational, 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural domains. It lays down measures to eliminate and correct all 
</p>
<p>forms of discrimination on the grounds of sex in the public and private sectors. It 
</p>
<p>establishes public programmes requiring gender impact studies, the development of 
</p>
<p>strategic plans and gender balanced appointments. It establishes institutional mechanisms 
</p>
<p>and requires government action in a range of areas. 
</p>
<p>24. Importantly, the law contains detailed provisions for the right to equal work 
</p>
<p>opportunities, including the prohibition of direct and indirect discrimination, equal access to 
</p>
<p>employment and career development, the reconciliation of personal, family and working 
</p>
<p>life, training, gender balance in selection and evaluation committees, and equal pay for 
</p>
<p>work of equal value. It also mandates the formulation of corporate positive action equality 
</p>
<p>plans for enterprises with more than 250 employees. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Sexual and reproductive health and rights 
</b></p>
<p>25. The purpose of Organic Law 2/2010 on Sexual and Reproductive Health and the 
</p>
<p>Voluntary Termination of Pregnancy is to guarantee fundamental sexual and reproductive 
</p>
<p>health rights, to prescribe conditions for the voluntary termination of a pregnancy, and to 
</p>
<p>set out obligations of the relevant authorities. It recognizes fundamental human rights 
</p>
<p>relating to sexual and reproductive health, and existing international and European norms. 
</p>
<p>It addresses the protection and defence of sexual and reproductive health in a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive manner, including access to secure and state-of-the-art contraceptive 
</p>
<p>methods, the training of health professionals, education-related measures in the education 
</p>
<p>system, and the inclusion of coverage by public national health system, as well as the 
</p>
<p>formulation of a national sexual and reproductive health strategy. 
</p>
<p>26. Most importantly, the law recognizes a woman&#8217;s right to autonomy during the first 
</p>
<p>14 weeks of pregnancy and the responsibility of the State to provide support and services, 
</p>
<p>clarifying that, in the early stages of pregnancy, the protection of a legal right is better 
</p>
<p>achieved &#8220;by working with the pregnant women rather than against her&#8221;. The law sets out 
</p>
<p>specific requirements to be met for voluntary termination of pregnancy, including within 14 
</p>
<p>weeks on the basis of the informed decision of the pregnant woman, and until 22 weeks on 
</p>
<p>health grounds.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. National plans of action 
</b></p>
<p>27.  As required by Organic Law 3/2007, consecutive strategic plans on equality have 
</p>
<p>been developed and implemented at the national and autonomous community levels. 
</p>
<p>Numerous strategic plans, policies and programmes to promote equality and to fight 
</p>
<p>gender-based violence have been developed. A national plan of action was launched for the 
</p>
<p>application of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security. 
</p>
<p>Two current national plans ought to be highlighted: the National Strategy for the 
</p>
<p>Eradication of Violence against Women (2013-2016) and the Strategic Plan for Equal 
</p>
<p>Opportunities (2014-2016). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. National level 
</b></p>
<p>28. At a very early stage of its transition to democracy, the State established, by Law 
</p>
<p>16/1983 of 24 October 1983, the Institute for Women, a specialized autonomous body 
</p>
<p>tasked with transforming the constitutional guarantee of gender equality into reality. In </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/40/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>2014, the body was renamed the Institute for Women and for Equal Opportunities, its new 
</p>
<p>mandate making it responsible for addressing all different forms of discrimination. 
</p>
<p>29. The institutional framework for equality has evolved, in particular since the adoption 
</p>
<p>in 2007 of the law on equality, which required the establishment of a range of bodies, 
</p>
<p>including an interministerial committee on equality between women and men, gender units 
</p>
<p>in all ministries, and a women&#8217;s participation council as a collegiate advisory body serving 
</p>
<p>as a channel for institutional participation. The Ministry for Equality was established in 
</p>
<p>2008, but was dissolved in 2010, and its functions were assigned to the Ministry of Health, 
</p>
<p>Social Affairs and Equality. 
</p>
<p>30. Several institutional and judicial protection structures have been established 
</p>
<p>pursuant to the requirement of Organic Law 1/2004 on gender violence. The Government 
</p>
<p>Delegation on Violence against Women and the State Observatory on Violence against 
</p>
<p>Women (http://estadisticasviolenciagenero.msssi.gob.es/) were created to monitor the 
</p>
<p>implementation and effectiveness of the law. The Government Delegate on Violence 
</p>
<p>against Women collects and distributes data on the scale and assessment aspects of the 
</p>
<p>measures implemented through its statistical portal. Dedicated units have been set up within 
</p>
<p>law enforcement and security agencies for the prevention of gender violence and the 
</p>
<p>enforcement of the legal measures taken. Special gender violence courts and a section of 
</p>
<p>the prosecutor&#8217;s office for cases of gender-based violence have also been created. 
</p>
<p>31. The Office of the Ombudsman is responsible for monitoring the activity of the 
</p>
<p>public administration and public authorities in an independent and impartial manner. It 
</p>
<p>plays a role in identifying problems and makes recommendations. The Office submits to 
</p>
<p>Parliament an annual report on its work covering a range of areas. The Ombudsman has 
</p>
<p>highlighted concerns with regard to the situation of women&#8217;s human rights, including 
</p>
<p>violence against women, the situation of women in prison and in alien internment centres, 
</p>
<p>the reconciliation of family and working life, and the physical tests demanded of men and 
</p>
<p>women for certain posts in government.3 
</p>
<p>32. Despite official assurances, the Working Group remains concerned that the 
</p>
<p>transformation of the Institute of Women may further weaken the focus on monitoring and 
</p>
<p>eliminating discrimination against women. Furthermore, it is not convinced that the 
</p>
<p>provision of budgets for ensuring women&#8217;s rights to equality will be adequate, and is 
</p>
<p>concerned that transparent gender budgeting will be more difficult. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Regional level 
</b></p>
<p>33. Autonomous communities have jurisdiction to establish their own legislative and 
</p>
<p>institutional frameworks for equality. During the visit, the Working Group met with the 
</p>
<p>Andalusia Institute of Women, the Institute of Family and Equality in Navarra and the 
</p>
<p>Basque Institute of Women (Emakunde) in the Basque Country. 
</p>
<p>34. The country&#8217;s high degree of decentralization poses a challenge to the State in the 
</p>
<p>fulfilment of its international human rights obligations and its constitutional responsibility 
</p>
<p>to ensure the equal enjoyment of human rights of everyone in Spain. The autonomous 
</p>
<p>communities are empowered with a wide range of legislative and executive responsibilities, 
</p>
<p>and have their own parliaments and regional governments. According to article 147 (d) of 
</p>
<p>the Constitution, each autonomous community has its own statute of autonomy as its basic 
</p>
<p>institutional law, which spells out the competences assumed and the basis for the transfer of 
</p>
<p>relevant services to it. Matters not attributed expressly to the State may belong to the 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>autonomous communities by virtue of their respective statutes; these include social policy, 
</p>
<p>education and health care. Furthermore, certain powers are distributed differently among 
</p>
<p>communities, some of which have, for example, more prerogatives than others, such as 
</p>
<p>greater fiscal autonomy and their own police force. 
</p>
<p>35. The Working Group notes that the above-described decentralization has contributed 
</p>
<p>to disparities in the enjoyment of rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>For instance, it learned that access to contraception depends on one&#8217;s place of residence, 
</p>
<p>given that autonomous communities are responsible for providing resources and services 
</p>
<p>for contraceptives and establishing guidelines on access in accordance with their policies on 
</p>
<p>sexual and reproductive health. Important discrepancies prevail between more affluent 
</p>
<p>regions in north-eastern Spain and the regions in south-western Spain, which have some of 
</p>
<p>the highest regional rates of unemployment. In recent years, stark differences have been 
</p>
<p>noted among autonomous communities in the type and scale of budgetary cuts made.4  
</p>
<p>36. The State is responsible for ensuring, through effective coordination of relevant 
</p>
<p>mechanisms and structures in all areas, uniformity of results in the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. It is also 
</p>
<p>required to provide a comprehensive description of the situation of women in law and in 
</p>
<p>practice in the autonomous communities, and the degree of conformity with Organic Law 
</p>
<p>3/2007 and its obligations under the Convention (see CEDAW/C/ESP/CO/6 and Add.1).  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Participation of women in economic and social life  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Women in the workforce 
</b></p>
<p>37. The participation of women increased in the labour market from 37.66 per cent in 
</p>
<p>1995 to 53.29 per cent in 2013 (see ECE/AC.28/2014/4).5 Women remain, however, in a 
</p>
<p>severely disadvantaged position in the labour market; their participation in full-time work is 
</p>
<p>in fact lower than the average in the European Union. Women account for 70 per cent of all 
</p>
<p>persons working part time, mainly because of their inability to find full-time employment. 
</p>
<p>Of all women in the workforce, 24.5 per cent are employed part-time, as against only 6.6 
</p>
<p>per cent of men. Furthermore, employed women are more likely than men to be working on 
</p>
<p>temporary contracts (see CEDAW/C/ESP/7-8). 
</p>
<p>38. The gender pay gap currently stands at 17.8 per cent, which is higher than the 
</p>
<p>average in the European Union.6 The gap, which has increased in recent years (see 
</p>
<p>ECE/AC.28/2014/4), is much greater for part-time and unskilled workers, and for those 
</p>
<p>working in the private sector.  
</p>
<p>39. In employment, the promotion of women to managerial positions is lower than the 
</p>
<p>average in the European Union. Segregation is horizontal; women are concentrated in the 
</p>
<p>lower-paid service sector and in jobs requiring more modest levels of qualifications. The 
</p>
<p>latest figures in the context of the 20-year regional review of the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action show that women account for 53.7 per cent of 
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p> 5 See also the national report of Spain of 29 May 2014 submitted to the Economic Commission for 
</p>
<p>Europe in view of the regional review meeting in preparation for the global 20-year review of the 
</p>

<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>those employed in the service sector, 67.8 per cent in education, 77.4 per cent in health and 
</p>
<p>social services, 88 per cent in domestic services and 68.3 per cent in travel agencies.7  
</p>
<p>40. The gender gap in wages and promotion contrast starkly with the high education 
</p>
<p>level of women, whose rate of enrolment in tertiary education is higher than that of men.8 
</p>
<p>The better education of women has yet to be adequately translated into better employment, 
</p>
<p>better remuneration or fair occupation in decision-making positions. 
</p>
<p>41. Women&#8217;s unpaid care burden constitutes a severe structural barrier to achieving 
</p>
<p>equal opportunities in employment. Women spend 40 per cent more time daily than men in 
</p>
<p>unpaid work.9 Women enjoy the right to paid maternity leave and parents to child-care 
</p>
<p>leave, in accordance with international standards. The extension of reduced working hours 
</p>
<p>to parents of children under 12 years of age (previously under 8years of age) is a welcome 
</p>
<p>step. 
</p>
<p>42. Spain has approximately 569,100 domestic workers, one of the highest numbers in 
</p>
<p>Europe.10 Domestic workers are predominantly migrant women, many of whom are 
</p>
<p>indigenous women from Latin America. Law 27/2011 and Royal Decree 1620/2011 have 
</p>
<p>brought important improvements to the protection of their rights, including greater job 
</p>
<p>security and better working conditions, inclusion in the social security system and the 
</p>
<p>guarantee of a minimal wage. The working conditions for live-in domestic workers are 
</p>
<p>nonetheless harsh; employers may deduct up to 30 per cent of the total salary (over the 
</p>
<p>minimum wage) for food and accommodation. Furthermore, domestic workers are still 
</p>
<p>excluded from unemployment insurance benefits.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Women in economic decision-making 
</b></p>
<p>43. The law on equality of 2007 recommends that the State endeavour to reach gender 
</p>
<p>balance in the boards of directors of large companies. According to article 75 of the law, 
</p>
<p>regarding the participation of women in the boards of directors of mercantile companies, 
</p>
<p>companies that are required to present unabridged financial statements of income should 
</p>
<p>endeavour to reach a balanced presence of women and men on their boards of directors 
</p>
<p>within eight years of the entry of the law into effect. According to information provided by 
</p>
<p>the Government, in the top 35 companies quoted on the Spanish stock exchange (IBEX 35), 
</p>
<p>in 2014, 18.2 per cent of corporate board members were women, up from the 12.1 per cent 
</p>
<p>recorded three years earlier. The Working Group was, however, informed that since the 
</p>
<p>commitment to achieve the goal of 40 per cent of women on corporate boards is voluntary, 
</p>
<p>some companies do not take any particular measures to increase the number of women on 
</p>
<p>their boards. Law 31/2014 of 3 December 2014 amending the Corporations Act does not 
</p>
<p>address this issue.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Impact of austerity measures 
</b></p>
<p>44. The austerity measures introduced in response to the economic and financial crisis 
</p>
<p>have had a severe and disproportionate impact on women.

</p>
<p>45. The minimal wage freeze has had a disproportionate impact on women who are 
</p>
<p>concentrated in lower-paid sectors. Cuts and restrictions in the implementation of Law 
</p>
<p>39/2006 on personal autonomy and dependent care have put an extra burden on families, 
</p>
<p>and in particular on women, to assume care functions. A total of 83 per cent of those caring 
</p>
<p>for dependent persons are middle-aged women relatives (generally, mothers, daughters or 
</p>
<p>wives).11  
</p>
<p>46. There have been reductions in child-centred services, such as kindergartens and 
</p>
<p>school canteens, which have thus privatized the burden of care. Single-parent families, an 
</p>
<p>overwhelming majority of which are headed by a woman, have been particularly affected: 
</p>
<p>45 per cent of children in such families are in fact at risk of poverty. At the same time, the 
</p>
<p>right of parents to choose flexi-work has been revoked. 
</p>
<p>47. The Working Group observes that the above-mentioned measures have heightened 
</p>
<p>the care barrier to the participation of women in the labour force and in career promotion. 
</p>
<p>In its opinion, it is important to provide a social protection floor for care, in particular for 
</p>
<p>full-time working parents, and to synchronize school days and holidays with working time. 
</p>
<p>These are essential measures not only for women to have access to the labour market but 
</p>
<p>also for the sustainable recovery of the economy. 
</p>
<p>48. Civil society stakeholders brought to the attention of the Working Group the 
</p>
<p>successive labour measures of recent years, which have resulted in an increasingly 
</p>
<p>precarious labour market by facilitating dismissals and empowering employers to take 
</p>
<p>unilateral decisions. Reportedly, employers have transformed full-time jobs to part-time 
</p>
<p>ones with overtime hours in order to avoid employment costs. Women have suffered most 
</p>
<p>from this practice. Law 3/2012 on urgent measures to reform the labour market was 
</p>
<p>adopted despite the strong opposition of different forces throughout the country. The law 
</p>
<p>has resulted in a deterioration in working conditions, which has led to more precarious 
</p>
<p>work and temporary jobs, as well as a decline in wages and in the power of labour unions.12  
</p>
<p>49. Although the unemployment for women has more than doubled since 2005, by 2013 
</p>
<p>the gap between men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s unemployment had narrowed to the current levels of 
</p>
<p>27.02 per cent for women and 25.79 per cent for men.13 According to the information 
</p>
<p>received, measures to boost employment after the economic crisis have largely focused on 
</p>
<p>male employment sectors.  
</p>
<p>50. Vulnerable groups of women have been particularly affected. The Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Persons with Disabilities has expressed concerns that employment policies in 
</p>
<p>Spain do not include a comprehensive gender perspective and that unemployment, 
</p>
<p>inactivity and training rates are significantly worse for women than for men with 
</p>
<p>disabilities (CRPD/C/ESP/CO/1, para. 21). Older women are among the most vulnerable 
</p>
<p>groups: their average pension is 38 per cent lower than men&#8217;s as a result of less 
</p>
<p>participation in the labour force, lower wages and shorter contributing periods in 
</p>
<p>employment.14

<p><b> D. Government response 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Working Group was encouraged to learn of the various measures that the 
</p>
<p>Government has taken or plans to take. Royal Decree-Law 16/2013 adopted on 20 
</p>
<p>December 2013 reinstated the ban on overtime, except in cases of <i>force majeure</i>, for 
</p>
<p>workers employed under part-time contracts, with additional hours to be remunerated as 
</p>
<p>regular hours and reflected in the social security system. The Working Group welcomes the 
</p>
<p>programmes conducted by the Institute of Women and for Equal Opportunities for women 
</p>
<p>in vulnerable situations, including victims of gender violence, women at risk of social 
</p>
<p>exclusion, unemployed women, and rural women (with a view to improving their 
</p>
<p>employability and capacity for self-employment). It is keen to see evidence of the impact of 
</p>
<p>these measures. 
</p>
<p>52. The Working Group welcomes the Strategic Plan for Equal Opportunities (2014-
</p>
<p>2016) aimed at combating inequalities that persist in the field of labour and wages. One of 
</p>
<p>its strategic objectives is to promote equality of opportunities between women and men in 
</p>
<p>access to the labour market, the retention of jobs, wage equality and improved working 
</p>
<p>conditions. In addition, the Working Group welcomes that the approval of the special plan 
</p>
<p>(2014-2016), which will focus on overcoming the gender gap in wages and salaries, and the 
</p>
<p>national plan for social inclusion (2013-2016). 
</p>
<p><b> V. Education, culture and stereotypes 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Role of education 
</b></p>
<p>53. The important role of education in bringing changes in attitudes and behaviour 
</p>
<p>towards equality between men and women is reflected in Organic Law 1/2004, which 
</p>
<p>contains specific sections on sensitization in education, advertising and the media. The law 
</p>
<p>mandates the teaching of the equality of men and women as objectives of the education 
</p>
<p>system. Education authorities have the obligation to ensure that sexist and discriminatory 
</p>
<p>stereotypes are removed from all educational materials. Similarly, the law on equality of 
</p>
<p>2007 contains provisions on education for equality and the responsibility of the mass media 
</p>
<p>in upholding the principle of gender equality. The Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women has called upon Spain to strengthen its efforts to eliminate 
</p>
<p>stereotypical images and attitudes regarding the roles of women and men in the family and 
</p>
<p>in society and implement targeted programmes in the education system, including human 
</p>
<p>rights education and the dissemination of the Convention, the revision of school textbooks 
</p>
<p>and curricula, and the training of teachers (CEDAW/C/ESP/CO/6, para. 18). The Working 
</p>
<p>Group was informed by stakeholders that textbooks have still not been revised in many 
</p>
<p>autonomous communities. 
</p>
<p>54. Civil society organizations also reported in a shadow report on the period 2008-
</p>
<p>2013, submitted to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, on 
</p>
<p>the impact of education budget cuts in various autonomous communities on the right of 
</p>
<p>women and girls to education. For example, in Navarra, the only specific and specialized 
</p>
<p>course on gender is at serious risk of disappearing from the public university. In the view of 
</p>
<p>the Working Group, it is important to address the disparity noted in women&#8217;s educational 
</p>
<p>achievements and their access to economic opportunities in schools by removing 
</p>
<p>stereotypes in the educational system and by supplying career advisory services for girls.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/40/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p><b> B. Education for citizenship and human rights  
</b></p>
<p>55. The State incorporated democratic citizenship and human rights education into the 
</p>
<p>educational system for the first time through organic law 2/2006 on education, in May 
</p>
<p>2006. &#8220;Education for citizenship and human rights&#8221; was then introduced as a compulsory 
</p>
<p>subject at both elementary and secondary levels, focusing on fundamental values such as 
</p>
<p>human rights, gender equality, non-discrimination and respect for diversity. In February 
</p>
<p>2009, the Supreme Court ruled that the law was constitutional. 
</p>
<p>56. The Working Group notes that some State officials and many civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations regard the course on citizenship and human rights as an essential means for 
</p>
<p>educating boys and girls that universal human rights values and women&#8217;s human rights are 
</p>
<p>an inalienable part of civic ethics. 
</p>
<p>57. In 2013, in the Law on the Improvement of the Quality of Education, the core 
</p>
<p>syllabus course &#8220;Education for citizenship and human rights&#8221; was replaced with the 
</p>
<p>subjects &#8220;Civic and social values&#8221; in primary schools and &#8220;Ethical values&#8221; in secondary 
</p>
<p>schools as optional alternatives to the subject of religion, at the discretion of parents or 
</p>
<p>legal guardians. The Working Group regards this change as a retrogressive measure in the 
</p>
<p>overall effort to eliminate discriminatory gender stereotypes and empower girls, and does 
</p>
<p>not consider the teaching of gender in social and natural sciences courses an adequate 
</p>
<p>solution. Freedom of religion cannot, as independent United Nations human rights experts 
</p>
<p>have consistently clarified,15 be used to justify discrimination against women, and therefore 
</p>
<p>should not be regarded as a justifiable reason for marginalizing the teaching of women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>right to equality. 
</p>
<p>58. During its visit, the Working Group appreciated the opportunity to meet with 
</p>
<p>representative of the Episcopal Conference and to learn of its impressive programme to 
</p>
<p>combat trafficking in women. It was informed that women were relegated to a secondary 
</p>
<p>role in the Church, and that the Church does not teach feminist theology. This contention 
</p>
<p>was refuted by the representative of the Episcopal Conference, who attended 
</p>
<p>(unconventionally) the final debriefing with the Government, and claimed that women were 
</p>
<p>promoted in the Church and that feminist theology did not, in any case, exist. In the light of 
</p>
<p>the Church&#8217;s conservative approach to women, it is incumbent on the Government to 
</p>
<p>ensure that the core syllabus in the educational system does not allow the opting out from 
</p>
<p>citizenship studies in favour of courses on religion. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Education of Roma girls 
</b></p>
<p>59. The challenge of improving the educational level and employability of Roma girls is 
</p>
<p>urgent. 
</p>
<p>60. Although the Government has reported considerable improvement in preschool and 
</p>
<p>primary school education of Roma children through the National Strategy for the Social 
</p>
<p>Inclusion of Roma in Spain (2012-2020), the gender gap in secondary and higher education 
</p>
<p>is broad. Though Roma girls achieve better results than Roma boys, only 39.3 per cent of 
</p>
<p>them &#8211; as against 60.7 per cent of Roma boys &#8211; enter compulsory secondary education 
</p>
<p>(CEDAW/C/ESP/7-8, para. 152). According to information gathered through the National 
</p>
<p>Strategy, while 84.5 per cent of Roma boys complete secondary education, only 71.7 per 
</p>
<p>cent of Roma girls do. In higher education, the participation of Roma girls is alarmingly 
</p>
<p>scarce. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 15 See A/HRC/4/21 and general comment No. 28 of the Human Rights Committee. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/40/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>61. The Working Group welcomes the above-mentioned National Strategy, in particular 
</p>
<p>its cross-cutting gender focus and the fact that some autonomous communities, such as 
</p>
<p>Andalusia, have adopted successful integration programmes. It was, however, informed 
</p>
<p>that, in many places, schools are isolated and ghettoized. The Working Group emphasizes 
</p>
<p>the importance of monitoring and reviewing strategies for social inclusion, and of involving 
</p>
<p>the Roma community when designing integration policies for girls&#8217; education, thus 
</p>
<p>avoiding ghettoization. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Stereotypes and the media 
</b></p>
<p>62. Negative gender stereotypes undermine the status of women in all spheres of life. 
</p>
<p>Official statistics point to the large gender gap in the world of sports, culture and academic 
</p>
<p>life.16 In the media, traditionalist and sexist roles, sexist advertising and resistance to 
</p>
<p>reporting women&#8217;s success in sports are still widespread. Interlocutors criticized the use of 
</p>
<p>discriminatory language in the courts, the imposition on women of a secondary role in the 
</p>
<p>Church, the scarcer presence of women artists in exhibitions and awards and their severe 
</p>
<p>underrepresentation in the Academy of Sciences and the governing bodies of sports 
</p>
<p>federations. The Working Group noted with concern the multiple discriminatory 
</p>
<p>stereotypes to which women in vulnerable situations, including rural women, women with 
</p>
<p>disabilities, women in poverty, migrant women and lesbians, are subject. It was also 
</p>
<p>informed of the existence of a television show <i>Palabra de gitano</i> (&#8220;Gypsy&#8217;s Honour&#8221;) that 
</p>
<p>portrays women in a degrading and stereotyped way. 
</p>
<p>63. The Working Group welcomes the ground-breaking law of 2004 on gender-based 
</p>
<p>violence, which empowers public institutions that defend the interests of women to apply to 
</p>
<p>the courts for the withdrawal of advertising material that depicts women in a degrading 
</p>
<p>manner. It welcomes the establishment of an anti-sexist advertising observatory by the 
</p>
<p>Andalusia Institute of Women and the Audiovisual Observatory. The Working Group was 
</p>
<p>also pleased to learn that the Institute of Women has obtained a court injunction for the 
</p>
<p>withdrawal of sexist advertising by a commercial airline. It also welcomes the law on 
</p>
<p>science, technology and innovation, which contains provisions for gender balance in all 
</p>
<p>areas of science, technology and innovation; the 28 non-binding resolutions and two reports 
</p>
<p>of the Equality Committee of the Congress of Deputies on gender stereotypes in the media, 
</p>
<p>sports and digital communications; and the government events held to raise awareness, such 
</p>
<p>as <i>Ellas crean</i> (&#8220;Women create&#8221;) and <i>Carrera de la Mujer</i> (&#8220;Race of women&#8221;), to promote 
</p>
<p>the role of women in culture and sports (see CEDAW/C/ESP/7-8).  
</p>
<p>64. Nevertheless, civil society stakeholders reported the absence of effective sanctions 
</p>
<p>for violations of the law by the media. It is therefore important to back the excellent 
</p>
<p>existing provisions of law and policy with effective sanctions. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Working Group welcomes the progressive legislative framework in Organic 
</p>
<p>Law 1/2004 to prosecute perpetrators and to protect women in cases of violence committed 
</p>
<p>by current or former partners, and the comprehensive framework of multisectoral 
</p>
<p>prevention, protection and assistance established in 2005. It appreciates the Gender 
</p>
<p>Violence Response system (VioGen) developed by the Ministry of the Interior, an 
</p>
<p>innovative monitoring and follow-up database for use by law enforcement agencies 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 16 See the national report of Spain (see footnote 5). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/40/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>nationwide. The system is a powerful tool in the process of risk assessment aimed at the 
</p>
<p>protection of victims of domestic violence. It communicates with the databases of certain 
</p>
<p>autonomous communities, coordinating victim protection orders issued by regional 
</p>
<p>authorities. Furthermore, a link to VioGen is provided in the training of judges specializing 
</p>
<p>in gender violence with a view to encouraging its use by the judiciary. 
</p>
<p>66. The protective measures of the law do not, regrettably, cover the full range of 
</p>
<p>gender-based violence, other than intimate partner violence, including, for instance, 
</p>
<p>violence by carers, police violence, violence in public spaces, the workplace and schools, 
</p>
<p>and the stalking of women human rights defenders. The Working Group therefore 
</p>
<p>welcomes the adoption of the National Strategy for the Eradication of Violence against 
</p>
<p>Women (2013-2016), which contains a specific focus on other forms of violence, such as 
</p>
<p>trafficking in women and girls for sexual exploitation, female genital mutilation, sexual 
</p>
<p>assault and forced marriages, and includes initiatives to reform the Penal Code. 
</p>
<p>67. Despite the considerable efforts made over the years in law, policy and 
</p>
<p>administration, the prevalence of domestic violence remains alarming: in 2014, an average 
</p>
<p>of 347 cases of partner violence were reported every day.17 In 2014, 54 women were killed 
</p>
<p>by current or former partners, of whom 16 had registered complaints and four had 
</p>
<p>protection orders. According to figures released by the Ministry of Health, Social Services 
</p>
<p>and Equality, for 2015, nine victims had been registered as at 6 April 2015. According to a 
</p>
<p>survey on violence against women issued by the Ministry in 2015, 67.8 per cent of victims 
</p>
<p>do not report violence experienced.  
</p>
<p>68. Those most vulnerable to gender-based violence include girls, women with 
</p>
<p>disabilities, migrant women and women victims of human trafficking. The incidence of 
</p>
<p>psychological violence and subjugation among girls between 16 and 19 years of age is 25 
</p>
<p>per cent, as against 9.6 per cent for other age groups. Among women with disabilities, 23.3 
</p>
<p>per cent are reported to have suffered gender-based violence (compared to 15.1 per cent for 
</p>
<p>women without disabilities). The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
</p>
<p>recommended the adoption of integrated policies to combat violence against women and 
</p>
<p>girls with disabilities (see CRPD/C/ESP/CO/1). Owing to harsh living conditions and the 
</p>
<p>fear of expulsion, migrant women face greater difficulties in reporting domestic violence 
</p>
<p>and in their access to care services (see CERD/C/ESP/CO/18-20). 
</p>
<p>69. All interlocutors regarded trafficking of women for sexual exploitation as a tragic 
</p>
<p>social issue and were concerned at the lack of implementation of existing protocols for 
</p>
<p>identifying trafficking victims, particularly in cases of expulsion. The Government 
</p>
<p>informed the Working Group that it had continued to work on improving the mechanisms 
</p>
<p>for identifying potential victims of trafficking and their referral to specialized services and 
</p>
<p>assistance. 
</p>
<p>70. Cases of children killed by violent men, sometimes after the woman&#8217;s repeated 
</p>
<p>requests for protection and for cancellation of visitation rights or custody, continue to be 
</p>
<p>reported. Some 20 children are said to have been killed by their fathers during visitation 
</p>
<p>meetings between 2008 and 2014. In May 2013, the Government decided to publish an 
</p>
<p>official record of children who have died or been left an orphan as a result of gender 
</p>
<p>violence. According to the Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality, 10 victims 
</p>
<p>have since been recorded. 
</p>
<p>71. In the tragic case of Gonzalez, in which an abusive father, during an unsupervised 
</p>
<p>visit, murdered his daughter and then took his own life, the Committee on the Elimination 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 17 According to the annual report for 2014 presented by El Observatorio contra la Violencia Dom&#233;stica 
</p>
<p>in March 2015, a total of 126,742 cases were reported in 2014 (124,894 in 2013).  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/40/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>of Discrimination against Women found that, by ruling to allow unsupervised visits without 
</p>
<p>giving sufficient consideration to the background of domestic violence, the Spanish 
</p>
<p>authorities had failed to fulfil their due diligence obligations under the Convention 
</p>
<p>(CEDAW/C/58/D/47/2012, para. 9.7) The Committee issued recommendations to the State 
</p>
<p>in its ruling, including on adequate restitution for the mother. It addressed the need to 
</p>
<p>consider any history of domestic violence when determining visitation schedules in order to 
</p>
<p>ensure that they do not endanger women or children and to ensure mandatory training for 
</p>
<p>judges and administrative personnel on domestic violence, including training on gender 
</p>
<p>stereotypes. 
</p>
<p>72. The Working Group is concerned that, in the above case, the clear recommendations 
</p>
<p>made by the Committee were not heeded by the Government; indeed, its response to the 
</p>
<p>Committee suggests a lack of understanding of the State&#8217;s responsibility of due diligence. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, during its visit, the Working Group was informed by numerous stakeholders 
</p>
<p>that law enforcement officials, including social workers, police and judges, continue to fail 
</p>
<p>to give proper weight to women&#8217;s evidence regarding the risk of violence, for them and 
</p>
<p>their children, owing to the persistence of negative stereotyping of women and 
</p>
<p>insufficiently effective gender-sensitive capacity building. Women victims continue to be 
</p>
<p>discredited as manipulative and are often accused of making false reports. This may affect 
</p>
<p>the issuance of protection orders, which are given in the case of 59 per cent of the requests 
</p>
<p>that reach the court. This reflects a marked decrease in the number of protection orders 
</p>
<p>issued from 2008, when 73.3 per cent were issued. 
</p>
<p>73. The Working Group was also informed by various stakeholders that the best 
</p>
<p>interests of the child are often interpreted as requiring a normalization of the relationship 
</p>
<p>with the father, and that fathers are frequently granted visitation rights and custody, in spite 
</p>
<p>of evidence that they have committed acts of domestic violence. In accordance with article 
</p>
<p>66 of Organic Law 1/2004, a judge may order the suspension of child visiting rights in the 
</p>
<p>case of persons accused of gender violence. Where there is a final conviction for domestic 
</p>
<p>violence, the Government asserts that rules seek to ensure that the parent do not have any 
</p>
<p>visiting, relationship or communication privileges before the extinction of their criminal 
</p>
<p>responsibility and that, if they are granted to them exceptionally, judges must take the 
</p>
<p>measures necessary to guarantee the security, integrity and recovery of the child and of the 
</p>
<p>other parent. In the view of the Working Group, this gives too little protection to children of 
</p>
<p>abusive fathers and points out that, in the Gonzales case itself, although there was ample 
</p>
<p>evidence of domestic violence, the assailant was never convicted. The Working Group is 
</p>
<p>cognizant of the current legislative initiative regarding the regulation of guardianship, 
</p>
<p>visitation and custody for accused and convicted abusers It was informed by the 
</p>
<p>Government that the law would restrict judicial power to allow unsupervised contact with 
</p>
<p>children by fathers accused or convicted of domestic violence. The Working Group calls 
</p>
<p>for the legislative reform to be introduced as soon as possible with the promised safeguards 
</p>
<p>to protect children from the risk of violence. 
</p>
<p>74. Additionally, according to numerous stakeholders, the so-called &#8220;parental alienation 
</p>
<p>syndrome&#8221; continues to be used to withdraw child custody from the mother and to grant it 
</p>
<p>to a father accused of domestic violence claiming custody on this basis, in many cases with 
</p>
<p>the support of a fathers&#8217; rights organization. According to the stakeholders, &#8220;parental 
</p>
<p>alienation syndrome&#8221; is still a recognized condition, despite the ruling issued in 2013 by the 
</p>
<p>General Council of the Judiciary, which in its guide clearly rejected the validity of this 
</p>
<p>pseudo-scientific theory and firmly opposed its use in cases of gender-based violence. 
</p>
<p>75. The Working Group cannot overstate its concern that the lessons of the above-
</p>
<p>mentioned case have not been fully integrated into law and into practice. It is most urgent 
</p>
<p>that all the recommendations of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
</p>
<p>against Women be implemented fully and immediately. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/40/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>76. The Working Group was informed of the deteriorating situation nationwide in 
</p>
<p>protective services for women victims of domestic violence, including a reduction in the 
</p>
<p>availability of shelters for women and children. The decision to reduce the number of 
</p>
<p>shelters is deeply regrettable given the seriousness of the problem. The Working Group was 
</p>
<p>subsequently informed by the Government that regional authorities were responsible for 
</p>
<p>ensuring comprehensive assistance and that it had maintained constant its funding of 
</p>
<p>autonomous communities to enable them to meet their responsibilities towards women 
</p>
<p>victims and their children. Some government officials did, however, reiterated their concern 
</p>
<p>that a simple budget allocation was not enough to maintain the standard of social services 
</p>
<p>and benefits per capita in the face of the much greater need for support in times of austerity. 
</p>
<p>The Working Group welcomes the exceptional protection provided for victims of domestic 
</p>
<p>violence observed in Andalusia, which, despite the broad budget cuts made, had maintained 
</p>
<p>the number and quality of shelters. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Health and safety 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Sexual and reproductive health and rights 
</b></p>
<p>77. Organic Law 2/2010 on sexual reproductive health and the voluntary interruption of 
</p>
<p>pregnancy is a major step in guaranteeing women&#8217;s right to the highest standard of health 
</p>
<p>and autonomy. The law was intended, as affirmed in the preamble thereto, to provide 
</p>
<p>protection for women&#8217;s sexual and reproductive rights as a part of gender equality and of a 
</p>
<p>broader public policy on sexual and reproductive health. The Working Group is, however, 
</p>
<p>concerned that the law allows for conscientious objection by medical professionals, thereby 
</p>
<p>obstructing access to legal abortion - as is the case in Navarra, where no abortion has been 
</p>
<p>performed since 1986. Inadequately regulated conscientious objection constitutes a barrier 
</p>
<p>for women when exercising their right to have access to sexual and reproductive health 
</p>
<p>services. The jurisprudence of human rights treaty bodies states that, where conscientious 
</p>
<p>objection is permitted, States still have an obligation to ensure that women&#8217;s access to 
</p>
<p>reproductive health services is not limited and that conscientious objection is a personal, 
</p>
<p>not institutional, practice (see E/C.12/POL/CO/5, CEDAW/C/POL/CO/6 and 
</p>
<p>CEDAW/C/SVK/CO/4). 
</p>
<p>78. In addition, the Working Group is concerned that, under existing legislation, girls 
</p>
<p>younger than 16 years of age have no access to legal abortion without parental consent, 
</p>
<p>even when notifying the parents results in the clear and present danger of domestic 
</p>
<p>violence.  
</p>
<p>79. The Working Group is also concerned about recent legislative attempts to reverse 
</p>
<p>the law of 2010. In 2013, a draft bill was adopted by the Council of Ministers, limiting 
</p>
<p>abortions to cases in which the woman&#8217;s physical and mental health is endangered or the 
</p>
<p>pregnancy is the result of rape. The proposal was withdrawn following public outcry. 
</p>
<p>80. A draft law dated 18 February 2015 proposes to make abortion for girls 16 and 17 
</p>
<p>years of age and for women with reduced legal capacity dependent on the consent of 
</p>
<p>parents, caretakers or legal guardians. The Working Group calls for the withdrawal of the 
</p>
<p>draft, which is incompatible with international human rights standards. In this regard, the 
</p>
<p>Working Group recalls that, at the International Conference on Population and 
</p>
<p>Development, held in Cairo in 1994, participants encouraged Governments to remove legal 
</p>
<p>barriers preventing women and adolescent girls from access to safe abortion, including 
</p>
<p>revising restrictions within existing abortion laws (E/CN.9/2014/4, para. 81).  
</p>
<p>81. Requiring third-party consent for girls under the age of 18 runs counter to the 
</p>
<p>obligations of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. In this regard, the Committee on </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/40/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>the Rights of the Child has emphasized the right of the child to confidential counselling and 
</p>
<p>to access to information without parental or guardian consent. In its general comment No. 
</p>
<p>15 on the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health, the 
</p>
<p>Committee recommended that States review and consider allowing children to consent to 
</p>
<p>certain medical treatments and interventions without the permission of a parent, caregiver 
</p>
<p>or guardian, such as HIV testing and sexual and reproductive health services, including 
</p>
<p>education and guidance on sexual health, contraception and safe abortion. The Convention 
</p>
<p>on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities guarantees full and equal legal capacity to 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities, recognizing that the denial of legal capacity to persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities has, in many cases, led to their being deprived of many fundamental rights, 
</p>
<p>including reproductive rights. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Universal health care 
</b></p>
<p>82. A legislative amendment of 2012 on measures &#8220;to guarantee the sustainability of the 
</p>
<p>national health system and to improve the quality and security of benefits&#8221; excluded 
</p>
<p>migrants in an irregular situation from universal health-care coverage. Although the 
</p>
<p>Government affirms that free care is still provided for emergency assistance, accidents and 
</p>
<p>prenatal and postnatal care, civil society organizations allege that the amendment has had a 
</p>
<p>disparate impact on migrant women, who are deprived of free medical services, which can 
</p>
<p>play a vital role in the detection of gender-based violence.  
</p>
<p>83. The Working Group welcomes the fact that a number of regional governments 
</p>
<p>(Andalusia, Asturias, the Basque Country and Catalonia) have petitioned the Constitutional 
</p>
<p>Court to invalidate the amendment and that Andalusia has established a mechanism to 
</p>
<p>maintain free and universal access to health care. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Participation of women in political and public life  
</b></p>
<p>84. According to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, with regard to the number of women in 
</p>
<p>the national parliament, Spain is above both regional and world averages.18 The law of 2007 
</p>
<p>on equality established a quota of 40 per cent for political representation of each sex, 
</p>
<p>resulting in a significant increase in women&#8217;s participation in parliament at both the central 
</p>
<p>and local levels. In the national parliament, 36 per cent are women. Total parity was 
</p>
<p>achieved at one stage in the Council of Ministers when, for the first time in Spanish history, 
</p>
<p>women occupied the posts of deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence. The 
</p>
<p>proportion of women ministers in the Government has since dropped to only 28.6 per cent 
</p>
<p>(four out of 14 members, including a deputy Prime Minister). 
</p>
<p>85. At the local level, the proportion of women mayors increased from 15.16 per cent in 
</p>
<p>2007 to 17.17 per cent in 2013. Four out of 17 autonomous communities have women as 
</p>
<p>presidents. Women in autonomous community regional governments decreased from 39.7 
</p>
<p>per cent in 2008 to 34.2 per cent in 2013. Funding of equality institutions at the regional 
</p>
<p>level have been reduced by 32 per cent. According to shadow report on the period 2008-
</p>
<p>2013 submitted by civil society organizations to the Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women (see para. 54 above), Andalusia and the Basque Country, 
</p>
<p>which have maintained their budgeting levels, are exceptions to this trend,. 
 
</p>
<p>86. Women began to enter the judiciary in the late 1970s; today, there are as many 
</p>
<p>women judges as men. The actual number of women at the highest levels of the judiciary 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 18 See www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/40/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>remains, however, extremely low in the Supreme Court, of 70 judges, only 12 are women; 
</p>
<p>there are no women presidents in the chambers of the <i>Audiencia Nacional </i>(National Court); 
</p>
<p>and only six out of 52 presidents in the high courts of justice are women. The Working 
</p>
<p>Group was informed that the low number of appointments of women to the highest levels of 
</p>
<p>the judiciary was due to their late entry into the judicial hierarchy.  
</p>
<p>87. The Working Group welcomes the gender parity achieved in the composition of the 
</p>
<p>General Council of the Judiciary (10 of 20 members) and the fact that the Prosecutor 
</p>
<p>General is a woman. 
</p>
<p>88. Similarly, in the Foreign Office, there is a lower number of promotions of women to 
</p>
<p>the position of ambassador, despite the fact that many are formally qualified.  
</p>
<p><b> IX. Access to justice  
</b></p>
<p>89. Numerous stakeholders explained to the Working Group that Law 10/2012 on 
</p>
<p>determining costs in the area of administration of justice, which imposes heavy fees for 
</p>
<p>filing actions in court, has raised a serious barrier to litigation in administrative, civil, 
</p>
<p>family and some labour cases. As reported by the General Council of the Judiciary in June 
</p>
<p>2013, there has been a significant decline in the number of cases brought to the courts in 
</p>
<p>recent years.  
</p>
<p>90. In this regard, Royal Decree Law 3/2013 amending the rules on fees in the justice 
</p>
<p>system governed by law 10/2012 introduced measures to reduce fees or to extend free legal 
</p>
<p>assistance to certain categories, such as victims of gender-based violence and human 
</p>
<p>trafficking. The Working Group welcomes the amendment and suggests that it should be 
</p>
<p>extended to all claims on gender discrimination, including labour and family issues. 
</p>
<p><b> X. Good practices 
</b></p>
<p>91. Strong political will and investment have led to the construction of a solid legislative 
</p>
<p>framework and institutional infrastructure across sectors in government and State 
</p>
<p>institutions. 
</p>
<p>92. Legal measures have been taken to improve the protection of the rights and working 
</p>
<p>conditions of domestic workers, including inclusion in the social security system. 
</p>
<p>93. Continuous efforts have led to high level of attendance of Roma girls in pre-school 
</p>
<p>and elementary education. 
</p>
<p>94. Public institutions in defence of women&#8217;s rights are empowered by law to bring 
</p>
<p>cases of the use of degrading images of women in advertising to court; cases have been 
</p>
<p>brought successfully by the Institute of Women. 
</p>
<p>95. Regarding gender-based violence, the gathering of statistics is systematic, 
</p>
<p>comprehensive, up-to-date and accessible in a transparent manner. The VioGen system of 
</p>
<p>the Ministry of the Interior is an effective monitoring tool.  
</p>
<p>96. In the area of women&#8217;s sexual and reproductive health and rights, a progressive legal 
</p>
<p>framework for a woman&#8217;s right of choice during the first 14 weeks of pregnancy has been 
</p>
<p>established. 
</p>
<p>97. A quota system of gender balance has contributed to the maintenance of a high 
</p>
<p>degree of representation of women in the national parliament. </p>

<p><b> XI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>98.<b> The efforts of the State to integrate women into public, political and economic 
</b></p>
<p><b>life and its commitment to eradicate domestic violence and to protect </b>women&#8217;s sexual 
</p>
<p><b>and reproductive health and rights have been impressive, and progress has been 
</b></p>
<p><b>remarkable, particularly in the light of the </b>country&#8217;s <b>historical, social and cultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>background. An impressive legal and institutional infrastructure for gender equality 
</b></p>
<p><b>has been put in place, which has brought significant gains for women. 
</b></p>
<p>99.<b> These achievements, however, are still at risk of retrogression. The culture of 
</b></p>
<p>&#8220;<b>machismo</b>&#8221;<b> and the social influence of patriarchal religious institutions, combined 
</b></p>
<p><b>with the austerity policies implemented in the context of economic and financial crisis 
</b></p>
<p><b>of recent years, have had an effect of restricting many women to traditionalist and 
</b></p>
<p><b>subordinate roles and undermined their status in economic, social, political and public 
</b></p>
<p><b>life. A significant number of interlocutors reported that austerity measures had forced 
</b></p>
<p><b>women to assume greater responsibility for care work. A disproportionate number of 
</b></p>
<p><b>women are part-time workers unable to find full-time employment. 
</b></p>
<p>100.<b> Measures crucial for the socioeconomic empowerment of women, including 
</b></p>
<p>care services and women&#8217;s equality institutions, have been reduced in many parts of 
</p>
<p><b>the country. Human rights need special protection in times of economic crisis and, as 
</b></p>
<p><b>underlined by the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, all efforts 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be made to assess and limit the negative impact of budgetary cuts on the most 
</b></p>
<p><b>vulnerable groups. An assessment of the impact of austerity measures on gender 
</b></p>
<p><b>issues should be conducted in a transparent and inclusive manner. 
</b></p>
<p>101.<b> Despite progressive legislation to combat intimate partner violence, violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>continues at an intolerably high level. The deep-rooted causes of pervasive domestic 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence demand a response that aims at effecting a change in attitudes and in values. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Investment in education, including the continuation of mandatory education in 
</b></p>
<p>women&#8217;s human rights in all schools<b>, is essential. Existing measures for monitoring 
</b></p>
<p><b>the media and advertising for their negative portrayal of women should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthened by enforcing sanctions and ensuring the equal participation of women in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the media. 
</b></p>
<p>102.<b> Women, and sometimes their children, continue to be killed by their current or 
</b></p>
<p>former partners, some despite the woman&#8217;s repeated requests for protection and <b>the 
</b></p>
<p><b>cancellation of visitation rights or custody. Current legislation only covers certain 
</b></p>
<p><b>forms of gender-based violence, such as intimate partner violence; it should therefore 
</b></p>
<p><b>be extended to all other forms of gender-based violence, including violence in schools, 
</b></p>
<p><b>in public spaces and against vulnerable groups of women. 
</b></p>
<p>103.<b> The State has a progressive law on sexual reproductive health and voluntary 
</b></p>
<p><b>termination of pregnancy for the first 14 weeks. It recognizes a woma</b>n&#8217;s right to the 
</p>
<p><b>highest standard of health and autonomy, </b>and views the protection of women&#8217;s sexual 
</p>
<p><b>and reproductive rights as a part of gender equality. This right is, however, dependent 
</b></p>
<p><b>on parental consent for girls under the age of 16. Furthermore, there are gaps in its 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation, because the law also allows for exemptions owing to conscientious 
</b></p>
<p><b>objection, and repeated attempts have been made to introduce retrogressive 
</b></p>
<p><b>modifications in the law. 
</b></p>
<p>104.<b> The State has achieved universal health coverage, but the recent exclusion of 
</b></p>
<p><b>migrants in an irregular situation represents a retrogressive measure incompatible </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/40/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p><b>with </b>the State&#8217;s <b>international and regional human rights obligations. It is important to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that this does not affect migrant women disparately and that they continue to 
</b></p>
<p><b>receive free-of-charge these medical services, which play a vital role in detecting 
</b></p>
<p><b>gender-based violence. 
</b></p>
<p>105.<b> The participation of women in the national parliament, at 37.5 per cent, is one 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the highest in the world. This is not, however, the case in other areas of political and 
</b></p>
<p><b>public life, particularly at the highest level of local, regional and national government, 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the judiciary or the diplomatic service. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>106.<b> In the area of institutional framework, the Working</b> <b>Group recommends that 
</b></p>
<p><b>the State: 
</b></p>
<p>(a)<b> Apply the norms of gender equality, the prohibition of discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b>against women and the elimination of gender-based violence in accordance with the its 
</b></p>
<p><b>obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b>against Women, relevant ILO conventions, the European Convention on Human 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violence uniformly to all autonomous communities, if necessary, this should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensured by amendments to the Constitution; 
</b></p>
<p>(b)<b> Restore the Institute of Women as the dedicated entity focusing on
