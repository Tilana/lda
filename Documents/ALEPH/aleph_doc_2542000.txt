Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1.  Management’s Representation of Interim Financial Information 
 
The  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  by  management  of  VTEX  Energy,  Inc. 
(formerly Vector Energy Corporation), a Nevada corporation and its subsidiaries, Vector Exploration, Inc. and Viking 
International  Petroleum,  PLC  (“Viking”),  collectively  the  “Company”  without  audit  pursuant  to  the  rules  and 
regulations  of  the  SEC.    Certain  information  and  footnote  disclosure  normally  included  in  the  financial  statements 
prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted as allowed 
by  such  rules  and  regulations,  and  management  believes  that  the  disclosures  are  adequate  to  make  the  information 
presented not misleading.  These financial statements include all of the adjustments that, in the opinion of management, 
are  necessary  for  the  fair  presentation  of  the  financial  position  and  results  of  operations  of  the  Company.    These 
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
April 30, 2005, which are included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-KSB filed with the SEC on August 15, 
2005. 
 
Business and Organization 
 
The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Texas on June 18, 1998 as Vector Energy Corporation.  
Effective November 15, 2002, the Company was reincorporated into Nevada.  The reincorporation was effected by the 
merger of Vector Energy Corporation with and into a newly created wholly owned subsidiary VTEX Energy, Inc., a 
Nevada  corporation,  which  became  the  surviving  entity.    The  Company  is  primarily  engaged  in  the  acquisition, 
development, production and exploration of oil and natural gas properties in the United States.  The Company also has, 
through its wholly owned subsidiary Viking, a 26% interest in an entity that owns a gas field in the United Kingdom. 
 
Going Concern 
 
For the year ended April 30, 2005 our independent registered public accounting firm issued a going concern opinion.  
As  shown  in  the  financial  statements,  the  Company  has  historically  incurred  net  losses  from  operations  and  has 
incurred net losses of approximately $3,170,000 and $1,723,000 for the six months ended October 31, 2005 and 2004, 
respectively, and losses are expected to be incurred in the near term.  Current liabilities exceeded current assets by 
approximately $6,194,000 and $4,114,000 at October 31, 2005 and April 30, 2005, respectively, and the accumulated 
deficit is approximately $27,726,000 at October 31, 2005.  Amounts outstanding and payable to creditors are in arrears 
and  the  Company  is  in  negotiations  with  creditors  to  obtain  extensions  and  settlements  of  outstanding  amounts.  
Management anticipates that significant additional expenditures will be necessary to develop the Company’s oil and 
natural gas properties, which consist primarily of proved reserves that are non-producing, before significant positive 
operating cash flows will be achieved.  Without outside investment from the sale of equity securities or debt financing 
our  ability  to  execute our business  plan will  be  limited.   These factors  are  an  indication  that  the  Company  may  be 
unable to continue in existence.  Furthermore, the Texas Railroad Commission declined a request by the Company for a 
reduction in bonding requirements which were recently increased by the State of Texas.  The Company has not secured 
a new bond which may impact operations at Mustang Island.  See Note 7. 
 
Management's plans to alleviate these conditions include the renegotiation of certain trade payables, settlements of debt 
amounts with stock, deferral of certain scheduled payments, and sales of non core properties, as considered necessary 
by  management.    In  addition,  management  is  pursuing  business  partnering  arrangements  for  the  acquisition  and 
development of additional properties as well as debt and equity funding through private placements. 
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared as if the Company will continue as a going concern.  
The  consolidated  financial  statements  do  not  contain  adjustments,  including  adjustments  to  recorded  assets  and 
liabilities, which might be necessary if the Company were unable to continue as a going concern. 
 
Note 2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 
Principles of Consolidation 
 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of VTEX Energy, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, 
Vector  Exploration,  Inc.  and  Viking  International  Petroleum,  PLC  (“Viking”)  (see  Note  4).    All  significant 
intercompany  accounts  and  transactions  have  been  eliminated  in  consolidation.    The  Company  applies  the  equity 
method of accounting when it is determined that it can exert significant influence, but not control, over the policies and 
decisions of the entity.
9
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassed to conform to the current period presentation.  These reclassifications 
did not effect the amount of the net loss, total assets or net equity. 
 
Oil and Natural Gas Properties 
 
The Company follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and natural gas properties.  All costs associated 
with property acquisition, exploration, and development activities are capitalized in a single cost center located within 
the United States.  Internal costs directly identified with the acquisition, exploration and development activities of the 
Company are also capitalized.  Capitalized costs are amortized on the unit-of-production basis using proved oil and 
natural gas reserves.  Capitalized costs are subject to a “ceiling test” and limited to the present value of estimated future 
net revenues less estimated future expenditures using a discount factor of ten percent.  Should capitalized costs exceed 
the  present  value of our reserves  discounted  at  ten percent,  the excess is  charged  to operations.   Once  incurred, an 
impairment of oil and natural gas properties can not be reversed at a later date.  Impairment of oil and natural gas 
properties is assessed on a quarterly basis in conjunction with our quarterly filings with the SEC.  Sales of proved and 
unproved oil and natural gas properties are treated as reductions of the capitalized cost pool, unless such adjustments 
would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves.  At October 31, 2005 and April 
30, 2005, there were no costs of unproved properties or major development projects included in the capitalized cost 
pool.  The depletion rates per Mcfe for the three and six months ended October 31, 2005 and 2004 were $1.61 and 
$1.61 and $1.00 and $1.04, respectively. 
 
The equity investment held by Viking is a 26% ownership in an entity that owns and operates various oil and natural 
gas properties.  The Company subjects this equity investment to the same impairment criteria used to evaluate its direct 
ownership interests in proved oil and natural gas properties.  No impairment was required as of October 31, 2005 for 
this equity investment. 
 
Asset Retirement Obligations 
 
The Company records a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets in the 
period in which they are incurred in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 143 
“Accounting  for  Asset  Retirement  Obligations."  The  Company  adopted  this  policy  effective  May  1,  2003,  using  a 
cumulative effect approach to recognize transition amounts for asset retirement obligations (“ARO”), asset retirement 
costs  and  accumulated  accretion  and  depletion.  Under  this  method,  when  liabilities  for  dismantlement  and 
abandonment costs, excluding salvage values, are initially recorded the carrying amount of the related oil and natural 
gas  properties  are  increased.    Accretion  of  the  liability  is  recognized  each  period  using  the  interest  method  of 
allocation, and the capitalized cost is depleted over the useful life of the related asset.  Revisions to such estimates are 
recorded as adjustments to the ARO, capitalized asset retirement costs and charges to operations during the periods in 
which they become known.  At the time the abandonment cost is incurred, the Company will be required to recognize a 
gain or loss if the actual costs do not equal the estimated costs included in ARO (see Note 6). 
 
Stock-Based Compensation 
 
The Company accounts for stock based compensation to employees under the fair value method prescribed by SFAS 
No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.”  Under the fair value method, compensation cost is measured at 
the grant date of each common stock option or warrant  based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the 
vesting period, which is usually the service period.  For common stock options and warrants, fair value is determined 
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that takes into account the common stock market price at the grant date, 
the exercise price, the expected life of the common stock option or warrant, the market volatility of the underlying 
common stock, the dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the common stock option or 
warrant.  The fair value of a common stock option or warrant is estimated at the grant date and is not subsequently 
adjusted for changes in the assumptions used. 
 
Loss Per Share 
 
Loss per share has been calculated using the weighted average number of shares outstanding.  Outstanding warrants 
and other potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the calculation of loss per share, as their effect would 
be anti-dilutive due to the Company incurring a net loss for all periods presented.  At October 31, 2005 and 2004, there 
were  516,446  and  1,043,249  shares,  respectively,  that  the  Company  was  obligated  to  issue.    The  weighted  average 
effects of these shares was 370,826 and 746,766 for the three months ended October 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively,

2004, there were 250,000 warrants that were potentially dilutive common shares.  
 
Statement of Cash Flows 
 
For  purposes  of  the  consolidated  statement  of  cash  flows,  the  Company  considers  all  highly  liquid  investments 
purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.   
 
The following is a summary of all payments made for interest and significant noncash financing activities for the six 
months ended October 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 
 
Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information:
Guarantees  
 
Guarantees are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) 
Interpretation  No.  (“FIN”)  45,“Guarantor's  Accounting  and  Disclosure  Requirements  for  Guarantees,  Including 
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.” FIN 45 establishes disclosure and liability-recognition requirements 
for direct and indirect debt guarantees with specified characteristics. 
 
Note 3.  Certificates of Deposit 
 
At  October  31,  2005  and  April  30,  2005,  the  Company  had  certificates  of  deposit  totaling  $101,807  and  $98,917, 
respectively.  Such certificates bear interest at rates ranging from 2.52% to 2.81% at October 31, 2005.  The maturity 
dates of the certificates ranged from March 20, 2006 to June 3, 2006.  The certificates of deposit are collateral for 
letters  of  credit,  with  expiration  dates  corresponding  to  the  maturity  dates  of  the  certificates,  issued  in  favor  of 
governmental agencies in states in which the Company operates wells.  It is anticipated that such certificates of deposit 
and the corresponding letters of credit will be renewed at maturity. 
 
Note 4.  Acquisitions and Dispositions of Oil and Natural Gas Properties 
 
On  January  13,  2005,  the  Company  executed  a  purchase  and  sale  agreement  with  ARCOA  Oil  &  Gas,  Inc. 
(“ARCOA”),  which  was  subsequently  amended  in  March  2005.    Under  the  terms  of  the  agreement,  as  amended, 
ARCOA acquired a net profits interest in three wells on the Company’s Bateman Lake property for up to $1,150,000.  
The  net  profits  interest  is  initially  payable  out  of  75%  of  the  monthly  cash  flows,  as  defined,  attributable  to  the 
Company’s interest in such wells until payout, including a 12% rate of return.  The net profits interest will then be 
reduced to 65% until the well has produced a total of $7 million of net cash flow to the Company’s working interest.  
The net profits interest will be further reduced to 60% when the net cash flows attributable to the Company’s working 
interest reaches a total of $9 million.  At that time, the net profits interest will be reduced to 30% which will be the net 
profits percentage there after.  To the extent that ARCOA elects to acquire a net profits interest of less than $1,150,000 
the  net  profits  amounts  will  be  proportionately  reduced.    Further  more,  after  June  1,  2006,  ARCOA  may  elect  to 
convert its net profits interest into common stock of the Company at a conversion rate of $1.25 per share.  The value of
11
the net profits interest will be determined based upon the net cash flows attributable to the reserves, discounted at 15%.  
ARCOA has until December, 31, 2005 to fund and close the transaction.  However, such date may be extended by 
mutual agreement.  The Company has received a total of $645,000 in payments from ARCOA from inception of this 
agreement through October 31, 2005, of which $445,000 was received during the six months ended October 31, 2005, 
representing its purchase of net profits interests in certain oil and natural gas wells. 
 
On July 29, 2005, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Viking. Viking is a UK 
registered company with offices in London and owns a 26% interest in a company that owns the North Yorkshire gas 
fields  (an  extension  of  the  Southern  North  Sea  Gas  Basin  onshore).  The  properties  include  licenses  covering 
approximately  100,000  acres  onshore  including,  four  proved  producing  fields,  two  proved  undeveloped  fields  and 
additional seismically mapped low risk exploration potential. Upon closing of this acquisition, the Company delivered 
400,000  shares  of  its  common  stock,  valued  at  $128,000,  to  Viking  for  distribution  to  its  shareholders,  with  an 
obligation to deliver an additional 1.6 million shares of its common stock no later than six months from the acquisition, 
or earlier if certain defined goals are met, unless there is a foreclosure on the assets of Viking's interest in the gas fields.  
Such additional shares, valued at $512,000 were issued on October 18, 2005.  Viking’s interest in the gas fields is 
security for debt in Viking Petroleum UK, Limited.  Such debt is not currently in default, however the Company has no 
assurance that an event of default will not occur.  Additionally, prior to the closing of the acquisition, the Company 
advanced $127,757 to Viking for working capital purposes.  This amount is considered a component of the purchase 
price paid to acquire the stock of Viking.  This transaction has been recorded using the purchase method of accounting 
and the results of operations subsequent to July 29, 2005 are recorded in the consolidated results of operations of the 
Company.

On  October  7,  2005,  the  Company  entered  into  an  agreement  with  Marathon  Capital,  LLC  (“Marathon”)  and  U.S. 
Energy  Systems,  Inc. (“USEY”)  to  jointly  acquire  the assets  owned by  Viking Petroleum  UK  Limited,  an  entity  in 
which the Company owns a 26% interest through its wholly owned subsidiary Viking.  The acquisition will be made 
through a newly created entity which will be owned 25% by each of Marathon and the Company in consideration of 
their contribution of assets and/or services, and 50% will be owned by an entity USEY will organize in consideration of 
a  capital  contribution  of  up  to  $5  million.    It  is  anticipated  that  the  aggregate  purchase  price  for  the  assets  will  be 
approximately  $60  million,  of  which  $5  million  will  consist  of  the  contributed  capital.    Additional  funding  of  the 
acquisition is expected to consist of project financing secured by the acquired assets.

Lines of Credit 
 
The  Company  has  a  $10.0  million  revolving  credit  line  with  an  entity  controlled  by  the  brother  of  the  Company’s 
president.  The borrowing base under this revolving credit line is $3,624,707 at October 31, 2005, which is equal to the 
outstanding balance at that time and cannot be increased without the consent of the lender.  The line of credit is secured 
by all of the Company’s oil and natural gas properties and bears interest at the rate of 7.5%.  Accrued interest on the 
line of credit totaled $137,044 at October 31, 2005.  Under its terms, the line of credit accrues interest through October 
31, 2005, at which time interest will be due monthly.  Beginning in November 2006, the principal balance outstanding 
under the line of credit converts to a term note and is payable in 48 equal monthly installments along with current 
interest. 
 
On April 8, 2004, the Company entered into a $250,000 revolving credit agreement with Hibernia Bank.  The note has 
been guaranteed by a private investor who received 100,000 shares of the Company’s common stock with a fair value 
of $49,000 as consideration for such guarantee.  The fair value of the common stock was expensed when incurred.  
Interest on this note is payable monthly at a floating rate of prime plus 1.097% (7.847% and 6.847% at October 31, 
2005 and April 30, 2005, respectively.)  The outstanding balance under the note, which was $245,304 and $246,537 at 
October 31, 2005 and April 30, 2005, respectively, is due upon demand. 
 
On June 21, 2005, the Company entered into a $500,000 revolving credit agreement with Bank of Texas.  The note was 
guaranteed  by  a  private  investor  who  received  200,000  shares  of  the  Company’s  common  stock  and  warrants  to 
purchase 100,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at $0.50.  The value of the common stock and warrants, 
which is $88,490, has been included in deferred loan costs and is being amortized over the life of the loan.  Interest on 
this  note  is payable  quarterly  at  the  prime  rate, which was  6.75%  at October 31, 2005.   The  note has  a  balance of 
$475,000 at October 31, 2005 and matures on June 20, 2006. 
 
Other Notes Payable 
 
Included in other notes payable are unsecured 9% to 10% notes issued to vendors in settlement of accounts payable.  
Certain of the notes are past their due dates and are due on demand.  These notes totaled $42,842 at October 31, 2005 
and April 30, 2005. 
 
In  March,  2004,  the  Company  issued  a  $150,000  note  payable  to  Mustang  Island  Gathering,  LLC  (the  “LLC”)  for 
indemnification of litigation settlement costs.  Mustang Island Gathering, LLC purchases the natural gas produced from 
the Company’s Mustang Island property, and the Company is an approximate 10% owner in the LLC.  The note is 
payable  in  monthly  installments,  with  interest  at  4.5%,  at  the  rate  of  $0.03  per  MCF  of  natural  gas  purchased, 
beginning with April 2004 production  The balance due under the note was $75,049 and $96,220 at October 31, 2005 
and April 30, 2005, respectively. 
 
Also included in other notes payable is a financing obligation for insurance premiums, payable in monthly installments, 
with interest at 7.48%, through February 2006.  Such obligation had a balance of $66,809 at October 31, 2005. 
 
During December 2003 and January 2004, the Company issued a series of 12% notes totaling $40,000 to investors for 
working capital loans.  The Company also issued the investors 40,000 shares of its common stock.  The stock issued 
was  recorded  at  its  fair  market  value  of  $27,600  and  treated  as  deferred  loan  cost  which  was  amortized  over  four 
months.  The notes were due on dates ranging from April 29, 2004 to May 26, 2004 and were in default.  These notes 
were subject to a demand for payment at any time.  However, the Company subsequently reached agreement with the 
investors to extend the due dates of the notes to dates ranging from April 29, 2005 to May 26, 2005 in return for the
13
issuance of 28,250 shares of its common stock and warrants to purchase 5,000 shares of the Company’s common stock 
at $0.50 per share which expire on January 26, 2006.  The stock and warrants issued were recorded at their fair market 
value of $17,048 and treated as deferred loan cost which is being amortized over one year.  During June 2005, the 
Company reached agreements with the holders of notes totaling $30,000 to further extend the maturity dates of the 
notes to December 31, 2005 in return for the issuance of 18,000 shares of the Company’s common stock.  The stock 
was recorded at its fair market value of $5,220 and treated as deferred loan cost which is being amortized over the 
terms of the extensions.  At October 31, 2005, the 18,000 shares of common stock remained unissued, however their 
fair value has been included in stockholders’ equity.  In July 2005, the Company paid the remaining $10,000 principal 
balance  and  $1,792  in  accrued  interest  on  the  only  note  which  was  not  extended.    Accrued  interest  on  these  notes 
totaled $6,549 and $6,276 at October 31, 2005 and April 30, 2005, respectively.   
 
During March 2005, the Company issued a $250,000 unsecured note payable to a private investor.  The note bears 
interest at 12% and the principal and accrued interest is due in one payment upon the demand of the holder.  The note 
provided for the issuance to the investor of 50,000 shares of the Company’s common stock and warrants to purchase 
40,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at $0.50 per share which expire on March 10, 2007.  The common

Production Payments Payable 
 
During  October  and  November  of  2000,  the  Company  issued  31,687  shares  of  its  common  stock  and  undivided 
working  interests,  ranging  from  3.7%  to  4.4%,  in  three  nonproducing  wells  in  the  Mustang  Island  Field  to  private 
investors for total cash consideration of $254,000.  The proceeds were used to fund development of the wells.  The 
investors are entitled to recoup their investment out of 100% of the future production, if any, from the wells.  These 
transactions were treated, by the Company, as loans repayable out of production from designated wells for accounting 
purposes.  The stock issued was recorded at its fair market value as a loan cost which has been fully amortized.  The 
production loans began accruing interest on January 1, 2001 at 5.25% and accrued interest on the loans totaled $2,147 
and  $1,992  at  October  31,  2005  and  April  30,  2005,  respectively.    Although  certain  of  the  wells  covered  by  the 
production loans have been producing, the Company has not made any principal payments under the loans.  In January 
and  February  of  2004,  the  Company  issued  the  holders  of  the  production  loans  100,000  shares  of  the  Company’s 
common stock in return for their forbearance under the production loans until the earlier of the first month following 
the month in which the Company has positive cash flow or August 1, 2004.  The stock issued was recorded at its fair 
market value of $57,500 and treated as deferred loan cost which was amortized over six months.  In December of 2004, 
the  Company  reached  an  agreement  with  the  holders  of  the  loans  to  increase  the  interest  rate  to  6%,  begin  paying 
interest  monthly  on  the  loans  and  to  convert  the  accrued  interest  of  $51,503  into  principal.    In  August  2005,  the 
Company  agreed  to  issue  the  holders  of  the  production  loans  120,602  shares  of  its  common  stock  and  warrants  to 
purchase 60,300 shares of the Company’s common stock at $0.50 per share which expire on August 15, 2007 in return 
for their forbearance under the loans until December 31, 2005.  The common stock and warrants were recorded at their 
fair value of $64,112 and treated as deferred loan costs which are being amortized over the terms of the forbearance. 
 
In December 2000, the Company issued an undivided 10% interest in six wells located in the Mustang Island Field to 
Old Jersey Oil Ventures, LLC for cash consideration of $1,000,000.  The brother of the president of the Company is a 
principal in Old Jersey Oil Ventures, LLC.  Old Jersey Oil Ventures, LLC is entitled to recoup its investment out of 
future production from the wells in the Mustang Island Field. The transaction was treated, by the Company, as a loan 
repayable  out  of  production  from  designated  wells  for  accounting  purposes.    The  production  loan  began  accruing 
interest on January 1, 2001 at 5.25%.  In March, 2004, the Company issued Old Jersey Oil Ventures, LLC 400,000 
shares of the Company’s common stock in return for forbearance under the production payment until the earlier of the 
first month following the month in which the Company has positive cash flow or August 1, 2004.  The stock issued 
was recorded at its fair market value of $176,000 and treated as a deferred loan cost which was amortized over five 
months.    On  April  30,  2005,  the  production  payment  and  $240,438  in  accrued  interest  was  transferred  into  the 
Company’s line of credit with Old Jersey Oil Ventures, LLC. 
 
Note 6.  Asset Retirement Obligations 
 
Beginning in fiscal 2004, SFAS No. 143 requires the Company to recognize an estimated liability for the plugging and 
abandonment  of  its  oil  and  natural  gas  wells  and  associated  pipelines,  platforms,  and  equipment.    This  statement 
requires the Company to record a liability in the period in which its asset retirement obligation ("ARO") is incurred.  
Upon initial recognition of the liability, the Company must capitalize a corresponding asset cost equal to the amount of 
the  liability.    Upon  adoption  of  SFAS  No.  143  the  Company  recognized  (1)  a  liability  for  any  existing  ARO's,  (2) 
corresponding capitalized cost related to the liability, (3) accumulated depletion, depreciation and amortization on that 
capitalized cost, and (4) a cumulative effect of accounting change. 
 
The estimated liability is based on historical experience in plugging and abandoning wells and associated pipelines, 
platforms, and equipment, estimated remaining lives of those wells based on reserve estimates and federal and state 
regulatory requirements.  The liability is discounted using an assumed credit-adjusted risk-free rate of 7.5%.  Revisions 
to the liability could occur due to changes in estimates of plugging and abandonment costs, changes in the risk-free rate 
or remaining lives of the wells, or if federal or state regulators enact new plugging and abandonment requirements.  At 
the time the abandonment cost is incurred, the Company will be required to recognize a gain or loss if the actual costs 
do not equal the estimated costs included in the ARO. 
 
The adoption of SFAS No. 143 was effective beginning May 1, 2003 and resulted in an adjustment to record (1) an 
$1,084,028  ARO,  (2)  a  $850,194  increase  in  the  carrying  value  of  proved  properties,  (3)  a  $41,699  increase  in 
accumulated depletion, and (4) a $275,533 one-time cumulative effect of change in accounting principle.

Note 7.  Commitments and Contingencies 
 
The Texas Railroad Commission declined a request by the Company for a reduction in bonding requirements which 
were recently increased by the State of Texas for operators of certain wells located in offshore and bay State of Texas 
waters. The Company is working on obtaining a bond at this increased level but does not have such bond in place at 
this time. The Company has requested reconsideration by the Texas Railroad Commission of this decision and such 
request has been granted. Until a final decision in this matter, the Company will be allowed to continue its operations 
under its current bond. Should the Company not be successful in reducing the bond level, or in the alternative obtaining 
a bond at the increased level, or provide other satisfactory security the Company could outsource offshore operations of 
the property. 
 
In  June  2001,  the  Company  entered  into  a  long-term  lease  for  office  space  with  an  annual  rent  of  $65,124.    Rent 
expense for the six months ended October 31, 2005 and 2004 was $32,562.  As of October 31, 2005, future minimum 
lease payments under this lease were as follows:

As  a  member  of  Mustang  Island  Gathering,  LLC,  a  Texas  limited  liability  company  and  pipeline  operator,  the 
Company has been required to guarantee a portion of the LLC’s bank debt, which is approximately $1.1 million in the 
aggregate.  The Company’s share of such guarantee is approximately $40,000.  Due to positive financial performance 
of the pipeline, the likelihood that the Company will be required to perform under this guarantee is remote thus no 
amount is recorded to reflect the obligation under this guarantee. 
 
Subsequent to June 1, 2006, ARCOA shall have the right to convert its net profits interest into common stock of the 
Company at a conversion rate of $1.25 per share.  The value of the net profits interest will be determined based upon 
the net cash flows attributable to the reserves, discounted at 15%. 
 
From time to time, the Company is party to certain legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business.  
While the outcome of these events cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not expect these matters to 
have a materially adverse effect on the financial position of the Company. 
 
The operations and financial position of the Company continue to be affected from time to time in varying degrees by 
domestic and political developments as well as legislation and regulations pertaining to restrictions on oil and natural 
gas  production,  natural  gas  regulation,  tax  increases,  environmental  regulations  and  cancellation  of  contract  rights. 
Both the likelihood and overall effect of such occurrences on the Company vary greatly and are not predictable.

General Overview
VTEX Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), is an independent oil and natural gas company 
engaged in acquiring, exploiting, developing and operating oil and natural gas properties, with a focus on Texas and
18
Louisiana.    The  Company  has  two  wholly  owned  subsidiaries,  Vector  Exploration,  Inc.  and  Viking  Petroleum 
International, PLC, and is headquartered in Houston, Texas.
The  Company  was  incorporated  under  the  laws  of  the  State  of  Texas  on  June  18,  1998  as  Vector  Energy 
Corporation (“Vector”) which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Sunburst Acquisitions II, Inc. (“Sunburst”).  Vector 
was formed for the purpose of completing a reverse merger with Sunburst in order to change Sunburst's name to Vector 
Energy Corporation and its state of incorporation from Colorado to Texas.  This merger was completed on June 19, 
1998.  Effective November 15, 2002, the Company was reincorporated in Nevada.  The reincorporation was effected 
by  the  merger  of  Vector  with  and  into  a  newly  created,  wholly  owned  subsidiary,  VTEX  Energy,  Inc.,  a  Nevada 
Corporation, which became the surviving entity.
From its inception through March 2000, the Company consummated a series of oil and natural gas property 
acquisitions in Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma.  These acquisitions were funded primarily through the issuance of the 
Company’s  stock  and  the  Company’s  assumption  of  debt  and  other  liabilities.    The  properties  acquired  were  a 
combination of producing properties and properties considered to have future development potential.
A lack of working capital and the service requirements of the debt assumed by the Company in its acquisitions 
prevented the Company from fully developing the properties it had acquired.  Accordingly, the Company identified 
those properties that had the most potential for future development, and beginning in July 2002 began selling its non 
core non strategic oil and natural gas properties.  The proceeds from the property sales allowed the Company to reduce 
and restructure its debt, while retaining enough capital to begin development of the properties retained.
The estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves of the Company at April 30, 2005 were 103,000 barrels of 
crude oil and condensate and 9,424,000 Mcf (thousand cubic feet) of natural gas.  These reserves have an estimated 
$30 million in future net cash flow, discounted at 10%.  Of these reserves, an estimated 50,000 barrels of crude oil and 
condensate and 4,130,000 MCF of natural gas with an estimated $13 million in future net cash flow, discounted at 
10%, are considered to be proved developed.  The Company’s reserves are located in two fields, Bateman Lake and 
Mustang Island 818-L.

Oil  and  natural  gas  revenues  for  the  three  months  ended  October  31,  2005  decreased  31%  to  $213,516, 
compared to $309,379 for the same period in fiscal 2005.  Production volumes for natural gas during the three months 
ended October 31, 2005 decreased 53%, to 25,487 Mcf, compared to 54,479 Mcf for the three months ended October 
31, 2004.  Average natural gas prices for the three months ended October 31, 2005 increased 43% to $8.15 per Mcf, 
compared to $5.68 per Mcf for the same period in fiscal 2005.  Production volumes for oil for the three months ended 
October 31, 2005 increased to 92 barrels compared to none produced during the three months ended October 31, 2004.  
Average oil prices for the three months ended October 31, 2005 were $62.79 per barrel.  The decrease in oil and natural 
gas production was primarily due to the wells at the Bateman Lake Field being shut-in pending completion of certain 
repairs.

The  following  table  summarizes  production  volumes,  average  sales  prices  and  operating  revenues  for  the
Company's oil and natural gas operations for the three months ended October 31, 2005 and 2004.
Production expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2005 increased 37% to $208,160 compared to 
$152,308 for the same period in fiscal 2005.  Production expense per equivalent unit increased to $7.99 per Mcfe for 
the  three  months  ended  October  31,  2005  compared  to  $2.80  in  the  same  period  in  fiscal  2005.    This  increase  in 
production expense per Mcfe is caused by the effect of fixed lease operating expenses combined with a decrease in 
production volumes.
Depreciation and depletion expense decreased from $54,722 for the three months ended October 31, 2004 to 
$46,263 for the three months ended October 31, 2005. This 15% decrease was primarily due to a 52% decrease in Mcfe 
production  volumes  partially  offset  by  a  negative  revision  in  reserve  volume  estimates  since  April  30,  2004  which 
increased the depletion rate on an Mcfe basis.
General and administrative expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2005 decreased by $410,982 to 
$722,819 compared to $1,133,801 for the three months ended October 31, 2004.  The decrease was primarily due to the 
fair value of stock options issued to executive officers and directors of $1,280,000 which was expensed in the first 
quarter  of  fiscal  2006.  This  decrease  in  general  and  administrative  expense  was  partially  offset  by  the  general  and 
administrative expenses of Viking, which were included in the Company’s operations beginning July 29, 2005.
Accretion expense for the three months ended October 31, 2005 increased by $1,279 to $23,539 compared to 
$22,260 for the three months ended October 31, 2004.  This increase was due to the normal compound effect of the 
discount factor attributable to the Company’s asset retirement obligation.
Interest expense for the three months ended October 31, 2005 increased by 69% to $350,641 from $207,070 
for  the  same  period  in  fiscal  2005.    The  increase  in  interest  expense  was  due  primarily  to  an  increase  in  weighted 
average debt from $3,996,278 for the three months ended October 31, 2004 to $6,791,088 for the three months ended 
October 31, 2005.  Amortization of loan discount and deferred loan costs included in interest expense increased from 
$135,729 for the three months ended October 31, 2004 to $200,501 for the three months ended October 31, 2005.  
 
Six Months Ended October 31, 2005 Compared to Six Months Ended October 31, 2004
Oil  and  natural  gas  revenues  for  the  six  months  ended  October  31,  2005  decreased  45%  to  $413,230, 
compared to $751,186 for the same period in fiscal 2005.  Production volumes for natural gas during the six months 
ended October 31, 2005 decreased 48%, to 59,661 Mcf, compared to 115,461 Mcf for the six months ended October 
31, 2004.  Average natural gas prices for the six months ended October 31, 2005 increased 14% to $6.83 per Mcf, 
compared to $6.01 per Mcf for the same period in fiscal 2005.  Production volumes for oil for the six months ended 
October 31, 2005 decreased to 92 barrels compared to 1,628 produced during the six months ended October 31, 2004.  
Average oil prices for the six months ended October 31, 2005 increased 78% to $62.79 per barrel compared to $35.21 
per barrel for the same period in fiscal 2005.  The decrease in oil and natural gas production was primarily due to the 
wells at the Bateman Lake Field being shut-in pending completion of certain repairs.

The  following  table  summarizes  production  volumes,  average  sales  prices  and  operating  revenues  for  the
Company's oil and natural gas operations for the six months ended October 31, 2005 and 2004.
Production  expenses  for  the  six  months  ended  October  31,  2005  increased  3%  to  $347,473  compared  to 
$337,602 for the same period in fiscal 2005.  Production expense per equivalent unit increased to $5.77 per Mcfe for 
the  six  months  ended  October  31,  2005  compared  to  $2.70  in  the  same  period  in  fiscal  2005.    This  increase  in 
production expense per Mcfe is caused by the effect of fixed lease operating expenses combined with a decrease in 
production volumes.
Depreciation and depletion expense decreased from $130,515 for the six months ended October 31, 2004 to 
$104,945 for the six months ended October 31, 2005. This 20% decrease was primarily due to a 52% decrease in Mcfe 
production  volumes  partially  offset  by  a  negative  revision  in  reserve  volume  estimates  since  April  30,  2004  which 
increased the depletion rate on an Mcfe basis.
General  and  administrative  expenses for  the  six  months ended October  31, 2005  increased by  $950,411  to 
$2,507,329 compared to $1,556,918 for the six months ended October 31, 2004.  The increase was primarily due to the 
fair value of stock options issued to executive officers and directors of $1,280,000 which was expensed in the first 
quarter of fiscal 2006.
Accretion expense for the six months ended October 31, 2005 increased by $2,534 to $46,644 compared to 
$44,110  for  the  six  months ended October  31, 2004.   This  increase was  due  to  the normal  compound  effect of  the 
discount factor attributable to the Company’s asset retirement obligation.
Interest expense for the six months ended October 31, 2005 increased by 42% to $585,720 from $412,754 for 
the same period in fiscal 2005.  The increase in interest expense was due primarily to an increase in weighted average 
debt from $3,761,926 for the six months ended October 31, 2004 to $6,325,289 for the six months ended October 31, 
2005.  Amortization of loan discount and deferred loan costs included in interest expense decreased from $321,735 for 
the six months ended October 31, 2004 to $308,616 for the six months ended October 31, 2005.  
 
Financial Condition and Capital Resources
Since its inception, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has been dependent on 
existing stockholders and new investors to provide the cash resources to sustain its operations.  During the six months 
ended  October  31,  2005  and  2004,  the  Company  reported  losses  of  approximately  $3,170,000  and  $1,723,000, 
respectively.    The  Company’s  continuing  negative  operating  results  have  produced  a  working  capital  deficit  of 
approximately $6,194,000 at October 31, 2005.  These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.  The Company’s long-term viability as a going concern is dependent upon the Company’s 
ability  to  obtain  sources  of  outside  financing  to  support  near  term  operations  and  to  allow  the  Company  to  make 
strategic  investments  in  new  oil  and  natural  gas  prospects  which  will  provide  the  Company  the  ability  to  increase 
revenue and profitability and sustain a cash flow level that will ensure support for continuing operations.
For the past three months, the Company's oil and natural gas revenues have been sufficient to satisfy its oil 
and natural gas operating expenses and a portion of its general and administrative expenses.  The Company has funded
21
the  remainder  of  its  general  and  administrative  expenses  and  the  development  of  its  oil  and  natural  gas  properties 
through additional borrowings under its lines of credit, through short term investor notes, proceeds from the sale of its 
oil and gas properties and issuance of its common stock.  Additional equity funding will be required in the near term to 
meet the capital needs of the Company.  The Company is evaluating various financing alternatives such as the issuance 
of  debt,  private  placements  of  its  common  and  preferred  stock,  sales  of  interests  in  some  of  its  oil  and natural  gas 
properties  and  joint ventures  with  industry  partners.   There  is no  guarantee  that  the Company  will  be  successful  in 
obtaining such financing, or that the terms of any financing obtained will be on terms favorable to the Company.  Any 
inability  of  the  Company  to  raise  additional  capital  will  limit  the  development  of  most  of  its  oil  and  natural  gas 
properties and may prevent the Company from meeting its cash requirements.  If the wells which are currently being 
brought  into  production  through  development  and  workovers  perform  as  expected    additional  cash  flows  may  be 
available; however, there is no assurance that such cash flows will in fact be available or that the wells will, in fact, 
perform as expected.  In the absence of such well performance or financing, the Company will not be able to meet its 
financial obligations.
The Texas Railroad Commission declined a request by the Company for a reduction in bonding requirements 
which were recently increased by the State of Texas for operators of certain wells located in offshore and bay State of 
Texas waters. The Company is working on obtaining a bond at this increased level but does not have such bond in 
place at this time. The Company has requested reconsideration by the Texas Railroad Commission of this decision and 
such  request  has  been  granted.  Until  a  final  decision  in  this  matter,  the  Company  will  be  allowed  to  continue  its 
operations  under  its  current  bond.  Should  the  Company  not  be  successful  in  reducing  the  bond  level,  or  in  the 
alternative obtaining a bond at the increased level, or provide other satisfactory security the Company could outsource 
offshore operations of the property.
The Company is currently negotiating with many of the vendors for which accounts payable were assumed in 
prior asset acquisition transactions, and believes that a significant portion of these payables can be satisfied through the 
issuance of common stock.  
 
Financing Arrangements
The  Company  has  a  $10.0  million  revolving  credit  line  with  an  entity  controlled  by  the  brother  of  the 
Company’s president.  The borrowing base under this revolving credit line is $3,624,707 at October 31, 2005, which is 
equal to the outstanding balance at that time and cannot be increased without the consent of the lender.  The line of 
credit is secured by all of the Company’s oil and natural gas properties and bears interest at the rate of 7.5%.  Accrued 
interest on the line of credit totaled $137,044 at October 31, 2005.  Under its terms, the line of credit accrues interest 
through October 31, 2005, at which time interest will be due monthly.  Beginning in November 2006, the principal 
balance outstanding under the line of credit converts to a term note and is payable in 48 equal monthly installments 
along with current interest.
On April 8, 2004, the Company entered into a $250,000 revolving credit agreement with Hibernia Bank.  The 
note has been guaranteed by a private investor who received 100,000 shares of the Company’s common stock with a 
fair value of $49,000 as consideration for such guarantee.  The fair value of the common stock was expensed when 
incurred.    Interest  on  this  note  is  payable  monthly  at  a  floating  rate  of  prime  plus  1.097%  (7.847%  and  6.847%  at 
October 31, 2005 and April 30, 2005, respectively.)  The outstanding balance under the note, which was $245,304 and 
$246,537 at October 31, 2005 and April 30, 2005, respectively, is due upon demand.
On June 21, 2005, the Company entered into a $500,000 revolving credit agreement with Bank of Texas.  The 
note was guaranteed by a private investor who received 200,000 shares of the Company’s common stock and warrants 
to purchase 100,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at $0.50.  The value of the common stock and warrants, 
which is $88,490, has been included in deferred loan costs and is being amortized over the life of the loan.  Interest on 
this  note  is payable  quarterly  at  the  prime  rate, which was  6.75%  at October 31, 2005.   The  note has  a  balance of 
$475,000 at October 31, 2005 and matures on June 20, 2006.
The  Company  has  outstanding  production  payments  in  the  amount  of  $305,504  at  October  31,  2005.  In 
August 2005, the Company agreed to issue the holders of the production loans 120,602 shares of its common stock and 
warrants to purchase 60,300 shares of the Company’s common stock at $0.50 per share which expire on August 15, 
2007 in return for their forbearance under the loans until December 31, 2005.  The common stock and warrants were 
recorded at their fair value of $64,112 and treated as deferred loan costs which are being amortized over the terms of 
the  forbearance.    If  such  forbearance  is  not  continued,  the  Company  will  be  required  to  remit  the  revenue  from  a 
substantial portion of the Company’s production.
22
From  time  to  time  the  Company  incurs  notes  payable  to  settle  outstanding  accounts  payable  and  other 
liabilities, finance expenditures and generate working capital.  The balances of such notes payable were $2,409,117 and 
$1,377,333 at October 31, 2005 and April 30, 2005, respectively.
As a member of Mustang Island Gathering, LLC ( the “LLC”), a Texas limited liability company and pipeline 
operator, the Company has been required to guarantee a portion of the LLC’s bank debt, which is approximately $1.1 
million  in  the  aggregate.    The  Company’s  share  of  such  guarantee  is  approximately  $40,000.    Due  to  the  financial 
performance of the pipeline, the likelihood that the Company will be required to perform under this guarantee is remote 
thus no amount is recorded to reflect the obligation under this guarantee. 
 
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Cash  flows  used  in  operating  activities  were  $1,451,283  for  the  six  months  ended  October  31,  2005  as 
compared to $263,461 provided by operating activities for the six months ended October 31, 2004.  This decrease was 
primarily due to the Company beginning to utilize some of the working capital raised by debt offerings to pay past 
operating costs which had been deferred, combined with a decrease in oil and natural gas revenues and an increase in 
professional fees incurred.  
 
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
Cash flows used in investing activities was $14,611 for the six months ended October 31, 2005 as compared to 
$1,017,665 for the six months ended October 31, 2004.  This increase was due primarily to a decrease of $645,686 in 
oil and natural gas capital expenditures incurred related to workovers and a recompletion performed on three wells in 
the Bateman Lake field during fiscal 2005.  In addition, the Company had proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas 
properties of $445,000 during the six months ended October 31, 2005. 
 
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities
Net cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $1,471,904 for the six months ended October 31, 2005 
primarily from borrowings under a new line of credit from a bank and notes payable to investors combined totaling 
$1,599,595 offset by debt repayments totaling $115,191.  Net cash provided from financing activities totaled $673,972 
for the six months ended October 31, 2004 primarily from borrowings under a new line of credit from a bank and notes 
payable to investors totaling $849,300 offset by the net repayments of debt totaling $114,197. 
  
Critical Accounting Policies
The following summarizes several of our critical accounting policies:
Use of Estimates
The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles 
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and 
disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  financial  statements  and  the  reported  amounts  of 
revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  Actual results could differ from these estimates.  The use of these 
estimates significantly affects natural gas and oil properties through depletion and the full cost ceiling test, as discussed 
in more detail below. 
 
Oil and Natural Gas Properties
We account for investments in natural gas and oil properties using the full-cost method of accounting.  All 
costs  directly  associated  with  the  acquisition,  exploration  and  development  of  natural  gas  and  oil  properties  are 
capitalized.  These  costs  include  lease  acquisitions,  seismic  surveys,  and  drilling  and  completion  equipment.    We 
expense maintenance and repairs as they are incurred.
We amortize natural gas and oil properties based on the unit-of-production method using estimates of proved 
reserve  quantities.    The  amortizable  base  includes  estimated  future  development  costs  and,  where  significant, 
dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of estimated salvage values.  The depletion rates per Mcfe for 
the three and six months ended October 31, 2005 and 2004 were $1.61 and $1.61 and $1.00 and $1.04, respectively.
23
We account for dispositions of natural gas and oil properties as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain 
or  loss  recognized,  unless  such  adjustments  would  significantly  alter  the  relationship  between  capitalized  costs  and 
proved reserves.  We have not had any transactions that significantly alter that relationship.
The net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a "ceiling test" which limits 
such  costs  to  the  estimated  present  value,  discounted  at  a  10%  interest  rate,  of  future  net  revenues  from  proved 
reserves, based on current economic and operating conditions. If net capitalized costs exceed this limit, the excess is 
charged to operations through depletion, depreciation and amortization.
Oil and Natural Gas Reserve Estimates
The  reserve  data  included  in  this  document  for  the  fiscal  year  ended  April  30,  2005  and  thereafter  are 
estimates prepared by D. Raymond Perry, Jr., Independent Petroleum Engineer.  Reserve engineering is a subjective 
process of estimating underground accumulations of hydrocarbons that cannot be measured in an exact manner.  The 
process relies on interpretation of available geologic, geophysical, engineering and production data. The extent, quality 
and reliability of this data can vary.  The process also requires certain economic assumptions regarding drilling and 
operating expense, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds.  The SEC mandates some of these assumptions 
such as oil and natural gas prices and the present value discount rate.
You  should  not  assume  that  the  present  value  of  future  net  cash  flows  is  the  current  market  value  of  our 
estimated proved reserves.  In accordance with SEC requirements, we based the estimated discounted future net cash 
flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate.
Our rate of recording depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for proved properties depends on our 
estimate  of  proved  reserves.    If  these  reserve  estimates  decline,  the  rate  at  which  we  record  these  expenses  will 
increase.
Asset Retirement Obligations
The  Company  records  a  liability  for  legal  obligations  associated  with  the  retirement  of  tangible  long-lived 
assets in the period in which they are incurred in accordance with SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement 
Obligations."    The  Company  adopted  this  policy  effective  May  1,  2003,  using  a  cumulative  effect  approach  to 
recognize  transition  amounts  for  asset  retirement  obligations,  asset  retirement  costs  and  accumulated  accretion  and 
depletion. Under this method, when liabilities for dismantlement and abandonment costs, excluding salvage values, are 
initially  recorded,  the  carrying  amount  of  the  related oil  and natural  gas  properties  are  increased.   Accretion of  the 
liability is recognized each period using the interest method of allocation, and the capitalized cost is depleted over the 
useful life of the related asset.
Contingencies
Liabilities and other contingencies are recognized upon determination of an exposure, which when analyzed 
indicates that it is both probable that an asset has been impaired or that a liability has been incurred and that the amount 
of such loss is reasonably estimable. 
 
Volatility of Oil and Natural Gas Prices
Our revenues, future rate of growth, results of operations, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or 
obtain additional capital, as well as the carrying value of our properties, are substantially dependent upon prevailing 
prices of oil and natural gas.
Acquisition and Disposition of Oil and Natural Gas Properties
On January 13, 2005, the Company executed a purchase and sale agreement with ARCOA Oil & Gas, Inc. 
(“ARCOA”),  which  was  subsequently  amended  in  March  2005.    Under  the  terms  of  the  agreement,  as  amended, 
ARCOA acquired a net profits interest in three wells on the Company’s Bateman Lake property for up to $1,150,000.  
The  net  profits  interest  is  initially  payable  out  of  75%  of  the  monthly  cash  flows,  as  defined,  attributable  to  the 
Company’s interest in such wells until payout, including a 12% rate of return.  The net profits interest will then be 
reduced to 65% until the well has produced a total of $7 million of net cash flow to the Company’s working interest.
24
The net profits interest will be further reduced to 60% when the net cash flows attributable to the Company’s working 
interest reaches a total of $9 million.  At that time, the net profits interest will be reduced to 30% which will be the net 
profits percentage there after.  To the extent that ARCOA elects to acquire a net profits interest of less than $1,150,000 
the  net  profits  amounts  will  be  proportionately  reduced.    Further  more,  after  June  1,  2006,  ARCOA  may  elect  to 
convert its net profits interest into common stock of the Company at a conversion rate of $1.25 per share.  The value of 
the net profits interest will be determined based upon the net cash flows attributable to the reserves, discounted at 15%.  
ARCOA has until December, 31, 2005 to fund and close the transaction.  However, such date may be extended by 
mutual agreement.  The Company has received a total of $645,000 in payments from ARCOA from the inception of 
this agreement through October 31, 2005 representing its purchase of net profits interests in certain oil and natural gas 
wells.
On July 29, 2005, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Viking. Viking is 
a UK registered company with offices in London and owns a 26% interest in a company that owns the North Yorkshire 
gas  fields  (an  extension  of  the  Southern  North  Sea  Gas  Basin  onshore).  The  properties  include  licenses  covering 
approximately  100,000  acres  onshore  including,  four  proved  producing  fields,  two  proved  undeveloped  fields  and 
additional seismically mapped low risk exploration potential. Upon closing of this acquisition, the Company delivered 
400,000  shares  of  its  common  stock,  valued  at  $128,000,  to  Viking  for  distribution  to  its  shareholders,  with  an 
obligation to deliver an additional 1.6 million shares of its common stock if certain defined goals are met or six months 
from the acquisition, unless there is a foreclosure on the assets of Viking's interest in the gas fields.  Such additional 
shares, valued at $512,000 were issued on October 18, 2005.  Viking’s interest in the gas fields is security for debt in 
Viking Petroleum UK, Limited.  Such debt is not currently in default, however the Company has no assurance that an 
event of default will not occur.  Additionally, prior to the closing of the acquisition, the Company advanced $127,757 
to Viking for working capital purposes.  This amount is considered a component of the purchase price paid to acquire 
the stock of Viking.  This transaction has been recorded using the purchase method of accounting and the results of 
operations subsequent to July 29, 2005 are recorded in the consolidated results of operations of the Company.
On  October  7,  2005,  the  Company  entered  into  an  agreement  with  Marathon  Capital,  LLC  (“Marathon”)  and  U.S. 
Energy  Systems,  Inc. (“USEY”)  to  jointly  acquire  the assets  owned by  Viking Petroleum  UK  Limited,  an  entity  in 
which the Company owns a 26% interest through its wholly owned subsidiary Viking.  The acquisition will be made 
through a newly created entity which will be owned 25% by each of Marathon and the Company in consideration of 
their contribution of assets and/or services, and 50% will be owned by an entity USEY will organize in consideration of 
a  capital  contribution  of  up  to  $5  million.    It  is  anticipated  that  the  aggregate  purchase  price  for  the  assets  will  be 
approximately  $60  million,  of  which  $5  million  will  consist  of  the  contributed  capital.    Additional  funding  of  the 
acquisition is expected to consist of project financing secured by the acquired assets. 
 
Item 3.     Controls and Procedures
Disclosure  controls  and  procedures  are  controls  and  other  procedures  that  are  designed  to  ensure  that 
information required to be disclosed in Company reports filed or submitted under the Security and Exchange Act are 
recorded,  processed,  summarized  and  reported  within  the  time  periods  specified  in  the  Securities  and  Exchange 
Commission’s  rules  and  forms.    Disclosure  controls  and  procedures  include,  without  limitation,  controls  and 
procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Company reports filed under the Securities 
and Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company’s President and Chief 
Executive  Officer  and  the  Chief  Financial  Officer,  as  appropriate,  to  allow  timely  decisions  regarding  required 
disclosure. 
 
The Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (collectively, the “Certifying Officers”) 
are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Securities Exchange 
Act Rule 13a-15(e)) for the Company. Such officers have concluded (based upon their evaluation of these controls and 
procedures  as  of  a  date  within  90  days  of  the  filing  of  this  report)  that  the  Company’s  disclosure  controls  and 
procedures  are  not  adequate  and  effective  for  purposes  of  Rule 13a-14(c) in  timely  alerting  them  to  material 
information  relating  to  the  Company  required  to  be  included  in  the  Company’s  filings  with  the  SEC  under  the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The reasons for our determination that our internal controls and procedures are not 
effective are detailed below. 
 
 
The Company currently employs one person in the accounting department (the Chief Financial Officer) who is 
responsible  for  the  day  to  day  accounting  and  SEC  reporting  function  of  the  Company.    Daily  transactions  are 
accounted for, reconciled and processed to our accounting records solely by this person.  This is considered a material 
weakness due to lack of segregation of responsibilities.  The lack of resources in the accounting and reporting function
25
of our internal controls also resulted in the Company not being able to file its quarterly financial statements during the 
year ended April 30, 2005 and for the quarterly periods ended July 31, 2005 and October 31, 2005 on a timely basis.  
As of the date of this filing the Company is compliant in all of its filings.  Furthermore, during the course of completing 
the audit for the year ended April 30, 2005, several accounting adjustments were identified requiring adjustments to the 
current year and restatement of the financial statements for the year ended April 30, 2004 and to various of its Form 10-
QSBs for each respective year. 
 
 
As a result of the items mentioned above, the Company has a material weakness in its internal control over the 
financial reporting and disclosure function due to the lack accounting resources available for the daily processing of 
transactions and account reconciliations and the reporting of our financial statements within the appropriate filings in 
the  time  required.    This  void  in  available  accounting  resources  increases  the  likelihood  to  more  than  remote  that  a 
material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected in a 
timely manner.
Executive management of the Company is currently evaluating its accounting resource needs and anticipates 
employing further accounting assistance in the near term.  Management believes that additional accounting assistance, 
including increased technical resources, will mitigate the circumstances that have resulted in our evaluation of internal 
controls and procedures as having material weaknesses.
There  has  been  no  change  in  our  internal  controls  over  financial  reporting  that  occurred  during  the  three 
months ended October 31, 2005 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal 
controls over financial reporting.
