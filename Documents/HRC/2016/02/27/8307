<p><b> I.  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In 2001, the then Commission on Human Rights (and subsequently, the Human 
Rights Council) stressed the need to develop a set of principles on the implementation of 
existing human rights norms and standards in the fight against extreme poverty. In 
response, the then Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights 
entrusted an ad hoc group of experts with the task of preparing the draft guiding principles 
on extreme poverty and human rights. These were submitted by the Sub-Commission to the 
Human Rights Council at its second session in 2006 (A/HRC/2/2-A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36) and 
approved by the Council in its resolution 2006/9. From 2006 to 2009 the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) led consultations on the draft guiding 
principles. The views of States, United Nations agencies and intergovernmental 
organizations, treaty bodies and special procedures, national human rights institutions, non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) and other stakeholders were compiled and analysed in 
a report presented to the Council in 2009 (A/HRC/11/32). Following these consultations, 
the Human Rights Council invited the then independent expert on the question of human 
rights and extreme poverty (now the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human 
rights), Magdalena Sepulveda Carmona, to facilitate the further progress of the draft 
guiding principles by providing recommendations to assist States in improving the draft and 
incorporating the outcomes of the consultations. She presented her report to the Council in 
September 2010 (A/HRC/15/41). In response, the Council invited OHCHR to hold a broad 
consultation on the draft guiding principles on the basis of the annotated outline that was 
included in the above report. The objective of this consultation was to gain input from a 
broad range of actors, particularly States and development practitioners, so that consensus 
and collective agreement could be reached on the draft guiding principles. The present 
report details the outcome of these consultations.1 On its basis, the Special Rapporteur will 
submit a final draft of the DGPs to the Human Rights Council in September 2012.    
</p>
<p>2. In view of its purpose to support the Special Rapporteur in her elaboration of the 
final draft as well as to facilitate further input on part of stakeholders, the present report is 
structured in line with the annotated draft guiding principles (see HRC/15/41, annex) and 
the questions put to stakeholders in the questionnaire attached to the Special Rapporteur&#8223;s 
report. Submissions and statements have, thus, been analysed and sorted in relation to the 
section and, where applicable, the paragraph or letter to which they refer, together with 
short section summaries providing an overview of comments. The questions from the 
questionnaire on each section have been reproduced at each section heading.  
</p>
<p><b> II.  General views on the draft guiding principles 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Convergences 
</b></p>
<p>3. The revisions to the current draft of the guiding principles proposed by the Special 
Rapporteur were broadly endorsed. Stakeholders strongly supported the special emphasis 
given, throughout the draft, to women and children as a category of vulnerability cutting 
across all other groups. It was generally agreed that extreme poverty had tangible but also 
intangible features, most notably the discrimination and social stigma attached to it and the 
processes and institutions that produced it. There was considerable convergence among 
parties on the need to include a dedicated paragraph on corruption, and to make more 
</p>
<p>  
 1 On the basis of written submissions and oral statements made at a consultation meeting held in 
</p>
<p>Geneva on 22 and 23 June 2011. </p>


<p>explicit mention of poverty-reinforcing aspects of administrative processes. Furthermore, 
several stakeholders called for a greater emphasis on human rights education as an anti-
poverty strategy, as well as to more explicit mention of the role of the media in producing 
and combating social stigma. There were also recurrent calls for more significant treatment 
of structural causes of extreme poverty; these included the global economic system and the 
debt crisis, the conduct of transnational corporations, the status of the right to development, 
and the global environment and climate change. Several parties also urged a more direct 
approach to social security, as articulated in such concepts as essential social transfers or 
social minimums. Recurrent mention was also made of the need to call on States to 
implement fiscal policies aimed at raising the revenues necessary to implement the draft&#8223;s 
agenda. Stakeholders also broadly agreed on the desirability to make the draft guiding 
principles&#8223; complementarity vis-&#224;-vis other existing international instruments combating 
(extreme) poverty more explicit,2 as well as on the importance to emphasize the role played 
by non-State actors in combating extreme poverty. Finally, it was repeatedly suggested to 
include a concrete and detailed implementation strategy for the draft guiding principles, so 
as to underline their objective of being practical and practicable.  
</p>
<p><b>  Points for clarification 
</b></p>
<p>4. A few issues require further clarification: firstly, all stakeholders agreed with the 
focus on women and children as the key categories cutting across all forms of exposure to 
extreme poverty. Several parties proposed to mention further categories as being 
particularly exposed, most notably those involving (old) age, disabilities, migration, refuge 
and asylum, ethnic, racial or linguistic minority status, disease (in particular HIV/AIDS), 
traditional social status (such as caste), location (especially for those in rural areas), and 
descent, especially indigenous descent. Secondly, stakeholders  pointed out that the nature 
of the obligations mentioned in the draft guiding principles needed to be clarified and that a 
line needed to be drawn between references to pre-existing legal obligations, on one hand, 
and consensus-based principles and policies, on the other hand. Such clarification also 
implied, thirdly, explicit statements on the justiciability of at least some of the obligations 
mentioned in the draft guiding principles, in particular those related to recognized civil, 
political, economic, social, and cultural rights. Fourthly, although most parties stated that 
they thought the rights listed in the draft guiding principles were comprehensive in relation 
to their objectives, there were, nonetheless, several suggestions for specific rights (issues) 
to be included or highlighted. Several parties highlighted the right to food and to safe 
drinking water and sanitation, as well as the importance of the right to privacy and to family 
life. Furthermore, several civil and political rights were suggested for explicit mention, 
among them the freedom of expression and of religion.  
</p>
<p>  
 2  Instruments specifically mentioned were the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, the Guiding Principles on Human 
Rights and Business, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)&#8223;s Voluntary 
Guidelines on Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land and Forests exercise, the International 
Labour Organization&#8223;s (ILO) Decent Work Agenda, the Global Compact, or OHCHR&#8223;s own 
Principles and Guidelines on a Human Rights Approach to Poverty Reduction Strategies. </p>


<p><b> III.  Analytical compilation of comments on the draft guiding 
principles 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. General comments 
</b></p>
<p>5. In his opening remarks to the Consultation, the <b>Permanent Representative of 
France, Jean-Baptiste Mattei</b>, pointed out that the approach taken by the Guiding 
Principles was based on the interdependence and indivisibility of all human rights, as well 
as on the principles of participation by and empowerment of people living in extreme 
poverty. The <b>High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navanethem Pillay</b>, stressed the 
entanglement of extreme poverty and human rights: on one hand, those living in extreme 
poverty were often also deprived of their human rights, both civil and political and 
economic and social, on the other hand, a human rights approach to the alleviation of 
extreme poverty was crucial for understanding and counteracting the condition. The 
<b>President of the Human Rights Council, Laura Dupuy Lasserre, Permanent 
</b></p>
<p><b>Representative of Uruguay</b>, added that many of the written submissions received 
converged on several core observations in relation to extreme poverty, notably on the 
importance of human dignity, non-discrimination, access to basic goods and services, an 
effective rule of law fostering the realization of human rights, a recognition of the 
heightened vulnerability of specific groups, and an integrated vision of human 
development.  
</p>
<p>6. The <b>Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Magdalena 
Sepulveda Carmona,</b> noted that when considering revisions and additions to the current 
DGPs, stakeholders should bear in mind their overall purpose as practical guidance for 
policy-makers, an advocacy tool for anti-poverty campaigners, and, most importantly, a 
means of empowerment for persons living in extreme poverty. She said that a rights-based 
approach to poverty reduction did represent an added value, both in terms of understanding 
the causes of poverty and in formulating responses to it. She also stated that the process had 
been initiated by States and it was, therefore, fundamental that States took an active part in 
the DGPs finalization. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Regarding p</b>art II: &#8220;Rationale for the development of guiding principles 
on human rights and extreme poverty&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Question</b>: &#8220;Based on the report of the independent expert (HRC/15/41), what would be t<i>he 
</i>added value of guiding principles on human rights and extreme poverty?&#8221;  </p>
<p>7. The <b>Government of Canada</b> and the <b>National Human Rights Commission of 
France</b> recalled the definitions of poverty elaborated by the Committee on Economic 
Social and Cultural Rights, the Subcommission on the Promotion and Protection of Human 
Rights, the former independent expert on extreme poverty and human rights and other 
bodies, and recommended that the DGPs should take a broad and all-inclusive approach to 
the issue of extreme poverty. In this vein <b>Edmund Rice International (ERI)</b> added that 
the focus should be on the structural causes of extreme poverty, of which social exclusion 
and discrimination were already identified in the current draft guiding principles. 
</p>
<p>8. The <b>Government of Guatemala</b> welcomed the focus on specific vulnerable groups 
and the special emphasis given to women and children. The <b>Governments of Morocco </b>and 
of<b> the Philippines</b>, however, reiterated the DGPs&#8223; stated purpose to not focus in detail on 
specific vulnerable groups, and, indeed, to not create a new vulnerable group, though they 
did approve of the privileged space given to women and children throughout the draft.  </p>


<p>9. The <b>National Human Rights Commission of Azerbaijan (Human Rights 
Ombudsman)</b> and the <b>Quatar National Human Rights Committee</b> emphasized the 
added value that lay in specifically addressing stigmatization and discrimination of the 
poor.  
</p>
<p>10.<b> </b>The <b>Governments of Peru</b> <b>and of Sweden</b> both pointed to the central role 
empowerment played in the fight against extreme poverty. However, they also drew 
attention to the fact that it was not human rights that empowered people living in extreme 
poverty but that the former merely served as an instrument for the latter to empower 
themselves. In this sense, the draft guiding principles provided a framework for the 
recognition of human rights claims of people living in extreme poverty.  
</p>
<p>11<b>. </b>The <b>Governments of Bulgaria, the Philippines, Slovenia, and</b> <b>South Africa</b> as 
well as the <b>National Human Rights Commission of Mexico </b>and the<b> South African 
Human Rights Commission, </b>the <b>Communit&#225; Papa Giovanni, </b>the <b>Congregation of Our 
Lady of the Missions, International Disability Alliance (IDA) </b>and the<b> Subcommittee on 
Poverty Eradication </b>emphasized that the draft guiding principles were an element of 
United Nations human rights monitoring and, as such, should be treated as a both a 
complement to and a concretization and clarification of existing international obligations 
addressing extreme poverty. A particular synergy existed in relation to the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights for which the draft guiding principles 
should serve as an implementation device. They should, therefore, explicitly remind States 
of the obligations they have assumed under the Covenant, fulfilment of which was a 
measuring rod for their commitment to fight extreme poverty.  
</p>
<p>12<b>. </b>The <b>Government of Peru</b> as well as the <b>North-South Institute (NSI)</b> stated that 
the ways in which the guiding principles might contribute to the implementation of the 
Millennium Development Goals  should be treated here. They proposed that the draft 
guiding principles specify, for instance, how empowerment would proceed in practice by 
calling for the drafting of specific &#8220;how to&#8221; manuals. 
</p>
<p>13. The <b>Governments of Finland and of</b> <b>Mexico</b> proposed to include, in the Rationale, 
a reference to the economic benefits of poverty eradication, as well as the strengthening of 
social cohesion as a result of the reduction of social inequality, especially in post-conflict 
and transition societies. The <b>Government of Bolivia</b> added that the general outlook  that 
the draft guiding principles took on poverty should be social and economic with a view to 
fostering different forms of economic redistribution as a core objective. 
</p>
<p>14. The <b>Government of Lithuania</b> pointed out, that the guiding principles might more 
clearly reflect the importance of society-wide commitment to poverty reduction, that is, not 
only governments but also civil society and business were to engage in this endeavour. 
</p>
<p>15. The <b>Government of Canada</b> drew attention to the fact that, given the non-
mandatory character of the Guiding Principles, mandatory language should be avoided 
throughout the document.  
</p>
<p><b>  Analytic conclusions on the section 
</b></p>
<p>16. There was broad consensus that the DGPs should be seen as complementary with 
other human rights instruments,3 especially the International Covenant on Economic, 
</p>
<p>  
 3  See submissions by the Governments of Bulgaria, the Philippines, Slovenia, and South Africa as well 
</p>
<p>as by the National Human Rights Commission of Mexico and the South African Human Rights 
Commission, and the Communit&#225; Papa Giovanni, the Congregation of Our Lady of the Missions, 
International Disability Alliance (IDA) and the Subcommittee on Poverty Eradication at 
www.ohchr.org. </p>


<p>Social, and Cultural Rights, and that they served as an important framework for MDG and 
post-MDG implementation.4 They were to be seen in the wider context of social and 
economic governance.5 Virtually all parties agreed with the focus on cross-cutting 
conditions in general, and the special emphasis given to women and children, in particular. 
A number of further conditions were mentioned by individual parties, though all agreed that 
a broad and all-inclusive focus should be maintained. This consensus should also inform 
any discussion on the viability of a specific definition of extreme poverty. Furthermore, 
parties highlighted the importance of addressing stigmatization and discrimination6 as 
structural causes of extreme poverty, as well as the reliance on empowerment7 as a core 
element of the fight against extreme poverty.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Regarding p</b>art III: &#8220;Conceptual framework&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Question</b>: &#8220;Co<i>nsidering that the majority of those living in extreme poverty are children, 
should the guiding principles have a dedicated section on this specific group or should this 
</i></p>
<p><i>issue be cutting across the text? (A/HRC/15/41, para. 19); and what about other specific 
</i></p>
<p>groups?&#8221; </p>
<p>17. The <b>Governments of Canada, Chile, Lithuania, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, 
and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland </b>as well as the 
<b>International Commission of Jurists</b> observed that children were a pre-eminently 
important group among those especially vulnerable to extreme poverty. However, they also 
agreed that child poverty had to be seen in the context of the poverty of their parents and, 
generally, as a cross-cutting issue of the broader societal problem of extreme poverty. 
Special attention should be paid to street children and girl children who were frequently 
victims of both extreme poverty and gender-related discrimination. The <b>Special 
Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, Najat 
</b></p>
<p><b>M</b>&#8217;<b>jiid Maalla</b> added that the issue of children living in extreme poverty should be based 
on the four guiding principles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, namely that 
children living in extreme poverty should be recognized by the law, that their rights and 
dignity should be respected, that their physical and mental integrity, their security and their 
development should be protected, and that their free expression should be encouraged and 
taken into consideration. Likewise, children living in extreme poverty should enjoy the full 
protection of economic and social rights.  
</p>
<p>18. The <b>Governments of Argentina, Canada, Ecuador, Finland, France, and 
Germany</b>, as well as the<b> National Human Rights Commissions of India, Jordan, 
Malaysia and South Africa </b>and the<b> Bosnia and Herzegovina Ombudsman</b> emphasized 
the appropriateness of including specific mention of other vulnerable groups, in particular 
women, older persons, people with disabilities, including those rendered invalid through 
armed conflict, migrant workers, refugees and asylum seekers, ethnic, racial and linguistic 
minorities, people with HIV/AIDS, people of lower castes, the rural poor, and indigenous 
people. They contended that these groups suffered from multiple forms of discrimination 
and were most in need of protection. Not only should the misfortune of these groups cut 
across the entire text of the guiding principles, there should also be a specific segment that 
recognized them as key target groups for a multifaceted approach towards the eradication of 
poverty.

 6  See submissions of the National Human Rights Commission of Azerbaijan (Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Ombudsman) and the Qatar National Human Rights Committee. 
 7  The Governments of Peru and Sweden. </p>


<p>19. The <b>Government of Canada</b> drew attention to the need to clearly distinguish 
between State and non-State actors and their respective human rights obligations. States as 
the primary holders of international obligations had a duty to respect and fulfil, whereas 
non-State actors had a duty to protect as well as to promote human rights. In this context, 
the <b>Government of South Africa </b>stressed the co-responsibility of corporations for 
environmental degradation, sub-standard labour conditions and child labour.  
</p>
<p><b>  Analytic conclusion on the section 
</b></p>
<p>20. Submissions on this section reiterate and concretise some of the main points brought 
up in the discussion on the Rationale. All parties, again, agreed with the focus on women 
and children as the key categories cutting across all forms of exposure to extreme poverty. 
Several parties proposed to mention further categories as being particularly exposed, most 
notably (old) age, disabilities, migration, refuge and asylum, ethnic, racial or linguistic 
minority status, disease (in particular HIV/AIDS), traditional social status (such as caste), 
location (especially in rural areas), and descent, especially indigenous descent. 
Furthermore, the specificity of non-State actors, and, in particular, corporations, both in 
relation to the nature of obligations attributable to them as well as their co-responsibility for 
aspects of extreme poverty, was recurrently pointed out. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Regarding p</b>art IV: &#8220;Overview of the main underlying and reinforcing 
<b>deprivations faced by </b>persons living in extreme poverty&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Question</b>: &#8220;Would you identify other underlying and reinforcing deprivations and 
<i>obstacles faced by persons in extreme poverty, in addition to the ones included in this 
</i></p>
<p>section of the report?&#8221;<b>  
</b></p>
<p>21. The <b>Government of South Africa </b>as well as the<b> Congregation of Our Lady, </b>the 
<b>International Budget Partnership (IBP) </b>and the<b> International Human Rights 
Internship Program (IHRIP)</b> recommended adding a reference to the larger economic 
context which impacted on the incidence of extreme poverty. They noted, in particular, 
distortions of trade and the global financial crisis and observed that fiscal policy and the 
negative impact of public debt were often implicated in extreme poverty. 
</p>
<p>22. The <b>Governments of Ecuador and Finland </b>as well as the<b> National Human 
Rights Commission of Mexico </b>and the<b> United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR)</b> proposed that several groups might be additionally mentioned here as 
being particularly subject to direct or indirect discriminatory practices, notably girl 
children, rural migrants and migrant children, as well as people with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>23. The <b>Government of Norway </b>and <b>Switzerland</b>&#8217;s<b> Subcommittee on Poverty 
Eradication, </b>as well as<b> the ATD Fourth World Movement,</b> <b>Eurochild</b>, and <b>UN-Habitat</b> 
all expressed concern that certain conditions specifically added to vulnerability to extreme 
poverty; among these were maternal and child health, as well as mental health issues, 
personal debt, drug addiction, unsafe housing, and statelessness and internal displacement. 
</p>
<p><b>  Analytic conclusions on the section 
</b></p>
<p>24. Responses to this part of the draft guiding principles oscillated between the macro  
and the micro levels. On the former, some parties called for a more explicit mention of the </p>


<p>broader economic framework8 within which extreme poverty occurred. On the micro-level, 
in turn, parties proposed to include a number of group categories to be potentially added to 
those already listed in this section; they include girl children, rural migrants and migrant 
children, and people with disabilities, as well as maternal and child health, as well as 
mental health issues, personal debt, drug addiction, unsafe housing, and statelessness and 
internal displacement.9 
</p>
<p><b> E. Regarding part V: </b>&#8220;<b>Proposals for improving the draft guiding 
principles on extreme poverty and human rights</b>&#8221;10<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Question</b>: &#8220;Are there any important aspects or issues missing in the annotated outline for 
guiding principles proposed in this section of the report?&#8221;  </p>
<p>25. The <b>Government of Chile</b> reiterated (regarding para. 34) that the core deprivations 
of persons living in extreme poverty were a lack of access to public services and non-
compliance with their fundamental rights. The causes for these needed to be identified, 
appropriate programmes put in place, and monitoring mechanisms established.  
</p>
<p>26. The <b>Governments of Ecuador, Finland and South Africa</b> stated (regarding para. 
36) that mention could be made of other non-State actors, besides international 
organizations and transnational corporations, as bearers of human rights responsibility. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Regarding part V, section 1: </b>&#8220;<b>Overarching human rights principles</b>&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Questions</b>: &#8220;Is the list of human rights prin<i>ciples in this section (headings A to G) 
sufficiently comprehensive or should any other principles be included in the guiding 
</i></p>
<p>principles on extreme poverty and human rights?&#8221;  </p>
<p><b>  </b>&#8220;Are there any important aspects or issues missing in the recommendations in bold 
</p>
<p><i>proposed under each of the overarching human rights principles in this section of the 
</i></p>
<p>report?&#8221; </p>
<p>27. The <b>Government of Ecuador</b> proposed that, in relation to the text under heading C, 
the inverse of discrimination, namely diversity be mentioned as a crucial condition for the 
fight against poverty. In addition, specific mention of discrimination in the work place as 
well as in relation to social security, particularly as experienced by women, should be 
included here. In relation to heading F, it observed that the issue of intellectual property and 
collective rights ought to be mentioned. 
</p>
<p>28. The <b>Government of Egypt</b> stated that the rights-based approach to the eradication 
of extreme poverty had to be seen in the context of the rights-based approach to

Commissioner for Refugees, as well as the Subcommittee on Poverty Eradication, ATD Fourth World 
Movement, and Eurochild. 
</p>

according to the paragraph they refer to in the draft guiding principles. Full submissions are available 
online at www.ohchr.org </p>


<p>development. It also drew attention to what it characterised as the policy-oriented approach 
adopted in the recent Guiding Principles on Human Rights and Business.  
</p>
<p>29. The <b>Government of Finland</b> and the <b>National Human Rights Commission of 
Jorda </b>recommended that an explicit reference be made to the right to self-determination. 
</p>
<p>30. The <b>Government of France</b> proposed, in relation to the text under heading D that 
gender equality in marriage should be mentioned. A general effort should be made to avoid 
gender-stereotyping. With regard to heading E, it emphasized that participation was of 
fundamental importance and should imply active involvement in the formulation of public 
policy.  
</p>
<p>31. The <b>Government of Peru</b> recommended that, under heading E, migrants be 
included among those vulnerable groups whose representation in the decision-making 
process ought to be ensured. In relation to heading F, it called for the media to be 
recognized as a relevant stakeholder in the provision of transparency and access to 
information.  
</p>
<p>32. The <b>Government of the Philippines</b> observed that the draft guiding principles 
ought to reflect the principle of progressive realization adopted in the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It also urged that the draft guiding 
principles not be overloaded with issues but remained a text understandable and usable by 
&#8220;real people&#8221;. In relation to heading B, it suggested that the notion of empowerment was 
closely related to agency and autonomy. In relation to heading C, it recommended that the 
paragraph&#8223;s language reflect the draft guiding principles&#8223; intent to avoid the creation of a 
new vulnerable group. In relation to heading D, it proposed that children be added to 
women as a vulnerable group that merited special promotion. In relation to heading E, it 
suggested to include mention of access to information and human rights education. In 
relation to heading G, it added that the justiciability of rights fostering the empowerment of 
persons living in extreme poverty ought to be assured.  
</p>
<p>33. The<b> Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b>(<b>UNHCR)</b> recommended using the draft guiding principles as an appropriate forum to give 
refugees and non-citizens more direct participation. The information should also be 
available in various languages. 
</p>
<p>34. The <b>ATD Fourth World Movement</b> recommended, in relation to heading B, to 
attach an additional principle after heading D entitled &#8220;adopting a multidimensional 
approach against poverty&#8221;. Furthermore, it recommended merging headings B and E.  
</p>
<p>35. The <b>Government of Chile</b> and the <b>Child Fund Angola</b> proposed that the right to 
identity should be included in the section on overarching human rights principles. 
</p>
<p>36. The <b>International Commission of Jurists (ICJ)</b> proposed, in relation to heading B, 
to add an explicit reference to sexual orientation and gender identity as prohibited grounds 
of discrimination as required by international human rights law and recognised in UN 
jurisprudence. In addition, and in relation to heading C, it highlighted the importance to pay 
special attention to the expectations and needs of people living in rural areas. 
</p>
<p>37. The <b>North-South Institute (NSI)</b> suggested that the right to self-determination be 
mentioned in relation to indigenous peoples, in particular with regard to land rights relating 
to traditional territory. In relation to heading D, it proposed to mention sexual violence, 
assault and exploitation. It also recommended drawing attention to the specific vulnerability 
of girls.  
</p>
<p>38. Recalling the preamble of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, <b>Association</b> 
<b>Points-Coeur</b> proposed that the centrality of the family as society&#8223;s basic unit should be 
mentioned in an additional paragraph. In relation to heading C it observed that it was </p>


<p>through human rights education that providers of public and private services would become 
sensitive to the issue at hand. In relation to heading G, it noted that the most effective way 
to prevent violations of the human rights of persons living in extreme poverty was, again, 
human rights education throughout all stages of schooling and study. 
</p>
<p>39. <b>Zdzislaw Kedzia, member of the Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural 
Rights,</b> recommended that the rights-based approach to alleviate extreme poverty ought to 
be specially highlighted as an alternative to a needs-based approach and as fostering 
empowerment. He also proposed to complement the reference to human dignity with the 
definition of poverty adopted by the Convention as a &#8220;human condition characterized by the 
sustained or chronic deprivation of the resources, capabilities, choices, security and power 
necessary for the enjoyment of an adequate standard of living and other civil, cultural, 
economic, political and social rights as enshrined in the international human rights 
instruments&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>40. <b>Eitan Felner, independent expert, </b>proposed, in relation to heading C, that a 
recommendation be added that States review legislation for built-in biases against the poor. 
In relation to heading E, he suggested that a call for States to proactively empower persons 
living in (extreme) poverty be added. In relation to heading G, he urged that 
recommendations be added that civil servants be held responsible for discriminatory 
conduct vis-&#224;-vis persons living in extreme poverty, and that party political and clientelistic 
systems functioning in a discriminatory manner be overhauled.  
</p>
<p>41. The <b>Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography, Najat M</b>&#8217;<b>jiid Maalla</b>, listed the human rights principles particularly 
important for children: these included equality and non-discrimination on the basis of age, 
the prohibition of gender-based discrimination of girls, access to information, and the right 
to an effective remedy. She added that special attention should be paid to the four founding 
principles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, notably non-discrimination (art. 2),  
the prevalence of the best interest of the child (art. 3), the right to life, survival and 
development (art. 6), and participation (art. 12).  
</p>
<p>42. The <b>Government of Mexico</b> called, in relation to heading A, for mention of the 
importance of administrative coordination of anti-poverty programmes and of linking social 
and economic programming. 
</p>
<p>43. The <b>Government of Morocco</b> suggested, under heading A, adding the right to 
education, labour rights, property rights and the right to live a life on a sufficient level.  
</p>
<p>44. The <b>National Human Rights Commission of Jordan</b> recommended including, 
under heading A, a reference to non-State actors, particularly to international aid and 
development agencies. 
</p>
<p>45. The <b>Institut Interdisciplinaire d</b>&#8217;<b>Ethique et des Droits de l</b>&#8217;<b>Homme (IIEDH) 
</b>stated that human dignity, universality, and the interdependence and invisibility of human 
rights should be included, under heading A, at the beginning of the draft guiding principles. 
</p>
<p>46. The <b>Government of Albania</b> suggested that, also under heading A, gender 
discrimination on grounds of traditional practices be specifically mentioned.  
</p>
<p>47. The <b>General Secretary of the World YWCA, Nyaradzayi Gumbonzvanda</b>, 
reiterated that the DGPs represented a strategy for eradicating extreme poverty, especially 
in relation to women. She recalled the prominence of poverty on the Beijing Platform and 
set out several principles and objectives that might be additionally mentioned under 
heading D, notably empowerment.  </p>


<p>48. The <b>Government of Bolivia</b> recommended a specific mention of the importance of 
stakeholder participation in the formulation and implementation of public policies, under 
heading E, including and especially in relation to commercial policy.  
</p>
<p>49. The <b>Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography</b> called for the explicit mention, also under heading E, of the right of children 
living in extreme poverty to have access to information, to be able to freely express their 
views, and to have their opinions taken into consideration according to their age and degree 
of maturity. 
</p>
<p>50. The <b>Government of South Africa</b> recalled the importance of ensuring full 
justiciability of economic and social rights under heading G and, in the context of the South 
African experience, it specifically mentioned effective litigation for land rights and in 
relation to HIV/AIDS.  
</p>
<p><b>  Analytic conclusions on the section 
</b></p>
<p>51. As in the previous sections, there was broad consensus on the need to explicitly 
integrate the draft guiding principles with other human rights mechanisms,11 including the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights12 and its principle of 
progressive realization and with the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its founding 
principles.13 Furthermore, the importance of accountability of State institutions and civil 
servants was highlighted,14 as well as the need to render the rights framework fully 
justiciable in relation to conditions associated with the occurrence of extreme poverty.15 
The centrality of participation was pointed out,16 and the need to clearly expand the draft 
guiding principles framework to non-State actors was stressed,17 as was the correlation with 
the right to self-determination.18 
</p>
<p><b> G. Regarding part V, s</b>ection 2: &#8220;Overarching policy guidelines&#8221; <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Questions</b>: &#8220;Is the list of &#8222;overarching policy guidelines&#8223; in this section (headings H to K) 
<i>sufficiently comprehensive or should any other overarching policy guidelines be included in

</i></p>
<p>proposed under each of the overarching policy guidelines in this section of the report?&#8221; </p>
<p>52. The <b>Government of Canada</b> highlighted the importance of distinguishing between 
legal obligations and policy guidelines in the language of this section.  
</p>
<p>53. The <b>National Human Rights Commission of Jordan</b> proposed to include reference 
to &#8222;essential healthcare&#8223; under heading I. It also suggested that the monitoring role of 
international bodies should be mentioned under headings H and K. In relation to heading J

<p>it submitted that the phrase &#8222;sustainable strategies for international assistance and 
cooperation, favouring democratic governance and domestic capacity building&#8223; be inserted. 
</p>
<p>54. <b>Eitan Felner, independent expert</b>, proposed that a paragraph be added to this 
section specifically dealing with corruption. In particular, he suggested that States should 
enact legislation enforcing disclosure of income and assets of senior public officials, to 
ensure adequate income and decent working conditions for civil servants, to put in place 
complaints procedures and, generally, to identify and counteract the governance 
weaknesses that give rise to corruption. Under heading H, he suggested additionally 
recommending that States adopt fiscal policies enabling them to raise sufficient revenues 
for anti-poverty programmes, that they should be guided by the minimum core obligations 
set out in the context of economic, social and cultural rights, that anti-poverty budgets be 
entrenched, that data on extreme poverty be systematically procured, that anti-poverty 
programmes be comprehensive and multi-sectoral, endowed with targets and benchmarks, 
that geographic factors be considered in anti-poverty budgets, and that institutional designs 
that hamper anti-poverty programming be identified and reformed. In relation to heading I, 
he further recommended that States should adopt a demand-side perspective that 
encouraged persons living in extreme poverty to proactively use the services offered to 
them.  
</p>
<p>55. The <b>Government of Brazil</b> recalled, under heading H, its own efforts to identify 
and target poverty hotspots in the framework of its &#8220;Brazil without Misery&#8221; (<i>Brasil Sem 
Mis&#233;ria</i>) programme.  
</p>
<p>56. The <b>Government of Mexico</b> reiterated, under the same heading, the importance of 
transparency of social programmes, so that those living in extreme poverty could clearly 
identify whether they belonged to a particular vulnerable group and what benefits were 
available.  
</p>
<p>57. The Institut Interdisciplinaire d&#8217;Et<b>h</b>ique et des Droits de l&#8217;Homme (IIE<b>DH)</b> 
recommended that para. 54 under heading H be amended by the phrase &#8220;States set specific 
measures to monitor the implementation of programmes and public policies aimed at 
reducing extreme poverty&#8221;. It also suggested that the order of points be reversed so as to 
first mention data collection, then the formulation criteria. 
</p>
<p>58. The <b>Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography</b> stated, regarding heading H, that certain categories of children living in 
extreme poverty merited specific protection, notably homeless children, disabled children, 
unaccompanied migrant children, children working as domestic servants, children subject 
to child trafficking and sexual exploitation, and unregistered children.  
</p>
<p>59. The <b>Government of Ecuador</b> proposed, regarding heading I, that the co-
responsibility of corporations in providing facilities, goods, and services be mentioned.  
</p>
<p>60. The <b>Government of South Africa</b> submitted, also under heading I, that social 
cohesion strategies should be included in the draft guidelines and that a data system should 
be developed which would permit the mapping of household needs in basic infrastructure 
and basic services.  
</p>
<p>61. The <b>Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</b> 
proposed, under the same heading, that the introduction of a set of essential social transfers 
that were to be defined by States themselves and that were to provide minimum income 
security and access to basic services be recommended. 
</p>
<p>62. The <b>National Human Rights Commission of Ecuador (Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo) 
</b>proposed, also under heading I, to include a mention of food sovereignty as a means to 
ensure food self-sufficiency.  </p>


<p>63. The <b>International Budget Partnership (IBP) &amp; International Human Rights 
Internship Program (IHRIP)</b> proposed, under heading I, that a statement on the budgetary 
implications of fulfilling human rights obligations should be added here; specifically, they 
propose to add &#8220;in particular, the Government should ensure that its budget is raised, 
allocated and expended in line with its human rights obligations, most particularly the 
obligation of equality and non-discrimination. The rights of those living in extreme poverty 
should consistently be prioritized in budget allocations and expenditures, and these 
allocations and expenditures should not be reduced unless and until the government can 
document significant improvement in the situation of those living in extreme poverty&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>64. The <b>Government of Pakistan</b> reiterated, under heading J, the importance of 
international cooperation for any programme meant to effectively fight poverty. 
</p>
<p>65. The <b>World Food Programme </b> proposed, under the same heading, that the reference 
to capacity-building be linked to a call for the formulation of exit and handover strategies.  
</p>
<p>66. The <b>Comunit&#225; Papa Giovanni</b> proposed, also under heading J, to include a call for 
governments to fulfil the promise of contributing with 0.7 percent of GDP to Official 
Development Assistance.  
</p>
<p>67. The <b>Government of Morocco</b> stated, regarding heading K, that the draft guiding 
principles should endorse local ownership of the fight against poverty, and call for locally 
adapted measures.  
</p>
<p>68. The <b>Government of Sweden</b> proposed, under heading K, that specific mention to 
the ILO&#8223;s Decent Work Agenda, the United Nations Global Compact, the Guiding 
Principles on Human Rights and Business of John Ruggie, the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General, and related initiatives within the corporate sector be made here. 
</p>
<p><b>  Analytic conclusions of the section 
</b></p>
<p>69. An issue that appeared again in this section was corruption which, it was proposed, 
could be dealt with in a dedicated paragraph.19 Furthermore, it was also suggested that a 
clear implementation strategy be set out, including budgetary allocation, data collection, 
benchmarking, and monitoring.20 There might be a more specific focus on fiscal policy21 
and, again, on the inclusion of non-State actors.22 In terms of specific recommendations, the 
addition, inter alia, of food sovereignty23 and the idea of an essential social minimum24 was 
proposed.

<p><b> H. Regarding part V, s</b>ection 3: &#8220;Specific rights<b>-</b>based obligations&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Questions</b>: &#8220;Is the list of rights identified in this section sufficiently comprehensive 
<i>(headings L to W) or any other human rights should be also reflected in the guiding 
</i></p>
<p>principles?&#8221; </p>
<p> &#8220;Are there any important aspects or issues <i>missing in the recommendations in bold 
</i></p>
<p><i>proposed under each of the specific rights-</i>based obligations in this section of the report?&#8221;  </p>
<p><b>  Submissions 
</b></p>
<p>70. The <b>Government of Albania</b> proposed that, in relation to heading M, the co-
responsibility of the media for disrespecting private and family life especially when 
portraying women and children might be mentioned. It also observed, in relation to heading 
T, that the problems of rural labour and a relevant minimum wage policy be highlighted.  
</p>
<p>71. The <b>Government of Argentina</b> recalled article 23 of the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People and suggested that their right to self-
determination and their rights to land and other natural resources be mentioned here.  
</p>
<p>72. In relation to heading P, the <b>Government of Canada</b> drew attention to efforts 
currently undertaken by FAO to develop Voluntary Guidelines on Responsible Governance 
of Tenure of Land and Forests and it recommended that the draft guiding principles take 
these into consideration. It also pointed out, in relation to heading Q, that the precise nature 
of the obligation to provide free access to drinking water needed to be clarified. In relation 
to heading S, it proposed that, given its direct link with extreme poverty in many countries, 
HIV/AIDS might be given greater prominence room in the draft guiding principles. 
</p>
<p>73. The <b>Government of Finland</b> proposed to refer to the &#8220;eradication&#8221; rather than 
merely the &#8220;reduction&#8221; of homelessness in paragraph 80 under heading  R. Under heading 
S, it suggested to add reference to immigrants, regardless of their legal status, as rights-
holders.  
</p>
<p>74. The <b>Government of South Africa</b> recommended including, among the listed 
human rights obligations, the right to self-determination. It also stressed that, under heading 
L, a specific requirement for registration of newborn babies within 30 days be included.  
</p>
<p>75. The <b>Government of the United Kingdom</b> proposed that the draft guiding 
principles specify the sources for the obligations referred to, distinguishing between legal 
obligations and political commitments.  
</p>
<p>76. The <b>National Human Rights Commission of Azerbaijan</b> proposed the inclusion of 
a separate paragraph on children here. 
</p>
<p>77. The <b>National Human Rights Commission of Jordan</b> commented that a paragraph 
on the protection of the environment might be added. Furthermore, it proposed to include, 
under heading R, the obligation to pay compensation for forced eviction. Under letter T, 
slavery and servitude should be mentioned. Under heading U, the family and mothers 
should be added to the list of vulnerable groups.  
</p>
<p>78. The <b>World Food Programme </b>(<b>WFP)</b> proposed to include, under letter heading O, 
reference to the principles governing juvenile justice. Under letter heading P it added that 
the importance of early-warning mechanisms as a preventive measure of food crises should 
be mentioned.  
</p>
<p>79. The <b>ATD Fourth World Movement</b> commented with regard to heading M that 
specific mention might be made of the intrusion into their private and family life persons 
living in extreme poverty suffer in relation to applying for and receiving social services and </p>


<p>benefits. In relation to heading O it recommended that the DGPs call for access to justice to 
be free of charge and that the right of persons living in extreme poverty to an adequate legal 
defence when charged with an offence be fulfilled. In relation to heading T, it commented 
that the call for a &#8222;minimum wage&#8223; was insufficient, as many minimum wage policies 
provided too little for a dignified life. Hence, it proposed to substitute &#8222;minimum&#8223; with 
&#8222;decent&#8223; wage. In relation to heading V, it proposed that a call for the provision of 
mandatory schooling free of charge be inserted. In relation to heading W, it emphasised the 
importance of participation in cultural life as a crucial element of poverty alleviation.  
</p>
<p>80. The <b>Centre Europe-Tiers Monde (CETIM)</b> proposed the inclusion of a paragraph 
on the right to development.  
</p>
<p>81. The <b>Comunit&#225; Papa Giovanni</b> and the <b>Subcommittee on Poverty Eradication</b> 
commented that a number of core rights should additionally be dealt with in this section, 
notably the freedom of expression, the freedom of religion, and the right to a nationality.  
</p>
<p>82. The <b>Istituto Internazionale e Maria Ausiliatrice delle Salesiane di Don Bosco 
(IIMA)</b> recommended that, under heading L, registration mechanisms should be cost-free. 
It also suggested the addition, in the same paragraph, of further specifically vulnerable 
groups, notably refugees and migrants. It also proposed inclusion of further categories of 
vulnerable groups under heading N, namely indigenous peoples, refuges and migrants, and 
people living in emergency situations.  
</p>
<p>83. The <b>International Disability Alliance (IDA)</b> proposed to include, under heading N, 
a recommendation to ensure that persons with disabilities live in the community; under 
heading O reference to children with disabilities; and under heading Q mention of persons 
with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>84. The <b>Institut Interdisciplinaire d</b>&#8217;<b>Ethique et des Droits de l</b>&#8217;<b>Homme (IIEDH)</b> 
stressed that, if a human-rights lists approach was chosen in this section, it should cover all 
human rights.  
</p>
<p>85. The <b>Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography</b> also commented on specific aspects of this section: with regard to heading N, 
she stated that the need for children to have access to relevant complaint procedures and to 
effective remedies should be reiterated. Legislation specifically aimed at the protection and 
security of children living in extreme poverty should be called for, and the co-responsibility 
of private enterprise in preventing human rights abuses of these children should be 
emphasised. The special vulnerability of children living in extreme poverty in case of 
natural disaster or humanitarian emergency should also be mentioned. In relation to heading 
S, the Special Rapporteur called for a more explicit mention of the importance of access to 
good quality healthcare, in general, as well as to preventive medicine, health education, 
health care for pregnant women, and mental health, in particular. Health insurance for those 
living in extreme poverty and specifically including children should also be called for. In 
relation to heading U, she called for an explicit mention of the need to make social services 
accessible to children, as well as to ensure their continued support from infant age to the 
conclusion of their school education. In relation to heading V, she added that more explicit 
mention should be made to pre-school education, school attendance of girls, and school 
curriculum quality.  
</p>
<p>86. <b>Zdzislaw Kedzia, member of the Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural 
Rights</b>, commented that the demand for tailor-made services for vulnerable groups, as 
introduced under heading S in relation to the right to health, might be generalized 
throughout the section. Although an explicit targeting strategy risked reinforcing the stigma 
suffered by persons affected by a particular type of vulnerability, it might enhance 
effectiveness. He also reiterated the importance of pointing out the justiciability of all 
human rights. Furthermore, he proposed the inclusion, in this section, of trade union rights </p>


<p>and the special protection of the family. In more specific comments he stated, in relation to 
heading P, that a basic choice existed between treating all rights falling under this section 
distinctly or jointly in one paragraph. The right to food, in particular, needed to be 
addressed in greater detail and in relation to the work done by the Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights (general comment No. 12). He stressed the link between the 
right to food and a wider approach to social justice and pointed to the obligation of State 
Parties to alleviate hunger (art. 11). He proposed that the concepts of adequacy and 
sustainability of food availability, as developed in the general comment, be utilised in the 
draft guiding principles, and recommended that they also call for the development of 
national strategies for the eradication of hunger. Benchmarking should be introduced to 
provide for more accurate monitoring of state parties&#8223; performance in this regard. In 
</p>
<p>relation to heading Q, Mr. Kedzia proposed that the DGPs note that responsibility for the 
fulfilment of the right lay with state parties even where the provision of water and 
sanitation had been privatised or otherwise outsourced. In relation to heading R, he 
recommended that the guidelines complement the mentioned due process safeguards 
against forced eviction with entitlements as to compensation, the prohibition of eviction 
without alternative shelter, and the participation in the decision-making process by those 
under threat of eviction. He also proposed that specific vulnerable groups be highlighted, 
notably homeless persons and families, those inadequately housed and without ready access 
to basic amenities, those living in &#8222;illegal&#8223; settlements, those subject to forced eviction, and 
generally persons on a low income. In relation to heading T, Mr. Kedzia proposed several 
additions to the mentioned protections, namely compensation mechanisms and assistance in 
the event of loss of employment by the breadwinners of poor families, protection of 
pregnant women against the loss of employment, access to a first job as well as non-
discrimination on grounds of gender, age, and disability. 
</p>
<p>87. The <b>UNHCR</b> proposed, under heading L, to mention asylum-seekers and stateless 
persons as in special need of legal recognition.  
</p>
<p>88. The <b>National Human Rights Commission of Hungary</b> proposed, under heading N, 
to reverse the order of sections and have section 3 begin with the paragraph on the right to 
life. 
</p>
<p>89. <b>FIAN</b> pointed to the importance, under heading P, of taking into consideration both 
gender and cultural factors in food programmes.  
</p>
<p>90. The <b>Government of Algeria</b> and the International Commission of Jurists reiterated 
the importance, under headings P and Q,of the right to food and called for its greater 
prominence in this section.  
</p>
<p>91. The <b>Government of Switzerland</b> recommended that, under heading T,  specific 
mention of a minimum wage be omitted.  
</p>
<p><b>  Analytic conclusions of the section 
</b></p>
<p>92. In sum, the importance of drawing on <b>complementary mechanisms</b> or programs, 
especially in a United Nations context, was again highlighted in this section.25 Several 
issues were proposed for addition to those listed, among them <b>children</b>26 and the 
<b>environment</b>,27 the <b>right to food</b>,28 and the question of <b>access to safe drinking water and 
sanitation</b>.29

<p><b> IV.  Next steps 
</b></p>
<p>93. There was general agreement that the draft guiding principles, as annotated by the 
Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights and the inputs derived from the 
stakeholder consultation represented a good basis for a final draft of the guiding principles 
that would likely enjoy widespread support among State parties and other stakeholders. The 
consultation confirmed that the approach taken by the Special Rapporteur, in particular the 
focus on extreme poverty as a broad set of conditions that cross-cut different types of 
vulnerability, meets the approval of stakeholders and provides a promising basis for a 
successful conclusion of the draft guiding principles process in 2012.
