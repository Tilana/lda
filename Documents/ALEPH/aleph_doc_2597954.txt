Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 30 June 2016

1. Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies
A. General information
Bathurst Resources Limited (“Company" or "Parent") is a company incorporated and domiciled in New Zealand,
registered under the Companies Act 1993 and is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange ("ASX"). Eathurst
Resources Limited is a FMC Reporting Entity under Part 7 of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. These
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Part 7 ofthe Financial Markets
Conduct Act 2013 and ASX listing rules.
These financial statements have been approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 29 August 2016.
The financial statements presented herewith as at and for the year ended 30 June 2016 comprise the
Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group"). Joint Ventures are accounted for using
the equity method.
The Group is principally engaged in the exploration, development and production of coal.
B. Basis of preparation
Statement of compliance
These financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice in New Zealand (NZ GAAP). The Group is a for»profit entity forthe purposes of complying with NZ GAAP.
The consolidated financial statements comply with New Zealand equivalents to international Financial Reporting
Standards (NZ lFRSl, other New Zealand accounting standards and authoritative notices that are applicable to
entities that apply NZ IFRS. The consolidated financial statements also comply with international Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS).
These financial statements are presented in New Zealand dollars, which is the Company’s functional and
presentation currency. References in these financial statements to 'S’ and ’NZS‘ are to New Zealand dollars.
All financial information has been rounded to the nearest thousand unless otherwise stated.
C. Measurement basis
These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except certain financial
assets and liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
D. Critical estimates, judgements and errors
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors,
including expectations of future events that may have a ﬁnancial impact on the entity and that are believed to
be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by
definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a signiﬁcant risk of
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are
discussed below.

Bathurst Resources Limited
Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 30 June 2016
—%
(i) Impairment
The future recoverabllity of the assets recorded by the Group is dependent upon a number of factors, including
whether the Group decides to exploit its mine property itself or, if not, whether it successfully recovers the
related asset through sale.
Factors that could impact future recoverability include the level of reserves and resources, future technological
changes, costs of drilling and production, production rates, future legal changes, and changes to commodity
prices and foreign exchange rates.
(ii) Valuation of deferred consideration
In valuing the deferred consideration payable under business acquisitions management uses estimates and
assumptions. This includes future coal prices, discount rates, coal production, and the timing of payments. The
amounts of deferred consideration are reviewed at each balance date and updated based on best available
estimates and assumptions at that time.
The carrying amount of deferred consideration is set out in note 20.
(iii) Reserves & Resources
Reserves and resources are based on information compiled by a Competent Person as defined in accordance
with the Australasian Code of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves of 2012 lthe JORC code). There are numerous
uncertainties inherent in estimating reserves and assumptions that are valid at the time of EStimatiDl’l but that
may change signiﬁcantly when new information becomes available Changes in forecast prices of commodities,
exchange rates, production costs or recovery rates may change the economic status and may, ultimately, result
in the reserves being restated. Such changes in reserves could impact on depreciation and amortisation rates,
asset carrying values and provisions for rehabilitation,
(iv) Provision for rehabilitation
in calculating the estimated future costs of rehabilitating and restoring areas disturbed in the mining process
certain estimates and assumptions have been made. (Refer to Note 1(p)). The amount the Group is expected to
incur to settle these future obligations includes estimates in relation to the appropriate discount rate to apply
to the cash flow profile, expected mine life, application of the relevant requirements for rehabilitation, and the
future expected costs of rehabilitation.
Changes in the estimates and assumptions used could have a material impact on the carrying value of the
rehabilitation provision and related asset. The provision is reviewed at each reporting date and updated based
on the best available estimates and assumptions at that time.
The carrying amount ofthe rehabilitation provision is set out in Note 21.
(V) Waste in advance
Waste moved in advance is calculated with reference to the stripping ratio [waste moved over coal extracted)
of the area of interest and the excess of this ratio over the estimated stripping ratio for the area of interest
expected to incur over its life. Management estimates this life of mine ratio based on geological and survey
models as well as reserve information for the areas of interest.
{vi} Correction oferrarin movements in property, plant and equipment
Cost, depreciation and impairment have been restated as at and for the year ended 30 June 2015. The
restatement is to correct the classification of certain movements within fixed assets categories in 2014 and 2015.
This restatement has no impact on the closing net book value for 2015 or on the opening net book value as at
30 June 2014.

E. Principles of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect
these returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which
control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred
for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values ofthe assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former
owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the group. The consideration transferred includes the
fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets
acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at
their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any nonacontrolling interest in the acquiree on an
acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non»controlling interest‘s proportionate share of
the recognised amounts of acquiree's identifiable net assets.
Acquisition—related costs are expensed as incurred.
Contingent consideration (deferred consideration) to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at
the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be
a financial asset or financial liability is recognised in accordance with N2 [AS 39 in profit or loss as "fair value
(lossl/gain on deferred consideration",
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non—controlling interest in the acquiree and the
acquisition-date lair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value ofthe identifiable
net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. if the total of consideration transferred, nonacontrolling interest
recognised and previously held interest measured is less than the fair value of the net assets ofthe subsidiary
acquired in the case ofa bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
interacornpany transactions, baiances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are
eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated.

Bathurst Resources Limited
Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 30 June 2016
————
Joint arrangements
The group applies NZ IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements. Under NZ IFRS 11 investments in joint arrangements are
classified as eitherjoint operations orjoint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each
investor, Bathurst Resources Limited has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined them to
be joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted
thereafter to recognise the group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and movements in other
comprehensive income. When the group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interests in the
joint venture (which includes any langrterm interests that, in substance, form part ofthe group's net investment
in the joint venture], the group does not recognise further losses, except to the extent that the group has an
obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.
F. Foreign currency translation
(i) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at
the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such
transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated
in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss.
(ii) Group companies
The results and financial position of foreign operations [none of which has the currency ofa hyperinflationary
economy) that have a functional currency diﬂerent from the presentation currency are translated into the
presentation currency as follows:

I assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of
that balance sheet;

0 income and expenses for each income statement and statement of comprehensive income are
translated at montth average exchange rates lunless this is not a reasonable approximation of the
cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses
are translated at the dates of the transactions), and

- all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.

G. Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised and measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable to the extent
it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. The
following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
(1') Sale of goods
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when there is an executed sales agreement at the time of delivery
of the goods to customer, indicating that there has been a transfer of risks and rewards to the customer, no
further work or processing is required, the quantity and quality of the goods has been determined, the price is
fixed and when title has passed.
(ii) Freight income
Revenue from freight services is recognised in the accounting period in which the services are provided. Revenue
is not recognised until the service has been completed.
(iii) Interest income
Interest income is recognlsed as interest accrues using the effective interest method. This is a method of
calculating the amortlsed cost of a financial asset and allocating the interest income over the relevant period
11 E
pwc


Bathurst Resources Limited
Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 30 June 2016
———
using the effective interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through
the expected life of the financial asset to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.
H. Income tax
The income tax expense or benefit for the period is the tax payable on the current period's taxable income based
on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities
attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the
end of the reporting period in the countries where the company‘s subsidiaries and associates operate and
generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to
situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where
appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the
tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However,
deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income
tax is also not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than
a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting or taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted
by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is
realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is
probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets
and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and
tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on
a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised
in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. in this case, the tax is also recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
I, Inventories
Raw materials and stores, work in progress and finished goods are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable
value. Cost comprises direct materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of variable and fixed
overhead expenditure, the latter being allocated on the basis of normal operating capacity. Costs are assigned
to inventory on the basis of weighted average costs. Costs of purchased inventory are determined after
deducting rebates and discounts. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of
business less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
1. Financial instruments
(i) Non-derivative financial instruments
Nonaderivative financial instruments comprise trade and other receivables, cash and short term deposits, other
financial assets, deferred consideration, borrowings and other payables.
Nonaderivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus, for instruments not at fair value
through the income statement, transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition nonrderivative financial
instruments are measured as described below.
a E,
pwc


Bathurst Resources Limited
Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 30 June 2016
A ﬁnancial instrument is recognised ifthe Group becomes party to the contractual provisions ofthe instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised if the Group’s contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset
expire or if the Group transfers the financial asset to another party without retaining control of substantially all
risks and rewards of the asset. Financial liabilities are derecognised if the Group‘s obligations specified in the
contract expire or are discharged or are cancelled.
Financial assets carried at amortised cost
Loans and receivables are nonrderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not
quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than
12 months after the reporting period which are classified as nonrcurrent assets.
Management determines the classification of its investments at initial recognition,
Loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in note 10 comprise cash at bank and on hand and shorteterm deposits with an original
maturity ofthree months or less.
For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents
as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts, and excluding restricted cash deposits.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently measured at
amortlsed cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Trade receivables are
generally due for settlement within 30 days. They are presented as current assets unless collection is not
expected for more than 12 months after the reporting date.
Trade and other payables
These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of financial
year which are unpaid. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition. Trade
and other payables are presented as current liabilities unless payment is not due within 12 months from the
reporting date.
They are recognised initially at their fair value less transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised
cost using the effective interest method.
Deferred consideration
The fair value of deferred consideration payments is determined at acquisition date. Subsequent changes to
the fair value ofthe deferred consideration are recognised through the income statement. The portion of the
fairvalue adjustment due to the time value of money [unwinding ofdiscount) is recognised as a ﬁnance cost. For
further information on deferred consideration referto note 20.
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently
measured at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net oftransaction costsl and the redemption
amount is recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that
it is probable that some mail of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw
down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn
down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility
to which it relates.
13 E


Bathurst Resources Limited
Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 30 June 2016
——
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer Settlement of
the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period.
(ii) Derivative financial instruments
From time to time the Group may use derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to commodity risks
and foreign exchange risks arising from operational and financing activities. Derivatives that do not qualify for
hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
K. Impairment
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that an asset or
group of assets is impaired.
Financial assets
A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is
objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of
the asset la ’loss event’l and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the
ﬁnancial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
For loans and receivables, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been
incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss. If a loan
has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest
rate determined under the contract. As a practical expedient, the Group may measure impairment on the basis
of an instrument’s fair value using an observable market price.
Non-financial assets
For nonsfinancial assets, the recoverable amount is the higher of an asset‘s fair value less costs to sell and value
in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are
separately identifiable cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or
groups ofassets (cashrgenerating unitsl.
Exploration and evaluation assets are tested for impairment when eitherthe period ofthe exploration right has
expired or will expire in the near futurE, substantive expenditure on further exploration for and evaluation in
the specific area is neither budgeted or planned, exploration for and evaluation in the specific area have not led
to the discovery of commercially viable quantities and the Group has decided to discontinue such activities in
the area or there is sufficient data to indicate that the carrying amount of the exploration and evaluation asset
is unlikely to be recovered in full from successful development or sale.
Nonvfinancial assets other than goodwill that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the
impairment at the end of each reporting period.
L. Property, plant and equipment
All property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate,
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group.
The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset Is derecognised when replaced. All
other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the reporting period in which they are
incurred.

Depreciation is recognised in profit or loss over the estimated useful lives of each item of plant, property and
equipment. Leasehold improvements and certain leased plant and equipment are depreciated over the shorter
of the lease term and their useful lives,
The estimated useful lives for Significant items of property, plant and equipment are as follows:
7 Buildings 25 years
7 Mine infrastructure 3 — 8 years
a PlantStmachinery 2—25 years
7 Plant & machinery leased Units of use
7 Furniture, fittings and equipment 3 — 8 years
The assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each
reporting period.
An asset‘s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount ifthe asset's carrying amount
is greater than its estimated recoverable amount (note 1(kl).
Any gain or loss on disposals of an item of property, plant and equipment (calculated as the difference between
the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the item) is recognised in the proﬁt or loss.
M. Exploration and evaluation expenditure
Exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred is capitalised to the extent that the expenditure is expected to
be recovered through the successful development and exploitation of the area of interest, or the exploration
and evaluation activities in the area of interest have not yet reached a point where such an assessment can be
made. All other exploration and evaluation expenditure is expensed as incurred.
Capitalised costs are accumulated in respect of each identifiable area ofinterest. Costs are only carried forward
to the extent that tenure is current and they are expected to be recouped through the successful development
ofthe area (or, alternatively by its sale] or where activities in the area have not yet reached a stage which permits
reasonable assessment of the existence of economically recoverable reserves and operations in relation to the
area are continuing.
Accumulated costs in relation to an abandoned area are written off in full against proﬁt in the period in which
the decision to abandon the area is made.
When production commences, the accumulated costs for the relevant area of interest are amortised over the
life of the area according to the rate of depletion of the economically recoverable reserves.
A regular review is undertaken of each area of interest to determine the appropriateness of continuing to carry
forward costs in relation to that area of interest.
N. Mining and development properties
Mining and development properties include the cost of acquiring and developing mining properties, licenses,
mineral rights and exploration, evaluation and development expenditure carried forward relating to areas where
production has commenced.
These assets are amortised using the unit of production basis over the proven and probable reserves.
Amonisation starts from the date when commercial production commences.

An asset‘s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount ifthe asset's carrying amount
is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate,
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the Group and the
cost of the item can be measured reliably.
0. Waste in advance
Waste removed in advance costs incurred in the development of a mine are capitalised as parts of the costs of
constructing the mine and subsequently amortised over life of the relevant area oi interest or life of mine if
appropriate (herein referred to as "life of mine").
Waste removal normally continues through the life of the mine. The Group defers waste removal costs incurred
during the production stage of its operations and discloses it within the cost of constructing the mine.
The amount of waste removal costs deferred is based on the ratio obtained by dividing the volume of waste
removed by the tonnage of coal mined. Waste removal costs incurred in the period are deferred to the extent
that the current period ratio exceeds the life of mine ratio, Costs above the life of ore component strip ratio are
deferred to waste removed in advance. The stripping activitv asset is amortised on a units of production basis.
The life of mine ratio is based on proven and probable reserves of the operation,
Waste moved in advance costs form part of the total investment in the relevant cash generating unit, which is
reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable.
Changes to the life of mine stripping ratio are accounted for prospectivelyi
P. Provisions
Provision for rehabilitation
Provisions are made for site rehabilitation costs relating to areas disturbed during the mine‘s operation up to
reporting date but not yet rehabilitated. The provision is based on management's best estimate of future costs
of rehabilitation. When the provision is recognised, the corresponding rehabilitation costs are recognised as part
of mining property and development assets. At each reporting date, the rehabilitation liability is reameasured in
line with changes In the timing or amount of the costs to be incurred. Changes in the liability relating to
rehabilitation of mine infrastructure and dismantling obligations are added to or deducted from the related
asset.
if the change in the liability results in a decrease in the liability that exceeds the carrying amount of the asset,
the asset is written down to nil and the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement. lfthe change
in the liability results in an addition to the cost of the asset, the recoverability of the new carrying value is
considered. Where there is an indication that the new carrying amount is not fully recoverable, an impairment
test is performed with the write down recognised in the income statement in the period in which it occurs.
The net present value of the provision is calculated using an appropriate discount rate, the unwinding of the
discount applied in calculating the net present value of the provision is charged to the income statement in each
reporting period and is classified as a finance cost.
Q. Share-based payments
Share-based compensation benefits are provided to employees via the Bathurst Resources Limited Long Term
incentive Plan.
16 as


Bathurst Resources Limited
Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 30 June 2016
——
The fair value of performance rights granted under the Bathurst Resources Limited Long Term Incentive Plan is
recognised as an employee benefits expense with a corresponding increase in equity, The total amount to be
expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the rights granted, which includes any market
performance conditions and the impact ofany non-vesting conditions but excludes the impact of any service
and non-market performance vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of rights that are expected to
vest. The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified
vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each period, the Company revises its estimates ofthe number
of rights that are expected to vest based on the non»market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the
revision to original estimates, if any, in profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
R. Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the
arrangement and requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment ofthe arrangement is dependent on the use
ofa specific asset or assets and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
Finance leases, those under which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to
the company, are capitalised at the lease’s inception at the fair value of the leased property, or, if lower, the
present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are
included in other short-term and long-term payables.
capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease
term if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straightrline basis over
the lease term. Operating lease incentives are recognised as a liability when received and subsequently reduced
by allocating lease payments between rental expense and reduction of the liability.
S. Intangible assets — emissions trading units
Emissions trading units are acquired by the Group to satisfy its obligations under the New Zealand Emissions
Trading Scheme. These units have a finite useful life but are not amortised because they are expected to be
utilised to offset the Group's obligation under the Emissions Trading Scheme within 12 months of balance date.
The units are recognised at cost.
Tl Goods and Services Tax
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of goods and services tax ("GST"), except
where the GST incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authorities, in
which case the GST is recognised as part ofthe cost of acquisition ofthe asset or as part of an item ofthe expense
item as applicable Receivables and payables in the balance sheet are shown inclusive of GST.
The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables
or payables in the balance sheet, Cash flows are included in the statement of cash flows on a gross basis and
the GST component of cash flows arising from investing and financing activities, which is recoverable from, or
payable to, the taxation authority, are classified as operating cash flows.
U. Contributed equity
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Issued and paid up capital is recognised at the fair value of the
consideration received by the Company. Any transaction costs arising on the issue of ordinary shares are
recognised directly in equity as a reduction of the share proceeds received.

V. Earnings per share
(l) Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing:
- the profit attributable to owners of the Company, excluding any costs of servicing equity other than
ordinary shares
a by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the ﬁnancial year, adjusted for
bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the year.
(if) Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into
account:
0 the after income tax effect of interest and other ﬁnancing costs associated with dllutive potential
ordinary shares, and
I the weighted average number of additional ordinary shares that would have been outstanding
assuming the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary Shares
W. Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported In a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decision maker. The chiefoperating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and
assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Board of Directors.
X. New accounting standards and interpretations not yet effective
Certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been issued that are not yet
mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2015. The Group has not early adopted:
(i) NZ lFRS 9, Financial instruments, revised NZ lFRS 9 {2014): Financial Instruments and revised NZ IFRS 9
(2013): Financial Instruments.
Effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018‘ The standard adds requirements related to the
classiﬁcation, measurement and derecognition of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities,
{ii} NZ IFRS 15, Revenue from contracts with customers
Effective for periods beginning on oraiter 1 January 2018. The standard Introduces principles for reporting
cohesive and useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and
uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity's contracts with customers.
(iii) NZ IFRS 16, Leases
Effective for periods beginning on or after 1January 2019. The standard removes the classification ofleases
as either operating or finance leases — for the lessee — effectively treating all leases as finance leases.
The Group expects to adopt the above standards in the year in which they become mandatory. The Group
is assessing the potential impact on the financial statements in adopting these standards.
V. Standards and Interpretations adopted during the year
The financial information presented for the year ended 30 June 2016 has been prepared on the basis of
accounting policies and methods of computation consistent with those applied in the 30 June 2015 financial
statements contained within the 2015 Annual Report of Eathurst Resources Limited.

2. Segment information
Management has determined operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Board of Directors
that are used to make strategic decisions.
The Board reviews the business from both a mine and geographic perspective and has identiﬁed two
reportable segments. The Buller Coal segment relates to the mining, development and ultimate exploitation of
permits underthe Buller Coal management team in the Buller region of New Zealand. The Eastern Coal
segment refers to the Takitimu mine and Timaru coal handling and distribution centre under the Eastern
management team. The ﬁnancial performance of these segments is monitored and operated separately from
each other.
All other operations of the Group are classified within "Corporate" section of the segment note which
encompasses the administration and treasury management of the Group.
Revenue is not presented to the chief operating decision maker on a segmented basis, instead it is presented
as a sales function across the Group. Total revenue forthe year ended 30 June 2015 totalled $50.9m (2015:
$51.3m).
Total assets and total liabilities are reported on a group basis and are not provided internally on a segmented
basist Total assets and liabilities as at 30 June 2016 total $44.0m (30 June 2015: $50.4ml and $24.0m (30 June
2015: $31.5m) respectively.
Two Eathurst customers met the reporting threshold of 10 percent of Bathurst's operating revenue in the year
to SOJune 2016.

Management has assessed the cash generating units for the Group as follows:

0 Bathurst Domestic Coal, as the coal yard cannot generate its own cash flows independent of the mine.
aathurst Domestic Coal includes Canterbury Coal, Takitimu mine and the Timaru coal yard.

0 Buller Coal Project, as there is a large amount of shared infrastructure between the proposed mines,
necessary blending of the pit products at the same site, and the similar geographical location of the
pits.

I Cascade mine, as the mine has had established domestic markets which allow a profitable operation
without relying on the infrastructure to be built for the Buller Coal Project.

Management has prepared detailed Impairment models for each of the above cash generating units to
determine the recoverable amount which is the higher of the value in use or fair Value less cost to sell. The
model is a discounted cash flow based on the Board approved operating plans for each CGU.
Bathurst Domestic Coal
The recoverable amount of CGU future cash flows has been assessed as higher than the carrying value
therefore no impairment has been recorded as at 30 June 2016.
Buller Coal Project
The Buller Coal Project is subject to movements in the international coking coal market. Coking coal prices
have experienced a reduction in recent years which has impacted on the potential value of the Buller Coal
Project. The Buller Coal Project was fully impaired in the year ended 30 June 2015 and remains fully impaired
at 30 June 2016.
Cascade Mine
The Cascade mine was placed on care and maintenance during the period. The only remaining assets
attributable to this CGU are low levels of inventory which is held at the lower of cost and net realisahle value.
Assumptions
The sales price per tonne used in the valuation models has been based on current contractual
arrangements. Production levels have been based on the Board approved operating plan which, for the Buller
Project] reflects the current status on care and maintenance. As the majority of all production is matched to
contracted sales, the sensitivity of pricing movements for non-contracted volumes is immaterial.

(3) Details on deferred consideration — Buller Coal Project
The Company acquired Euller Coal Limited (formally LEtM Coal Limited] in November 2010 and the sale and
purchase agreement contained an element of deferred consideration. The deferred consideration comprised
cash consideration and/or royalties on coal sold.
The deferred cash consideration is made up oftwo payments of usp$40,ooo,ooo (performance payments),
the first being payable Upon 25,000 tonnes of coal being shipped from the Buller Coal Project and the second
payable upon 1 million tonnes of coal being shipped from the Buller Coal Project.
The Company has the option to defer Cash payment of the performance payments and elect to submrt a higher
royalty on coal sold from the respective permit areas. The option to pay a higher royalty rate has been
assumed in the Valuation and recognition of deferred consideration. This also reflects the current status of the
mine on care and maintenance,
The iair value of any future royalty payments is estimated using a discount rate based upon the latest New
Zealand 10 year government bond rate, sales proﬁle, and forecasted domestic coal prices.
The potential undiscounted amount ofall future cash payments that the Group could be required to make
undertnese arrangements is between nil and USD$80,000,000. The deferred cash consideration is valued at
each reporting date based on expected timing of the cash payment and an appropriate discount rate,
Reyaluations are recognised in the income statement.
Payment timing
The construction coal mined at Escarpment has triggered the first performance payment. This is not payable
as the higher royalty election has been made and royalties have been paid in the current year.
The Escarpment mine is currently on care and maintenance with low level sales expected from existing stock
piles.

Security
Pursuant to a deed ofguarantee and security the two performance payments of US$40 million included in the
deferred consideration above are secured by way of a ﬁrst—ranking security interest in all of Buller Coal
Limited’s present and future assets land present and future rights, title and interest in any assets). in addition
to this, Buller Coal Limited has guaranteed the payment of all amounts under the Sale and Purchase
Agreement with LKtM Coal Holdings Limited.
(b) Details on deferred consideration — Canterbury Coal Limited
The acquisition of Canterbury Coal Limited in November 2013 contained a royalty agreement. The amounts
that are payable in the future under this royalty agreement are required, to be recognised as part of the
consideration paid for Canterbury Coal Limited. The fair value of the future royalty payments is estimated
using a discount rate based upon the latest New Zealand 10 year government bond rate] production profile,
and forecasted domestic coal prices. A reasonable change in discount rate does not have a material impact on
the deferred consideration.
1:) Details on deferred consideration — New Brighton Collieries Limited
The Company completed the acquisition of New Brighton Collieries Limited on 10 March 2015. The balance
due on settlement is to be satisfied by an ongoing royalty based on mine gate sales revenue. The fair Value of
the future royalty payments is estimated using a discount rate based upon a risk adjusted New Zealand 10 year
government bond rate of 8.37% (2015: 5.53%), projected production profile, and forecast domestic coal prices.
A 1% increase or decrease in the discount rate used would decrease or increase the deferred consideration
balance by $0.4m and $0.5m, respectively (2015: $0.5m and $0.6m respectively).
Security
Pursuant to a deed of guarantee and security the deferred consideration is secured by way of a first—ranking
security interest in all of New Brighton Collieries Limited’s present and future assets (and present and future
rights, title and interest in any assets).
Deferred consideration liabilities have been categorised as level 3 under the fair value hierarchy.

27. Financial risk management
The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, and interest
rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's overall risk management programme focuses on the
unpredictability offinancial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial
performance of the Group.
The Group uses different methods to measure different types of risk to which it is exposed. These methods
include sensitivity analysis in the case of interest rate, foreign exchange and other price risks and aging analysis
for credit risk.
Risk management is carried out by the management team under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Management identifies and evaluates financial risks on a regular basis.
(a) Market risk
(l) Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities
denominated in a currency that is not New Zealand dollars. The risk is measured using sensitivity analysis and
cash flow forecasting.
Once the Group commences export sales, it becomes exposed to foreign exchange movements, this primarily
relates to deferred consideration which is denominated in USD for export coal sales of coal sourced from the
permits acquired from L&M Coal Holdings Limited.
The Group had minimal exposure to foreign currency risk at the end of the reporting period.
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial
loss to the Group. The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with credit worthy counterparties and
obtaining sufficient collateral where appropriate as a means of minimising the risk of financial defaults.
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Group to credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash
equivalents, short term deposits, as well as credit exposures to our customers including outstanding
receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with credit ratings of AA-, with
funds required to be invested with a range of separate counterparties.
The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk for trade and other receivables is its carrying value.
(c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk represents the Group's ability to meet its contractual obligations. The Group evaluates its
liquidity requirements on an ongoing basis.

(:1) Capital management
The Group‘s capital includes contributed equity, reserves, and retained earnings. The Board's policy IS to
maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor, and market confidence and to sustain the
future development of the business Given the stage of the Company’s development there are no formal
targets set for return on capital. There were no changes to the Company's approach to capital management
during the year. The Company is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
(e) Fair value measurements
The fair value of assets and liabilities must be estimated for recognition and measurement or for disclosure
purposes.
Fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy:
(a) Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1)
lb) inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly [as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices) (level 2), and
(6) Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable
inputs) [level 3).
The Group's only financial asset or liability measured at a fair value hierarchy of level 3 is deferred
consideration. This is discussed further in note 20.

material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern
basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no
realistic alternative but to do so,

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, as a whole,
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor‘s report that includes
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs NZ and ISAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to inﬂuence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the ﬁnancial statements is located at the External
Reporting Board’s website at:
