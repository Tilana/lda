<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council 
resolution 12/21, in which the Council requested the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights to convene, in 2010, a workshop for an exchange of views on how a 
better understanding of traditional values of humankind underpinning international human 
rights norms and standards can contribute to the promotion and protection of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms, with the participation of representatives from all interested 
States, regional organizations, national human rights institutions and civil society, as well 
as experts selected with due consideration given to the appropriate representation of 
different civilizations and legal systems and to present to the Council a summary of the 
discussions held at the workshop in conformity with the programme of work of the 
Council.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Workshop 
</b></p>
<p>2. The workshop was organized by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights  in consultation with Member States, a range of experts 
and representatives of civil society. The organization of the workshop benefited from a 
generous financial contribution from the Russian Federation. 
</p>
<p>3. The workshop was held on 4 October 2010, in the Palais des Nations, Geneva. 
Translation was provided in the six official languages of the United Nations in order to 
facilitate a broader discussion. The workshop agenda consisted of five panels: an 
introductory panel framing the discussion; a panel focusing on human dignity and equality 
as values underpinning international human rights norms; a panel devoted to the 
relationship between rights and responsibilities; a panel where opportunities and challenges 
were discussed; and a panel with concluding remarks. The workshop was well attended by 
State representatives, members of other United Nations agencies, non&#8211;governmental 
organizations, academics and experts. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Framing the issue 
</b></p>
<p>4. The workshop and introductory panel were opened by the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights.  The High Commissioner made reference to her own 
experiences of cultural diversity as a South African woman of Asian descent, and having 
embarked on a professional career that started nationally and took her to the international 
arena. Cultural diversity had showed her many human similarities: the fundamental, 
irreducible and universal values that transcend geography and know no barriers of culture 
or gender, class or language. These were the values that underpin human rights. Some of 
these values, familiar to all peoples, include the desire for liberty, dignity and freedom from 
fear and want, and form the basis of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The 
Declaration reflected the views of men and women from cultures and traditions across the 
world. 
</p>
<p>5. According to the High Commissioner, tradition is a complex notion. No society, 
regardless of its geographic location or level of economic development, can be said to be 
represented by a single and comprehensive set of shared values covering all social matters.  
Traditions and values change over time, and are viewed and interpreted differently by 
various actors in society. While there were traditions in line with human rights, others were 
in conflict with them. The aim of the workshop was to focus on the traditional values </p>


<p>underpinning human rights. Doing so meant rejecting those who would seek to juxtapose 
traditional values against human rights with a view to erode the universal authority and 
appeal of human rights. While the Vienna Declaration recognized that the significance of 
national and regional particularities and various historical, cultural and religious 
backgrounds must be borne in mind, it reaffirmed that is the duty of all States, regardless of 
their political, economic and cultural systems, to promote and protect all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms. The High Commissioner concluded that understanding the common 
normative underpinnings of both sides of that equation was important for more effective 
human rights promotion, and, ultimately, more humane societies. 
</p>
<p>6. Subsequently, a keynote address was delivered by the Executive Director of the 
United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). Her address focused on human rights in a 
cross-cultural perspective, as reflected in the work of UNFPA worldwide. She pointed out 
that, in the experience of UNFPA, to internalize human rights, cultural values and beliefs 
must be clearly identified, contested, negotiated and eventually reconciled from within. 
</p>
<p>7. The Executive Director stressed that culture mattered because cultural traditions and 
beliefs were often more strongly rooted than laws: therefore, to get to the roots of human 
rights issues, there was a need to engage at a cultural level. For instance, discrimination and 
violence against women and harmful practices such as female genital mutilation and child 
marriage were illegal in many countries, and yet they persisted because they were deeply 
rooted within the culture. Violations of human rights happened in families and 
communities while systems of justice were often at the national level, far away from the 
violations. It was the mechanisms of the local value system that recognized or ignored such 
violations. To be effective in eradicating such practices, there was a need to engage at a 
deeper level to promote human rights in the context of individuals, families and 
communities at the local level. This required listening and promoting dialogue within 
communities. 
</p>
<p>8. The Executive Director offered examples and positive results of UNFPA work 
regarding women&#8217;s health, the reduction of high rates of maternal death, the eradication of 
violence against girls and women and female genital mutilation, the prevention of HIV 
infection, and humanitarian assistance in societies suffering from emergencies, in contexts 
where traditional beliefs posed obstacles to such goals. She concluded by stressing that 
change that contributed to universal human rights in diverse cultural settings could not be 
imposed from the outside: to be lasting, it must come from within. The principles of human 
rights must be internalized by communities and individuals, and the key to this was to find 
the positive values and agents of change that exist in all cultures. Culture was created by 
people and people could change culture. They could build on the positive and transform the 
negative aspects of their culture. There were people within every culture who opposed 
harmful cultural practices and violations of human rights. International actors in the field of 
human rights must be able to view the field from cross-cultural perspectives. By doing so, 
they should be able to engage in a dialogue with cultures and mobilize cultural agents of 
change for development and human rights. 
</p>
<p>9. The President of the Paris Office of the Institute for Democracy and Cooperation, 
Natalia Narochnitskaya, commended the Human Rights Council for engaging in a 
discussion of traditional values and human rights. In her view, the protection and 
promotion of diversity and equality between nations and cultures were the prerequisites for 
genuine harmony in the relations between civilizations and within any society of our time. 
The world was interdependent but not homogenous. There was no country or civilization 
where freedoms, human rights and equality were not of major importance, but there were 
different perceptions of these issues. She recalled that the Charter of the United Nations 
combined the recognition and protection of human rights with the recognition of non-
interference in the domestic affairs of countries and their sovereign equality. She </p>


<p>encouraged the Council to conduct a study about the interpretation of human rights in 
different cultures. 
</p>
<p>10. According to Ms. Narochnitskaya, the very notion of human rights, and the idea that 
the authority of public officials was bound by legal, traditional and ethical norms could be 
found in the Greco-Christian concept of natural law and, as such, could be considered 
traditional. She observed that traditional Christian values, which underscored the value of 
human dignity, could be identified in several current human rights standards, such as the 
prohibition of slavery. At the same time, many regimes responsible for gross violations of 
human rights in the twentieth century overtly declared themselves &#8220;anti&#8211;traditional&#8221;. She 
also affirmed that the birth of both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 
European Convention on Human Rights were attempts to give new impetus to values that 
were deeply rooted in tradition. 
</p>
<p>11. Ensuring human rights required the protection, not the elimination, of traditional 
institutions such as the State, the community and the family. Attachment to traditional 
values was important to ensure that respect for human rights was based not only on fear of 
legal punishment but also on deeply grounded convictions. Tradition could be one of the 
best teachers because it influenced behaviour internally and without coercion. Ms. 
Narochnitskaya warned about the dangers of axiological nihilism and the loss of spiritual 
inclinations. She therefore advocated for a restoration of the link between human rights and 
traditional moral values. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Human dignity and equality 
</b></p>
<p>12. The second panel focused on human dignity and equality as values underpinning 
human rights, which could be traced in various traditions and cultures. The first panellist,  
Eckart Klein, law professor at the University of Potsdam, Germany, and former member of 
the Human Rights Committee, offered a thorough overview of the meaning of the concept 
of equality in human dignity in international human rights instruments. 
</p>
<p>13. Mr. Klein pointed out that universal human rights instruments did not frame human 
dignity as a separate human right, but considered that the recognition of equal and 
inalienable human rights derived from the inherent human dignity of human beings. Human 
rights instruments offered indications for the justification of this assertion: the need for the 
recognition and protection of human rights lay in the reaction against &#8220;barbarous acts which 
have outraged the conscience of mankind&#8221;. Human dignity was not defined in human rights 
instruments. Furthermore, no specific endorsement of a single philosophical, 
anthropological or religious approach was made by human rights instruments; thus, the 
recognition of human dignity stood as a founding value, without endorsement of any 
particular line of justification. 
</p>
<p>14. Mr. Klein noted the evolution of the place assigned to human dignity in relation to 
human rights. While the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 regarded human 
dignity as an undisputed value that was attributed to the human family, it was the 
Covenants of 1966 that asserted that human rights derive from human dignity. Human 
dignity could be conceived as a foundational value of human rights, and thus as a parameter 
that should guide the interpretation of legally recognized human rights. This was not a 
superfluous notion, as there was an important relationship between the legitimacy of legal 
norms and their ethical underpinnings. Moreover, foundational values could also offer 
guidance when there was a need to interpret the scope of human rights and the acceptability 
of their limitation or restriction. 
</p>
<p>15. Several conclusions flowed from the assertion of human dignity as a basis for 
human rights. Firstly, it required the recognition of human beings as right holders and right </p>


<p>claimers. Secondly, it would be incompatible with human dignity to deprive individuals or 
groups of individuals of their rights. Thirdly, human dignity was not only an individual but 
also a societal value; thus, human rights should be understood in the context of human 
interaction, and that meant a need to respect the human dignity of the others &#8211; and the 
necessary legal protection to ensure such respect. Fourthly, human dignity required the 
recognition of human freedom: to be able to develop one&#8217;s own identity. While 
international human rights law may allow for limitations or restrictions on rights, human 
dignity required that such restrictions were not arbitrary and, in some cases &#8211; such as the 
prohibition of torture and cruel or degrading treatment &#8211; that no such restrictions were 
admitted. 
</p>
<p>16. Lastly, Mr. Klein addressed the issue of the universality of human rights. The 
assertion of human dignity as a foundational value carried an immanent claim of universal 
validity. The significance of national and regional particularities and various historical 
cultural, religious and backgrounds might, however, be relevant to the interpretation of 
human rights in specific contexts, especially of the permissibility of restrictions. Human 
dignity should always, however, be a yardstick for these interpretations. Cultural traditions 
could never be a justification for State action or failure to act when human dignity was at 
stake. Mr. Klein also stressed the need to take into context the evolution of values, which 
were not fixed or immutable, when interpreting human rights in the light of human dignity. 
He advocated for both openness and carefulness when doing so. 
</p>
<p>17. The Human Rights Director of the Tukui Shimi Foundation and former member of 
the Ecuadorian Constitutional Assembly, M&#243;nica Chuji, placed the concept of human 
dignity in the context of the indigenous peoples&#8217; worldview by focusing on the notion of 
<i>sumak kawsay</i> (&#8220;good living&#8221; or &#8220;life in harmony&#8221;), which had been incorporated into the 
new Constitutions of Ecuador and Bolivia (Plurinational State of), together with 
international human rights instruments and standards. The concept of <i>sumak kawsay</i>, which 
originated in the worldview of Andean indigenous peoples, based the notion of well-being 
not in the isolated individual, but in the relationship between the individual, the community 
and nature. 
</p>
<p>18. <i>Sumak kawsay</i> meant to enjoy access to a healthy and fertile land; to cultivate what 
was necessary and in a diversified way, to keep rivers, forest, mountains and the air clean; 
to manage collectively the territory, to provide and receive an education on the basis of the 
community&#8217;s own values, to respect the rights of others, and to decide collectively on the 
priorities of each community. It was based on the respect of those who lived around us and 
of the ancestral institutions that regulated community life. It was founded on equity, 
solidarity, reciprocity, discipline, respect, the acknowledgment of difference, conservation 
and the recognition that all of us are part of nature, part of biodiversity and have the 
responsibility of looking after our habitat. 
</p>
<p>19. The concept of <i>sumak kawsay</i> had multiple dimensions. It had a 
philosophical/ethical dimension, focused on the need for an indivisible, respectful and 
harmonious relationship of individuals and communities with nature. It had a political 
dimension, linked with self-determination and the collective rights of indigenous peoples to 
decide on their own development. It had a legal dimension, because it needed to be 
reflected in binding legal norms, which included customary norms. <i>Sumak kawsay</i> was also 
connected to universally recognized human rights; indeed, it was related to civil, political, 
economic, social and cultural rights, and to both individual and collective rights. It had 
economic dimensions, because it offered a basis to assess which economic activities were 
respectful of nature and not based on the exploitation of either nature or human beings. 
<i>Sumak kawsay</i> promoted diverse, healthy and balanced production, allowing for sharing, 
consumption of own produce and fair trade. It had a cultural dimension, because it reflected 
traditional knowledge and values and was open to intercultural dialogue. It had an </p>


<p>environmental dimension, which called for the respect of biodiversity and a balanced 
relationship with nature. It had a communicational dimension, because it encompassed the 
process of conveying and transmitting knowledge and values from generation to generation 
and of articulating them with other knowledge and wisdom. In short, <i>sumak kawsay</i> aimed 
to recover the meaning and deep relationship between human being and nature, and the 
recognition and respect of the diversity of cultures and worldviews. 
</p>
<p>20. In the time reserved for comments and questions, Philip Riabykh, representing the 
Moscow Patriarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church, offered his views of the relationship 
between human rights and religious traditions. He believed that it was wrong to regard 
religious traditions as in conflict with human rights, because a religious tradition was a 
form of embodiment of universal values, including human rights, freedom and dignity, in 
the experience of a particular nation or a group of people. Mr. Riabykh warned against 
abstract determinations in the field of human rights. He stated that international authorities, 
while making human rights interpretations regarding specific countries, should make a 
thorough examination of the national context. He also underscored the fact that religious 
traditions were part of peoples&#8217; identities, and that the defamation of religion could thus 
provoke violence and conflicts. He called for an opportunity for religious organizations to 
participate in the development of human rights, and pointed to the experience of 
interreligious dialogue as an example to be followed.  
</p>
<p>21. The representative of Cuba pointed out that, since every legal system drew on 
customs and traditions, it was essential that traditions and the realities of peoples be taken 
into account. Human rights had evolved, for example, through the gradual recognition of 
new rights that were not considered before, such as the right to peace and international 
solidarity and the right to a healthy environment. Such rights should also be seen as closely 
linked with human dignity. 
</p>
<p>22. The representative of Ireland stated that the core international human rights 
instruments represented an international consensus on what humankind valued: each 
individual being able to live a life in dignity by being treated equally, free from 
discrimination of any kind. While values were partly influenced by tradition, tradition itself 
could not be taken as justification for the perpetration of human rights abuses. Indeed, 
daring to break with tradition in some instances had made a valuable difference: for 
example, by allowing the enjoyment of human rights by women who may otherwise not 
have a chance to take public office or vote, by allowing interracial and interreligious 
marriages or by granting protection to children who may otherwise be abused by adults. 
Human rights must not be confined to the bounds of tradition, but rather must remain 
relevant and therefore applicable to all individuals. 
</p>
<p>23. Also raised by participants were issues such as the compatibility of human rights 
and the death penalty and cultural assimilation and religious discrimination suffered by 
indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Freedom and responsibility through the prism of different cultures and 
traditions 
</b></p>
<p>24. The next panel focused on how different cultures conceive the links between rights 
and responsibilities as an underlying issue for the universality of human rights. 
</p>
<p>25. Joseph Prabhu, professor at the Philosophy Department of the California State 
University, United States of America, recalled Mahatma Gandhi&#8217;s reply to the inquiries 
from the study of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO) on the then prospective Universal Declaration of Human Rights. According to 
Gandhi, if human rights had the pretence of being a universal moral language of the human </p>


<p>community, rights and duties should be inextricably linked. According to Mr. Prabhu, 
Ghandi&#8217;s point shows that the universality of human rights might be conceived in many 
different ways. He therefore stressed that, in order to avoid imposing a particular 
ethnocentric standard on the rest of the world, there was a need to engage in intercultural 
dialogue. Through such a dialogue, different ideas could correct and enhance each other. 
</p>
<p>26. Mr. Prabhu advocated a model that attempted neither to transcend cultural 
differences nor to solve them by making one culture superior to others, but rather to take 
the other cultures seriously and attempt an open-minded, meaning-and-truth-seeking 
dialogue. A tripartite distinction between norms, legal mechanisms and justification could 
provide the framework within which cross-cultural dialogue proceeded. It allowed for the 
recognition and acceptance of the fact that there were many human rights cultures around 
the world, even if not necessarily using those terms; for instance, he pointed out the 
classical Indian moral notion of <i>dharma</i>, which had been invoked in discussions on human 
rights. <i>Dharma</i> did not start with the individual: human reality was not incarnated in the 
individual only but in the social whole, and the social whole in turn was an expression of a 
cosmic order whose integrity <i>dharma</i> tried to protect. From such a perspective, many of the 
assumptions underlying Western human rights discourse could be disputed. In addition to a 
critique of individualism, the tradition of <i>dharma</i> would also criticize the idea of rights 
being separated from responsibilities and the idea of rights applying to humans alone, 
leaving aside nature and the community. </p>
<p>27. Mr. Prabhu suggested that each tradition might have something to contribute to the 
development of a global human rights culture. The further evolution of human rights 
discourse needed to go beyond the limits of what he saw as its original Western-oriented 
formulation, and should consider different interlocutors, such as civil society organizations, 
and non&#8211;State spaces. </p>
<p>28. Patrice Meyer&#8211;Bisch, coordinator of the Interdisciplinary Institute for Ethics and 
Human Rights at the University of Fribourg, Switzerland, pointed out that the consideration 
of &#8220;traditional values&#8221; in the context of human rights raised two main questions: (a) was 
diversity of values compatible with universality?; and (b) was taking traditions into account 
compatible with personal freedoms? 
</p>
<p>29. According to Mr. Meyer&#8211;Bisch, it was not possible to consider human rights 
independently of their cultural context. This did not mean to introduce relativism, but to 
find in cultural diversity the array of necessary resources to reach a more concrete and 
demanding universality. Universality was the common challenge: it revealed the human 
condition by constantly working on our common contradictions. Universality was therefore 
not opposed to diversity, but channelled it and built its coherence. </p>
<p>30. Freedoms needed cultural resources to be exercises. The analysis of the traditional 
transmission of values in the light of human rights &#8211; especially cultural rights that 
particularly secured the rights and freedoms to have access to cultural resources, as vehicles 
to convey identities, values and meanings &#8211; placed on each human being duties of 
observation, interpretation and solidarity. He argued for the need (a) to inform freedoms 
with all the sources of reason; (b) to regard traditions as cultural heritages, as an object of 
cultural rights in the indivisible and interdependent human rights&#8217; system; (c) to highlight 
the importance of the responsibilities needed in order to protect the fragile value of 
traditions; and (d) to reconcile tradition and innovation, and to regard them jointly as 
common responsibilities and obligations. </p>
<p>31. Informing freedoms with all the resources of reason required ensuring access to 
cultural resources for all, especially for the most deprived, and acknowledging that 
traditions had a variety of interpretations. A living tradition was a space of constant 
interpretation and transmission. Both long-lived experience (tradition) and rational debate </p>


<p>were sources necessary to examine and convey values and reminds all that human rights 
were themselves a cross-cutting tradition. </p>
<p>32. Traditions could be considered a cultural heritage, cultural references that allowed 
human beings to identify with them, individually and in common, and to communicate with 
each other. As such, traditions must be approached with respect, but also with a critical 
attitude, given that they were not immutable. This &#8220;critical respect&#8221; towards tradition was 
the responsibility of all those who shared this reference. 
</p>
<p>33. Mr. Meyer&#8211;Bisch pointed out that the three elements building the scope of human 
rights comprised in article 1 of the Universal Declaration &#8211; freedom, equality in dignity and 
solidarity &#8211; corresponded to some fundamental capacities: of reason and conscience, of 
freedom and of responsibility. While dignity was always of individuals, it was difficult to 
conceive of it without collective references and modes of transmission, such as families, 
communities, heritage, schools and the media. 
</p>
<p>34. Regarding the relationship between tradition and innovation, Mr. Meyer&#8211;Bisch 
stressed that the development of cultural assets required conditions to allow excellence, 
valorization and creation. Cultural poverty could be defined as the failure of persons or 
communities to have access to those cultural resources that are necessary for their identity, 
freedoms, responsibilities and social ties. Prejudicial practices violating human rights and 
human dignity could be seen as indicators of cultural impoverishment, and it was the 
common responsibility of all to criticize them. This process could serve simultaneously as a 
respectful critique of traditional values and for the restoration of the dignity of persons and 
communities. Lastly, Mr. Meyer-Bisch suggested that intercultural dialogue may be 
insufficient to critically reflect on controversial issues and difficulties. Instead, he 
underscored the importance of intercultural debate as a means to benefit from the diversity 
of resources of our common reason. </p>
<p>35. After the interventions by the experts, several non-governmental organizations and 
State representatives made comments. According to the International Commission of 
Jurists, the international human rights legal framework had been established to ensure that 
human rights were guaranteed for all human beings everywhere, regardless of whether they 
belonged to a particular religion or none at all. The content of human rights must thus be 
determined not in reference to tradition or religion, but to international law as it was 
interpreted by legal authority and evolved over time. The world&#8217;s multiple and multifaceted 
traditions, cultures and religions offered us many positive and humanistic values and 
practices. However, some traditions, cultures or religions were not shared by everyone. 
International human rights law acknowledged the diversity of the human family and the 
unique nature of every individual through the principles of dignity, universality, non-
discrimination and equality before the law.  It sought to protect the individual from harmful 
practices, violence and discrimination whether or not the perpetrators invoked tradition, 
culture or religion as justifications. 
</p>
<p>36. The Youth Coalition for Sexual and Reproductive Rights drew attention to the fact 
that traditional values, such as those surrounding gender, age, disability, race, caste and 
sexuality, had led to the marginalization of numerous individuals and groups of persons. 
Examples of human rights violations and abuses included the murder of young women and 
men who married outside their caste, the denial of contraception to young unmarried people 
in public health services, the denial of comprehensive sexuality education in public schools 
and violence against lesbians and gays. 
</p>
<p>37. The Russian Civic Chamber underscored the fact that some universal human rights 
did not necessarily fit in with local traditions. For example, the idea of &#8220;privacy&#8221; was not 
always easy to translate. In many regions of the Russian Federation, there was a prevalence 
of communal values over individual values. Some values were the main guarantee of </p>


<p>human rights, such as the rule of law and the principle of justice. These were not always 
national values or State traditions.  
</p>
<p>38. The International Service for Human Rights warned about giving legitimacy to a 
system of values that was not consonant with international human rights norms and thus 
provided justification for attacks against those who defended human rights. It referred to 
the attacks suffered by women human rights defenders when perceived as defying 
traditional cultural, religious or social norms relating to women&#8217;s role in society. 
</p>
<p>39. The Global Campaign to Stop Killing and Stoning Women warned against the 
misuse of culture to condone violations of human rights. Violations were often justified 
with reference to traditional values and practices that had the effect of subjugating women 
and girls and abusing their fundamental human rights. The organization sought to end cruel 
punishment of women caused when &#8220;traditions&#8221; judged them for having transgressed the 
&#8220;traditional norms&#8221;, especially those aimed at regulating or controlling their behaviour and 
sexuality, such as laws that regulated obedience, &#8220;modesty&#8221; and freedom of mobility, and 
required a woman&#8217;s submission to the men in her family or considered women and girls to 
be the property of their fathers or husbands. The organization affirmed that the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights was not only a common standard of achievement for all 
peoples and all nations, but also a common standard of assessment for all traditional values.  
The Declaration was the embodiment of positive traditional values that were universally 
held by the community of nations and were consistent with the fundamental dignity of all 
human beings. 
</p>
<p>40. The representative of the Netherlands stated that individuals had multiple identities: 
their religion, their nationality, their professional status. This brought different value 
systems with it, and one of the functions of human rights was to protect each individual and 
to give individuals the opportunity to choose between those identities or to combine them. 
Human rights were a way of protecting the liberty of the individual to choose his or her 
own identity. To narrow down the discussion to religious traditions simplified the question 
and made a caricature out of the individual. 
</p>
<p>41. According to the Foundation for Gaia, cultural rights were not only individual or 
collective, but could also be conceived as the rights of future generations. Colonialism had 
often broken up regional cultures, and they had now become minority cultures in newly 
created nation States.  The organization considered that one could talk about transboundary 
cultures, and asked whether it was possible to conceive of transboundary cultural rights. </p>
<p>42. The delegate from the United States of America stated that the broad concept of 
&#8220;traditional values&#8221; remained a troubling one. The notion of &#8220;traditional values&#8221;, which 
was alien to human rights law, could undermine the universal principles enshrined in the 
international human rights instruments, such as women&#8217;s rights and the rights of minorities 
and other vulnerable groups. The term &#8220;traditional values&#8221; has not been clearly defined and 
understood, and was therefore so vague and open-ended that it could be used to legitimize 
human rights abuses. The inherent nature of tradition was that it evolved: what was 
considered to be traditional was constantly being contested and redefined. Slavery and the 
disenfranchisement of women were once traditions; today, most countries embraced very 
different traditions with regard to racial minorities and women. The idea of traditional 
values had been misused by some to justify restrictive and unjust treatment of lesbian, gay, 
bisexual or transsexual communities. The United States would continue to collaborate to 
reinforce universal human rights standards, and opposed the distortion of traditional values 
to support the imposition by States of discriminatory and repressive laws and policies.     
</p>
<p>43. The Russian Academy of Science pointed out that the problem of the universality of 
human rights could not be solved in an a priori manner, independently from experience, but 
a dialogue should be built and articulated. </p>


<p><b> D. Opportunities and challenges: practical approaches 
</b></p>
<p>44. The panel was devoted to a discussion of opportunities and challenges for the 
implementation of human rights in a culturally diverse world. 
</p>
<p>45. Tom Zwart, law professor at the University of Utrecht, the Netherlands, focused on 
the perspective of the &#8220;receptor theory&#8221; as a practical approach to promote the 
implementation of international human rights standards in local contexts. According to the 
approach, international human rights norms and local cultural practices could and should 
mutually reinforce each other.  
</p>
<p>46. Mr. Zwart challenged the misconception that international human rights norms 
required States to embrace Western values. Adherence to human rights did not necessarily 
require ascribing to a Western liberal conception of human rights or considering it to be 
superior to other conceptions. The international human rights regime was binding on States, 
not because this was prescribed by a particular philosophy but because it was grounded in 
positive law: the obligations of States in the area of human rights were legal commitments 
that resulted from the treaties they had signed up to rather than moral ones. All State 
parties, regardless of their philosophical views on human rights, had to live up to the 
human rights obligations to which they had committed. To the extent this legal regime 
allowed them, they could remain loyal to their own philosophical convictions. 
</p>
<p>47. Mr. Zwart referred to the assumption that, in order to implement international 
human rights obligations, States had no other option than to turn them into enforceable 
rights within their domestic sphere. He maintained that, unless indicated otherwise, States 
were free to choose their own social arrangements to implement international human rights 
obligations. Under international law, States enjoyed discretion with regard to the 
implementation of treaty obligations within the national order. As long as they met the 
obligations laid down in the respective treaties, they may choose the most appropriate way 
of doing so at the domestic level, including through the arrangements that already existed 
when the State signed up to the treaty. Therefore, non-western States can implement treaty 
obligations without using rights, but by relying on other social arrangements that fit better 
into their culture and traditions, as long as they meet the standards laid down in the treaties.  
In these cultures, human rights treaty obligations were pursued through other, non-legal 
means, such as kinship, group solidarity, respect, restraint, duties and beliefs. 
</p>
<p>48. Mr. Zwart then outlined the &#8220;receptor theory&#8221;, which assumed that States could and 
should rely on local cultural practices to implement international human rights obligations. 
The receptor approach consisted of three elements: legitimacy; cultural fluidity; and 
indigenous reform. 
</p>
<p>49. Legitimacy consisted of respect for and acknowledgement of the equality of every 
culture. The receptor approach accepted the legitimacy of implementing treaty obligations 
by putting in place social arrangements, including traditional ones, other than law and 
rights. The assumption was that, like rational-secular value systems, traditional systems 
were aimed at achieving fairness and human dignity. Cultural fluidity meant making these 
social arrangements visible. By acquiring these insights, those applying the receptor 
approach could assist in mapping the way in which State parties met their treaty obligations 
through local social arrangements. Academics, policymakers, activists and international 
monitoring bodies could therefore get a better picture of the efforts being made to 
implement human rights treaty obligations. Indigenous reform required mapping the social 
institutions that were in place to meet human rights obligations to guide those who believed 
that human rights required local reform. The receptor approach was based on the idea that 
reforms should add to but not replace existing social arrangements. It opposed the 
introduction of foreign notions into customary law if local remedies could be found which, </p>


<p>while undoing the violation, remained loyal to the social relations existing in that particular 
society. Changes that added to the existing arrangements stood a far better chance of being 
supported and carried out by the community than those that were enforced top-down. 
</p>
<p>50. Lastly, Mr. Zwart announced the creation of a network on traditional values and 
human rights, comprising academic institutions, civil society organizations and other 
stakeholders, with the aim of exploring the relationship between traditional values and 
human rights and suggesting ideas and concepts that could lead to cross-fertilization 
between them. 
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, 
Rashida Manjoo, offered an overview on how her mandate had addressed the issue of the 
intersections between traditional and cultural practices and violence against women. The 
mandate had produced two thematic reports dedicated to this issue, specifically on cultural 
practices in the family that are violent towards women and intersections between culture 
and violence against women, and had also addressed it in other reports and communications 
to Governments. 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur stated that, despite the clear provisions in many human 
rights instruments, the persistence of practices justified in the name of culture, which 
violated women&#8217;s human rights and were contrary to human dignity, was the norm. 
Widespread impunity was explained by the fact that, in the past, neither the Governments 
concerned nor the international community challenged the implications of practices that 
violated the rights to health, life, dignity and personal integrity. These were sometimes 
regarded as sensitive cultural issues falling within the private sphere of women and the 
family and thus not the business of the State. 
</p>
<p>53. In order to counter and transform culture-based discourses that hindered the 
implementation of women&#8217;s human rights, it was necessary to (a) interrogate culture as 
historically constructed and representing diverse positions and interests; (b) apply a 
political-economy perspective to understanding cultural practices; and (c) approach all 
forms of violence against women as a continuum and intersectional with other forms of 
inequality. This required ensuring that diverse women&#8217;s voices within specific communities 
were heard, and that the claim for a right to a life free from all forms of violence was not 
sacrificed in the name of culture. 
</p>
<p>54. The mandate had documented a number of culturally derived forms of violence 
against women within the family. Such practices included early and forced marriages, son 
preference, honour killings, female genital mutilation and practices that violated women&#8217;s 
sexual and reproductive rights. It had also explored the linkages between certain harmful 
practices and the contraction and transmission of HIV/AIDS. 
</p>
<p>55. The mandate had distinguished between practices that amounted to torture from 
those that amounted to discrimination. Cultural practices that involved pain and suffering 
and violation of physical integrity could amount to torture under international law. With 
regard to discriminatory practices such as unequal family law systems, the mandate had 
advocated for a range of approaches adopted by different countries to respond to the 
diversity of contexts, which should ultimately aim at changes in attitude so that social 
transformation could be led by the community itself. 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s next thematic report to be submitted to the Human Rights 
Council would be devoted to the topic of intersectional and multiple forms of 
discrimination in the context of violence against women. In the report, she would address, 
among others, the way in which oppressive practices towards women in the name of culture 
intersected with other forms of discrimination and contributed to the continuum of violence 
that women experienced. </p>


<p>57. In the space reserved for questions and comments, the Marangopoulos Foundation 
for Human Rights reminded participants of the engagement that States undertook in the 
Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action to eradicate &#8220;any conflicts which may arise 
between the rights of women and the harmful effects of certain traditional or customary 
practices&#8221;.  While the Foundation supported the need to understand the traditional values 
underpinning human rights, it pointed out that the advancement of &#8220;traditional values&#8221; may 
have a certain negative effect on the campaign against such practices as sexual abuse of 
female children in the household, dowry-related violence and female genital mutilation. It 
urged the Human Rights Council to adopt a resolution in which it reminded States of their 
international obligations to address effectively all traditional practices resulting in 
violations of women&#8217;s rights, making it clear that traditional values may not be invoked to 
justify human rights violations and advancing only those values that are consistent with 
individual human rights law. 
</p>
<p>58. ARC International expressed concern at the potential of an approach based on 
traditional values to erode international human rights standards, and at attempts to portray 
tradition as static and monolithic. Traditional values were invoked to justify past practice or 
resist change, whereas human rights frequently required changes to ensure conformity with 
international standards. It pointed out that tradition and culture were pluralistic and 
evolving and that, while some traditions were consistent with international human rights 
law, others were not. Tradition could not be seen as simply a reflection of the values of the 
majority. Much of international human rights law was designed to protect minorities that 
had been historically marginalized and subjected to abuses by the State or by the majority. 
States had a positive obligation to eradicate harmful stereotypes, values, traditions and 
practices that were inconsistent with international human rights law. Tradition and culture 
may be useful to help promote respect for human rights in our diverse societies by way of 
human rights education at the national level, but no one could invoke traditional values to 
justify human rights violations or to restrict the scope of human rights. Given the potential 
for abuse of an approach based on traditional values, it suggested that it would be more 
productive in future to refer to &#8220;universal values&#8221; or &#8220;values underpinning international 
human rights law&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>59. Human Rights Watch pointed out that the discussion on traditional values should be 
firmly embedded in the implementation of human rights obligations. It stressed that all 
cultures contained diverse and sometimes clashing traditions and values. In this sense, it 
recalled that harmful practices were often justified by invoking certain traditional values. It 
also underscored the fact that there was no clear line separating traditional values, 
traditional practices and traditional symbols. Such a lack of clear definitions made it 
difficult to assess their respective impact on human rights. In any case, in cases of human 
rights violations, human rights must supersede tradition. Currently recognized human 
rights, such as the universal right to vote, including for women, would not long ago have 
been seen as in contradiction with traditional values. Finally, those excluded from defining 
traditions were often the first victims and they should be heard in the discussion. 
</p>
<p>60. Belgium, speaking on behalf of the European Union, recalled that the European 
Union had voted against the resolution that allowed for the organization of the workshop 
because the notion of &#8220;traditional values&#8221; had a negative connotation and was subject to 
broad interpretation. This undefined concept might weaken the principles enshrined in 
international human rights instruments. Cultural diversity should be taken as an opportunity 
to promote human rights, not as an instrument to undermine them. When traditional values 
enriched human rights, they deserved protection under human rights law, as was the case 
with cultural rights and indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. More generally, traditions and values 
underpinning them were enriching factors for humanity, and were already protected as 
culture heritage by a number of UNESCO instruments. The absence of a universal 
definition of the non-legal concept of &#8220;traditional values&#8221; made it difficult to articulate </p>


<p>them in the language of human rights. The European Union recalled its attachment to the 
universality of human rights; according to the Vienna Declaration and other instruments, no 
tradition could justify violations or limitations of human rights. As far as the positive 
dimension of traditional values that could be accommodated in the framework of the 
protection and promotion of human rights was concerned, it was already taken into account 
in international law, mainly through those instruments regarding culture, cultural diversity 
and cultural heritage. While some of these aspects fell under the competence of UNESCO, 
the independent expert in the field of cultural rights could also address them in the context 
of her mandate.  
</p>
<p>61. The representative of China stated that the concept of human rights should not be 
monopolized by a few countries, and that it was actually deeply rooted in the traditional 
value system of every country. China used the traditional value system to promote the 
development of the notion of human rights; for example, traditional Chinese religious 
thought emphasized that heaven gave birth to many things, but the most important was the 
human being. Therefore promoting such a traditional value had a positive effect on the 
development of human rights. According to China, the universality of human rights should 
be combined with the traditional values of countries. 
</p>
<p>62. The Human Rights Law Resource Center pointed out that many traditional values 
were already protected by human rights law, such as freedom of religion, freedom of 
expression and freedom of association. These were, however, not absolute rights. The 
unspoken claim of many asserting traditional values is that, in cases of conflict, traditional 
values trumped other rights. This was not, however, the position of international human 
rights law. To allow the automatic prioritization of religious and cultural rights over other 
human rights perpetuated a false hierarchy of rights and might entrench systemic 
discrimination and other violations of rights. There was therefore a danger in confusing the 
recognition of cultural or religious rights with the prioritization of those rights, to the 
detriment of other rights. 
</p>
<p>63. The representative of Egypt pointed out that it was necessary to differentiate 
between what constituted tradition and what constituted values that were traditional. 
Societies were always in motion and change; the process of adaptation of what was viewed 
as human rights norms and principles as they stood, and what was regarded as traditional 
values in the positive sense, also changed, because values were part of what constituted 
society. Traditional values should not be confused with traditions or practices that were 
harmful; these had to be fought within the values upon which societies were built.   
</p>
<p>64. The representative of the Netherlands doubted that all traditional values were by 
definition conducive to the promotion of respect, protection and enjoyment of human 
rights. The lack of a clear differentiation between harmful traditional practices and 
traditional values would make it difficult to give legal sense to these notions. The 
Netherlands attached great importance to the universality of all human rights: for example, 
the protection against torture or extrajudicial killings and of other human rights should be 
the same everywhere in the world. According to article 5 of the Vienna Declaration, while 
the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical, cultural and 
religious backgrounds must be born in mind, is was the duty of States, regardless of their 
political, economic or cultural system, to promote and protect all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms. </p>


<p><b> E. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>The independent expert in the field of cultural rights, Farida Shaheed, made 
some concluding remarks on the basis of the discussions that had taken during the 
workshop. She identified some of the basic agreements in the various presentations: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) All cultures shared a common set of values that belonged to humankind 
in its entirety, and those values had made an important contribution to the 
development of human rights norms and standards; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Such values were inscribed in the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights  that, having incorporated diverse, cultural and political traditions and 
perspectives and having been adopted by consensus, &#8220;represents a common standard 
of achievement for all peoples and all nations&#8221;; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Each and every person, regardless of socio-economic, cultural and 
personal identity, belief system, political view or physical location was entitled to all 
the rights and freedoms recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) All human rights were universal, indivisible, interrelated, 
interdependent and mutually reinforcing and must be treated in a fair and equal 
manner and on the same footing; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Under international law, all States, regardless of their political, economic 
and cultural systems, had the obligation to promote and protect all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms for all. 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>Even if there was agreement on the universality of human rights, discussions on 
traditional values tended to focus on how the universality of rights was translated into 
reality. All human thinking and reasoning was rooted in people&#8217;s cultural perspectives 
and understandings, including the traditions of elaborating the contents of human 
rights. Therefore, to breathe life into international human rights standards, there 
must be ownership of these norms and standards among all communities of the world. 
This implied an acceptance and assimilation of concepts through local lexicons. 
Equally, however, the continuing development of universal human rights standards 
was only possible if this was informed by the cultural diversity of the world&#8217;s peoples. 
The interplay between universal standards and understanding and diverse localized 
realities raised a series of questions that had to be considered. To what extent were 
cultural notions and value systems in accordance with international human rights? 
Did international human rights reflect the cultural diversity of the world&#8217;s people? 
And if not, how were we to achieve harmony and a common understanding and 
therefore, make human rights a living reality? To what extent was it possible to 
distinguish between traditional values and traditional practices, which are the 
external, visible manifestations of such values? Was there a common understanding of 
what, in practical terms, constituted &#8220;traditional values&#8221;? Who was or should be 
responsible for defining the parameters and contents of &#8220;traditional values&#8221;? 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>It was essential to unpack the terms &#8220;tradition&#8221; and &#8220;traditional&#8221;, because of 
the emotive quality and resonance tradition had with cultural identity and the sense of 
self. Communities had divergent traditions that reflected different values within 
themselves, by reflecting the views of the majority and/or power-holders on the one 
hand, and those of the more marginalized, including minorities, on the other. 
Traditions constantly changed and evolved over time in response to changing realities 
and as a consequence of interactions and interchanges with other communities. 
Cultural notions and value systems drew upon both continuity with the past and a 
projected, imagined future. </b></p>


<p>68. <b>Dialogues must enable learning as a two-way process in order to facilitate a 
cross-fertilization of ideas. It was equally important to acknowledge that real 
differences in perspectives linked to traditional values could present serious 
challenges. Human dignity lay at the core of human rights. While concepts of human 
dignity were found in every society and were tied to value systems, ways of living 
together and beliefs that came together in &#8220;culture&#8221;, it was equally necessary to 
recognize that some practices and attitudes at odds with human dignity also derived 
from traditional values. Attitudes of cultural communities towards particular 
individuals because of some distinctive characteristic or trait that they possessed 
could be hugely problematic, denying the human worth of such individuals who were 
treated without dignity and, sometimes, may even be deprived of life. It was essential 
to maintain and uphold the right of every individual to accept or challenge tradition, 
for human rights meant ensuring human dignity as well as equality of all and respect 
for each person, regardless of any attribute or characteristic. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>Intercultural dialogue based on the equal respect for the world&#8217;s cultures and 
the protection and promotion of human rights allowed genuine exchanges and was the 
most valuable tool for enhancing harmony and bridging the gap between the abstract 
principles of universalism and concrete divergent particularities. Dialogue must take 
place among and within cultural traditions. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>Lastly, there was a danger in making something as undefined and constantly 
evolving as &#8220;traditional values&#8221; the standard for human rights. While drawing upon 
the richness of cultural diversity, all societies must continuously reinforce the 
promotion and protection of human dignity and the worth of all members of society 
through the norms and standards of human rights as developed and accepted by the 
international community. Positive values existed in all cultures, but there was a need 
to support communities to examine, contest, negotiate and reconcile their values and 
practices with human rights.
