CHAIRMAN’S MESSAGE FOR 2016 ANNUAL REPORT
On  behalf  of  the  Board  I  present  to  you  the  Annual  report  of  your  company,  Bass  Strait  Oil  Company, 
(Bass) for the year ended 30 June 2016.  
 
This year has seen a continuation of the challenging market conditions for all companies in the oil and gas 
sector.  The Board of Bass has continued the work to identify the value potential in its property holdings 
whilst testing the interest in these permits from the farm out market.   
 
Concurrently,  Bass  has  continued  to  review  new  business  opportunities  to  re-balance  its  portfolio  to 
introduce producing properties or properties in a development phase nearing production. 
 
Bass  is  grateful  for  the  support  of  existing  shareholders  during  is  recent  fully  underwritten  non 
renounceable rights issue where the Company raised $480,000 with over 90% of the funds raised being 
courtesy of the existing shareholder base. 
 
This  funding  will  allow  Bass  to  identify  and  move  on  securing  the  appropriate  lower  risk,  lower  growth 
business opportunities to reposition the Company for its future growth. 
 
Bass has successfully taken prudent steps to reduce its cost base to stretch its valuable cash resources 
further as we position the Company to take advantage of the next growth cycle in our industry. 
 
Finally,  I  wish  to  thank  shareholders  for  their  ongoing  support  and  my  fellow  directors  for  their  diligent 
attention to the affairs of your Company through these challenging times.

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR’S REPORT 
 
Overview 
 
The  business  environment  for  our  industry  during  the  2016  Financial  has  seen  a  continuation  of  the  challenging 
circumstances experienced from FY2015.   
 
The Company recorded an operating loss after income tax of $4,030,740 for the year ended 30 June 2016. That loss 
was driven by a write down of the carrying value of the Vic/P41 permit in the Gippsland basin by $3,421,325.  The 
write down, following the completion of a detailed technical review of the potential of Bass‟ Gippsland basin permits, 
reflects a downgrade of the Golden Beach play that was the focus of much of the early work in the Vic/P41 permit.  
The  technical  review  also  identified  a  new  material  gas  exp0loration  play  in  the  Emperor  formation  which  is 
discussed in more detail below.  
 
The  industry  and  the  energy  sector  of  capital  markets  continue  the  secular  downturn  that  began  almost  two years 
ago.  Recently  however  we  have  seen  what  may  be  the  commencement  of  a  recovery  in  our  sector.  There  are  an 
increasing number of acquisition opportunities at realistic prices that are presenting themselves in this market.  Our 
objective  is  to  position  Bass  to  take  advantage  of  any  recovery  to  the  fullest  extent  possible  by  securing  the  right 
acquisition opportunities to build an appropriate portfolio of assets that will secure the Company‟s future growth. 
   
The Company, with the overwhelming support of its shareholders, has been able to weather the storm and continue 
to  examine  opportunities  to  position  the  company  for  growth  within  its  existing  portfolio  and  seeking  out  new 
business opportunities.  Highlights for the year were:




The  Company  recently  successfully  raised  $434,397  (net  of  costs)  via  a  fully  underwritten  non-
renounceable rights issue which was strongly supported by existing shareholders. 
The  Company  completed  a  technical  review  of  the  potential  for  its  Gippsland  Basin  permits  identifying  a 
significant and material gas play in the Emperor Foundation.  
The Company applied for a work program variation for its 100% owned Vic/P68 permit to allow further work 
to be undertaken to refine the prospectivity in its core Gippsland basin permits. 
The Company continued its focused and rigorous review of new business opportunities.
Corporate Strategy 
 
The  Company  continues  a  rigorous  search  to  identify  onshore  oil  and  gas  growth  opportunities  in  Australia  and 
adjacent  neighbours.  In  this  market  there  are  increasing  numbers  of valuable producing properties being listed for 
divestment  by  companies  wishing  to  rationalise  their  portfolios.  A  number  of  opportunities  are  under  review  and 
active consideration. Once any of these meet the Company‟s investment criteria they will be progressed through an 
acquisition process.   
 
Concurrently  Bass  is  seeking  to  realise  value  from  its  current  portfolio  of  assets  by  technical  studies  aimed  at 
identifying new exciting exploration opportunities that are of interest to companies seeking an entry to the east coast 
gas market via the Gippsland basin. 
 
Exploration Projects 
 
An update of the exploration activities in each of our permits is as follows:
GIPPSLAND BASIN OFFSHORE 
 
Bass is the holder of interests in two adjacent exploration permits offshore in the Gippsland basin. The two permits, 
Vic/P41 and Vic/P68 are located approximately 40 kilometers south of the Victorian coast line. Both permits lie on an 
easterly extension of proven producing trends. 
 
These permits provide Bass exposure to the valuable East coast gas markets at a time where the demand for gas in 
this  market  is  experiencing  a  „once  in  a  generation‟  step  change  increase  in  demand  due  to  the  construction  and 
commissioning of the LNG plants in north Queensland.   
 
In  late  2015  the  technical  review  of  the  potential  of  the  Company‟s  Gippsland  basin  permits  was  completed.  The 
review identified a significant and material gas play in the Emperor Formation which is similar in characteristic and 
on trend with the Longtom gas field. The review also identified significant upside in Bass‟ 100% owned Leatherjacket 
Oil Discovery and a number of possible oil targets on trend with Leatherjacket.  In summary the key findings of the 
review were:
  Gross  prospective  gas  resources  of  over  1.75  TCF  identified  in  Emperor  Formation  (unrisked  Best
Estimate)

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR’S REPORT (CONTINUED)

Leatherjacket Oil Discovery estimates net unrisked 2C Contingent Resources of 8 million barrels of oil
During  the  year  the  Company  has  maintained  a  data  room  for  parties  interested  in  farming  into  the  Company‟s 
Gippsland  basin  portfolio.  The  current  depressed  state  of  the  farmout  market  has  subdued  interest  for  exploration 
transactions. The Company continues to market the opportunities and will advise on progress as appropriate.    
 
Contingent and Prospective Resources 
 
Note:  Contingent and prospective resources referred to in this document were announced to the ASX 28 October 
2015.  The  data  herein  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  information  provided  on  the  calculation  of  the 
contingent  and  prospective  resources  provided  in  that  ASX  release.  Bass  Strait  Oil  Company  is  not  aware  of  any 
new information or data that materially affects the information provided in that release and all material assumptions 
and technical parameters underpinning the assessment provided in the announcement continues to apply.  
 
Vic/P68: BAS 100% and Operator 
 
Exploration permit Vic/P68 lies to the west of Vic/P41 in the offshore Gippsland Basin with water depths increasing 
from 50 to 150 metres towards the southeast. This block comprises 1074 km2 and contains two primary play trends; 
the Rosedale Fault Trend and the Lake Wellington Fault Trend.  The leads and prospects from the technical review 
completed this year are displayed in Figure 1 below.    
 
In May 2016 Bass applied to the National Offshore Petroleum Administrator (NOPTA) for a work program variation 
for its 100% owned Vic/P68. The variation sought  is to replace the 225 square km 3D seismic acquisition program 
targeting  the  permit‟s  oil  potential  with  advanced  geo-scientific  studies  focusing  on  the  permit‟s  gas  potential.  The 
new  proposal  will  aim  to  enhance  the  gas  potential  in  the  permit  by  employing  advanced  QI  seismic  reprocessing 
techniques  utilising  existing  3D  seismic  data  by  tying  in  the  Longtom  field  to  the  gas  prospects  in  the  Vic/P68 
coupled  with  a  basin  modelling  project  to  identify  the  reservoir  and  source  potential  in  these  structural  features.  
NOPTA is reviewing and considering the application.
Figure 1:  Prospectivity and plays identified across Vic/P41 and Vic/P68
Vic/P41: BAS 64.565% and Operator 
 
Exploration  permit  Vic/P41  (539  km2)  is  located  to  the  east  of  Vic/P68  in  the  offshore  Gippsland  Basin, 
approximately  40  kilometres  south  of  the  Victorian  coast.  As  displayed  in  Figure  1  above  the  Emperor  gas  play 
bounded by the Rosedale fault system continues into this permit from the adjacent Vic/P68 permit.

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR’S REPORT (CONTINUED) 
 
OTWAY BASIN ONSHORE 
 
PEP 150: BAS 15% 
 
This  permit  of  3,253  km2  is  located  near  Portland  and  contains  the  1989  Lindon  and  1995  Digby  1  wells,  both  of 
which  recovered  oil  on  test.  On  26  August  2013  the  petroleum  permit  PEP  150  in  the  onshore  Otway  Basin  was 
awarded to a consortium operated by Beach Petroleum Ltd. The permit is considered to be prospective for both oil 
and gas in the Sawpit and Casterton Formations, in both conventional and unconventional plays. 
 
Minimal  activity  and  expenditure  has  been  undertaken  in  the  permit  given  Victorian  government  moratorium  on 
exploration activities.   
 
On 30 August the Victorian Government announced an extension of the moratorium on onshore exploration activity 
till  30  June  2020.    Additionally,  exploration  and  development  for  unconventional  resources  as  well  as  fracture 
stimulation  has  been  banned.    Whilst  this  is  a  surprising  and  disappointing  outcome  from  the  review,  it  is  not 
expected to have a material impact on the Company.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED) 
 
Review of Financial Condition 
 
Liquidity  
The Group‟s consolidated statement of cash flows for the year recorded a decrease of $294,571 (2015: increase of 
$93,025)  in  cash  and  cash  equivalents.    The  cash  flows  were  derived  from  operating  receipts  of  $38,933  (2015: 
$62,505), other receipts of $6,162 (2015: $13,946) and capital raising net of transaction costs of $434,397 (2015: 
$1,354,535).  
 
Cash  outflows  relating  to  operations  of  $607,821  (2015:  $1,014,089)  exceeded  the  total  operating  inflows.  There 
were  also  net  cash  outflows  in  investing  activities  of  $166,242  (2015:  $323,872)  mainly  relating  to  petroleum 
exploration expenditure activities. Cash assets at 30 June 2016 were $457,054 (2015: $751,625).  
 
CHANGES IN THE STATE OF AFFAIRS 
 
Total equity decreased to $1,397,776 from $4,956,632, a decrease of $3,558,856.  The movement was the result of the 
operating loss for the year of $4,030,740 partially offset by the capital raising of $434,397.   
 
LIKELY DEVELOPMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS 
 
The  likely  developments  in  the  Group‟s  operations  in  future  years  and  the  expected  result  from  those  operations  are 
dependent on exploration success in the permit areas in which the Group currently holds an interest and the ability to 
fund the ongoing operations. 
 
FUTURE PROSPECTS AND BUSINESS RISKS 
 
The Group is exposed to a range of operational, financial and governance risks.  The Group has risk management and 
internal control systems in place to manage business risks.  
 
Funding risks 
 
The  future  growth  of  the  Group  is  dependent  on  acquiring  new  opportunities  and  raising  capital.  Adequacy  and 
availability  of  funding  will,  for  the  immediate  future  remain  a  key  focus  for  the  Group  and  its  Shareholders.  The 
Group will likely need to raise additional capital to implement and complete its business plans and meet all work and 
planned  and  unexpected  expenditure  commitments  on  its  permits.  In  the  unlikely  event  that  work  program 
commitments cannot be met, permits if not surrendered, can be cancelled by the relevant authorities. 
 
If  the  above  mentioned  additional  funding  is  not  raised,  there  is  uncertainty  regarding  the  ability  of  the  Group  to 
continue as a going concern, as set out in Note 2(c) of the financial report, the audit report contains an emphasis of 
matter paragraph in relation to going concern. 
 
Regulatory risks   
 
Operations by the Group may require approvals from regulatory authorities which may not be forthcoming, either at all 
or in a timely manner, or which may not be able to be obtained on terms acceptable to the Group. While the Group can 
reasonably believe that all requisite approvals will be forthcoming, and whilst the Group‟s obligations for expenditure will 
be predicated on any requisite approvals being obtained, the Group cannot guarantee that any or all requisite approvals 
will be obtained. A failure to obtain any approval would mean that the ability of the Group to participate in or develop any 
project, or possibly acquire any project, may be limited or restricted either in part or absolutely.   
 
Exploration and drilling risks   
 
Petroleum  exploration  involves  significant  inherent  risks  in  predicting  the  location  and  nature  of  potential  petroleum 
accumulations in the sub-surface. The Group cannot give any assurance that its exploration program will result in the 
discovery of any accumulation of oil or gas, nor that any discovery will be commercially viable or recoverable. Risks in 
relation  to  drilling  operations  include  break-downs,  delays  due  to  weather  or  sea  conditions  and  shortages  of  critical 
equipment or materials. There are also the financial and environmental risks of drilling incidents such as blow-outs, fires 
and oil spills. The Group mitigates these risks via its safety and environmental policies, plans and procedures and will 
arrange  appropriate  insurances  for  particular  risks.  All  of  these  risks  may  materially  affect  the  cost  of  drilling  or  other 
operations and adversely impact on any outcome from those operations. 
 
In the event that exploration programs prove to be unsuccessful, this will likely lead to: a diminution in the value of any 
of the Group‟s permits subject to such unsuccessful exploration activities; a reduction in the cash reserves of the Group 
by  virtue  of  the  costs  of  such  activities;  possible  increased  difficulty  in  raising  additional  funds  following  any  such 
unsuccessful activity (particularly drilling); and possible relinquishment of permits.
- 7 -
DIRECTORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED) 
 
Discovery risks  
 
Any  discovery  may  not  be  commercially  viable  or  recoverable.    For  a  wide  variety  of  reasons,  not  all  discoveries  are 
commercially producible. 
 
Contract risks 
 
The  Group  operates  through  a  series  of  contractual  relationships  with  operators,  technical  experts,  project  managers 
and contractors generally.  All contracts carry risks associated with the performance by the parties of their obligations as 
to time and quality of work performed.  Given that the Group is in joint arrangements with various other parties and has, 
or  may,  enter  into  farm  out  agreements  where  its  obligations  are  assumed  by  others,  the  incapacity  of  those  joint 
venturers or farminees to meet contracted obligations would adversely affect the Group‟s capacity to carry out its own 
activities.  
 
Environmental compliance and risks 
 
In  carrying  out  operations,  the  Group  and  its  relevant  Joint  Arrangement  participants  are  required  to  comply  with  the 
Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cwth) (“EPBC Act”) which specifies and regulates the 
environmental protections needed to be put in place by operators to avoid and minimise adverse environmental impact 
from  those  operations.      The  EPBC  Act  sets  out  stringent  conditions  which  operator  must  comply  and  imposes  rigid 
conditions  that  must  be  met  before  operations  can  commence.    In  the  event  of  breaching  any  such  conditions,  the 
Group may be liable to prosecution and the imposition of penalties. 
 
Further,  following  cessation  of  any  production  from  future  operations,  the  Group  will  be  required  to  participate  in 
abandonment programs resulting from operations in which it participates, removal of disused plant and equipment and 
where necessary, restoration of the environment that has been disturbed in the course of operations.  The cost of that 
participation  may  be  considerable  if  operations  result  in  significant  environmental  liabilities  being  incurred.    In  such  a 
case, any allowance made for rehabilitation could possibly be inadequate. 
 
SHARE OPTIONS 
 
Unissued shares 
 
As at the date of this report, there were no unissued ordinary shares under options (nil at 30 June 2015). 
 
INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS 
 
BAS maintains a directors and officers insurance policy and has paid an insurance premium for the policy. The contract 
of insurance prohibits disclosure of the amount of the premium and the nature of the liabilities insured.  Pursuant to the 
constitution the Company has entered into Deeds of Indemnity with the Directors and Chief Financial Officer. 
 
INDEMNIFICATION OF AUDITORS 
 
To the extent permitted by law, the Company has agreed to indemnify its auditors, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, as part of 
the terms of its audit engagement agreement against claims by third parties arising from the audit (for an unspecified 
amount). No payment has been made to indemnify Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu during or since the financial year.  
 
DIRECTORS’ MEETINGS 
 
The  number  of  meetings  of  directors  (including  meetings  of  committees  of  directors)  held  during  the  year  and  the

There have been no other changes to key management personnel after 30 June 2016 and before the date the financial 
report was authorised for issue.  
 
The  Board  of  Directors  (“the  Board”)  is  responsible  for  determining  and  reviewing remuneration arrangements for the 
directors and executives. No remuneration consultant was engaged nor was any remuneration advice sought during the 
period. 
 
The Board assesses the appropriateness of the nature and amount of remuneration of executives on a periodic basis by 
reference to relevant employment market conditions with the overall objective of ensuring maximum stakeholder benefit 
from retention of a high quality, high performing executive team. 
 
Remuneration Philosophy 
 
The  performance  of  the  Company  largely  depends  upon  the  quality  of  its  directors  and  executives.  To  this  end,  the 
Company embodies the following principles in its remuneration framework: 
  Provide competitive rewards to attract high calibre executives. 
 
Remuneration Structure 
 
In  accordance  with  best  practice  corporate  governance,  the  structure  of  non-executive  director  and  executive 
remuneration is separate and distinct. 
 
Non-Executive Director Remuneration  
 
Remuneration policy 
The  Board  seeks  to  set  aggregate  remuneration  at  a  level  that  provides  the  Company  with  the  ability  to  attract  and 
retain  directors  of  the  highest  calibre,  whilst  incurring  a  cost  that  is  acceptable  to  shareholders.  The  amount  of 
aggregate remuneration sought to be approved by shareholders and the fee structure is reviewed annually. The Board 
considers advice from external consultants if required, as well as the fees paid to non-executive directors of comparable 
companies when undertaking the annual review process. 
 
The  Company‟s  constitution  and  the  ASX  Listing  Rules  specify  that  the  aggregate  remuneration  of  non-executive 
directors  shall  be  determined  from  time  to  time  by  a  general  meeting.  The  latest  determination  was  at  the  Annual 
General  Meeting  held  on  3  October  2001,  when  shareholders  approved  an  aggregate  remuneration  of  $250,000  per 
year.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED) 
 
REMUNERATION REPORT (AUDITED) (30 June 2016) (continued) 
 
Structure 
The  remuneration  of  non-executive  directors  consists  of  director‟s  fees  and  committee  fees  for  the  non-executive 
director who chairs the Audit committee. The payment of additional fees for chair of the Audit committee recognises the 
additional  time  commitment  required  by  a  non-executive  director  who  chairs  a  sub-committee.  The  non-executive 
directors  also  receive  retirement  benefits in the form of superannuation. There are no other retirement benefits, other 
than superannuation. 
 
The table below summaries the non-executive director remuneration (excluding superannuation): 
 
Board fees 
Chairman 
Directors 
 
Incremental Audit Committee fees 
Chairman 
 
No other fees are paid for serving on Board committees or on boards of wholly owned subsidiaries.   
 
Non-executive directors have been encouraged by the Board to hold shares in the Company.   
 
The remuneration of non-executive directors for the period ending 30 June 2016 and 30 June 2015 is detailed in Table 
1 and 2 respectively of this Remuneration Report. 
 
The Directors waived accrued but unpaid Directors fees for the year ended 30 June 2015 and agreed to a reduction of 
50% of the above amounts for 1 July 2015 onwards, to be reassessed subsequent to a strengthening of the Company‟s 
cash position. As at the date of this report no reassessment has occurred. 
 
Executive Remuneration 
 
Objective 
The  Company  aims  to  reward  executives  with  a  level  and  mix  of  remuneration  commensurate  with  their  position  and 
responsibilities within the Company so as to: 
 
  Reward executives for individual performance; 
  Align the interests of executives with those of shareholders; and 
  Ensure that total remuneration is competitive by market standards.   
 
Structure 
In determining the level and make-up of executive remuneration, the Board engages external consultants as needed to 
provide independent advice. No consultant was engaged in the current year. 
 
Remuneration consists of fixed remuneration being base salary and superannuation and/or consultancy fees. 
 
The proportion of base salary and superannuation and/or consultancy fees for each executive is set out in Table 1. 
 
Fixed remuneration 
 
Objective 
Fixed remuneration is reviewed regularly by the Board, with access to external advice if required.   
 
Structure 
Executives  are  given  the  opportunity  to  receive  their  fixed  (primary)  remuneration  in  a variety of forms including cash 
and superannuation.  It is intended that the manner of payment chosen will be optimal for the recipient without creating 
undue costs for the Company. The fixed remuneration component of executives is detailed in Table 1. 
 
Employment contracts 
 
The company currently has no employment contracts in place.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016 
 
Note 1. Corporate Information 
 
The financial report of Bass Strait Oil Company Ltd (the Group, being the Company and its controlled entity) for the 
year ended 30 June 2016 was authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 1 September 
2016.   
 
Bass  Strait  Oil  Company  Ltd  is  a  company  limited  by  shares  incorporated  in  Australia  whose  shares  are  publicly 
traded on the Australian Stock Exchange.   
 
The nature of the operations and principal activities of the Group are oil and gas exploration.   
 
Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
 
Basis of Preparation 
 
The  financial  report  is  a  general-purpose  financial  report  of  a  „for-profit‟  entity  which  has  been  prepared  in 
accordance  with  the  requirements  of  the  Corporations  Act  2001,  Australian  Accounting  Standards  and  other 
authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board. The financial report has been prepared 
on an historical cost basis. 
 
The financial report is presented in Australian dollars.   
 
(a) Statement of Compliance
These financial statements are general purpose financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with 
the Corporations Act 2001, Accounting Standards and Interpretations, and comply with other requirements of law. 
 
The financial statements comprise the consolidated financial statements of the Group. For the purposes of preparing 
the consolidated financial statements, the Company is a for-profit entity. 
 
Accounting Standards include  Australian Accounting Standards. Compliance with Australian Accounting Standards 
ensures that the financial statements and notes of the  company and the Group comply with International Financial 
reporting Standards („IFRS‟). 
 
(b) New Accounting Standards and Interpretations 
 
In the current year, the Group has adopted all of the new and revised Standards and Interpretations issued by the 
Australian  Accounting  Standards  Board  (the  AASB) that  are  relevant  to  its  operations  and  effective  for  the  current 
annual  reporting  period,  resulting  in  no  changes  to  accounting  policy  changes  and  no  changes  to  recognition  and 
measurement. 
 
Various other Standards and Interpretations were on issue but were not yet effective at the date of authorisation of 
the financial report.  The issue of these Standards and Interpretations does not affect the Group‟s present policies 
and operations.  The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods 
will  not  materially  affect  the  amounts  recognised  in  the  financial  statements  of  the  Group  but  may  change  the 
disclosure presently made in the financial statements of the Group. 
 
(c) Going concern 
 
The  financial  report  has  been  prepared  on  the  going  concern  basis, which assumes that the Group will be able to 
realise its assets and extinguish its liabilities in the normal course of business and at amounts stated in the financial 
report.    This  includes  the  Group‟s  exploration  expenditure  commitments,  being  the  minimum  work  requirements 
under exploration permits for petroleum as set out in Note 22.  
 
For the year ended 30 June 2016 the Group incurred a net loss of $4,030,740 (30 June 2015: $836,252), had a net 
cash outflow from operating activities of $562,726 (30 June 2015: $937,638).  At 30 June 2016, the Group has cash 
and cash equivalents of $457,054 (30 June 2015:$751,625).
- 21 -
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016 
 
Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
(c) Going concern (continued) 
 
In order to meet the Group‟s exploration commitments, and continue to pay its debts as and when they fall due and 
payable, the Group will rely on taking appropriate steps, including:
  Obtaining approval for the variation to the Year 3 work programme lodged in respect of Vic/P68; 
  Raising  capital  by  one  of  a  combination  of  the  following:  placement  of  shares,  pro-rata  issue  to
shareholders, and/or further issue of shares to the public; and
  Meeting  its  additional  exploration  commitment  obligations  by  either  farmout  or  partial  sale  of  the  Group‟s
exploration interests.
If  the  Group  is  unable  to  successfully  complete  the  above  steps,  there  is  significant  uncertainty  as  to  whether  the 
Company  and  the  Group  will  continue  as  going  concerns and, therefore, whether they will realise their assets and 
extinguish their liabilities in the normal course of business. 
 
No adjustments have been made relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and the 
amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company and the Group not continue as 
going concerns. 
 
(d) Basis of consolidation   
 
The  consolidated  financial  statements  comprise  the  financial  statements  of  Bass  Strait  Oil  Company  Ltd  and  its 
subsidiary as at 30 June each year (the Group).  
 
Control  is  achieved  when  the  Group  is  exposed,  or  has  rights,  to  variable  returns  from  its  involvement  with  the 
investee  and  has  the  ability  to  affect  those  returns  through  its  power  over  the  investee.  Specifically,  the  Group 
controls an investee if and only if the Group has:
  Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of
the investee);
  Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and 
  The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
The  financial  statements  of  subsidiaries  are  prepared  for  the  same  reporting  period  as  the parent company, using 
consistent  accounting  policies.  In  preparing  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  all  intercompany  balances  and 
transactions,  income  and  expenses  and  profit  and  losses  resulting  from  intra-group  transactions  have  been 
eliminated in full.   
 
Subsidiaries  are  fully  consolidated  from  the  date  on  which  control  is  transferred  to  the  Group  and  cease  to  be 
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.   
 
Investments in subsidiaries held by Bass Strait Oil Company Ltd are accounted for at cost by the parent entity less 
any impairment charges. 
 
(e) Foreign currency translation 
 
(i)  Functional and presentation currency 
Both the functional and presentation currency of Bass Strait Oil Company Ltd and it‟s subsidiary is Australian dollars 
($). 
 
(ii)  Transactions and balances 
Transactions  in  foreign  currencies  are  initially  recorded  in  the  functional  currency  by  applying  the  exchange  rates 
applicable  at  the  date  of  transaction.  Monetary  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in  foreign  currencies  are 
retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of 
historical  cost  in  a  foreign  currency  are  translated  at  the  date  of  the  initial  transaction.  Non-monetary  items 
measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value 
was determined.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016 
 
Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
(f) Cash and cash equivalents 
 
Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position comprise cash at bank and short term deposits with 
an  original  maturity  of  three  months  or  less  that  are  readily  convertible  to  known  cash  amounts  of  cash  which  are 
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
 
For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as 
defined above. 
 
(g) Trade and other receivables 
 
Trade  and  other  receivables,  which  generally  have  30-60  day  terms,  are  recognised  initially  at  fair  value  and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost less an allowance for impairment. 
 
An impairment provision is recognised when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect the 
receivable.  The amount of the impairment loss is the receivable carrying amount compared to the present value of 
estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. 
 
(h) Investments and other financial assets 
 
Investments  and  financial  assets  in  the  scope  of  AASB  139  Financial  Instruments:  Recognition  and  Measurement 
are categorised as either financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held to maturity 
financial  assets  or  available  for  sale  financial  assets.    The  classification  depends  on  the  purpose  for  which  the 
assets were acquired or originated.  Designation is re-evaluated at each reporting date, but there are restrictions on 
reclassifying  to  other  categories.  When  financial  assets  are  recognised  initially,  they  are  measured  at  fair  value, 
plus, in the case of assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transactions costs.   
 
Recognition and Derecognition 
 
All  regular  purchases  and  sales  of  financial  assets  are  recognised  on  the  trade  date.  Regular  way  purchases  or 
sales are purchases or sales of financial assets under contracts that require delivery of the assets within the period 
established generally by regulation or convention in the market place. Financial assets are derecognised when the 
right to receive cash flows from the financial assets has expired or when the entity transfers substantially all of the 
risks  and  rewards  of  the  financial  assets.  If  the  entity  neither  retains nor transfers substantially all of the risks and 
rewards, it derecognises the asset if it has transferred control of the asset. 
 
(i) Joint arrangements 
 
Joint operations 
A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement, have rights to 
assets,  and  obligations  for the liabilities of the joint arrangement. Joint control is the contractual agreed sharing of 
control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent 
of the parties sharing control.  
 
The Group accounts for its share of the joint operation assets, and liabilities it has incurred, its share of any liabilities  
jointly incurred with other ventures, income from the sale or use of its share of the joint operation‟s output, together 
with its share of the expenses incurred by the joint operation, and any expenses it incurs in relation to its interest in 
the joint operation. 
 
(j) Plant and equipment 
 
Plant  and  equipment  is  stated  at  historical  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  any  accumulated  impairment 
losses.  Such  cost  includes  the  cost  of replacing parts that are eligible for capitalisation when the cost of replacing 
the  parts  is  incurred.  Similarly,  when  each  major  inspection  is  performed,  its  cost  is  recognised  in  the  carrying 
amount  of  the  plant  and  equipment  as  a  replacement  only  if  it  is  eligible  for  capitalisation.  All  other  repairs  and 
maintenance are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. 
 
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets as follows: 
Office furniture and equipment – over 3 to 10 years
- 23 -
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016 
 
Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)  
 
(j) Plant and equipment (continued) 
 
The  assets'  residual  values,  useful  lives  and  amortisation  methods  are  reviewed  and  adjusted,  if  appropriate,  at 
each  financial  year  end.  Gains  or  losses  on  disposals  are  determined  by  comparing  proceeds  with  the  carrying 
amount. These are included in profit or loss. 
 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no further future economic benefits 
are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of 
an  item  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  is  determined  as  the  difference  between  the  sale  proceeds  and  the 
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss. 
 
(k) Leases 
 
The determination of whether an arrangement is or contains a lease is based on substance of the arrangement and 
requires  assessment  of  whether  the  fulfilment  of  the  arrangement  is  dependent  on  the  use  of  a  specific  asset  or 
assets and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. 
 
Operating  lease  payments  are  recognised  as  an  expense  in  profit  or  loss  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  lease 
term. Operating lease incentives are recognised as a liability when received and subsequently reduced by allocating 
lease payments between rental expense and reduction of the liability. 
 
(l) Impairment of non-financial assets other than indefinite life intangibles 
 
Non-financial  assets  other  than  indefinite  life  intangibles  are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
 
The Group conducts an annual internal review of asset values, which is used as a source of information to assess 
any  indicators  for  impairment.  External  factors,  such  as  changes  in  expected  future  processes,  technology  and 
economic  conditions,  are  also  monitored  to  assess  for  indicators  of  impairment.  If  any  impairment  exists,  an 
estimate of the asset‟s recoverable amount is calculated. 
 
An  impairment  loss  is  recognised  for  the  amount  by  which  the  asset‟s  carrying  amount  exceeds  its  recoverable 
amount.  Recoverable  amount  is  the  higher  of  an  assets  fair  value  less  costs  of  disposal  and  value  in  use.  Non-
financial assets that suffered an impairment are tested for possible reversal of the impairment whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the impairment may have reversed.  
 
(m) Exploration and evaluation expenditure 
 
Exploration and evaluation expenditure is carried forward separately for each area of interest provided that the rights 
to tenure of the area of interest is current and either:


the exploration and evaluation activities are expected to be recouped through successful development and 
exploitation of the area of interest or, alternatively, by its sale; or 
exploration and evaluation activities in the  area of interest have not at the reporting date reached a stage 
that permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves, 
and active and significant operations in or relating to, the area of interest are continuing.
The  carrying  value  of  capitalised  exploration  and  evaluation  expenditure  is assessed for impairment at the area of 
interest level whenever facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying value may exceed its recoverable amount. 
  
An impairment exists when the carrying amount of capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure relating to an 
area  of  interest  exceeds  its  recoverable  amount.  The  asset  is  then  written  down  to  its  recoverable  amount.  Any 
impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.   
 
Farmouts 
The Group will account for farm-out arrangements as follows:
 

The Group will not record any expenditure by the farminee on the Group‟s behalf; 
The  Group  will  not  recognise  a  gain  or  loss  on  the  farm-out  arrangement  but  rather  will  redesignate  any 
costs previously capitalised in relation to the whole interest as relating to the partial interest retained; and
  Any cash consideration to be received will be credited against costs previously capitalised in relation to the
whole interest with any excess to be accounted for by the Group as gain on disposal.
- 24 -
the grant date fair value of the award; 
the current best estimate of the number of awards that will vest; and 
the expired portion of the vesting period.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016 
 
Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)  
 
(n) Trade and other payables 
 
Trade  payables  and  other  payables  are  carried  at  amortised  cost  due  to  their  short  term  nature  they  are  not 
discounted. They represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial 
year  that  are  unpaid  and  arise  when  the  Group  becomes  obliged  to  make  future  payments  in  respect  of  the 
purchase  of  these  goods  and  services.  The  amounts  are  unsecured  and  are  usually  paid  within  30  days  of 
recognition. 
 
(o) Share-based payment transactions 
 
Equity settled transactions: 
The Group has an Employee Share Option Plan (ESOP), which provides benefits to directors and senior executives 
in  the  form  of  share-based  payments,  whereby  employees  render  services  in  exchange  for  shares  or  rights  over 
shares (equity-settled transactions).   
 
The cost of these equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity 
instruments  at  the  date  at  which  they are granted. The fair value is determined using a binomial model. In valuing 
equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of 
the shares of Bass Strait Oil Company Ltd (market conditions), if applicable.   
 
The  cost  of  equity-settled  transactions  is  recognised,  together  with  a  corresponding  increase  in  equity,  over  the 
period  in  which  the  performance  and/or  service  conditions  are  fulfilled,  ending  on  the  date  on  which  the  relevant 
employees become fully entitled to the award (the vesting date). 
 
At each subsequent reporting date until vesting, the cumulative charge to profit or loss is the product of: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
The  charge  to  profit  or loss for the period is the cumulative amount as calculated above less the amounts already 
charged in previous periods. There is a corresponding entry to equity. 
 
If an equity award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the day of cancellation, and any expense not yet 
recognised for the award is recognised immediately.   
 
The ESOP has not been used by the Group for a number of years. 
 
(p) Contributed equity 
 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.  Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options 
are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. 
 
(q) Revenue recognition 
 
Revenue is recognised and measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable to the extent that 
it  is  probable  that  the  economic  benefits  will  flow  to  the  Group  and  the  revenue  can  be  reliably  measured.  The 
following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: 
 
Rendering of services 
Revenue from a contract to provide services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract.  
The stage of completion of the contract is determined by revenue from time and material contracts are recognised at 
the contractual rates of labour hours are delivered and direct expenses are incurred. 
 
Where the contract outcome cannot be reliably measured, revenue is recognised only to the extent that costs have 
been incurred. 
 
Interest income 
Interest  income  from  a  financial  asset  is  recognised  when  it  is  probable  that the economic benefits will flow to the 
Group  and  the  amount  of  revenue  can  be  measured  reliably.  Interest  income  is  accrued  on  a  time  basis,  by 
reference  to  the  principle  outstanding  and  at  the  effective  interest  rate  applicable,  which  is  the  rate  that  exactly 
discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset‟s net carrying 
amount on initial recognition.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016 
 
Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)  
 
(r) Income tax and other taxes 
 
Current  tax  assets  and  liabilities  for  the  current  and  prior  periods  are  measured  at  the  amount  expected  to  be 
recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those 
that are enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. 
 
Deferred income tax is provided on all temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets 
and  liabilities  and  their  carrying  amounts  for  financial  reporting  purposes.  Deferred  income  tax  liabilities  are 
recognised for all taxable temporary differences except:
  when the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability 
in a transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither 
the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; or
  when  the  taxable  temporary  difference  is  associated  with  investments  in  subsidiaries,  associates  or 
interests in joint ventures, and the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it 
is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred  income  tax  assets  are  recognised  for  all  deductible  temporary  differences,  carry-forward  of  unused  tax 
assets and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences and the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, 
except:
  when  the  deferred  income  tax  asset  relating  to  the  deductible  temporary  difference  arises  from  the  initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the 
transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; or
  when  the  deductible  temporary  difference  is  associated  with  investments  in  subsidiaries,  associates  or 
interests  in  joint  ventures,  in  which  case  a  deferred  tax  asset  is  only  recognised  to  the  extent  that  it  is 
probable  that  the  temporary  difference  will  reverse  in  the  foreseeable  future  and  taxable  profit  will  be 
available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.   The carrying amount of deferred income 
tax  assets  is  reviewed  at  each  reporting  date  and  reduced  to  the  extent  that  it  is  no  longer  probable  that 
sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised  deferred  income  tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent 
that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.   
 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when 
the  asset  is  realised  or  the  liability  is  settled,  based  on  tax  rates  (and  tax  laws)  that  have  been  enacted  or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date.   
 
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax 
assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to the same taxable entity and 
the same taxation authority.   
 
Other taxes 
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST except:
  when the GST incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, 
in which case the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense 
item as applicable; and 
receivables and payables, which are stated with the amount of GST included.

The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or 
payables in the statement of financial position. 
 
Commitments  and  contingencies  are  disclosed  net  of  the  amount  of  GST  recoverable  from,  or  payable  to,  the 
taxation authority.   
 
(s) Earnings per share 
 
Basic earnings per share is calculated as net profit/(loss) attributable to members of the parent, adjusted to exclude 
any  costs  of  servicing  equity  (other  than  dividends),  divided  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  ordinary  shares, 
adjusted for any bonus element.

The carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities are often determined based on estimates and assumptions of 
future  events.  The  key  estimates  and  assumptions  that  have  a  significant  risk  of  causing  a  material  adjustment  to 
the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities within the next annual reporting period are: 
 
Exploration and evaluation costs 
Significant judgement is required in determining whether it is likely that future economic benefits will be derived from 
the  capitalised  exploration  and  evaluation  expenditure.  In  the  judgement  of  the  Directors,  at  30  June  2016 
exploration activities in each area of interest where amounts remain capitalised have not yet reached a stage which 
permits  a  reasonable  assessment  of  the  existence  or  otherwise  of  economically  recoverable  reserves.  Active  and 
significant operations in relation to each of those areas of interest are planned and nothing has come to the attention 
of the Directors to indicate future economic benefits will not be achieved.   
 
In  the  event  where  ongoing  committed  activities  cannot  be  funded  by  existing  financial  resources,  the  Group  will 
either  need  to  raise  additional  capital,  or  meet  its  obligations  either  by  farm-out  or  partial  sale  of  the  company‟s 
exploration interests, or subject to negotiation and approval, vary the minimum work requirements. The Directors are 
continually  monitoring  those  areas  of  interest  and  are  exploring  alternatives  for  funding  the  development  of  those 
areas of interest when economically recoverable reserves are confirmed. If new information becomes available that 
suggests  the  recovery  of  expenditure  is  unlikely,  the  amounts  capitalised  will  need  to  be  reassessed  at  that  time. 
Refer to Note 14 for details of exploration and evaluation costs written off during the year. 
 
 
Note 3. Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies 
 
The Group‟s principal financial instruments comprise receivables, payables, cash and deposits. 
 
The Group manages its exposure to key financial risks, including interest rate and currency risk in accordance with 
the  Group‟s  financial  risk  management  policy.  The  objective  of  the  policy  is  to  support  the  delivery  of  the  Group‟s 
financial targets whilst protecting future financial security. 
 
The  Board  of  Directors  has  overall  responsibility  for  the  establishment  and  oversight  of  the  risk  management 
framework.  Risk  management  policies  are  established  to  identify  and  analyse  the  risks  faced  by the Group, to set 
appropriate  risk  limits  and  controls  and  to  monitor  risks  and  adherence  to  limits.  Risk  management  policies  and 
systems  are  reviewed  regularly  to  reflect  changes  in  market  conditions  and  the  Group‟s  activities.  The  Group, 
through  their  training  and  management  standards  and  procedures,  aim  to  develop  a  disciplined  and  constructive 
control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.  
 
The  Group  does  not  enter  into  or  trade  in  financial  instruments,  including  derivative  financial  instruments,  for 
speculative  purposes.  The  use  of  financial  instruments  is  governed  by  the  Company‟s  and  the  Group‟s  policies 
approved by the Board, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives. 
 
The  main  risks  arising  from  the  Group‟s  financial  instruments  are  interest  rate  risk  and  foreign  currency  risk.  The 
Group uses different methods to measure and manage different types of risk to which it is exposed. These include 
monitoring  levels  of  exposure  to  interest  rate  and  foreign  exchange  risk  and  assessments  of  market  forecasts  for 
interest rate risks and foreign exchange rates.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016 
 
Note 3. Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies (continued) 
 
Credit risk 
 
Credit  risk  arises  from  financial  assets  of  the  Group,  which  comprise  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  trade  and  other 
receivables, and other financial assets. 
 
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to 
the Group. The Group have adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient 
collateral or other security, where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. 
 
The  carrying  amount  of  financial  assets  recorded  in  the  financial  statements,  net  of  any  provisions  for  losses, 
represents  the  Group‟s  maximum  exposure  to  credit  risk  without  taking  account  of  any  collateral  or  other  security 
obtained. 
 
It is the Group‟s policy that all parties who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures 
including  an  assessment  of  their  independent  credit  rating,  financial  position,  past  experience  and  industry 
reputation. Risk limits are assessed for each individual party and are regularly monitored. 
 
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result being that the Group‟s exposure 
to bad debts is not significant. Currently there are no receivables that are impaired or past due but not impaired. 
 
The Group does not have any significant credit exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties 
having similar characteristics, other than deposits with the Group‟s bankers. The credit risk on  liquid funds is banks 
with high ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. 
 
Liquidity risk 
 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group‟s 
approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its 
liabilities  when  due,  under  both  normal  and  stressed  conditions,  without  incurring  unacceptable  losses  or  risking 
damage to the Group‟s reputation. 
 
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate 
liquidity  risk  framework  for  the  management  of  the  Group‟s  short,  medium  and  longer  term  funding  and  liquidity 
management  requirements.  The  Group  manages  liquidity  risk  by  maintaining  adequate  banking  facilities  through 
monitoring  of  future  rolling  cash  flow  forecasts  of  its  operations,  which  reflect  management‟s  expectations  of  the 
settlement of financial assets and liabilities. 
 
Adequacy  and  availability  of  funding  will,  for  the immediate future remain a substantial issue for  the Group and its 
Shareholders. The Group will, from time to time, likely need to raise additional capital to implement and complete its 
business  plans  and  meet  all  work  and  planned  and  unexpected  expenditure  commitments  on  its  permits.  In  the 
unlikely event that work program commitments can not be met, permits if not surrendered, can be cancelled by the 
relevant authorities. 
 
The  only  financial  liabilities  are  trade  and  other  payables.  At  30  June  2016,  the  Group  had  $131,148  (2015: 
$162,466) in trade and other payables.  Trade payables are non-interest bearing and have a contractual maturity of 
less than 30 days.   
 
The only financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, and other financial assets. At 
30 June 2016, the Group had $457,054 (2015: $751,625) in cash and cash equivalents, $10,511 (2015: $29,300) in 
trade and other receivables, and $16,133 (2015: $55,920) in other financial assets.   
 
Market risk 
 
Market  risk  is  that  changes  in  market  prices,  such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices  
will  affect  the  Group‟s  income  or  the  value  of  it‟s  holding  of  financial  instruments.  The  objective  of  market  risk 
management  is  to  manage  and  control  market  risk  exposures  within  acceptable  parameters,  while  optimising  the 
return. The Group has no material exposure to market risk.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016 
 
Note 3. Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies (continued) 
 
Foreign currency risk 
 
The  Group  is  exposed  to  foreign  currency  risk  on  purchases  that  are  denominated  in  a  currency  other  than  the 
respective functional currency of the Group. 
 
The  majority  of  the  Group‟s  cash  flow  is  denominated  in  AUD  and,  as  a  result,  the  Group‟s  exposure  to  foreign 
currency risk is minimal. 
 
The  carrying  amount  of  the  Group‟s  foreign  currency  denominated  financial  assets  and  liabilities  at  the  reporting 
date are $nil (2015: nil). 
 
Interest rate risk 
 
The following table demonstrates the estimated sensitivity to a 1% increase and decrease in the interest rate, where 
all other variables are held constant. Reasonably possible movements in interest rates were determined based on a 
review  of  historical  movements.  The  sensitivity  is  based  on  the  interest  rate  exposures  in  existence  as  at  balance 
date. 
  
 
 
 
Judgements of reasonably possible movements 
Impact on post tax profit 
+1% (100 basis points) 
 -1% (100 basis points) 
 
 
There  is  no  impact  on  equity  other  than  the  impact  of  the  above  post  tax  profit  sensitivities  would  have  on 
accumulated (losses)/profits. 
 
Fair value of financial instruments 
 
The  Directors  consider  that  the  carrying  amount  of  the  financial  assets  and  liabilities  recorded  in  the  financial 
statements approximate their fair values unless otherwise stated. 
 
Capital management 
 
Capital is defined as equity. When managing capital, management‟s objective is to ensure the entity continues as a 
going concern as well as to maintain optimal returns to shareholders. 
 
The Group will seek to raise further capital, if required, as and when necessary to meet its projected operations. The 
decision  of  how  the  Group  will  raise  future  capital  will  depend  on  market  conditions  existing  at  that  time.    It  is  the 
Group‟s  plan  that  this  capital  will  be  raised  by  any  one  or  a  combination  of  the  following:  placement  of  shares  to 
excluded  offerees,  pro-rata  issue  to  shareholders,  the  exercise  of  outstanding  options,  and/or  a  further  issue  of 
shares to the public. Should these methods not be considered to be viable, or in the best interests of shareholders, 
then it would be the company‟s intention to meet its obligations by either partial sale of the company‟s interests  or 
farmout, the latter course of action being part of the company‟s overall strategy. 
 
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.

The  net  carrying  amount  of  exploration  and  evaluation  costs  is  represented  by  Vic/P41  $577,983  (2015: 
$3,908,518), Vic/P68 $401,091 (2015: $290,529) and other $55,615 (2015: $50,710). 
 
Significant judgement is required in determining whether it is likely that future economic benefits will be derived from 
the  capitalised  exploration  and  evaluation  expenditure.  In  the  judgement  of  the  Directors,  at  30  June  2016 
exploration activities in each area of interest have not yet reached a stage which  permits a reasonable assessment 
of  the  existence  or  otherwise  of  economically  recoverable  reserves.  Active  and  significant  operations  in  relation to 
each  area  of  interest  are  ongoing.  Nothing  has  come  to  the  attention  of  the  Directors  to  indicate  future  economic 
benefits will not be achieved.  
 
In  the  event  where  ongoing  committed  activities  cannot  be  funded  by  existing  financial  resources,  the  Group  will 
either  need  to  raise  additional  capital,  or  meet  its  obligations  either  by  farm-out  or  partial  sale  of  the  company‟s 
exploration interests, or subject to negotiation and approval, vary the minimum work requirements. The Directors are 
continually  monitoring  the  areas  of  interest  and  are  exploring  alternatives  for  funding  the  development  of  areas  of 
interest when economically recoverable reserves are confirmed. If new information becomes available that suggests 
the recovery of expenditure is unlikely, the amounts capitalised will need to be reassessed at that time.  
 
In the current year, costs of $3,421,325 associated with the delineation of the Golden Beach play have been written 
off, as the play has been downgraded with no commercial drilling targets identified. 
 
Commitments and tenure of each permit are included in Note 22. 
 
On  30  August  2016  the  Victorian  Government  announced  an  extension  of  the  moratorium  on  onshore  exploration 
activity till 30 June 2020.  Additionally, exploration and development for unconventional resources as well as fracture 
stimulation has been banned.  The amount of capitalised exploration expenditure included above relating to licenses 
affect  by  the  Victorian  Government  decision  is  $55,615.    The  Directors  are  currently  evaluating  what  action  is 
required in relation to these licences.

Independent Auditor’s Report to
the members of Bass Strait Oil Company Ltd
Report on the Financial Report  
 
We have audited the accompanying financial report of Bass Strait Oil Company Ltd, which comprises the statement of 
financial position as at 30 June 2016, the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, the statement of 
cash flows and the statement of changes in equity for the year ended on that date, notes comprising a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information, and the directors’ declaration of the consolidated 
entity, comprising the company and the entities it controlled at the year’s end or from time to time during the financial 
year as set out on pages 16 to 39. 
 
Directors’ Responsibility for the Financial Report 
 
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in 
accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control as the 
directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view and is 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  In Note 2 the directors also state, in accordance with 
Accounting Standard AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements, that the financial statements comply with 
International Financial Reporting Standards. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. We conducted our audit in 
accordance with Australian Auditing Standards.  Those standards require that we comply with relevant ethical 
requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the 
financial report is free from material misstatement.   
 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
report.  The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error.  In making those risk assessments, the auditor 
considers internal control, relevant to the company’s preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view, in 
order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of 
accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the 
overall presentation of the financial report. 
 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion. 
 
Auditor’s Independence Declaration 
 
In conducting our audit, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001.  We 
confirm that the independence declaration required by the Corporations Act 2001, which has been given to the directors 
of Bass Strait Oil Company Ltd, would be in the same terms if given to the directors as at the time of this auditor’s 
report.
Liability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation.

Opinion 
 
In our opinion: 
 
(a)
the financial report of Bass Strait Oil Company Ltd is in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including:
(i)  giving a true and fair view of the consolidated entity’s financial position as at 30 June 2016 and of its
performance for the year ended on that date; and
(ii)  complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001; and
the consolidated financial statements also comply with International Financial Reporting Standards as disclosed in 
Note 2.
(b)
Material Uncertainty Regarding Continuation as a Going Concern 
 
Without modifying our conclusion, we draw attention to Note 2 in the financial report which indicates that for the year 
ended 30 June 2016 the consolidated entity incurred a net loss of $4,030,740 (30 June 2015: $836,252), had a net cash 
outflow from operating activities of $562,726 (30 June 2015: $937,638).  At 30 June 2016, the Group has cash and cash 
equivalents of $457,054 (30 June 2015:$751,625). These conditions, along with other matters as set forth in Note 2, 
indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the ability of the company and 
the consolidated entity to continue as going concerns and therefore the company and the consolidated entity may be 
unable to realise their assets and extinguish their liabilities in the normal course of business. 
 
Report on the Remuneration Report  
 
We have audited the Remuneration Report included on pages 9 to 14 of the directors’ report for the year ended 30 June 
2016. The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Remuneration Report in 
accordance with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Remuneration Report, based on our audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. 
 
Opinion 
 
In our opinion the Remuneration Report of Bass Strait Oil Company Ltd for the year ended 30 June 2016, complies 
with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001.
