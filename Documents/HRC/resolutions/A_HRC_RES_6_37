<p>Programme of Action<b>6</b> adopted by the General Assembly and the value of different 
</p>
<p>initiatives on dialogue among cultures and civilizations, including the dialogue on 
</p>
<p>interfaith cooperation and the Alliance of Civilizations, and committed themselves to 
</p>
<p>taking action to promote a culture of peace and dialogue at the local, national, 
</p>
<p>regional and international levels, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the importance of promoting dialogue in order to enhance mutual 
</p>
<p>understanding and knowledge among different social groups, cultures and 
</p>
<p>civilizations in various areas, including culture, religion, education, information, 
</p>
<p>science and technology, and in order to contribute to the promotion and protection of 
</p>
<p>human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p> <i>Underlining</i> the importance of education in the promotion of tolerance, which 
</p>
<p>involves the acceptance by the public of, and its respect for, diversity, including with 
</p>
<p>regard to religious expressions, and underlining also the fact that education should 
</p>
<p>contribute in a meaningful way to promoting tolerance and the elimination of 
</p>
<p>discrimination based on religion or belief, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing </i>the important work carried out by the Human Rights Committee 
</p>
<p>with respect to the scope of the freedom of religion or belief,

<p> <i>Seriously concerned</i> at all attacks upon religious places, sites and shrines in 
</p>
<p>violation of international law, in particular human rights and humanitarian law, 
</p>
<p>including any deliberate destruction of relics and monuments, 
</p>
<p> <i>Seriously concerned also</i> at the misuse of registration procedures and at the 
</p>
<p>resort to discriminatory registration procedures as a means to limit the right to 
</p>
<p>freedom of religion or belief of members of certain religious communities, at the 
</p>
<p>limitations placed on religious publications and at the obstacles placed in the way of 
</p>
<p>construction of places of worship inconsistent with the exercise of the right to 
</p>
<p>freedom of religion or belief, 
</p>
<p> <i>Convinced</i> of the need to address the rise in all parts of the world of religious 
</p>
<p>extremism affecting the rights of individuals and groups based on religion or belief, 
</p>
<p>the situations of violence and discrimination that affect many women as well as 
                                                 
<b>6</b>  See General Assembly resolution 56/6. </p>

<p>individuals from other vulnerable groups in the name of religion or belief or due to 
</p>
<p>cultural and traditional practices, and the abuse of religion or belief for ends 
</p>
<p>inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations and other relevant instruments of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting</i> that a formal or legal distinction at the national level between different 
</p>
<p>kinds of religions or faith-based communities may, in some cases, constitute 
</p>
<p>discrimination and may impinge on the enjoyment of the freedom of religion or belief,  
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing</i> that States, regional organizations, non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations, religious bodies and the media have an important role to play in 
</p>
<p>promoting tolerance, respect and freedom of religion or belief, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the importance of interreligious and intra-religious dialogue and 
</p>
<p>the role of religious and other non-governmental organizations in promoting tolerance 
</p>
<p>in matters relating to religion or belief, and welcoming different initiatives in this 
</p>
<p>regard, including the Alliance of Civilizations, the programmes led by the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the High-level 
</p>
<p>Dialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural Understanding and Cooperation for Peace, 
</p>
<p>held at Headquarters on 4 and 5 October 2007, 
</p>
<p> <i>Seriously concerned</i> at the slow progress in the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination 
</p>
<p>Based on Religion or Belief, 
</p>
<p> <i>Believing</i> that further intensified efforts are therefore required to promote and 
</p>
<p>protect the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief and to eliminate 
</p>
<p>all forms of hatred, intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief, as also 
</p>
<p>noted at the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia 
</p>
<p>and Related Intolerance, 
</p>
<p> <i>Having conducted</i> an assessment of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>freedom of religion or belief in the form of an interactive dialogue during its present 
</p>
<p>session, in accordance with its resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, </p>

<p> <i>Recalling</i> the resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council and 5/2 on the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures 
</p>
<p>Mandate-holders of the Human Rights Council of 18 June 2007 and stressing that the 
</p>
<p>mandate-holder shall discharge his/her duties in accordance with those resolutions and 
</p>
<p>their annexes, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Condemns</i> all forms of intolerance and of discrimination based on 
</p>
<p>religion or belief as well as violations of the freedom of thought, conscience, religion 
</p>
<p>or belief; 
</p>
<p> 2.  <i>Recognizes with deep concern</i> the overall rise in instances of 
</p>
<p>intolerance and violence directed against members of many religious and other 
</p>
<p>communities in various parts of the world, including cases motivated by Islamophobia, 
</p>
<p>anti-Semitism and Christianophobia; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Expresses concern</i> over the persistence of institutionalized or social 
</p>
<p>intolerance and discrimination practiced against many in the name of or due to their 
</p>
<p>religion or belief; 
</p>
<p> 4.  <i>Recalls</i> that legal procedures pertaining to religious or belief-based 
</p>
<p>groups and places of worship are not a prerequisite for the exercise of the right to 
</p>
<p>manifest one&#8217;s religion or belief; 
</p>
<p> 5.  <i>Emphasizes</i> that such procedures as described in paragraph 4 above, at 
</p>
<p>the national or local levels, as and when legally required, should be non-
</p>
<p>discriminatory in order to contribute to the effective protection of the right of all 
</p>
<p>persons to practise their religion or belief either individually or in community with 
</p>
<p>others and in public or private; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Condemns</i> any advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement 
</p>
<p>to discrimination, hostility or violence, whether it involves the use of print, audio-
</p>
<p>visual and electronic media or any other means; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Encourages</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</p>
<p>to continue to make efforts to coordinate in the field of human rights the activities of </p>

<p>relevant United Nations organs, bodies and mechanisms dealing with all forms of 
</p>
<p>intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief; 
</p>
<p> 8.  <i>Emphasizes</i> that promoting tolerance and acceptance by the public of 
</p>
<p>and its respect for diversity and combating all forms of intolerance and of 
</p>
<p>discrimination based on religion and belief are substantial elements in creating an 
</p>
<p>environment conducive to the full enjoyment by all of the right to freedom of thought, 
</p>
<p>conscience and religion, as enshrined in article 18 of the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Civil and Political Rights; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Urges</i> States: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To ensure that their constitutional and legislative systems provide 
</p>
<p>adequate and effective guarantees of freedom of thought, conscience, religion and 
</p>
<p>belief to all without distinction, inter alia, by the provision of effective remedies in 
</p>
<p>cases where the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, or the right 
</p>
<p>to practice freely one&#8217;s religion, including the right to change one&#8217;s religion or belief, 
</p>
<p>is violated;

</p>

</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To exert the utmost efforts, in accordance with their national 
</p>
<p>legislation and in conformity with international human rights and humanitarian law, to 
</p>
<p>ensure that religious places, sites, shrines and symbols are fully respected and 
</p>
<p>protected and to take additional measures in cases where they are vulnerable to 
</p>
<p>desecration or destruction; </p>

<p> (<i>f</i>) To review, whenever relevant, existing registration practices in order to 
</p>
<p>ensure the right of all persons to manifest their religion or belief, alone or in 
</p>
<p>community with others and in public or in private; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) To ensure, in particular, the right of all persons to worship or assemble

</p>
<p>purposes and the right of all persons to write, issue and disseminate relevant 
</p>
<p>publications in these areas;

<p>institutions is fully respected and protected; 
</p>
<p> (<i>i</i>) To ensure that, on account of religion or belief or the expression or 
</p>

<p>right to life, liberty or security of person, subjected to torture or arbitrary arrest or 
</p>
<p>detention, or denied the rights to work, education or adequate housing, as well as the 
</p>
<p>right to seek asylum, and to bring to justice all perpetrators of violations of these 
</p>
<p>rights; 
</p>
<p>(<i>j</i>) To ensure that all public officials and civil servants, including 
</p>
<p>members of law enforcement bodies, the military and educators, in the course of their 
</p>
<p>official duties, respect different religions and beliefs and do not discriminate on the 
</p>
<p>grounds of religion or belief, and that all necessary and appropriate education or 
</p>
<p>training is provided; 
</p>
<p> (<i>k</i>) To step up efforts in implementing the Declaration on the Elimination 
</p>
<p>of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination based on Religion or Belief;

<p> (<i>m</i>)  To promote and encourage, through education and other means, 
</p>
<p>including regional or international cultural exchanges, understanding, tolerance and 
</p>
<p>respect in all matters relating to freedom of religion or belief; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Stresses</i> the need to strengthen dialogue, inter alia through the Global 
</p>
<p>Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations and the Alliance of Civilizations, including 
</p>
<p>through the recently appointed High Representative of the Secretary-General for the 
</p>
<p>Alliance of Civilizations and the focal unit created by the General Assembly in its 
</p>
<p>resolution 61/221 within the Secretariat to interact with various entities in the 
</p>
<p>United Nations system and coordinate their contribution to dialogue; 
</p>
<p> 11.  <i>Invites</i> all actors to address in the context of that dialogue, inter alia, 
</p>
<p>the following issues within the framework of international human rights: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>)  The rise of religious extremism affecting religions in all parts of the 
</p>
<p>world; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>)  The situations of violence and discrimination that affect many women 
</p>
<p>as well as individuals from other vulnerable groups in the name of religion or belief or 
</p>
<p>due to cultural and traditional practices; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>)  The abuse of religion or belief for ends inconsistent with the Charter of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations and other relevant instruments of the United Nations; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Emphasizes</i> the importance of a continued and strengthened dialogue 
</p>
<p>among and within religions or beliefs, at all levels and with a broader participation 
</p>
<p>including of women, to promote greater tolerance, respect and mutual understanding; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Also emphasizes</i> that no religion should be equated with terrorism, as 
</p>
<p>this may have adverse consequences on the enjoyment of the right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>religion or belief of all members of the religious communities concerned; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Further emphasizes</i> that, as underlined by the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Committee, restrictions on the freedom to manifest religion or belief are permitted </p>

<p>only if limitations are prescribed by law, are necessary to protect public safety, order, 
</p>
<p>health or morals, or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others, and are applied in 
</p>
<p>a manner that does not vitiate the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Recommends</i> that the United Nations and other actors, including non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations and bodies and groups based on religion or belief, in their 
</p>
<p>efforts to promote freedom of religion or belief, ensure the widest possible 
</p>
<p>dissemination of the text of the Declaration, in as many different languages as 
</p>
<p>possible, and promote its implementation; 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Welcomes</i> the work of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion 
</p>
<p>or belief; 
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Concludes</i> that there is a need for the continued contribution of the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur to the protection, promotion and universal implementation of the 
</p>
<p>right to freedom of religion or belief; 
</p>
<p> 18. <i>Decides</i> therefore to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>freedom of religion or belief for a further period of three years and, in this context, 
</p>
<p>invites the Special Rapporteur: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>)  To promote the adoption of measures at the national, regional and 
</p>
<p>international levels to ensure the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>religion or belief; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>)  To identify existing and emerging obstacles to the enjoyment of the 
</p>
<p>right to freedom of religion or belief and present recommendations on ways and 
</p>
<p>means to overcome such obstacles; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>)  To continue her/his efforts to examine incidents and governmental 
</p>
<p>actions that are  incompatible with the provisions of the Declaration on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or 
</p>
<p>Belief and to recommend remedial measures as appropriate; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>)  To continue to apply a gender perspective, inter alia, through the 
</p>
<p>identification of gender-specific abuses, in the reporting process, including in 
</p>
<p>information collection and in recommendations; </p>

<p> 19. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to ensure that the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>receives the necessary resources to enable her/him to discharge her/his mandate fully; 
</p>
<p> 20. <i>Urges</i> all Governments to cooperate fully with the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>and to respond favourably to her/his requests to visit their countries and to provide 
</p>
<p>her/him with all necessary information so as to enable her/him to fulfil her/his 
</p>
<p>mandate even more effectively; 
</p>
<p> 21. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur to submit an interim report to the 
</p>
<p>General Assembly at its sixty-third session; 
</p>
<p> 22. <i>Also requests</i> the Special Rapporteur to submit the outstanding reports 
</p>
<p>to the Council in accordance with its annual programme of work and the next annual 
</p>
<p>report in 2009; 
</p>
<p> 23.  <i>Decides</i> to remain seized of this question under the same agenda item 
</p>
<p>and to continue consideration of measures to implement the Declaration.
