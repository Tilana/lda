</b></p>
<p>  Paragraph 59 <i>should read</i> 
</p>
<p>59. In many cases, national intelligence agencies also enjoy blanket exceptions to the 
requirement for judicial authorization. For example, in the United States, the Foreign 
Intelligence Surveillance Act empowers the National Security Agency to intercept 
communications without judicial authorization where one party to the communication is 
located outside the United States, and one participant is reasonably believed to a member of 
a State-designated terrorist organization. German law allows warrantless automated 
wiretaps of domestic and international communications by the State&#8217;s intelligence services 
for the purposes of protecting the free democratic order, existence or security of the State.37 
In Sweden, the Law on Signals and Intelligence allows for the interception of 
communications after authorization by the Foreign Intelligence Court. In the United 
Republic of Tanzania, the Intelligence and Security Service Act 1996 enables the country&#8217;s 
intelligence services to conduct any investigations and investigate any person or body 
which it has reasonable cause to consider a risk or a source of risk or a threat to the State 
security.
