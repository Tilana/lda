<p><b> I. Outstanding advanced questions from Troika 
</b></p>
<p><b>  United Kingdom 
</b></p>
<p><b> a) Please could you inform us as to whether an independent national human rights 
institution exists in your country and operates in accordance with the Paris principles 
designed to guide the practice of such institutions? 
</b></p>
<p>There is currently no independent national human rights institution in the RMI nor 
such an institution specifically established to comprehensively address human rights issue. 
Look at RMI&#8217;s response to Recommendation #55.9 for further elaboration. 
</p>
<p><b> b) We would be interested to know if civil society was involved in the preparation of the 
national report and how the Government will manage the follow-up to the Universal 
Periodic Review, and, who will be responsible for oversight of implementation, 
monitoring and reporting? 
</b></p>
<p>The civil society was indeed involved in the preparation of RMI&#8217;s national report. 
Consultations were made with various communities in the urban centers of Majuro Atoll 
and Kwajalein Atoll, i.e. Ebeye Island, from 15 March to 18 June. Moreover, the Women 
United Together Marshall Islands and the Youth-to-Youth-in-Health, both of which are 
NGOs, were members of the Resources Development Committee (RDC) which was 
established by Cabinet to prepare the report. Also note that the RDC also included the 
United Nations Joint Presence Office which consists of UNDP, UNFPA and UNICEF. The 
RMI Government is committed to maintaining this practice during the follow-up process. 
</p>
<p><b>  Germany 
</b></p>
<p><b>  In 2007 CRC recommended that Marshall Islands develop a comprehensive, rights 
based national plan of action, covering all areas of the Convention. In this exercise, it 
urged Marshall Islands to allocate sufficient human and economic resources for the 
implementation of the national plan and to use a participatory approach, involving 
children and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).Germany would appreciate 
information on such a national plan of action. 
</b></p>
<p>The Ministry of Internal Affairs, the national focal point for the CRC, is finalizing a 
DRAFT comprehensive, rights based national plan of action covering all aspects of the 
CRC. It is anticipated that said plan of action will be reviewed shortly by the Resource 
Development Committee (RDC) before it is presented to the Cabinet for its consideration. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Recommendations as published in the report of the Working 
Group, A/HRC/WG.6/9/L.10 
</b></p>
<p>55.1 The (RMI) <b>accepts</b> the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>The RMI is committed to abiding by the principles of the main human rights treaties 
and in continuing efforts in ratifying or acceding to the said treaties. However, the RMI is 
in need to technical and financial assistance in properly implementing these treaties. The 
RMI therefore calls upon the international community and bilateral partners in rendering 
such assistance in this regard. 
</p>
<p>55.2 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendations. </p>

<p>55.3 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55.4 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55.5 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55.6 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55.7 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55.8 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>The RMI Government has agreed to accede to the UNCAC after an informative 
workshop organized for the Members of the Nitijela with the support from the UNDP 
Pacific Center. 
</p>
<p>55.9 The RMI <b>notes</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>The RMI recognizes the importance of establishing national human rights 
institutions. However, at this point in time, it is difficult to favorably consider establishing 
such institutions due to the resources anticipated for not only establishing said institutions 
but also maintaining them as well. 
</p>
<p>55.10 The RMI <b>notes</b> the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55.11 The RMI <b>notes</b> the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55.12 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>55.13 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>55.14 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>The RMI continues its national efforts to promote human rights. Since 2000, the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs, which is responsible for women and children rights, has made 
efforts to raise awareness on women and children rights in the main urban centers and other 
populated atolls. However, due to limited resources, these activities have become sporadic 
recently. The RMI acknowledges the support of UNICEF in providing financial assistance 
to the promotion of human rights, particularly on children&#8217;s rights.  For women&#8217;s right in 
particular, the Women United Together Marshall Islands, an NGO, has made substantial 
progress in the promotion of rights of women at the national level. 
</p>
<p>55.15 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>The RMI is committed to addressing domestic violence and other issues affecting 
women. Progressive efforts have been made to raise awareness on domestic violence, and 
legislative step has been undertaken to prevent and protect women and children from 
domestic violence. A bill is currently being tabled by the <i>Nitijela</i> to prevent and protect 
domestic violence against women and children, and to punish perpetrators of domestic 
violence. This bill is the result of concerted efforts of both the Government and NGOs to 
develop legislative framework to reduce gender-based violence against women and 
children. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, the rights of women are progressively being realized at the national level. 
Modest progress has been made in advancing female education, employment, and other 
economic characteristics. However, while the female population has made great progress 
over the past several decades in improving primary and secondary education and towards 
equal participation in wage labor, female participation in the <i>Nitijela</i> remains unchanged at 
1 amongst 33 members. 
</p>
<p>55.16 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55.17 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. </p>

<p>55.18 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>55.19 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>55.20 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>The RMI is committed to properly implementing children&#8217;s rights and improving the 
situation of children at the national level. Decent progress has also been made since the 
establishment of the first coordinating committee, the National Nutrition and Children&#8217;s 
Council (NNCC) as well as the establishment of the Child Rights Office under the Ministry 
of Internal Affairs. The Resource Development Committee (RDC), which replaces the 
NNCC, is given a broader mandated to implement and coordinate programs and activities 
relating to both CRC and CEDAW. A Child Protection Baseline Research Project funded 
by the UNICEF is about to be completed, which will enable the RMI Government to 
develop policies and legislative measures with respect to child protection, and provide 
detail strategies for the implementation of CRC. 
</p>
<p>55.21 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>55.22 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55.23 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>55.24 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>55.25 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>55.26 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>The RMI Government currently does not have legislative framework for compliance 
with most international standards in relation to women, particular the participation of 
women in the parliament. The RMI Government is concerned that there has been no 
progress with respect to improving women&#8217;s participation in the <i>Nitijela</i>, i.e. 1 woman out 
of 33 members. To consider establishing a quota for women in the <i>Nitijela</i>, however, would 
require the appropriate constitutional amendment. On the other hand, the RMI Government 
is determined to adhere to the principles of democracy and ensure that its citizens freely 
elect whomever they wish to represent them. 
</p>
<p>55.27 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>55.28 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>55.29 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>The RMI acknowledges that rights of disable persons are not specifically afforded in 
our Constitution. However, we have policies and legislation which addresses special 
education and health for children. The <i>Education Act 1991</i> has a statutory framework for 
the education of individuals with disabilities. The policy statement in the Act calls on the 
Government to provide equal opportunities for all children to lead fulfilling and productive 
lives. The Act further states &#8220;to the extent practicable,&#8230;(disabled) children shall receive 
necessary supplement services in regular classrooms&#8221;. The Ministry of Education has 
promulgated regulations relating to special education, and has published Special Education 
Procedures and Handbook as guidelines. The special education programs has also received 
benefit from the United States in providing funding under the Federal grants, and has put in 
place policies relating to the education of individuals with disabilities in the Marshall 
Islands in relation to the grant. Currently, more than 800 children and youth with 
disabilities, ages 3 through 21s have been registered under the special education program.  
</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health provides programs and services for children with Special 
Health Care Needs (CSHCN). All babies born in the hospital are screened for 
abnormalities. Those identified with abnormalities are referred to the CSHCN program </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/12/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>under the Maternal and Child Health Care Program.  The program is responsible for annual 
medical check-up by specialists from the health providers in Honolulu, Hawaii. During the 
annual check-up, specialists may make recommendations for children with disabilities for 
off-island medical care. The Government is responsible for the expenses incurred in the 
referral. 
</p>
<p>The RMI Government has also taken other steps to address other needs of disabled 
persons. For instance, in 2008, the <i>Nitijela</i> amended the <i>Traffic Act</i>, to reserve parking 
spaces for persons with disabilities. The RMI Government, to some extent, has upgraded 
facilities to ensure accessibility for persons with disabilities such as installment of ramps 
and rails. Moreover, the RMI Government has endorsed the first week of December of 
every year, the Week of the Disabled, in recognition of children with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>55.30 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>The RMI is committed to developing socio-economic strategies and plans. In 2000, 
the RMI Government established the Economic, Policy, Planning and Statistic Office 
(EPPSO) to strengthen policy and planning capabilities, including improved collection, 
analysis, and dissemination of data. So far, EPPSO has improved the policy advice 
provided to the Government and developed resources, strategies and plans on socio-
economic. In 2010, the Government establishes the National Development Plan Work 
Group to develop the RMI national development plan and strategies.  The works are 
continuing and are anticipated to be finalized sometimes this year. On a related task, the 
National Census will be conducted this year in April; the last census was held in 1999. The 
outcome of the census report shall further guide the RMI Government in implementing the 
socio-economic plans and strategies. 
</p>
<p>55.31 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>55.32 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>55.33 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>55.34 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>55.35 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>The RMI supports the efforts to promote and protect the rights of prisoners and 
ensuring that living standards of and detention facilities for prisoners abide by international 
standards. The RMI acknowledges the poor living condition of its detention facilities, 
which has resulted in, amongst others, a number of prison escapes. The RMI Government 
has already considered improving the situation despite its limited financial resources, such 
as renovating the current detention facilities. The renovation program, which is now near 
completion, will provide a total capacity of 65 prisoners, an additional space from the 
previous setting, and will provide adequate lighting, ventilation and water closets for each 
cell. There are also special cells provided for female and juvenile prisoners. While these 
infrastructures are constructed, the Government plans to provide rehabilitation programs for 
juveniles such as small engine repair, carpentry, handicrafts, and so forth. 
</p>
<p>55.36 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>The RMI Government recognizes that the negative impact of climate change is a 
human rights issue. Consequently, national measures to build resilience, reduce disaster 
risk, support renewable energy and energy efficiency, and other adaptation measures are 
currently being implemented. Within the context of extreme vulnerability to climate change 
impacts, the RMI Government has developed a National Climate Change Policy 
Framework as a national blueprint to address national threats to climate changes in 
partnership with our regional and global partners. Presently, the RMI Government is taking 
a holistic approach to address climate change issues in the following nine priority areas: </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/12/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>a) Food and Water Security; 
</p>
<p>b) Energy Security and Conservation; 
</p>
<p>c) Biodiversity and Ecosystem Management; 
</p>
<p>d) Human Resources Development, Education and Awareness; 
</p>
<p>e) Health; 
</p>
<p>f) Urban Planning and Infrastructure Development; 
</p>
<p>g) Disaster Risk Management; 
</p>
<p>h) Land and Coastal Management, including Land Tenure; 
</p>
<p>i) Transport and Communication. 
</p>
<p>55.37 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>The RMI extended an invitation to the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights 
Council on the adverse effects of the movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous 
products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights to visit and access the situation in 
the RMI. The RMI&#8217;s proposed date of early March of this year conflicted with the 
Rapporteur&#8217;s schedule, so the RMI is awaiting alternative dates.  
</p>
<p>55.38 The RMI <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
