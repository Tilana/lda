<p><b>  22</b>/&#8230;<b> Contribution of parliaments to the work of the Human Rights  
 Council and its universal periodic review  
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> the crucial role that parliaments play, inter alia, in translating 
</p>
<p>international commitments into national policies and laws, and hence in contributing to the 
</p>
<p>fulfilment by each State Member of the United Nations of its human rights obligations and 
</p>
<p>commitments and to the strengthening of the rule of law,  
</p>
<p><i>Considering</i> that the Human Rights Council and parliaments stand to gain 
</p>
<p>considerably from exploring possible synergies to ensure that the universal periodic review  
</p>
<p>has the greatest impact at the national level,  
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> of the successive resolutions adopted by the General Assembly since 
</p>
<p>2010, in particular its resolutions 65/123 of 13 December 2010 and 66/261 of 29 May 2012, 
</p>
<p>which recognize the importance of continued parliamentary support for the work of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council and which encourage the Inter-Parliamentary Union, as the world 
</p>
<p>organization of national parliaments, to strengthen its contribution to the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council, particularly as it relates to the universal periodic review,  
</p>
<p>1. <i>Decides</i> to convene, at its twenty-third session, a panel discussion on the 
</p>
<p>contribution of parliaments to the work of the Human Rights Council and its universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review; 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p>2. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights to organize the panel discussion within existing resources and to liaise with the 
</p>
<p>Inter-Parliamentary Union, States Members of the United Nations, and relevant 
</p>
<p>United Nations bodies and agencies, as well as with civil society, including non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations, and national human rights institutions, with a view to ensuring 
</p>
<p>their participation; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Also requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to prepare a report on the 
</p>
<p>outcome of the panel discussion in the form of a summary. 
</p>
