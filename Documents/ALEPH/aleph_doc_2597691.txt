Business Profile
Zimplats Holdings Limited is a limited liability company which 
is  registered  in  Guernsey  and  is  listed  on  the  Australian 
Stock  Exchange.  It  is  in  the  business  of  producing  platinum 
group  and  associated  metals.  The  Company  is  a  subsidiary 
(87%  shareholding)  of  one  of  the  world’s  leading  producers 
of  platinum  group  metals  (PGMs),  the  South  African  based 
and  listed  Impala  Platinum  Holdings  Limited  (Implats),  which 
contributes approximately 25% of global platinum output.
The Company’s wholly owned operating subsidiary is Zimbabwe 
Platinum Mines (Private) Limited, which is a significant producer 
of PGMs, exploiting the ore bodies located on the Great Dyke 
in Zimbabwe. The Company has a Mineral Resource base of 
approximately 223.6 M oz. 4E.
 
The  operating  subsidiary  operates  four  underground  mines 
and one open pit mine which supply ore to three concentrator 
modules (two at Ngezi and the third one at Selous).
Three  of  the  four  underground  mines  are  operating  at 
full  production  while  the  fourth  one  is  currently  under  re-
development.  Production 
is 
processed by the three concentrators and then further refined 
at Selous where the smelter is located.
from  the  mining  operations
At year end, Zimplats had a workforce of 5 444  comprising 
3 041  permanent employees (a decrease of 6% in the year)
and a further 2 397  contractors (a decrease of 8% in the year).
Ore production in the period was 6.6 million tonnes (Mt) (2015: 
5.2 Mt). Converter matte sold during the period to the operating 
company’s  sole  customer,  Impala  Refining  Services  Limited, 
amounted to 582 833 4E oz. (2015: 381 849 4E oz.).
PLATINUM GROUP METALS – THE ‘GREEN’ METALS
PGMs  are  precious  metals,  which  frequently  occur  together  in 
nature as constituents of various ores and minerals. PGMs are 
a  family  of  six  metals:  platinum,  palladium,  rhodium,  iridium, 
ruthenium and osmium, all of which have similar chemical and 
physical properties and are grouped together in the periodic table.
PGMs are a vital component in autocatalytic converters which 
play  a  significant  role  in  controlling  air  pollution  by  reducing 
emissions in both gasoline and diesel engines.
PGMs  are  recyclable  thereby  ensuring  not  only  a  reduction 
in  waste  but  also  sustainability  of  supply.  Their  excellent 
resistance  to  corrosion  and  high  melting  points  make  them 
ideal metals for a variety of industrial uses. PGMs are used in 
fuel cell development. Fuel cells are able to reduce air pollution 
considerably while curtailing demand for fossil fuels.

Chairman’s Letter
DEAR STAKEHOLDER
We  remain  committed  to  the  worthy  goal  of 
sustainable development as defined by the World 
Commission  on  Environment  and  Development 
which is to “meet the needs of the present without 
compromising the ability of future generations to 
meet  their  own  needs.”  As  a  leading  business 
enterprise  with  an  operating  subsidiary 
in 
Zimbabwe, we believe that we have an important 
role to play in achieving this goal. To this end, we 
strive to operate in an economically, socially and 
environmentally friendly manner. We treasure the 
importance  of  stakeholder  engagement  in  this 
regard.
Your Company’s safety and operating performance 
for  the  financial  period  ended  30  June  2016 
(FY2016)  was  exceptional  and  better  than  what 
was  achieved  in  FY2015.  The  harsh  operating 
environment  characterised  by  depressed  metal 
prices,  resulted  in  your  Company  doing  much 
more to maintain more or less the same financial 
performance as was achieved during the previous 
period. In response to the challenges posed by 
the  depression  in  metal  prices,  your  Company 
instituted  a  number  of  survival  strategies  with 
stringent measures to contain costs and preserve 
cash. I am glad to report that the survival strategies 
implemented have so far yielded positive results.
I am delighted to report
that your Company 
completed yet another 
year without any fatality.
“
”
Chairman’s Letter (continued)
INDIGENISATION IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
In  FY2015,  the  operating  subsidiary  reached  an  agreement 
with  the  Government  of  Zimbabwe  on  the  sale  of  a  10% 
stake to the Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) as part 
of  its  indigenisation  implementation  plan  (IIP).  The  operating 
subsidiary  then  sought  approval  from  the  Reserve  Bank  of 
Zimbabwe (RBZ) for the vendor financing arrangements involved 
in the sale. In December 2015, the RBZ advised the operating 
subsidiary  that  it  had  deferred  making  a  decision  on  the 
matter until the Government of Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Youth, 
Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment had finalised, and 
announced, the new indigenisation implementation modalities 
which the Ministry was working on at the time.
the
issued  guidelines
On  8  January  2016,  The  Minister  of  Youth,  Indigenisation 
and  Economic  Empowerment 
for  the 
implementation  of 
Indigenisation  and  Economic 
Empowerment  Act  (Chapter  14:33)  in  Zimbabwe.  A  new  IIP 
was  then  developed  and  submitted  to  the  Government  of 
Zimbabwe on the strength of these guidelines. His Excellency 
the President of Zimbabwe subsequently issued a statement 
clarifying the government’s position on the indigenisation and 
economic empowerment policy.
The Company, through the operating subsidiary, continues to 
engage the government with a view to finalising the IIP.
COMPULSORY ACQUISITION OF PORTION OF MINING 
LEASE AREA
As  reported  previously,  in  March  2013,  the  Government  of 
Zimbabwe  gazetted  a  preliminary  notice  of  its  intention  to 
compulsorily  acquire  a  large  portion  of  ground  (constituting 
approximately  50%  of  the  remaining  ground)  held  under
11
the  operating  subsidiary’s  special  mining  lease  after  the  first 
surrender  of  36%  of  ground  in  2006.  As  you  are  aware,  in 
March 2013 the operating subsidiary lodged a formal objection 
to the preliminary notice to compulsorily acquire the land.
The  operating  subsidiary  has  been  involved  in  discussions 
with the government in an endeavour to achieve an amicable 
resolution  of  this  matter.  However,  on  29  June  2016,  the 
operating subsidiary was served with an application filed in the 
Administrative  Court  of  Zimbabwe  in  which  the  government 
was  seeking  an  order  authorising  the  acquisition,  by  the 
government, of the portion of the operating subsidiary’s mining 
lease area as described in the preliminary notice that was issued 
by  the  government  in  2013.  Zimplats  Holdings  Limited  was 
cited as the respondent in the application. Papers opposing the 
application  were  filed  on  behalf  of  Zimplats  Holdings  Limited 
and the operating subsidiary. The matter is therefore pending in 
the Administrative Court of Zimbabwe. The operating subsidiary 
will however still seek to engage the government in constructive 
dialogue in an endeavour to have the matter resolved amicably.
 
SAFETY, HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT
I am delighted to report that your Company completed yet another 
year  without  any  fatality.  Your  operations  achieved  more  than 
five million fatality free shifts during the year. Both the total injury 
frequency rate (TIFR) and lost-time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) 
improved by 24% (from 1.33 in FY2015 to 1.01  in FY2016) and 
34% (from 0.88 in FY2015 to 0.58  in FY2016) respectively, an 
indication that the Company’s safety programmes are working 
well.  Your  board  and  management  remain  committed  to 
achieving the ultimate objective of zero harm.
This item was the subject of the limited assurance engagement performed by EY.
12
Chairman’s Letter (continued)
Your Company continued striving to improve the health of its 
workforce and their dependents through the implementation of 
a workplace health programme that focuses on:
•  the management of HIV and AIDS
•   the management of and awareness on non-communicable
diseases
•  malaria control
•  occupational health monitoring.
I am also happy to report that your Company had another good 
year in terms of environmental management performance. There 
were no major environmental non-conformances reported in the 
year. The rehabilitation work on both the tailings dams and the 
closed open pit sites progressed well in the year. Great effort 
was  seen  in  resource  conservation  and  waste  management 
throughout  the  year  as  evidenced  by  the  growth  in  waste 
recycling across the operations and an improvement in water 
and energy efficiencies. Reduction of emissions of greenhouse 
gases remains an area of focus for Zimplats.
OPERATIONS
I  am  pleased  to  report  that  your  Company  achieved  record 
mining,  milling  and  metal  production  in  the  period.  Volumes 
achieved in the period surpassed the Phase 2 design capacity 
of 6.2Mtpa ore (mined and milled).
Ore mined increased by 26% from 5.2 million tonnes to a record 
6.6  million  tonnes  in  FY2016.  The  redevelopment  of  Bimha 
Mine is on course to reach design production in April 2018. The 
feasibility study for the development of Portal 6 (replacement 
mine for Rukodzi and Ngwarati mines which will be depleted in 
FY2022 and FY2025 respectively) is nearing completion.
I am  happy to report that  preliminary mine box cut  development 
works have  already commenced  and, once the  full  feasibility 
study  has    been  presented  and  approved  by  the  board,  the  
Zimplats teams will work to deliver the  mine on time and  on 
budget.
The concentrator plants operated well in the period milling a 
record  6.4  million  tonnes  (FY2015:  5.2  million  tonnes).  The 
concentrates  stockpiled  during  the  furnace  outage  last  year
were all sold during the period. As a result, platinum produced 
and sold (including concentrate sales) increased by 53%.
The financial results for the period were however not reflective of 
the excellent operational performance due to depressed metal 
prices which continued from the previous period. The cost per 
platinum ounce produced improved by 23% from US$1 551 to 
US$1 197 mainly due to the increase in production volumes and 
the cost containment initiatives implemented during the period.
TAXATION ISSUES
I am happy to report that the operating subsidiary continues 
to have constructive engagement with the Zimbabwe Revenue 
Authority (ZIMRA) in resolving legacy tax issues. Our preferred 
option will always be constructive engagement before seeking 
judicial determination should the need to do so arise.
ZIMPLATS’ CONTRIBUTION TO THE ZIMBABWEAN 
ECONOMY
Zimplats  continued  to  contribute  positively  towards  the 
Zimbabwean  fiscus  and 
the  economic  development  of 
Zimbabwe.  The  operating  subsidiary’s  local  procurement 
(excluding  payments  to  government  institutions)  increased 
from  71%  of  total  purchases  in  FY2015  to  75%  in  FY2016. 
The  total  value  of  local  payments  increased  from  US$209 
million in FY2015 to US$252 million in FY2016. In addition, the 
operating subsidiary contributed indirectly towards enhancing 
the  consumer  spending  power  in  the  country  by  paying  its 
employees a total of US$79 million in wages and salaries.

OUTLOOK
The  Company  remains  committed  to  exploring,  extracting  
and beneficiating the Zimplats Mineral Resource. To this end, 
feasibility  plans  are  being  advanced  to  expand  the  mining 
footprint through the potential development of the new mining 
portal (Portal 6) to replace two other portals which are being 
depleted. In addition, the Group conducted feasibility studies 
for  the  construction  of  a  second  furnace  to  reduce  the 
beneficiation risk.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
On  behalf  of  Zimplats,  I  would  like  to  thank  my  colleagues 
on  the  board,  management,  employees,  suppliers  and  other 
stakeholders for their commitment and resilience which enabled 
the Company to achieve excellent operational performance and 
satisfactory  financial  results  in  a  period  of  an  unprecedented 
decline in metal prices.
We shall soon be bidding farewell to two of our colleagues on 
the board. Muchadeyi Ashton Masunda and Dr Khotso David 
Kenneth Mokhele will retire as directors of your Company at the 
annual general meeting to be held on 14 October 2016.
Muchadeyi was appointed as a director of Zimplats in 2007. 
He  was  subsequently  appointed  as  deputy  chairman  of 
the board with effect from 1 March 2010. He was acting 
chairman of the board from 1 July 2012 until 30 June 2015. 
On behalf of the board, and on my own behalf, I would like to 
express our sincere gratitude to Muchadeyi for his valuable 
contribution to the Company and for his leadership of the 
board during his period as acting chairman. The board and 
management wish Muchadeyi all the best in the future.
 Khotso was appointed to the board in 2007. He served as 
the  non-executive  chairman  of  Impala  Platinum  Holdings 
Limited  from  2009  until  his  retirement  from  that  position 
in 2015. The board and I extend our sincere appreciation 
to Khotso for his significant contribution to the Company 
and for the guidance that he provided to the board over 
the years. The board and management wish Khotso every 
success in the future.
The future of the Company remains bright despite the pressures 
from  the  deteriorating  liquidity  situation  in  Zimbabwe  and 
soft commodity prices on the world market. Your Company’s 
management and the board will continue focusing on achieving 
production volumes, containing costs and preserving cash as 
the Company rides the storm arising from low metal prices and 
the harsh Zimbabwean operating environment.
to
Your  Company  will  continue 
foster  cordial  working 
relationships with all stakeholders including the Government of 
Zimbabwe,  its  suppliers,  employees,  the  community  and  the 
tax authorities. The board and management remain committed 
to complying with the laws of the country.
I look forward to a brighter FY2017.

The Group managed to complete yet another year without a 
fatality. By 30 June 2016, the Group had achieved over 5 million 
fatality free shifts.
The total number of LTIs recorded in the period decreased from 
12 in FY2015 (applying the revised reporting definition of LTIs, 
four  injuries  were  included  which  in  the  past  were  classified 
as restricted work cases) to eight  in FY2016. This resulted in 
the  LTIFR  improving  by  34%  from  0.88  (after  inclusion  of  the 
restricted work cases) to 0.58 . The total number of reported 
injuries decreased by 22% from 18 in FY2015 to 14  in FY2016 
resulting  in  the  total  injury  frequency  rate  (TIFR)  improving  by 
24% from 1.33 to 1.01 . The Group remains committed to the 
‘zero  harm’  objective.  Management  will  strive  to  achieve  this 
objective  through  behaviour-based  initiatives  and  adoption  of 
proven technology designed to reduce exposure of employees 
to a hazardous working environment.

Health
Management  continued  with  the  roll  out  of  the  integrated 
wellness  programme  that  focuses  on  the  reduction  of  HIV/
AIDS and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Unfortunately 
in the last quarter of the period, the external service provider of 
counselling and testing services scaled down its involvement in 
workplace programmes to concentrate on perceived high-risk 
areas in line with the national thrust. This resulted in a decrease 
in the number of HIV tests compared to the previous period. 
Management  is  in  the  process  of  identifying  an  alternative 
service provider to continue with this initiative. External service 
providers have proved to be more acceptable to employees and 
more effective in HIV/AIDS testing and counselling programmes 
compared to internal providers.
As part of the wellness programme, management introduced 
stress  monitoring  and  control.  By  the  end  of  the  period,  the 
specialist  service  provider  of  stress  management  counselling 
services  had  completed 
training  of  management  and 
supervisors and is currently rolling out the programme to the 
entire workforce.
The  malaria  monitoring  and  control  programme  was 
implemented in accordance with the plan and there were no 
cases of locally transmitted malaria in the period.

Chief Executive Officer’s Report (continued)
Follow up of employees who defaulted in terms of the process 
of  monitoring  occupational  health  was  tightened  during  the 
period, resulting in improved compliance among employees.

There were no major issues of environmental non-compliance 
reported from the internal and external audits carried out during 
the period.
The  rehabilitation  of  the  closed  open-pit  mine  continued 
as  scheduled  during  the  period.  Approximately  77%  of  the 
disturbed areas had been rehabilitated by the end of the period 
compared to 69% as at the end of the previous period. Good 
progress  was  made  in  the  rehabilitation  of  the  tailings  dams 
where a total of 16 hectares (FY2015: 2.5 hectares) were re-
vegetated and a total of 2 700 trees were planted during the 
period.
The Group’s water conservation strategy remained focused on 
enhancing water accounting and recycling. Water abstracted 
from  dams  and  underground  increased  by  24%  from  6  291 
mega litres in FY2015 to 7 777 mega litres in FY2016 in line with 
the increase in tonnes of ore milled. A total of 4 226 mega litres 
of water was recycled in the period (35.2% of total water used), 
marginally  lower  than  4  273  mega  litres  recycled  in  FY2015 
(40.5% of total water used in the period).
The  Group’s  waste  management  strategy  seeks  to  ensure 
compliance with the Zimbabwean Environmental Management 
Act  (Chapter  20:27)  and  its  regulations  pertaining  to  waste 
generated  from  mining  and  processing  activities.  Waste 
recycling is carried out as part of our commitment to reduce 
waste disposal. A total of 1 718 tonnes of scrap metal were sent 
off-site for recycling compared to 981 tonnes for the previous 
period. Waste paper recycling is being promoted and a total 
of 10 waste paper and plastics storage cages were erected to 
temporarily store the waste pending transportation to recycling 
companies. Used oil recycling is being done through licensed 
recycling  companies.  Trials  on  a  vermiculture  project  which 
involves  composting  of  biodegradable  waste  commenced  at 
one of our operations. These trials will be continued in FY2017.
Zimplats`  most  significant  air  quality  environmental  aspect 
relates  to  sulphur  dioxide  (SO2)  emissions  from  the  smelting 
operations. All point source air emissions discharge points are 
licensed by the Environmental Management Agency as required 
by  the  national  environmental  regulations  on  air  emissions. 
Feasibility  studies  for  a  sulphur  dioxide  emission  reduction 
project  commenced  in  the  previous  period  and  continued  in 
FY2016. Air dispersion models were also undertaken as part of 
the feasibility studies.

Mining
Following  the  precautionary  closure  of  production  operations 
at  Bimha  Mine  in  August  2014,  I  am  happy  to  report  that  the 
response plan to mitigate the loss in production, which included the
Chief Executive Officer’s Report (continued)
17
redeployment of fleets, resuscitation of the discontinued open-pit 
operations and the redevelopment of Bimha Mine was successfully 
implemented, resulting in record run-of-mine ore production of 6.6 
million tonnes in FY2016 (FY2015: 5.2 million tonnes).
The South Pit Mine performed ahead of expectation, producing 
874 000 tonnes in the period (FY2015: 106 000 tonnes). This 
mine will continue to bridge the ore supply gap until such time 
when  the  underground  mines  are  producing  at  the  Phase  2 
design capacity of 6.2Mtpa.
The redevelopment of Bimha Mine is on schedule to achieve 
design  capacity  by  the  fourth  quarter  of  FY2018.  Ore 
production from this mine increased from 350 000 tonnes in 
FY2015 to 442 000 tonnes in FY2016.
Ground monitoring systems instituted at all the underground 
mines  recorded  no  ground  movements  except  where  some 
activity was reported in the old footprint of Bimha Mine. The 
general conditions in the new footprint are stable.

PROCESSING
Concentrators
A record 6.4 million tonnes were milled in the period compared 
to  5.2  million  tonnes  milled  in  the  previous  period.  This  was 
made possible by excellent plant availabilities achieved in the 
period and improved ore supply from the mines.
The overall 4E recovery rate for the period decreased by 1% 
from 81.3% in FY2015 to 80.8% in FY2016 due to the decrease 
in  mass  pull  from  2.5%  to  2.1%.  Mass  pull  was  reduced  to 
match the volume of concentrate produced with the existing 
smelter capacity.

Smelter
A total of 135 843 tonnes of concentrate (FY2015: 119 500 
tonnes) were smelted during the period to produce 269 547 
ounces of platinum in converter matte, 42% higher than the 
190  027  ounces  achieved  in  the  previous  period.  4E  metal 
production for the period also increased from 383 962 ounces in 
FY2015 to 541 396 ounces in FY2016. A further 20 863 ounces 
of platinum (41 775 ounces of 4E) was realised from the sale of 
11 413 tonnes of concentrate stockpiled in the previous period 
due  to  the  furnace  break-out  incident.  This  resulted  in  total 
platinum ounces produced and sold in the period increasing 
from 190 027 and 188 760 ounces in FY2015 to 290 410 
ounces and 288 063 ounces respectively in FY2016.

CAPITAL PROJECTS
Expansion Projects
Implementation  of  the  Ngezi  Phase  2  Expansion  Project  is 
progressing well and project completeion is targeted in FY2017. 
A total of US$453 million has been spent to date on this project 
against a budget of US$492 million.
As was reported in our previous integrated annual report, the 
Group  commenced  the  refurbishment  of  the  SMC  BMR  in 
FY2015 with a view of commissioning it in July 2016. I regret 
to  report  that  the  rate  of  implementation  of  this  project  was 
affected by the availability of cash following the low metal price 
environment  which  has  persisted  since  FY2015.  As  a  result, 
US$22  million  has  been  spent  to  date  against  a  budget  of 
US$131 million. The project was therefore not commissioned 
in July 2016 as originally communicated. 
 
The  furnace  at  SMC  is  operating  at  full  Phase  2  capacity  of 
6.2Mtpa and the facility has been derisked through operating 
it at reduced power. A bankable feasibility study for a second 
15MW  rectangular  furnace  to  manage  risks  associated  with 
the  existing  circular  furnace  was  carried  out  and  completed 
in July 2016. Once approved, it is anticipated that the second 
furnace could be ready for commissioning by the first quarter 
of FY2019.
A total of US$27 million was spent on expansion projects in the 
period compared to US$38 million in the previous period.
Stay in Business Projects
The implementation of the Bimha Mine redevelopment project 
progressed  on  schedule  in  the  period  and  the  project  is  on 
course to achieve design production capacity by April 2018. A 
total of US$16.3 million has been spent to date and US$15.2 
million has been committed.
A total of US$16 million was spent on the replacement of trackless 
mining machinery in line with the current replacement plan.
The initial development of the box cut for Portal 6 mine, targeting 
to replace Rukodzi and Ngwarati mines that deplete in FY2022 
and FY2025 respectively, commenced in June 2016. Once the 
project has been approved, the proposed mine is scheduled to 
reach full production of 2.2Mtpa in August 2025 at a total cost 
of US$266 million.
A total of US$42 million was spent on stay in business projects 
during  the  period,  11%  lower  than  the  US$47  million  in  the 
previous period.

HUMAN RESOURCES
Staff turnover increased from 4.3% to 6.3% during the period, 
driven mainly by the implementation of a labour rationalisation 
exercise  and  retirements.  The  Group’s  industrial  relations 
for the period were stable and the general market trends are 
continuously being monitored.
The  Group  implemented  a  labour  rationalisation  exercise  in 
response to the difficult operating environment. As a result, the 
total  number  of  permanent  employees  decreased  by  5%  to 
close the period at 3 041 . The average number of contractor 
employees also decreased by 8% from 2 605 to 2 397  due to 
reduced activity on the BMR project.
Satisfactory  progress  was  made  in  the  period  on  the  home 
ownership  scheme  for  the  employees  based  at  SMC.  Title 
surveys for the land earmarked for the housing development 
were submitted for approval by the Surveyor-General’s Office 
and model houses have been completed and approved by the 
employees. Funding options for the delivery of the houses are 
currently under consideration.
Work on the employee share ownership trust (ESOT) continued 
during the period under review with a view to concluding the 
transaction in the new financial period.

SOCIAL INVESTMENTS
Despite depressed metal prices, an investment of US$2 million 
(FY2015: US$1 million) in social development was made during 
the period. Key to the development projects undertaken during 
the  period  was  the  construction  of  a  community  stadium  at 
Turf. The stadium has enhanced sporting activities in the town 
with Premier League Soccer now being played in the area, a 
development  that  has  brought  much  excitement  to  the  Turf 
community. Several social development projects have also been 
undertaken covering health, livestock development, education 
and local enterprise development.
Local procurement increased from 71% in FY2015 to 75% in 
FY2016. The Group continues to play a pivotal role in terms 
of national development and on local enterprise development.
The Group is committed to spending more funds towards social 
investments as the operating environment improves.
FINANCIAL RESULTS
The financial results of the Group were adversely affected by 
the significant decline in metal prices experienced during the 
period. Revenue for the period increased by 16% from US$408 
million in FY2015 to US$472 million despite the 53% increase 
in 4E sales volumes from 381 849 ounces to 582 833 ounces. 
This was due to lower metal prices which saw gross revenue 
per platinum ounce decrease from US$2 167 to US$1 638.
Localenterprisedevelopment

Chief Executive Officer’s Report (continued)
Cost of sales increased by 24% from US$316 million in FY2015 
to  US$391  million  despite  the  53%  increase  in  4E  sales 
volumes, reflecting the benefit of the cost containment initiatives 
implemented in response to the declining metal prices.
Gross profit margins deteriorated from 23% in the prior period 
to 17% in the current period due to the net effect of lower metal 
prices and the impact of higher production and sales volumes.
Administrative expenses decreased by 14% from US$41.8 million 
in FY2015 to US$35.9 million in the current period due to the 
implementation of various cost rationalisation measures. Selling 
and distribution expenses increased by 126% from US$2.3 
million in FY2015 to US$5,2 million in FY2016 mainly due to 
the sale of concentrates which attract higher transport charges.
Operating cash cost per platinum ounce improved by 23% from 
US$1 551 in FY2015 to US$1 197 in FY2016 due to a 53% 
increase in platinum produced (including metal in concentrate 
sold)  and  cost  savings  realised  from  the  cost  rationalisation 
initiatives.
Cash Operating Cost per Platinum Ounce
Labour Headcount and Turnover
Insurance  proceeds  of  US$3.7  million,  received  in  full  and 
final settlement of the Bimha Mine partial collapse claim, were 
recognised in FY2016.
In May 2016, the RBZ introduced an export incentive scheme 
to promote the export of goods and services to enhance inflows 
of  foreign  currency.  The  Group  was  awarded  a  2.5%  export 
incentive (amounting to US1.1 million) on the export proceeds 
received in Zimbabwe for the month of May 2016.
As a result of these factors, profit before income tax for the period 
decreased from US$56.1 million in FY2015 to US$29.4 million.
Income tax expense for the period at US$22 million was 83% 
lower than the previous period. The previous period’s income 
tax was higher than usual due to a US$55.6 million additional 
profits tax (APT) adjustment in respect of prior periods arising 
from  the  disallowance  of  assessed  income  tax  losses  in 
computing APT and the US$45.8 million APT on the refund of 
overpaid royalties. This resulted in a profit after tax for the period 
of US$7.3 million compared to a US$74 million loss recorded in 
the previous period.

Net  cash  generated  from  operating  activities  decreased  from 
US$142.2 million  in FY2015 to  US$36  million. Cash generated 
from operating activities in the prevous period benefited from the 
royalty refund, which was used to offset some of the prior periods’ 
tax obligations. At period-end, the Group had bank borrowings 
amounting to US$109 million (2015: US$82 million) and a cash 
balance of US$56 million (2015: US$73.5 million).
The  prior  period  results  benefited  from  the  US$95.8  million 
royalty  overpayment  refund  as  a  result  of  the  High  Court  of 
Zimbabwe judgment in the case involving a dispute between 
the  operating  subsidiary  and  ZIMRA  over  royalty  provisions 
applicable to the operating subsidiary.
The  prior  period  results  were  also  negatively  affected  by  the

Achievements FY2016
OBJECTIVE
STATUS
Improve  safety  culture  and  performance  through 
the  implementation  of  identified  interventions  and 
eliminate  fatalities.  Achieve  target  LTIFR  of  0.60 
(applying the revised reporting definition of LTIFR to 
include restricted work cases in the definition of lost-
time – see page 2 of this report)
• There were no  fatalities reported in the year
•  Eight  lost-time injuries recorded, down from 12 in FY2015 (applying the
revised reporting definition of LTIs to include restricted work cases)
•  LTIFR  improved  from  0.88  in  FY2015  (applying  the  revised  reporting
definition to include restricted work cases) to 0.58  in FY2016
•  TIFR improved from 1.33 in FY2015 to 1.01  in FY2016
Achieve planned FY2016 production volumes and 
efficiencies
• Record production volumes were achieved 
• Tonnes mined and milled were 4% and 3% above plan respectively
• Head grade was 2% below plan
• Concentrator recovery rates were on plan
• Platinum production was 4% above target
Achieve planned FY2016 cost performance
Cash operating cost per platinum ounce at US$1 197 was 11% and 23% 
better than target and prior year respectively
Cash preservation
Contain the effects of shear-induced ground 
instability at all the underground mines
• Operating cash cost per platinum ounce was 11% below plan
• Capital expenditure was 31% below plan
• Cash net of debt was 82% above target
•  Consumable stocks holding reduction by US$3 million
•  Bimha Mine re-development on schedule to reach design production in

• Signs of ground movement are being monitored at all mines 
• Stable ground conditions prevailed throughout the year
• 100% compliance with the set pillar width to height ratio at all mines
Maintain the local supply base at a minimum of 65% 
of annual spend, excluding government institutions
Purchases from local suppliers in FY2016 accounted for 75% (2015: 71%) of 
the Group’s annual expenditure on goods and services, excluding government 
institutions.
Complete refurbishment of the BMR for 
commissioning to commence in July 2016
The refurbishment of the BMR was affected by cash availability in a low metal 
price environment, which has persisted since 2015. As a result, US$22 million 
has been spent to date against a budget of US$131 million.
Retain certification on the ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and 
OHSAS 18001 Systems
Certification retained.
Comply with the existing tax legislation to minimise 
risks of non-compliance penalties and interests
Tax compliance audits were carried out by external tax experts in the year 
and no major compliance issues were raised. All the known prior years’ tax 
obligations are now either agreed with the tax authorities or before the courts.
Complete capital expenditure projects within 
approved budgets
Capital votes closed during the year were within budget.
This item was the subject of the limited assurance engagement performed by EY.

Market Review
Note:  Periods  referred  to  in  this  section  are  mostly  calendar 
years, unless stated otherwise
Business context
Globally, the mining and minerals sector has faced a challenging 
few  years  characterised  by  depressed  commodity  prices, 
sluggish  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  rates  across 
developed  and  emerging  markets,  rising  production  costs 
and  high  levels  of  exchange  rate  volatility.  The  reduction  in 
economic  activity,  rising  geopolitical  tensions  and  economic 
uncertainty  in  many  regions,  compounded  by  the  recent 
Brexit  vote  in  the  United  Kingdom,  has  heightened  pressure 
on governments across the world. There has been increased 
pressure  in  particular  on  resource-dependent  middle-income 
countries, many of which are seeking to extract greater value 
from resource companies in an effort to deliver on the social 
expectations of an increasingly frustrated electorate.
These  pressures  on  the  global  mining  sector  have  been 
accompanied  by  market  challenges  specific  to  the  platinum 
industry, as well as by the difficult operating conditions in South 
Africa and Zimbabwe. In the context of subdued global PGM 
prices,  platinum  miners  are  facing  heightened  stakeholder 
expectations  on  a  range  of  fronts:  communities  are  making 
increasingly  vocal  demands  for  economic  opportunities  and 
improved  local  service  delivery;  governments  continue  to 
push for rapid transformation, indigenisation and employment 
creation;  labour  unions  exert  pressure  for  higher  wages  and 
jostle  for  power;  while  a  cautious  investment  community 
maintains  its  call  for  enhanced  cost  efficiencies,  capital

management and dividends. Regulatory uncertainty continues 
in South Africa and Zimbabwe and the region faces on-going 
challenges  in  electricity  supply,  pressure  on  water  availability 
following the El Niño drought, rising input costs, depreciating 
local currencies and a challenging labour relations environment.
The global macroeconomic picture remains uncertain
Uncertainty about how the global economy will grow this year 
and  next  remains.  This  is  reflected  in  the  continued  growth 
downgrades  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF).  The 
IMF’s  release  of  its  World  Economic  Outlook  update  in  July 
2016  highlighted  a  modest  3.1%  baseline  projection  for 
global growth in 2016. However, this was a 0.3% downward 
revision  relative  to  the  January  2016  update  and  0.5% 
down  against  the  October  2015  report.  Economic  growth  is 
projected  to  strengthen  in  2017  to  3.4%,  driven  primarily  by 
emerging  markets  and  developing  economies,  as  conditions 
in stressed economies start to gradually normalise. However, 
the uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote may lead to lower 
economic growth in general.
Despite the global macroeconomic uncertainty, overall demand 
for  PGMs  from  major  sectors  remained  healthy  during  2015 
and continued to hold its ground during the first half of 2016. 
Secondary PGM supply was affected by the low PGM and steel 
price environment, which led to some hoarding by collectors.
Primary  PGM  supply  continues  to  be  at  risk  due  to  the 
continued lack of capital investment and the challenging mining 
environment  in  Southern  Africa.  The  low  price  environment 
has meant some unprofitable shafts have been closed, while

challenges  in  terms  of  section  54  safety  stoppages,  the 
increasing cost of production and tragic safety incidents remain.
At last practicable date of this annual report the palladium price 
was US$668 per oz.
Market performance 
The platinum and palladium markets remained in a fundamental 
deficit during 2015, while the rhodium market showed a small 
surplus. For platinum and palladium, the fundamental deficits 
have remained since 2012, driven by a healthy demand being 
unmet by both primary and secondary supply as accumulated 
above  ground  stocks  continued  to  satisfy  the  market.  The 
rhodium surplus in 2015 was mainly driven by major producers 
and  traders  selling  their  holdings  to  the  automotive  and 
industrial  sectors  during  the  year.  For  all  three  metals,  these 
trends continued during the first half of 2016 and are expected 
to  continue  during  the  second  half.    Platinum  and  palladium 
markets are expected to remain in fundamental deficit during 
2016 and the rhodium market is expected to remain in surplus. 
Accumulated  above  ground  stocks  will  continue  to  provide 
some measure of support during this period.
Platinum prices started the financial year (July 2015) at US$1 085 
per ounce and continued their decline reaching a low of US$ 814 
per ounce in January 2016. This was driven by the pervasive 
negative  sentiment  towards  industrial  metals,  rather  than  their 
fundamentals.  However,  prices  bounced  back  after  January 
2016, to reach US$1 084 per ounce during May 2016. The price 
increase was on the back of positive investor sentiment, healthy 
demand and tight supply conditions from South Africa during the 
first quarter of calendar year 2016. Platinum sponge shortages 
during this period mainly affected the premium paid for sponge 
over ingots and did not sustain any upward price movement 
and prices closed lower at US$ 999 per ounce at the end of 
June 2016. At last practicable date of this annual report the 
platinum price was US$1 048 per oz.
Palladium  prices  opened  the  financial  year  at  US$687  per 
ounce  reaching  a  high  of  US$723  per  ounce  in  September 
2015 a level not reached again during the period under review. 
Palladium closed the financial year at US$589 after reaching a 
low of US$465 per ounce in January 2016. As with platinum, the 
palladium  price  tracked  macroeconomic  factors,  in  particular 
the news of the cooling Chinese economy and negative investor 
sentiment, rather than demonstrating the metal’s fundamentals.

In contrast to platinum and palladium, rhodium prices reflected 
market  fundamentals  of  supply  and  demand  throughout  the 
period under review. The overall price of rhodium declined from 
US$813 per ounce in July 2015, to close at US$650 per ounce 
at the end of June 2016 on the back of a generally oversupplied 
market.
The  23%  depreciation  of  the  rand  dollar  exchange  rate  and 
some restricted appreciation of prices post January 2016 did 
support  rand  prices  for  PGMs,  giving  partial  relief  to  cash-
constrained South African platinum miners.

Automotive
Overall,  2015  was  a  relatively  positive  year  for  the  global 
automotive industry, which achieved 1.8% growth for light-duty 
vehicle sales, reaching 88 million units. This was the slowest 
growth rate since 2009 due to declines in units sold in Japan, 
South America and Russia. However, these declines were offset 
by record sales in North America, Western Europe and China. 
Concerns over the sustainability of diesel demand in Western 
Europe have proven to be largely unfounded and sales remain 
robust. Diesel is a key part of automakers’ strategy in meeting 
stringent carbon dioxide emissions targets. Issues around the 
“cheat devices” have served to tighten emissions test protocols, 
potentially boosting PGM demand in this application.
The  first  half  year-to-date  sales  in  North  America,  Western 
Europe and China were similarly encouraging at growth rates 
of  1.4%,  8.4%  and  9.2%  respectively.  However,  growing 
concerns about financial volatility in these markets may result 
in the second half being flatter, with estimated global light-duty 
vehicle sales reaching 90 million units in 2016.

Despite  the  on-going  substitution  of  platinum  with  palladium 
in  gasoline  and  some  diesel  autocatalysts,  platinum  demand 
continued to benefit from growing use in light- and heavy-duty 
diesel  vehicles,  which  exceeded  3.2  million  ounces  in  2015. 
The growth in vehicle sales and the substitution of platinum by 
palladium resulted in palladium demand from the automotive 
sector reaching 7.7 million ounces in 2015. For rhodium, the use 
in autocatalysts amounted to 0.83 million ounces during 2015, 
autocatalyst thrifting was offset by increased requirements for 
rhodium in diesel vehicles.
Jewellery
The  2015  PGI  retail  barometer  showed  the  economic  slow-
down  in  China  affecting  the  jewellery  industry,  resulting  in 
Chinese  platinum  jewellery  demand  declining  by  4%  during 
2015. This was partially offset by growth in other regions. India 
recorded a 24% increase on the back of the “Platinum Day of 
Love”  programme  and  better  market  penetration,  while  the 
“Evara” programme drove demand for heavier jewellery for both 
men and women. The 10% growth in the US was largely driven
by low platinum prices, which incentivised manufacturers and 
retailers to stock and sell platinum. The 2.7% growth seen in 
Japan was due to the trend of bridal couples buying matching 
platinum wedding rings instead of buying one ring for the bride, 
while non-bridal platinum demand benefited from an increase 
in purchases of heavier items, such as necklaces and pendants. 
Global platinum jewellery demand declined by just 5 000 ounces, 
reaching 3.025 million ounces during 2015.
The first half of 2016 has been challenging, especially in China 
where retailers experienced a slow start during the first quarter 
due largely to a short sales season caused by an overlap of the 
Chinese New Year and Valentine’s Day. However, there were 
robust sales in India and the US, and the Japanese preference 
for  platinum  (under  favourable  metal  prices)  over  white  gold 
meant that first half sales in 2016 were similar to the previous 
comparable period.
Industrial 
Industrial demand remained healthy in 2015 and into the first 
half of 2016, driven largely by chemical, electrical and fuel cell 
applications. Industrial demand amounted to 2 million platinum 
ounces, 1.95 million palladium ounces and 0.16 million rhodium 
ounces.
The first half of 2016 saw moderate gains in demand for platinum 
from the industrial sector, driven by growth in new plants and 
plant expansions in the petroleum industry and by projects in 
the chemicals and glass sectors. Palladium demand during the 
first half of the year remained comparatively flat, while demand 
for rhodium was moderately higher.
Source:ImpalaPlatinumHoldingsLimited
41
increase in the platinum net position was driven by reductions in 
shorts, while the decline in the palladium net position was due 
to reductions in long positions and increased short positions on 
NYMEX. The short positioning in palladium remains high relative 
to historic levels and is expected to drive palladium prices in the 
medium term.
Outlook 
In our view, the platinum and palladium markets will remain in 
another fundamental deficit during 2016, the fifth year in a row. 
Rhodium will remain in a small fundamental surplus.
We  expect  growth  in  automotive  and  industrial  demand  for 
platinum  and  palladium,  with  relatively  flat  demand  from  the 
jewellery sector. The demand will not be fully met by primary and 
secondary supply. We expect, in the low price environment, that 
recycling will remain sluggish. In addition, primary South African 
producers now have less flexibility to supplement supplies with 
metal from stocks as these have been depleted to supplement 
cash  flows.  We  expect  diminishing  above-ground  stocks  to 
continue to satisfy fundamental deficits during 2016.
The  continued  and  growing  preference  for  palladium  over 
platinum  in  gasoline  and  diesel  catalyst  systems  remains  a 
concern.  The  current  use  on  some  gasoline  systems  is  at  a 
ratio of 7:1 Pd:Pt and higher, while global supply is at a ratio 
of around 1.2:1 Pd:Pt, a significant mismatch. Our view, and 
that of several PGM analysts, is that the palladium market will 
remain  in  a  significant  fundamental  deficit  over  the  next  10 
years. Above-ground liquid stocks and increasing autocatalyst 
recycling  are  not  expected  to  sufficiently  cover  the  deficits. 
Absent any expected increase in primary supply, the picture is 
clearly not sustainable.
Platinum
Platinum demand (excluding investment) is expected to grow 
at 1.3% in 2016 driven by modest growth in automotive and 
industrial applications, while jewellery demand is expected to 
remain relatively subdued. Primary and secondary supplies are 
not expected to fully match the growth in demand, hence we 
expect platinum to be in fundamental deficit in 2016.
Market Review (continued)
Investment
Platinum  and  palladium  exchange  traded  funds  (ETFs)  sales 
in  the  second  half  of  2015  continued  during  the  first  half  of 
2016. For platinum, the net liquidations amounted to 40 000 
ounces,  primarily  due  to  South  African  funds  liquidating  160 
000 ounces during the first half of 2016. This was on the back 
of  rand  weakness,  which  prompted  profit-taking,  with  some 
investors  swapping  into  producer  equities,  as  seen  in  share 
price gains and the high level of trading volumes during the first 
half of 2016.

There were net ETF liquidations of 130 000 palladium ounces 
during  the  first  half  of  2016.  These  liquidations  were  more 
pronounced than platinum due to concerns about the Chinese 
economy and its effect on palladium demand.

Rhodium
Growing  automotive  and  industrial  demand,  especially  in 
the  Asian  markets,  should  be  modestly  positive  for  rhodium

should keep rhodium in surplus during 2016.

Palladium
We  expect  relatively  flat  palladium  demand  during  2016 
compared to 2015, if palladium investment is excluded. As with 
platinum, primary and secondary supplies of palladium are not 
expected to meet demand, hence we expect palladium to be in 
a fundamental deficit in 2016.

Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves Summary
Geology
The 2.58 billion-year old Great Dyke is located on the Zimbabwe 
Craton  and  is  described  as  an  elongate  layered  igneous 
intrusion into the Archean granites and greenstone belts. It is a 
structure that runs along practically the full north-south axis of 
Zimbabwe, measuring approximately 550 kilometres in length 
and ranging in width from four to eleven kilometres. It is a very 
prominent feature of the geology of Zimbabwe and it outcrops 
as a series of hills on the generally flat terrain. On satellite photos 
the “concentric” elongate layered units are distinct and visible 
even to the untrained eye.
The  Great  Dyke  developed  as  a  series  of  initially  discrete 
magma chambers, which coalesced as the chambers filled. On 
the basis of structure, style of layering and continuity of layers, 
the Great Dyke has been sub-divided into five sub-chambers 
namely the Wedza, Selukwe (Shurugwi), Sebakwe, Darwendale 
and Musengezi subchambers and the stratigraphic units in each 
sub-chamber are classified into the ultramafic (lower) and the 
mafic  (upper)  sequence.  The  ultramafics  are  dominated  from 
the base upwards by dunite, harzburgite and pyroxenite while 
the mafics consist mainly of gabbro and gabbronorite. Narrow 
layers of chromitite occur at the base of cyclic units throughout 
the ultramafic sequence. The most important segment of the 
Great Dyke is the Hartley Complex which is the 100 kilometre 
long portion that straddles the boundary between the Sebakwe 
and  Darwendale  sub-chambers.  It  contains  approximately 
80  per  cent  of  the  total  PGM  resources  in  Zimbabwe.  PGM 
distribution  within  the  Hartley  Complex  is  asymmetric  with 
higher grade, narrower profiles along the western margin.
The platinum-bearing horizon is known as the Main Sulphide 
Zone (MSZ) which is part of the lower sequence and is located 
from about 5m up to 50m below the contact with the mafic 
sequence. Much of the MSZ and overlying mafic sequence have 
been eroded away and part of the Mafic sequences remain as 
the hills of the Great Dyke and outcrops of the MSZ have been 
mapped adjacent to the hills. The MSZ is a thin, continuous, 
stratiform  zone  whose  upper  layers  have  a  high  sulphide
enrichment of 2 to 8 % of iron - nickel - copper sulphides and is 
remarkably persistent in all subchambers. It occurs all along the 
Great Dyke where it overlaps the bronzitite/ websterite contact 
and ranges from 2 to 10 m thick in pyroxenite. The base of this 
nickel - copper - rich layer is straddled by a one to five metre 
thick zone of elevated precious metal values (Pt, Pd, Au, and 
Rh) and contains up to 5% disseminated sulphides while the 
sulphide content of the rest of the PGM zone is less than 0.5%. 
This drop in sulphide content with depth in the MSZ is related to 
the distribution of metal grades in the ore body so it is generally 
used as a grade marker to identify the ore zone during mining 
and exploration activities. It can normally be located visually in 
drill core and with careful observation it can also be identified 
underground.
The  experience  at  Zimplats  is  that  the  distribution  of  metal 
grades  in  the  MSZ  is  fairly  consistent  across  the  mines  and 
also on wide spaced drill holes. The Great Dyke has however 
been affected by extensive faulting of various magnitudes and 
it is important for the mining operations to locate larger faults 
ahead of mining and plan efficient strategies to mine across any 
reef displacements. Reef parallel shears can have a significant 
negative effect on the geotechnical characteristics of the rock 
including regional ground stability.
The  mineralisation  is  vertically  gradational  and  distributed 
around this high-grade pivot zone which is the marker horizon. 
The  selected  cut  on  which  Mineral  Resources  are  based  is 
determined by economic cut off within the MSZ and not based 
on a geological boundary. Given the difficulty of visually locating 
the  MSZ,  the  smaller  faults  and  related  jointing  give  rise  to 
inherent dilution of ore during mining. The effect of dilution is 
minimised because of the gentle transition from economic to sub 
economic grades especially in the footwall. Other disruptions 
to the mineralisation include post mineralisation intrusions into 
the MSZ such as large areas of disrupted metal profiles and 
washouts have been located elsewhere in the MSZ though no 
Bushveld style potholes have been mapped at Ngezi.

Mining Method
Production  at  Zimplats 
trackless  mechanised 
underground operations and one contractor operated open-pit 
mine. The four underground mines use a room and pillar mining 
method which is designed to extract ore from a 2.5 metre (m) 
cut in the production stoping sections and up to 3.5m in the 
main development roadways. The underground mines are set 
out on dips of less than 9° while the open pit is operating on 
dips  less  than  6°.  Work  is  underway  to  establish  an  equally 
efficient means of mining the resources which exceed 9° up 
to an initial target of 14° using appropriate low profile trackless 
mining machinery (TMM).
The mining envelope for the underground operations has been 
increased  from  3km  on  strike  to  6km  while  using  the  same 
equipment  and  maintaining  the  same  efficiencies  as  on  the 
shorter strike. The access declines (incline shafts) are centralised 
in each of the mines’ resource boundaries, which splits each of 
the mines into a North and South Section. The position of the 
declines is governed by the local geology and ground conditions 
therefore  there  is  invariably  some  asymmetry  between  the  2 
sections  of  the  mine  and  this  is  regularised  during  the  mine 
production sequencing and scheduling. The TMM consist of a 
low profile (LP) single boom face rig, for production drilling, and an 
LP roof bolter ,for support drilling, a 10t load and haul (LHD) and 
a 30t dump truck.
Some portals employ the use of an underground crushing plant 
and the crushed ore is conveyed to surface.
Mining operations are conducted by self–directed work teams 
(SDWT) which are allocated about twenty rooms and the total 
face length is dependent on the size (width) of the pillars and 
rooms.  This  enables  the  SDWT  to  adhere  to  a  production 
mining  cycle  consisting  of  face  drilling,  support  installation, 
loading and hauling with adequate panel redundancy to achieve 
set production targets. This also allows sufficient flexibility for 
the required grade control sampling and to negotiate faults and 
barren  intrusions  while  still  meeting  the  SDWT’s  production 
targets.  Mining  is  guided  by  face  sampling  which  is  carried 
out  using  various  methods  including  cut  channels  or  X-Ray 
fluorescence analysis at the face to allow each team to achieve 
its production target which ranges from 17 500 tonnes to 
above 20 000 tonnes of ore per month. The production targets 
are governed by face geometry, operational factors as well as 
ground conditions and the pillar layout in the particular mining 
area.  The  typical  layout  comprises  7m  panels  with  different 
sizes of in-stope pillars which are determined by depth below 
surface.  These  are  surrounded  by  large  barrier  pillars  setting 
out and 200m by 200m ‘paddock’. This pillar layout is meant 
to  contain  the  likelihood  of  cascading  pillar  failure  should  in-
stope pillars fail. Portals 1 and 2 do not have barrier pillars or 
paddocks owing to their shallow depth below surface.
At the various portals, the broken rock is either trucked out to 
a surface crusher or tipped into an underground ore pass and 
then conveyed to surface using the footwall decline conveyor.
At all the mines, the spans of rooms may decrease and pillar 
dimensions may increase in bad ground. A combination of roof 
bolts and tendons is integral to the support design.

Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves Summary (continued)
51
There has been an increase of the Mineral Resources relative to 
the 30 June 2015 position mainly as a result of the re-estimation 
of  the  Portal  6  Mineral  Resources  in  the  bankable  feasibility 
study. Overall, the  Mineral Resources marginally increased in 
tonnage by 1% while there was no change in the 4E grade.
The  numeric  modelling  exercise  carried  out  by  independent 
geotechnical  engineers  to  firm  up  on  the  pillar  layout  that 
has been adopted at the mines has been completed and the 
average ore extraction ratios of 66% at Mupfuti Mine and 68% 
at Bimha Mine will continue to apply. The new pillar layouts will 
also be applied to mine designs for new projects.
Ore  Reserves  for  Portal  4N  (formerly  Portal  5S),  which  had 
been  excluded  in  the  June  2015  statement  to  enable  the 
completion  of  geotechnical  investigations  that  would  lead  to 
a revision of mine design based on a new pillar layout, have 
been  re-included  in  this  statement.  The  conclusion  of  the 
geotechnical  investigations  has  also  enabled  a  return  to  the 
policy of converting all measured Mineral Resources at Bimha 
and  Mupfuti  mines  to  proved  Ore  Reserves  while  converting 
the indicated Mineral Resources in these areas to probable Ore 
Reserves. Overall, the Ore Reserves increased in tonnage by 
38% while the 4E grade decreased by 1%.
Assurance                                                  
The Mineral Corporation has undertaken an audit of Zimplats 
as part of the Implats group-wide Mineral Resources and Ore 
Reserves statement, as at 30 June 2016. A review of Zimplats’ 
policies  and  procedures  with  respect  to  the  estimation 
and  reporting  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Ore  Reserves  was 
undertaken as well as audits to assess adherence of the Portal 6 
Mineral Resources estimates to these policies and procedures. 
The Mineral Corporation then reviewed the consolidated Mineral 
Resources  and  Ore  Reserves  statements  for  Zimplats.  The 
Mineral Corporation concluded that Zimplats has demonstrated 
to their satisfaction that the Company policies and procedures, 
if followed, would result in the reporting of Mineral Resources 
and Ore Reserves estimates which are compliant with the 2012 
Edition of the JORC Code. No material issues were identified 
in the audits and hence The Mineral Corporation is of the view 
that  Zimplats’  policies  and  procedures  have  been  followed. 
The  Mineral  Resources  estimates  satisfy  the  JORC  Code
requirement  for  reasonable  prospects  for  eventual  economic 
extraction.  The  Ore  Reserves  estimates  are  based  on  life  of 
mine  plans,  with  their  extraction  having  been  demonstrated 
to be financially viable and justifiable under a set of realistically 
assumed  production  levels,  modifying  factors  and  economic 
inputs.  There  were  no  issues  identified  in  the  source  and 
consolidated statements in relation to summation, rounding off 
and presentation of the estimates.
Notes
•
Mineral Resources tonnages and grades are estimated in 
situ over a minimum mining width. Measured and Indicated 
Mineral Resources are reported inclusive of those Mineral 
Resources modified to produce Ore Reserves.
 Historical statistics are used as the basis of the unavoidable 
dilution to the mine grades and the Ore Reserves figures are 
estimated based on the diluted grades.
 Day to day operations are monitored using in-house lead 
collector fire assays with AA finish. The Mineral Resources 
and Ore Reserves in this statement are based largely on 
Genalysis  nickel  sulphide  collector  fire  assays  with  ICP-
MS  finish.  The  differences  between  the  methods  are 
incorporated within the modifying factors that have been 
applied, which means that there may be slight distortions in 
recovery and other parameters.
 The main grade interpolation methodology utilised Kriging 
techniques  on  data  derived  from  surface  diamond  drill 
holes.  Estimates  are  based  on  composite  widths  that 
vary  depending  on  cut  off  grades,  which  are  based  on 
appropriate economic conditions.
 The  boundaries  of  the  ore  envelope  are  gradational, 
particularly  in  the  footwall,  so  the  choice  of  mining  cut 
is  affected  by  economic  factors.  The  price  of  the  suite 
of  metals  that  is  produced  from  the  MSZ  has  fluctuated 
considerably in the last few years. It is, however, believed 
that the choice of mining cut is robust under a wide range 
of pricing conditions. 
 Estimates are produced in accordance with Implats’ group-
wide protocol for the estimation, classification and reporting 
of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves. The objectives of 
the code are to improve standardisation, consistency and 
to facilitate auditing.
 The maximum depth of these resources is 1 250m and no

part is more than 5km down dip from outcrop; therefore 
any part is theoretically accessible to mining within a 10 to 
15 year time frame.
 The Zimplats operations are entitled to mine all declared 
Mineral  Resources  located  under  Special  Mining  Lease 
1  and  all  necessary  statutory  mining  authorisation  and 
permits are in place. The first tenure of 25 years will expire 
in 2019. The agreement allows for two extensions of ten 
years each.
 In March 2013, the Government of Zimbabwe gazetted a 
preliminary notice of its intention to compulsorily acquire a 
large portion of ground (measuring 27 948 hectares) held 
under the operating subsidiary’s special mining lease and 
situated on the North of Portal 10 which amounts to 54.6 
Moz Pt. In March 2013 the operating subsidiary lodged a 
formal objection to the preliminary notice to compulsorily 
acquire the land. From June 2015 the operating subsidiary 
was  actively  engaged  in  discussions  with  the  Ministry 
of  Mines  and  Mining  Development  in  an  endeavour  to 
resolve  the  matter  amicably.  However,  on  29  June  2016 
the  operating  subsidiary  was  served  with  an  application 
filed in the Administrative Court of Zimbabwe in which the 
Government of Zimbabwe is seeking an order authorising 
the acquisition by the Government of Zimbabwe of the land 
described in the preliminary notice referred to above. The 
Company was cited as the respondent in the application. 
Papers  opposing  the  application  were  filed  on  behalf  of 
the Company and the operating subsidiary. The matter is 
therefore pending in the Administrative Court of Zimbabwe. 
The operating subsidiary will however still seek to have the 
matter  resolved  amicably.  Depending  on  the  outcome  of 
the matter in the Administrative Court, or the outcome of 
any further discussions that the operating subsidiary may 
have with the Government of Zimbabwe on the matter, the 
Zimplats Mineral Resources may be significantly reduced. 
 Zimplats operations have documented the guidelines and

modifying  factors  that  underpin  the  life-of-mine  (LOM) 
plans which are supported by mine designs and production 
schedules. 
 The Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves tabulated in this 
report are estimates and not calculations. They are subject 
to a wide range of factors, some of which are outside the 
Company’s control, which include:-
   The quality and quantity of available data. Estimates are 
based  on  limited  sampling  and,  consequently,  there  is 
uncertainty as the samples may not be representative of 
the entire ore body and Mineral Resources.
  The quality of the methodologies employed.
  Economic conditions and commodity prices.
 Geological interpretation and the judgment of the individuals 
involved. Changes in these factors along with developments 
in the understanding of the ore body and changes in recovery 
rates,  production  costs  and  other  factors  may  ultimately 
result  in  a  restatement  of  Ore  Reserves  and/or  Mineral 
Resources and may adversely impact future cash flows.
 To mitigate this risk, the Company appoints independent 
third  parties  to  review  the  Mineral  Resources  and  Ore 
Reserves estimates on a regular basis and mining project 
feasibilities studies are subject to independent review prior 
to applying to the board for capital approval.
 Rounding-off of numbers may result in minor computational 
discrepancies.

Sustainability Matters
Management approach
The sustainability programme upon which Zimplats’ business is anchored has economic, social and environmental considerations as 
the three pillars of strategic focus. Success in these three strategic areas ensures sustainable symbiotic relationships between the 
organisation, its communities and ecosystems.
 
This sustainability report addresses the key tenets of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G4 guidelines as detailed in the GRI index 
provided on page 158. Zimplats has prepared the sustainability report in accordance with the GRI G4 “Core” reporting guidelines. 
Selected key performance information has been independently assured (limited assurance basis) by EY on pages 162 to 165. The 
symbol (
) denotes performance information that has been independently assured by EY (limited assurance basis).
Sustainability performance data
The data in this report is based on the Group’s records and prioritised on the basis of the risk register and key outcomes of the 
stakeholders engagement report.

Sustainability Matters (continued)
Strategic objectives
The strategy is driven through seven pillars (strategic objectives) 
that  are  anchored  on  sound  risk  management  practices. 
Because  of  the  dynamic  internal  and  external  environment 
under  which  the  business  operates,  success  of  the  strategy 
requires  a  continuous  review  and  evaluation  of  these  seven 
strategic objectives individually and as a whole. The strategic 
objectives are:
•  Relentlessly drive the safety of our people
•  Consistently deliver production volumes and grade
•  Continually improve operational efficiency
•  Manage costs and wisely preserve cash
•  Delivery of capital projects on time and within budget
•
Retention of critical skills and developing our people to be 
world class champions
•
Business sustainability driven by the desire to be a good 
corporate citizen
Our approach to risk management
An enterprise risk management (ERM) framework has been 
established  to  address  strategic,  operational,  legal  and 
compliance risks inherent in the business. Risk management, 
together with an effective internal control framework helps 
management focus on operations, stakeholder management, 
safety, health environment and sustainability.
The risk management framework is premised on the ISO 31000 
standard depicted below:

Sustainability Matters (continued)
Effective risk management underpins the delivery of our strategic objectives and the framework that we have developed for managing 
risks assists us to identify key risks at an early stage and develop actions to eliminate them or mitigate their impact and likelihood to 
an acceptable level.
Governance structure of risk management
Under the business management systems policy, the Group has established an integrated risk management system that mandates all 
employees and contractors to acknowledge and manage specific risks inherent in their daily work. In addition the board has tasked 
each of its committees, that is, the audit and risk committee, the remuneration committee (REMCO) and the safety, health, environment 
and community (SHEC) committee, responsibilities for oversight and monitoring of risk management activities by management. These 
are shown in the risk governance structure below:

Responsible for our system of corporate governance, strategy, risk management and ﬁnancial 
performance.
Responsible for reviewing and approving the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management and 
internal control systems.
Reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of management of risks associated with safety, health, 
environment, corporate social responsibility and sustainability.
Monitor trends in the Group and Industry’s salary and bonus structures, policies and practices. Monitor

Responsible for identifying, assessing and managing risks within their businesses.
Adhering to risk management policies and procedures, implementation of prescribed 
risk mitigation actions and reporting risk events and incidents timeously.
Our risk reporting system
An  IsoMetrix  system  has  been  established  for  capturing, 
analysing  and  reporting  all  operational  risks  covering  safety, 
health  and  environment  (SHE)  while  the  Cura  system  has 
been retained to cover strategic risks. IsoMetrix tracks all SHE 
incidents and action plans developed to manage the risks as 
well as act as a database for all SHE baseline risk assessments.
 
Cura  provides  a  depository  of  all  strategic  risks,  identified 
control  measures,  individuals  assigned  with  the  responsibility 
to  accomplish  the  control  measures  and  their  performance 
monitoring and control.
Various risk reports, dashboards and risk management protocols 
are drawn from the system for the board’s attention. The board
has analysed all the risk reports submitted from various sources 
and  concluded  that  the  Group  has  maintained  sound  risk 
management and internal control systems throughout the year 
and has reviewed their adequacy and effectiveness.
Our key strategic risks 
Strategic  risks  are  any  events,  occurrences  or  incidents  that 
may  occur  that  have  the  potential  to  materially  affect  the 
achievement of strategic objectives of the Group. Depressed 
metal  prices  have  remained  the  top  risk  for  the  Group 
throughout the financial period under review.  A new set of risks 
that featured in the top 20 strategic risks includes the smelter 
operations risks as well as risk of failure of the tailings storage 
facilities particularly at our SMC plant. These and some risks 
in the top 20 group risk profile are detailed in the table below:

Our operational risk management 
During  the  period  (FY2016),  the  International  Mining  Industry 
Underwriters (IMIU) conducted an operational risk assessment 
at  both  the  mining  and  processing  operations.  The  IMIU 
assessors  were  satisfied  with  the  effectiveness  of  control 
measures 
implemented  at 
international  standards  (including  after  the  collapse  of  Bimha 
Mine)  and  rated  the  operation  as  a  moderate  to  low  risk. 
Consequently, the Group was able to retain the high percentage 
risk reduction adopted rating.
 
Having identified underground fire risk as a top operational risk, 
all underground conveyor belts were replaced with F-Type belts 
that have fire retardant characteristics.

Materiality and stakeholder engagement
Management approach
The  Group  acknowledges 
its  key 
stakeholders  and  the  impact  that  they  may  have  on  the 
business or alternatively the impact that the Group may have 
on the stakeholders. To this end, stakeholder engagement is 
an  integral  part  of  business  operations  and  it  is  essential  in 
managing risk and building social capital. The Group recognises 
and works with both internal and external stakeholders.
Key stakeholders
Zimplats’  internal  stakeholders  are  employees,  management 
and  shareholders  while  external  stakeholders 
include 
communities, regulatory authorities, suppliers, local authorities,
60
Sustainability Matters (continued)
government,  media,  financial  institutions  and  analysts  and 
lobby groups. Identification of stakeholders is achieved through 
a process of assessing how they impact on the Group both 
directly and indirectly. Consideration is also given as to whether 
the Group impacts on them directly or indirectly. Prioritisation of 
stakeholders is done following the Group’s strategic objectives 
and risk register.
To identify its material issues, Zimplats uses a wide range of
criteria, processes and stakeholder engagements. Stakeholder 
engagement allows the Group to understand and respond to 
stakeholder  expectations.  All  material  issues  identified  during 
engagement are captured and action plans are put in place to 
address the issues.
The table below lists some of the key stakeholders identified using 
the  stakeholder  prioritisation  method  and  the  material  issues 
relevant to the Group that came out of the engagement process 
and the action taken.

Local enterprise development
Rubwe silica mine
Communities and community social investment
Developing  partnerships  with  communities  around  our 
operations  is  one  of  Zimplats’  strategic  objectives  under 
management of enterprise risk.
Zimplats’ strategy with regards to community engagement is 
informed by the research findings mainly from the perception 
and baseline studies and quarterly stakeholder meetings that 
include community leaders and local chiefs.
Key perceptions that came out of that study include the need 
for Zimplats to address the following:
•  Continued investment  in community development initiatives
• 
 Consideration of opportunities for greater direct engagement 
with the community
 Consideration of investment in more infrastructural projects 
unrelated to the Group’s operations.
•
The community also identified and ranked their key development 
needs,  including  the  need  for  the  promotion  of  income 
generating activities to address poverty at household level.
A community development plan is being implemented with the 
following objectives:
•  addressing community concerns
•  alleviating poverty through local enterprise development
•  enhancing infrastructure relating to education and health 
•
improving relations between Zimplats and the surrounding 
communities

development project that will benefit communities in two wards 
adjacent to Zimplats’ operations in Ngezi.
The project aims to improve genetics as well as the health of the 
herd and ultimately to contribute towards household nutrition 
and income generation.
Education
The  Company  continues  to  support  educational  activities  in  the 
communities and in FY2016 this included structural repairs and 
supply of computers at Mutukwa School in Mhondoro.
Health
Zimplats has assisted the community to complete and equip 
a maternity ward as well as the supply of piped water at Gora 
Clinic  in  Mhondoro  Mubaira.  Financial  assistance  was  also 
given  to  St  Michael’s  Hospital,  located  in  Mhondoro  Ngezi 
and the purchase of sunglasses, sun screen lotions and other 
medical accessories for children living with albinism.
Turf community stadium (Baobab stadium)
The Company constructed a community sports stadium at Turf 
in Ngezi.
Settlers within Zimplats’ special mining lease area 
There  are  31  families  settled  without  the  necessary  authority 
within  Zimplats’  special  mining  lease  area  in  Ngezi.  Dialogue 
with the affected families to vacate the area to make way for 
new mining projects has failed. As a result, Zimplats has handed 
over the matter to the authorities who have in turn referred the 
matter to the courts.
There are also 20 families settled within the Selous Metallurgical 
Complex  tailings  dam  zone  of  influence.  Zimplats  is  working 
with the authorities to identify land for the safe resettlement of 
these families
Community share ownership trust
The now well established Zimplats Mhondoro Ngezi Chegutu 
Zvimba Community Share Ownership Trust (CSOT) continued 
with  its  community  development  programme  with  more  than 
100  projects  at  various  stages  of  implementation.  Since 
inception in October 2011, the CSOT has implemented grass 
roots driven projects valued at more than US$5 million from the 
US$10 million donation made to it by the Group.
The CSOT is now focusing on implementing income generating 
projects to ensure continuity.

Safety
The Company is on track in its quest for zero harm with several 
improvements and achievements registered in FY2016. There 
was a significant reduction in the number and severity of injuries 
incurred during the year. There was also a significant drop in 
the number of incidents involving trackless mining equipment 
during the same period.
Management approach
The  approach  to  safety  management  follows  the  Business 
Management System (BMS) that is anchored on the following 
international standards:
•  Quality Management System - ISO 9 001
•  Environmental Management System - ISO 14 001
•  Safety and Health Management System - OHSAS 18 001
•  Laboratory Accreditation System – ISO 17025
Safety performance
The  Group  recorded  a  significant  improvement  in  safety 
performance  in  FY2016  compared  to  the  previous  year. 
Applying  the  revised  FY2016  reporting  definitions  for  LTIs 
and LTIFR – refer to page 2 of this report: the lost time injury 
frequency rate (LTIFR) that measures the number of lost time 
injuries  per  million  man-hours,  decreased  by  34%  from  0.88 
in FY2015 to 0.58  in FY2016, and the total injury frequency 
rate (TIFR) decreased by 24% from 1.33 in FY2015 to 1.01  in 
FY2016. There were no  fatalities during the year and the Group 
achieved five million fatality free shifts in June 2016.
The following graphs show the improved safety performance 
during the year.

management  system  was  to  retain  ISO14001  certification 
status and commence upgrading the EMS to ISO 14001:2015 
standard.  DQS  Management  Systems  auditors  conducted 
an  ISO14001:2004  surveillance  audit  during  the  period.  No 
major  non-conformities  were  raised.  Review  of  procedures 
aligning  them  to  the  new  standard  commenced.  In  line  with 
our commitment to continual improvement, we have enhanced 
and aligned the IsoMetrix system to the new ISO 14001:2015 
standard.
Focus  for  FY2017  -  Our  plan  is  to  align  our  environmental 
management  system  to  the  new  standard  (ISO  14001:2015) 
by end of FY2017
Water Stewardship
The  Group  uses  water  at  each  stage  in  mineral  extraction 
and  processing  and  acknowledges  that  water  has  to  be 
used responsibly. Our operations in Ngezi and SMC have two 
different  catchments  which  have  different  sets  of  water  risks 
and opportunities. The Group also monitors water use, demand 
and supply as well as environmental legislation relating to water.

The total raw water abstracted from dams in FY2016 amounted to 5 569ML compared to 4 106ML for the previous year. The amount of 
water abstracted from dams increased by 36% due to low volumes of recycled water. A total of 4 218ML of recycled water was used and 
this represents 34.8% of the total water used compared to 39.9% recycled in FY2015. The hot and dry weather conditions experienced 
during the year negatively affected water recycling performance. Water losses were experienced at Ngezi tailings storage facility due to 
tailings deposition on new ground. Consequently, total water consumption amounted to 12 121ML up from 10 725 ML for the previous year.

Plan for FY2017 - Our plan is to continue with effluent recycling 
initiatives to achieve 40% recycling for the operation. In line with 
this  thrust  we  will  explore  opportunities  for  recycling  treated 
effluent from Turf town.
Management approach to climate change
The  Group  is  committed  to  reducing  carbon  emissions 
emanating from both direct and indirect emissions. The carbon 
footprints include scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon emissions. Scope 
1 emissions are direct emissions from the use of fuel and coal, 
whilst scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from purchased 
electricity.  Scope  3  emissions  result  from  indirect  emissions 
from business travel. Total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for 
FY2016 amounted to 375 726 tonnes compared to 335 258 
tonnes reported in the previous year. An increase in the absolute 
CO2 emitted is attributed to increased production in the current 
year compared to FY2015. Our relative carbon emissions stood 
at 0.059  per tonne of ore reflecting an improved performance 
from 0.065 tonnes of CO2 emitted per tonne milled. The bulk 
of  our  emissions  (87%)  fall  under  scope  2  emissions  and  the 
remainder 13% arise from burning fossil fuels, diesel, petrol and 
coal.

The approach to climate change is underpinned by the need 
to accelerate efforts to drive energy efficient initiatives. Some 
of  these  initiatives  were  implemented  during  FY2016  include 
energy efficient equipment and lighting, power factor correction 
and solar water heating. Energy efficient improvement projects 
were  implemented  as  part  of  our  climate  change  response 
strategy.    A  total  37  energy  efficient  electric  motors  were 
installed  during  FY2016.  The  new  motors  are  specified  IE3 
which is the latest generation of premium efficiency motors.
Since  inception  of  the  energy  efficient  lighting  programme  in 
February 2014, a total of 2 884 megawatt-hours (MWh) were 
saved. FY2016 annualised savings amounted to 1 387 MWh. 
Installation of energy efficient motors resulted in total savings 
of  8  268MWh  in  FY2016  up  from  6  841MWh  in  FY2015. 
Other  initiatives  which  include  load  scheduling,  power  factor 
correction and transformer tap setting reduction resulted in total 
savings of 6 841MWh. The combined tonnes of CO2 emission 
savings  achieved  as  a  result  of  implementation  of  energy 
efficient programmes is 16 391 tonnes of carbon dioxide.
Total energy consumption for FY2016 was 0.38  Giga joules per 
tonne (GJ/tonne) compared to 0.42 GJ/tonne for the previous year.

Plan  for  FY2017  -  Our  thrust  is  to  continue  implementing 
energy efficient programmes to reduce  CO2 emissions.
A total of US$0.93 million is included in the FY2017 budget for 
the energy efficient electric motors installation.
Land stewardship 
The  approach  to  managing  mining  and  processing  impacts 
on  land  and  biodiversity  is  the  on-going  rehabilitation  of 
open-pits, tailings storage facilities new risings and any other 
disturbed areas. The rehabilitation approach is consistent with 
the  pre-disturbance  land  use  taking  into  account  regulatory 
requirements and stakeholder expectations. As at the end of 
FY2016,  old  open-pits  rehabilitation/  backfilling  had  a  total 
of 237 066 loose cubic meters (LCM) moved. This was 36% 
below our plan due to temporary reassignment of rehabilitation 
equipment  and  team  to  other  critical  tasks.  Project  to  date 
LCM moved amounted to 1 940 394 LCM reflecting 78% of 
work  done  at  a  total  cost  of  US$3.5  million.  In-pit  dumping 
commenced at the active South Pit Mine with a total of 1 157 
213 bulk cubic meters (BCM) having been backfilled as part 
of the progressive rehabilitation plan. Progressive rehabilitation 
of the South Pit Mine will continue during the life of the open-
pit operation. This reduces the overall liability for rehabilitation 
works particularly decommissioning of the open-pit.
This item was the subject of the limited assurance engagement performed by EY.
The  total  area  re-vegetated  on  the  tailings  storage  facilities 
(TSF)  is  16  hectares,  up  from  2.5  hectares  for  FY2015.  This 
is  attributed  to  an  increase  in  areas  requiring  tree  and  grass 
planting at Ngezi tailings storage facility. A total of 2 450 trees 
were planted at the two TSF during FY2016 planting season. 
The progressive re-vegetation of the TSF increases stability of the 
slopes, prevents erosion and dust generation at the same time 
restoring vegetation which existed before the construction of the 
facilities as local provenance species of native plants are planted.

Eradication of the invasive species, lantana camara, was also 
undertaken  during  the  year.  This  is  part  of  our  commitment 
to maintaining stable ecosystems in areas we operate at the 
same time complying with the Environmental Management Act 
(Chapter 20: 27) and its ecosystems protection regulations.
A  closure  liability  estimation  exercise  was  undertaken  during 
the  year.  The  Company  recognise  the  risks  associated  with 
ineffective  closure  and  seeks  to  reduce  these  through  the 
closure governance framework. Information on closure liability 
provisions can be found under the environmental rehabilitation 
provision disclosures in the financial statements.
Rehabilitation focus for FY2017 and beyond - Our focus 
for FY2017 is to continue with the Ngezi open-pit rehabilitation 
programme and achieve  FY2017 budget. Our plan is to plant 
500 indigenous trees on backfilled open pit areas.
TSF tree and grass planting will continue in FY2017. Our focus is 
on revegitating 50 hectares at Ngezi  TSF and 1 hectare at SMC.
Eradication of invasive/alien species (lantana camara) encroaching 
into our operations will continue in FY2017 and beyond. 
Zimplats intends to review and update  closure and rehabilitation 
plans  in  line  with  the  changes  taking  place  in  the  existing 
operations.
Waste management
The Company’s waste management strategy seeks to ensure 
compliance with the Environmental Management Act (Chapter 
20: 27) and its regulations pertaining to waste generated from 
mining  and  processing  activities.  In  line  with  this  strategy, 
waste  management  plans  were  compiled  and  submitted  to 
the Environmental Management Agency. Solid waste licences 
were also renewed. Waste recycling is being done as part of 
our commitment to reduce waste disposal. In 2016, a total of 
1  718  tonnes  of  scrap  metal  were  sent  off-site  for  recycling 
compared  to  981  tonnes  in  the  previous  year.  Waste  paper 
recycling  is  being  promoted  and  a  total  of  10  waste  paper 
and plastics storage cages were erected to temporarily store 
the  waste  pending  transportation  to  recycling  companies. 
Trials on a vermiculture project which involves compositing of 
biodegradable waste commenced at one of our operations and 
these trials will be continued in FY2017.
Plan  for  FY2017  -    Zimplats  will  explore  options  for  the 
disposal  of  old  Base  Metal  Refinery  chemicals.  Engagement 
with the Environemtal Management Agency commenced and 
will continue until the best disposal options are established
The organisation will continue with the investigations of options 
for the disposal of scrap trackless mining equipment. 
Trials  for  a  vermiculture  project  to  compost  biodegradable 
waste will continue in FY2017.
Air quality management
The  Company’s`  most  significant  air  quality  environmental 
aspect relates to SO2 emissions from the smelting operations. 
All  point  source  air  emissions  discharge  points  are  licensed 
by  the  Environmental  Management  Agency  in  line  with 
environmental  regulations  on  air  emissions.  SO2  emission 
reduction  feasibility  studies  commenced  in  the  previous  year 
and  continued  in  FY2016.  Air  dispersion  models  were  also 
undertaken as part of the feasibility studies. The operation is 
pursuing  the  extension  of  its  smelter  chimney  stack,  with  a 
view  to  improving  air  dispersion  and  minimising  ground  level 
emission levels. In the longer-term, the installation of an acid 
plant is planned to ensure both smelter stack point source and 
ground level concentrations around the SMC communities fall 
within acceptable limits.
Human Resources
Management approach
The people management approach to human resources aims 
to  ensure  that  we  acquire  and  retain  the  best  possible  skills 
which we can deploy safely and efficiently.  We promote the 
ideals  of  a  learning  organisation  and  promote  a  harmonious 
working environment characterised by growth, fair reward and 
positive employee engagement.
Our values of care, respect and deliver form the basis of our 
people  management  practices.  Accordingly,  the  following 
continue to act as the core pillars of our people strategy;
  Developing our leadership capacity.
  Continuous improvement in our systems effectiveness.
Communication  enhancement  to  promote  open  and 
positive employee engagement.
  Talent management to ensure the best possible deployment 
of our skills.
A strong culture based on our values.

CULTURE
The  year  under  review  was  characterised  by  positive  and 
harmonious  employee  relations.  The  Group’s  employee 
engagement platforms continue to function well thereby enabling 
an environment of open two-way communication.
The  operating  subsidiary  concluded  a  retrenchment  exercise 
at  supervisory  and  management  levels  during  the  period 
under  review.  This  exercise,  in  conjunction  with  other  labour 
rationalisation  initiatives,  resulted  in  significant  savings  in 
employment costs.
The  Group’s  labour  turnover  increased  slightly  from  4.3%  in 
the prior year to 6.3% in the year under review. The increase 
was caused by a combination of retrenchments and medical 
retirements. Consequently, Zimplats own employees’ headcount 
decreased by 6% from the prior year to close the year at 3 047 
employees. Turnover in the coming year is projected to reduce 
as no further labour rationalisation is anticipated at this stage.
The  resourcing  of  institutions  of  tertiary  education  remains 
below  par  and  consequently,  the  Group  continues  to  invest 
in the resourcing of tertiary institutions. Of key note this year 
was the Group’s sponsorship of a professorial chair in mining 
engineering at the University of Zimbabwe.
The  contractor  headcount  decreased  by  8%  from  prior  year 
to  2,397  and  of  this  total,  89%  were  operating  expenditure 
(opex) contractors and 11% were capital expenditure (capex) 
contractors. In operations, contractors were mainly engaged for 
the open pit mining activities and Bimha Mine redevelopment. 
Contractors  are  defined  as  non-permanent  employees  who 
are contracted directly by the Company for a fixed term and/
or  those  employees  working  for  third  parties  that  have  been 
contracted by the Company for specific projects. It is conditional 
for  companies  contracted  to  the  Group  to  practise  fair  and 
equitable  labour  standards  in  line  with  our  values  towards 
people management.

Strategic approach to wellness
The  Group  believes  that  total  wellness  is  essential  in  order 
for  our  people  to  enjoy  a  healthy  life  and  to  be  meaningfully 
productive at work. The Group therefore seeks to reinforce the 
Group’s wellness programmes in order to enhance employee 
total wellbeing and productivity in line with goal number three of 
the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
To encourage and promote personal health and wellness 
among employees, their dependents and the community. 
 To support employees and their dependents in managing 
personal stress and mental health.
 To ensure disease prevention awareness among employees 
and their dependents.
 To  include  the  surrounding  communities  in  the  thrust  to 
manage NCDs.
 To  strengthen  programmes  for  effective  management  of 
sexually transmitted infections (STI), HIV and AIDS.

Disease prevention education continued with no outbreak 
reported during FY2016.
 The Company won the 2016 Zimbabwe National Chamber 
of Commerce (ZNCC) Best Corporate Social Responsibility 
award in the field of HIV awareness.
Occupational health surveillance
The level of compliance with respect to red ticket applications 
remains excellent.
There were two  cases of pneumoconiosis during the period 
under review.
Noise induced hearing loss (NIHL)
No   cases  of  NIHL  were  recorded  during  the  year.  This 
represents a significant improvement compared to seven cases 
recorded last year. The hearing conservation programme shall 
continue to receive full attention in order to minimise cases of 
NIHL.
Counselling and health education is offered to employees who 
experience percentage loss hearing (PLH). These are placed on 
a bi-annual monitoring programme to track any deterioration of 
their hearing abilities.
Engineering and other controls are being put in place to mitigate 
the incidence of NIHL.
Biological monitoring
Monitoring  of  employees  and  contractors  exposed  to  lead 
continued with a total of 72 employees and contractors being 
tested during the year.  No cases of abnormal lead levels were 
identified during the period.
Tuberculosis
Screening of both presumptive and contact cases was carried 
out  during  the  year.  Confirmed  cases  were  commenced  on 
treatment  using  Ministry  of  Health  and  Child  Care  guidelines. 
These cases were notified to the health ministry and reported to 
NSSA for compensation purposes and statistics. Contact tracing 
includes employees in the same work team as the index case.

Malaria
All malaria cases that were treated at the operating subsidiary’s facilities gave a positive history of prior travel to malaria endemic 
areas. From the five rapid test positive malaria cases, four were from the mining division while one was from the processing division. 
Contractor employees accounted for four cases and one was a Zimplats employee. This bears testimony to the effectiveness of our 
internal malaria programme with no cases of local transmission recorded in the year.
HIV and AIDS
HIV and AIDS awareness campaigns aimed at employees, dependents and the community were run throughout the year. The number 
of new anti-retroviral treatment initiation stood at 30 for FY2016. A total of 12 anti-retro viral treatment (ART) terminations for various 
reasons were recorded. There were no AIDS related deaths during the year.
Interventions to address STIs included discussions at SHEQ and works council meetings. A questionnaire survey and focus group 
discussions covering employees, spouses and commercial sex workers were also carried out. The recommended actions from these 
engagements formed the basis of some of the FY2017 action plans.
In recognition of the Company’s achievements in the on-going work in the area of HIV and AIDS, the operating subsidiary was awarded 
the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce Best Corporate Social Responsibility - HIV Awareness Award 2016.

Voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) uptake
The number of employees and dependents who underwent VCT in FY2016 was lower in comparison to FY2015. This is partly due to 
the fact that the programme is now being run biannually as compared to quarterly in the previous years. The VCT programme is run 
through an external partner. Uptake of VCT using internal resources remains very low.

The focus on NCDs has been elevated in response to current disease trends where the re-emergence of NCDs poses a major health 
threat to the Group and Zimbabwe. An all-encompassing wellness policy has been drafted which is expected to guide the implementation 
of the Group’s wellness programme. Information on these conditions is disseminated through bulletins, commemorations and through 
wellness champions during departmental talks. Health officers also take turns to visit the operations disseminating information on NCD’s.
Employee welfare
In  line  with  the  national  thrust  towards  housing  the  Group  remains  committed  to  ensuring  that  all  employees  live  in  decent 
accommodation. Due to funding challenges, the Group’s housing delivery programme was slower than desired. Low cost housing 
solutions have been pursued and it is anticipated that housing delivery under the home ownership scheme will recommence in the 
short to medium term.

Corporate Governance Report
The King III Report on Corporate Governance (King III) applicable to South African companies requires those entities to comply with 
the King III recommendations with effect from March 2010.
Implats holds 87% of the Company’s issued shares. As a foreign subsidiary of a South African company, King III requires that Zimplats 
considers and, where practicable, implements the recommendations made in the report with an ‘apply or explain’ approach.
Where appropriate, non-compliance has been disclosed and explained in this report. Essentially the King III recommendations place 
additional responsibilities on the board, management and stakeholders as well as expanding the extent of disclosures in the integrated 
annual report, giving greater credence to transparency.
The  Company  also  has  an  obligation  to  comply  with  the  requirements  of  the  ASX  Corporate  Governance  Principles  and 
Recommendations, Third Edition. The Company has complied with the requirements of the ASX Corporate Governance Principles 
and Recommendations, except were explanations have been provided.
Wherever practicable and appropriate, and considering the nature and scale of operations, the Company will consider and, if deemed 
appropriate, adopt the governance and compliance policies of the controlling shareholder, with suitable modifications.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The board of directors is cognisant of the important role that corporate governance plays in the delivery of sustainable growth, and 
fully supports the highest levels of governance standards by ensuring that solid and sustainable governance processes and structures 
are in place.
The board is committed to the principles of openness, integrity and accountability in dealing with all stakeholders. In this regard, the 
board believes that for the full duration of the period under review the Company’s policies and practices have complied in all material 
respects with corporate governance ‘best practice’, including the King III principles and the ASX Corporate Governance Principles and 
Recommendations, Third Edition, except as stated herein. Non-executive directors are paid a cash fee only and they do not receive any 
equity based remuneration, bonus payments or retirement benefits. Recommendation 8.3 ASX Corporate Governance Principles and 
Recommendations is therefore not applicable.
The board fully recognises its responsibilities for setting the Company’s strategic direction, providing the leadership to put this into 
effect, supervising the management of the business and reporting to the shareholders on its stewardship. The board meets at least six 
times a year. Apart from the four quarterly board meetings, a strategy planning session is held annually with the executive management 
team and a separate meeting is devoted to reviewing the annual budget and business plan. One-third of the board members retire by 
rotation at the annual general meeting of the Company, and members may put themselves forward for re-election.
The responsibilities of the board are defined in a board charter, which defines the rights, obligations, responsibilities and powers of 
the board. A board approval framework is in place, which identifies materiality thresholds on matters delegated by the board to board 
committees and senior executives, in addition to those matters reserved for the board. The Company has a written agreement with 
each director and senior executive setting the terms of their appointment.
81
Corporate Governance Report (continued)
In order for the board of directors to discharge its responsibilities in setting strategic direction and providing leadership, the board has 
established the following committees:
•  audit and risk committee
• 
remuneration committee
•  safety, health, environment and community (SHEC) committee.
The chairpersons of each of these committees are encouraged to attend the annual general meeting to answer questions from 
shareholders. Each committee chairperson reports on the proceedings of his/her committee at the quarterly board meetings.
These committees operate under board approved terms of reference which are reviewed by the board annually and which have been 
amended to take into account the requirements of King III, and which set out the role, responsibilities, scope of authority, composition 
and procedures for reporting to the board.
The  board  considered  appointing  a  nominations  committee  to  help  ensure  that  the  effectiveness  and  composition  of  the  board 
and its committees are regularly reviewed, meet sound governance dictates and comprise the requisite mix of skills. With an 87% 
controlling shareholding, board nominations are the prerogative of Implats, which itself has a rigorous nominations procedure to which 
Zimplats nominees are subjected. Therefore, the board considers it unnecessary to form a separate committee. The Company does 
not therefore fully meet the requirements of either King III or Recommendation 2.1 of the ASX Corporate Governance Principles and 
Recommendations with regard to the appointment of a nominations committee.
From a corporate governance perspective, Implats has the right to nominate a majority of directors. It is for this reason that the 
Company does not meet the requirements of either King III or Recommendation 2.4 of the ASX Corporate Governance Principles 
and Recommendations, which stipulate that the majority of directors should be independent. Details of board members appear on 
pages 28 to 31. The board has a programme for inducting  new directors in order to familiarise them with the Zimplats operations, its 
business environment and the sustainability issues relevant to the business.
The board currently comprises ten members, made up as follows:

Dr F S Mufamadi, a non-executive director, was appointed as chairman with effect from 1 July 2015. Mr A Mhembere is an executive 
director and the chief executive officer. The roles of the chairman and chief executive officer are therefore distinctly separate. The 
chairman however is not independent as he is an Implats nominee. In this regard, the Company does not therefore fully meet the 
requirements of either King III or Recommendation 2.5 of the ASX Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations.

Ap = Apology
The board has in place a process of board and retiring director performance evaluations. The evaluation cycle adopted is every two years 
as opposed to annually as recommended by King III as the board considers that the extended period between evaluations will allow for a 
more reasonable assessment of performance. In line with the evaluation cycle, evaluations were undertaken in the first quarter of FY2016. 
There were no material issues arising from the evaluations.
CL Secretaries Limited, a company incorporated in Gurnsey, is the Company secretary. CL Secretaries Limited is accountable to the 
board, through the chairman, on matters to do with the proper functioning of the board.
BOARD COMMITTEES
AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE
The board considers that a separate risk committee would not add value and that the risk overview function is adequately addressed 
by having expanded the terms of reference of the audit committee to encompass matters of risk. The audit and risk committee 
operates in accordance with formal terms of reference that have been reviewed for King III compliance and that are annually reviewed 
and approved by the board. The terms of reference are posted on the Company’s website.
The audit and risk committee assists the board in fulfilling its corporate governance and oversight responsibilities by reviewing and 
making recommendations on the following:
•  The financial, business risk and information technology reporting processes and governance
•  The risk management systems, both financial and non-financial
•  The systems and adequacy of internal controls and safeguarding of the Company assets
•  Monitoring the integrity of the financial statements, integrated annual report and sustainability report
83
Corporate Governance Report (continued)
•  The internal and external audit process
•
The appointment of both the external and internal auditors and approving their remuneration and terms of engagement, monitoring 
their independence, objectivity and effectiveness
•  Regulating the use of external auditors for non-audit duties
•  The Company’s process for monitoring compliance with relevant laws and regulations.
The committee is satisfied that it has adequately discharged its responsibilities in the past financial period.
The combined assurance model is now well embedded throughout the business. The model assists in facilitating, integrating and 
aligning the various assurance processes in the Company to maximise risk and governance oversight and control efficiencies which, 
in turn, increases the overall level of assurance to the audit and risk committee.
The committee has the authority to conduct or authorise investigations into any matters within its scope of responsibilities.
During the period under review, the audit and risk committee was composed of three members, two of whom are independent 
non-executive directors and one of whom is the Implats chief finance officer. This is contrary to the King III recommendation that all 
members are independent and arises from the controlling interest of the majority shareholder.
The board appoints committee members and the chairman of the audit and risk committee from amongst the directors. The board 
considers that members are suitably qualified to perform their roles and that members bring a sufficient mix of appropriate experience 
and skills to the committee to enable it to satisfactorily carry out its function.
Details of members and their qualifications are reported on pages 28 to 31.
The chairman of this committee is an independent non-executive director who is considered to have the appropriate qualifications and 
expertise to effectively carry out this role. The audit and risk committee meets four times a year. Attendance during the period under 
review was as follows:

accordance with formal terms of reference that have been reviewed for King III compliance and that are annually reviewed and 
approved by the board.
84

KEY MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE (EXCO)
Responsibility for implementing board policy and for overseeing the day-to-day management of the operating subsidiary vests in Exco 
whose membership consists of:
•  Alexander Mhembere: Chairman
•  Stanley Segula: Managing Director
•  Stewart Mangoma: Chief Finance Officer
•  Takawira Maswiswi: General Manager – Human Resources
•  Amend Chiduma: General Manager – Engineering
•  Sibusisiwe Chindove: Head of Corporate Affairs
•  Lysias Chiwozva: Risk and Strategy Manager 
•  Garikai Bera: Legal Counsel and Company Secretary
Reporting into Exco are a number of other committees that are responsible for various aspects of the business, specifically, operations 
(the operations committee), finance (the finance committee), people (the people committee) and engineering and projects (the technical 
committee).
The responsible member of Exco chairs each of these committees, with membership drawn from appropriate executives and senior 
managers.
In  addition  to  these  functional  committees,  there  are  also  the  following  specialist 
management committees:
Project Steering Committee
This committee has been established in order to ensure that all 
technical and commercial aspects of the planned expansions 
are  subject  to  a  high  degree  of  scrutiny  and  review,  so 
as  to  ensure  the  feasibility  of  proposed  expansions. 
This  includes  ensuring  that  all  aspects  of  proposed
86
Corporate Governance Report (continued)
expansions are subject to a full independent third party review. The committee is chaired by the General Manager – Engineering. A 
senior executive of Implats responsible for project planning and implementation is a member of this committee. Representatives from 
the operating subsidiary, and also from Implats as required, sit on this committee and review ongoing progress in respect of all matters 
relating to expansion projects. The committee meets regularly as required by the progress of the various aspects.
Capital Steering Committee
The principal role of this committee is to consider and assess, for approval or recommendation to the board, all applications for 
both growth and stay-in-business capital expenditure. The committee operates within an approval framework and is mandated to 
approve expenditure to certain limits beyond which board approval is required. The General Manager – Engineering is chairman of 
the committee. Membership comprises representatives from a variety of disciplines within the operating subsidiary’s operations and 
an Implats representative is also a member.
Procurement Committee 
The procurement committee operates to terms of reference and is tasked with implementing procurement best practice and company 
policy on identified and approved procurement objectives. The committee is responsible for adjudicating and awarding procurement 
contracts and tenders, with all contracts awarded in excess of US$1 million being reported at board level. The committee is chaired 
by the chief finance officer with senior executives of the operating subsidiary and one Implats executive as members.
REMUNERATION REPORT
The philosophy of Zimplats is that it does not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, sex or disability and is committed to providing 
equal opportunities, safe working conditions and attractive remuneration to staff. Policies on employment have been developed to 
suit prevailing conditions.
The operating subsidiary endeavours to attract and retain talented and suitably qualified and experienced staff through performance-
based  reward  systems  that  operate  throughout  the  organisation,  including  an  incentive  scheme  that  is  directly  linked  to  key 
performance fundamentals for the Company.
Zimplats is an equal opportunity employer but does have a target of achieving a workforce 
complement of 10% women with representation across all levels, including the board, 
where currently one member (10%) is a woman. There is currently one woman 
at senior executive level (E band on the Paterson job grading system) out 
of 21. Currently the operating subsidiary employs 210 women (2015: 
207) and continues to work towards achieving the stated target.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
Non-executive directors are paid a cash fee only and they 
do not receive any equity based remuneration, bonus 
payments or retirement benefits.
87
Corporate Governance Report (continued)
The current approved annual aggregate limit of fees that can be paid to non-executive directors is US$600 000 which was approved 
by shareholders in 2012.
A 5% reduction in directors’ fees and committee fees was effected in the third quarter of FY2016 as part of cost rationalisation 
measures.
The non-executive directors’ annual board fees for the Group were as follows: 
Board fees
Chairman
Deputy Chairman

Committee fees are payable based on attendance and the annual fees were as follows:

continuous basis is such that regular and frequent application of thought to Company matters is required. Total fees paid during the 
period of US$451 022 (2015: US$446 249) are within the limit approved by shareholders in 2012.

EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT REMUNERATION
It  is  the  remuneration  policy  of  the  Group  that  executive  directors  and  senior  managers  receive  an  annual  base  salary  with 
superannuation equal to 10% of that base. In addition, a housing loan scheme and a vehicle purchase scheme are in place, both of 
which are governed by carefully managed rules. Educational allowances are paid up to predetermined levels and full use of a company 
vehicle is provided to executives and senior management. There is also provision of medical aid cover for the executives and senior 
management and their immediate families.
In addition and subject to the attainment of specific ‘on target’ performance goals, a performance incentive bonus is provided for 
each manager amounting to a maximum of 56% of basic annual salary in the case of the executive directors and E band managers 
and 43% in the case of D band managers.
88
Corporate Governance Report (continued)
Depending on the level of seniority, the constituent parts of the bonus incorporate a relative weighting for corporate targets, production 
and cost targets, safety performance and individual key performance measures. The performance of senior executives and managers 
was evaluated in accordance with the rules of the scheme during the course of the period.
The board has considered carefully the requirements of King III and Recommendation 8.2 of the ASX Corporate Governance Principles 
and Recommendations, Third Edition in relation to the disclosure of remuneration for specific persons, and believes that it is neither 
appropriate nor in the best interests of Zimplats and its shareholders to fully adopt this recommendation.
The retention of skills and the risk of a loss thereof remains a real threat for Zimplats. Accordingly the board is not willing to disclose 
details of remuneration and associated benefits paid to individuals on the executive team. The board believes that the remuneration paid 
to board members and executives is fair and reasonable, given Zimplats’ market capitalisation and the remuneration required to be paid 
to attract and retain key personnel in Zimbabwe. The Company does, however, make the following aggregate disclosure with respect 
to the remuneration of executive directors and key management personnel of the operating subsidiary, a total of 21 people (2015: 26):
Executive directors and senior executives
2016
 US$ 000
8 091
2015
 US$ 000
8 964
LONG-TERM INCENTIVES
It is essential to retain critical skills over the longer term and to motivate and incentivise employees in a way that also aligns the interest 
of senior managers with those of shareholders, which is principally done through long-term incentive plans.
In view of the limited free-float availability of Zimplats’ shares on the ASX, the board considers it inappropriate that executive directors 
and senior managers should be incentivised with such shares, and has instead introduced a scheme whereby they are incentivised 
on the basis of the allocation of shares and notional shares in the ultimate majority shareholder.
It was reported in 2012 that the long term incentive share appreciation reward scheme (SARS) was under review as it is not related to 
specific performance conditions. To comply with King III corporate governance principles and remuneration best practice, the current 
SARS is now being phased out in favour of a new long-term incentive plan (LTIP).
Share Appreciation Reward Scheme (SARS)
The SARS is a cash-settled share appreciation rights plan that confers the conditional right on a participant to be paid a cash bonus 
equal to the appreciation in the share price from the date of allocation to the date of surrender of the notional share. Participants 
receive once-off allocations under the scheme, expressed as a multiple of their salary which is topped-up as awards vest. The rights 
vest in equal tranches from year two through to year five and lapse ten years after the grant date.
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The LTIP was introduced in FY2013, and comprises both a conditional share plan (CSP) and a share appreciation rights plan (SAR). 
In terms of the SAR, conditional rights will be awarded to participants to receive shares in Implats calculated with reference to the 
increase in the share price from the award date until the date on which the SAR is exercised by the participants. A three-year vesting
89
Corporate Governance Report (continued)
period will apply, during which time the participants will have no rights in respect of the underlying shares. Vesting will be conditional 
on continued employment and a prescribed level of corporate performance. The participants will only be entitled to exercise the SARs 
subsequent to and to the extent that vesting has taken place. Participants will only become shareholders following the exercise of 
the SARs.
In terms of the CSP, fully paid shares are awarded free of charge to the participants at the end of a three-year vesting period. On 
the date of award, participants are only granted conditional rights to acquire these shares at a future date, and will only become 
shareholders with dividend and voting rights from vesting onwards. For the shares to vest participants must remain employed by the 
Company and for certain participants vesting of the shares will be subject to the achievement of defined Implats performance vesting 
conditions over the performance period.
The LTIP complies with the requirements of King III and emerging remuneration best practice in relation to share – based incentives.
RISK MANAGEMENT
The Company has adopted a policy on risk management which ensures an integrated approach to the management of risk in order 
that it becomes embedded in all business activities, and is more fully explained on page 56 of the report.
A risk-based approach is applied as an integral part of strategic and operational planning, including that of projects. Operationally, line 
managers take full responsibility for the processes and all risks under their control. The risk management processes and systems are 
in line with internationally recognised best practice, and are able to assess all internal and external forms of business risk. During the 
period the board reviewed and approved the risk tolerance and appetite levels related to strategic issues.
The board is ultimately responsible for risk management and regularly reviews the strategic risks and assesses the effectiveness of the 
executive team’s application of risk management. Risk is a standard agenda item on board and management meetings, with the board 
and audit and risk committee being routinely apprised of the inherent risks and state of risk-management controls.
90
Corporate Governance Report (continued)
The board committees, external specialists and the internal and external audit functions assist the board in providing independent 
assurance on the effectiveness of the management controls that are in place. To this end, the audit and risk committee receives 
reports on the combined assurance model. This model seeks to integrate and co-ordinate the various assurance processes that exist 
within the Group and provides a higher level of independent assurance to the board on matters of compliance and risk management.
From an internal control perspective, all accounting and administrative control systems are designed to provide reasonable assurance 
that the Group’s accounting records accurately reflect that all transactions are executed and recorded in accordance with sound business 
practices, that assets are safeguarded and that protection is provided against serious risk of error or loss in a cost-effective manner.
A  delegated  authority  approval  framework  is  in  place,  which  enables  employees  to  operate  and  act  within  clearly  defined  and 
communicated parameters.
Conventional insurance policies sufficient for the size and nature of the Company’s business provide additional cover and protection.
While under continuous review and improvement, the board is satisfied that the risk management and compliance processes that are 
in place are adequate to address the known risks and issues faced by the Company.
The risk management policy is available on the Company’s website.
SUSTAINABLE REPORTING
A detailed report on stakeholder engagement and non-financial performance indicators has been included in this report on pages 55 
to 79.
CODE OF ETHICS
Zimplats is committed to the highest ethical standards in all its dealings with all stakeholders and to this end has adopted a code of 
ethics with a zero tolerance stance on corruption, to which all directors, employees and suppliers are expected to adhere.
On joining the Group, all managers are required to sign a copy of the code of ethics and fraud policy. The policies provide clear 
guidance on business and personal conduct, conflicts of interest, the prevention of the dissemination of Company information, the 
acceptance of donations and gifts and the protection of the intellectual property and patents of the Company. Group policy prohibits 
political donations, either directly or indirectly. The policy provides a channel through which breaches of the code can be dealt with 
without fear of victimization, and outlines the disciplinary action (including dismissal or prosecution) that will be taken in the event of 
any contravention. Executive and line management are responsible and accountable for the implementation of the code of ethics, 
fraud policy and resultant procedures.
In order to further promote ethical behaviour and assure confidentiality, the Company subscribes to an independent and anonymous 
“whistle-blower” programme administered by Deloitte and monitored by internal audit. Internal security systems provide a further 
avenue of information relating to ethical behaviour.
91
Corporate Governance Report (continued)
A number of allegations were reported during the period. In line with the fraud policy all reported allegations are fully investigated and, 
for tracking purposes, a register is maintained. A total of 29 allegations were reported and 14 were confirmed as relating to unethical 
practices. Two cases are still under investigation and three awards are pending payment.
An analysis of reports follows:
Number of reports received
Number of employee dismissals
Number of rewards paid out
Total value of rewards paid out

DEALINGS IN SECURITIES
The Company observes a closed period, from the end of the relevant accounting period to the announcement of the interim or year-
end results, as the case may be, during which neither directors nor officers may deal, either directly or indirectly, in the shares of the 
Company or its listed majority shareholder. Outside of any closed periods, the prior written approval of the chief executive officer is 
required in order to deal in the said shares.
The securities trading policy is available on the Company’s website.
CONTINUOUS DISCLOSURE AND COMMUNICATIONS
As guided by the Company’s communication policy, shareholders, investors, analysts, the media, the market and employees are kept 
fully and timeously informed of all developments in the Group through a variety of means, including:
•
Engaging  pro-actively  and  constructively  with  various  stakeholders  including  shareholders,  government  bodies,  labour 
organisations and non-governmental organisations, including briefings and the hosting of visits to the Group’s operations.
 The timely and balanced continuous disclosure to the Australian Stock Exchange, with subsequent posting on the Company’s 
website, of all material matters concerning the Group. The chief finance officer has primary responsibility for ensuring that the 
Company complies with its disclosure obligations in terms of the Listing Rules. 
 Designating authorised spokespersons within the Group as the only employees who may communicate with the media or other 
external parties, in relation to matters subject to the continuous disclosure policy.

Based on the results of the formal documented review of the 
Company’s  system  of  internal  financial  controls  which  was 
performed by the internal audit function, nothing had come to

relation
in
The Company has now embedded enterprise risk management 
into day-to-day activities and risks are now considered during 
strategy formulation and key decision making processes.
In  respect  of  the  internal  audit  function,  the  committee  has 
received written confirmation from the service provider of their 
fulfillment of the internal audit mandate during the period.
Integrated annual report
The  audit  and  risk  committee  has  evaluated  the  integrated 
annual report incorporating the annual financial statements for 
the period ended 30 June 2016 and considers that it complies, 
in  all  material  aspects,  with  the  requirements  of  international 
financial reporting standards.
The committee has considered the sustainability information as 
disclosed in the integrated annual report and has assessed its 
consistency with the operational and other information known 
to committee members and is satisfied that the information is 
reliable and consistent with the financial results. The committee 
has also considered the external assurance providers’ report on 
sustainability and is satisfied that the information is reliable and 
consistent with the financial results.
The  committee  has  therefore  recommended  the  annual 
financial statements, as set out in the integrated annual report, 
for approval by the board which has subsequently approved the 
financial statements.

Directors’ Report
The directors have pleasure  in presenting their annual report, 
together  with  the  financial  statements  for  Zimplats  Holdings 
Limited (Zimplats or the Company) and the consolidated financial 
statements  of  Zimplats  Holdings  Limited  and  its  subsidiaries 
(together the ‘Group’), for the period ended 30 June 2016.
EMPOWERMENT
Zimplats continues to support the Government of Zimbabwe 
in  its  endeavours  to  encourage  indigenous  Zimbabweans  to 
acquire meaningful investments in major companies operating 
in key sectors of the economy.
PURPOSE OF THE COMPANY
Zimplats’  main  purpose  is  the  production  of  platinum  group 
metals and associated metals from its reserves and resources

CAPITAL

unchanged since last period at 500 million ordinary shares of 
10 cents each.
ISSUED SHARE CAPITAL
The issued share capital of the Company remains unchanged

UNISSUED SHARE CAPITAL
In terms of the articles of association of the Company, unissued

SHAREHOLDING IN THE COMPANY
The  number  of  shares  held  by  the  majority  shareholder  was 
unchanged  at  93  644  430  shares.  Shareholder  details  are 
reported on at page 150.
Shareholders have been kept informed of ongoing discussions 
with the Government of Zimbabwe with regards to the operating 
subsidiary’s compliance with the Indigenisation and Economic 
Empowerment Act (Chapter 14:33) in Zimbabwe.
In  March  2012,  the  Government  of  Zimbabwe  accepted  in 
principle  the  Company’s  indigenisation  proposals  towards 
achieving a 51% indigenous shareholding for transfer at fair value 
in the operating subsidiary, Zimbabwe Platinum Mines (Private) 
Limited.  Zimplats  has  continued  to  pursue  engagements 
with the government on a mutually acceptable indigenisation 
implementation  plan  (IIP)  for  the  operating  subsidiary.  In  this 
regard, the operating subsidiary submitted a new proposed IIP 
to the government in March 2016. The Group is engaging the 
government on the IIP.
LOSS OF GROUND
The  Government  of  Zimbabwe  published  a  preliminary 
notice  (under General Notice 123 of 2013 in the Zimbabwe 
Government Gazette Extraordinary of 1 March 2013) advising 
of  its  intention  to  acquire  compulsorily  27  948  hectares,  or 
approximately half of the land held by the operating subsidiary. 
The operating subsidiary lodged an objection to the notice on 
27 March 2013.
From  June  2015,  the  operating  subsidiary  was  actively 
engaged in discussions with the government in an endeavour 
to resolve the matter amicably. However, on 29 June 2016, the 
operating subsidiary was served with an application filed in the 
Administrative Court of Zimbabwe in which the government is 
seeking an order authorising the acquisition by the government 
of the land described in the preliminary notice. The Company 
was cited as the respondent in the application. Papers opposing 
the application were filed on behalf of the Company and the
Directors’ Report (continued)
operating  subsidiary.  The  matter  is  therefore  pending  in  the 
Administrative Court of Zimbabwe. The operating subsidiary will 
however still seek to have the matter resolved amicably.
•
That the Group’s risk management and internal compliance 
and control system is operating efficiently and effectively in 
all material respects.

FINANCIAL AFFAIRS
The financial results for the period are set out on pages 102 to 
147. The Company performed well under the backdrop of a 
challenging period mainly due to low metal prices.
No dividend has been declared for the period in view of the 
pressure on cash and the need to conserve funds with metal 
prices forecast to remain at low levels.
No significant events have occurred, since the date of these 
financial  statements  and  the  date  of  approval  thereof,  the 
knowledge of which would affect the ability of the user of these 
statements to make proper evaluations and decisions.
The  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  using  the 
appropriate  accounting  policies,  supported  by  reasonable 
and  prudent  judgements  and  estimates.  The  directors  have 
a  reasonable  expectation  that  the  Company  has  adequate 
resources to continue as a going concern in the foreseeable 
future.  However,  in  the  current  economic  environment  this 
expectation  will  need  to  be  continuously  reassessed  to 
determine its reasonableness.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCE 
OFFICER CERTIFICATION
The  chief  executive  officer  and  the  chief  finance  officer  have 
made the following certification to the board on the basis that 
there  is  nothing  that  has  come  to  their  attention  that  would 
cause them to report otherwise:
•
That  the  Group  financial  reports  present  a  true  and  fair 
view, in all material respects, of the financial condition and 
operational results of the Group and are in accordance with 
relevant accounting standards
 That the Group has adopted an appropriate system of risk 
management  and  internal  compliance  and  control  which 
implements the policies adopted by the board and forms 
the basis of the statement given above
•

The Directors’ Statement of Responsibility
For the Period Ended 30 June 2016
99
The  Company’s  directors  are  responsible  for  the  preparation, 
integrity and objectivity of the financial statements, comprising 
the statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, statement 
of comprehensive income, the statement of changes in equity 
and the statement of cash flows for the period then ended and 
the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary 
of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes, 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS).
To enable the directors to meet those responsibilities:
•
The board and management set standards and management 
implements  systems  of 
internal  control,  accounting 
and  information  systems  aimed  at  providing  reasonable 
assurance that assets are safeguarded and the risk of error, 
fraud  or  loss  is  reduced  in  a  cost  effective  manner,  and 
make  appropriate  accounting  estimates.  These  controls, 
contained in established policies and procedures, include 
the  proper  delegation  of  responsibilities  and  authorities 
within  a  clearly  defined  framework,  effective  accounting 
procedures and adequate segregation of duties.
•
The Group’s internal audit function, which is outsourced and 
operates  independently,  appraises,  evaluates  and,  when 
necessary, recommends improvements in the systems of 
internal control and accounting practices, based on audits 
carried out on various functions or aspects of the business.
•
The  audit  and  risk  committee,  together  with  the  internal 
auditors, play an integral role in matters relating to financial 
and  internal  control,  accounting  policies,  reporting  and 
disclosure.
Based  on  the  results  of  a  formal  documented  review  of  the 
systems  of  internal  controls  and  risk  management,  covering 
both the adequacy in design and effectiveness in implementation 
performed by the internal audit function during the period, the 
board of directors has considered:
•
information  and  explanations  provided  by
the 
management
 discussions  held  with  the  independent  auditors  on  the 
results of the audit
line
•
•   the assessment by the audit and risk committee.
Nothing has come to the attention of the board that caused 
it to believe that the Group’s systems of internal controls and 
risk management are not effective and that the internal financial 
controls do not form a sound basis for the preparation of reliable 
financial statements. The board’s opinion is underpinned by the 
audit and risk committee’s statement.
To  their  best  knowledge  and  belief,  based  on  the  above, 
the  directors  are  satisfied  that  no  material  breakdown  in  the 
operation of the systems of internal control and procedures has 
occurred during the period under review.
100
The Directors’ Statement of Responsibility
For the Period Ended 30 June 2016 (continued)
The  directors  have  reviewed  the  performance  and  financial 
position of the Group to the date of signing of these financial 
statements  and  the  prospects,  based  on  the  budgets,  and 
are satisfied that the Group is a going concern and therefore 
continue  to  adopt  the  going  concern  assumption  in  the 
preparation  of  these  financial  statements.  However,  the 
directors believe that under the current economic environment 
a continuous assessment of the ability of the Group to continue 
to operate as a going concern will need to be performed to 
determine the continued appropriateness of the going concern 
assumption that has been applied in the preparation of these 
financial statements.
It is the responsibility of the independent auditors to report on 
the financial statements. Their report to the shareholders of the 
Company is set out on page 101.
APPROVAL OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The  directors’  report  and  the  financial  statements  were 
approved  by  the  board  of  directors  on  12  August  2016  and 
were signed on its behalf by:

Independent Auditors’ Report
to the shareholders of
ZIMPLATS HOLDINGS LIMITED
Report on the financial statements
We have audited the consolidated and separate financial statements of Zimplats Holdings Limited, which comprise the statements of 
financial position as at 30 June 2016, and the statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the period 
then ended, and notes, comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information, set out on pages  
102 to 147.
Directors’ responsibility for the financial statements
The directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated and separate financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of consolidated and separate financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.
Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated and separate financial statements based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements 
and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated and separate financial statements are 
free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the 
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant 
to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit 
also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by 
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the consolidated and separate financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated and separate 
financial position of Zimplats Holdings Limited as at 30 June 2016, and its consolidated and separate financial performance and its 
consolidated and separate cash flows for the period then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.

2.1
GENERAL INFORMATION
Zimplats Holdings Limited (the ‘Company’) is a limited liability company domiciled in Guernsey, Channel Islands and listed 
on the Australian Stock Exchange. The consolidated financial statements for the period ended 30 June 2016 comprise the 
Company and its subsidiaries (together the ‘Group’).
The Group’s principal business is producing platinum group metals (which primarily include platinum, palladium, rhodium, 
iridium and ruthenium) and associated metals (nickel, gold, copper, cobalt and silver) mined from the Great Dyke in Zimbabwe.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated. Accounting policies that refer to the 
Group, apply equally to the Company financial statements where relevant.
BASIS OF PREPARATION
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) and the 
International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee (‘IFRS IC’) interpretations, applicable to companies 
reporting  under  IFRS.  The  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  under  the  historical  cost  convention  except  for  the 
liabilities for cash-settled share-based payment arrangements which are measured using a binomial option model.
The financial statements have historically been prepared based on an internal cut-off date for financial information ending 
on 21 June in line with the metallurgical cut-off date each year. The Group has decided to align the internal cut-off date and 
the date of the financial statements by moving the internal month end date of 21 June to 30 June. The current consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income resultantly includes a period of one year and nine days with no significant impact. Refer 
to revenue recognition under note 4(f).
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company and the Group will 
continue in existence for the foreseeable future. The directors have assessed the ability of the Group to continue as a going 
concern and believe that the preparation of these financial statements on a going concern basis is still appropriate.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also 
requires management and the board to exercise their judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. 
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to 
the financial statements are disclosed in note 4.
2.1.1  Changes in accounting policy and disclosures
a)  New standards, amendments and interpretations effective for the first time for 30 June 2016 year ends
There are no new standards, amendments and interpretations effective for the first time for 30 June 2016 year ends that 
are relevant to the Group.
b)   New Standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for 30 June 2016 year ends that
are relevant to the Group but have not been early adopted
Standard / Interpretation
Amendments to IAS 7, 
‘Cash flow statements’
Effective date
1 January 2017
Executive summary
In  January  2016,  the  International  Accounting  Standards  Board 
(IASB)  issued  an  amendment  to  IAS  7  introducing  an  additional 
disclosure that will enable users of financial statements to evaluate 
changes in liabilities arising from financing activities. The amendment 
responds to requests from investors for information that helps them 
better understand changes in an entity’s debt. The amendment will 
affect every entity preparing IFRS financial statements. However, the 
information  required  should  be  readily  available.  Preparers  should 
consider how best to present the additional information to explain the 
changes in liabilities arising from financing activities.

Standard / Interpretation
Amendments to IAS 1, 
‘Presentation of financial 
statements’ disclosure initiative
Effective date
1 January 2016
Executive summary
In December 2014 the IASB issued amendments to clarify guidance 
in IAS 1 on materiality and aggregation, the presentation of subtotals, 
the structure of financial statements and the disclosure of accounting 
policies.
IFRS 15 – ‘Revenue from 
contracts with customers’
1 January 2018
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and IASB issued 
their long awaited converged standard on revenue recognition on 29 
May 2014. It is a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model 
for  all  contracts  with  customers  to  achieve  greater  consistency  in 
the recognition and presentation of revenue. Revenue is recognised 
based on the satisfaction of performance obligations, which occurs 
when control of a good or service transfers to a customer.
IFRS 16, ‘Leases’
1 January 2019  After ten years of joint drafting by the IASB and FASB, they decided 
that  lessees  should  be  required  to  recognise  assets  and  liabilities 
arising from all leases (with limited exceptions) on the statement of 
financial position. Lessor accounting has not substantially changed in 
the new standard.
The model reflects that, at the start of a lease, the lessee obtains the 
right to use an asset for a period of time and has an obligation to 
pay for that right. In response to concerns expressed about the cost 
and complexity to apply the requirements to large volumes of small 
assets, the IASB decided not to require a lessee to recognise assets 
and liabilities for short-term leases (less than 12 months), and leases 
for which the underlying asset is of low value (such as laptops and 
office furniture).
A lessee measures lease liabilities at the present value of future lease 
payments.  A  lessee  measures  lease  assets,  initially  at  the  same 
amount as lease liabilities, and also includes costs directly related to 
entering into the lease. Lease assets are amortised in a similar way to 
other assets such as property, plant and equipment. This approach 
will result in a more faithful representation of a lessee’s assets and 
liabilities and, together with enhanced disclosures, will provide greater 
transparency of a lessee’s financial leverage and capital employed.
One of the implications of the new standard is that there will be a 
change  to  key  financial  ratios  derived  from  a  lessee’s  assets  and 
liabilities (for example, leverage and performance ratios).
IFRS 16 supersedes IAS 17, ‘Leases’, IFRIC 4, ‘Determining whether 
an  arrangement  contains  a  lease’,  SIC  15,  ‘Operating  leases  – 
Incentives’  and  SIC  27,  ‘Evaluating  the  substance  of  transactions 
Involving the legal form of a lease’.
Amendments to IAS 27, 
'Separate financial statements' 
on equity accounting
1 January 2016
In this amendment the IASB has restored the option to use the equity 
method to account for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and 
associates in an entity’s separate financial statements.
The Group is still assessing the impact of these new standards, amendments and interpretations and the timing of their adoption.

Executive summary
The  postponement  applies  to  changes  introduced  by  the 
International  Accounting  Standards  Board  (IASB)  in  2014 
through narrow-scope amendments to IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated 
Financial Statements’ and IAS 28 ‘Investments in Associates 
and Joint Ventures’. Those changes affect how an entity should 
determine any gain or loss it recognises when assets are sold or 
contributed between the entity and an associate or joint venture 
in which it invests. The changes do not affect other aspects 
of how entities account for their investments in associates and 
joint ventures.
The reason for making the decision to postpone the effective 
date is that the IASB is planning a broader review that may result 
in the simplification of accounting for such transactions and of 
other aspects of accounting for associates and joint ventures.
The  amendments  clarify  the  application  of  the  consolidation 
exception for investment entities and their subsidiaries.
The  amendments  were  issued  to  clarify  the  requirements  for 
recognising  deferred  tax  assets  on  unrealised  losses.  The 
amendments clarify the accounting for deferred tax where an 
asset is measured at fair value and that fair value is below the 
asset’s tax base. They also clarify other aspects of accounting 
for deferred tax assets.
The amendments clarify the existing guidance under IAS 12. 
They do not change the underlying principles for the recognition 
of deferred tax assets.
In this amendment the IASB has clarified that the use of revenue 
based methods to calculate the depreciation of an asset is not 
appropriate  because  revenue  generated  by  an  activity  that 
includes  the  use  of  an  asset  generally  reflects  factors  other 
than the consumption of the economic benefits embodied in 
the asset. The IASB has also clarified that revenue is generally 
presumed  to  be  an  inappropriate  basis  for  measuring  the 
consumption  of  the  economic  benefits  embodied  in  an 
intangible asset.

Amendments to IAS 16,

and IAS 41, 'Agriculture' on

1 January 2016
Executive summary
This IFRS is part of the IASB’s project to replace IAS 39. IFRS 
9 addresses classification and measurement of financial assets 
and  replaces  the  multiple  classification  and  measurement 
models  in  IAS  39  with  a  single  model  that  has  only  two 
classification categories: amortised cost and fair value.
The IASB has updated IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’ to include 
guidance  on  financial  liabilities  and  derecognition  of  financial 
instruments.  The  accounting  and  presentation  for  financial 
liabilities and for derecognising financial instruments has been 
relocated from IAS 39, ‘Financial instruments: Recognition and 
measurement’,  without  change,  except  for  financial  liabilities 
that are designated at fair value through profit or loss.
This amendment adds new guidance on how to account for the 
acquisition of an interest in a joint operation that constitutes a 
business. The amendments specify the appropriate accounting 
treatment for such acquisitions.
The IASB has issued IFRS 14, ‘Regulatory deferral accounts’ 
specific to first time adopters (‘IFRS 14’), an interim standard 
on  the  accounting  for  certain  balances  that  arise  from  rate-
regulated activities (‘regulatory deferral accounts’). 
Rate regulation is a framework where the price that an entity 
charges to its customers for goods and services is subject to 
oversight and/or approval by an authorised body.
In this amendment to IAS 16 the IASB has scoped in bearer 
plants, but not the produce on bearer plants and explained that 
a bearer plant not yet in the location and condition necessary 
to bear produce is treated as a self-constructed asset. In this 
amendment to IAS 41, the IASB has adjusted the definition of 
a bearer plant to include examples of non-bearer plants and 
remove current examples of bearer plants from IAS 41.

2.2
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when 
the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control 
is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations.
Inter-company  transactions,  balances  and  unrealised  gains  on  transactions  between  group  companies  are  eliminated. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. 
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by 
the Group.
Changes in ownership interests 
The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control as transactions with equity 
owners of the Group. A change in ownership interest results in an adjustment between the carrying amounts of the controlling 
and  non-controlling  interest  to  reflect  their  relative  interests  in  the  subsidiary.    A  difference  between  the  amount  of  the 
adjustment to non-controlling interest in any consideration paid or received is recognised in a separate reserve within equity 
attributable to the owners of the Group.
When the Group ceases to consolidate or equity account for an investment because of a loss of control, joint control or 
significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value at the date when control is lost with the 
change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of 
subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts 
previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly 
disposed  of  the  related  assets  or  liabilities.  This  may  mean  that  amounts  previously  recognised  in  other  comprehensive 
income are reclassified to profit or loss.
Accounting policy for investment in subsidiaries in separate financial statements of the Company 
All investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less accumulated allowance for impairment.
2.3
SEGMENT INFORMATION
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision 
maker. The executive committee has been identified as the chief operating decision maker and is responsible for making 
strategic decisions, allocating resources and assessing the performance of the operating segments.
An operating segment is a component of an entity:
•   That engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses (including revenues and expenses
relating to transactions with other components of the same entity);
•   Whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s chief operating decision maker to make decisions about
resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance; and
•  For which discrete financial information is available.
The Group operates within the mining industry. The activities of the Group are entirely related to the mining and processing of 
platinum and associated metals from the Great Dyke in Zimbabwe.

Notes to the Financial Statements
For the Period Ended 30 June 2016 (continued)
2.4
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates (the ‘functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are 
presented in United States Dollars (US$), which is the Group’s functional and presentation currency.
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of 
the transactions or valuation where items are remeasured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement 
of such transactions and from the translation at period end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies at period end exchange rates are generally recognised in the income statement.
Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings are presented in the income statement within finance costs. 
All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the income statement on a net basis within income or other 
expenses.
Foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the income statement within other “expenses or income”.
2.5
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and less accumulated impairment 
losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
The present value of decommissioning costs, which is the cost of dismantling and removal of the asset included in the 
environmental rehabilitation provision, is included in the cost of the related assets and changes in the liability resulting from 
changes in the estimates are accounted for as follows:
•   Any decrease in the liability reduces the cost of the asset. The decrease in the asset is limited to its carrying amount and
any excess is accounted for in the income statement
•   Any increase in the liability increases the carrying amount of the asset. An increase to the cost of an asset is tested for
impairment when there is an indication of impairment
•   These assets are depreciated over their useful lives and are expensed in the income statement as a cost of production.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when 
it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be 
measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognised when replaced.  
All other repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the reporting period in which they are 
incurred.
Assets  are  not  depreciated  when  the  residual  value  equals  or  exceeds  the  carrying  value  of  the  asset.  Depreciation  is 
calculated on the carrying amount less residual value of the assets. Depreciation methods and depreciation rates are applied 
consistently within each asset class. The depreciation calculation is adjusted prospectively for changes in the residual value 
and useful lives.
112
Notes to the Financial Statements
For the Period Ended 30 June 2016 (continued)
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than 
its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within 
other operating income or expense in the income statement.
Mining claims
Mining claims not expensed, are not depreciated until a claim is explored and a mine is operational. Depreciation is based on 
the units of production method. Mining claims are the right to extract minerals from a tract of public land.
Mining assets
Individual  mining  assets  are  depreciated  using  the  units-of-production  method  based  on  their  respective  estimated 
economically recoverable proved and probable mineral reserves, limited to the life of mine.
Metallurgical assets
Metallurgical assets are depreciated using the units-of-production method based on the expected estimated economically 
recoverable proved and probable mineral reserves to be concentrated or refined by that asset.
At 30 June 2016, the life of mine was estimated as follows:
Mine
Rukodzi Mine
Ngwarati Mine
Bimha Mine
Mupfuti Mine
South Pit Mine
Estimated useful life
6 years
9 years
31 years
13 years
3 years
Land and buildings
Land  is  not  depreciated.  Buildings  are  depreciated  over  the  life  of  mine  using  the  units-of-production  method  and  the 
economically recoverable proved and probable mineral reserves, limited to the life of mine.
Mobile equipment 
This category includes trackless mining machinery and motor vehicles. These assets are depreciated using the straight line 
method over the useful life of the asset as follows:
Asset type
Trackless mining machinery
Motor vehicles
Estimated useful life
5 years
4 to 5 years
Service and other assets
Service assets comprise mainly the Ngezi Road, internal access roads and reticulation to staff housing, a 330kV substation and 
sewage facilities. These assets are depreciated over the life of mine using the units-of-production method and the economically 
recoverable proved and probable mineral reserves, limited to the life of mine.

Other assets comprise the mine rehabilitation assets, information technology equipment and furniture and fittings. The mine 
rehabilitation  assets  are  depreciated  over  the  life  of  mine  using  the  units-of-production  method.  Information  technology 
equipment, furniture and fittings are depreciated using the straight line method over the useful life of the asset as follows:
Asset type
Information technology equipment
Furniture, fittings and office equipment
Estimated useful life
3 years
5 years
Mining exploration
Expenditure on mining exploration in new areas of interest is charged against income as incurred. Costs related to property 
acquisitions, surface and mineral rights are capitalised to mining assets and are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and impairment losses.
Assets under construction
Pre-production expenditure, including evaluation costs incurred to establish or expand productive capacity, to support and 
maintain that productive capacity incurred on mines is capitalised to property, plant and equipment. The recognition of costs 
in the carrying amount of an asset ceases when the item is in the location and condition necessary to operate as intended by 
management.
Any net income earned while the item is not yet capable of operating as intended reduces the capitalised amount. Interest on 
borrowings, specifically to finance the establishment of mining assets, is capitalised during the construction phase.
Stripping costs
Waste removal costs incurred during the production phase of an open-pit mine to provide improved access to future ore (to 
be mined over a period of more than 12 months) are recognised as stripping activity assets in property, plant and equipment. 
The stripping costs incurred in the ordinary course of operations in an open-pit mine are expensed as incurred. The stripping 
activity asset is depreciated over the expected useful life of the identified component of the ore body to which access has 
been improved as a result of the stripping activity using the units-of-production method.
There were no stripping costs meeting the capitalisation criteria as at 30 June 2016 (2015: US$nil).
Care and maintenance
Projects that are transferred to care and maintenance are carried forward to the extent to which recoupment out of revenue 
following the return to production or sale of the mine is reasonably assured. Depreciation is provided in respect of properties 
in accordance with the policy.
EXPLORATION FOR AND EVALUATION OF MINERAL RESOURCES
The Group expenses all exploration and evaluation expenditure until the directors conclude that a future economic benefit is 
more likely than not to be realised, i.e. probable, thereafter, exploration and evaluation expenses are capitalised. In evaluating 
if expenditures meet this criterion to be capitalised, the directors utilise several different sources of information depending on 
the level of exploration. While the criteria for concluding that expenditure should be capitalised are always the ‘probability’ of 
future benefits, the information that the directors use to make that determination depends on the level of exploration.
•   Exploration and evaluation expenditure on greenfield sites, being those where the Group does not have any mineral deposits 
which are already being mined or developed, is expensed as incurred until a final feasibility study has been completed, 
after which the expenditure is capitalised within development costs, if the final feasibility study demonstrates that future 
economic benefits are probable.
114
Notes to the Financial Statements
For the Period Ended 30 June 2016 (continued)
•   Exploration and evaluation expenditure on brownfield sites, being those adjacent to mineral deposits which are already being 
mined or developed, is expensed as incurred until the directors are able to demonstrate that future economic benefits are 
probable through the completion of a prefeasibility study, after which the expenditure is capitalised as a mine development 
cost. A ‘prefeasibility study’ consists of a comprehensive study of the viability of a mineral project that has advanced to 
a stage where the mining method, in the case of underground mining, or the pit configuration, in the case of an open pit, 
has been established, and which, if an effective method of mineral processing has been determined, includes a financial 
analysis based on reasonable assumptions of technical, engineering, operating economic factors and the evaluation of 
other relevant factors.
The pre-feasibility study, when combined with existing knowledge of the mineral property that is adjacent to mineral deposits 
that are already being mined or developed, allows the directors to conclude that it is more likely than not that the group will 
obtain future economic benefit from the expenditures.
•   Exploration  and  evaluation  expenditure  relating  to  extensions  of  mineral  deposits  which  are  already  being  mined  or 
developed,  including  expenditure  on  the  definition  of  mineralisation  of  such  mineral  deposits,  is  capitalised  as  a  mine 
development cost following the completion of an economic evaluation equivalent to a prefeasibility study. This economic 
evaluation is distinguished from a prefeasibility study in that some of the information that would normally be determined in a 
prefeasibility study is instead obtained from the existing mine or development. This information when combined with existing 
knowledge of the mineral property already being mined or developed allows the directors to conclude that more likely than 
not the Group will obtain future economic benefit from the expenditures.
•   Exploration and evaluation assets acquired in a business combination are initially recognised at fair value. Subsequently 
it is stated at cost less impairment provision. Once commercial reserves are found, exploration and evaluation assets are 
tested for impairment and transferred to assets under construction. No amortisation is charged during the exploration and 
evaluation phase.
For  the  purposes  of  assessing  impairment,  the  exploration  and  evaluation  assets  subject  to  testing  are  grouped  with 
existing cash-generating units of operating mines that are located in the same geographical region. Where the assets are 
not associated with a specific cash-generating unit, the recoverable amount is assessed using fair value less cost to sell for 
the specific exploration area.
2.7
IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment, or more 
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired.  Other assets are tested for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss 
is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount 
is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.
The recoverability of the long-term mining assets is based on estimates of future discounted cash flows. These estimates are 
subject to risks and uncertainties including future metal prices and exchange rates. It is therefore possible that changes can 
occur which may affect the recoverability of the mining assets. The recoverable amounts of non-mining assets are generally 
determined by reference to market values. Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, the impairment is 
charged against income to reduce the carrying amount to the recoverable amount of the asset. The revised carrying amounts 
are depreciated over the remaining lives of such affected assets.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable 
cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets (cash-generating units). 
Non-financial assets that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at the end of each 
reporting period.

2.8
LEASES
Leases  in  which  a  significant  portion  of  the  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  are  retained  by  the  lessor  are  classified  as 
operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
2.9
FINANCIAL ASSETS
Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets in the loans and receivables category. The classification depends on the purposes for 
which the financial assets were acquired.  Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than twelve months after the reporting 
date. These are classified as non-current assets. The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and 
cash and balances with banks in the statement of financial position.
Recognition and derecognition
Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date, the date on which the Group commits 
to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments 
have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Measurement
At initial recognition, the Group measures financial assets at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not carried at fair 
value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Loans and 
receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Interest on loans and receivables 
calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of 
financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only 
if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the 
asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or 
group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial 
difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other 
financial reorganisation, and where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash 
flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.
Assets carried at amortised cost
For loans and receivables, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and 
the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at 
the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The carrying value of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is 
recognised in the income statement. If a loan or held-to-maturity investment has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for 
measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. As a practical expedient, 
the Group may measure impairment on the basis of an instrument’s fair value using an observable market price.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an 
event occurring after the impairment was recognised (such as an improvement in the debtor’s credit rating), the reversal of the 
previously recognised impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
116
Notes to the Financial Statements
For the Period Ended 30 June 2016 (continued)
2.10  OFFSETTING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position when there is a 
legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the 
asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must 
be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the company or the 
counterparty.
2.11
INVENTORIES
Ore, concentrate and matte stocks
Ore, concentrate and matte stocks are valued at the lower of cost (average cost of production) and estimated net realisable 
value. Quantities of in-process metals are based on latest available assays allocated to main products on a units produced basis.
Consumable stocks
Stores and materials are stated at the lower of cost (on a weighted average basis) and net realisable value. The cost of stores 
and  materials  includes  expenditure  incurred  in  acquiring  the  inventories  and  bringing  them  to  their  existing  location  and 
condition. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of 
completion and selling expenses.
2.12
TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
Trade and other receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold in the ordinary course of business. If collection is 
expected to be settled within one year or less, they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current 
assets.
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less allowance for impairment.
Individual receivables which are known to be uncollectible are written off by reducing the carrying amount directly. The other 
receivables are assessed collectively to determine whether there is objective evidence that an impairment has been incurred 
but not yet identified. For these receivables the estimated impairment losses are recognised in a separate allowance for 
impairment account.
The Group considers that there is evidence of impairment if any of the following indicators are present:
- significant financial difficulties of the debtor
- probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and
- default or delinquency in payments (more than 30 days overdue).
Receivables  for  which  an  impairment  allowance  was  recognised  are  written  off  against  the  allowance  when  there  is  no 
expectation of recovering additional cash.
Impairment  losses  are  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  within  administrative  expenses.  Subsequent  recoveries  of  amounts 
previously written off are credited against administrative expenses.
2.13  CASH AND BALANCES WITH BANKS
Cash and balances with banks comprise cash held with banks and cash on hand. Balances with banks are short-term highly 
liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and 
which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in fair value.
117
Notes to the Financial Statements
For the Period Ended 30 June 2016 (continued)
2.14  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
In the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and balances with banks and the revolving facility 
which operates as a bank overdraft. The revolving facility is shown within borrowings in the statement of financial position.
2.15    SHARE CAPITAL
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown 
in equity as a deduction, net of tax from the proceeds. Where any group company purchases the Company’s equity share 
capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) is 
deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such 
shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable to incremental transaction costs 
and the related income tax effects is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders.
2.16      BORROWINGS
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in 
profit or loss over the period of borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable 
that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the drawdown occurs. To the extent 
there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment 
for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.
Borrowings are derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired. The difference 
between  the  carrying  amount  of  a  financial  liability  that  has  been  extinguished  or  transferred  to  another  party  and  the 
consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss as other 
income or finance costs.
Where the terms of a financial liability are renegotiated and the entity issues equity instruments to a creditor to extinguish all 
or part of the liability (debt for equity swap), a gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss, which is measured as the difference 
between the carrying amount of the financial liability and the fair value of the equity instruments issued.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for 
at least twelve months after the reporting period.
2.17  BORROWING COSTS
General and specific borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets.
(which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale) are capitalised 
during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use or sale.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets 
is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
Other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
118
Notes to the Financial Statements
For the Period Ended 30 June 2016 (continued)
2.18
TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES
Trade and other payables represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial 
period which are unpaid. The amounts are unsecured and usually paid within two months of recognition.  Trade and other 
payables are classified as current liabilities unless payment is not due within twelve months after the reporting date.
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method.
2.19   PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is 
probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount 
can be reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by 
considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to 
any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.
Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditures required to settle the present 
obligation at the end of the reporting period.  The discount rate used to determine the present value is a pre-tax rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision 
due to the passage of time is recognised as interest expense.
Environmental rehabilitation provision 
These  long  term  obligations  result  from  environmental  disturbances  associated  with  the  Group’s  mining  and  processing 
operations. Estimates are determined by independent environmental specialists in accordance with environmental regulations.
Decommissioning costs
These  costs  will  arise  from  rectifying  damage  caused  before  production  commences.  The  net  present  value  of  future 
decommissioning cost estimates as at period-end are recognised and provided for in full in the financial statements. The 
estimates are reviewed annually to take into account the effects of changes in the estimates. Estimated cash flows have been 
adjusted to reflect risks and timing specific to the rehabilitation liability. Discount rates that reflect the time value of money are 
utilised in calculating the present value.
Changes in the measurement of the liability, apart from unwinding the discount, which is recognised in the income statement 
as a finance cost, are capitalised to property, plant and equipment.
Restoration costs
Restoration costs represent the cost of restoring site damage caused after the start of production. The net present value of 
future rehabilitation costs estimated as at period end are recognised and provided for in full in the financial statements. The 
estimates are reviewed annually to take into account the effects of inflation and changes in estimates. Discount rates that 
reflect time value of money are utilised in calculating the present value. Changes in the measurement of the liability, apart from 
unwinding the discount which is recognised in the income statement as a finance cost, are capitalised to the environmental 
rehabilitation asset. Increases in this provision are charged to the income statement as a cost of production.
On-going rehabilitation costs
The cost of the on-going current programmes to prevent and control pollution is charged against income as incurred.

Notes to the Financial Statements
For the Period Ended 30 June 2016 (continued)
2.20  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Short-term employee benefits
Short-term benefits comprise wages and salaries, accumulated leave pay, bonuses and any non-monetary benefits that are 
expected to be settled wholly within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related 
service. Short term benefits are recognised in respect of employee’s services up to the end of the reporting period and are 
measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled.
The liabilities are presented as current employee benefit obligations in the statement of financial position. Short-term employee 
benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.
Pension obligations
The Group participates in defined contribution retirement plans for certain employees.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contribution into a separate entity. The 
Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all 
employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
Contributions paid to independently managed funds are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due.  Prepaid 
contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever 
an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits when it 
is demonstrably committed to a termination when the entity has a detailed formal plan to terminate the employment of current 
employees without possibility of withdrawal. In the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination 
benefits are measured based on the number of employees expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than 12 
months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to their present value.
Cash-settled share based payments
Long-term incentive plan – share appreciation rights (LTIP – SAR-new) 
Conditional rights are awarded to participants to receive shares in Impala Platinum Holdings Limited. The number of shares 
awarded is calculated with reference to the increase in the share price from the award date until the date on which the share 
appreciation right (SAR) is exercised by the participants. A three-year vesting period applies, during which time the participants 
have no rights in respect of the underlying shares. Vesting is conditional on continued employment and a prescribed level of 
corporate performance. The participants are only entitled to exercise the SARs subsequent to and to the extent that vesting 
has taken place. Participants become shareholders of Impala Platinum Holdings Limited following the exercise of the SARs. 
All unexercised SARs lapse after six years from date of allocation
The fair value, on grant date, of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the SAR is recognised as an 
expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in the share based compensation 
liability. The fair value is determined by using the binomial option valuation model and assumptions used to determine the fair 
value are detailed in note 4. At each reporting date, the total amount to be expensed is determined by the number of options 
that are expected to become exercisable, taking into account non-market vesting conditions.
120
Notes to the Financial Statements
For the Period Ended 30 June 2016 (continued)
Long-term incentive plan - share appreciation rights (LTIP – SAR- run-off)
The Group allocates to executives and senior managers notional shares in Impala Platinum Holdings Limited. These notional 
shares will confer the conditional right on a participant to be paid a cash bonus equal to the appreciation in the share price 
from the date of allocation to the date of vesting of the notional share. Notional shares vest after two years of allocation to a 
maximum of 25% of the allocation. In subsequent years, an additional 25% becomes exercisable per year. After 10 years from 
date of allocation, all unexercised shares lapse.
Long-term incentive plan - conditional share plan (LTIP - CSP)
Fully paid shares in Impala Platinum Holdings Limited are awarded free of charge to the participants at the end of a three-
year vesting period. On the date of award, participants are only granted conditional rights to acquire these shares at a future 
date, and only become shareholders with rights from vesting onwards. There are two conditional share plans in effect. For the 
shares to vest in both instances participants must remain employed by the Company but, for certain of these shares, vesting 
of the shares are subject to the achievement of defined performance vesting conditions over the performance period.
2.21  CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX
The income tax expense for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income based on the applicable 
income  tax  rate  for  each  jurisdiction  adjusted  by  changes  in  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  attributable  to  temporary 
differences and to unused tax losses.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the statement 
of financial position date in the countries where the Group’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management 
periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to 
interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is recognised in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of 
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised 
if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill.  Deferred income tax is also not accounted for if it arises from initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects 
neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been 
enacted or substantially enacted by the statement of financial position date and are expected to apply when the related 
deferred  income tax asset is realised or deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those 
temporary differences.
Deferred income tax liabilities are provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, 
except for deferred income tax liabilities where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group 
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised on deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, only 
to the extent that it is probable the temporary difference will reverse in the future and there is sufficient taxable profit against 
which the temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current income tax assets 
against current income tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by 
the same taxation authority.  Current income tax assets and liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right 
to offset and intends to settle the balance on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
121
Notes to the Financial Statements
For the Period Ended 30 June 2016 (continued)
Current and deferred income tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised 
in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or 
directly in equity, respectively.
2.22  REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable in 
respect of the sale of metals produced in the ordinary course of the Group’s activities.
Revenue is recognised when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will 
flow to the entity and specific criteria have been met for each of the Group’s activities as described below. The Group bases 
its estimates on historical results.
The Group sells white matte or concentrates which primarily consists of platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, ruthenium and 
associated metals (nickel, gold, copper, cobalt and silver) mined from the Great Dyke in Zimbabwe. The products are sold to 
one customer, Impala Refining Services Limited (IRS), a fellow subsidiary, under the terms of a contract. Revenue from the 
sale of white matte and concentrates is recognised when the product has been delivered to IRS where it is subject to further 
processing. Prices of the individual extracted minerals/metals are based on market prices. Quantities of the metals contained 
in the white matte and concentrates are obtained from the assay report results from both the Group and IRS and agreed by 
the two parties.
2.23
INTEREST INCOME
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method. When a loan and receivable is impaired, the Group reduces 
the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash flow discounted at the original effective 
interest rate of the instrument, and continues unwinding the discount as interest income. Interest income on impaired loan 
and receivables is recognised using the original effective interest rate.
2.24  DIVIDENDS
Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of 
the entity, on or before the end of the reporting date but not distributed at the reporting date.
Dividends declared after the reporting date but before the financial statements are issued are not recognised in the financial 
statements but are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
2.25  EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing:
• 
•
the profit or loss attributable to owners of the Company, excluding any costs of servicing equity other than ordinary shares; by
 the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial period, adjusted for bonus elements in 
ordinary shares issued during the period and excluding treasury shares.
Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account:
the after income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares, and
• 
• 
 the weighted average number of additional ordinary shares that would have been outstanding assuming the conversion 
of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
3.1
FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including price risk, currency risk and interest rate 
risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial 
markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s future financial performance. The primary objective of 
the financial risk management function is to establish risk limits and to ensure that risk stays within limits.
Risk management is carried out by the audit and risk committee under the policies approved by the board of directors. The 
audit and risk committee identifies and evaluates financial risks in close cooperation with management.
The board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as 
foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and investment of excess liquidity.
3.1.1  Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes 
in market prices. The Group’s market risks arise from open positions in foreign currencies, interest bearing liabilities and 
commodity prices to the extent that these are exposed to general and specific market movements.
(i) Price risk
Price risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk and currency risk whether those changes are caused by factors specific 
to the individual financial instrument or its issuer or factors affecting all financial instruments traded in the market. 
 
The Group is exposed to commodity price risk as trade receivables include pipeline sales amounting to US$125.9 million 
(2015: US$70.5 million) which will be revalued at future metal prices according to the sales contract with IRS. Metals sold, for 
which actual prices are not yet certain, are valued using spot prices at the reporting date with reference to the international 
market. The Group is therefore exposed to the risk of external price volatility (price takers).
The following demonstrates the sensitivity of pipeline sales included in trade receivables at the reporting date to a 10% 
(2015:5%) decrease/increase in metal prices to a possible change in prices on profitability:

(ii) Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is the risk arising from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and their effect on future commercial 
transactions or recognised assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s functional currency. The 
Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures on purchases that are denominated in 
currencies other than the US$, primarily with respect to contracts with suppliers of goods and services mainly denominated 
in the South African Rand (ZAR). The Group does not use forward exchange contracts to hedge its foreign currency risk. 
 
At 30 June 2016, if the currency had weakened/strengthened by 20% (2015:11%) against the South African Rand with all other 
variables held constant, post-tax profit for the period would have been US$1.18 million (2015: US$0.59 million) higher/lower, 
mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains/losses on translation of rand-denominated trade payables. Profit is more sensitive 
to movement in ZAR exchange rates in 2016 than 2015 because of the increased amount of ZAR denominated payables.
Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in 
market interest rates. Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of 
changes in market interest rates.   
 
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to 
cash flow interest rate risk. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.  All the Group’s 
borrowings are at variable interest rates and are denominated in United States Dollars.  A treasury committee meets each 
month to discuss various scenarios including cash flow forecasts and projections, allocations of funds and other treasury 
related  issues.  Various  scenarios  are  simulated  taking  into  consideration  refinancing,  renewal  of  existing  positions  and 
alternative financing.  The board approves all loans, including the interest rate terms, which are benchmarked against the 
London Inter- Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR).

For the Period Ended 30 June 2016 (continued)
3.1.2  Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss to the other party by failing to discharge 
a contract. Credit risk potentially arises from cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks or financial institutions and trade 
and other receivables. The Group’s cash and balances with banks are placed with high credit quality financial institutions. 
The sole customer of the Group is Impala Refining Services Limited based in South Africa, which is a fellow wholly owned 
subsidiary of Impala Platinum Holdings Limited, the majority shareholder. Based on historic default rates, there have been no 
impairments necessary (2015: US$ nil) against trade receivables, the credit quality of the sole customer is considered to be 
sound and management does not expect any losses from non-performance.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the statement of financial 
position. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk by class of financial asset is as follows:

Credit quality of financial assets
The credit quality of financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired can be assessed by reference to external credit 
ratings (if available) or to historical information about counterparty default rates:
Trade receivables
As all contractual terms have been complied with, trade receivables were fully performing and none were past due nor 
impaired as at 30 June 2016 (2015:US$nil).
Other financial assets
Credit risk relating to other financial assets comprises employee housing and car loans secured by a second bond over 
residential properties and certificate of title respectively. Ownership is only transferred after the loan has been paid in full. There 
is limited credit risk associated with loans and receivables from employees as repayments are deducted through payroll.
Cash and balances with banks 
The Group holds accounts with large financial institutions with sound capital and financial cover. The financial institutions 
holding cash and balances with banks have the following credit ratings:

3.1.3   Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may fail to meet its obligations when they fall due, the consequences of which may be 
the failure to meet obligations to creditors. The Group identifies this risk through periodic liquidity gap analysis and the maturity 
profile of assets and liabilities. Where major gaps appear, action is taken in advance to close or minimise the gaps. 
 
The treasury committee meets every month to review cash flow forecasts performed by the finance department. The finance 
department  monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational 
needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities as well as ensure that the Group 
does not breach borrowing limits or covenants (where applicable). Such forecasting takes into consideration the Group’s debt 
financing plans, covenant compliance and compliance with internal statement of financial position ratio targets.
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents, the availability of funding through 
an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
The table below analyses the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining 
period as at the statement of financial position to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows. Balances due within twelve months equal 
their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant. For borrowings, the cash flows have been estimated 
using the three months LIBOR applicable at the end of the reporting period.

The Group determines ideal weights for maturity time buckets which are used to benchmark the actual maturity profile. Maturity 
mismatches arising across the time buckets are managed through sales or advances from related parties. Mismatches arising from 
financing mismatches are managed through renewal of existing facilities.

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order 
to provide returns for shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce 
cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders or issue 
new shares.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net 
debt is calculated as total borrowings (including ‘current and non-current borrowings’ as shown in the statement of financial 
position) less cash and balances with banks. Total capital is calculated as ‘equity’ in the statement of financial position plus 
net debt.
The gearing ratios at 30 June 2016 and 2015 were as follows:

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
IFRS 13 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable 
or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources; unobservable inputs reflect the 
Group’s market assumptions. These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy:
Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. This level includes listed equity securities 
traded on active markets.
Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that 
is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices).
Level 3 - Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). This level includes 
equity investments and debt instruments with significant unobservable components. This level includes non-listed equity 
investments.
The hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. The Group considers relevant and observable 
market prices in its valuations where possible. The Group had no financial assets or financial liabilities carried at fair value as 
at 30 June 2016 (2015:US$nil).
Comparison of carrying amounts and fair values for assets and liabilities not held at fair value
The fair value is an estimate of the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following table summarises the fair value of financial 
assets and liabilities not measured at fair value on the entity’s statement of financial position.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. 
 
Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, 
seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below.
129
Notes to the Financial Statements
For the Period Ended 30 June 2016 (continued)
(a)
The preparation of the financial statements requires the Group’s management to make estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial 
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The determination of estimates 
requires the exercise of judgement based on various assumptions and other factors such as historical experience, current and 
expected economic conditions.
Carrying value of property plant and equipment
Various units-of-production (UOP) depreciation methodologies are available to management e.g. centares mined, tonnes 
mined, tonnes milled or ounces produced. Management elected to depreciate all mining and processing assets using the 
centares mined methodology.
For mobile and other equipment, the straight-line method is applied over the estimated useful life of the asset which does 
not exceed the estimated mine life based on proved and probable mineral reserves as the useful lives of these assets are 
considered to be limited to the life of the relevant mine.
The calculation of the UOP rate of depreciation will be impacted to the extent that actual production in the future is different 
from current forecast production based on proved and probable mineral reserves. This would generally result from changes 
in any of the factors or assumptions used in estimating mineral reserves. Changes in mineral reserves will similarly have an 
impact on the useful lives of assets depreciated on a straight-line basis, as these lives are limited to the life of the mine.
Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of cash flows of other assets. If 
there are indications that impairment may have occurred, estimates are prepared of expected future cash flows for each group 
of assets. Expected future cash flows used to determine the recoverable amount of tangible assets are inherently uncertain 
and could materially change over time.
They are significantly affected by resources, exploration potential and production estimates, together with economic factors 
such as spot and future metal prices, discount rates, foreign currency exchange rates, estimates of costs to produce reserves 
and future capital expenditure.
Impairment review
The  decline  in  metal  prices  during  the  year  triggered  an  impairment  assessment  of  property,  plant  and  equipment.  No 
impairment charge arose from the review. The recoverable amount of the cash generating unit (CGU) was determined based 
on value-in-use calculation for the existing mines which requires the use of assumptions regarding production volumes, costs 
of production, capital expenditure, metal prices and market forecasts for inflation and foreign exchange rates. The calculations 
used cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by the board covering a five-year period.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period were extrapolated using the estimated inflation rate stated below.
The discount rate is a risk adjusted discount rate, taking into account specific risks relating to the CGU.
Mineral Resources outside the approved mine plans were valued based on the in situ 4E ounce value. Comparable market 
transactions were used as a source of evidence adjusting specifically for the nature of each underlying ore body and the 
prevailing platinum price.
All the above estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties including future metal prices and exchange rates. It is therefore 
possible that changes can occur which may affect the recoverability of the property, plant and equipment.
130
Notes to the Financial Statements
For the Period Ended 30 June 2016 (continued)
The key financial assumptions used in the impairment calculations are:
•   Long-term real revenue per platinum ounce sold of US$1 262
•   Long-term discount rate - a range of 14% to 17%
•
Inflation rate of 2% per annum beyond the five-year period
Sensitivity analysis
•     A change of 10% in the value-in-use calculation would not result in impairment.
Change in estimates
During the course of the year, a desktop study was conducted to optimise the mining envelope and improve capital efficiency 
of the mines. The study recommended the extension of various mines so that more ore can be mined from the existing portals 
without compromising the stability of the mines. As a result, ore reserves for the former Portal 5S will now be mined from 
Bimha Mine main declines. The life of Bimha Mine has thus increased from 21 years at the beginning of the period ended 30 
June 2016 to 31 years.
The effects of the change in estimates on the Group’s depreciation expense charged in cost of sales and administration 
expenses during the period and future periods is shown below:

(b)
Production start date 
The Group assesses the stage of each mine construction project to determine when a mine moves into the production stage. 
The criteria used to assess the start date are determined based on the unique nature of each mine construction project, 
such as the complexity of a plant and its location. The Group considers various relevant criteria to assess when the mine is 
substantially complete, ready for its intended use and moves into the production stage.
(c)
(d)
Some of the criteria would include, but are not limited to the following:
the level of capital expenditure compared to the construction cost estimates
•  
•   completion of a reasonable period of testing of the mine plant and equipment
•   ability to produce metal in saleable form (within specifications)
•   ability to sustain on-going production of metal.
When a mine construction project moves into the production stage, the capitalisation of certain mine construction costs ceases 
and costs are either regarded as inventory or expensed, except for costs related to mining asset additions or improvements 
that are capitalised, underground mine development or mineable reserve development.
Income taxes (note 18, 28 and 34)
Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations 
for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The Group recognises liabilities for 
anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these 
matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred 
income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.
Ore, concentrates and matte inventories (note 8)
Costs that are incurred in or benefit the production process are accumulated as stockpiles, metal in process and product 
inventories. Net realisable value tests are performed annually and represent the estimated future sales price of the product 
based on prevailing metal prices, less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale.
131
Notes to the Financial Statements
For the Period Ended 30 June 2016 (continued)
(e)
(f)
(g)
Although the quantities of recoverable metal are reconciled by comparing the grades of ore to the quantities of metal actually 
recovered (metallurgical balancing), the nature of the process inherently limits the ability to precisely monitor recoverability 
levels. As a result, the metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and the engineering estimates are refined 
based on actual results over time.
Environmental rehabilitation provisions (note 16)
The Group’s mining and processing activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the 
environment. The Group recognises management’s best estimate for asset retirement obligations in the period in which they 
are incurred. Actual costs incurred in future periods can differ materially from the estimates. Additionally, future changes to 
environmental laws and regulations, life of mine estimates and discount rates can affect the carrying amount of this provision.
Estimated long-term environmental provisions, comprising pollution control, rehabilitation and mine closure, are based on the 
Group’s environmental policy taking into account current technological, environmental and regulatory requirements. Provisions 
for future rehabilitation costs have been determined, based on calculations which require the use of estimates.
The discount rate used was 7.6% (2015: 7.3%) at the time of the calculation. The net present value of the current rehabilitation 
estimates is based on the assumption of a long-term inflation rate of 2.0% (2015: 2.1%).
Ore Reserves estimation
The estimation of Ore Reserves impact the depreciation of property, plant and equipment, the recoverable amount of property, 
plant and equipment and the timing of environmental rehabilitation expenditure.
Factors impacting the determination of proved and probable reserves are:
•
the grade of Ore Reserves may vary significantly from time to time (i.e. differences between actual grades mined and 
resource model grades)
•  differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions
•  unforeseen operational issues at mine sites
•  changes in capital, operating, mining, processing and reclamation costs, discount rates and foreign exchange rates.
Revenue recognition (note 5)
The Group has recognised revenue amounting to US$471.8 million (2015: US$408.4 million) for metal sales to Impala Refining 
Services Limited (IRS). Sales to IRS are governed by a contract which stipulates when payments are to be received and the 
prices to be used. During the course of the year, assays performed by the Group are compared against those done by IRS 
and averages for both parties are used to determine sales volume. The Group believes that, based on past experience, these 
assays will not vary significantly.
In previous years, sales and cost of sales were measured over the year to 21 June in line with the Group’s metallurgical cut-off 
date. The Group decided to align the sales and cost of sales numbers with the financial year end of 30 June in the current 
period. This resulted in the current period consisting of 366 plus an extra 9 days of sales being included in revenue totalling 
US$3.5 million and US$3 million in cost of sales. The additional nine days sales of US$3.5 million had a 0.6% impact on gross 
profit of the Group.
At year end, deliveries to IRS not yet paid for (based on the lower of assays between IRS and the Group) are valued using 
spot prices at 30 June 2016. A 1% variation in assays will result in an adjustment of US$1.3 million (2015: US$0.7 million) 
in the income statement. The sensitivity of pipeline sales to changes in commodity prices is analysed above under 3.1.1. 
Appropriate adjustments will be made in the following year when they fall due for payment. Total sales for the year comprise 
current year sales and prior year adjustments.

Trade receivables comprise amounts due from Impala Refining Services Limited, a related party, for sales of white matte.
As all contractual terms and conditions have been complied with, trade receivables were fully performing as at 30 June
2016 (2015: US$ nil).
The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets and are not past due. Based on the 
credit history of these classes, it is expected that these amounts will be received when due.
The Group does not hold any collateral in relation to these receivables.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s trade and other receivables are all denominated in US$.
The fair value of trade and other receivables approximate the carrying values due to their short term nature.

Bank borrowings
Bank borrowings comprise a loan facility from Standard Bank of South Africa Limited for general business purposes. The loan is 
guaranteed by Impala Platinum Holdings Limited.
It is a revolving facility of US$95 million (2015:US$75 million) and bears interest at three months LIBOR plus 7% per annum. Capital 
repayments are required if the loan balance exceeds the available facility amount.
The Group renegotiated its agreement with Standard Bank of South Africa Limited in October 2015 to increase the revolving facility 
to US$95 million and change the repayment terms. This was not deemed a substantial modification of the terms of the existing 
financial liability to warrant accounting as an extinguishment of the original loan and recognition of a new loan in accordance 
with the provisions of IAS 39: Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement. The loan facility is repayable in two equal 
installments of US$47.5 million on 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2018 respectively. At the reporting date, the undrawn 
balance on the borrowing facility amounted to US$10 million (2015: US$ nil).
Revolving facility
The Group has a US$24 million revolving facility with Standard Bank of South Africa Limited for general working capital purposes. 
The facility bears interest at three months LIBOR plus 2.6% per annum and is secured by a cession of a portion of the Group’s 
trade receivables. The revolving facility matures on 30 November 2016. At the reporting date, the undrawn balance amounted to 
US$nil (2015: US$17 million).

Deferred income tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit 
through future taxable profits is probable. The Group recognised deferred income tax assets of US$3 million (2015: US$nil) in 
respect of tax losses amounting to US$19 million (2015: US$nil) that can be carried forward against future taxable income. 
 
Tax losses arising from mining operations in Zimbabwe do not expire in accordance with the Income Tax Act (Chapter 23:06).

Refund of royalty overpayment in prior periods 
 
The High Court of Zimbabwe issued its judgment in the case involving a dispute between Zimbabwe Platinum Mines (Private) 
Limited (the ‘operating subsidiary’) and the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA) on the mining royalty provisions applicable to the 
operating subsidiary. The judge ruled that the royalty provisions in the operating subsidiary’s mining agreement take precedence 
over the royalty provisions set out in the Finance Act (Chapter 23:04) and that accordingly the operating subsidiary is liable to pay 
royalties at a rate of 2.5% of the value of all minerals produced and not at the higher rates prescribed by the Finance Act (Chapter 
23:04). The effect of the judgment was that the operating subsidiary overpaid royalties by US$95.8 million in respect of the period 
between January 2004 and June 2014. The refund was realised during the period ended 30 June 2015.

Bimha Mine infrastructure and equipment 
Base Metal Refinery bankable feasibility and technical studies 
 
 
The collapse within a section of the underground working area of Bimha Mine triggered by the accelerated deterioration of ground 
conditions associated with the Mutambara Shear and the precautionary closure of Bimha Mine in August 2014, resulted in the 
damage and inaccessibility of certain underground infrastructure and equipment with a net carrying amount of US$22.9 million, 
which was written-off during the period ended 30 June 2015.
 
 
The decision to refurbish the mothballed base metal refinery at Selous Metallurgical Complex resulted in the impairment of US$15.6 
million incurred for the bankable feasibility and technical studies of a new base metal refinery becoming impaired as no future 
economic benefits were expected to flow to the entity.

The adjustment in respect of prior periods additional profits tax (APT) for the period ended 30 June 2015 relates to the judgement 
delivered by the Special Court for Income Tax Appeals in the case involving a dispute between the operating subsidiary and the 
Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA) on the issue of whether income tax assessed losses are allowable deductions for purposes 
of calculating additional profits tax. The judge found that an income tax assessed loss carried forward from a previous year of 
assessment, is not allowable as a deduction in computing APT. The effect of this judgment resulted in an additional liability of 
US$55.3 million for APT for the period from July 2004 to June 2014 for the operating subsidiary. The liability was recognised in the 
financial statements for the period ended 30 June 2015.

  During the period, the Group filed legal proceedings in the Special Court for Income Tax Appeals and the High Court of Zimbabwe 
in relation to various historical tax and customs duties matters and these cases are pending in the courts. The Group has on a 
without prejudice basis settled the disputed liabilities involved in these cases.
A service provider is seeking an order from the High Court of Zimbabwe that an alleged agreement between the Group and the 
service provider should be implemented, or alternatively, that the Group should pay damages to the amount of US$4 million.
While recognising the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, the directors believe, based upon current 
knowledge and after consulting with legal counsel, that the legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a 
material adverse effect on the financial position.
35  EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD

APPENDIX
SUMMARY OF AMENDMENTS TO THE MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION
Background
Set out below is a summary of the proposed changes to be made to the memorandum and articles of association of Zimplats to 
reflect certain changes brought about by amendments to The Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008, as amended (the ‘Companies Law’) 
and to generally update and amend certain definitions and other provisions. The following description is only being provided by way 
of summary of the principal changes. Shareholders are encouraged to review the proposed amended memorandum and articles of 
incorporation for the purposes of ascertaining the full extent of the changes.
The Companies Law came into effect on 1 July 2008. In accordance with The Companies (Transitional Provisions) Regulations, 
2008, as amended (the Transitional Regulations) Guernsey companies that were in existence under the old Companies (Guernsey) 
Law, 1994, as amended (the 1994 Law) were given until 1 July 2012 to ensure compliance with the new legislation, the Companies 
Law. These Transitional Regulations were extended until 31 December 2016 in order to allow sufficient time for the Companies Law 
amendments to come into force.
155
Notice of Annual General Meeting (continued)
Memorandum of Incorporation
It is proposed to amend Zimplat’s memorandum of association in order to reflect the updated provisions of the Companies Law, 
particularly section 15(7) of the Companies Law which allows for Zimplats to make further amendments to its memorandum of 
incorporation. Additionally the requirement for a share capital has been removed and provision has been made so that the company 
can pursue unrestricted objects following amendments to the Companies Law.
The proposed new memorandum of incorporation, which incorporates the amendments to the current memorandum of association, 
will be delivered to members. Once approved by the members, a copy of the new memorandum of incorporation will be lodged with 
the ASX and also located on the Company’s website.
Articles of Incorporation
The changes below aim to bring Zimplats’ articles of incorporation in line with the provisions of the Companies Law.
The current articles of association contain references to the SCH Business Rules, throughout. The SCH Business Rules have been 
repealed and replaced by the ASX Clear Operating Rules and the ASX Operating Settlement Rules. All references to the SCH Business 
Rules have been removed and replaced with wording which reflects the operation of the ASX Clear Operating Rules and the ASX 
Operating Settlement Rules.
The definition of ‘Proposed SCH Transfer’ has also been amended to reflect the repeal of the SCH Business Rules.
A  new  Article  1.3  (dealing  with  the  disapplication  of  the  standard  articles  of  incorporation  provided  by  the  States  of  Guernsey 
Commerce and Employment Department pursuant to section 16(2) of the Companies Law) has been inserted.
A new Article 2.4 (permitting Zimplats to acquire its own shares) has been inserted.
Article 7.4 of the current articles of association (dealing with the registration process on a transfer of shares) now also includes a 
reference to the Uncertificated Securities (Guernsey) Regulations, 2009, which provides that shares may be held in a computerised 
settlement system (as opposed to in certificated form).
A new Article 7.11(c) to reflect the ASX’s preference that the provisions of ASX Listing Rule 15.12.3 be replicated. In short, these 
provide that during a breach of the listing rules relating to restricted securities, or a breach of a restriction agreement, the holder of the 
restricted securities will not be entitled to any dividend or distribution, or voting rights, in respect of the restricted securities.
Article 9.1 of the current articles of association (dealing with the ability of Zimplats to alter its share capital by ordinary resolution) has 
been amended to reflect the current provisions of the Companies Law, which do not require a company to have a share capital and 
unless provided otherwise the directors have the power to issue shares.
Article 9.2 of the current articles of association (dealing with the reduction of share capital by special resolution) has been removed as 
it is no longer a part of the Companies Law as companies are no longer required to have an authorised share capital and as such the 
rules governing the maintenance of the same are covered in an individual company’s articles of incorporation. Additionally, under the 
provisions of the Companies Law, share buy backs are categorised as a form of “distribution”. The board of directors of a company 
may authorise a distribution if it is satisfied, on reasonable grounds, that the company will, immediately after the distribution, satisfy 
the solvency test as defined in the Companies Law.
156
Notice of Annual General Meeting (continued)
Article 14.2 of the current articles of association (dealing with the appointment of proxies or attorneys by shareholders) has been 
replaced to update the provisions to match the Companies Law, allowing appointments to be made through electronic means.
A new Article 25.3 (dealing with the duties of the Secretary) has been inserted to reflect those duties that are the responsibility of 
the Secretary failing the establishment of an agreement between the Company and the Secretary setting out the duties. Under the 
Companies Law the duties of the Secretary may be assigned by the Company’s Articles.
A new Article 27 (detailing the common signature of the Company) has been inserted.
Article 27 of the current articles of association (dealing with the Seals) has been renumbered as Article 28 of the new articles of 
incorporation.
Articles 28 and 29 of the current articles of association (dealing with provisions relating to the reserve fund and dividends and the 
capitalisation of profits) have been replaced by a new Article 30 (relating to dividends, distributions and reserves) following the adoption 
of the solvency regime established under the Companies Law, and to reflect that, pursuant to the Companies Law, the Company is 
no longer restricted to only paying dividends out of profits. Under the old 1994 Law, the repayment of share capital or the payment 
of dividends to shareholders were subject to complex rules. However, following the enactment of the Companies Law, as a general 
principle, distributions can be made or paid provided that any requirements set out in the company’s memorandum and articles of 
incorporation are complied with and the company satisfies a solvency test. As a part of this process the directors of the company 
must issue a certificate stating that in their opinion the company will, immediately after the distribution, satisfy the solvency test and 
the grounds for their opinion. The solvency test will be satisfied if the company is able to pay its debts as they become due, the value 
of the Company’s assets is greater than the value of its liabilities and, in the case of a supervised company, if it satisfies the various 
requirements laid down in other applicable laws.
A new Article 29 (dealing with the authentication of documents) has been inserted to assign power to authenticate documents of the 
Company to the Directors and Secretary or any person appointed by the board from time to time.
Article 30 of the current articles of association (dealing with accounts) has been renumbered as Article 31 in the new articles of 
incorporation.
A new Article 31.5 (dealing with the requirement for accounts to be audited) has been inserted under the renumbered Article 31 to 
reflect the ability of the company to waive the requirement under the Companies Law to have its accounts audited. A company can 
waive the requirement where it is not a ‘large’ company or it is a ‘small company’. A company is a large company where any two of the 
following conditions are met in a financial year and in the preceding financial year (and it is not also a ‘small’ company): the company 
has an annual net turnover of £6.5 million or greater, the company has a net balance sheet of £3.26 million or greater or the company
157
Notice of Annual General Meeting (continued)
has an average number of employees of 50 or more. A company is a ‘small’ company if it is dormant, an asset holding company 
(its principal purpose is to own specified assets of specified descriptions, it does not engage in trade, its activities are all directly 
connected with its ownership of those assets, it receives no significant income other than that derived directly from its ownership of 
those assets and it incurs no significant expenditure other than expenditure incidental to its ownership of those assets)  or it has 10 or 
fewer members (or it is a licensed insurer and a specific exemption applies).
Article 31 of the current articles of association (dealing with the appointment and removal of auditors) has been renumbered as Article 
32 in the new articles of incorporation.
Article  32  of  the  current  articles  of  association  (dealing  with  secrecy)  has  been  renumbered  as  Article  33  in  the  new  articles  of 
incorporation.
Article 33 of the current articles of association (dealing with notices) has been replaced by a new Article 34 to reflect the updated notice 
requirements under the Companies Law, including the deemed service provisions and the ability to give notice by electronic means.
Article 34 of the current articles of association (dealing with winding up) has been renumbered as Article 35 in the new articles of 
incorporation. Article 34.2 of the current articles of association has been deleted to reflect freedom given by the new Article 35.1 to a 
liquidator to determine how a division is to be carried out as between members, which could include the amount paid up on an individual’s 
shares (as provided for in Article 34.2 of the current articles) but also could include other matters with the removal of Article 34.2.
Article 35 of the current articles of association (dealing with officers: indemnities and insurance) has been renumbered as Article 36 in 
the new articles of incorporation.
The proposed new articles of incorporation, which incorporate the amendments to the current articles of association, will be delivered 
to members. Once approved by the members, a copy of the new articles of incorporation will be lodged with the ASX and also located 
on the Company’s website.

Directors’ Responsibilities 
The Directors, being the responsible party, are responsible for the selection, preparation and presentation of the sustainability information 
subject to assurance in accordance with the GRI G4 Guidelines and management’s internally developed criteria, for selection of reporting 
criteria that are appropriate for the purpose of reporting the sustainability information in the Report, and for ensuring that those criteria 
are available / made available (as applicable) to the users of the Report. This responsibility includes ensuring that:
►
stakeholders and stakeholder requirements, material issues, and commitments with respect to sustainability and carbon footprint 
performance are identified;
►  Zimplats’ sustainability context responds to the principles of materiality, stakeholder inclusivity and completeness; and
►
the  Report  contains  Zimplats  sustainability  information  reported  in  accordance  with  the  GRI  G4  (Core)  Guidelines  including 
management’s assertion in the Report that Zimplats has prepared the Report in accordance with the GRI G4 (Core) Guidelines.
The  Directors  are  also  responsible  for  determining  Zimplats’  objectives  in  respect  of  reporting  sustainability  information  and  for 
establishing and maintaining appropriate information systems and related internal controls to enable preparation and presentation of 
the sustainability information subject to assurance free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
165
Independent Limited Assurance Report in relation to Selected Sustainability 
Disclosures and Key Performance Indicators presented in Zimplats Holdings 
Limited’s Integrated Annual Report for the year ended 30 June 2016
The  Directors  are  also  responsible  for  the  preparation  of  the  information  pertaining  to  specified  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in 
accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A corporate accounting and reporting standard (GHG Protocol).
In  addition,  the  Directors’  responsibility  includes  the  design,  implementation  and  maintenance  of  internal  control  relevant  to  the 
preparation of the information on specified greenhouse gas emissions, and the preparation and presentation of the selected KPIs in 
the Report, free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.
Inherent Limitations 
Non-financial performance information is subject to inherent limitations given the characteristics of the subject matter and the methods 
used for determining, calculating, sampling and estimating such information.
GHG quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty because of incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine emissions factors 
and the values needed to combine emissions of different gases.
Our Independence and Quality Control
We have complied with the independence and all other ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued 
by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, 
professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.
Ernst & Young Inc. applies the International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of 
quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards 
and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
Our Responsibility
Our  responsibility  is  to  perform  the  assurance  engagement  and  to  express  our  limited  assurance  conclusion  based  on  the  work 
performed, stating whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the selected KPIs as presented the Report 
are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the GRI G4 Guidelines and the Criteria for reporting the selected KPIs.
We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 
3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and ISAE 3410, Assurance 
Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. These Standards 
require us to comply with ethical requirements and to plan and perform our engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether 
the selected sustainability disclosures and KPIs are free from material misstatement.
A limited assurance engagement undertaken in accordance with these standards involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances 
of Zimplats’ use of the GRI G4 Guidelines and management’s internally developed reporting criteria as the basis of preparation of the 
sustainability information subject to assurance, assessing the risks of material misstatement of the selected sustainability disclosures 
and KPIs, whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances, and evaluating the 
overall presentation of the selected sustainability disclosures and KPIs. A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope 
than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal 
control, and the procedures that will be performed in response to the assessed risks.
The procedures we performed were  based on our professional judgement and  included inquiries, observation of processes followed, 
inspection of documents, analytical procedures, evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods and reporting policies, and 
agreeing or reconciling with underlying records.
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above we:
•
Interviewed management and senior executives to obtain an understanding of the internal control environment, risk assessment 
process and their selection and application of sustainability reporting policies relevant to the sustainability reporting process; 
Inspected documentation to corroborate the statements of management and senior executives in our interviews;
• 
•  Tested  the processes and systems to generate, collate, aggregate, monitor and report the selected KPIs;
•
Inspected supporting documentation on a sample basis and performed analytical procedures to evaluate the data generation and 
reporting processes against the reporting criteria;
 Evaluated  the  reasonableness  and  appropriateness  of  significant  estimates  and  judgements  made  by  the  directors  in  the 
preparation of the selected KPIs; and
 Evaluated  whether  the  selected  KPIs  presented  in  the  Report  is  consistent  with  our  overall  knowledge  and  experience  of 
sustainability management and performance at Zimplats Holdings Limited.

Independent Limited Assurance Report in relation to Selected Sustainability 
Disclosures and Key Performance Indicators presented in Zimplats Holdings 
Limited’s Integrated Annual Report for the year ended 30 June 2016
Our procedures did not include testing controls or performing procedures in relation to checking aggregation or calculation of data 
within IT systems, which would have been performed under a reasonable assurance engagement.
The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable 
assurance engagement. As a result, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the 
assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement. Accordingly, we do not express 
a reasonable assurance opinion about whether the sustainability information subject to assurance has been presented, in all material 
respects, in accordance with the Criteria.
We are not responsible for reporting on any transactions or events related to the sustainability information subject to assurance 
beyond the period covered by our limited assurance engagement.
Limited Assurance Conclusion 
Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us 
to believe that the selected KPIs identified above in the subject matter paragraph, as presented in the Report are not prepared, in all 
material respects, in accordance with the Criteria.
Other Matters 
Our report does not extend to any disclosures or assertions relating to future performance plans and / or strategies disclosed in the 
Report.
The maintenance and integrity of Zimplats Holdings Limited’s website is the responsibility of management of Zimplats. Our procedures 
did not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly we accept no responsibility for any changes either to the selected 
sustainability disclosures and KPI information as presented in the Report or to our report for our independent limited assurance 
engagement that may have occurred since the initial date of presentation on the Zimplats website.
Restriction of Liability 
Our work has been undertaken to enable us to express a limited assurance conclusion on the selected sustainability disclosures and 
KPIs, to the Directors of Zimplats in accordance with the terms of our engagement, and for no other purpose. We do not accept or 
assume liability to any party other than Zimplats Holdings Limited, for our work, for this report, or for the conclusion we have reached.

Ore Reserve
Defined in the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore 
Reserves (the JORC Code) 2012 edition  a ‘mineral resource’ is a concentration or occurrence of 
solid material of economic interest in or on the earth’s crust in such form, grade (or quality), and 
quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, 
grade (or quality), continuity and other geological characteristics of a mineral resource are known, 
estimated  or  interpreted  from  specific  geological  evidence  and  knowledge,  including  sampling. 
Mineral  resources  are  sub-divided,  in  order  of  increasing  geological  confidence,  into  inferred, 
indicated and measured categories.
Mineral resources are subdivided into measured, indicated and inferred categories as follows:-
A ‘measured mineral resource’ - is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity, grade (or 
quality), densities, shape, and physical characteristics are estimated with confidence sufficient to 
allow  the  application  of  modifying  factors  to  support  detailed  mine  planning  and  final  evaluation 
of the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from detailed and reliable 
exploration, sampling and testing gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as 
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes,and is sufficient to confirm geological and grade (or 
quality) continuity between points of observation where data and samples are gathered.
A measured mineral resource  has  a  higher  level  of  confidence  than  that  applying  to  either  an 
indicated mineral resource or an inferred mineral resource. It may be converted to a proved ore 
reserve
An ‘indicated mineral resource’ is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity, grade (or 
quality), densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with sufficient confidence to 
allow the application of modifying factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation 
of the economic viability of the deposit.
Geological  evidence  is  derived  from  adequately  detailed  and  reliable  exploration,  sampling  and 
testing gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, 
workings  and  drill  holes,  and  is  sufficient  to  assume  geological  and  grade  (or  quality)  continuity 
between points of observation where data and samples are gathered.
An indicated mineral resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to a measured 
mineral resource and may only be converted to a probable ore reserve.
An ‘inferred mineral resource’ is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade (or 
quality) are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. Geological evidence is 
sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade (or quality) continuity. It is based on exploration, 
sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as 
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.
An inferred mineral resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to an indicated mineral 
resource and must not be converted to an ore reserve. It is reasonably expected that the majority 
of  inferred  mineral  resources  could  be  upgraded  to  indicated  mineral  resources  with  continued 
exploration.
Main Sulphide Zone – a thin layer of crystalline igneous rock containing small amounts of sulphide  
minerals located near the top of the ultramafic igneous sequence which forms the lower part of the 
Hartley Geologic Complex.
Chemical symbol for nickel
The average amount of the valuable metal or mineral contained in a specific mass of ore.
Defined in the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore 
Reserves  (the  JORC  Code)  2012  edition  an  ‘Ore  Reserve’  is  the  economically  mineable  part  of 
a  measured  and/or  indicated  mineral  resource.  It  includes  diluting  materials  and  allowances  for 
losses, which may occur when the material is mined or extracted and is defined by studies at pre-
feasibility or feasibility level as appropriate that include application of modifying factors. Such studies 
demonstrate that, at the time of reporting, extraction could reasonably be justified.

General Information (continued)
Pd
Ore reserves are subdivided into proved and probable categories as follows:-
 
 A ‘proved ore reserve’ is the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource. A proved 
ore reserve implies a high degree of confidence in the modifying factors.
A ‘probable ore reserve’ is the economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in some circumstances, 
a measured mineral resource. The confidence in the modifying factors applying to a probable ore 
reserve is lower than that applying to a proved ore reserve.
Chemical symbol for palladium
Peak platinum value
This  is  the  highest  platinum  value  in  the  mineralisation  and  coincides  with  a  sharp  decrease  in 
sulphide content and grain size.

The final stage of metal production in which the various base and precious metals contained in the 
white matte are separated from each other, by a wide variety of hydrometallurgical processes, to 
produce individual metals and/or metal salts of saleable purity.
Chemical symbol for rhodium
Run-of-mine
Room and pillar mining
As practised at Zimplats, mining takes place on the reef horizon only. The main access declines are 
mined on dip and from these access declines, drives (rooms) are developed on strike.  A series of 
in-situ reef pillars are left between these mined out rooms to help support the mine roof and control 
the flow of air.  Generally, rooms are five to seven metres wide and the pillars up to 35 metres wide. 
As mining advances, a grid-like pattern of rooms and pillars is formed.
