<p><b>  17/&#8230; The negative impact of the non-repatriation of funds of illicit

 rights   
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Guided</i> by the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime as 
well as other relevant human rights instruments,  
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the commitment to ensure the effective enjoyment by all of all human 
rights, civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to 
development, and the obligation of all States, regardless of their political, economic and 
cultural systems, to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolutions 54/205 of 22 December 1999, on the 
prevention of corrupt practices and illegal transfer of funds, 55/61 of 4 December 2000, on 
an effective international legal instrument against corruption, and 55/188 of 20 December 
2000, on preventing and combating corrupt practices and illegal transfer of funds and 
repatriation of such funds to the countries of origin, as well as the report of the meeting of 
the Intergovernmental Open-Ended Expert Group to Prepare Draft Terms of Reference for 
the Negotiation of an International Legal Instrument against Corruption, which will be 
considered by the Economic and Social Council at its next session,  
</p>
<p> <i>Concerned </i>about the seriousness of problems posed by corrupt practices and transfer 
of funds of illicit origin, which may endanger the stability and security of societies, 
undermine the values of democracy and morality and jeopardize social, economic and 
political development,  
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned </i>that the enjoyment of human rights, be they economic, social and 
cultural, or civil and political, in particular the right to development, is seriously 
undermined by the phenomenon of corruption and the transfer of funds of illicit origin, 
</p>
<p> <i>Convinced</i> that the illicit acquisition of personal wealth can be particularly damaging 
to democratic institutions, national economies and the rule of law, 
</p>

<p> 1. <i>Expresses grave concern</i> about cases of corruption that involve vast 
quantities of assets, which may constitute a substantial proportion of the resources of States, 
the deprivation of which threatens the political stability and sustainable development of 
those States;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Recognizes</i> the urgent need to repatriate such illicit funds to the countries of 
origin without any conditionalities;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Requests</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
prepare a comprehensive study on the negative impact of the non-repatriation of funds of 
illicit origin to the countries of origin on the enjoyment of human rights, in particular 
economic, social and cultural rights, and to submit a report thereon to the Human Rights 
Council at its nineteenth session.
