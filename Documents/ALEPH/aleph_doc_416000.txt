United States Tax Considerations
The Parties intend that the series of transactions contemplated in Sections 3.1(aaa) through 3.1(iii)

intended  to  constitute  a  "plan  of  reorganization"  within  the  meaning  of  Treasury  Regulation  Section  1.368-2(g).  
Each  Party  agrees  that  it  shall  (a)  treat  the  Combination  Transactions  as  a  single  integrated  transaction  for  U.S. 
federal income tax purposes, (b) treat the Combination Transactions as a single integrated transaction that qualifies 
as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1) of the Code, and (c) retain such records and file such 
information  as  is  required  to  be  retained  and  filed  pursuant  to  Treasury  Regulation  Section  1.368-3  in  connection 
with  the  Combination  Transactions.    Excluding  the  transactions  contemplated  by  this  Agreement  and  the  Plan  of 
Arrangement, no Party shall take any action, fail to take any action, cause any action to be taken or cause any action 
to fail to be taken that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Combination Transactions, considered together 
as a single integrated transaction, from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1) of 
the Code with respect to Viking and the Viking Unitholders.
2.9
Post-Closing Wind-up

MFCorp, HST, ERIK and VHT as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Date and in any event within 
twelve (12) months following the Effective Date, and Harvest shall cause each of Viking, MFCorp, HST, ERIK and 
VHT not to engage in any business following the Effective Date.

soon  as  reasonably  practicable  following  the  Effective  Date  and,  in  connection  therewith,  Harvest  or  one  of  its 
Subsidiaries  (other  than  HOC)  shall  exercise  the  overriding  redemption  call  right  held  by  Harvest  pursuant  to  the

Each Party shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions and negotiations 
(including,  without  limitation,  through  any  advisors  or  other  parties  on  its  behalf),  if  any,  with  any 
parties conducted before the date of this Agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and shall 
immediately request the return or destruction of all information provided to any third parties who have 
entered into a confidentiality agreement with such Party relating to an Acquisition Proposal and shall 
use all reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that such requests are honoured.
Neither  Party  shall,  directly  or  indirectly,  do  or  authorize  or  permit  any  of  its  officers,  directors  or 
employees  or  any  financial  advisor,  expert  or  other  representative  retained  by  it  to  do,  any  of  the

(i)
(ii)

operations, prospects or conditions (financial or otherwise) in connection with an Acquisition

provided,  however,  that  notwithstanding  any  other  provision  hereof,  each  Party  and  its  officers, 
directors and advisers may:
(v)
enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with a third party who (without any 
solicitation, initiation or encouragement, directly or indirectly, after the date of this Agreement, 
by such Party or any of its officers, directors or employees or any financial advisor, expert or
D-28
other  representative  retained  by  it)  seeks  to  initiate  such  discussions  or  negotiations  and, 
subject  to  execution  of  a  confidentiality  and  standstill  agreement  substantially  similar  to  the 
Confidentiality  Agreement  (provided  that  such  confidentiality  agreement  shall  provide  for 
disclosure thereof (along with all information provided thereunder) to the other Party as set out 
below),  may  furnish  to  such  third  party  information  concerning  such  Party  and  its  business, 
properties and assets, in each case if, and only to the extent that:
(A)
(B)
the  third  party  has  first  made  a  written  bona  fide  Acquisition  Proposal  which  the 
board of directors of the administrator of such Party determines in good faith: (1) that 
funds or other consideration necessary for the Acquisition Proposal are or are likely to 
be available; (2) (after consultation with its financial advisor) would, if consummated 
in  accordance  with  its  terms,  result  in  a  transaction  financially  superior  for 
securityholders  of  the  Receiving  Party  than  the  transaction  contemplated  by  this 
Agreement;  and  (3)  after  receiving  the  advice  of  outside  counsel  as  reflected  in 
minutes of the board of directors of the administrator of such Party, that the taking of 
such action is necessary for the board of directors in discharge of its fiduciary duties 
under Applicable Laws (a "Superior Proposal"); and
prior  to  furnishing  such  information  to  or  entering  into  or  participating  in  any  such 
discussions or negotiations with such third party, such Party provides prompt notice 
to the other Party to the effect that it is furnishing information to or entering into or 
participating in discussions or negotiations with such Person together with a copy of 
the confidentiality agreement referenced above and if not previously provided to the 
other Party, copies of all information provided to such third party concurrently with 
the provision of such information to such third party, and provided further that such 
Party  shall  notify  the  other  Party  orally  and  in  writing  of  any  inquiries,  offers  or 
proposals  with  respect  to  a  Superior  Proposal  (which  written  notice  shall  include, 
without limitation, a copy of any such proposal (and any amendments or supplements 
thereto), the identity of the Person making it, if not previously provided to the other 
Party,  copies  of  all  information  provided  to  such  Party  and  all  other  information 
reasonably requested by the other Party), within 24 hours of the receipt thereof, shall 
keep  the other  Party  informed  of  the  status  and  details  of  any  such  inquiry,  offer  or 
proposal and answer the other Party's questions with respect thereto; or
(vi)
(vii)
comply  with  Section 172  of  the  Securities  Act  (Alberta)  and  similar  provisions  under 
Applicable Canadian Securities Laws relating to the provision of directors' circulars and make 
appropriate disclosure with respect thereto to its securityholders; and
accept, recommend, approve or enter into an agreement to implement a Superior Proposal from 
a  third  party,  but  only  if  prior  to  such  acceptance,  recommendation,  approval  or 
implementation, the board of directors of its administrator shall have concluded in good faith, 
after  considering  all  proposals  to  adjust  the  terms  and  conditions  of  this  Agreement  as 
contemplated by Section 3.4(c) and after receiving the advice of outside counsel as reflected in 
minutes of the board of directors of such Party, that the taking of such action is necessary for 
the  board  of  directors  in  discharge  of  its  fiduciary  duties  under  Applicable  Laws  and  such 
Party complies with its obligations set forth in Section 3.4(c) and terminates this Agreement in 
accordance with Section 9.1(e) or Section 91(f), as applicable, and concurrently therewith pays 
the amount required by Section 7.1 or 7.2, as applicable, to the other Party.
(c)
Each  Party  in  receipt  of  a  Superior  Proposal  (a  "Receiving  Party")  shall  give  the  other  Party  (the 
"Responding  Party"),  orally  and  in  writing,  at  least  72  hours  advance  notice  of  any  decision  by  the 
board  of  directors  of  its  administrator  to  accept,  recommend,  approve  or  enter  into  an  agreement  to 
implement  a  Superior  Proposal,  which  notice  shall  confirm  that  the  board  of  directors  of  the 
administrator  of  the  Receiving  Party  has  determined  that  such  Acquisition  Proposal  constitutes  a 
Superior Proposal, shall identify the third party making the Superior Proposal and shall provide a true
D-29
and  complete  copy  thereof  and  any  amendments  thereto.  During  such  72  hour  period,  the  Receiving 
Party  agrees  not  to  accept,  recommend,  approve  or  enter  into  any  agreement  to  implement  such 
Superior  Proposal  and  not  to  release  the  party  making  the  Superior  Proposal  from  any  standstill 
provisions  and  shall  not  withdraw,  redefine,  modify  or  change  its  recommendation  in  respect  of  the 
Arrangement.  In  addition,  during  such  72  hour  period  the  Receiving  Party  shall  and  shall  cause  its 
financial and legal advisors to, negotiate in good faith with the Responding Party and its financial and 
legal  advisors  to  make  such  adjustments  in  the  terms  and  conditions  of  this  agreement  and  the 
Arrangement as would enable the Receiving Party to proceed with the Arrangement as amended rather 
than the Superior Proposal. In the event the Responding Party proposes to amend this agreement and the 
Arrangement to provide that the holders of the Harvest Securities or Viking Units, as applicable, (the 
"Receiving Party Securities") shall receive a value per Receiving Party Security equal to or having a 
value  greater  than  the  value  per  Receiving  Party  Security  provided  in  the  Superior  Proposal  and  so 
advises the board of directors of the administrator of the Receiving Party prior to the expiry of such 72 
hour  period,  the  board  of  directors  of  the  administrator  of  the  Receiving  Party  shall  not  accept, 
recommend,  approve  or  enter  into  any  agreement  to  implement  such  Superior  Proposal  and  shall  not 
release the party making the Superior Proposal from any standstill provisions and shall not withdraw, 
redefine, modify or change its recommendation in respect of the Arrangement.
Each Party agrees that all information that may be provided to it by the other Party with respect to any 
Superior Proposal pursuant to this Section 3.4 shall be treated as if it were "Confidential Information"
as  that  term  is  defined  in  the  Confidentiality  Agreement  and  shall  not  be  disclosed  or  used  except  in 
accordance with the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement or in order to enforce its rights under 
this Agreement in legal proceedings.
Each Party shall ensure that its officers, directors and employees and any investment bankers or other 
advisers or representatives retained by it are aware of the provisions of this Section 3.4. Harvest shall be 
responsible for any breach of this Section 3.4 by its officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, 
advisers  or  representatives,  and  Viking  shall  be  responsible  for  any  breach  of  this  Section 3.4  by  its 
officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, advisers or representatives.

after  the  date  hereof  that  would  be  relevant  and  material  to  a  prudent  operator  of  the  business  and 
operations of Viking.  Viking shall confer with and obtain Harvest's approval (not to be unreasonably 
withheld  or  delayed),  prior  to  taking  action  (other  than  in  emergency  situations)  with  respect  to  any 
material operational matters involved in its business.
From  and  after  the  date  hereof,  Harvest  shall  provide  Viking  and  its  representatives  access,  during 
normal business hours and at such other time or times as Viking may reasonably request, to its premises

Parties.

contained herein to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or (ii) result in the failure to comply 
with  or  satisfy  any  covenant,  condition  or  agreement  to  be  complied  with  or  satisfied  by  any  Party

If any of the conditions precedents set forth in Sections 6.1, 6.2 or 6.3 hereof shall not be complied with 
or waived by the Party or Parties for whose benefit such conditions are provided on or before the date

Agreement; provided that, prior to the filing of the Articles of Arrangement for the purpose of giving 
effect to the Arrangement, the Party intending to rely thereon has delivered a written notice to the other 
Party, specifying in reasonable detail all breaches of covenants, representations and warranties or other 
matters  which  the  Party  delivering  such  notice  is  asserting  as  the  basis  for  the  non-fulfillment  of  the

AGREEMENT AS TO DAMAGES AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS
ARTICLE 7
7.1
Harvest Damages
If at any time after the execution of this Agreement and prior to its termination:
(a)
the Viking Board of Directors has withdrawn or changed any of its recommendations or determinations 
referred to in Sections 3.2(p) and 5.2(zz) in a manner adverse to Harvest or shall have resolved to do so 
prior to the Effective Date;
D-56
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
a  bona  fide  Acquisition  Proposal  is  publicly  announced,  proposed,  offered  or  made  to  the  Viking 
Unitholders  or  to  Viking  and  the  Viking  Unitholders  do  not  approve  the  Arrangement  or  the 
Arrangement is not submitted for their approval;
Viking accepts, recommends, approves or enters into an agreement to implement a Superior Proposal; 
or
Viking is in breach of any of its covenants made in this Agreement which breach individually or in the 
aggregate causes or would reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Change with respect to 
Viking or materially impedes the completion of the Arrangement, and Viking fails to cure such breach 
within five business days after receipt of written notice thereof from Harvest (except that no cure period 
shall  be  provided  for  a  breach  which  by  its  nature  cannot  be  cured  and,  in  no  event,  shall  any  cure 
period extend beyond March 31, 2006) or
Viking is in breach of any of its representations or warranties made in this Agreement (without giving 
effect  to  any  materiality  qualifiers  contained  therein)  which  breach  individually  or  in  the  aggregate 
causes or would reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Change with respect to Viking or 
materially impedes the completion of the Arrangement, and Viking fails to cure such breach within five 
business days after receipt of written notice thereof from Harvest (except that no cure period shall be 
provided for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured and, in no event, shall any cure period extend 
beyond March 31, 2006),
(each  of  the  above  being  a  "Harvest  Damages  Event"),  then  in  the  event  of  the  termination  of  this  Agreement 
pursuant  to  Section  9.1,  Viking  shall  pay  to  Harvest  $65  million  (the  "Harvest  Termination  Fee")  as  liquidated 
damages in immediately available funds to an account designated by Harvest within one business day after the first 
to occur of the events described above; provided, however, that if the sole reason that the Harvest Termination Fee 
becomes payable is because of a breach of a representation or warranty that is not cured as contemplated in Section 
7.1(e) , the Harvest Termination Fee shall be reduced to $10 million.  Following a Harvest Damages Event but prior 
to  payment  of  the  applicable  Harvest  Termination  Fee,  Viking  shall  be  deemed  to  hold  such  applicable  Harvest 
Termination Fee in trust for Harvest.  Viking shall only be obligated to pay one Harvest Termination Fee pursuant to 
this Section 7.1.
7.2
Viking Damages
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
If at any time after the execution of this Agreement and prior to its termination:
the Harvest Board of Directors has withdrawn or changed any of its recommendations or determinations 
referred to in Sections 3.1(o) and 5.1(yy) in a manner adverse to Viking or shall have resolved to do so 
prior to the Effective Date;
a  bona  fide  Acquisition  Proposal  is  publicly  announced,  proposed,  offered  or  made  to  the  Harvest 
Unitholders  or  to  Harvest  and  the  Harvest  Securityholders  do  not  approve  the  Arrangement  or  the 
Arrangement is not submitted for their approval;
Harvest accepts, recommends, approves or enters into an agreement to implement a Superior Proposal; 
or
Harvest is in breach of any of its covenants made in this Agreement which breach individually or in the 
aggregate causes or would reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Change with respect to 
Harvest or materially impedes the completion of the Arrangement, and Harvest fails to cure such breach 
within five business days after receipt of written notice thereof from Viking (except that no cure period 
shall  be  provided  for  a  breach  which  by  its  nature  cannot  be  cured  and,  in  no  event,  shall  any  cure 
period extend beyond March 31, 2006); or
D-57
(e)
Harvest is in breach of any of its representations or warranties made in this Agreement (without giving 
effect  to  any  materiality  qualifiers  contained  therein)  which  breach  individually  or  in  the  aggregate 
causes or would reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Change with respect to Harvest or 
materially  impedes  the  completion  of  the  Arrangement,  and  Harvest  fails  to  cure  such  breach  within 
five business days after receipt of written notice thereof from Viking (except that no cure period shall 
be  provided  for  a  breach  which  by  its  nature  cannot  be  cured  and,  in  no  event,  shall  any  cure  period 
extend beyond March 31, 2006),
(each  of  the  above  being  a  "Viking  Damages  Event"),  then  in  the  event  of  the  termination  of  this  Agreement 
pursuant  to  Section 9.1,  Harvest  shall  pay  to  Viking  $65  million  (the  "Viking  Termination  Fee")  as  liquidated 
damages in immediately available funds to an account designated by Viking within one business day after the first to 
occur  of  the  events  described  above;  provided,  however,  that  if  the  sole  reason  that  the  Viking  Termination  Fee 
becomes  payable  is  because  of  a  breach  of  a  representation  or  warranty  that  is  not  cured  as  contemplated  in 
Section 7.2(e), the Viking Termination Fee shall be reduced to $10 million.  Following a Viking Damages Event but 
prior to payment of the applicable Viking Termination Fee, Harvest shall be deemed to hold such applicable Viking 
Termination Fee in trust for Viking.  Harvest shall only be obligated to pay one Viking Termination Fee pursuant to 
this Section 7.2.
7.3
Liquidated Damages
Each Party acknowledges that all of the payment amounts set out in this Article 7 are payments of 
liquidated damages which are a genuine pre-estimate of the damages which the Party entitled to such damages will 
suffer or incur as a result of the event giving rise to such damages and resultant termination of this Agreement and 
are not penalties. Each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise as a defence that any such liquidated 
damages are excessive or punitive. For greater certainty, the Parties agree that the payment of the applicable amount 
pursuant  to  this  Article 7  is  the  sole  monetary  remedy  of  the  Party  receiving  such  payment.  Nothing  herein  shall 
preclude  a  Party  from  seeking  injunctive  relief  to  restrain  any  breach  or  threatened  breach  of  the  covenants  or 
agreements set forth in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement or otherwise to obtain specific performance 
of  any  of  such  act,  covenants  or  agreements,  without  the  necessity  of  posting  bond  or  security  in  connection 
therewith.
8.1

given in the same manner as required for the approval of the Arrangement or as may be ordered by the Court.

Securities and Viking Units shall be treated as if the holder had participated in the Arrangement on the same basis as 
a non dissenting holder of Harvest Securities and Viking Units notwithstanding the provisions of Section 191 of the 
ABCA.  The fair value of the Harvest Securities and Viking Units shall be determined as of the close of business on 
the last business day before the day on which the Arrangement is approved by the holders of Harvest Securities and 
Viking Units at the applicable Meeting; but in no event shall Harvest, Viking or Operations be required to recognize 
such Dissenting  Securityholder  as a Securityholder of Harvest, Viking or Operations after the Effective Time and 
the name of such holder shall be removed from the applicable register of Securityholders as at the Effective Time.  
For greater certainty, in addition to any other restrictions in section 191 of the ABCA, no person who has voted in 
favour of the Arrangement shall be entitled to dissent with respect to the Arrangement.

Units that were exchanged pursuant to Section 3.1 shall represent only the right to receive the consideration to which 
the holders are entitled under the Arrangement, or as to those held by Dissenting Securityholders, other than those 
Dissenting Securityholders deemed to have participated in the Arrangement pursuant to Section 4.1, to receive the 
fair value of the Harvest Securities and Viking Units represented by such certificates.
5.2  Harvest and Viking shall, as soon as practicable following the later of the Effective Date and the date of deposit 
by a former holder of Harvest Exchangeable Shares and Viking Units of a duly completed Letter of Transmittal and 
the certificates representing such Harvest Exchangeable Shares and Viking Units, either:
(a)
forward or cause to be forwarded by first class mail (postage prepaid) to such former holder at the 
address specified in the Letter of Transmittal; or
D-81
(b)
if  requested  by  such  holder  in  the  Letter  of  Transmittal,  make  available  or  cause  to  be  made 
available at the Depositary for pickup by such holder,
certificates representing the number of Harvest Units to be delivered to such holder under the Arrangement.
5.3  If any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented an interest in outstanding Harvest 
Exchangeable Shares or Viking Units that were exchanged pursuant to Section 3.1 has been lost, stolen or destroyed, 
upon  the  making  of  an  affidavit  of  that  fact  by  the  person  claiming  such  certificate  to  have  been  lost,  stolen  or 
destroyed,  the  Depositary  shall  issue  and  deliver  in  exchange  for  such  lost  stolen  or  destroyed  certificate  the 
consideration to which the holder is entitled pursuant to the Arrangement (and any dividends or distributions with 
respect  thereto)  as  determined  in  accordance  with  the  Arrangement.    The  person  who  is  entitled  to  receive  such 
consideration shall, as a condition precedent to the receipt thereof, give a bond to each of Harvest and Viking and 
their respective transfer agents, which bond is in form and substance satisfactory to each of the Harvest and Viking 
and  their  respective  transfer  agents, or  shall  otherwise  indemnify  Harvest  and Viking  and  their  respective  transfer 
agents against any claim that may be made against any of them with respect to the certificate alleged to have been 
lost, stolen or destroyed.
5.4  All  distributions  made  with  respect  to  any  Harvest  Units  allotted  and  issued  to  former  holders  of  Harvest 
Exchangeable Shares and Viking Units pursuant to this Arrangement but for which a certificate has not been issued 
shall be paid or delivered to the Depositary to be held by the Depositary in trust for the registered holder thereof.  
The  Depositary  shall  pay  and  deliver  to  any  such  registered  holder,  as  soon  as  reasonably  practicable  after 
application  therefor  is  made  by  the  registered  holder  to  the  Depositary  in  such  form  as  the  Depositary  may 
reasonably  require,  such  distributions  to  which  such  holder,  is  entitled,  net  of  applicable  withholding  and  other 
taxes.
5.5  Any certificate formerly representing Harvest Exchangeable Shares or Viking Units that is not deposited with 
all other documents as required by this Plan of Arrangement on or before the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date 
shall  cease  to  represent  a  right  or  claim  of  any  kind  or  nature  including  the  right  of  the  holder  of  such  shares  to 
receive Harvest Units.  In such case, such Harvest Units shall be returned to Harvest thereof for cancellation and any 
distributions in respect of Harvest Units shall be returned to Harvest.
5.6  No  certificates  representing  fractional  Harvest  Units  shall  be  issued  under  the  Arrangement.    In  lieu  of  any 
fractional  trust  unit  or  share,  each  registered  holder  of  Harvest  Exchangeable  Shares  and  Viking  Units  otherwise 
entitled  to  a  fractional  interest  in  a  Harvest  Unit,  shall  receive  the  nearest  whole  number  of  Harvest  Units  (with 
fractions equal to exactly 0.5 being rounded up).
