</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and 
consequences, submits the present report to the Human Rights Council pursuant to its 
resolution 6/14.  
</p>
<p> In this report, the Special Rapporteur explores the issue of forced labour in more detail. As 
mentioned in her initial report, the Special Rapporteur has also focused on bonded labour as a 
pre-eminent example of forced labour.  
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur believes that bonded labour as a form of slavery is a global issue. 
Neither its traditional form nor its subtle and new emerging forms have been sufficiently 
addressed. This is irrespective of the fact that many countries have ratified the slavery 
conventions and the relevant conventions of the International Labour Organization. The Special 
Rapporteur also found that where laws on forced labour exist, their enforcement is limited. In 
addition, the Special Rapporteur has found very few policies and programmes that address 
bonded labour. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur believes that comprehensive action to eliminate this phenomenon 
requires strong political will and the coordinated actions of many Governments to enforce 
international law and protect the rights of all.  
</p>
<p> In her conclusions, the Special Rapporteur also recommends that Governments, 
non-governmental organizations, United Nations agencies and private actors take specific 
prevention, prosecution and protection measures to combat forced and bonded labour. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur also had extensive consultations with regard to her mandate. She 
held bilateral and multilateral discussions, including with Member States, engaged with agencies 
of the United Nations system and consulted widely with civil society and directly with 
communities. She also attended expert seminars and conferences. These consultations proved 
invaluable in helping to inform all aspects of the mandate. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 6/14, in which the 
Council requested the Special Rapporteur to submit annual reports on the activities of the 
mandate to the Council. As stated in her initial report (A/HRC/9/20), the Special Rapporteur will 
focus on forced labour, paying particular attention to bonded labour. 
</p>
<p>2. In order to help her study global perspectives and gather information on national 
legislation and initiatives addressing the issue of bonded labour, the Special Rapporteur sent a 
questionnaire to permanent missions in Geneva. The questionnaire was answered by 
30 countries.<b>1</b> In addition, a questionnaire on bonded labour was sent to non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) that work with victims of forced and bonded labour. The Special 
Rapporteur received responses from four NGOs.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p><b>II.  ACTIVITIES OF THE MANDATE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Meetings with Governments, intergovernmental organizations  
and non-governmental organizations 
</b></p>
<p>3. Throughout the year, the Special Rapporteur held consultations with Governments as well 
as United Nations agencies, NGOs and other stakeholders. These consultations assisted the 
Special Rapporteur to gather information; discuss thematic priority areas and possibilities for 
support and collaboration.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Regional consultations 
</b></p>
<p>4. On 24 and 25 October 2008, the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur 
on the human rights of migrants participated in a joint regional consultation on migrant domestic 
workers in the Asia-Pacific region in Manila. This consultation was organized by the Asia 
Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development (APWLD),<b>3</b> the Coordination of Action 
Research on AIDS and Mobility (CARAM)<b>4</b> and the Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women 
(GAATW).<b>5</b> These organizations are leading networks in the Asia-Pacific Region that advocate

<p>and campaign for the protection and promotion of the rights of migrant workers, in particular 
women migrant workers, both documented and undocumented. The presentation made by the 
Special Rapporteur was entitled &#8220;Women migrants in the informal economy and domestic 
work&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Conferences 
</b></p>
<p>5. On 14 September 2008, the Special Rapporteur was invited to the Kennedy School of 
Government at Harvard University to give a talk on contemporary forms of slavery. Her 
presentation covered issues related to forced labour and trafficking in humans. 
</p>
<p>6. On 22 and 23 September 2008 the Special Rapporteur attended the Follow-up Technical 
Seminar to the Sixth Alliance Against Trafficking in Persons Conference on National 
Rapporteurs and Equivalent Mechanisms convened in Vienna by the Organization for Security 
and Cooperation in Europe. She was the keynote speaker. The Special Rapporteur spoke about 
the slavery mandate and the role that national rapporteurs can play at the national level in 
monitoring actions taken by States with regard to human rights. 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur also attended the International Trade Union Conference on 
Combating Forced Labour and Trafficking held in Athens from 21 to 23 November 2008. The 
presentation made by the Special Rapporteur was entitled &#8220;Global perspectives of forced 
labour&#8221;. She addressed the issues of domestic workers, child labour and forced labour in the 
informal economy.  
</p>
<p>8. From 25 to 28 November 2008, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special 
Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and the Special 
Rapporteur on the human rights aspects of trafficking in persons, especially women and children, 
attended the Third World Congress on the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children and 
Adolescents in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. She participated in a high-level panel on the subject 
&#8220;Initiatives of corporate social responsibility&#8221;. Her presentation covered the worst forms of child 
labour, hereditary forms of child slavery, domestic servitude and child labour used by 
corporations. The Special Rapporteur also presented best practices and methodologies to fight 
against child labour.  
</p>
<p>9. On 12 September 2008, the Special Rapporteur, together with five other special procedures 
mandate holders and a representative of civil society, was invited to speak on a panel discussing 
the integration of a gender perspective in the work of the Human Rights Council. The Special 
Rapporteur presented concrete methods for integrating gender in the work of special procedures, 
in her mandate and in the work of the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund on Contemporary 
Forms of Slavery.  
</p>
<p>10. On 2 and 3 December 2008, the Special Rapporteur participated in the Expert Seminar on 
the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, organized by 
the Council of Europe in cooperation with the Ministry of Gender Equality and the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs of Spain and held in Madrid. The Special Rapporteur delivered the keynote 
speech, describing her mandate, methods of work, and the areas to be covered during her 
three-year mandate. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>11. In December 2008, the Committee of the Parties to the Convention elected the Special 
Rapporteur to be a member of the Group of Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human 
Beings (GRETA), which will monitor compliance with the Convention. In February 2009, at its 
first meeting, the Special Rapporteur was elected Deputy Chair of GRETA. 
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur also participated in the Durban Review Conference in Geneva 
from 20 to 24 April 2009, where she participated in a high-level panel organized by the 
International Labour Organization (ILO) on the subject &#8220;Combating racism through decent 
work&#8221;. She highlighted the human rights of domestic workers. In addition, she also addressed the 
plenary and explained how slavery and discrimination had to be tackled jointly. 
</p>
<p><b>D. Collaboration with the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund  
on Contemporary Forms of Slavery 
</b></p>
<p>13. On 10 September 2008, the Special Rapporteur participated in a joint side event with the 
Board of Trustees of the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund on Contemporary Forms of 
Slavery during the ninth session of the Human Rights Council. In her presentation, she spoke 
about the thematic focus of her mandate: forced labour; child labour; and domestic work. She 
also talked about ways in which she would collaborate with the Fund, for example by 
establishing a method of collecting gender-disaggregated data, which has now been put in place. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Consultative coordination seminar 
</b></p>
<p>14. At the end of June 2009, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and the Special Rapporteur on the 
human rights aspects of the victims of trafficking in persons, especially women and children, 
organized a seminar with the aim of discussing the methods of work of the three mandates and 
developing practical modalities of collaboration between the three special rapporteurs, as well as 
between the special rapporteurs and United Nations agencies, NGOs and other United Nations 
human rights mechanisms. At the end of the seminar, the participants agreed on a plan of action 
specifying concrete tasks and a detailed planning schedule for the next several months. The tasks 
include the creation of a Listserv to regularly exchange information, as well as the creation of an 
online interface, which would include information about the three mandates, as well as 
information from NGOs, United Nations agencies and United Nations human rights mechanisms 
relevant to the three mandates. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>15. From 1 to 10 June 2009, the Special Rapporteur paid an official country mission to Haiti at 
the request of the Government to engage in a dialogue with the Government in order to identify 
the challenges in addressing the situation of &#8220;<i>restavek</i>&#8221; children. The Special Rapporteur held 
consultations with various NGOs, government officials, children and United Nations agencies. 
The report of her mission appears as addendum 1 to the present document. The Special 
Rapporteur expresses her thanks to the Government of Haiti for its cooperation and the 
assistance extended to her in the preparation and conduct of this visit. 
</p>
<p>16. In pursuance of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate to promote the effective application of 
relevant international norms and standards on slavery, she welcomes the invitations from Brazil, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Italy, Mauritania and Romania to carry out a country visit. She looks forward to a continuing 
dialogue with the following countries to which she has sent requests for visits: Bangladesh, 
Ecuador, Nepal, Peru, Qatar, the Sudan and Uzbekistan. 
</p>
<p><b>G.  Communications 
</b></p>
<p>17. On 21 January 2009, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
human rights aspects of the victims of trafficking in persons, especially women and children, and 
the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, its causes and consequences, sent a 
joint letter of allegation concerning two separate cases.  
</p><p>18. The first case concerns allegations that an Indian girl, aged 16, was kidnapped, abused and 
sold to a brothel to work as a prostitute. She escaped two years later and despite repeated 
complaints following her escape, no police investigation has been undertaken. It is reported that 
although she escaped from her abusers, she still lives in fear of reprisal, being kidnapped again 
or killed. It is alleged that the fact that she gave birth to a child suggests the prevalence of unsafe 
sexual practices in brothels, and that victims can easily fall prey to sexually transmitted 
infections like HIV.  
</p>
<p>19. According to information received, no action, investigation or arrests have been made by 
the police at Kotwali station despite the notoriety of the brothel owners and human traffickers 
involved in this case, and despite the fact that the Indian Penal Code includes a number of 
relevant prohibitions. 
</p>
<p>20. In the red-light district of Shivadspur (Varanasi), B., P., A., J. and T. are reportedly well 
known for kidnapping girls through fake marriage, intoxication, or simply through force. Girls 
are then sold to brothels where they are forced to work as prostitutes and for the production of 
pornographic material. 
</p>
<p>21. The second case concerns a 15-year-old Indian girl who was allegedly kidnapped and 
trafficked into sexual exploitation. While there has been a criminal investigation regarding her 
case, reportedly, this investigation has not been conducted adequately with a view to identifying 
and punishing all perpetrators involved. 
</p>
<p>22. The victim was reportedly taken to Varanasi and sold by human traffickers for sexual 
exploitation. According to the information received, on 30 August 2008, a search and rescue 
operation was carried out by local police. Allegedly, the girl was located in a brothel at 
3/120 Rattapur, Ramnagar, Varanasi. When the rescuers entered the house, they found five other 
girls also being held. The brothel keeper, Mr. P.N.M., and his &#8220;manager&#8221;, Mrs. A., were arrested 
during the rescue operation. 
</p>
<p>23. The girls found in the brothel had been made to dance with orchestras playing and were 
sexually exploited. Mrs. A. had told them that they were going to be sent to a foreign country 
within a few days.  
</p>
<p>24. The First Information Report was lodged at the Ramnagar Police Station, Varanasi, under 
the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act (ITP), 1956. Apparently, this case is registered against 
Mr. M., Mrs. A., as well as the five girls who were rescued from the house.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>25. An NGO has sent a letter to the investigating officer asking that the girls be treated as 
victims in accordance with the ITP Act, alleging that the police have named these five girls along 
with the accused criminals with the intention of undermining the prosecution of the actual 
culprits in the case. This is allegedly due to the fact that prostitution in Varanasi is a business 
carried out with the blessings of the local police. The police are also said not to have been 
serious enough in the investigation. Reportedly, on 3 September 2008, the magistrate rejected the 
bail application filed by Mr. M. and Mrs. A., who are awaiting trial. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she has not received a reply from the Government of 
India to her letter of 21 January 2009, and invites the Government to provide her with 
information regarding the allegations set out in her letter. 
</p>
<p><b>H.  Public statements 
</b></p>
<p>27. In addition, the Special Rapporteur made various public statements during the year, 
separately and in cooperation with other mandate holders. For example on 2 December 2009, for 
the International Day for the Abolition of Slavery, she issued a press release stating that despite 
significant progress in the fight against slavery, there was still a need to acknowledge the 
existence of traditional forms of slavery, increase our understanding of slavery in its modern 
forms, and develop innovative strategies to tackle slavery. On 21 March 2009, on the occasion of 
the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the Special Rapporteur made 
a statement highlighting the link between discrimination and slavery, at a high-level panel 
organized by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  THE PRACTICE OF BONDED LABOUR 
</b></p>
<p>28. Although forced labour is a global problem affecting almost every country, today, forced 
and specifically bonded labour is not perceived as slavery or a slavery-like practice, and yet it is 
the most widely used method of enslaving people. Despite the fact that it is not well known, 
bonded labour is one of the most traditional and widespread forms of forced labour.  
</p>
<p>29 In order to understand the nature of bonded labour, it is important to look at the broader 
issue of forced labour before addressing the specificity of bonded labour. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Forced labour 
</b></p>
<p>30 While slavery and slavery-like practices are complex phenomena and not always easy to 
define, a component of forced labour is almost always present.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  Anti-Slavery International,<i> Poverty, Development and the Elimination of Slavery, </i>discussion 
</p>
<p>paper by Mike Kaye and Aidan Mcquade, October 2007. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>31. Forced labour is defined as &#8220;all work or service which is exacted from any person under 
the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily&#8221;.<b>7</b> In 
defining forced labour, the nature of the relationship between the employer and the person forced 
to work is important. Two basic elements have to be considered: firstly, that the work or service 
extracted was done under threat or penalty and, secondly, that the work was done involuntarily.  
</p>
<p>32. Forced labour is often hidden, making it difficult to trace the perpetrators as well as the 
victims. Many victims of forced labour are ashamed and afraid to speak out; this makes it 
difficult to prevent and eradicate forced labour.  
</p>
<p>33. The causes of forced labour are many and varied. They can occur as a result of all or one of 
the following: poverty; demand for cheap labour; unemployment; a global or national economic 
crisis. The most striking factor, however, is the increasing human insecurity today and 
insufficient progress with regard to human rights protection. 
</p>
<p>34. Traditionally, forced labour takes the form of bonded labour and serfdom.  
</p>
<p>35. Time and realities may have changed but the core essence of slavery persists in modern 
economies. In its modern forms, we find forced labour in agriculture, domestic servitude, the 
garment industry, the construction industry and prostitution and in the supply chains of 
mainstream companies.<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>36. Forced labour occurs in the formal and informal sectors. Generally, the people working in 
the informal sector are more vulnerable to forced labour. In some areas, bonded labour patterns 
reflect traditional feudal relationships. However, newer dynamics of forced and bonded labour 
relationships are emerging, for example, in agriculture, where traditional relationships between 
the agricultural worker and the landlord are replaced by seasonal migration. In addition, 
previously formal sectors, such as the construction industry, also tend to become increasingly 
informal with the use of contractors and intermediaries to hire workers, often for short periods. 
Such situations reinforce the risk of trafficking and bonded labour.  
</p>
<p>37. Recent data presented by ILO show that the estimated minimum number of persons 
involved in the world of illicit forced labour is 12.3 million.<b>9</b> This means that millions of people 
in modern society are excluded from directly contributing to the development of their 
communities and the wealth of their families. They are ultimately unable to exercise their rights 
in their communities and their countries. 
</p>
<p>38. ILO also states that, regarding global minimum estimates of forced labour in its main 
forms, 64 per cent of forced labour is for economic exploitation by private economic agents, 
20 per cent is imposed by the State or military, 11 per cent is forced labour for commercial

 <p> 
</p>
<p>sexual exploitation and 5 per cent is mixed undetermined forms of forced labour. Analysis 
conducted by ILO on trends in forced labour demonstrates two important themes: that forced 
labour is present in all regions of the world, and that most contemporary forms of forced labour 
are extracted by private agents.<b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>39. In the next section, the Special Rapporteur will describe the reality of bonded labour before 
looking at its links with trafficking. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Bonded labour 
</b></p>
<p><b>Definition 
</b></p>
<p>40. Debt bondage, or bonded labour, is defined in article 1 (a) of the Supplementary 
Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar 
to Slavery as &#8220;the status or condition arising from a pledge by a debtor of his personal services or 
those of a person under his control as security for a debt, if the value of those services as 
reasonably assessed is not applied towards the liquidation of the debt or the length and nature of 
those services are not respectively limited and defined&#8221;. Bonded labour is within the category of 
practices likely to result in a &#8220;servile status&#8221; and under the Supplementary Convention 
Governments are obliged to pass laws to abolish it. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>41. Bonded labour occurs when a person offers his/her labour services in exchange for the 
repayment of a debt. However, in order for this sort of arrangement to be considered bonded 
labour, some supplementary conditions must apply. The person has to lose control over his/her 
work conditions, the length of the arrangement, and the equivalent in terms of labour of the 
amount of money owed.<b>11</b> Unlike in cases of a regular loan, safeguards such as reasonable 
conditions of repayment or agreed interest rates do not exist. Research has demonstrated that the 
employer uses the debt to coerce individuals into working in exploitative conditions with long 
working hours, low wages, no days off, etc.<b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>42. There are two distinct forms of bonded labour: firstly, when the debtor, his life and his 
family&#8217;s lives become &#8220;collateral&#8221; for the debt; and secondly, when the work of the debtor is 
allegedly applied to the debt repayment. The first form, where the very nature of the agreement 
transforms labour into collateral, in reality rejects any condition under which the trapped person 
can repay the debt. The second form is a violation of the debt agreement, as the value of the 
services as reasonably assessed is not in fact applied towards the liquidation of the debt, 
entrapping the debtor.<b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>43. In many situations the agreement between the worker and the employer is made orally and 
no safeguards exist for a person to protect him/herself from long-term or perpetual enslavement. 
Evidence shows that entire families have been forced to repay a debt or obtain a loan. Based on 
information collected from NGOs, although children&#8217;s work remains unrecognized and 
unremunerated, children carry the burden of debt along with their parents and are made to work 
to help repay the debt. Crucially, children will inherit their parents&#8217; debts in the event of their 
parents&#8217; deaths. This process perpetuates the cycle from generation to generation, thus extending 
slavery and establishing new slavery precedents in modern reality. 
</p>
<p>44. Data also show that emerging and widespread manifestations of bonded labour occur when 
in order to obtain the money for exceptional family circumstances such as health problems or 
education for children, entire families are forced to work to repay a debt.<b>14</b>  
</p>
<p><b>Causes 
</b></p>
<p>45. Poverty plays a crucial role in explaining bonded labour. Bonded labourers, both urban and 
rural, are chronically poor. The vast majority are initially trapped in bonded labour because they 
have no other way of subsisting apart from taking a loan from a landlord or an employer. Many 
take such loans because they do not have enough money to meet their basic daily needs or to pay 
for a specific event like a wedding or a funeral.  
</p>
<p>46. In many instances, NGOs claim that isolation, lack of guidance, lack of contact with 
institutions and authorities that could assist the communities, as well as a lack of basic services 
have created a situation of extreme vulnerability which has facilitated exploitation and forced 
labour. 
</p>
<p>47. The low level of education of the concerned populations also puts them in a vulnerable 
situation as they are not able to understand the nature of their debts or control them in any way. 
The lack of education also leads to a lack of knowledge and understanding of their rights as 
workers and, in some cases, as indigenous people. They are not able to negotiate any kind of 
workers&#8217; rights such as minimum wages, maximum daily work hours, holidays, frequency of pay 
and methods of payment. 
</p>
<p>48. Bonded labourers are mostly from socially excluded groups, including indigenous people, 
minorities and migrants, who suffer additionally from discrimination and political 
disenfranchisement. 
</p>
<p>49. The indigenous and minority populations are more vulnerable to bonded labour because in 
many countries, they have limited access to land for their traditional income-generating activities 
such as cultivation or hunting.<b>15</b> The issue of land ownership is closely linked with the 
phenomenon of bonded labour.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>50. According to information gathered from NGOs, bonded labour of indigenous people is 
mainly due to a combination of poverty and discrimination. In many countries, institutional and 
social discrimination limits their opportunities to find fairly remunerated jobs, pushing the entire 
family to work in exploitative conditions. This discrimination has left tens of thousands of 
indigenous people without access to jobs, land, education or health care and extremely 
vulnerable to bonded labour. In some cases, workers are aware of the exploitative situations they 
may be getting into but, due to their extreme poverty and desperation for work, they are willing 
to take the risk. 
</p>
<p>51. ILO research shows a clear link in Asian countries between forced labour and 
long-standing patterns of discrimination. In India, the overwhelming majority of bonded labour 
victims in agriculture, brick making, mining and other sectors are from Scheduled Castes and 
Scheduled Tribes.<b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>52. According to information received, modernized methods of agriculture have also increased 
vulnerability to bonded labour. Firstly, because of the increased reliance on machines, demand 
for labourers has declined overall and become more seasonal. Therefore, many workers take 
advances against their salaries and must work the full season to receive the rest of the 
remuneration, should any be deemed to be owed them. Wages may be particularly low and the 
conditions of repayment of the debt or advance exploitative. Secondly, the development of 
transport infrastructure has enabled landlords to recruit workers from outside their villages, and 
provided more labourers with the means to migrate. Migrant labourers can often face heightened 
vulnerability to bondage and exploitation due to unfamiliar surroundings, their status as 
migrants, lack of social networks, language barriers, close surveillance and other forms of 
control by employers. 
</p>
<p>53. Bonded labour can also be linked to sexual exploitation. According to information 
gathered from NGOs, in some countries multiple wives are bonded into prostitution, a practice 
that is embedded within the system of polygamy and bride procurement. Men take a number of 
loans to procure several wives. Women may then be sent to work in brothels, or alternatively 
&#8220;loaned&#8221; to brothel owners, where their earnings are shared between the brothel owner and the 
husband. The bonded woman is not allowed to leave the brothel until the debt of her husband has 
been cleared. Men who are unable to pay their debts to landowners are also reported to have 
bonded their wives into prostitution. 
</p>
<p>54. Research shows that legislation prohibiting bonded labour and factors such as the impacts 
of globalization are leading to modified or new forms of bonded labour. For example, they have

</p>
<p>led to the aggravation of the bondage of women and children. Historically, a work contract 
established between an employer and a head of household required all members of the labourer&#8217;s 
family to work for the employer; individual family members did not need to establish separate 
contracts. Now, however, women and girls are increasingly bonded in their own right. They are 
often bonded in domestic work, fish processing, silk farming, bangle production, carpet making 
and weaving industries.  
</p>
<p><b>Occurrences of bonded labour 
</b></p>
<p>55. Based on responses to questionnaires, the Special Rapporteur has determined that bonded 
labour is mainly used by private individuals rather than the State. Bonded labour can take place 
in the area of residence of the indebted person or in another city or country.  
</p>
<p>56. According to information received, bonded labourers are predominant in logging 
companies and on private ranches. In the former, some company bosses are able to exploit the 
labour of indigenous communities to extract valuable timber, without actually controlling the 
land. Middlemen approach indigenous communities and offer them advances in the form of basic 
goods, public goods (such as building a school or playing field), or money. These advances form 
part of a verbal or written contract whereby the community agrees to provide the middleman 
with an amount of timber of a specified quality, although usually the contract does not specify 
the price of the timber.<b>17</b> The communities are then charged excessively high prices for the goods 
provided while the timber is undervalued.  
</p>
<p>57. On private ranches, the debt arises from a number of different factors. Indigenous workers 
often receive far below the minimum wage. In addition, in many instances it can take many 
months before they receive payment for their work. During this time, workers will buy food and 
other essential provisions at the estate shop where prices may be inflated. This means that most, 
if not all, of their salary may be used to pay off their outstanding debts at the estate shop and 
some will have an ongoing debt from one payday to the next. Debt can also be transferred from 
generation to generation, with sons inheriting their fathers&#8217; debts. In many cases, when the father 
dies, the rest of the family remains tied to the ranch by the debt. 
</p>
<p>58. ILO research shows that the manipulation of credit and debt, either by employers or by 
recruiting agents, is still a key factor that traps vulnerable workers in forced labour situations. 
Poor peasants and indigenous peoples in Asia and Latin America may be induced into 
indebtedness, through accepting relatively small but cumulative loans or wage advances from 
employers or recruiters at a time of scarcity. Alternatively, aspirant migrants may have to pay 
very large amounts to the agents who help them. The 2007 ILO General Survey included in its

<p>forced labour typology unlawful practices of debt bondage, under which labourers and their 
families are forced to work for an employer in order to pay off their actually incurred or inherited 
debts, noting that these practices still affect a significant number of people.<b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>59. In Asia, the <i>kamaiya </i>and <i>haliya </i>systems are examples of bonded labour in the agriculture 
sector. Under the <i>kamaiya</i> system of bonded agricultural labour a <i>kamaiya</i> (worker) is bonded to 
a sole landlord over a long period of time by an advance which usually ranges from the 
equivalent of US$ 1 to $10. The <i>haliya</i> system is a similar system but with a short-term contract. 
The labourer will receive food and a piece of land for his own cultivation. If a <i>kamaiya </i>or<i> haliya</i> 
fails to turn up for a day&#8217;s work, even in the event of serious illness, he loses two days&#8217; wages or 
has to send a substitute.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>60. On the basis of the information received through the questionnaire sent to Member States, 
the Special Rapporteur is of the view that in most countries bonded labour falls into the category 
of trafficking in persons and that it is indeed difficult to secure exact data specifically on forced 
labour or bonded labour. In these instances, domestic servitude, sexual slavery and industrial 
labour, particularly in the construction sector, have been identified as the most common forms of 
bonded labour.  
</p>
<p>61. Based on these findings, and keeping in mind that the Special Rapporteur has been 
requested by the Council in its resolution 6/14 to &#8220;focus on aspects of contemporary forms of 
slavery which are not covered by existing mandates of the Human Rights Council&#8221;, the Special 
Rapporteur will, in the next part of this report, look at the link between forced labour, bonded 
labour and trafficking.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Forced labour, bonded labour and trafficking 
</b></p>
<p>62. Trafficking in persons is the acquisition of people by improper means such as force, fraud 
or deception, with the aim of exploiting them.<b>20</b> 
</p>
<p>63. There are many ways in which a person can be coerced into undertaking work against 
his/her free will. The victims are lured, given false promises and transported to their new 
workplace by the trafficker and must, on arrival, repay the travel and organizational costs 
incurred. This is used as a tool, for example, to push women into prostitution. 
</p>
<p>64. Forced labour is closely linked to human trafficking, but is not identical to it. The ILO 
estimates of forced labour include people who are coerced to work both across borders and in

 <p> 
</p>
<p>their place of origin. A distinction must also be drawn between those people who are under some 
form of economic compulsion to accept substandard working conditions because they simply 
have no alternative (exploitation or abuse of vulnerability, but not necessarily forced labour) and 
those against whom actual coercion is exercised by a third party to force them to undertake a job 
against their will.<b>21</b>  
</p>
<p>65. Bonded labour is among the most prevalent means now being used to keep trafficked 
victims in situations of forced labour.<b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>66. The advance payment, both in the cases of trafficking in humans and bonded labour, 
becomes the tool of enslavement and puts the trafficker and creditor in a dominant position. This 
increases the risk of and opportunity for abuse. Allowing the creditor to adjust interest rates or 
simply to add interest without informing the &#8220;employee&#8221; increases the debt owed. In the case of 
bonded labour these conditions mean that the debtor is unable to repay the loan and remains 
bonded for an indefinite period. In both trafficking and bonded labour, people are forced to work 
to repay their debts. Although trafficking and bonded labour have different starting points and 
different mechanisms of enslavement, they are both forms of slavery. 
</p>
<p>67. Unlike someone in bonded labour, a person trafficked has a greater chance of eventually 
being free. This is because almost every country has introduced trafficking programmes and 
criminal sanctions on trafficking in national legislation. Internationally, more countries are aware 
of trafficking and are keen to enforce international and national laws.  
</p>
<p>68. Technically, bonded labourers can end their state of servitude once the debt is repaid. But 
the fact is that this rarely occurs. Since debtors are often illiterate and lack basic math skills, they 
are easy prey for moneylenders. A combination of low wages and usurious interest rates make it 
impossible to repay the initial debt. In many cases the debt increases because the employer 
deducts payments for equipment and tools or charges fines for faulty work. Sometimes the 
labour pledged is used to repay the interest on the loan but not the principal. 
</p>
<p>69. Consequently, a person in bonded labour is bonded potentially throughout his or her life. In 
many cases the obligation to repay the loan is inherited by the victim&#8217;s children, who are born 
into a life of bonded labour.  
</p>
<p><b>D.  The gender component of forced labour and bonded labour 
</b></p>
<p>70. Statistics show that in forced labour for economic exploitation, while women and girls 
represent the majority (56 per cent) of victims, men and boys nevertheless account for 
44 per cent. Different age and gender groups can be found in different sectors, e.g. men are often 
found in construction work, women in domestic work and children in the carpet industry.<b>23</b>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>71. According to ILO, direct bondage of women appears to be on the increase in commercial 
large-scale agriculture production.<b>24</b> In addition, a high incidence of bonded labour is found in 
brick making, domestic service, carpet weaving and mining. Women provide the majority of the 
labour force in these industries, except for mining.<b>25</b> 
</p>
<p>72. In some societies, women and children can traditionally be bonded through a male head of 
household to work to pay off debts he has contracted. The debts are often incurred for social 
ceremonies, e.g. weddings and funerals, as well as for maternal and child health care. Increases 
in domestic violence and rising alcoholism, mostly among men, have been linked to problems 
repaying debts. The entire family usually works off the debt as agricultural labourers. In 
addition, the women and children are also expected to do domestic work. Women and girls 
engaged in domestic work are often exposed to sexual violence. 
</p>
<p>73. Women also form the majority of domestic migrant workers who find themselves in 
situations of forced labour with restrictions on their freedom of movement, often working long 
hours and having their identity documents taken away from them by their employers. 
</p>
<p>74. In situations where women are directly bonded, they are often charged higher interest rates, 
making it more difficult for them to repay the debts. Their wages are also generally lower than 
those of men.  
</p>
<p>75. Gender inequalities and discrimination play an important role in contributing to women&#8217;s 
vulnerability to bonded labour. The combined effects of low education levels, workplace 
discrimination, exclusion from family decision-making processes and lack of familial property 
rights increase women&#8217;s vulnerability to labour exploitation and dependency and thus make them 
susceptible to bondage.  
</p>
<p><b>IV.  LEGAL AND POLICY FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  International instruments 
</b></p>
<p>76. Slavery is prohibited in international human rights law. Article 4 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights states that &#8220;no one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery 
and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms&#8221;. In addition, article 23 states that 
everyone has the right to just and favourable conditions of work and remuneration, and to equal 
pay without discrimination, and article 24 stipulates that everyone has the right to reasonable 
working hours.

and Cultural Rights also protects the right to just and favourable conditions of work, in its 
articles 6 and 7.<b>27</b>

hard labour may be imposed as a punishment for a crime, the performance of hard labour 
in pursuance of a sentence to such punishment by a competent court;

<p>&#8220;(c) For the purpose of this paragraph the term &#8216;forced or compulsory labour&#8217; shall not 
include: (i) Any work or service, not referred to in subparagraph (<i>b</i>), normally required of 
a person who is under detention in consequence of a lawful order of a court, or of a person 
during conditional release from such detention; (ii) Any service of a military character and, 
in countries where conscientious objection is recognized, any national service required by 
law of conscientious objectors; (iii) Any service exacted in cases of emergency or calamity 
threatening the life or well-being of the community; (iv) Any work or service which forms 
part of normal civil obligations.&#8221;

<p><b>27
</b>  Article 6 states: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;1. The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the right to work, which 
includes the right of everyone to the opportunity to gain his living by work which he freely 
chooses or accepts, and will take appropriate steps to safeguard this right.  
</p>
<p>&#8220;2. The steps to be taken by a State Party to the present Covenant to achieve the full 
realization of this right shall include technical and vocational guidance and training 
programmes, policies and techniques to achieve steady economic, social and cultural 
development and full and productive employment under conditions safeguarding 
fundamental political and economic freedoms to the individual.&#8221;

<p>78. The Convention on the Rights of the Child and its two optional protocols and the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members 
of Their Families also contain provisions addressing forced labour and other forms of 
exploitation. 
</p>
<p>79. The Slavery Convention of 1926 and the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of 
Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery of 1956 specifically 
prohibit the practice of forced or compulsory labour and bonded labour as forms of slavery. 
</p>
<p>80. The ILO Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29), the Abolition of Forced Labour 
Convention, 1957 (No. 105) and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182) 
address the issue of forced labour. Convention No. 29 establishes that forced labour exacted by 
the State shall be penalized and that it is the obligation of any ratifying State to ensure the 
enforcement of the Convention and the application of adequate sanctions. Convention No. 105 
abolishes all forms of forced labour. Convention No. 182 states that child labour amounts to 
forced labour when exacted by a third party or family. 
</p>
<p>81. There are other instruments dealing with forced labour and bonded labour in the more 
specific context of trafficking, such as the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in 
Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others of 1949 and the Protocol to Prevent, 
Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the 
United Nations Convention on Transnational Organized Crime of 2000.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  National instruments 
</b></p>
<p>83. Based on the questionnaire responses, many countries have adopted national legislative 
measures to prohibit labour exploitation and forced labour. National legislation is targeted at 
forced labour and not specifically bonded labour. However, the approaches in doing so have 
been different. Based on the replies received from Member States to the questionnaire, the 
Special Rapporteur has made the following observations.  
</p>
<p>84. Many countries, in defining forced labour, used labour coercion as a determining factor 
and did not include labour conditions. Exploitation as such is not clearly defined in international 
law and different approaches can be taken to defining it. Exploitation can be understood as a 
series of labour conditions that alone or together can be considered &#8220;exploitative&#8221;. These 
conditions can affect the number of hours worked during a day, the wages, the duration of the 
contract, etc. Under this definition, the concept of exploitation can vary from one context to 
another and depend strongly on economic and social factors. However, the responses to the 
questionnaire would indicate that most countries seem to have based their definition of 
exploitation not on the conditions of work, but on whether an element of coercion exists, 
coercion being understood as fear for the safety of oneself or the safety of others. Therefore, if 
there is no coercion, it can be implied that there is no labour exploitation, the working conditions 
notwithstanding.  
</p>
<p>85. In addition to adopting legislation, States have taken concrete policy measures to prevent 
forced labour, predominantly within the context of trafficking. Training courses are increasingly 
being provided to law enforcement officials and immigration officers in order that they may be 
able to identify circumstances of labour exploitation and forced labour. Some Governments have 
funded awareness-raising campaigns which target the general public and law enforcement 
agencies. Often programmes addressing these issues have been integrated into bigger policies on 
related areas such as violence against women and child labour rights. Some Governments have 
also decentralized the implementation of the policies by working with organizations such as 
labour recruitment agencies.  
</p>
<p>86. When it comes to implementation of the legislative framework, however, most States noted 
that it is hard to obtain exact data as often offences related to forced labour, trafficking or bonded 
labour are criminalized under the general penal or criminal code. Offences can therefore be 
prosecuted under various charges, which makes it harder to extract precise data.  
</p>
<p>87. With regard to policies aiming at the rehabilitation of victims, some States have created 
victims&#8217; services such as shelters and drop-in centres. It is worth noting that many of these 
services specifically address the needs of women and children. However, the services are not 
aimed specifically at victims of forced labour. 
</p>
<p>88. Finally, many States identified globalization and its impact on the liberalization of markets 
and the privatization of various sectors of the economy as key factors putting additional pressure 
on the labour markets and therefore hindering efforts to eradicate forced labour.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The questionnaire responses from Member States demonstrate that bonded labour 
has received limited attention in national legislation. This is because bonded labour is 
perceived to exist either in traditional, rural settings, or not at all. There is a lack of 
awareness and understanding of the new subtle, emerging forms of bonded labour.  
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>Despite the fact that forced labour mostly involves private agents, it is the 
responsibility of the State to enact legislation and policies to combat forced labour and 
protect the victims.  
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>It is not only important that a country has legislation to combat forced labour, but 
that the legislation is enforceable. Studies also show that where countries have introduced 
legislation to combat forced labour, the legislation has been difficult to enforce.29  
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>It is encouraging to note that countries like India, Pakistan and Brazil have been able 
to successfully enforce the existing laws against bonded labour. The Government of India 
has indicated that it gives priority to the identification, release and rehabilitation of bonded 
labourers. Figures from India for 2008 show 5,893 prosecutions and 1,289 convictions 
under the 1976 Bonded Labour System Abolition Act. In Pakistan, in accordance with 
1992 legislation, judicial action has been taken to release bonded labourers and in 2006 the 
Government of Brazil released 3,266 bonded labourers in Brazil.30  
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>In recent years much attention has been rightly paid to trafficking in human beings. 
Important United Nations and regional legal instruments have been developed, such as the 
United Nations Convention on Transnational Organized Crime and its Trafficking 
Protocol. The documents, signed by a large number of States, call for parties to use 
criminal sanctions to punish trafficking and to develop policies to prevent trafficking and 
protect trafficking victims. There are currently steps in place to develop monitoring 
mechanisms for the United Nations Convention. Regional trafficking instruments such as 
the South Asian Convention against Trafficking of the South Asian Association for 
Regional Cooperation and the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking 
have also been developed. States have also taken significant steps to combat trafficking 
which have resulted in many victims being released from this slavery-like practice. 
Trafficking in human beings is also addressed in other United Nations treaties such as the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child.

</b>  Ibid. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>94. <b>ILO estimates that about 20 per cent of all forced labour is an outcome of trafficking. 
According to the replies from Member States, on the other hand, instances of forced labour 
occur only as a result of trafficking. Forced labour which may occur in the informal sector, 
in supply chains and export processing zones, within indigenous or minority populations 
and in rural areas - the other 80 per cent - was not addressed. Statistics show that of those 
trafficked into forced labour, 43 per cent are trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation, 
32 per cent are trafficked for economic exploitation, and the remaining 25 per cent are 
trafficked for mixed or undetermined reasons.31 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Unlike the attention devoted to trafficking, the international efforts to sign, ratify, 
enforce and monitor the slavery conventions32 pale in comparison. This despite the fact 
that there are 27 million enslaved people worldwide.33 Given the gravity of the human 
rights violations associated with such forms of slavery as bonded labour and the millions of 
people affected by such practices in every part of the world, it is important that the forms 
of slavery defined in the 1926 Convention and the 1956 Supplementary Convention be 
given their due prominence and attention.

<p>96. <b>Forced labour and bonded labour constitute human rights violations that put a 
person in a condition of slavery, which is a crime under international law. Human rights 
need to be mainstreamed in development programmes set up to address the root causes of 
slavery. Such programmes include those on poverty reduction, employment empowerment 
programmes, microcredit, and agricultural programmes including land privatization and 
cultivation. Immigration and foreign employment programmes should also put human 
rights at the centre of their work.  
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Throughout the years, ILO has done tremendous work to eliminate forced labour, 
though programmes and actions addressing bonded labour as a separate crime and form of 
slavery are still insufficient. Complementing the actions that have been undertaken by ILO 
by bringing in a strong human rights perspective will make the impact holistic and strong.  
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>In the area of prevention of bonded labour, the Special Rapporteur recommends the 
following:  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Nationwide awareness campaigns should be developed on causes and consequence 
of bonded labour. 
</b></p>
<p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Protection and promotion of the rights of victims of bonded labour should be part 
of the educational programmes on forced labour. These training programmes 
should be delivered to State and non-State actors. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Research needs to be developed on bonded labour with regard to its links to land 
reform, the impact of privatization programmes, access to microcredit, labour 
migration policies, and immigration and foreign labour recruitment policies. This 
research should contain gender- and age-specific data. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>All the development programmes should be carefully audited from the perspective 
of human rights protection and inclusion. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Policies and practices should be developed to ensure the effective access of 
vulnerable people to their rights to education, health, food, land and secure 
employment. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Businesses should include human rights principles, including provisions on the 
prevention of and protection against forced labour, in all contracts with joint 
venture partners, suppliers and subcontractors. Businesses should apply human 
rights through their entire business supply chains. 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>With regard to the prosecution of violators and the protection of the rights of victims 
of forced labour (including bonded labour), the Special Rapporteur recommends the 
following: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Specific legislation with regard to bonded labour also needs to be developed. This 
needs to be done alongside the establishment of compensation schemes and 
reintegration programmes for those who suffered from this crime. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>National legislation should view forced labour in a global context incorporating 
criminalization of different forms of forced labour not limited to trafficking in 
human beings and specifically including bonded labour and other slavery-like 
practices. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Existing legislation on forced labour should be enforced and bonded labour should 
be criminalized; compensation schemes should be sought for those who suffered 
from that crime. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Stronger guidelines and policing of labour agents, e.g. domestic labour agencies 
and construction labour contractors, and of marriage brokers and small industries 
in remote areas, should be developed. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Monitoring mechanisms should be developed for employment agencies and their 
supply chains to detect and combat bonded labour. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Cooperation should be established between the labour inspection services, law 
enforcement agencies, other State agencies and NGOs that have professional 
competence in the area. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Programmes should be developed by States to protect and restore the rights and 
dignity of persons who are victims of forced and bonded labour. These 
programmes should include well-thought-out rescue and rehabilitation 
programmes, establishment of shelters for victims, and complex programmes for 
long-term sustainable rehabilitation and restoration of dignity. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Cooperation among States, specifically on the situation of migrant domestic 
workers, is important. Bilateral and multilateral agreements between States, 
labour agencies and/or trade unions should be developed. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Outreach and direct support programmes should be developed to address specific 
situations of risk. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>International agencies and NGOs working to maximize the impact of development 
or technical assistance programmes in the field and address the issues of forced 
and bonded labourers should enhance cooperation and coordination.
