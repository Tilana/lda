Dear Securityholder:
OREX MINERALS INC.
You  are  invited  to  attend  an  annual  and  special  meeting  (the  "Meeting")  of  the  holders  (the "Orex 
Shareholders")  of  common  shares  (each,  an  "Orex  Share"),  holders  (the  "Orex  Optionholders")  of 
options (each, an "Orex Option") to purchase Orex Shares and holders (the "Orex Warrantholders" 
and  together  with  the  Orex  Shareholders  and  Orex  Optionholders,  the  "Orex  Securityholders")  of 
warrants (each, an "Orex Warrant") to purchase Orex Shares of Orex Minerals Inc. ("Orex") to be held 
at Suite 1700, Park Place, 666 Burrard Street, Vancouver, BC, Canada V6C 2X8 on September 23, 2015 
at 10:00 a.m. (Vancouver time).
At the Meeting, in addition to the business of the annual meeting, you will be asked to consider and 
vote  upon  a  proposed  plan  of  arrangement  (the  "Arrangement")  involving  Orex,  Barsele  Minerals 
Corp. ("Spinco"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orex, and Orex Securityholders. The Arrangement is 
primarily  being  conducted  in  order  for  Orex  to  spin  out  its  45%  interest  in  Gunnarn  Mining  AB 
("Gunnarn"), the corporate entity which owns 100% of the Barsele Gold Project ("Barsele Project") in 
Sweden  to  Spinco,  which  will  be  a  separate  publicly-listed  company  following  completion  of  the 
Arrangement. The separation of Orex's assets will enable management to advance Orex's projects in a 
more focused and efficient manner.
Under the Arrangement, Orex Securityholders will be entitled to receive:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
for each Orex Share held, one new common share of Orex (a "New Common Share") and one 
common share of Spinco (a "Spinco Share");
for each unexercised Orex Option held, one fully-vested option to purchase from Orex one 
New Common Share and one fully-vested option to purchase from Spinco one Spinco Share, 
each  with  adjusted  exercise  prices  to  reflect  the  respective  valuations  of  Orex  and  Spinco 
immediately after the Arrangement; and
for  each  unexercised  Orex  Warrant  held,  one  warrant  to  purchase  from  Orex  one  New 
Common Share and one warrant to purchase from Spinco one Spinco Share, each with  the 
same exercise price as the Orex Warrant for which such warrants are exchanged.
As a result of the Arrangement, Spinco will hold Orex's 45% interest in the Barsele Project, which is 
subject to a joint venture with Agnico Eagle Mines Limited, and Orex will retain the other mineral 
assets  currently  held  by  Orex,  including  the  Los Crestones  Project  and  Coneto  Property  in  Mexico 
and  the  Jumping  Josephine  Project  in  British  Columbia,  Canada.  Upon  completion  of  the 
Arrangement,  each  Orex  Shareholder  will  retain  its  respective  interest  in  Orex  and  hold  a 
proportional  interest  in  Spinco  and  each  Orex  Optionholder  and  Orex  Warrantholder  will  retain  a 
right to purchase a proportional interest in each of Orex and Spinco.
Orex Shareholders will also be asked to consider and vote upon an amended and restated Orex stock 
option plan and a Spinco stock option plan.
In  order  to  become  effective,  the  Arrangement  must  be  approved  by  a  resolution  passed  by:  (i)  at 
least two-thirds of the votes cast by Orex Shareholders and Orex Optionholders present in person or 
represented by proxy at the Meeting, voting together as a single class, on the basis of one vote per 
Orex  Share  and  with  each  Orex  Optionholder  being  entitled  to  that  number  of  votes  equal  to  the
number  of  Orex  Shares  that  such  holder  would  be  entitled  to  receive  upon  exercise  of  the  Orex 
Options held by such holder as of the record date of the Meeting; and (ii) at least two-thirds of the 
votes cast by Orex Warrantholders present in person or represented by proxy at the Meeting, voting 
as a single class, with each Orex Warrantholder being entitled to that number of votes equal to the 
number  of  Orex  Shares  that  such  holder  would  be  entitled  to  receive  upon  exercise  of  the  Orex 
Warrants held by such holder as of the record date of the Meeting. In addition to the approvals of the 
Orex  Securityholders,  completion  of  the  Arrangement  is  subject  to  receipt  of  required  regulatory 
approvals,  including  the  approval  of  the  TSX  Venture  Exchange  and  the  Supreme  Court  of  British 
Columbia (the "Court"), and other customary closing conditions, all of which are described in more 
detail in the accompanying management information circular (the "Circular").
The Orex board of directors (the "Orex Board") has unanimously concluded that the Arrangement is 
in  the  best  interests  of  Orex  and  is  fair  to  the  Orex  Securityholders  and  has  approved  the 
Arrangement  and  authorized  its  submission  to  the  Orex  Securityholders  and  to  the  Court  for 
approval.  Accordingly, the Orex Board unanimously recommends that the Orex Securityholders 
vote FOR the Arrangement.
The accompanying notice of meeting and Circular contain a detailed description of the Arrangement 
and include certain other information to assist you in considering the matters to be voted upon. You 
are  urged  to  carefully  consider  all  of  the  information  in  the  accompanying  Circular,  including  the 
documents  incorporated  by  reference.  If  you  require  assistance,  you  should  consult  your  financial, 
legal, or other professional advisor.
Your vote is important regardless of the number of Orex Shares, Orex Options or Orex Warrants you 
own.

from Orex and Spinco, respectively.
* * * * *
While certain matters, such as the timing of the receipt of Court approval and receipt of all applicable 
approvals are beyond the control of Orex, if the resolution approving the Arrangement is passed by 
the requisite majorities of Orex Securityholders at the Meeting, and the other conditions to closing are 
satisfied, it is anticipated that the Arrangement will be completed and become effective on or about 
September 25, 2015.

THIS CIRCULAR.  ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.
CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This  Circular,  the  pro  forma  financial  statements  of  Orex  and  Spinco  and  certain  of  the  documents 
incorporated  by  reference  into  this  Circular  contain  "forward-looking  information"  within  the 
meaning of Canadian securities legislation and "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of 
applicable securities  legislation,  including the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 
1995 (collectively, "forward-looking statements"). These forward-looking statements are made as of 
the  date  of  this  Circular  or  as  of  the  date  of  the  applicable  document  from  which  they  are 
incorporated by reference.
Forward-looking statements relate to future events or future performance and reflect the expectations 
or  beliefs  of  management  of  Orex  and  Spinco  regarding  future  events,  and  include,  but  are  not 
limited to, statements with respect to the timing and implementation of the proposed Arrangement, 
the  anticipated  benefits  of  the Arrangement,  estimation  of  mineral  reserves  and  mineral  resources, 
availability  of  cash  flow  to  fund  capital  requirements,  the  timing  and  amount  of  estimated  future 
production,  availability  of  project  financing,  and  success  of  mining  and  development  operations. 
Material  factors  and  assumptions  upon  which  such  forward-looking  statements  are  based  include: 
that the required approvals to the Arrangement will be obtained from the Orex Securityholders and 
all  other  required  third  party,  Court,  regulatory  and  governmental  bodies;  assumptions  made  in 
connection with the preparation of the pro forma financial statements included herein; that all other 
conditions to the completion of the Arrangement will be satisfied or waived; that the future business 
operations and prospects of Orex and Spinco will be consistent with the current expectations of Orex 
and  Spinco;  that  the  expected  benefits  of  the  Arrangement  will  be  realized;  that  projections  are 
accurate; as well as the long-term metals and consumable commodity prices and foreign exchange 
rates. These assumptions are based on factors and events that are not within the control of Orex or 
Spinco and there is no assurance they will prove to be correct.
1
In certain cases, forward-looking  statements can be identified by the use of  words such as "plans", 
"expects"  or  "does  not  expect",  "is  expected",  "budget",  "potential",  "scheduled",  "estimates", 
"forecasts", "intends", "anticipates" or "does not anticipate", or "believes", or variations of such words 
and  phrases  or  statements  that  certain  actions,  events  or  results  "will",  "may",  "could",  "would", 
"might"  or  "will  be  taken",  "occur"  or  "be  achieved"  or  the  negative  of  these  terms  or  comparable 
terminology.  By their very nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, 
uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of 
Orex  and  Spinco  to  be  materially  different  from  any  future  results,  performance  or  achievements 
expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. A variety of material factors include, among 
others: failure to complete the Arrangement could negatively impact the market price of Orex Shares 
and  future  business  and  financial  results;  Orex  and  Spinco  may  be  subject  to  significant  capital 
requirements and operating risks; as well as those risks described under the headings "Risk Factors" in 
Appendix  E  –  "Information  Concerning  Orex  After  the  Arrangement"  and  Appendix  F  –  "Information 
Concerning Spinco After the Arrangement", as well as any other risk factors detailed from time to time in

important  factors  that  could  cause  actual  actions,  events  or  results  to  differ  materially  from  those 
described  in  forward-looking  statements,  there  may  be  other  factors  that  cause  actions,  events  or 
results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. Orex and Spinco provide no assurance that 
forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ 
materially  from  those  anticipated  in  such  statements.    Orex  and  Spinco  do  not  intend,  and  do  not 
assume  any  obligation,  to  update  any  forward-looking  statements,  other  than  as  required  by 
applicable  Laws.  Accordingly,  readers  should  not  place  undue  reliance  on  forward-looking 
statements.
NOTE TO UNITED STATES SECURITY HOLDERS
THE ARRANGEMENT AND THE SECURITIES TO BE ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH THE 
ARRANGEMENT  HAVE  NOT  BEEN  REGISTERED  WITH,  RECOMMENDED  BY,  OR 
APPROVED  OR  DISAPPROVED  BY  THE  SEC  OR  THE  SECURITIES  REGULATORY 
AUTHORITIES  IN  ANY  STATE,  NOR  HAS  THE  SEC  OR  THE  SECURITIES  REGULATORY 
AUTHORITIES  OF  ANY  STATE  PASSED  UPON  THE  FAIRNESS  OR  MERITS  OF  THE 
ARRANGEMENT  OR  UPON  THE  ADEQUACY  OR  ACCURACY  OF  THIS  CIRCULAR.    ANY 
REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.
The  New  Common  Shares  and  Spinco  Shares  to  be  issued  and  distributed  to  Orex  Shareholders 
pursuant  to  the  Arrangement,  the  New  Orex  Options  and  Spinco  Options  to  be  received  by  Orex 
Optionholders in exchange for their Orex Options and the New Orex Warrants and Spinco Warrants 
to be received by Orex Warrantholders in exchange for their Orex Warrants have not been registered 
under  the  U.S.  Securities  Act  or  applicable  state Securities  Laws,  and  are being  issued,  distributed 
and exchanged, as applicable, in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the 
U.S. Securities Act set forth in Section 3(a)(10) thereof (the "Section 3(a)(10) Exemption") on the basis 
of  the  approval  of  the  Court,  which  will  consider,  among  other  things,  the  fairness  of  the 
Arrangement  to  Orex  Securityholders  as  further  described  in  this  Circular  under  the  heading  "The 
Meeting - The Arrangement  – TSX-V Requirements,  Regulatory Law and Securities  Law Matters", and in 
reliance on exemptions from registration under applicable state Securities Laws.
The  solicitation  of  proxies  for  the  Meeting  made  pursuant  to  this  Circular  is  not  subject  to  the 
requirements of Section 14(a) of the U.S. Exchange Act by virtue of an exemption applicable to proxy 
solicitations  by  foreign  private  issuers  (as  defined  in  Rule  3b-4  under  the  U.S.  Exchange  Act).
2
Accordingly, this Circular has been prepared in accordance with disclosure requirements applicable 
in  Canada.  Orex  Securityholders  in  the  United  States  should  be  aware  that  such  requirements  are 
different  from  those  of  the  United  States  applicable  to  registration  statements  under  the  U.S. 
Securities Act and to proxy statements under the U.S. Exchange Act.
The financial statements and information included or incorporated by reference in this Circular have 
been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard ("IAS") 34, "Interim Financial 
Reporting" using accounting policies consistent with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards  Board  ("IASB")  and  interpretations  issued  by  the  International  Financial  Reporting 
Interpretations Committee ("IFRIC") and Canadian generally accepted accounting principles and are 
subject to Canadian auditing and auditor independence standards and thus may not be comparable 
to financial statements prepared in accordance with United States standards.
Information concerning the properties and operations of Orex has been prepared in accordance with 
Canadian disclosure standards under applicable Canadian corporate and Securities Laws, and may 
not be comparable to similar information prepared in accordance with United States standards.  In 
particular,  disclosure  of  scientific  or  technical  information  in  this  Circular  has  been  made  in 
accordance  with  NI  43-101.  NI  43-101  is  a  rule  developed  by  the  Canadian  Institute  of  Mining, 
Metallurgy  and  Petroleum  and  incorporated  into  a  national  instrument  issued  by  the  Canadian 
Securities  Administrators  that  establishes  standards  for  all  public  disclosure  an  issuer  makes  of 
scientific  and  technical  information  concerning  mineral  projects.  The  terms  "measured  mineral 
resources", "indicated mineral resources" and "inferred mineral resources" are used in this Circular 
to comply with the reporting standards in Canada. There is a great amount of uncertainty as to the 
existence  of  "measured  mineral  resources",  "indicated  mineral  resources"  and  "inferred  mineral 
resources", and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. While "measured mineral 
resources",  "indicated  mineral  resources"  and  "inferred  mineral  resources"  are  recognized  and 
required by Canadian regulations, these terms are not defined terms under standards established by 
the SEC. Accordingly, information contained in this  Circular containing descriptions  of Orex's and 
Spinco's respective mineral properties may not be comparable to similar information made public by 
United  States  companies  subject  to  the  reporting  and  disclosure  requirements  of  the  SEC.  For 
example, under United States standards, mineralization  may not be classified as a  "reserve" unless 
the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced 
or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. Orex Securityholders are cautioned not 
to assume that all or any part of measured mineral resources or indicated mineral resources will 
ever be converted into mineral reserves or that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists 
or is economically or legally mineable. Orex Securityholders are also cautioned not to assume that 
all  or  any  part  of  measured  mineral  resources,  indicated  mineral  resources  or  inferred  mineral 
resources will ever be upgraded to a higher category. In accordance with Canadian rules, estimates of 
inferred mineral resources cannot form the basis of feasibility or other economic studies. In addition, 
the definitions of proven and probable mineral reserves used in NI 43-101 differ from SEC standards 
as set forth in SEC Industry Guide 7. Disclosure of "contained ounces" is permitted disclosure under 
Canadian regulations, however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that 
does not constitute reserves as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures.
Orex Securityholders who are resident in, or citizens of, the United States are advised to consult their 
own  tax  advisors  to  determine  the  particular  United  States  tax  consequences  to  them  of  the 
Arrangement  in  light  of  their  particular  situation,  as  well  as  any  tax  consequences  that  may  arise 
under the Laws of any other relevant foreign, state, local, or other taxing jurisdiction. No ruling from 
the International Revenue Service or legal opinions have been or will be sought with respect to any of 
the tax consequences relating to the transaction described herein, including, without limitation, with 
respect to income, estate, gift or other tax consequences.
3
The  enforcement  by  Orex  Securityholders  of  civil  liabilities  under  U.S.  Securities  Laws  may  be 
affected adversely by the fact that each of Orex and Spinco is incorporated or organized outside the 
United States, and that some or all of their officers and directors and the experts named herein are 
residents  of  a  foreign  country  and  that  all  or  a  portion  of  the  assets  of  Orex  and  Spinco  and  said 
persons are located outside the United States.  As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for Orex 
Securityholders in the United States to effect service of process within the United States upon Orex 
and  Spinco,  their  respective  officers  or  directors  or  the  experts  named  herein,  or  to  realize  against 
them upon judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon civil liabilities under the federal 
Securities  Laws  of  the  United  States  or  "blue  sky"  laws  of  any  state  within  the  United  States.    In 
addition, Orex Securityholders in the United States should not assume that the courts of Canada: (a) 
would  allow  Orex  Securityholders  in  the  United  States  to  sue  Orex  or  Spinco,  or  their  respective 
officers  or  directors,  in  the  courts  of  Canada;  (b)  would  enforce  judgments  of  United  States  courts 
obtained in actions against such Persons predicated upon civil liabilities under the federal Securities 
Laws  of  the  United  States  or  "blue  sky"  laws  of  any  state  within  the  United  States;  or  (c)  would 
enforce, in original actions, liabilities against such Persons predicated upon civil liabilities under the 
federal Securities Laws of the United States or "blue sky" laws of any state within the United States.
The New Common Shares and Spinco Shares to be received by Orex Shareholders pursuant to the 
Arrangement  will  be  freely  transferable  under  U.S.  Securities  Laws,  except  Persons  who  are 
"affiliates" (as such term in understood under U.S. Securities Laws) of Orex or Spinco, as applicable, 
after the Effective Date, or were "affiliates" of Orex or Spinco, as applicable, within 90 days prior to 
the Effective Date.  Persons who may be deemed to be "affiliates" of an issuer include individuals or 
entities  that  control,  are  controlled  by,  or  are  under  common  control  with,  the  issuer,  whether 
through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise, and generally include executive 
officers and directors of the issuer as well as principal shareholders of the issuer.  Any resale of such 
New Common Shares or Spinco Shares by such an affiliate (or former affiliate) may be subject to the 
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act, absent an exemption therefrom.
The  exemption  from  the  registration  requirements  of  the  U.S.  Securities  Act  provided  by  Section 
3(a)(10) thereof does not exempt the issuance of securities upon the exercise of securities that were 
previously  issued  pursuant  to  Section  3(a)(10)  of  the  U.S.  Securities  Act.    Therefore,  the  New 
Common Shares issuable upon the exercise of the New Orex Options or New Orex Warrants and the 
Spinco Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Spinco Options or Spinco Warrants may not be issued 
in reliance upon the exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act provided 
by  Section  3(a)(10)  thereof  and  the  New  Orex  Options,  Spinco  Options,  New  Orex  Warrants  and 
Spinco  Warrants  may  be  exercised  only  pursuant  to  an  available  exemption  from  the  registration 
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state Securities Laws.  Prior to the issuance of 
New Common Shares and Spinco Shares pursuant to any such exercise, Orex or Spinco, as applicable, 
may require evidence (which may include an opinion of counsel) reasonably satisfactory to Orex or 
Spinco, as applicable, to the effect that the issuance of such shares does not require registration under 
the U.S. Securities Act or applicable state Securities Laws.
New  Common  Shares  or  Spinco  Shares  received  upon  exercise  of  the  New  Orex  Options,  Spinco 
Options,  New  Orex  Warrants  or  Spinco  Warrants  by  holders  in  the  United  States  or  who  are  U.S. 
Persons  will  be  "restricted  securities,"  as  such  term  is  defined  in  Rule  144,  and  may  not  be  resold 
unless such securities are registered under the U.S. Securities Act and all applicable state Securities 
Laws or unless an exemption from such registration requirements is available.
No broker, dealer, salesperson or other Person has been authorized to give any information or make 
any representation other than those contained in this Circular and, if given or made, such information 
or representation must not be relied upon as having been authorized hereunder.

formality:
Dissent Securities
(a)
all  Dissent  Securities  held  by  Dissenting  Securityholders  will  be  deemed  to  have  been 
transferred  to  Orex  and  each  Dissenting  Securityholder  will  cease  to  have  any  right  as  an

Orex  Securityholder  other  than  a  right  to  be  paid  by  Orex  the  fair  value  for  such  Dissent 
Securities;
Alteration of Capital of Orex and Exchange of Orex Shares for New Common Shares and Spinco Shares
(b)
the share capital of Orex will be reorganized such that:
(i)
(ii)
the authorized share capital will be amended by the creation of a new class 
of shares consisting of an unlimited number of New Common Shares;
each outstanding Orex Share will be exchanged for one New Common Share 
and one Spinco Share and such Orex Share will be cancelled; and
(c)
the stated capital of Orex for the outstanding New Common Shares will be an amount equal 
to  the  paid-up  capital  for  the  purpose  of  the  Tax  Act  of  Orex  for  the  Orex  Shares,  less  the 
amount  determined  by  the  Orex  Board  as  being  the  fair  value  of  the  Spinco  Shares 
distributed on such exchange.
Arrangement of Orex Options
(d)
in respect of the Orex Options:
(i)
each Orex Option outstanding immediately before the Effective Time will be 
and will be deemed to be exchanged for:

(B)
one fully-vested New Orex Option to purchase from Orex one New 
Common  Share.  Each  New  Orex  Option  will  be  governed  by  the 
terms of the New Orex Option Plan and will have an exercise price 
per  New  Common  Share  (rounded  up  to  the  nearest  whole  cent) 
equal  to  the  exercise  price  of  each  Orex  Option  so  exchanged 
multiplied by the Valuation Factor; and
one fully-vested Spinco Option to purchase from Spinco one Spinco 
Share.  Each  Spinco  Option  will  be  governed  by  the  terms  of  the 
Spinco Option Plan and will have an exercise price per Spinco Share 
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price of 
each  Orex  Option  so  exchanged  multiplied  by  a  number  which  is 
equal to one (1) minus the Valuation Factor; and
(ii)
the Orex Option Plan will be terminated;
Arrangement of Orex Warrants
(e)
in respect of the Orex Warrants:
(i)
each Orex Warrant outstanding immediately before  the Effective Time  will 
be and will be deemed to be exchanged for:
(A)
one  New  Orex  Warrant  to  purchase  from  Orex  one  New  Common 
Share. Each New Orex Warrant will be governed by the terms of the 
New  Orex  Warrant  Certificates  and  will  have  an  exercise  price  per
14
New Common Share equal to the exercise price of the Orex Warrant 
for which such New Orex Warrant was exchanged; and
(B)
one Spinco Warrant to purchase from Spinco one Spinco Share. Each 
Spinco Warrant will be governed by the terms of the Spinco Warrant 
Certificates and will have an exercise price per Spinco Share  equal to

Warrant was exchanged ; and
(ii)
as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Orex will deliver to each Orex 
Warrantholder a New Orex Warrant Certificate in respect of the New Orex 
Warrants  and  Spinco  will  deliver  to  each  Orex  Warrantholder  a  Spinco 
Warrant  Certificate  in  respect  of  the  Spinco  Warrants,  and  thereupon  the 
Orex Warrant Certificates representing the Orex Warrants so exchanged will 
be terminated.
Background to the Arrangement
As announced originally by news release on February 1, 2013, the management of Orex and the Orex 
Board have been investigating the process and advisability of creating Spinco and transferring Orex's 
interest in the Barsele Project to Spinco for over two years. The Arrangement was postponed since the 
spring of 2013 due to market conditions, but as a result of the closing of the Gunnarn JV on June 11, 
2015,  Orex  obtained  the  necessary  financing  to  complete  the  Arrangement.  Management  of  Orex 
believes that there is potentially greater value that could be recognized in Orex's 45% interest in the 
Barsele Project and Orex's 100% interest in the Orex Projects if those interests were held and operated 
separately, rather than continuing to be held solely by Orex, and as a result, has decided to proceed 
with  the  Arrangement  in  order  to  meet  the  objectives  set  out  under  the  heading  "Reasons  for  the 
Arrangement" below.
Reasons for the Arrangement
The Orex Board has reviewed and considered a significant amount of information and considered a 
number  of  factors  relating  to  the  Arrangement  with  the  benefit  of  advice  from  Orex's  senior 
management  and  its  financial,  legal  and  technical  advisors.    The  following  is  a  summary  of  the 
principal reasons for the unanimous recommendation of the Orex Board that Orex Securityholders 
vote FOR the Arrangement Resolution:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
Separation  of  Assets.  The  separation  of  Orex's  assets  will  enable  management  to  advance 
Orex's and Spinco's mineral projects in a more focused and efficient manner.
Continued  Participation  by  Orex  Shareholders  in  the  Barsele  Project  Through  Spinco.  Orex 
Shareholders,  through  their  ownership  of  all  of  the  issued  and  outstanding  Spinco  Shares, 
will  continue  to  participate  in  the  value  associated  with  the  exploration,  development  and 
operation of the Barsele Project.
Continued Participation by Orex Shareholders in all of Orex's Other Projects. Orex Shareholders, 
through  their  ownership  of  all  of  the  issued  and  outstanding  New  Common  Shares,  will 
continue  to  participate  in  the  value  associated  with  the  exploration,  development  and 
operation of all of the Orex Projects.
Continuity of Management. The board of directors and officers of each of Orex and Spinco after 
the Arrangement will initially be the same directors and officers that currently manage Orex,
15
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
preserving  the  management  know-how  and  direction  of  Orex  for  the  benefit  of  both 
companies.
Approval  of  Orex  Securityholders  and  the  Court  are  Required.  The  Arrangement  must  be 
approved by: (i) at least two-thirds of the votes cast in respect of the Arrangement Resolution 
by Orex Shareholders and Orex Optionholders present in person or represented by proxy at 
the Meeting, voting together as a single class, on the basis of one vote per Orex Share and 
with each Orex Optionholder being entitled to that number of votes equal to the number of 
Orex Shares that such holder would be entitled to receive upon exercise of the Orex Options 
held  by  such  holder  as  of  the  Record  Date;  and (ii)  at  least  two-thirds  of  the  votes  cast  by 
Orex Warrantholders present in person or represented by proxy at the Meeting, voting as a 
single class, with each Orex Warrantholder being entitled to that number of votes equal to the 
number  of  Orex  Shares  that  such  holder  would be  entitled  to  receive  upon  exercise  of  the 
Orex  Warrants  held  by  such  holder  as  of  the  Record  Date.  The  Arrangement  must  also  be 
sanctioned  by  the  Court,  which  will  consider  the  fairness  of  the  Arrangement  to  Orex 
Securityholders.
Dissent Rights. Registered Orex Shareholders, Orex Optionholders and Orex Warrantholders 
who  oppose  the  Arrangement  may,  on  strict  compliance  with  certain  conditions,  exercise 
their Dissent Rights and receive the fair value of the Dissent Securities in accordance with the 
Arrangement.
See  "Cautionary  Note  Regarding  Forward-Looking  Statements"  and  "The  Meeting  –  The  Arrangement  – 
Reasons for the Arrangement".
Recommendation of the Orex Board
After  careful  consideration  of,  among  other  things,  the  factors  described  under  the  heading  "The 
Meeting  –  The  Arrangement  —  Reasons  for  the  Arrangement",  the  Orex  Board  has  unanimously 
determined that the Plan of Arrangement is fair to Orex Securityholders and is in the best interests of 
Orex. Accordingly, the Orex Board unanimously recommends that Orex Securityholders vote FOR 
the Arrangement Resolution.
Orex Option Plan and Treatment of Orex Options
Pursuant to the Arrangement, each Orex Option outstanding immediately before the Effective Time 
will  be  exchanged  for:  (a)  one  fully-vested  New  Orex  Option  to  purchase  from  Orex  one  New 
Common Share; and (b) one fully-vested Spinco Option to purchase from Spinco one Spinco Share. 
Each New Orex Option will be governed by the terms of the New Orex Option  Plan, will have an 
exercise price per New Common Share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise 
price of each Orex Option so exchanged multiplied by the Valuation Factor and will have an expiry 
date equivalent to the respective expiry date of each Orex Option so exchanged. Each Spinco Option 
will be governed by the terms of the Spinco Option Plan, will have an exercise price per Spinco Share 
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price of each Orex Option so exchanged 
multiplied by a number which is equal to one (1) minus the Valuation Factor and will have an expiry 
date equivalent to the respective expiry date of each Orex Option so exchanged.
Upon completion of the Arrangement, the Orex Option Plan will be terminated.
Orex Optionholders who do not want to receive New Orex Options and Spinco Options in exchange 
for their Orex Options can exercise their vested Orex Options before the Effective Time, in accordance
16
with the terms of the Orex Option Plan, and participate in the Arrangement on the same basis as Orex 
Shareholders.
See "The Meeting – The Arrangement – Orex Option Plan and Treatment of Orex Options".
Treatment of Orex Warrants
Pursuant to the Arrangement, each Orex Warrant outstanding immediately before the Effective Time 
will be exchanged for: (a) one New Orex Warrant to purchase from Orex one New Common Share; 
and (b) one Spinco Warrant to purchase from Spinco one Spinco Share. Each New Orex Warrant will 
be governed by the terms of the New Orex Warrant Certificates, will have an exercise price per New 
Common Share equal to the exercise price of the Orex Warrant for which such New Orex Warrant 
was exchanged and will have an expiry date equivalent to the respective expiry date of each Orex 
Warrant so exchanged. Each Spinco Warrant  will be governed by the terms of the Spinco Warrant 
Certificates,  will  have  an  exercise  price  per  Spinco  Share  equal  to  the  exercise  price  of  the  Orex 
Warrant for which such Spinco Warrant was exchanged and will have an expiry date equivalent to 
the respective expiry date of each Orex Warrant so exchanged.
Upon completion of the Arrangement, the Orex Warrant Certificates will be terminated.
Orex  Warrantholders  who  do  not  want  to  receive  New  Orex  Warrants  and  Spinco  Warrants  in 
exchange  for  their  Orex  Warrants  may  exercise  their  Orex  Warrants  before  the  Effective  Time,  in 
accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  respective  Orex  Warrant  Certificates,  and  participate  in  the 
Arrangement on the same basis as Orex Shareholders.
See "The Meeting – The Arrangement – Treatment of Orex Warrants".
Orex After the Arrangement
Upon completion of the Arrangement, Orex will continue to hold the same mineral assets it currently 
holds, except the 45% interest in the Barsele Project, which is subject to the Gunnarn JV Agreement. 
Orex  will  remain  a  reporting  issuer  in  the  Provinces  of  British  Columbia,  Alberta,  Saskatchewan, 
Manitoba and Ontario and the New Orex Shares will be listed for trading on the TSX-V under the 
symbol  "REX".  Orex's  primary  objective  will  be  to  continue  to  conduct  exploration  on  the  Los 
Crestones Project and Jumping Josephine Project, to maintain the remaining properties and to seek 
opportunities to acquire interests in other mineral properties.  In particular, Orex's objective will be to 
carry  out  the  exploration  programs  recommended  in  the  Los  Crestones  Technical  Report  and  the 
Jumping  Josephine  Technical  Report  and  acquire  new  projects  of  interest.  See  Appendix  E  - 
"Information Concerning Orex After the Arrangement".
Spinco
Spinco is currently a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orex that was incorporated on February 20, 2013 to 
hold and operate the Barsele Project.  The registered and records office of Spinco is located at Suite 
1700,  666  Burrard  Street,  Vancouver,  British  Columbia  V6C  2X8.    Upon  completion  of  the 
Arrangement, Spinco expects that it  will be a reporting issuer in  the Province of British Columbia, 
Alberta,  Saskatchewan,  Manitoba  and  Ontario  and  will  have  a  45%  interest  in  the  Barsele  Project 
through its ownership of 45% of the Gunnarn Shares.  The Barsele Project is 100% owned by Gunnarn 
and is subject to the Gunnarn JV Agreement. AE Sweden is the owner of the remaining 55% of the 
Gunnarn Shares and is the operator of the Barsele Project. AE Sweden is a wholly-owned subsidiary 
of Agnico Eagle, a public  company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock 
Exchange.  Spinco has applied to the TSX-V for the listing of the Spinco Shares on the TSX-V. Any
17
listing is subject to Spinco fulfilling all of the requirements of the TSX-V; however, there can be no 
assurance  as  to  if  or  when  such  listing  will  occur.  See  Appendix  F  -  "Information  Concerning  Spinco 
After the Arrangement".

In order to receive New Orex Warrants and Spinco Warrants, as soon as practicable after the Effective 
Time  each  Orex  Warrantholder  must  deliver  to  Orex  at  its  head  office  the  certificate(s),  if  any, 
representing  such  holder's  Orex  Warrants  and  any  other  documentation  required  by  Orex  and 
Spinco.
19
As soon as practicable after receipt of such certificate(s), Orex and Spinco will deliver to each Orex 
Warrantholder certificates representing the New Orex Warrants and Spinco Warrants, respectively, 
which such Orex Warrantholder is entitled to receive under the Arrangement.
See "The Meeting – The Arrangement – Procedure for Exchange of Orex Warrants".
Right to Orex Shares and Spinco Shares
Only  Orex  Shareholders  immediately  before  the  Effective  Time  will  be  entitled  to  receive  New 
Common  Shares  and  Spinco  Shares.  Any  holder  of  Orex  Options  or  Orex  Warrants  who  has  not 
exercised his or her Orex Options or Orex Warrants respectively, before the Effective Time will not be 
entitled to receive New Common Shares and Spinco Shares pursuant to the Arrangement. See "The 
Meeting – The Arrangement – Orex Option Plan and Treatment of Orex Options" and "The Meeting – The 
Arrangement - Treatment of Orex Warrants" above.
Cancellation of Rights After Six Years
Any  certificate  which  immediately  before  the  Effective  Time  represented  outstanding  Orex  Shares 
and  which  has  not  been  surrendered,  with  all  other  documents  required  by  the  Depositary,  on  or 
before the date that is six years after the Effective Date, will cease to represent any claim against or 
interest  of  any  kind  or  nature  in  Orex  or  Spinco.  Accordingly,  Former  Orex  Shareholders  who 
deposit with the Depositary certificates representing Orex Shares after the sixth anniversary of the 
Effective Date will not receive New Common Shares, Spinco Shares or any other consideration in 
exchange  therefor,  will  not  own  any  interest  in  Orex  or  Spinco,  and  such  Former  Orex 
Shareholders will not be paid any other compensation.
Dissent Rights
The Interim Order provides that each Orex Securityholder will have the right to dissent and, if the 
Arrangement becomes effective, to have his or her Orex Securities cancelled in exchange for a cash 
payment from Orex equal to the fair value of his or her Orex Securities as of the day of the Meeting in 
accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Interim  Order.  In  order  to  validly  dissent,  an  Orex 
Securityholder  must  not  vote  any  Orex  Securities  in  respect  of  which  Dissent  Rights  have  been 
exercised in favour of the Arrangement Resolution, must provide Orex with written objection to the 
Arrangement by 10:00 a.m. (Vancouver time) on September 21, 2015, or two Business Days before any 
adjournment  or  postponement  of  the  Meeting,  and  must  otherwise  comply  with  the  Dissent 
Procedures provided in the Interim Order. A Non-Registered Holder who wishes to exercise Dissent 
Rights  must  arrange  for  the  Registered  Orex  Shareholder(s)  holding  its  Orex  Shares  to  deliver  the 
Dissent Notice. See "The Meeting - The Arrangement — Dissent Rights".
If a Dissenting Securityholder fails to strictly comply with the requirements of the Dissent Rights set 
out in the Interim Order, it will lose its Dissent Rights. The Dissent Rights are set out in their entirety 
in the Interim Order, the text of which is set out in Appendix D to this Circular.
Income Tax Considerations
Summary of Certain Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations
A summary of the principal Canadian federal income tax considerations generally applicable under 
the  Tax  Act  to  Holders  in  respect  of  the  Arrangement  are  described  under  the  heading  "Certain 
Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations" in this Circular.
20
Summary of Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations
Orex Securityholders who are resident in, or citizens of, the United States are advised to consult their 
own  tax  advisors  to  determine  the  particular  United  States  tax  consequences  to  them  of  the 
Arrangement  in  light  of  their  particular  situation,  as  well  as  any  tax  consequences  that  may  arise 
under  the  Laws  of  any  other  relevant  foreign,  state,  local,  or  other  taxing  jurisdiction.    No  rulings 
from the Internal Revenue Service or legal opinions have been or will be sought with respect to any of 
the tax consequences relating to the transaction described herein including, without limitation, with 
respect to income, estate, gift or other tax consequences.
Court Approval
The Arrangement requires Court approval under the Business Corporations Act. In addition to this 
approval, the Court will be asked for a declaration following a Court hearing that the Arrangement is 
fair to the Orex Securityholders. Before the mailing of this Circular, Orex obtained the Interim Order 
providing for the calling and holding of the Meeting, the Dissent Rights and certain other procedural 
matters. Following receipt of Orex Securityholder Approval, Orex intends to make application to the 
Court  for  the  Final  Order  at  9:45  a.m.  (Vancouver  time),  or  as  soon  thereafter  as  counsel  may  be 
heard, on September 24, 2015 at the Courthouse, 800 Smithe Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, or 
at  any  other  date  and  time  as  the  Court  may  direct.  Stikeman  Elliott  LLP,  counsel  to  Orex,  has 
advised  that,  in  deciding  whether  to  grant  the  Final  Order,  the  Court  will  consider,  among  other 
things, the fairness of the Arrangement to Orex Securityholders.
Any  Orex  Securityholder  who  wishes  to  appear  or  be  represented  and  to  present  evidence  or 
arguments  at  that  hearing  must  file  and  serve  a  response  to  petition  no  later  than  5:00  p.m. 
(Vancouver time) on September 21, 2015 along with any other documents required, all as set out in 
the Interim Order and Notice of Petition, the text of which are set out in Appendix D to this Circular 
and,  satisfy  any  other  requirements  of  the  Court.  Such  Persons  should  consult  with  their  legal 
advisors as to the necessary requirements.
The Court may approve the Arrangement either as proposed or as amended in any manner the Court 
may direct, and subject to compliance with such terms and conditions, if any, as the Court sees fit.
The  Court  will  be  informed,  before  the  hearing,  that  the  Final  Order  will  form  the  basis  for  an 
exemption  from  registration  of  the  New  Common  Shares  and  the  Spinco  Shares  to  be  issued, 
distributed  and  exchanged,  as  applicable,  and  the  New  Orex  Options,  Spinco  Options,  New  Orex 
Warrants and Spinco Warrants issued, distributed and exchanged, as applicable, in connection with 
the Arrangement under the U.S. Securities Act pursuant to Section 3(a)(10) thereof. See "The Meeting – 
The Arrangement — Court Approval of the Arrangement".
Regulatory Law Matters and Securities Law Matters
Orex  is  a  reporting  issuer  in  British  Columbia,  Alberta,  Saskatchewan,  Manitoba  and  Ontario.  The 
Orex  Shares  currently  trade  on  the  TSX-V.  The  New  Common  Shares  are  expected  to  commence 
trading on the TSX-V within 3 Business Days of the completion of the Arrangement.
Upon  completion  of  the  Arrangement,  Spinco  expects  that  it  will  be  a  reporting  issuer  in  British 
Columbia,  Alberta,  Saskatchewan,  Manitoba  and  Ontario.  Spinco  has  applied  for  the  listing  of  the 
Spinco Shares on the TSX-V. Any listing will be subject to meeting the initial listing requirements of 
the TSX-V. There can be no assurance as to if, or when, the Spinco Shares will be listed or traded on 
the TSX-V or any other stock exchange.
21
As the Spinco Shares are not listed on a stock exchange, unless and until such a listing is obtained, 
holders of Spinco Shares may not have a market for their shares.
Canadian Securities Laws Matters
The  distribution  of  the  New  Common  Shares,  Spinco  Shares,  New  Orex  Options,  Spinco  Options, 
Spinco Warrants and New Orex Warrants pursuant to the Arrangement will constitute a distribution 
of securities which is exempt from the prospectus requirements of Canadian Securities Laws and is 
exempt from or otherwise is not subject to the registration requirements under applicable Canadian 
Securities Laws.  The New Common Shares, Spinco Shares, Spinco Warrants and New Orex Warrants 
(provided  the  Orex  Warrants  for  which  such  Spinco  Warrants  and  New  Orex  Warrants  were 
exchanged were transferrable) received pursuant to the Arrangement will not bear any legend under 
Canadian Securities Laws and may be resold through registered dealers in each of the provinces of 
Canada provided that: (a) Spinco after the Arrangement and Orex is and has been a reporting issuer 
in a jurisdiction in Canada for the four months immediately preceding the trade; (b) the trade is not a 
"control distribution" as defined in NI 45-102; (c) no unusual effort is made to prepare the market or 
to create a demand for the New Common Shares and Spinco Shares; (d) no extraordinary commission 
or consideration is paid to a Person in respect of such sale; and (e) if the selling securityholder is an 
insider or officer of Orex or Spinco, the selling securityholder has no reasonable grounds to believe 
that Orex or Spinco is in default of applicable Securities Laws. For the purposes of (a) above, Spinco 
satisfies  the  four  month  requirement  by  virtue  of  the  fact  that  it  is  a  party  to  the  Arrangement 
Agreement with Orex, which will have been a reporting issuer in a jurisdiction in Canada for at least 
four months prior to the date of distribution.
Each  Orex  Shareholder  is  urged  to  consult  his,  her  or  its  professional  advisors  to  determine  the 
Canadian conditions and restrictions applicable to trades in New Common Shares and Spinco Shares.
See "The Meeting – The Arrangement – TSX-V Requirements, Regulatory Law and Securities Law Matters".
United States Securities Laws Matters
None  of  the  New  Common  Shares  and  the  Spinco  Shares  issued,  distributed  and  exchanged,  as 
applicable,  pursuant  to  the  Arrangement,  nor  the  New  Orex  Options,  Spinco  Options,  New  Orex 
Warrants  or  Spinco  Warrants,  have  been  or  will  be  registered  under  the  U.S.  Securities  Act  or  the 
Securities Laws of any state of the United States and will each be issued, distributed and exchanged, 
as applicable, in reliance  upon  the exemption from registration provided by Section 3(a)(10) of the 
U.S. Securities Act and similar exemptions provided under the Securities Laws of each state of the 
United States in which Orex Securityholders reside.  The New Common Shares and Spinco Shares, as 
applicable,  issuable  upon  exercise  of  the  New  Orex  Options,  Spinco  Options,  New  Orex  Warrants 
and Spinco Warrants will not be exempt pursuant to Section 3(a)(10) of the U.S. Securities Act and 
therefore may only be issued if the issuance is registered under the U.S. Securities Act pursuant to 
another exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act.
The  restrictions  on  resale  of  shares  imposed  by  the  U.S.  Securities  Act  will  depend  on  whether  a 
holder  of  the  New  Common  Shares  or  the  Spinco  Shares,  as  applicable,  issued  or  distributed 
pursuant to the Arrangement is an "affiliate" of Orex or Spinco after the Arrangement.  As defined in 
Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act, an "affiliate" of an issuer is a person that directly, or indirectly, 
through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, 
such issuer.
The Spinco Shares will not be a registered class of securities in the United States and will not be listed 
for trading on a stock exchange in the United States.
22
See "Regulatory Law Matters and Securities Law Matters – United States Securities Laws".
Risk Factors
Orex Securityholders should carefully consider the risk factors relating to the Arrangement. Some of 
these risks include, but are not limited to: the Arrangement Agreement may be terminated in certain 
circumstances;  there  can  be  no  certainty  that  all  conditions  precedent  to  the  Arrangement  will  be 
satisfied; Orex will incur costs even if the Arrangement is not completed; the market price of Orex 
Shares  may  decline  if  the  Arrangement  is  not  completed;  the  issue  of  New  Orex  Shares  under  the 
Arrangement may cause the market price of New Orex Shares to decline; and there is currently no 
market  for  the  Spinco  Shares.  For  more  information  see  "The  Meeting  –  The  Arrangement  -  Risks 
Associated with the Arrangement".
Additional risks and uncertainties, including those currently unknown or considered immaterial by 
Orex  may  also  adversely  affect  the  Orex  Shares,  the  New  Common  Shares,  the  Spinco  Shares,  the 
New Orex Options, the Spinco Options, the New Orex Warrants, the Spinco Warrants or the business 
of  Spinco  or  Orex  following  the  Arrangement.    In  addition  to  the  risk  factors  relating  to  the 
Arrangement  set  out  in  this  Circular,  Orex  Securityholders  should  also  carefully  consider  the  risk 
factors  associated  with  the  businesses  of  Orex  after  the  Arrangement  and  Spinco  included  in  this 
Circular, including the documents incorporated by reference therein. See "Information Concerning Orex 
After  the  Arrangement  -  Risk  Factors"  and  "Information  Concerning  Spinco  After  the  Arrangement  -  Risk 
Factors".
GENERAL PROXY INFORMATION
Solicitation of Proxies
This Circular is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the management of Orex 
for use at the Meeting, to be held on September 23, 2015, at the time and place and for the purposes 
set  forth  in  the  accompanying  Notice  of  Meeting.  While  it  is  expected  that  the  solicitation  will  be 
primarily by mail, proxies may be solicited personally or by telephone by the directors, officers and 
regular employees of Orex at nominal cost. All costs of solicitation by management will be borne by 
Orex.
How a Vote is Passed
At the Meeting, Orex Securityholders will be asked, among other things, to consider and to vote to 
approve the Arrangement Resolution. To be effective, the Arrangement Resolution must be approved 
by: (i) at least two-thirds of the votes cast by Orex Shareholders and Orex Optionholders present in 
person or represented by proxy at the Meeting, voting together as a single class, on the basis of one 
vote per Orex Share and with each Orex Optionholder being entitled to that number of votes equal to 
the number of Orex Shares that such holder would be entitled to receive upon exercise of the Orex 
Options held by such holder as of the Record Date; and (ii) at least two-thirds of the votes cast by 
Orex Warrantholders present in person or represented by proxy at the Meeting, voting as a single 
class, with each Orex Warrantholder being entitled to that number of votes equal to the number of 
Orex Shares that such holder would be entitled to receive upon exercise of the Orex Warrants held by 
such holder as of the Record Date.
All  of  the  other  matters  that  will  come  to  a  vote  at  the  Meeting,  as  described  in  this  Circular,  are 
ordinary resolutions and can be passed by a simple majority of Orex Shareholders— that is, if more 
than half of the votes of Orex Shareholders that are cast are in favour, the resolution is approved.
23
The  quorum  for  the  Meeting  is  one  person  who  is,  or  represents  by  proxy,  an  Orex  Shareholder 
entitled to vote at the Meeting.
Who can vote?
If you are a Registered Orex Shareholder, Orex Optionholder or Orex Warrantholder as at August 17, 
2015,  you  are  entitled  to  attend  at  the  Meeting  and  cast  a  vote  for  the  Arrangement  Resolution. 
Additionally, if you are a Registered Orex Shareholder, you are entitled to attend the Meeting and 
cast  a  vote  for  each  Orex  Share  registered  in  your  name  on  all  other  resolutions  put  before  the 
Meeting. If the Orex Securities are registered in the name of a corporation, a duly authorized officer 
of  the  corporation  may  attend  on  its  behalf,  but  documentation  indicating  such  officer's  authority 
should be presented at the Meeting. If you are a Registered Orex Shareholder, Orex Optionholder or 
Orex  Warrantholder  but  do  not  wish  to,  or  cannot,  attend  the  Meeting  in  person  you  can  appoint 
someone who will attend the Meeting and act as your proxyholder to vote in accordance with your 
instructions.  If  your  Orex  Shares  are  registered  in  the  name  of  a  ''nominee''  (usually  a  bank,  trust 
company, securities dealer or other financial institution) you should refer to the section entitled ''Non-
Registered Holders'' set out below.
It is important that your Orex Securities be represented at the Meeting regardless of the number of 
Orex Securities you hold. If you will not be attending the Meeting in person, we encourage you to 
complete, date, sign and return your form of proxy as soon as possible so that your Orex Securities 
will be represented.
What is a Proxy?
A form of proxy is a document that authorizes someone to attend the Meeting and cast your votes for 
you.  We  have  enclosed  a  form  of  proxy  with  this  Circular.  You  should  use  it  to  appoint  a 
proxyholder, although you can also use any other legal form of proxy.
Appointing a Proxyholder
The persons named in the enclosed form of proxy are Gary Cope and N. Ross Wilmot, the President 
and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  respectively,  of  Orex.  AN  OREX 
SECURITYHOLDER  WHO  WISHES  TO  APPOINT  SOME  OTHER  PERSON  TO  REPRESENT 
SUCH OREX SECURITYHOLDER AT THE MEETING MAY DO SO BY CROSSING OUT THE 
NAME  ON  THE  FORM  OF  PROXY  AND  INSERTING  THE  NAME  OF  THE  PERSON 
PROPOSED IN THE BLANK SPACE PROVIDED IN THE ENCLOSED FORM OF PROXY. SUCH 
OTHER  PERSON  NEED  NOT  BE  AN  OREX  SECURITYHOLDER.  TO  VOTE  YOUR  OREX 
SECURITIES, YOUR PROXYHOLDER MUST ATTEND THE MEETING. If you do not fill a name 
in the blank space in the enclosed form of proxy, the persons named in the form of proxy (Gary Cope 
and  N.  Ross  Wilmot,  the  President  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer, 
respectively) are appointed to act as your proxyholder.
Regardless  of  who  you  appoint  as  your  proxyholder,  you  can  either  instruct  that  person  or 
company  how  you  want  to  vote  or  you  can  let  him  or  her  decide  for  you.  You  can  do  this  by 
completing a form of proxy. In order to be valid, you must return the completed form of proxy 
forty-eight (48) hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, before the time of the Meeting 
or  any  adjournment  or  postponement  thereof  to  our  transfer  agent,  Computershare,  by  toll  free 
North  American  fax  number  1-866-249-7775,  or  by  international  fax  number  1-416-863-9524. 
Alternatively,  you  may  submit  your  vote  on  the  internet  at  www.investorvote.com,  or  by 
telephone at 1-866-734-8683 (toll free in North America).
24
Instructing your Proxy and Exercise of Discretion by your Proxy
You  may  indicate  on  your  form  of  proxy  how  you  wish  your  proxyholder  to  vote  your  Orex 
Securities. To do this, simply mark the appropriate boxes on the form of proxy. If you do this, your 
proxyholder must vote your Orex Securities in accordance with the instructions you have given.
If  you  do  not  give  any  instructions  as  to  how  to  vote  on  a  particular  issue  to  be  decided  at  the 
Meeting, your proxyholder can vote your securities as he or she thinks fit.
If you are an Orex Shareholder and have appointed the persons designated in the form of proxy as 
your  proxyholder  they  will,  unless  you  give  contrary  instructions,  vote  your  Orex  Shares  at  the 
Meeting as follows:
(cid:57)(cid:57) FOR the election of the proposed nominees as directors;
(cid:57) FOR the reappointment of Davidson & Company LLP, Chartered Professional Accountants, as 
the auditor of Orex and to authorize the directors to fix the remuneration to be paid to the 
auditor;
(cid:57) FOR the approval of the Arrangement Resolution; and
(cid:57) FOR the adoption of the New Orex Option Plan and the Spinco Option Plan.
If you are an Orex Optionholder or Orex Warrantholder and have appointed the persons designated 
in the form of proxy as your proxyholder they will, unless you give contrary instructions, vote your 
Orex Options or Orex Warrants, as applicable, at the Meeting as follows:
(cid:57) FOR the approval of the Arrangement Resolution.
Further details about these matters are set out in this Circular. The enclosed form of proxy gives the 
persons named on it the authority to use their discretion in voting on amendments or variations to 
matters identified on the Notice of Meeting. At the time of printing this Circular, the management of 
Orex is not aware of any other matter to be presented for action at the Meeting. If, however, other 
matters do properly come before the Meeting, the persons named on the enclosed form of proxy will 
vote  on  them  in  accordance  with  their  best  judgment,  pursuant  to  the  discretionary  authority 
conferred by the form of proxy with respect to such matters.
Revocability of Proxy
A Registered Orex Shareholder, Orex Optionholder or Orex Warrantholder who has given a proxy 
may  revoke  it  by  an  instrument  in  writing  executed  by  such  Registered  Orex  Shareholder,  Orex 
Optionholder or Orex Warrantholder or by his or her attorney authorized in writing or, where the 
Orex Securityholder is a corporation, by a duly authorized officer or attorney of the corporation, and 
delivered to the Head Office of Orex at Suite 1130 – 1055 West Hastings Street, Vancouver, BC, V6E 
2E9,  at  any  time  up  to  and  including  by  4:00  p.m.  (Vancouver  Time)  on  the  last  Business  Day 
preceding the day of the Meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, or to the Chairman 
of the Meeting on the day of the Meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, or in any 
other manner provided by Law. A revocation of a proxy does not affect any matter on which a vote 
has been taken before the revocation.
25
Voting by Orex Securityholders
Only  Registered  Orex  Shareholders,  Orex  Optionholders,  Orex  Warrantholders  or  duly  appointed 
proxyholders are permitted to vote in person at the Meeting. A holder of Orex Shares may own such 
shares  in  one  or  both  of  the  following  ways.  If  an  Orex  Shareholder  is  in  possession  of  a  physical 
share certificate, such Orex Shareholder is a Registered Orex Shareholder and his, her or its name and 
address  are  maintained  by  Orex  through  the  Transfer  Agent.  If  an  Orex  Shareholder  owns  Orex 
Shares  through  a  bank,  broker,  nominee,  or  other  Intermediary  such  Orex  Shareholder  is  a  "Non-
Registered Holder" or "beneficial" Orex Shareholder and he, she or it will not have a physical share 
certificate.  Such  Orex  Shareholder  will  have  an  account  statement  from  his  or  her  Intermediary  as 
evidence of share ownership.
If you are not sure whether you are a Registered Orex Shareholder, please contact Computershare toll 
free in North America at 1-800-564-6253 or collect at 1-514-982-7555.
A Registered Orex Shareholder, Orex Optionholder or Orex Warrantholder may vote a proxy in his, 
her, or its own name at any time by facsimile, internet or by mail in accordance with the instructions 
appearing  on  the  enclosed  form  of  proxy  and/or  may  attend  the  Meeting  and  vote  in  person.  
Because  a  Registered  Orex  Shareholder,  Orex  Optionholder  and  Orex  Warrantholder  is  known  to 
Orex  and  the  Transfer  Agent,  his,  her,  or  its  account  can  be  confirmed  and  his,  her,  or  its  vote 
recorded or changed if such Registered Orex Shareholder, Orex Optionholder or Orex Warrantholder 
has previously voted.
Non-Registered Holders
Most  Orex Shareholders are Non-Registered Holders or "beneficial"  Orex Shareholders. Their  Orex 
Shares are registered in the name of an Intermediary, such as a securities broker, financial institution, 
trustee, custodian or other nominee who holds the shares on their behalf, or in the name of a clearing 
agency,  such  as  The  Canadian  Depository  for  Securities  Limited  (CDS)  or  the  Depository  Trust  & 
Clearing  Corporation  (DTC),  in  which  the  Intermediary  is  a  participant.    Intermediaries  have 
obligations to forward meeting materials to Non-Registered Holders, unless otherwise instructed by 
the holder (and as required by regulation in some cases, despite instructions).
In accordance with the requirements of the Canadian Securities Administrators and NI 54-101, Orex 
has caused its agent to distribute copies of the Meeting Materials directly to NOBOs – that is, Non-
Registered  Holders  who  have  provided  instructions  to  an  Intermediary  that  such  Non-Registered 
Holder  does  not  object  to  the  Intermediary  disclosing  ownership  information  about  the  beneficial 
owner.
The Meeting Materials distributed by Orex's agent to NOBOs include a VIF. A NOBO may vote using 
a VIF in his, her or its own name at any time by facsimile, internet or by mail in accordance with the 
instructions appearing on the enclosed VIF.  The Transfer Agent will tabulate the results of the votes 
received  from  NOBOs  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  appearing  on  the  enclosed  VIF  and  will 
provide appropriate instructions at the Meeting with respect to those votes. Please carefully review 
the instructions on the VIF for completion and deposit.
These Meeting Materials are being sent to both registered and Non-Registered Holders of Orex Shares. If you 
are a Non-Registered Holder, and Orex or its agent has sent these materials directly to you, your name and 
address  and  information  about  your  holdings  of  securities,  have  been  obtained  in  accordance  with  applicable 
securities regulatory requirements from the Intermediary holding on your behalf.
26
By  choosing  to  send  the  Meeting  Materials  to  NOBOs  directly,  Orex  (and  not  the  Intermediary  holding  on 
your behalf) has assumed responsibility for: (a) delivering these Meeting Materials to you; and (b) executing 
your proper voting instructions.  Please return your voting instructions as specified in the VIF enclosed with 
mailings to NOBOs.
In  addition,  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  NI  54-101,  Orex  is  distributing  copies  of  the 
Meeting Materials to clearing agencies and Intermediaries for onward distribution to OBOs – that is, 
Non-Registered  Holders  who  have  provided  instructions  to  an  Intermediary  that  such  Non-
Registered Holder objects to the Intermediary disclosing ownership information about the beneficial 
owner.
Intermediaries have obligations to forward meeting materials to the Non-Registered Holders, unless 
otherwise  instructed  by  the  holder  (and  as  required  by  regulation  in  some  cases,  despite  such 
instructions).  Generally,  Intermediaries  will  provide  Non-Registered  Holders  with  either:  (a)  a  VIF 
for  completion  and  execution  by  the  Non-Registered  Holder;  or  (b)  a  proxy  form  executed  by  the 
Intermediary and restricted to the number of shares owned by the Non-Registered Holder, but not 
otherwise completed. These are procedures to permit the Non-Registered Holders to direct the voting 
of the Orex Shares which they beneficially own. Intermediaries that are U.S. registered broker-dealers 
will  not  be  permitted  to  exercise  discretionary  voting  authority  and  therefore  if  you  are  an  OBO 
holding Orex Shares in a customer account at a U.S. registered broker-dealer your Orex Shares will 
not be voted or represented at the Meeting unless you execute and return a VIF.
If a Non-Registered Holder wishes to attend and vote at the Meeting in person, he or she must insert 
his or her own name in the space provided for the appointment of a proxyholder on the VIF or proxy 
form provided by the Intermediary and carefully follow the Intermediary's instructions for return of 
the executed form or other method of response.
Voting Securities and Principal Holders of Voting Securities
Orex is authorized to issue an unlimited number of Orex Shares, of which 101,890,199 Orex Shares 
were  issued  and  outstanding  as  of  the  Record  Date.  Orex  has  only  one  class  of  shares.  Each  Orex 
Share will entitle the holder thereof to one vote on the Arrangement Resolution and other resolutions 
being voted on at the Meeting.  In addition, as of the Record Date, there were 6,294,000 Orex Options 
and 14,643,680 Orex Warrants issued and outstanding. For the purposes of the Meeting, each Orex 
Optionholder and Orex Warrantholder whose name is entered on the register of Orex Optionholders

THE MEETING – ANNUAL MATTERS
The following annual and general matters will be voted on at the Meeting only by Orex Shareholders 
or their respective proxyholders:
Financial Statements 
The audited consolidated financial statements and MD&A of Orex for the fiscal year ended April 30, 
2015 will be placed before you at the Meeting.  These financial statements are incorporated into this 
Circular by reference and may be viewed on www.sedar.com under Orex's SEDAR profile.
Election of Directors 
Directors are elected for a term of one year.  The term of office of each of the nominees proposed for 
election as a director will expire at the Meeting, and each of them, if elected, will serve until the close 
of the next annual general meeting, unless he resigns or otherwise vacates office before that time.
Nominees for Election
The following are the nominees proposed for election as directors of Orex together with the number 
of voting securities of Orex that are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, or over which control 
or direction is exercised, by each nominee.  All of the nominees are currently directors of Orex.  Each 
of the nominees has agreed to stand for election and we are not aware of any intention of any of them 
not to do so.  If, however, one or more of them should become unable to stand for election, it is likely 
that one or more other persons would be nominated at the Meeting for election and, in that event, the 
persons designated in the form of proxy will vote in their discretion for a substitute nominee.

Executive Compensation 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Compensation, Philosophy and Objectives
Orex has appointed a Compensation Committee and adopted a Compensation Committee Charter in 
order that the Compensation Committee may guide the compensation program. See Appendix B of 
the  Orex  management  information  circular  dated  September  19,  2014,  which  is  incorporated  by 
reference  in  this  Circular  for  a  full  copy  of  the  Charter.  The  Orex  Board  meets  to  discuss  and 
determine  management  compensation,  upon  recommendation  by  the  Compensation  Committee, 
without reference to formal objectives, criteria or analysis.
The general objectives of Orex's compensation strategy are to:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
compensate management in a manner that encourages and rewards a high level of 
performance  and  outstanding  results  with  a  view  to 
long-term 
shareholder value;
increasing
align management's interests with the long-term interest of shareholders;
provide  a  compensation  package  that  is  commensurate  with  other  junior  mineral 
exploration companies to enable Orex to attract and retain talent;  and
ensure that the total compensation package is designed in a manner that takes into 
account  the  constraints  that  Orex  is  under  by  virtue  of  the  fact  that  it  is  a  natural 
resource company without a history of earnings.
The Orex Board, as a whole, ensures that total compensation paid to all Named Executive Officers (as 
hereinafter defined) is fair and reasonable. The Orex Board relies on the experience of its members as 
officers and directors with other junior mining companies in assessing compensation levels.
The Orex Board considered the risks associated with the current compensation program, but did not 
note any potential material adverse effects. No director or Named Executive Officer is permitted to 
purchase financial instruments that are designed to hedge or offset a decrease in the market value of 
Orex equity securities held directly or indirectly.
Analysis of Elements
Base compensation is used to provide the Named Executive Officers a set amount of money during 
the year with the expectation that each Named Executive Officer will perform his responsibilities to 
the best of his ability and in the best interests of Orex.
Orex  considers  the  granting  of  incentive  stock  options  to  be  a  significant  component  of  executive 
compensation as it allows Orex to reward each Named Executive Officer's efforts to increase value for 
shareholders  without  requiring  Orex  to  use  cash  from  its  treasury.  Stock  options  are  generally 
awarded to directors, officers, consultants and employees periodically at the discretion of the Orex 
Board.  The  terms  and  conditions  of  Orex's  stock  option  grants,  including  vesting  provisions  and 
exercise prices, are governed by the terms of the Orex Option Plan.
30
Long-Term Compensation and Option-Based Awards
Orex  has  no  long-term  incentive  plans  other  than  the  Orex  Option  Plan.  Orex's  directors,  officers, 
employees and consultants are entitled to participate in the Orex Option Plan. The Orex Option Plan 
is designed to encourage share ownership and entrepreneurship on the part of senior management, 
employees  and  other  consultants.  The  Orex  Board  believes  that  the  Orex  Option  Plan  aligns  the 
interests of the Named Executive Officers and the Board with shareholders by linking a component of 
executive compensation to the longer term performance of the Orex Shares.
Orex Options are granted by the Orex Board. In monitoring or adjusting the option allotments, the 
Orex Board takes into account its own observations on individual performance (where possible) and 
its  assessment  of  individual  contribution  to  shareholder  value,  previous  option  grants  and  the 
objectives set for the Named Executive Officers and the Orex Board. In addition to determining the 
number of options to be granted pursuant to the methodology outlined above, the Orex Board also 
makes the following determinations:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
the parties who are entitled to participate in the Orex Option Plan;
the exercise price for each Orex Option granted;
the date on which each Orex Option is granted;
the vesting period, if any, for each Orex Option;
the other material terms and conditions of each Orex Option grant; and
any re-pricing or amendment to a Orex Option grant.
The Orex Board makes these determinations subject to and in accordance with the provisions of the 
Orex Option Plan. The Orex Board reviews and approves grants of Orex Options periodically during 
the financial year.
Pursuant  to  the  Orex  Option  Plan,  the  Orex  Board  grants  Orex  Options  to  directors,  officers, 
employees and consultants as incentives. The level of Orex Options awarded to a Named Executive 
Officer is determined by his or her position and his or her potential future contributions to Orex. The 
exercise price of Orex Options is determined by the Orex Board but, except for options to be issued 
under the Plan of Arrangement, will in no event be less than the closing trading price of the Orex 
Shares on the TSX-V on the day before an Orex Option is granted.
The executive officers and Orex Board refer to the Compensation Committee with respect to setting 
or  amending  any  equity  incentive  plans  under  which  share-based  or  option-based  awards  are 
granted.  The  Compensation  Committee  carries  out  these  responsibilities  in  accordance  with  the 
Compensation Committee Charter.

Pension Plan Benefits
Orex  does  not  have  in  place  any  deferred  compensation  plan  or  pension  plan  that  provides  for 
payments or benefits at, following, or in connection with retirement.
Termination and Change of Control Benefits
Under the terms of the Cope Agreement and the Wilmot Agreement, in the event of death or as a 
result  of  Disability  Termination  (as  defined  in  each  of  the  Cope  Agreement  and  the  Wilmot 
Agreement),  Orex  will  pay  and  provide  Mr.  Cope  or  Mr.  Wilmot,  as  applicable,  or  his  respective
33
estate,  any  accrued  consulting  fees  through  to  the  date  of  termination  and  reimbursement  for  any 
unreimbursed expenses incurred through to the date of death or Disability Termination.
In the event of a Change of Control (as defined in Cope Agreement) where Mr. Cope's employment is 
terminated absent an Event of Default (as defined in the Cope Agreement) in the 12-month period 
following the Change of Control, Mr. Cope is entitled to receive an amount equal to 24 times the sum 
of the most recent 12 month average monthly consulting fee, payable within 30 days of the date of 
termination. In the event of a Change of Control (as defined in the Wilmot Agreement) where Mr. 
Wilmot's employment is terminated absent an Event of Default (as defined in the Wilmot Agreement) 
in the 12-month period following the Change of Control, Mr. Wilmot is entitled to receive an amount 
equal  to  12  times  the  sum  of  the  monthly  consulting  fee,  payable  within  30  days  of  the  date  of 
termination.    If  Orex  terminates  the  Cope  Agreement  or  the  Wilmot  Agreement  other  than  for  an 
Event  of  Default,  Mr.  Cope  or  Mr.  Wilmot,  as  applicable,  may  be  entitled  to  receive  a  lump  sum 
payment equal to 12 months of the applicable consulting fee at Orex's sole discretion.

employment of the officer or from a change in control of Orex or a change of any Named Executive 
Officer's responsibilities following a change in control.
The  only  significant  conditions  of  the  Cope  Agreement  and  the  Wilmot  Agreement  that  applies  to 
receiving  payments  or  benefits  is  the  enduring  confidentiality  clause  regarding  confidential 
information, as defined in each respective agreement. The provision for breach of the clause is subject 
to the Laws of British Columbia and Canada applicable thereto. There are no other significant factors.

Orex  for  their  services  as  directors,  for  committee  participation,  or  for  involvement  in  special 
assignments during the most recently completed financial year except for the granting from time to 
time of Orex Options in accordance with the policies of the TSX-V. None of Orex's directors received

Arrangement  Resolution  to  approve  the  Arrangement  under  the  Business  Corporations  Act.    The 
Arrangement,  the  Plan  of  Arrangement  and  the  terms  of  the  Arrangement  Agreement  are 
summarized below. This summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by

least two-thirds of the votes cast by Orex Shareholders and Orex Optionholders present in person or 
represented by proxy at the Meeting, voting together as a single class, on the basis of one vote per 
Orex  Share  and  with  each  Orex  Optionholder  being  entitled  to  that  number  of  votes  equal  to  the 
number  of  Orex  Shares  that  such  holder  would  be  entitled  to  receive  upon  exercise  of  the  Orex 
Options held by such holder as of the Record Date; and (ii) at least two-thirds of the votes cast by 
Orex Warrantholders present in person or represented by proxy at the Meeting, voting as a single

Orex Shares that such holder would be entitled to receive upon exercise of the Orex Warrants held by 
such holder as of the Record Date. A copy of the Arrangement Resolution is set out in Appendix A of 
this Circular.
Unless otherwise directed, it is management's intention to vote FOR the Arrangement Resolution. If 
you do  not specify  how you want your Orex Securities voted, the persons  named as proxyholders 
will cast the votes represented by your proxy at the Meeting FOR the Arrangement Resolution.
If the Arrangement is approved at the Meeting and the Final Order approving the Arrangement is 
issued by the Court and the applicable conditions to the completion of the Arrangement are satisfied 
or  waived,  the  Arrangement  will  take  effect  at  the  Effective  Time  (which  will  be  at  12:01  a.m. 
(Vancouver time)) on the Effective Date (which is expected to be on or about September 25, 2015).
Principal Steps of the Arrangement
Pursuant  to  the  Plan  of  Arrangement,  commencing  at  the  Effective  Time,  the  following  principal 
steps  will  occur  and  will  be  deemed  to  occur  in  the  following  order  without  any  further  act  or 
formality:
Dissent Securities
(a)
all Dissent Securities held by Dissenting Securityholders will be deemed to have been 
transferred to Orex and each Dissenting Securityholder will cease to have any right 
as an Orex Securityholder other than a right to be paid by Orex the fair value for such 
Dissent Securities.
Alteration of Capital of Orex and Exchange of Orex Shares for New Common Shares and Spinco Shares
(b)
the share capital of Orex will be reorganized such that:
(i)
the authorized share capital will be amended to:
(A)
(B)
change the identifying name of the Orex Shares from "Common" to 
"Class A Common" shares and the special rights and restrictions set 
out  in  Appendix  A  to  the  Plan  of  Arrangement  will  attach  to  such 
Orex Shares, and
create  a  new  class  of  shares  consisting  of  an  unlimited  number  of 
New  Common  Shares,  being  shares  without  par  value,  the 
identifying name of which will be "Common" shares,
and Orex's articles and notice of articles will be altered accordingly;
37
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
each outstanding Orex Share will be exchanged for one New Common Share 
and one Spinco Share and such Orex Share will be cancelled;

the stated capital of Orex for the outstanding New Common Shares will be 
an  amount  equal  to  the  paid-up  capital  for  the  purpose  of  the  Tax  Act  of 
Orex for the Orex Shares, less the amount determined by the Orex Board as 
being the fair value of the Spinco Shares distributed on such exchange.
Arrangement of Orex Options
(c)
in respect of the Orex Options:
(i)
each Orex Option outstanding immediately before the Effective Time will be 
and will be deemed to be exchanged for:

terms of the New Orex Option Plan and will have an exercise price 
per  New  Common  Share  (rounded  up  to  the  nearest  whole  cent) 
equal  to  the  exercise  price  of  each  Orex  Option  so  exchanged 
multiplied by the Valuation Factor; and
one fully-vested Spinco Option to purchase from Spinco one Spinco 
Share.  Each  Spinco  Option  will  be  governed  by  the  terms  of  the 
Spinco Option Plan and will have an exercise price per Spinco Share 
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price of 
each  Orex  Option  so  exchanged  multiplied  by  a  number  which  is 
equal to one (1) minus the Valuation Factor;
(ii)
(iii)
the  Orex  Option  Plan  will  be  terminated,  and  neither  Orex  nor  any  Orex 
Optionholder will have any liabilities or obligations with respect to the Orex 
Option Plan, any Orex Option or any such agreements made in connection 
therewith; and
the  respective  option  registers  of  Orex  and  Spinco  will  be  deemed  to  be 
amended accordingly.
Arrangement of Orex Warrants
(d)
in respect of the Orex Warrants:
(i)
each Orex Warrant outstanding immediately before  the Effective Time  will 
be and will be deemed to be exchanged for:
(A)
one  New  Orex  Warrant  to  purchase  from  Orex  one  New  Common 
Share. Each New Orex Warrant will be governed by the terms of the 
New  Orex  Warrant  Certificates  and  will  have  an  exercise  price  per
38
New Common Share equal to the exercise price of the Orex Warrant 
for which such New Orex Warrant was exchanged; and
(B)
one Spinco Warrant to purchase from Spinco one Spinco Share. Each 
Spinco Warrant will be governed by the terms of the Spinco Warrant 
Certificates and will have an exercise price per Spinco Share equal to 
the  exercise  price  of  the  Orex  Warrant  for  which  such  Spinco 
Warrant was exchanged;
(ii)
as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Orex will deliver to each Orex 
Warrantholder a New Orex Warrant Certificate in respect of the New Orex 
Warrants  and  Spinco  will  deliver  to  each  Orex  Warrantholder  a  Spinco 
Warrant  Certificate  in  respect  of  the  Spinco  Warrants  and  thereupon  the 
Orex Warrant Certificates representing the Orex Warrant so exchanged will 
be terminated, and neither Orex nor any Orex Warrantholder will have any 
liabilities or obligations with respect to the Orex Warrant Certificates or any 
other agreements made in connection therewith; and
(iii)
the  respective  warrant  registers  of  Orex  and  Spinco  will  be  deemed  to  be 
amended accordingly.
Background to the Arrangement
As announced originally by news release on February 1, 2013, the management of Orex and the Orex 
Board have been investigating the process and advisability of creating Spinco and transferring Orex's 
interest in the Barsele Project to Spinco for over two years. The Arrangement was postponed since the 
spring of 2013 due to market conditions, but as a result of the closing of the Gunnarn JV on June 11, 
2015,  Orex  obtained  the  necessary  financing  to  complete  the  Arrangement.  Management  of  Orex 
believes that there is potentially greater value that could be recognized in Orex's 45% interest in the 
Barsele Project and Orex's 100% interest in the Orex Projects if those interests were held and operated 
separately, rather than continuing to be held solely by Orex, and as a result, has decided to proceed 
with  the  Arrangement  in  order  to  meet  the  objectives  set  out  under  the  heading  "Reasons  for  the 
Arrangement" below.
Reasons for the Arrangement
The Orex Board has reviewed and considered a significant amount of information and considered a 
number  of  factors  relating  to  the  Arrangement  with  the  benefit  of  advice  from  Orex's  senior 
management  and  its  financial,  legal  and  technical  advisors.    The  following  is  a  summary  of  the 
principal reasons for the unanimous recommendation of the Orex Board that Orex  Securityholders 
vote FOR the Arrangement Resolution:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
Separation  of  Assets.  The  separation  of  Orex's  assets  will  enable  management  to  advance 
Orex's mineral projects in a more focused and efficient manner.
Continued  Participation  by  Orex  Shareholders  in  the  Barsele  Project  Through  Spinco.  Orex 
Shareholders,  through  their  ownership  of  all  of  the  issued  and  outstanding  Spinco  Shares, 
will  continue  to  participate  in  the  value  associated  with  the  exploration,  development  and 
operation of the Barsele Project.
Continued Participation by Orex Shareholders in all of Orex's Other Projects. Orex Shareholders, 
through  their  ownership  of  all  of  the  issued  and  outstanding  New  Common  Shares,  will
39
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
continue  to  participate  in  the  value  associated  with  the  exploration,  development  and 
operation of all of the Orex Projects.
Continuity of Management. The board of directors and officers of each of Orex and Spinco after 
the Arrangement will initially be the same directors and officers that currently manage Orex, 
preserving  the  management  know-how  and  direction  of  Orex  for  the  benefit  of  both 
companies.
Approval  of  Orex  Securityholders  and  the  Court  are  Required.  The  Arrangement  must  be 
approved by: (i) at least two-thirds of the votes cast in respect of the Arrangement Resolution 
by Orex Shareholders and Orex Optionholders present in person or represented by proxy at 
the Meeting, voting together as a single class, on the basis of one vote per Orex Share and 
with each Orex Optionholder being entitled to that number of votes equal to the number of 
Orex Shares that such holder would be entitled to receive upon exercise of the Orex Options 
held  by  such  holder  as  of  the  Record  Date;  and (ii)  at  least  two-thirds  of  the  votes  cast  by 
Orex Warrantholders present in person or represented by proxy at the Meeting, voting as a 
single class, with each Orex Warrantholder being entitled to that number of votes equal to the 
number  of  Orex  Shares  that  such  holder  would be  entitled  to  receive  upon  exercise  of  the 
Orex  Warrants  held  by  such  holder  as  of  the  Record  Date.  The  Arrangement  must  also  be 
sanctioned  by  the  Court,  which  will  consider  the  fairness  of  the  Arrangement  to  Orex 
Securityholders.
Dissent Rights. Orex Securityholders who oppose the Arrangement may, on strict compliance 
with certain conditions, exercise their Dissent Rights and receive the fair value of the Dissent 
Securities in accordance with the Arrangement.
In view of the wide variety of factors and information considered in connection with their evaluation 
of the Arrangement, the Orex Board did not find it practicable to, and therefore did not, quantify or 
otherwise  attempt  to  assign  any  relative  weight  to  each  specific  factor  or  item  of  information 
considered in reaching their conclusions and recommendations. In addition, individual members of 
the Orex Board may have given different weights to different factors or items of information.
Recommendation of the Orex Board
After  careful  consideration  of,  among  other  things,  the  factors  described  under  the  heading  "The 
Meeting  –  The  Arrangement  —  Reasons  for  the  Arrangement",  the  Orex  Board  has  unanimously 
determined that the Plan of Arrangement is fair to Orex Securityholders and is in the best interests of 
Orex. Accordingly, the Orex Board unanimously recommends that Orex Securityholders vote FOR 
the Arrangement Resolution.
Each  director  of  Orex  intends  to  vote  all  of  his  Orex  Securities  in  favor  of  the  Arrangement 
Resolution, subject to the terms of the Arrangement Agreement.
Orex Option Plan and Treatment of Orex Options
Pursuant to the Arrangement, each Orex Option outstanding immediately before the Effective Time 
will  be  exchanged  for:  (a)  one  fully-vested  New  Orex  Option  to  purchase  from  Orex  one  New 
Common Share; and (b) one fully-vested Spinco Option to purchase from Spinco one Spinco Share. 
Each New Orex Option will be governed by the terms of the New Orex Option Plan, will have an 
exercise price per New Common Share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise 
price of each Orex Option so exchanged multiplied by the Valuation Factor and will have an expiry 
date equivalent to the respective expiry date of each Orex Option so exchanged. Each Spinco Option
40
will be governed by the terms of the Spinco Option Plan, will have an exercise price per Spinco Share 
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price of each Orex Option so exchanged 
multiplied by a number which is equal to one (1) minus the Valuation Factor and will have an expiry 
date equivalent to the respective expiry date of each Orex Option so exchanged.
Upon completion of the Arrangement, the Orex Option Plan will be terminated, and neither Orex nor 
any Orex Optionholder will have any liability or obligation with respect to the Orex Option Plan, any 
Orex  Option,  or  any  such  agreements  made  in  connection  with  the  Orex  Option  Plan  or  the  Orex 
Options.
Orex Optionholders who do not want to receive New Orex Options and Spinco Options in exchange 
for  their  Orex  Options  may  exercise  their  vested  Orex  Options  before  the  Effective  Time,  in 
accordance with the terms of the Orex Option Plan, and participate in the Arrangement on the same 
basis as Orex Shareholders.
Treatment of Orex Warrants
Pursuant  to  the  Arrangement,  each  warrant  certificate  representing  an  Orex  Warrant  outstanding 
immediately before the Effective Time will be exchanged for: (a) one New Orex Warrant to purchase 
from Orex one New Common Share; and (b) one Spinco Warrant to purchase from Spinco one Spinco 
Share. Each New Orex Warrant will be governed by the terms of the New Orex Warrant Certificates, 
will have an exercise price per New Common Share equal to the exercise price of the Orex Warrant 
for  which  such  New  Orex  Warrant  was  exchanged  and  will  have  an  expiry  date  equivalent  to  the 
respective expiry date of each Orex Warrant so exchanged. Each Spinco Warrant will be governed by 
the terms of the Spinco Warrant Certificates, will have an exercise price per Spinco Share equal to the 
exercise price of the Orex Warrant for which such Spinco Warrant was exchanged and will have an 
expiry date equivalent to the respective expiry date of each Orex Warrant so exchanged.
Upon completion of the Arrangement, the Orex Warrant Certificates will be terminated, and neither 
Orex  nor  any  Orex  Warrantholder  will  have  any  liability  or  obligation  with  respect  to  the  Orex 
Warrant Certificates, any Orex Warrant or any other agreements made in connection with the Orex 
Warrant Certificates or Orex Warrants.
Orex  Warrantholders  who  do  not  want  to  receive  New  Orex  Warrants  and  Spinco  Warrants  in 
exchange  for  their  Orex  Warrants  can  exercise  their  Orex  Warrants  before  the  Effective  Time,  in 
accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  respective  Orex  Warrant  Certificates,  and  participate  in  the 
Arrangement on the same basis as Orex Shareholders.
Approval of the Arrangement Resolution
At the Meeting, the Orex Securityholders will be asked to approve the Arrangement Resolution, the 
full text of which is set out in Appendix A to this Circular. In order for the Arrangement to become 
effective, as provided in the Interim Order and by the Business Corporations Act, the Arrangement 
Resolution must be approved by: (i) at least two-thirds of the votes cast by Orex Shareholders and 
Orex Optionholders present in person or represented by proxy at the Meeting, voting together as a 
single class, on the basis of one vote per Orex Share and with each Orex Optionholder being entitled 
to that number  of votes equal to the  number of Orex Shares that such  holder  would be entitled to 
receive upon exercise of the Orex Options held by such holder as of the Record Date; and (ii) at least 
two-thirds of the votes cast by Orex Warrantholders present in person or represented by proxy at the 
Meeting,  voting  as  a  single  class,  with  each  Orex  Warrantholder  being  entitled  to  that  number  of 
votes equal to the number of Orex Shares that such holder would be entitled to receive upon exercise 
of the Orex Warrants held by such holder as of the Record Date.  Should Orex Securityholders fail to
41
approve  the  Arrangement  Resolution  by  the  requisite  majorities,  the  Arrangement  will  not  be 
completed.
The  Orex  Board  has  approved  the  terms  of  the  Arrangement  Agreement  and  the  Plan  of 
Arrangement  and  recommends  that  the  Orex  Securityholders  vote  FOR  the  Arrangement 
Resolution. See "The Meeting – The Arrangement — Recommendation of the Orex Board" above.
Completion of the Arrangement
The Arrangement will become effective at 12:01 a.m. on the date following the date upon which all of 
the  conditions  to  completion  of  the  Arrangement  as  set  out  in  Section  2.9  of  the  Arrangement 
Agreement  have  been  satisfied  or  waived  in  accordance  with  the  Arrangement  Agreement,  all 
documents agreed to be delivered thereunder have been delivered to the satisfaction of the recipient, 
acting reasonably, and the filings required under Section 292 of the Business Corporations Act have 
been  filed  with  the  Registrar.    Completion  of  the  Arrangement  is  expected  to  occur  on  or  about 
September 25, 2015; however, it is possible that completion may be delayed beyond this date if the 
conditions to completion of the Arrangement cannot be met on a timely basis.
Procedure for Exchange of Orex Shares
At  the  time  of  sending  this  Circular  to  each  Orex  Securityholder,  Orex  is  also  sending  to  each 
Registered  Orex  Shareholder  the  Letter  of  Transmittal.    The  Letter  of  Transmittal  is  for  use  by 
Registered Orex Shareholders only and is not to be used by Non-Registered Holders. Non-Registered 
Holders should contact their broker or other intermediary for instructions and assistance in receiving 
the New Common Shares and Spinco Shares in respect of their Orex Shares. Non-Registered Holders 
must instruct their brokers or other Intermediaries promptly in order to receive the consideration to 
which they are entitled under the Arrangement as soon as possible after the Effective Date.
In order to receive a share certificate or DRS Advice Statement representing New Common Shares 
and Spinco Shares, a Registered Orex Shareholder must complete, sign, date and return the enclosed 
Letter of Transmittal and all documents required thereby in accordance with the instructions set out 
therein.  Registered Orex Shareholders can request additional copies of the Letter of Transmittal by 
contacting the Depositary. The Letter of Transmittal is also available under Orex's profile on SEDAR 
at www.sedar.com.
The Letter of Transmittal contains procedural information relating to the Arrangement and should be 
reviewed carefully.
Orex and Spinco reserve the right to waive or not to waive any and all errors or other deficiencies in 
any  Letter  of  Transmittal  or  other  document  and  any  such  waiver  or  non-waiver  will  be  binding 
upon the affected Orex Shareholder. The granting of a waiver to one or more Orex Shareholders does 
not constitute a waiver for any other Orex Shareholder. Orex and Spinco reserve the right to demand 
strict compliance with the terms of the Letter of Transmittal and the Arrangement. The method used 
to deliver the Letter of Transmittal and any accompanying certificate(s) representing Orex Shares is at 
the option and risk of the holder surrendering them, and delivery will be deemed effective only when 
such  documents  are  actually  received  by  the  Depositary.  Orex  recommends  that  the  necessary 
documentation be hand delivered to the Depositary, and a receipt obtained therefor; otherwise the 
use  of  registered  mail  with  return  receipt  requested,  and  with  proper  insurance  obtained,  is 
recommended.
42
If you have any questions relating to the Arrangement or the deposit of Orex Shares, please contact 
the  Depositary  by  telephone  toll-free  in  North  America  at  1-888-249-7775  or  outside  of  North 
America, collect at 1-416-263-9524, or by e-mail to service@computershare.com.
Registered  Orex  Shareholders  are  requested  to  tender  to  the  Depositary  any  share  certificate(s) 
representing  their  Orex  Shares,  along  with  a  duly  completed  Letter  of  Transmittal.  The  Letter  of 
Transmittal is for use by Registered Orex Shareholders only and is not to be used by Non-Registered 
Holders.
Before the Effective Date, Orex and Spinco will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Depositary 
treasury  directions  directing  the  Depositary  to  deliver  sufficient  certificates  and  DRS  Advice 
Statements  representing  the  New  Common  Shares  and  Spinco  Shares  required  to  be  issued  to  the 
Orex  Shareholders  under  the  Arrangement  (other  than  payments  to  Orex  Shareholders  exercising 
their Dissent Rights) to be held by the Depositary as agent and nominee for such Orex Shareholders.
As soon as practicable after the Effective Date, provided a Former Orex Shareholder submitted to the 
Depositary, before the Effective Date, an effective Letter of Transmittal, together with the certificate 
representing  the  Orex  Shares  (if  any)  held  by  such  Former  Orex  Shareholder  and  such  other 
documents as the Depositary may require the share certificate or DRS Advice Statement representing 
the New Common Shares and the share certificate or DRS Advice Statement representing the Spinco 
Shares  to  which  the  Registered  Orex  Shareholder  is  entitled  pursuant  to  the  Arrangement  will  be 
either: (a) delivered to the address or addresses as the Registered Orex Shareholder directed in their 
Letter  of  Transmittal;  (b) made  available  for  pick-up  at  the  offices  of  the  Depositary  in  accordance 
with  the  instructions  of  the  Registered  Orex  Shareholder  in  the  Letter  of  Transmittal;  or  (c)  if  the 
Letter of Transmittal neither specifies an address nor contains instructions for pick-up, forwarded to 
the  Registered  Orex  Shareholder  at  the  address  of  such  holder  as  shown  on  the  central  securities 
register of Orex.
A  Registered  Orex  Shareholder  that  does  not  submit  an  effective  Letter  of  Transmittal  before  the 
Effective Date may take delivery of the share certificate or DRS Advice Statement representing the 
New Common Shares and share certificate or DRS Advice Statement representing the Spinco Shares 
to which the Registered Orex Shareholder is entitled pursuant to the Arrangement by delivering the 
share  certificate  (if  any)  representing  Orex  Shares  formerly  held  by  such  shareholder  to  the 
Depositary at the office indicated in the Letter of Transmittal at any time before the sixth anniversary 
of the Effective Date.  Such share certificate (if any) must be accompanied by a duly completed Letter 
of  Transmittal,  together  with  such  other  documents  as  the  Depositary  may  require.  The  share 
certificate or DRS Advice Statement representing the New Common Shares and the share certificate 
or DRS Advice Statement representing the Spinco Shares to which the Registered Orex Shareholder is 
entitled pursuant to the Arrangement will be either: (a) delivered to the address or addresses as the 
Registered Orex Shareholder directed in their Letter of Transmittal; (b) made available for pick-up at 
the offices of the Depositary in accordance with the instructions of the Registered Orex Shareholder 
in the Letter of Transmittal; or (c) if the Letter of Transmittal neither specifies an address nor contains 
instructions for pick-up, forwarded to the Registered Orex Shareholder at the address of such holder 
as shown on the central securities register of Orex.
Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  the  instructions  to  the  Letter  of  Transmittal,  the  signature  on  the 
Letter  of  Transmittal  must  be  guaranteed  by  an  Eligible  Institution.  If  a  Letter  of  Transmittal  is 
executed  by  a  person  other  than  the  registered  holder  of  the  share  certificate(s)  (if  any)  deposited 
therewith,  the  share  certificate(s)  (if  any)  must  be  endorsed  or  be  accompanied  by  an  appropriate 
securities transfer power of attorney, duly and properly completed by the registered holder, with the 
signature  on  the  endorsement  panel,  or  securities  transfer  power  of  attorney  guaranteed  by  an 
Eligible Institution.
43
Lost Certificates
If any certificate which, immediately before the Effective Time, represented one or more outstanding 
Orex  Shares  has  been  lost,  stolen  or  destroyed,  upon  the  making  of  an  affidavit  or  statutory 
declaration of that fact by the Registered Orex Shareholder claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen 
or  destroyed  and  who  was  listed  immediately  before  the  Effective  Time  as  the  registered  holder 
thereof on the central securities register of Orex, the Depositary will deliver to such Registered Orex 
Shareholder, the certificate or DRS Advice Statement representing the New Common Shares and the 
certificate or DRS Advice Statement representing the Spinco Shares to which such Registered Orex 
Shareholder  is  entitled  to  receive  in  exchange  for  such  lost,  stolen  or  destroyed  certificate.  When 
authorizing  such  delivery  in  exchange  for  such  lost,  stolen  or  destroyed  certificate,  the  Registered 
Orex Shareholder to whom the New Common Shares and Spinco Shares are to be issued, distributed 
and  exchanged,  as  applicable,  must,  as  a  condition  precedent  to  the  delivery  thereof,  give  a  bond 
satisfactory to Orex, Spinco and the Depositary, in such sum as Orex, Spinco or the Depositary may 
direct,  or  otherwise  indemnify  Orex  ,  Spinco  and  the  Depositary  in  a  manner  satisfactory  to  Orex, 
Spinco  and  the  Depositary  against  any  claim  that  may  be  made  against  Orex,  Spinco  and  the 
Depositary with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
Procedure for Exchange of Orex Options
In order to receive New Orex Options and Spinco Options, as soon as practicable after the Effective 
Time  each  Orex  Optionholder  must  deliver  to  Orex  at  its  head  office  the  agreement(s),  if  any, 
representing such holder's Orex Options and any other documentation required by Orex and Spinco.
As soon as practicable after receipt of such agreement(s), Orex and Spinco will deliver to each Orex 
Optionholder  agreements  representing  the  New  Orex  Options  and  Spinco  Options,  respectively, 
which such Orex Optionholder is entitled to receive under the Arrangement.
Orex Optionholders who do not wish to receive New Orex Options and Spinco Options in exchange 
for  their  Orex  Options  can  exercise  their  Orex  Options  and  participate  in  the  Arrangement  on  the 
same basis as Orex Shareholders.
Orex  recommends  that  any  Orex  Optionholders  who  wish  to  exercise  their  Orex  Options  for  Orex 
Shares prior to the Arrangement should exercise such Orex Options by 5:00 p.m. (Vancouver time) on 
September  21,  2015,  or,  if  the  Meeting  is  adjourned  or  postponed,  two  Business  Days  before  the 
reconvened Meeting.
Procedure for Exchange of Orex Warrants
In order to receive New Orex Warrants and Spinco Warrants, as soon as practicable after the Effective 
Time  each  Orex  Warrantholder  must  deliver  to  Orex  at  its  head  office  the  certificate(s),  if  any, 
representing  such  holder's  Orex  Warrants  and  any  other  documentation  required  by  Orex  and 
Spinco.
As soon as practicable after receipt of such certificate(s), Orex and Spinco will deliver to each Orex 
Warrantholder certificates representing the New Orex Warrants and Spinco Warrants, respectively, 
which such Orex Warrantholder is entitled to receive under the Arrangement.
Orex  Warrantholders  who  do  not  wish  to  receive  New  Orex  Warrants  and  Spinco  Warrants  in 
exchange  for  their  Orex  Warrants  can  exercise  their  Orex  Warrants  and  participate  in  the 
Arrangement on the same basis as Orex Shareholders.
44
Orex recommends that any Orex Warrantholders who wish to exercise their Orex Warrants for Orex 
Shares prior to the Arrangement should exercise such Orex Warrants by 5:00 p.m. (Vancouver time) 
on September 21, 2015, or, if the Meeting is adjourned or postponed, two Business Days before the 
reconvened Meeting.
Treatment of Dividends
No  dividend  or  other  distribution  declared  or  made  after  the  Effective  Time  with  respect  to  New 
Common Shares or Spinco Shares with a record date after the Effective Time will be delivered to the 
holder  of  any  unsurrendered  certificate  (if  any)  that,  immediately  before  the  Effective  Time, 
represented  outstanding  Orex  Shares  unless  and  until  the  holder  of  such  certificate  will  have 
complied  with  the  requirement  to  deliver  such  certificate,  along  with  a  duly  completed  Letter  of 
Transmittal,  to  the  Depositary,  or  if  such  certificate  has  been  lost,  stolen  or  destroyed  will  have 
completed  the  deliveries  and  provided  the  bond  or  indemnities  described  above.  Subject  to 
applicable Law and the provisions of the Plan of Arrangement relating to the withholding of taxes 
where  required,  at  the  time  of  such  compliance,  there  will,  in  addition  to  the  delivery  of  the 
certificates  or  DRS  Advice  Statements  representing  New  Common  Shares  and  Spinco  Shares,  be 
delivered to such holder, without interest, the amount of the dividend or other distribution with a 
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such  New  Common Shares or 
Spinco Shares.
Cancellation of Rights after Six Years
Any  certificate  which  immediately  before  the  Effective  Time  represented  outstanding  Orex  Shares 
and  which  has  not  been  surrendered,  with  a  duly  completed  Letter  of  Transmittal  and  all  other 
documents required by the Depositary, on or before the date that is six years after the Effective Date, 
will  cease  to  represent  any  claim  for  New  Common  Shares  or  Spinco  Shares  or  any  other  claim 
against or interest of any kind or nature in Orex or Spinco. Accordingly, Former Orex Shareholders 
who do not deposit with the Depositary a duly completed Letter of Transmittal and certificate(s) 
(if any) representing their Orex Shares on or before the date that is six years after the Effective 
Date  will  not  receive  New  Common  Shares  or  Spinco  Shares  or  any  other  consideration  in 
exchange  therefor  and  will  not  own  any  interest  in  Orex  or  Spinco  and  such  Former  Orex 
Shareholders will not be paid any other compensation.
Effects of the Arrangement on Orex Shareholder's Rights
Orex Shareholders receiving New Common Shares and Spinco Shares under the Arrangement will 
continue to be shareholders of Orex after the Arrangement and will become shareholders of Spinco. 
Spinco, like Orex, is a British Columbia company governed by the Business Corporations Act. Orex 
will continue to be a British Columbia company governed by the Business Corporations Act.
Court Approval of the Arrangement
An Arrangement under the Business Corporations Act requires approval of the Court.
Interim Order
On August 21, 2015, Orex obtained the Interim  Order providing for the calling and holding  of the 
Meeting, the Dissent Rights and certain other procedural matters. The text of the Interim Order is set 
out in Appendix D to this Circular.
45
Final Order
Subject to the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, and if the Arrangement Resolution is approved 
by Orex Securityholders at the Meeting in the manner required by the Interim Order, Orex intends to 
make an application to the Court for the Final Order.
The application for the Final Order approving the Arrangement is currently scheduled for September 
24,  2015  at  9:45  a.m.  (Vancouver  time),  or  as  soon  thereafter  as  counsel  may  be  heard,  at  the 
Courthouse,  800  Smithe  Street,  Vancouver,  British  Columbia,  or  at  any  other  date  and  time  as  the 
Court may direct. Any Orex Securityholder who wishes to appear or be represented and to present 
evidence or arguments at that hearing must file and serve a response to petition no later than 5:00 
p.m. (Vancouver time) on September 21, 2015 along with any other documents required, all as set out 
in the Interim Order and Notice of Hearing of Petition for Final Order, the texts of which are set out 
in Appendix D to this Circular, and satisfy any other requirements of the Court.  Such Persons should 
consult with their legal advisors as to the necessary requirements. If the hearing is adjourned then, 
subject  to  further  order  of  the  Court,  only  those  Persons  having  previously  filed  and  served  a 
response to petition will be given notice of the adjournment.
Orex has been advised by its legal counsel, Stikeman Elliott LLP, that the Court has broad discretion 
under the Business Corporations Act when making orders with respect to the Arrangement and that 
the  Court  will  consider,  among  other  things,  the  fairness  and  reasonableness  of  the  Arrangement, 
both from a substantive and a procedural point of view. The Court may approve the Arrangement, 
either  as  proposed  or  as  amended,  on  the  terms  presented  or  substantially  on  those  terms.  
Depending upon the nature of any required amendments, Orex may determine not to proceed with 
the Arrangement.
The New Common Shares, Spinco Shares, New Orex Options, Spinco Options, New Orex Warrants 
and Spinco Warrants to be issued, distributed and exchanged, as applicable, to Orex Securityholders, 
as applicable, pursuant to the Arrangement have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. 
Securities Act or the applicable Securities Laws of any state of the United States and will be issued, 
distributed and exchanged, as applicable, in reliance upon the Section 3(a)(10) Exemption of the U.S. 
Securities  Act  and  exemptions  provided  under  the  applicable  Securities  Laws  of  each  state  of  the 
United States in which Orex Securityholders reside. Section 3(a)(10) of the U.S. Securities Act exempts 
from registration a security that is issued or distributed in exchange for outstanding securities, claims 
or property interests, where the terms and conditions of such issuance and exchange are approved, 
after  a  hearing  upon  the  fairness  of  such  terms  and  conditions  at  which  all  Persons  to  whom  it  is 
proposed  to  issue  securities  in  such  exchange  have  the  right  to  appear,  by  a  court  or  by  a 
governmental  authority  expressly  authorized  by  law  to  grant  such  approval  and  to  hold  such  a 
hearing.  The New Common Shares and Spinco Shares issuable upon the exercise of the New Orex 
Options,  Spinco  Options,  New  Orex  Warrants  and  Spinco  Warrants,  as  applicable,  in  the  United 
States or by, or on behalf of, a U.S. Person after the Effective Date may not be issued in reliance upon 
Section 3(a)(10) of the U.S. Securities Act and may be exercised only if the issuance is registered under 
the U.S. Securities Act  or  exempt from  the registration requirements  of the U.S. Securities Act and 
pursuant  to  any  applicable  Securities  Laws  of  any  state  of  the  United  States.    The  Court  will  be 
advised at the hearing of the application for the Final Order that if the terms and conditions of the 
Arrangement, and the fairness thereof, are approved by the Court, the Final Order will be relied upon 
to constitute the basis for the Section 3(a)(10) Exemption with respect to the New Common Shares, 
Spinco Shares, New Orex Options, Spinco Options, New Orex Warrants and Spinco Warrants to be 
issued,  distributed  and  exchanged,  as  applicable,  pursuant  to  the  Arrangement.    Accordingly,  the 
Final Order of the Court will, if granted, constitute  a basis for the exemption from the registration 
requirements  of  the  U.S.  Securities  Act  with  respect  to  the  issuance  of  the  New  Common  Shares, 
Spinco  Shares,  New  Orex  Options,  Spinco  Options,  New  Orex  Warrants  and  Spinco  Warrants  in
46
connection with the Arrangement.  See "The Meeting – The Arrangement – Regulatory Law Matters and 
Securities Law Matters – United States Securities Law Matters".
For  further  information  regarding  the  Court  hearing  and  your  rights  in  connection  with  the  Court 
hearing,  see  the  form  of  Notice  of  Petition  attached  at  Appendix  D  to  this  Circular.  The  Notice  of 
Petition constitutes notice of the Court hearing of the application for the Final Order and is your only 
notice of the Court hearing.
Regulatory Approvals
The Orex Shares are listed and posted for trading on the TSX-V. After the Effective Date, the Orex 
Shares will be delisted from the TSX-V and the New Common Shares will be listed and posted for 
trading on the TSX-V, and are expected to commence trading on the TSX-V within 3 Business Days of 
the Effective Date. The TSX-V has conditionally approved the listing of the New Common Shares to 
be issued under the Arrangement and issuable on the exercise of the New Orex Options and New 
Orex Warrants after completion of the Arrangement, subject to filing certain documents following the 
closing of the Arrangement.
Spinco  has  applied  for  the  listing  of  the  Spinco  Shares  to  be  issued  in  connection  with  the 
Arrangement  and  those  issuable  on  the  exercise  of  the  Spinco  Options  and  Spinco  Warrants  after 
completion of the Arrangement. Any listing of Spinco and the Spinco Shares will be subject to Spinco 
meeting the initial listing requirements of the TSX-V. There can be no assurance as to if, or when, the 
Spinco Shares will be listed or traded on the TSX-V or any other stock exchange. As the Spinco Shares 
are not listed on a stock exchange, unless and until such a listing is obtained, holders of Spinco Shares 
may not have a market for their shares.
TSX-V Requirements, Regulatory Law and Securities Law Matters
Other  than  the  Final  Order  and  the  approvals  of  the  TSX-V,  Orex  is  not  aware  of  any  material 
approval,  consent  or  other  action  by  any  federal,  provincial,  state  or  foreign  government  or  any 
administrative or regulatory agency that would be required to be obtained in order to complete the 
Arrangement. In the event that any such approvals or consents are determined to be required, such 
approvals  or  consents  will  be  sought,  although  any  such  additional  requirements  could  delay  the 
Effective Date or prevent the completion of the Arrangement. While there can be no assurance that 
any  regulatory  consents  or  approvals  that  are  determined  to  be  required  will  be  obtained,  Orex 
currently anticipates that any such consents and approvals that are determined to be required will 
have been obtained or otherwise resolved by the Effective Date, which, subject to receipt of the Orex 
Securityholder Approval at the Meeting, receipt of the Final Order and the satisfaction or waiver of 
all  other  conditions  specified  in  the  Arrangement  Agreement,  is  expected  to  be  on  or  about 
September 25, 2015.
TSX-V Requirements – Valuation Report
Pursuant  to  the  policies  of  the  TSX-V,  Orex  is  required  to  provide  the  Valuation  Report  in  this 
Circular, in order to, among other things: (i) specify the value of Orex immediately after the Effective 
Time; and (ii) specify the value of Spinco when the Spinco Shares begin trading on the TSX-V, and in 
particular,  the  specific  value  of  all  of  the  assets  being  spun-out  to  Spinco,  in  determining  the 
Valuation Factor.
Pursuant to the Valuation Report, the Valuation Factor was set at 0.60 based on the value of Orex and 
Spinco  immediately  after  the  Effective  Time  being  approximately  $23.6  million  and  $15.5  million,
47
respectively. The full text of the Valuation Report is attached as Appendix  C to this Circular. Orex 
Shareholders should read the Valuation Report in its entirety.
Subject to the terms of its engagement, Glanville and McKnight have consented to the inclusion in 
this Circular of the Valuation Report in its entirety, together with the summary herein.
Canadian Securities Laws Matters
Each  Orex  Shareholder  is  urged  to  consult  such  Orex  Shareholder's  professional  advisors  to 
determine the Canadian conditions and restrictions applicable to trades in the New Common Shares 
or Spinco Shares.
Status Under Canadian Securities Laws
Orex  is  a  reporting  issuer  in  British  Columbia,  Alberta,  Saskatchewan,  Manitoba  and  Ontario.  The 
Orex Shares currently trade on the TSX-V. After the Effective Time, the Orex Shares will be delisted 
from  the  TSX-V  and  the  New  Common  Shares  issuable  pursuant  to  and  in  connection  with  the 
Arrangement are expected to commence trading on the TSX-V within 3 Business Days of the Effective 
Date.
Upon  completion  of  the  Arrangement,  Spinco  expects  that  it  will  be  a  reporting  issuer  in  British 
Columbia,  Alberta,  Saskatchewan,  Manitoba  and  Ontario.  Spinco  has  applied  for  the  listing  of  the 
Spinco Shares to be issued under the Arrangement and issuable on the exercise of the Spinco Options 
and  Spinco  Warrants  after  completion  of  the  Arrangement.  Any  listing  of  Spinco  and  the  Spinco 
Shares will be subject to Spinco meeting the initial listing requirements of the TSX-V. There can be no 
assurance as to if, or when, the Spinco Shares will be listed or traded on the TSX-V or any other stock 
exchange.  As the Spinco Shares are not listed on a stock exchange, unless and until such a listing is 
obtained, holders of Spinco Shares may not have a market for their shares.
Distribution and Resale of New Orex Shares and Spinco Shares under Canadian Securities Laws
The  distribution  of  the  New  Common  Shares,  Spinco  Shares,  New  Orex  Options,  Spinco  Options, 
New Orex Warrants and Spinco Warrants pursuant to the Arrangement will constitute a distribution 
of securities which is exempt from the prospectus requirements of Canadian securities legislation and 
is exempt from or otherwise is not subject to the registration requirements under applicable securities 
legislation.  The  New  Common  Shares,  Spinco  Shares,  Spinco  Warrants  and  New  Orex  Warrants 
(provided  the  Orex  Warrants  for  which  such  Spinco  Warrants  and  New  Orex  Warrants  were 
exchanged were transferrable) received pursuant to the Arrangement will not bear any legend under 
Canadian Securities Laws and may be resold through registered dealers in each of the provinces of 
Canada provided that: (a) Spinco after the Arrangement and Orex is and has been a reporting issuer 
in a jurisdiction in Canada for the four months immediately preceding the trade; (b) the trade is not a 
"control distribution" as defined in NI 45-102; (c) no unusual effort is made to prepare the market or 
to create a demand for the New Common Shares and Spinco Shares; (d) no extraordinary commission 
or consideration is paid to a Person in respect of such sale; and (e) if the selling securityholder is an 
insider  or  officer  of  Orex  after  the  Arrangement  or  Spinco,  the  selling  securityholder  has  no 
reasonable grounds to believe that Orex after the Arrangement or Spinco is in default of applicable 
Securities Laws. For the purposes of (a) above, Spinco satisfies the four month requirement by virtue 
of  the  fact  that  it  is  a  party  to  the  Arrangement  Agreement  with  Orex,  which  will  have  been  a 
reporting issuer in a jurisdiction in Canada for at least four months prior to the date of distribution.

United States Securities Law Matters
The following discussion is a general overview of certain requirements of U.S. Securities Laws that 
may be applicable to Orex Shareholders in the United States ("Orex U.S. Shareholders").  All Orex 
U.S. Shareholders are urged to consult with their own legal counsel to ensure that any subsequent 
resale  of  New  Common  Shares  or  Spinco  Shares  issued  or  distributed  to  them  under  the 
Arrangement complies with applicable Securities Laws.
Further  information  applicable  to  Orex  U.S.  Shareholders  is  disclosed  under  the  heading  "Note  to 
United States Securityholders".
The following discussion does not address the Canadian Securities Laws that will apply to the issue 
and distribution of New Common Shares or Spinco Shares or the resale of these or other securities 
referred to below by Orex U.S. Shareholders within Canada, except in limited circumstances.  Orex 
U.S.  Shareholders  reselling  their  Spinco  Shares  in  Canada  must,  in  all  circumstances,  comply  with 
Canadian Securities Laws, as outlined elsewhere in this Circular.
Status under U.S. Securities Laws
Each of Orex and Spinco is, or will be, a "foreign private issuer" as defined in Rule 3b-4 under the U.S. 
Exchange  Act. 
  It  is  intended  that  the  Spinco  Shares  will  be  listed  for  trading  on  the  
TSX-V following completion of the Arrangement.  However, there is no assurance that Spinco will be 
successful in obtaining such a listing.  Spinco does not intend to seek a listing for the Spinco Shares 
on a stock exchange in the United States.
Exemption from the Registration Requirements of the U.S. Securities Act
The New Common Shares, Spinco Shares, New Orex Options, Spinco Options, New Orex Warrants 
and Spinco Warrants to be issued, distributed and exchanged, as applicable, to Orex Securityholders, 
as applicable, pursuant to the Arrangement have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. 
Securities Act or the Securities Laws of any state of the United States and will be issued, distributed 
and exchanged, as applicable, in reliance upon the Section 3(a)(10) Exemption of the U.S. Securities 
Act and exemptions provided under the Securities Laws of each state of the United States in which 
Orex  Securityholders  reside.  Section  3(a)(10)  of  the  U.S.  Securities  Act  exempts  from  registration  a 
security that is issued in exchange for outstanding securities, claims or property interests, where the 
terms and conditions of such issuance and exchange are approved, after a hearing upon the fairness 
of such terms and conditions at which all Persons to whom it is proposed to issue securities in such 
exchange have the right to appear, by a court or by a governmental authority expressly authorized by 
law to grant such approval and to hold such a hearing.  The Court is authorized to conduct a hearing 
at  which  the  fairness  of  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  Arrangement  will  be  considered.  
Accordingly,  the  Final  Order  will,  if  granted,  constitute  a  basis  for  the  exemption  from  the 
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act provided by Section 3(a)(10) thereof with respect 
to the New Common Shares, Spinco Shares, New Orex Options, Spinco Options, New Orex Warrants 
and Spinco Warrants to be received by Orex Securityholders pursuant to the Arrangement.
The  Section  3(a)(10)  Exemption  exempts  from  registration  a  security  that  is  issued  in  exchange  for 
outstanding securities where the terms and conditions of such issuance and exchange are approved, 
after  a  hearing  upon  the  fairness  of  such  terms  and  conditions  at  which  all  persons  to  whom  it  is 
proposed to issue or distribute securities in such exchange have the right to appear, by a court or by a 
governmental  authority  expressly  authorized  by  law  to  grant  such  approval  and  to  hold  such 
hearing.  All Orex Securityholders are entitled to appear and be heard at this hearing.
49
Accordingly,  the  Final  Order  will,  if  granted,  constitute  a  basis  for  the  exemption  from  the 
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act with respect to the New Common Shares and the 
Spinco Shares to be received by Orex Shareholders in connection with the Arrangement pursuant to 
Section 3(a)(10) thereof.
Resale of New Common Shares and Spinco Shares within the United States after the Completion 
of the Arrangement
The manner in which an Orex U.S. Shareholder may resell the New Common Shares and the Spinco 
Shares received on completion of the Arrangement in the United States will depend on whether such 
holder is an "affiliate" of Spinco or Orex after the Arrangement, as applicable, after the completion of 
the Arrangement or has been such an "affiliate" within 90 days of the Arrangement.
The New Common Shares and Spinco Shares, as applicable, received by a holder who is an "affiliate" 
of Orex or Spinco, as applicable, after the Arrangement or has been such an "affiliate" within 90 days 
of the Arrangement will be subject to certain restrictions on resale imposed by the U.S. Securities Act.
As  defined  in  Rule  144  under  the  U.S.  Securities  Act,  an  "affiliate"  of  an  issuer  is  a  person  that 
directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under 
common control with, the issuer.  Typically, persons who are executive officers, directors or 10% or 
greater holders of an issuer are considered to be "affiliates".
Persons who are not affiliates of Orex or Spinco, as applicable, after the Arrangement and who have 
not been affiliates  within 90 days of the resale in  question may resell the New  Common Shares  or 
Spinco  Shares,  as  applicable,  that  they  receive  in  connection  with  the  Arrangement  in  the  United 
States without restriction under the U.S. Securities Act.
Persons who are affiliates or Orex or Spinco, as applicable, after the Arrangement or who have been 
affiliates within 90 days of the resale in question may not sell their New Common Shares or Spinco 
Shares,  as  applicable,  that  they  receive  in  connection  with  the  Arrangement,  in  the  absence  of 
registration  under  the  U.S.  Securities  Act,  unless  an  applicable  exemption  from  such  registration 
requirements is available.
Regulation S
In general, under Rule 904 of Regulation S, certain persons who hold New Common Shares or Spinco 
Shares upon completion of the Arrangement, may sell them outside the United States in an "offshore 
transaction" if neither the seller, an affiliate nor any person acting on its behalf engages in "directed 
selling efforts" in the United States.  For purposes of Regulation S, "directed selling efforts" means, 
except for certain narrow permitted activities specified in Regulation S, "any activity undertaken for 
the purpose of, or that could reasonably be expected to have the effect of, conditioning the market in 
the United States for any of the securities being offered".  Also, under Regulation S, subject to certain 
exceptions contained in Regulation S, an "offshore transaction" is a transaction in which the offer of 
the  applicable  securities  is  not  made  to  a  person  in  the  United  States  or  any  person  acting  on  its 
behalf, and either: (a) at the time the buy order is originated, the buyer is outside the United States or 
the seller reasonably believes that the buyer is outside of the United States; or (b) the transaction is 
executed  in,  on  or  through  the  facilities  of  a  designated  offshore  securities  market  (which  would 
include a sale on the TSX-V) and neither the seller nor any person acting on its behalf knows that the 
transaction has been pre-arranged with a buyer in the United States.  Such resales under Rule 904 of 
Regulation S are not permitted by any person deemed to be a distributor or any person who is an 
affiliate  (other  than  any  officer  or  director  of  Orex  after  the  Arrangement  or  Spinco,  as  applicable, 
who is an affiliate solely by virtue of holding such position).  In sales by officers or directors of Orex
50
after the Arrangement or Spinco, as the case may be, in reliance on Rule 904, no selling concession, 
fee or other remuneration can be paid in connection with the sale other than the usual and customary 
broker's commission that would be received by a person executing such transaction as agent.  Certain 
additional restrictions, set forth in Regulation S, may be applicable.
The  foregoing  discussion  is  only  a  general  overview  and  summary  of  certain  requirements  of  U.S. 
Securities  Laws  that  may  be  applicable  to  the  resale  of  New  Common  Shares  or  Spinco  Shares 
received upon completion of the Arrangement.  All holders of such securities are urged to consult 
with their counsel to ensure that the resale of their securities complies with applicable securities 
legislation.
Warrant Shares and Option Shares
The New Common Shares and Spinco Shares issuable upon the exercise of the New Orex Warrants, 
Spinco Warrants, New Orex Options and Spinco Options, as applicable, in the United States or by, or 
on behalf of, a U.S. Person after the Effective Date may not be issued in reliance upon Section 3(a)(10) 
of  the  U.S.  Securities  Act  and  may  be  exercised  only  if  the  issuance  is  registered  under  the  U.S. 
Securities Act or exempt from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and pursuant to 
any applicable Securities Laws of any state of the United States.  If issued pursuant to an exemption 
from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act, New Common Shares and Spinco Shares 
will be "restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act and will be 
subject to transfer restrictions.
The solicitation of proxies made pursuant to this Circular is not subject to the requirements of Section 
14(a)  of  the  U.S.  Exchange  Act.    Accordingly,  the  solicitation  of  proxies  and  transactions 
contemplated  herein  are  being  made  in  accordance  with  Canadian  corporate  and  Securities  Laws.  
Orex  Securityholders  should  be  aware  that  requirements  under  Canadian  laws  may  differ  from 
requirements of the United States applicable to registration statements under the U.S. Securities Act 
and to proxy statements under the U.S. Exchange Act.  The financial statements and other financial 
information  included  or  incorporated  by  reference  herein  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with 
Canadian rules and regulations.
Fees and Expenses
All  expenses  incurred  in  connection  with  the  Arrangement  and  the  transactions  contemplated 
thereby will be paid by Orex.
Interest of Certain Persons in the Arrangement
In  considering  the  recommendation  of  the  Orex  Board  with  respect  to  the  Arrangement,  Orex 
Shareholders  should  be  aware  that  certain  members  of  Orex's  senior  management  and  the  Orex 
Board have certain interests in connection with the Arrangement that may present them with actual 
or potential conflicts of interest in connection with the Arrangement.
Directors
The  directors  of  Orex  (other  than  directors  who  are  also  executive  officers)  hold,  in  the  aggregate, 
735,500 Orex Shares, which represent approximately 0.7% of the voting rights attached to all of the 
issued and outstanding Orex Shares, Orex Options to acquire 1,114,000 Orex Shares, which together 
with the 735,500 Orex Shares represent approximately 1.71% of the votes attached to all issued and 
outstanding Orex Shares and Orex Options, aggregated as a single class, and 72,500 Orex Warrants, 
which  represent  approximately  0.50%  of  the  votes  attached  to  all  issued  and  outstanding  Orex
51
Warrants, all as of the Record Date. Such directors' holdings of Orex Shares, Orex Options and Orex 
Warrants represent, in the aggregate, approximately 1.56% of the outstanding Orex Securities as of 
the Record Date, on a fully-diluted basis. All of the Orex Shares, Orex Options and Orex Warrants 
held by Orex's directors will be treated in the same fashion under the Arrangement as Orex Shares, 
Orex Options and Orex Warrants held by every other Orex Shareholder, Orex Optionholder and Orex 
Warrantholder.
The  executive  officers  of  Orex  hold,  in  the  aggregate,  13,092,300  Orex  Shares,  which  represent 
approximately 12.85% of the votes attached to all issued and outstanding Orex Shares, Orex Options 
to  acquire  2,050,000  Orex  Shares,  which  together  with  the  13,092,300  Orex  Shares  represent 
approximately 14.00% of the votes attached to all of the issued and outstanding Orex Shares and Orex 
Options, aggregated as a single class, and 3,538,800 Orex Warrants, which represent approximately 
24.17% of the issued and outstanding Orex Warrants, all as of the Record Date. The executive officers' 
holdings  of  Orex  Shares,  Orex  Options,  and  Orex  Warrants  represent,  in  the  aggregate, 
approximately  15.21%  of  the  outstanding  Orex  Securities  as  of  the  Record  Date,  on  a  fully-diluted 
basis. All of the Orex Shares, Orex Options and Orex Warrants held by the executive officers of Orex 
will  be  treated  in  the  same  fashion  under  or  in  connection  with  the  Arrangement  as  Orex  Shares, 
Orex Options and Orex Warrants held by every other Orex Shareholder, Orex Optionholder or Orex 
Warrantholder.
The Arrangement Agreement
The  description  of  the  Arrangement  Agreement,  both  below  and  elsewhere  in  this  Circular,  is  a

Arrangement Agreement, which is incorporated by reference herein and may be found under Orex's

become effective at 12:01 a.m. on the Effective Date.  It is currently expected that the Effective Date 
will be on or about September 25, 2015.
Representations and Warranties
The  Arrangement  Agreement  contains  standard  representations  and  warranties  made  by  Orex  to

Risks Associated with the Arrangement
In  evaluating  the  Arrangement,  Orex  Securityholders  should  carefully  consider  the  following  risk 
factors  relating  to  the  Arrangement.  The  following  risk  factors  are  not  a  definitive  list  of  all  risk 
factors  associated  with  the  Arrangement.  Additional  risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those 
currently  unknown  or  considered  immaterial  by  Orex,  may  also  adversely  affect  the  Orex  Shares, 
New  Common  Shares,  Spinco  Shares,  New  Orex  Warrants,  New  Orex  Options,  Spinco  Options, 
Spinco Warrants and/or the businesses of Orex and Spinco following the Arrangement. In addition 
to  the  risk  factors  relating  to  the  Arrangement  set  out  below,  Orex  Securityholders  should  also 
carefully consider the risk factors associated with the businesses of Orex and Spinco included in this 
Circular and in the documents incorporated by reference herein.  If any of the risk factors materialize, 
the expectations, and the predictions based on them, may need to be re-evaluated.
54
The risks associated with the Arrangement include:
The Arrangement Agreement may be terminated at the absolute discretion of the Orex Board. 
The Orex Board has a right to terminate the Arrangement and withdraw the Plan of Arrangement at 
its absolute discretion. Accordingly, there is no certainty, nor can Orex provide any assurance, that 
the  Plan  of  Arrangement  will  not  be  terminated  by  the  Orex  Board  before  completion  of  the 
Arrangement.
There can be no certainty that all conditions precedent to the Arrangement will be satisfied.
The completion of the Arrangement is subject to a number of conditions precedent, certain of which 
are outside the control of Orex, including receipt of the Final Order and conditional listing approval 
of  the  listing  of  the  New  Common  Shares  and  the  Spinco  Shares  on  the  TSX-V.  There  can  be  no 
certainty, nor can Orex provide any assurance, that these conditions will be satisfied or, if satisfied, 
when they will be satisfied. If the Arrangement is not completed, the market price of the Orex Shares 
may  decline  to  the  extent  that  the  current  market  price  reflects  a  market  assumption  that  the 
Arrangement will be completed.
Orex will incur costs.
Certain  costs  related  to  the  Arrangement,  such  as  legal  and  accounting  fees  and  the  cost  of  the 
Valuation Report, must be paid by Orex even if the Arrangement is not completed.
Orex directors and executive officers may have interests in the Arrangement that are different from those of the 
Orex Securityholders.
In  considering  the  recommendation  of  the  Orex  Board  to  vote  in  favor  of  the  Arrangement 
Resolution, Orex Securityholders should be aware that members of the Orex Board and management 
team  have  agreements  or  arrangements  that  provide  them  with  interests  in  the  Arrangement  that 
differ  from,  or  are  in  addition  to,  those  of  Orex  Securityholders  generally.  See  "The  Meeting  –  The 
Arrangement — Interest of Certain Persons in the Arrangement".
The market price for the Orex Shares may decline.
If the Arrangement is not approved by the Orex Securityholders, the market price of the Orex Shares 
may  decline  to  the  extent  that  the  current  market  price  of  the  Orex  Shares  reflects  a  market 
assumption that the Arrangement will be completed.
Orex and Spinco will incur their own expenses going forward.
As  a  result  of  the  Arrangement,  each  of  Orex  and  Spinco  will  incur  their  own  general  and 
administrative costs to operate Orex's current mineral assets. These additional costs may negatively 
impact the financial performance of each of Orex and Spinco.
Dissent Rights
The following description of Dissent Rights is not a comprehensive statement of the procedures to be followed 
by a Dissenting Securityholder who seeks payment of the fair value of its Dissent Securities from Orex and is 
qualified in its entirety by the reference to the full text of the Interim Order which is attached at Appendix D to 
this Circular.  A Dissenting  Securityholder who intends to exercise Dissent  Rights should carefully consider 
and  comply  with  the  provisions  of  the  Interim  Order.  Failure  to  strictly  comply  with  the  provisions  of  the
55
Interim  Order,  and  to  adhere  to  the  procedures  established  therein,  may  result  in  the  loss  of  all  rights 
thereunder.
There  is  no  mandatory  statutory  right  of  dissent  and  appraisal  in  respect  of  plans  of  arrangement 
under the Business Corporations Act. However, as contemplated in the Plan of Arrangement, Orex 
has  granted  to  Orex  Securityholders  who  object  to  the  Arrangement  Resolution  the  Dissent  Rights 
which are set out in their entirety in the Interim Order, the text of which is attached at Appendix D to 
this Circular.
Pursuant  to  the  Interim  Order,  an  Orex  Securityholder  who  intends  to  exercise  the  Dissent  Rights 
must deliver a Dissent Notice to Orex at 1130 – 1055 West Hastings Street, Vancouver, BC V6E 2E9 to 
be received not later than 10:00 a.m. (Vancouver time) on September 21, 2015, or two Business Days 
before any adjournment or postponement of the Meeting and must not vote any Orex Securities in 
favour of the Arrangement. A Non-Registered Holder who wishes to exercise the Dissent Rights must 
arrange for the Registered Orex Shareholder(s) holding its Orex Shares to deliver the Dissent Notice. 
The Dissent Notice must contain all of the information specified in the Interim Order. A vote against 
the Arrangement Resolution does not constitute a Dissent Notice and an Orex  Securityholder who 
votes in favour of the Arrangement Resolution will not be considered a Dissenting Securityholder.
If the Arrangement Resolution is passed at the Meeting, Orex must send by registered mail to every 
Dissenting Securityholder, before the date set for the hearing of the Final Order, a notice (the "Notice 
of Intention") stating that, subject to receipt of the Final Order and satisfaction of the other conditions 
set out in the Arrangement Agreement, Orex intends to complete the Arrangement, and advising the 
Dissenting Securityholder that if the Dissenting Securityholder intends to proceed with his, her or its 
exercise of Dissent Rights, he she or it must deliver to Orex, within 14 days after the mailing of the 
Notice  of Intention, a written statement containing  the information  specified by the Interim Order, 
together with the certificate(s), if any, representing the Dissent Securities.
A Dissenting Securityholder delivering such a written statement may not withdraw from his, her or 
its dissent and, at the Effective Time, will be deemed to have transferred to Orex all of his, her or its 
Dissent Securities (free of any claims). Such Dissenting Securityholder will cease to have any rights as 
an Orex Securityholder other than the right to be paid the fair value of their Dissent Securities. Orex 
will pay to each Dissenting Securityholder for the Dissent Securities the amount agreed on by Orex 
and the Dissenting Securityholder. Either Orex or a Dissenting Securityholder may apply to the Court 
if no agreement on the amount to be paid for the Dissent Securities has been reached, and the Court 
may:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
determine the fair value that the Dissent Securities had immediately before the passing of the 
Arrangement  Resolution,  excluding  any  appreciation  or  depreciation  in  anticipation  of  the 
Arrangement  unless  such  exclusion  would  be  inequitable,  or  order  that  such  fair  value  be 
established by arbitration or by reference to the registrar or a referee of the Court;
join  in  the  application  each  other  Dissenting  Securityholder  who  has  not  reached  an 
agreement with Orex as to the amount to be paid for the Dissent Securities; or
make consequential orders and give directions that it considers appropriate.
Dissenting  Securityholders  who  are  ultimately  entitled  to  be  paid  fair  value  for  their  Dissent 
Securities will be entitled to be paid such fair value and will not be entitled to any other payment or 
consideration,  including  any  payment  or  consideration  that  would  be  payable  under  the  Plan  of 
Arrangement had they not exercised their Dissent Rights. The names of such holders will be removed 
from Orex's securities register(s), as applicable, as of the Effective Time.
56
If an Orex Securityholder fails to strictly comply with the requirements of the Dissent Rights set out 
in  the  Interim  Order,  it  will  lose  its  Dissent  Rights,  Orex  will  return  to  the  registered  Orex 
Securityholder  the  certificate(s),  if  any,  representing  the  Dissent  Securities  that  were  delivered  to 
Orex, if any, and, if the Arrangement is completed, that Orex Securityholder will be deemed to have 
participated  in  the  Arrangement  in  respect  of  those  Orex  Securities  on  the  same  terms  as  all  other 
Orex  Securityholders  who  are  not  Dissenting  Securityholders.  In  no  case  will  Orex,  Spinco  or  any 
other Person be required to recognize such Orex Securityholder as holding Orex Securities at or after 
the Effective Time.
Orex Securityholders wishing to exercise the Dissent Rights should consult their legal advisors with 
respect to the legal rights available to them in relation to the Arrangement and the Dissent Rights. 
Orex  Securityholders  should  note  that  the  exercise  of  Dissent  Rights  can  be  a  complex,  time-
consuming and expensive procedure.
The Interim Order outlines certain events when Dissent Rights will cease to apply where such events 
occur before payment is made to the Dissenting Securityholder of the fair value of the Orex Securities 
surrendered (including if the Arrangement Resolution does not pass or is otherwise not proceeded 
with).  In  such  events,  the  Dissenting  Securityholder  will  be  entitled  to  the  return  of  the  applicable 
share  certificate(s),  if  any,  and  rights  as  an  Orex  Securityholder  in  respect  of  the  applicable  Orex 
Securities will be regained.
CERTAIN CANADIAN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS
In  the  opinion  of  Stikeman  Elliott  LLP,  counsel  to  Orex,  the  following  summary  describes  the 
principal Canadian federal income tax considerations in respect of the Arrangement applicable to an 
Orex Shareholder who, for purposes of the Tax Act, and at all relevant times, deals at arm's length 
with each of Orex and Spinco and is not affiliated with either Orex or Spinco, holds Orex Shares as 
capital property, and disposes of such Orex Shares under the Arrangement (a "Holder").
Orex Shares will generally be considered to be capital property to a Holder unless the Holder holds 
such Orex Shares in the course of carrying on a business or the Holder acquired such Orex Shares in a 
transaction or transactions considered to be an adventure or concern in the nature of trade.
This summary is based upon the current provisions of the Tax Act and the regulations thereunder 
(the  "Regulations")  and  counsel's  understanding  of  existing  case  law  and  the  published 
administrative  practices  of  the  Canada  Revenue  Agency  ("CRA").    This  summary  also  takes  into 
account all specific proposals to amend the Tax Act and the Regulations publicly announced by or on 
behalf of the Minister of Finance (Canada) prior to the date hereof (the "Tax Proposals") and assumes 
that all Tax Proposals will be enacted in the form proposed.  However, there can be no assurance that 
the Tax Proposals will be enacted in their current form, or at all.  This summary is not exhaustive of 
all possible Canadian federal income tax considerations and, except for the Tax Proposals, does not 
take into account or anticipate any changes in law or administrative practice, whether by legislative, 
regulatory,  administrative  or  judicial  decision  or  action,  nor  does  it  take  into  account  or  consider 
other federal or any provincial, territorial or foreign tax considerations, which may differ significantly 
from the Canadian federal income tax considerations described herein.
This summary is not applicable to a Holder: (a) that is a "financial institution" (for the purposes of the 
"mark-to-market" rules), a "specified financial institution" or a "restricted financial institution", each 
as  defined  in  the  Tax  Act;  (b)  an  interest  in  which  would  be  a  "tax  shelter  investment"  within  the 
meaning  of  the  Tax  Act;  (c)  whose  "functional  currency"  for  the  purposes  of  the  Tax  Act  is  the 
currency of a country other than Canada; (d) that acquired Orex Options on the issuance or grant of 
employee stock options; (e) that acquired Orex Shares upon the exercise of employee stock options; or
57
(f) that has or will enter into a "derivative forward agreement" or a "synthetic disposition agreement" 
as such terms are defined in the Tax Act, in respect of the Orex Shares.  Such Holders should consult 
their own tax advisors.
This summary is of a general nature only and is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to 
be, legal or tax advice to any particular Orex Shareholder.  This summary is not exhaustive of all 
Canadian  federal  income  tax  considerations.  Consequently,  Orex  Shareholders  are  urged  to 
consult  their  own  tax  advisors  for  advice  regarding  the  income  tax  consequences  to  them  of 
disposing  of  their  Orex  Shares  under  the  Arrangement,  having  regard  to  their  own  particular 
circumstances, and any other consequences to them of such transactions under Canadian federal, 
provincial, local and foreign tax laws.  No advance income tax ruling has been obtained from the 
CRA to confirm the tax consequences of the Arrangement to Orex Shareholders.
Orex Shareholders Resident in Canada
The following  portion  of the summary is generally applicable to  Holders who,  for purposes of the 
Tax Act and any applicable income tax treaty or convention, and at all relevant times, are resident or 
deemed to be resident in Canada (a "Resident Holder").
Certain  Resident  Holders  whose  Orex  Shares  might  not  otherwise  be  considered  capital  property 
may, in certain circumstances, make an irrevocable election in accordance with subsection 39(4) of the 
Tax Act to have their Orex Shares and all other "Canadian securities" as defined in the Tax Act owned 
by  such  Resident  Holder  in  the  taxation  year  in which  the  election  is  made,  and  in  all  subsequent 
taxation years, deemed to be capital property.  Resident Holders should consult with their own tax 
advisors if they contemplate making such an election.
Exchange of Orex Shares for New Common Shares and Spinco Shares
Orex has informed counsel that the aggregate fair market value of all Spinco Shares when they are 
distributed  is  not expected to exceed the "paid-up capital", as defined in the Tax Act, for all  Orex 
Shares  immediately  before  the  distribution  of  Spinco  Shares  in  exchange  for  Orex  Shares. 
Accordingly,  Orex  is  not  expected  to  be  deemed  to  pay,  nor  is  a  Resident  Holder  expected  to  be 
deemed to receive, a dividend as a result of the distribution of Spinco Shares in exchange for Orex 
Shares  under  the  Arrangement.    If  the  fair  market  value  of  all  Spinco  Shares  at  the  time  of  their 
distribution were to exceed the paid-up capital of all Orex Shares immediately before that time, Orex 
would be deemed to have paid a dividend on the Orex Shares equal to the amount of the excess and 
each Resident Holder would be deemed to have received a pro rata portion of the dividend, based 
on the proportion of Orex Shares held.  See "Taxation of Dividends" below for a general description of 
the taxation of dividends under the Tax Act.
Assuming that the fair market value of all Spinco Shares at the time of distribution does not exceed 
the paid-up capital of all Orex Shares immediately before that time, a Resident Holder whose Orex 
Shares are exchanged for New Common Shares and Spinco Shares under the Arrangement will be 
considered to have disposed of the Orex Shares for proceeds of disposition equal to the greater of: (i) 
the Resident Holder's adjusted cost base of the Orex Shares immediately before the exchange; and 
(ii) the fair market value, at the time of the exchange, of the Spinco Shares received by the Resident 
Holder.  Consequently, a Resident Holder will realize a capital gain to the extent that the fair market 
value  of  the  Spinco  Shares  received  exceeds  the  adjusted  cost  base  of  the  Resident  Holder's  Orex 
Shares  at  the  time  of  the  distribution.    If  the  fair  market  value  of all  Spinco  Shares  at  the  time  of 
distribution were to exceed the paid-up capital of all Orex Shares immediately before the exchange, 
the proceeds of disposition of the Resident Holder's Orex Shares would be reduced by the amount of 
the  dividend  referred  to  in  the  previous  paragraph  that  the  Resident  Holder  is  deemed  to  have
58
received.    See  "Taxation  of  Capital  Gains  and  Capital  Losses"  below  for  a  general  description  of  the 
treatment of capital gains and losses under the Tax Act.
The cost to a Resident Holder of New Common Shares acquired on the exchange will be equal to the 
amount, if any, by which the adjusted cost base of the Resident Holder's Orex  Shares immediately 
before  the  exchange  exceeds  the  fair  market  value,  at  the  time  of  their  distribution,  of  the  Spinco 
Shares received by the Resident Holder.  The cost to a Resident Holder of the Spinco Shares acquired 
on the exchange will be equal to the fair market value of the Spinco Shares at the time of exchange.
Exchange of Orex Warrants for New Orex Warrants and Spinco Warrants
A Resident Holder who exchanges Orex Warrants for New Orex Warrants and Spinco Warrants will 
be deemed to dispose of their Orex Warrants for proceeds equal to the aggregate fair market value of 
the New Orex Warrants and Spinco Warrants received on the exchange.  Consequently, a Resident 
Holder will realize a capital gain (or a capital loss) to the extent that the aggregate fair market value 
of the New Orex Warrants and Spinco Warrants received on the exchange exceeds (or is less than) the 
adjusted cost base of the Orex Warrants immediately before the exchange and any reasonable costs 
associated  with the disposition.  In such circumstances, the  Resident  Holder  will generally acquire 
the New Orex Warrants and Spinco Warrants at a cost equal to the fair market value thereof at the 
time of the exchange.  Any such capital gain or capital loss will be subject to the general rules relating 
to  the  taxation  of  capital  gains  and  capital  losses  described  below  under  the  heading  "Taxation  of 
Capital Gains and Capital Losses".
Exchange of Orex Options for New Orex Options and Spinco Options
A Resident Holder who exchanges Orex Options for New Orex Options and Spinco Options will be 
deemed to dispose of their Orex Options for proceeds equal to the aggregate fair market value of the 
New Orex Options and Spinco Options received on the exchange.  Consequently, a Resident Holder 
will realize a capital gain (or a capital loss) to the extent that the aggregate fair market value of the 
New  Orex  Options  and  Spinco  Options  received  on  the  exchange  exceeds  (or  is  less  than)  the 
adjusted  cost  base  of  the  Orex  Options  immediately  before  the  exchange  and  any  reasonable  costs 
associated  with the disposition.  In such circumstances, the  Resident  Holder  will generally acquire 
the New Orex Options and Spinco Options at a cost equal to the fair market value thereof at the time 
of the exchange.  Any such capital gain or capital loss will be subject to the general rules relating to 
the taxation of capital gains and capital losses described below under the heading "Taxation of Capital 
Gains and Capital Losses".
Dissenting Resident Holders
A  Resident  Holder  of  Orex  Shares  who  dissents  from  the  Arrangement  (a  "Dissenting  Resident 
Holder") will be deemed to have transferred such Holder's Orex Shares to Orex, and will be entitled 
to receive a payment from Orex of an amount equal to the fair value of the Holder's Orex Shares.
A  Dissenting  Resident  Holder  will  be  deemed  to  have  received  a  taxable  dividend  equal  to  the 
amount by which the amount received from Orex for such Holder's Orex Shares, less an amount in 
respect of interest, if any, awarded by the Court, exceeds the paid-up capital of such Orex Shares (as 
determined under the Tax Act).  Any such deemed dividend will not be an eligible dividend for the 
purposes of the enhanced gross-up and dividend tax credit rules.
Where a Dissenting Resident Holder of Orex Shares is an individual, any deemed dividend will be 
included in computing that Dissenting Resident Holder's income and will be subject to the gross-up
59
and  dividend  tax  credit  rules  normally  applicable  to  dividends  (other  than  eligible  dividends) 
received from taxable Canadian corporations.
In  the  case  of  a  Dissenting  Resident  Holder  of  Orex  Shares  that  is  a  corporation,  any  deemed 
dividend will be included in income and generally will be deductible in computing taxable income. 
However, in some circumstances, the amount of any such deemed dividend realized by a corporation 
may be treated as proceeds of disposition and not as a dividend. "Private corporations" and "subject 
corporations" (as defined in the Tax Act) may be liable for refundable Part IV tax on any dividends 
received.
A Dissenting Resident Holder of Orex Shares will also be considered to have disposed of the Orex 
Shares for proceeds of disposition equal to the amount paid to such Dissenting Resident Holder less 
an  amount  in  respect  of  interest,  if  any,  awarded  by  the  Court  and  the  amount  of  any  deemed 
dividend. Dissenting Resident Holders of Orex Shares may realize a capital gain or sustain a capital 
loss in respect of such disposition. The taxation of capital gains and capital losses is discussed below 
under the heading "Taxation of Capital Gains and Capital Losses".
Any interest awarded by the Court to a Dissenting Resident Holder of Orex Shares will be included 
in such Holder's income for the purposes of the Tax Act.
A Resident Holder of Orex Warrants or Orex Options who dissents from the Arrangement is urged 
to  consult  their  own  tax  advisor  for  advice  regarding  the  income  tax  consequences  of  their 
particular circumstances.
Dividends on Spinco Shares and New Common Shares after the Arrangement
A Resident Holder (other than a Dissenting Resident Holder) who is an individual will be required to 
include  in  income  any  dividends  received  or  deemed  to  be  received  on  his  or  her  Spinco  Shares 
and/or  New  Common  Shares,  and,  other  than  certain  trusts,  will  be  subject  to  the  gross-up  and 
dividend  tax  credit  rules  applicable  to  taxable  dividends  received  from  taxable  Canadian 
corporations,  including  the  enhanced  gross-up  and  dividend  tax  credit  rules  applicable  to  any 
dividends designated by Orex and/or Spinco as "eligible dividends" as defined in the Tax Act.
A Resident Holder (other than Dissenting Resident Holder) that is a corporation will be required to 
include in income any dividend received or deemed to be received on its Spinco Shares and/or New 
Common  Shares,  and  generally  will  be  entitled  to  deduct  an  equivalent  amount  in  computing  its 
taxable income.  "Private corporations" and "subject corporations" (as defined in the Tax Act) may be 
liable for refundable Part IV tax on any dividends received.
Disposition of Spinco Shares and New Common Shares
A  Resident  Holder  that  disposes  or  is  deemed  to  dispose  of  Spinco  Shares  and/or  New  Common 
Shares in a taxation year will realize a capital gain (or a capital loss) equal to the amount by which the 
proceeds of disposition of the Spinco Shares and/or New Common Shares exceed (or are exceeded 
by) the aggregate of the adjusted cost base to the Resident Holder of such Spinco Shares and/or New 
Common  Shares,  determined  immediately  before  the  disposition,  and  any  reasonable  costs  of 
disposition.  See "Taxation  of Capital Gains and Capital Losses" below for a  general discussion  of the 
treatment of capital gains and losses under the Tax Act.

Taxation of Capital Gains and Capital Losses
Generally, a Resident Holder is required to include in computing its income for a taxation year one-
half of the amount of any capital gain (a "taxable capital gain") realized in such year.  Subject to and 
in accordance with the provisions of the Tax Act, a Resident Holder is required to deduct one-half of 
the amount of any capital loss (an "allowable capital loss") realized in a taxation year from taxable 
capital gains realized by the Resident Holder in the year.  Allowable capital losses in excess of taxable 
capital  gains  may  be  carried  back  and  deducted  in  any  of  the  three  preceding  taxation  years  or 
carried  forward  and  deducted  in  any  subsequent  taxation  year  against  net  taxable  capital  gains 
realized in such years to the extent and in the circumstances described in the Tax Act.
Additional Refundable Tax on Canadian-Controlled Private Corporation
Capital  gains  realized  by  individuals  and  certain  trusts  may  give  rise  to  a  liability  for  alternative 
minimum tax under the Tax Act.
Additional Refundable Tax
A Resident Holder, including a Dissenting Resident Holder, that is throughout the year a "Canadian-
controlled  private  corporation"  as  defined  in  the  Tax  Act  may  be  liable  to  pay  an  additional 
refundable tax of 6 2/3% on certain investment income, including taxable capital gains and interest.
Orex Shareholders Not Resident in Canada
The following portion of the summary is generally applicable to a Holder, who for purposes of the 
Tax Act and the applicable income tax treaty or convention, and at all relevant times, is not and has 
not been a resident or deemed to be a resident of Canada and does not use or hold, and is not deemed 
to use or hold, Orex Shares in connection with carrying on a business in Canada (a "Non-Resident 
Holder").  Special rules, which are not discussed in this summary, apply to a non-resident that is an 
insurer carrying on business in Canada and elsewhere.
Share Exchanges and Subsequent Disposition of Shares, Options and Warrants
A Non-Resident Holder will not be subject to tax under the Tax Act on any capital gain realized on a 
disposition  of  Orex  Shares,  Spinco  Shares,  New  Common  Shares,  New  Orex  Warrants,  Spinco 
Warrants, New Orex Options and/or Spinco Options unless, at the time of exchange or disposition, 
such shares, options or warrants are taxable Canadian property to the Non-Resident Holder and are 
not treaty protected property (as defined in the Tax Act) of the Non-Resident Holder.
Taxation of Capital Gains and Capital Losses
Provided  that  the  Orex  Shares,  Spinco  Shares  and/or  New  Common  Shares  are  listed  on  a 
"designated  stock  exchange",  the  Orex  Shares,  Spinco  Shares,  New  Common  Shares,  New  Orex 
Warrants, Spinco Warrants, New Orex Options and/or Spinco Options generally will not constitute 
taxable Canadian property of a Non-Resident Holder, unless, at any time during the 60-month period 
immediately  preceding  the  disposition:  (a)  the  Non-Resident  Holder;  (b)  persons  with  whom  the 
Non-Resident Holder does not deal at arm's length; or (c) the Non-Resident Holder together with all 
such persons, owned, or had an interest in, 25% or more of the issued shares of any class or series of 
shares in the capital stock of Orex and/or Spinco; and the Orex Shares, Spinco Shares and/or New 
Common Shares derived (directly or indirectly) more than 50% of their fair market value from real or 
immovable property situated in Canada, Canadian resource properties, timber resource properties or 
options or interests in respect of any such property, all as defined for the purposes of the Tax Act.
61
A disposition or deemed disposition of such shares, options or warrants by a Non-Resident Holder 
whose  shares,  options  or  warrants  are  taxable  Canadian  property  and  who  is  not  entitled  to  an 
exemption  under  an  applicable  income  tax  convention,  will  give  rise  to  a  capital  gain  (or  a  capital 
loss) equal to the amount, if any, by which the proceeds of disposition, less the reasonable costs of 
disposition, exceed (or are less than) the adjusted cost of such shares, options or warrants to the Non-
Resident Holder at the time of actual or deemed disposition. Generally, one-half of any capital gain 
realized  will  be  required  to  be  included  in  income  as  a  taxable  capital  gain  and  will  be  taxed  at 
applicable  Canadian  tax  rates.  One-half  of  any  capital  loss  will  be  deductible,  subject  to  certain 
limitations, against certain taxable capital gains in the year of disposition or the three preceding years 
or  any  subsequent  year  in  accordance  with  the  detailed  provisions  of  the  Tax  Act.  Non-Resident 
Holders to whom these rules may be relevant should consult their own tax advisers in this regard.
Dividends on Spinco Shares and New Common Shares
Dividends  paid,  or  credited,  or  deemed  to  be  paid  or  credited,  on  Spinco  Shares  and/or  New 
Common Shares to a Non-Resident Holder generally will be subject to Canadian withholding tax at a 
rate of 25% of the gross amount of the dividend, unless the rate is reduced under the provisions of an 
applicable  income  tax  convention.    The  rate  of  withholding  tax  under  The  Canada-U.S.  Income  Tax 
Convention (1980) (the "Treaty") applicable to a Non-Resident Holder, who is a resident of the United 
States for the purposes of the Treaty, is the beneficial owner of the dividend, is entitled to all of the 
benefits under the Treaty, and who holds less than 10% of the voting stock of Spinco Shares and/or 
New Common Shares, generally will be 15%.
Dissenting Non-Resident Holders
A  Non-Resident  Holder  of  Orex  Shares  who  dissents  from  the  Arrangement  (a  "Dissenting  Non-
Resident Holder") will be deemed to have transferred such Holder's Orex Shares to Orex, and will be 
entitled  to receive a payment from Orex of an amount equal to the fair value  of the  Non-Resident 
Holder's Orex Shares. Non-Resident Holders who intend to dissent from the Arrangement are urged 
to consult their own tax advisors.
A Dissenting Non-Resident Holder will be deemed to have received a taxable dividend equal to the 
amount by which the amount received from Orex for such Non-Resident Holder's Orex Shares, less 
an amount in respect of interest, if any, awarded by the Court, exceeds the paid-up capital of such 
Orex Shares (as determined by the Tax Act).  The amount of the dividend will be subject to Canadian 
withholding  tax  at  the  rate  of  25%  of  the  gross  amount  of  the  dividend  unless  the  rate  is  reduced 
under  the  provisions  of  an  applicable  income  tax  convention  between  Canada  and  the  Dissenting 
Non-Resident Holder's country of residence.
A Dissenting  Non-Resident Holder  of Orex Shares will also be considered to  have disposed  of the 
Orex Shares for proceeds of disposition equal to the amount paid to such Dissenting Non-Resident 
Holder less an amount in  respect of interest, if any,  awarded by the Court and the amount  of any 
deemed dividend, and will be subject to tax under the Tax Act on any gain realized as a result if such 
shares  constitute  "taxable  Canadian  property"  as  discussed  above  under  the  heading  "Taxation  of 
Capital Gains and Capital Losses", unless relief is provided under an income tax treaty or convention 
between Canada and the Dissenting Non-Resident Holder's country of residence.
A Non-Resident Holder of Orex Warrants or Orex Options who dissents from the Arrangement is 
urged to consult their own tax advisor for advice regarding the income tax consequences of their 
particular circumstances.

Orex or Spinco, as the case may be; and (b) does not have a "significant interest", within the meaning 
of the Tax Act, in Orex or Spinco, as the case may be.
Holders should consult their own tax advisors to ensure New Common Shares and Spinco Shares 
would not be a prohibited investment in their particular circumstances. Holders of Orex Warrants 
should  consult  their  own  tax  advisors  regarding  the  eligibility  for  investment  of  New  Orex 
Warrants and Spinco Warrants.

Orex  Shares  that  were  exchanged  for  New  Common  Shares  and  Spinco  Shares  in 
accordance  with  Subsection  2.3(b)  hereof,  together  with  such  other  documents  and 
instruments  contemplated  by  the  Letter  of  Transmittal  and  such  additional 
documents  and  instruments  as  the  Depositary  may  reasonably  require,  the  Former

deliver  to  such  Former  Orex  Shareholder  share  certificates  or  Direct  Registration

entitled to receive in accordance with Subsection 2.3(b) hereof.
4.2

fact by the holder claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary will deliver 
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the New Common Shares and Spinco Shares 
that such holder is entitled to receive in accordance with Section 4.1 hereof.  When authorizing such 
delivery  of  New  Common  Shares  and  Spinco  Shares  that  such  holder  is  entitled  to  receive  in 
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the holder to whom such New Common Shares 
and  Spinco  Shares  is  to  be  delivered  will,  as  a  condition  precedent  to  the  delivery  of  such  New

Depositary in a manner satisfactory to Orex and the Depositary, against any claim that may be made 
against  Orex  or  the  Depositary  with  respect  to  the  certificate  alleged  to  have  been  lost,  stolen  or 
destroyed and will otherwise take such actions as may be required by the articles of Orex.

Common Shares or Spinco Shares with a record date after the Effective Time will be delivered to the 
holder  of  any  unsurrendered  certificate  that,  immediately  before  the  Effective  Time,  represented 
outstanding Orex Shares unless and until the holder of such certificate will have complied with the 
provisions of Sections 4.1 or 4.2 hereof.  Subject to applicable law and to Section 4.6 hereof, at the time 
of such compliance, there will, in addition to the delivery of New Common Shares and Spinco Shares 
to which such holder is thereby entitled, be delivered to such holder, without interest, the amount of

distributions or other amounts otherwise payable to any Former Orex Shareholder such amounts as 
Orex, Spinco or the Depositary is required or permitted to deduct and withhold with respect to such 
payment under the Tax Act, the Code or any provision  of any applicable federal, provincial, state, 
local or foreign tax law or treaty.  To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts 
will be treated for all purposes hereof as having been paid to the Former Orex Shareholder in respect 
of  which  such  deduction  and  withholding  was  made,  provided,  however,  that  such  withheld 
amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent that any shares or 
other non-cash consideration is required to be deducted or withheld from any payment to a holder, 
any of Orex, Spinco or the Depositary is hereby authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of shares or 
other  consideration  as  is  necessary  to  provide  sufficient  funds  to  enable  Orex,  Spinco  or  the 
Depositary  to  comply  with  all  deduction  or  withholding  requirements  applicable  to  it,  and  Orex, 
Spinco or the Depositary will notify the holder thereof and remit to the holder thereof any unapplied 
balance of the net proceeds of such sale.
4.5
Withholding relating to Former Orex Optionholders
Orex  will  be  entitled  to  deduct  and  withhold  from  any  amount  payable  to  any  Former  Orex 
Optionholder,  such  amount  as  is  required  or  permitted  to  be  deducted  or  withheld  under  the  Tax 
Act, the Code or any provision of any applicable federal, provincial, state, local or foreign tax law or 
treaty  including  the  right  to  withhold  New  Orex  Options  if  required  (the "Withholding 
Obligations").
Orex shall have the right, in its discretion, to satisfy any Withholding Obligations by:
(a)
(b)
(c)
causing to be exercised, such number of New Orex Options as is sufficient to fund 
the Withholding Obligations;
selling  or  causing  to  be  sold,  on  behalf  of  any  Former  Orex  Optionholder,  such 
number  of  New  Common  Shares  issued  to  the  Former  Orex  Optionholder  on  the 
exercise of New Orex Options as is sufficient to fund the Withholding Obligations;
retaining  the  amount  necessary  to  satisfy  the  Withholding  Obligations  from  any 
amount which would otherwise be delivered, provided or paid to the Former Orex 
Optionholder by Orex; and
(d)
making such other arrangements as Orex may reasonably require.
The sale of New Common Shares by Orex, or by a broker engaged by Orex (the  "Broker"), will be 
made  on  the  TSX-V.  The  Former  Orex  Optionholder  consents  to  such  sale  and  grants  to  Orex  an 
irrevocable power of attorney to effect the sale of such New Common Shares on his or her behalf and 
acknowledges and agrees that (i) the number of New Common Shares sold shall, at a minimum, be 
sufficient  to  fund  the  Withholding  Obligations  net  of  all  selling  costs,  which  costs  are  the 
responsibility  of  the  Former  Orex  Optionholder  and  which  the  Former  Orex  Optionholder  hereby 
authorizes to be deducted from the proceeds of such sale; (ii) in effecting the sale of any such New 
Common Shares, Orex or the Broker will exercise its sole judgment as to the timing and the manner 
of sale and will not be obligated to seek or obtain a minimum price; and (iii) neither Orex nor the
B-10
Broker will be liable for any loss arising out of any sale of such New Common Shares including any 
loss  relating  to  the  pricing,  manner  or  timing  of  such  sales  or  any  delay  in  transferring  any  New 
Common  Shares  to  the  Former  Orex  Optionholder  or  otherwise.    The  Former  Orex  Optionholder 
further acknowledges that the sale price of such New Common Shares will fluctuate with the market 
price  of  the  New  Common  Shares  and  no  assurance can  be  given  that  any  particular  price  will  be 
received upon any sale.
4.6
Limitation and Proscription

repayment  of  capital  in  respect  thereof  and  such New  Common  Shares  and  Spinco  Shares,  will  be 
delivered  to  Orex  by  the  Depositary  and  the  share  certificates  or  Direct  Registration  Advices 
representing such New Common Shares and Spinco Shares will be cancelled, and the interest of the

Attn:  Board of Directors
Dear Sirs:
Re:  A Fairness Opinion Regarding Orex Minerals Inc.’s Proposed ‘Spin-Out’ of the
Barsele Project and a Valuation of Barsele Minerals Corp. and Orex Minerals Inc.
Executive Summary
Ross Glanville & Associates Ltd. (“Glanville”) and Bruce McKnight Minerals Advisor Services 
(“McKnight”) have been retained by the Board of Directors of Orex Minerals Inc. (“Orex”, or the 
Company)  to  determine  the  fairness  to  the  shareholders  of Orex  (the  “Fairness  Opinion” 
or ”Opinion”) of the proposed reorganization of Orex, involving a series of transactions, under 
which Orex's 45% interest in the Barsele Project will be transferred by Orex to Barsele Minerals 
Corp.  (“SpinCo”),  currently  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  Orex,  and  the  remaining  mineral 
exploration  properties  of  Orex  will  stay  with  New  Orex (in  this  report,  “New  Orex”  refers  to 
Orex after its 45% interest the Barsele Project has been spun out to Barsele). The transaction is 
expected to be completed via a plan of arrangement (the “Proposed Arrangement”) under section 
288 of the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). Pursuant to the Proposed Arrangement,
each  issued  and  outstanding  Orex  share  will  be  exchanged  for  one  New  Orex  share  and  one 
SpinCo share. In addition to the spinout of Orex's 45% interest in the Barsele Project, SpinCo 
will also  receive  cash of  $0.5 million1 from  Orex. Additional  information  on  the  Proposed 
Arrangement is  set  out  in  this  report,  with  the details  to be  provided  in  the  arrangement
agreement to be entered into by Orex and SpinCo (the “Arrangement Agreement”), which will be 
incorporated in a management information circular (the “Information Circular”) to be provided to
1 All dollars in this report are Canadian dollars, unless specifically stated as US dollars.
C-2
the  shareholders  of  Orex in  connection  with  a  meeting  to  be  held  to  approve  the  Proposed 
Arrangement (the  “Meeting”).  As  part  of  the  Fairness  Opinion,  Glanville  and  McKnight  will 
estimate the values of the mineral properties of Orex, and also determine the value of SpinCo and 
New  Orex  (which  will  involve  the  incorporation  of  other  assets  and  liabilities,  of  which  the 
working capital will be the largest of these other components).
Orex is a Canadian-based exploration company listed on the TSX Venture Exchange (the “TSX-
V”), with its trading symbol being REX. As of the date hereof, there are 101,890,199 Orex shares 
issued  and  outstanding,  and  the daily  closing  share  trading  prices  over  the  past  three  months
ranged from $0.165 to $0.270 (with the closing price of $0.18 per share on July 23, 2015). The 
high  and  low  prices  over  the  past  year  were  $0.430 and  $0.135,  respectively. As  at  April  30, 
2015, Orex had $7.591 million in working capital. Taking account the receipt of US$6.0 million 
from  Agnico  Eagle  Mines  Limited  (“Agnico  Eagle”) (see  next  paragraph)  as  well  as  ongoing 
expenditures, the current working capital is estimated to be approximately $6.0 million.
Orex’s major properties consist of its interests in Barsele gold project in Sweden, and the Coneto 
and Los Crestones silver-gold projects in Mexico. The Company also owns 100% of the Jumping 
Josephine project in British Columbia. Regarding Barsele, Orex received a National Instrument 
43-101- Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”) compliant resource estimate 
(based on a cut-off of 0.6 grams of gold per tonne) in May of 2014 that defined 547,000 ounces 
of gold in the indicated category (14.1 million tonnes grading 1.21 g/t gold) and 627,000 ounces 
of gold in the inferred category (20.2 million tonnes grading 0.97 g/t gold). On June 11, 2015, 
Orex  announced  that  it had  closed  the  joint  venture  transaction  with  Agnico  Eagle  that  was 
previously  announced  on  February  23,  2015  (the  “Transaction”).  Pursuant  to  the  Transaction, 
Agnico  Eagle,  through  its  indirect,  wholly-owned  subsidiary  Agnico  Eagle  Sweden  AB  (“AE 
Sweden”),  acquired  a  55%  interest  in  Gunnarn  Mining  A.B.  (“Gunnarn”),  the  corporate  entity 
which owns the Barsele Project, in consideration of an initial payment to Orex of US$6.0 million. 
An  additional  US$2.0 million  will  be  payable  by  AE  Sweden,  or  by  Agnico  Eagle  on  AE 
Sweden’s behalf, to Orex in cash or common shares of Agnico Eagle at AE Sweden’s election on 
each of the first and second anniversaries of the closing of the Transaction. AE Sweden has also 
committed to spend US$7.0 million on Barsele Project expenditures over three years. In addition, 
if  Agnico  Eagle  or  AE  Sweden  prepares  a  pre-feasibility  study  on  the  Barsele  Project  and 
contributes  it  to  Gunnarn,  AE  Sweden's  interest  in  Gunnarn  will  increase  to  70%  and  Orex's 
interest in Gunnarn will be reduced to 30%. If Agnico Eagle decides to prepare a pre-feasibility 
study, until such pre-feasibility study is contributed to Gunnarn by Agnico Eagle or AE Sweden, 
all  costs  and  expenses  of  Gunnarn  will  be  for  the  account  of  AE  Sweden  and,  following  the 
completion of such pre-feasibility study, all costs and expenses of Gunnarn will be shared by the 
AE Sweden and Orex in accordance with their proportionate interest in Gunnarn. Regarding the 
Coneto project, Orex signed an association agreement with Fresnillo PLC (“Fresnillo”) whereby 
the Orex and Fresnillo properties in the area were ‘consolidated’, and Fresnillo has the option to 
incur  substantial  exploration  expenditures  in  order  to  earn  interests  in  the  combined  property
varying from 55% to 70% (spending US$6.0 million over three years to earn 55%, and spending 
up to an additional $21.0 million to increase its interest to 70%). Fresnillo is also Orex’s second 
largest  shareholder.  The  Los  Crestones  property,  100%  owned  by  Orex, hosts  numerous 
mineralized  showings  and  small-scale  workings,  and  is  considered  prospective  for  vein  and 
breccia-hosted  low-sulphidation  epithermal  gold  and  silver.  On  the  Jumping  Josephine  project 
(now  owned  100%  by  Orex),  drilling  to  date  has  identified  an  NI  43-101  compliant  resource 
estimate  (at  a  cut-off  grade  of  0.5  g/t  gold)  that has  defined  34,000  ounces  of  gold  (363,000
C-3
tonnes  grading  2.95  g/t  gold)  in  the  indicated  category  and  30,000  ounces  (448,000  tonnes 
grading 2.08 g/t gold) in the inferred category.
In order to provide the Fairness Opinion and determine the values of the major projects of Orex,
Glanville and McKnight, among other things, reviewed the technical reports provided by Orex, 
reviewed SEDAR filings of Orex, read the information on the Company website, reviewed in-situ 
values per ounce of  gold in resources for peer  companies/properties, considered sale/purchase,
option, and joint venture agreements (including those with Agnico Eagle and Fresnillo), analyzed 
publicly-listed companies with similar or comparable portfolios of mineral properties, considered 
other assets and liabilities of Orex, obtained the current financial position of the Company, and 
reviewed issued shares, options, and warrants of Orex.
Based  on  the  foregoing,  Glanville  and  McKnight  estimated  the  values  of  the net  beneficial 
interests of Orex (in Canadian dollars) in its mineral exploration properties (and working capital) 
after taking into account ownership percentages, royalties payable, and option terms (remaining 
payments, share issuances, and exploration commitments). The major components of value are 
summarized below:
Barsele Project:
$22.5 million2
                        Coneto Project:                                                                    7.0 million
Working Capital:                                                                 6.0 million
                        Los Crestones:                                                                     3.1 million
                        Jumping Josephine.:                                                            0.5 million
$39.1 million
Total Value of Mineral Properties:
Pursuant  to  the  Proposed  Arrangement, Orex  is  planning  to  spin  out  its 45%  interest  in  the 
Barsele  Project  to  SpinCo.  However,  the  2%  NSR  royalty  and  the  future  cash  payments  from 
Agnico Eagle (US$2.0 million at each of the first and second anniversary of the closing of the 
Transaction) will be retained by New Orex (as well as the US$6.0 million cash payment already 
received by Orex). As a result, the value of the assets to be spun out to SpinCo is estimated to be 
approximately $15.5 million ($15.0 million value of SpinCo’s beneficial interest in Barsele3, plus 
$0.5 million cash from Orex). As a result of the foregoing, the value of the assets to remain with 
New Orex would be $23.6 million ($39.1 million minus $15.5 million).
Based on the foregoing, the value of SpinCo would account for almost 40% of the existing value 
of Orex ($15.5 million divided by $39.1 million), and the value of New Orex would account for 
just over 60% of Orex ($23.6 million divided by $39.1 million). However, due to the fact that 
valuations of early-stage exploration projects are not precise, Glanville and McKnight are of the 
opinion that the value of SpinCo would account for somewhere between 35% and 45% of the 
total value of all of Orex.
Glanville and McKnight also considered the following, among other items, in order to provide 
their fairness opinion on the Proposed Arrangement:
(cid:120)
the general market conditions for selling/buying mineral resource properties;
2 This excludes the US$6.0 million (about Cdn$7.5 million) already received by Orex. As a result, the total valuation 
of  Barsele  would  have  been  approximately  Cdn$30.0  million. The  cash  received  by  Orex  from  Agnico Eagle is 
accounted for as working capital.

C-4
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
the prior exploration expenditures on the mineral exploration projects; 
the ongoing and planned exploration on the respective properties; 
the possible economics associated with the various projects;
option, sale/purchase and joint venture agreements; and
such  other  reviews,  calculations,  analyses,  research,  and  investigations  deemed 
appropriate.
Based upon and subject to the limitations in this Fairness Opinion, and such other matters 
as McKnight and Glanville have considered relevant, it is their opinion that, as of the date 
hereof, the terms of the proposed Arrangement are fair from a financial point of view to the 
Orex  shareholders.  However,  Glanville  and  McKnight  express  no  opinion  as  to  the  expected 
trading prices of the shares of SpinCo and New Orex if the Proposed Arrangement is completed, 
or of Orex if it is terminated.
Engagement of Glanville & McKnight
The board of directors of Orex (the “Board”) has retained the services of Glanville and McKnight 
Minerals in connection with the Fairness Opinion. Glanville’s and McKnight’s services include 
providing advice and assistance to the Board in connection with the proposed Arrangement, and 
the preparation and delivery to the Board of Orex an Opinion as to the fairness of the Proposed 
Arrangement. Glanville and McKnight will be paid a fee for their services as financial advisors to 
Orex, but the fees are not contingent on completion of the proposed Arrangement. In addition, 
Glanville and McKnight are to be indemnified in respect of certain liabilities that might arise out 
of the preparation of the Fairness Opinion. Glanville and McKnight express no opinion, nor have 
they  been  requested  to  do  so,  as  to  the  expected  trading  price  of  the  shares  of  New  Orex or 
SpinCo if the proposed Arrangement is completed, or of Orex if it is terminated.
McKnight and Glanville have utilized assumptions and input parameters in this Fairness Opinion 
that  they  believe  are  reasonable  and  appropriate  based  on  industry  standards.  Major  caveats 
include  the  uncertainty  of  future  exploration,  development,  and  production  results,  the  future 
price of commodities (in particular, the gold price), changes to government regulations, country 
risk,  and  general  environmental  concerns.  The  geological  reports,  websites,  and  other 
publications,  as  well  as Orex's  filings  on  the  SEDAR  site,  contain  information  on  the  various 
exploration  projects.  As  a  result,  only  brief  summaries  of  the  projects  are  presented  in  this 
Fairness Opinion.
Use of Fairness Opinion
McKnight and Glanville specifically agree that this Opinion may be filed with the TSX-V and 
applicable securities commissions or other regulators, and provided to the shareholders of Orex if 
required by regulatory authorities.
Relationship with Interested Parties
Glanville and McKnight are independent arm’s-length consultants who do not have a financial 
interest  (nor  do  they  expect  to  have  any  future  interest),  directly  or  indirectly,  in  Orex (or  its
subsidiaries or associated companies), nor do they expect any consideration other than the fee and
C-5
expenses from Orex for the preparation of this Fairness Opinion, nor is their fee contingent upon 
the completion of the proposed Arrangement.

Scope of Review
Glanville  and  McKnight  did  not  visit  Orex’s mineral  properties  in  connection  with  this 
assignment,  nor  did  they  perform  independent  geological  or  mining  investigations.  Formal 
valuations of Orex or their mineral properties, within the meaning of Multilateral Instrument 61-
101  –  Protection  of  Minority  Security  Holders  in  Special  Transactions,  were  not  undertaken; 
however,  informal  valuations  were  prepared  as  part  of  the  Fairness  Opinion.  These  informal 
valuations  considered  comparable  values  per  ounce  of  contained  gold  in  resources,  option 
agreements,  prior  expenditures,  exploration  results,  and  comparisons  with  values  of  similar 
projects.
Specifically, Glanville and McKnight reviewed and relied upon, or carried out (as the case may 
be) the following, among other things:
the technical reports on the mineral properties of Orex;
certain publicly available financial and other information concerning Orex;  
correspondence and discussions with directors/officers/management of Orex;  
news releases of Orex over the past year; 
the transaction agreements between Orex, Gunnarn, AE Sweden and Agnico Eagle; 
estimated prior expenditures on the exploration properties of Orex;   
information on the website of Orex;

Assumptions and Limitations
In  providing  this  Fairness  Opinion,  Glanville  and  McKnight  assumed  and  relied  upon  the 
accuracy and completeness of all technical, financial, and other information furnished to them by 
Orex and  by  its  consultants  and  representatives.  They  have  not  undertaken  any  specific
C-7
independent  verification  of  such  information  (although  data  was  reviewed  to  determine  its 
“reasonableness”).  However,  Glanville  and  McKnight  have  no  reason  to  believe  that  the 
information provided to them is not accurate or complete, and they have not been denied access 
to any information that they requested from the management or directors of Orex.
Glanville and McKnight decided upon the methodologies to be utilized in this Fairness Opinion, 
and  did  not  request  or  receive,  from  the  management of  Orex,  suggestions  as  to  the 
methodologies that might have been utilized. Glanville and McKnight have relied upon technical 
and  financial  reports,  discussions  with  executives/officers  of  Orex,  information  provided  by 
management/directors of Orex, publicly available results to date, and comparable properties.
This  Fairness  Opinion  is  rendered  on  the  basis  of  securities  markets,  economic  and  general 
business  and  financial  conditions  prevailing  as  at  the  date  hereof,  and  the  conditions  and 
prospects, financial and otherwise, of Orex as they are reflected in the information, data and other 
material (financial or otherwise) reviewed by Glanville and McKnight as they were represented 
to them in discussions with management of Orex, and a review of information provided by Orex.
Glanville and McKnight have made assumptions with respect to industry performance, general 
business,  market  and  economic  conditions  and  other  matters,  many  of  which  are  beyond  the 
control of any party involved with the Proposed Arrangement. Although Glanville and McKnight 
believe that these assumptions are reasonable with respect to Orex (and the industry in which it
operates), to the extent that they are incorrect it may affect their view as to the fairness of the 
proposed Arrangement to the shareholders of Orex.
It  should  be  noted  that  this  report  is  a  Fairness  Opinion,  not  a  technical  report.  As  a  result, 
Glanville  and  McKnight  have  not  provided  detailed  information  that has  been  included  in  the 
technical reports. Those reports contain information regarding geology, mineralization, drilling, 
sampling, assaying, and exploration and development histories.
Orex has acknowledged that the services provided by Glanville and McKnight were provided in 
an advisory capacity only, and that Glanville and McKnight are not liable for losses, damages, or 
other claims that may result from or be alleged to result from any application or use that Orex
and/or others may make of such information, data and opinions of Glanville and McKnight. Orex
has waived, released, indemnified and agreed to hold Glanville and McKnight harmless from any 
and all liability for losses, damages, legal costs and other claims arising from the Opinion and/or 
related  issues.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  this  indemnity  shall  not  apply  to  Glanville  and 
McKnight to the extent that a court ruling, that has become non-appealable, shall determine that:
(i)
(ii)
Glanville or McKnight, as the case may be, has been negligent or dishonest or has
committed any fraudulent or wilful misconduct act in the course of performance of 
its respective duties hereunder; and
the  expenses,  costs,  losses,  claims,  damages  or  liabilities,  as  to  which 
indemnification  is  claimed  (up  to  a  maximum  of  the  fees  paid  to  Glanville  and 
McKnight), primarily resulted from such negligence, dishonesty, fraud  or wilful 
misconduct referred to in (i).
Glanville and McKnight have not conducted a review of the mineral titles, ownership, resources, 
costs, production or environmental obligations, and consequently Glanville and McKnight have 
not  expressed  any  opinion  on  these  subjects.  Glanville  and  McKnight  do  not  accept  any
C-8
responsibility for errors or omissions pertaining to information provided by Orex, or its lawyers, 
advisors, directors, agents, or other related parties.
Glanville and McKnight reserve the right to amend or withdraw this Fairness Opinion in certain 
circumstances,  including  in  the  event  that  there occurs  a  material  change  of  facts  or 
representations  upon  which  Glanville  and  McKnight  relied,  or  in  the  event  that  Glanville  and 
McKnight reasonably conclude that the information provided to them or any representation they 
relied upon contains an untrue statement of material fact or omits to state a material fact that, in 
their reasonable opinion, would make this Fairness Opinion untrue or inaccurate in any material 
respect.  However,  Glanville  and  McKnight  are  under  no  obligation  to  make  any  subsequent 
changes or provide notification to anyone of such changes to the information. The management 
and directors of Orex should inform Glanville and McKnight if anything in this Fairness Opinion, 
or any of the information on which it is based, is, in their opinion, inaccurate or misleading in any 
way.
Glanville and McKnight have also assumed that all material governmental, regulatory, court, or 
other  approvals  and  consents  required  in  connection  with  the  consummation  of  the  Proposed 
Arrangement will  be  obtained,  and  that  in  connection  with  obtaining  any  necessary 
governmental, regulatory, court, or other approvals and consents, no limitations, restrictions or 
conditions will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on Orex’s shareholders.
This Fairness Opinion is addressed to and is for the sole use and benefit of the Board and Orex's 
shareholders, and may not be referred to, summarized, circulated, publicized or reproduced by 
Orex, other than in the Information Circular, or disclosed to, used or relied upon by any other 
party without the express written consent of Glanville and McKnight.
McKnight and Glanville believe their analyses must be considered as a whole, and that selecting 
portions of the analyses or the factors considered by them, without considering all factors and 
analyses together, could create a misleading view of the process underlying the Fairness Opinion. 
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complicated process, and is not necessarily susceptible 
to partial analysis or summary description. Any attempt to do so could lead to undue emphasis on 
any particular factor or analysis.
Confidentiality
Glanville  and  McKnight  and each  of  their  respective  directors,  officers,  associates,  employees 
and agents will keep strictly confidential, and will use only for the purpose of performing their 
obligations  hereunder,  all  information,  whether  written  or  oral,  acquired  from  Orex and  its 
subsidiaries and respective agents and advisors in connection with their work hereunder except 
information  that  was  made  generally  available  to  the  public  prior  to  this  engagement  or  that
thereafter  becomes  generally  available  to  the  public  other  than  through  a  breach  by  Glanville, 
McKnight, or any of their respective directors, officers, associates, employees and agents, of their 
obligations  hereunder  or  was  known  by  any  such  person  prior  to  this  engagement  that  was 
provided  and/or  obtained  on  a  non-confidential  basis  and  except  to  the  extent  that  any  such 
person is required by law or in connection with any legal process or regulatory proceedings to 
disclose  such  information,  in  which  case  they  shall  only  disclose  that  information  specifically 
required to be so disclosed, after receiving advice of counsel. If any such person is so required to 
disclose  any  such  information,  they  shall  provide  Orex with  advance  written  notice  of  such 
requirement so that Orex may seek an appropriate protective order.
C-9
Proposed Arrangement
The Proposed Arrangement involves a series of transactions, under which Orex's 45% interest in 
the Barsele Project will be transferred by Orex to SpinCo and the remaining mineral exploration 
properties and interests of Orex will stay with New Orex. The transaction is expected to be via a 
plan  of  arrangement  under  section  288  of  the  Business  Corporations  Act  (British  Columbia).
Pursuant  to  the  Proposed  Arrangement, each  issued  and  outstanding  Orex  share  will  be 
exchanged for one New Orex share and one SpinCo share. In addition to the spinout of Orex's 
45% interest in the Barsele mineral exploration property, SpinCo will also receive cash of $0.5 
million from Orex. Additional information on the Proposed Arrangement is set out in this report, 
with the details to be provided in the Arrangement Agreement, which will be incorporated in the 
Information Circular to be provided to the shareholders of Orex. As part of the Fairness Opinion, 
Glanville and McKnight have estimated the values of the mineral properties of Orex, and have 
also determined the value of SpinCo and New Orex (which involved the incorporation of other 
assets and liabilities, of which the working capital is the largest of these other components).
Some of the additional terms of the Arrangement Agreement are set out below:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
the  TSX-V  will  have  conditionally  approved  the  listing  of  New  Orex  and  SpinCo 
common shares issuable under the Proposed Arrangement, subject to compliance with the 
normal listing requirements of the TSX-V
(cid:120) Orex  will  have  received  satisfactory  advice  from  its  counsel  as to the  Canadian  tax
consequences of the Proposed Arrangement to Orex and the Orex shareholders 
all outstanding Orex options will be exchanged for ‘equivalent’ options of New Orex and 
SpinCo, subject to adjustment to the exercise prices of such New Orex and Spinco options 
to reflect the relative values of the companies;
all outstanding Orex warrants will be exchanged for ‘equivalent’ warrants of New Orex 
and SpinCo, with the exercise price of each such New Orex warrant and SpinCo warrant 
being equal to the exercise price of the Orex warrant so exchanged; and
the  requisite  majorities for  the  passing  of  the resolutions  approving  the  Proposed 
Arrangement (the ”Arrangement Resolution”) will be: (i) two thirds of the votes cast on 
the Proposed Arrangement Resolution by registered Orex shareholders and optionholders, 
voting together as a single class, present in person or by proxy at the Meeting; and (ii) two 
thirds  of  the  votes  cast  on  the  Proposed  Arrangement Resolution  by  registered  Orex 
Warrantholders present in person or by proxy at the Meeting.
The  completion  of  the  Proposed  Arrangement will  also  be  subject  to  a  number  of  typical 
conditions  precedent,  including  approvals  of  the  securityholders  of  Orex and  the  conditional 
approval of the TSX-V for the listing of the New Orex and Spinco shares having been obtained 
and the granting of the interim order and final order by the British Columbia Supreme Court.
Orex Minerals Inc.  
Orex is  a  Canadian-based  exploration  company  listed  on  the  TSX-V,  with  its  trading  symbol 
being REX. As of the date hereof, there are 101.890,199 Orex shares issued and outstanding, and 
the daily closing share trading prices over the past three months ranged from $0.165 to $0.270 
(with the closing price of $0.18 per share on July 23rd, 2015). The high and low prices over the 
past year were $0.430 and $0.135, respectively. As at April 30, 2015, Orex had $7.591 million in 
working  capital. Taking  account  the  receipt  of  US$6.0  million  from  Agnico  Eagle  (see  next
C-10
paragraph)  as  well  as  ongoing  expenditures,  the  current  working  capital  is  estimated  to  be 
approximately $6.0 million.
Orex’s major properties consist of its interests in Barsele gold project in Sweden, and the Coneto 
and Los Crestones silver-gold projects in Mexico. The Company also owns 100% of the Jumping 
Josephine project in British Columbia. Regarding Barsele, Orex received an NI 43-101 compliant 
resource estimate (based on a cut-off of 0.6 grams of gold per tonne) in May of 2014 that defined 
547,000 ounces of gold in the indicated category (14.1 million tonnes grading 1.21 g/t gold) and 
627,000 ounces of gold in the inferred category (20.2 million tonnes grading 0.97 g/t gold). On 
June 11, 2015, Orex announced that it had closed the joint venture transaction with Agnico Eagle 
that  was  previously  announced  on  February  23,  2015  (the  “Transaction”).  Pursuant  to  the 
Transaction, Agnico Eagle, through its indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary Agnico Eagle Sweden 
AB (“AE Sweden”), acquired a 55% interest in Gunnarn Mining A.B. (“Gunnarn”), the corporate 
entity which owns the Barsele Project, in consideration of an initial payment to Orex of US$6.0
million. An additional US$2.0 million will be payable by AE Sweden, or by Agnico Eagle on AE 
Sweden’s behalf, to Orex in cash or common shares of Agnico Eagle at AE Sweden’s election on 
each of the first and second anniversaries of the closing of the Transaction. AE Sweden has also 
committed to spend US$7.0 million on Barsele Project expenditures over three years. In addition, 
if  Agnico  Eagle  or  AE  Sweden  prepares  a  pre-feasibility  study  on  the  Barsele  Project  and
contributes  it  to  Gunnarn,  AE  Sweden's  interest  in  Gunnarn  will  increase  to  70%  and  Orex's 
interest in Gunnarn will be reduced to 30%. If Agnico Eagle decides to prepare a pre-feasibility 
study, until such pre-feasibility study is contributed to Gunnarn by Agnico Eagle or AE Sweden, 
all  costs  and  expenses  of  Gunnarn  will  be  for  the  account  of  AE  Sweden  and,  following  the 
completion of such pre-feasibility study, all costs and expenses of Gunnarn will be shared by the 
AE Sweden and Orex in accordance with their proportionate interest in Gunnarn. Regarding the 
Coneto project, Orex signed an association agreement with Fresnillo PLC (“Fresnillo”) whereby 
the Orex and Fresnillo properties in the area were ‘consolidated’, and Fresnillo has the option to 
incur  substantial  exploration  expenditures  in  order  to  earn  interests  in  the  combined  property 
varying from 55% to 70% (spending US$6.0 million over three years to earn 55%, and spending 
up to an additional $21.0 million to increase its interest to 70%). Fresnillo is also Orex’s second 
largest  shareholder.  The  Los  Crestones  property,  100%  owned  by  Orex, hosts  numerous 
mineralized  showings  and  small-scale  workings,  and  is  considered  prospective  for  vein  and 
breccia-hosted  low-sulphidation  epithermal  gold  and  silver.  On  the  Jumping  Josephine  project 
(now  owned  100%  by  Orex),  drilling  to  date  has  identified  an  NI  43-101  compliant  resource 
estimate  (at  a  cut-off  grade  of  0.5  g/t  gold)  that  has  defined  34,000  ounces  of  gold  (363,000 
tonnes  grading  2.95  g/t  gold)  in  the  indicated  category  and  30,000  ounces  (448,000  tonnes 
grading 2.08 g/t gold) in the inferred category.
Barsele Project4
The Barsele Project is located approximately 20 kilometers (“km”) east-southeast of the town of 
Storuman in Västerbottens Län (County), Sweden, which is approximately 800 kilometers north

of  Stockholm.  The  largest  regional  centre  is  Umeå,  population  105,000,  the  administrative 
headquarters of Västerbottens County, located roughly 210 km from the project site.
On  October  27,  2010,  Orex  signed  a  letter  of  intent  with Northland  Exploration  Sweden  AB 
(previously  named Barsele  Guld AB)  (“Northland”), a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  Northland 
Resources  S.E.  (previously  named  Northland  Resources  S.A.),  to  earn  100%  interest  in  the 
Barsele Project subject to certain terms. Orex and Northland entered into a share sale agreement 
dated  March  22,  2011  (the  “Barsele  Agreement”),  whereby,  among  other  things,  Orex  was  to 
acquire 100% ownership of Gunnarn, the owner of the claims comprising the Barsele Project.. On 
October  1,  2013,  Orex  entered  into  an  agreement  (the  “Amended  Barsele  Agreement”)  with 
Northland  to  amend  the  Barsele  Agreement.  Under  the  terms  of  the  Amended  Barsele 
Agreement, Orex satisfied the remaining cash payments to be made to Northland by the payment 
of US$250,000 in cash and the issuance of 7.5 million Orex Shares at a deemed price of US$0.50 
per  Orex  Share.  Northland  had  the  right  to  receive  certain  NSR  royalties  (the  “Northland 
Royalties”) pursuant to three royalty agreements between Northland and Gunnarn dated October 
16, 2007 (collectively, the “Northland Royalty Agreements”), the terms of which were amended 
by  an  option  agreement  (the  “Northland  Option  Agreement”)  dated  April  29,  2011  between 
Northland, Orex and Gunnarn. On September 15, 2014, Northland and Gunnarn mutually agreed 
to  terminate  the  Northland  Royalty  Agreements  and  the  Northland  Option  Agreement  and  to 
transfer  all  rights  of  Northland  to  the  Northland  Royalties  to  Gunnarn  in  consideration  for a
payment of US$500,000 to Northland by Gunnarn.
On June 11, 2015, Orex announced that they had closed the Transaction with Agnico Eagle that 
was  previously  announced  on  February  23,  2015.  Pursuant  to  the  Transaction,  Agnico  Eagle, 
through its indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary AE Sweden, acquired a 55% interest in Gunnarn, 
the  corporate  entity  which  owns  the  Barsele  Project,  in  consideration  of  an  initial  payment  to 
Orex  of  US$6.0  million.  An  additional  US$2.0  million  will  be  payable  by  AE  Sweden,  or  by 
Agnico Eagle on AE Sweden’s behalf, to Orex in cash or common shares of Agnico Eagle at AE 
Sweden’s election on each of the first and second anniversaries of the closing of the Transaction. 
AE  Sweden  has  also  committed  to  spend  US$7.0 million  on  Project  expenditures  over  three 
years.  If AE  Sweden  or  Agnico  Eagle  prepares  a  pre-feasibility  study  on  the  Project  and 
contributes  it  to  Gunnarn,  AE  Sweden’s  interest  in  Gunnarn  will  increase  to  70%  and  Orex’s 
interest  in  Gunnarn  will  be  reduced  to  30%.  AE  Sweden  is  the  operator  of  the  Project  for 
customary compensation, and has a majority of seats on Gunnarn’s board of directors. Pursuant 
to  the  Transaction,  Orex  was  also  granted  a  2%  NSR  royalty  on  production  from  the  Project, 
which may be repurchased by Agnico Eagle at any time for US$5.0 million.
Approximately  20%  of  the  former  total  of  32,000  hectares  of  mineral  exploration  concessions 
have fallen into abeyance, although the main deposit areas have been retained. Effectively, this 
means several of the concessions have expired, but after one year the Company can apply to re-
acquire the concessions, and would get preferential treatment in doing so.
The Barsele Project area is located within a Proterozoic portion of the Fennoscandian Shield, in a 
boundary region between Bothnian metasediments to the south and metavolcanics to the north. It 
is situated in an island arc environment considered favourable for VMS style deposits. Because of 
a wide-spread thin cover of glacial till, geological interpretations and correlations rely heavily on 
drill  holes,  trenches,  limited  outcrops  and  geophysics.  The  Proterozoic  metasediments  and 
metavolcanics  which  underlie  the  property  have  been  intruded  by  three  phases  of  granitic 
intrusions, one of which is the host of the Barsele gold mineralization.
C-12
Gold mineralization at Barsele occurs in three main zones which are predominantly hosted within 
a medium-grained, highly fractured granodiorite that ranges in width from 200 to 500 meters with 
a strike extent in excess of some eight kilometers. There are two main types of mineralization, (a) 
low  to  moderate  grade  gold  mineralization  associated  with  networks  of  thin  tourmaline-quartz 
and quartz-calcite-arsenopyrite veinlets in granodiorite, and (b) high grade gold-silver-zinc-lead 
mineralization in syn-tectonic quartz-sulphide veins.
The history of mineral exploration in the Barsele Project area goes back to regional geochemical 
till sampling programs conducted by Terra Mining in the 1980s, which were followed up by basal 
till  sampling  in  anomalous  areas.  This  work,  plus  airborne  and  ground  geophysics  (EM  plus 
magnetometer), trenching and drilling, led to the discovery of the first gold zone at Barsele. Terra 
Mining worked on the project until 1998 and completed more than 28,876 meters of diamond and 
RC drilling, partially delineated three main zones and two minor ones, completed metallurgical 
testing,  and  prepared  a  resource  estimate.  The  project  was  then  sequentially  held  by  William 
Mining  Ltd.  and  MinMet  from  1998  to  2004,  who  completed  more  drilling  and  geophysics. 
Northland optioned the project in 2004 and completed nearly 5,000 meters more diamond drilling 
in 30 holes and prepared two more resource estimates, before the project was optioned by Orex in 
2011.
After completing the initial phase of  ground  geophysics in November 2011, Orex commenced 
diamond drilling to test both the strike extensions and depth potential of the deposits outlined to 
date. In this first phase of drilling, 16 holes were completed, with 12 in the Central Zone and 4 in 
the Avan Zone. The assay results from the Central Zone expanded the boundaries of the known 
mineralization, both laterally and vertically.
An  independently  verified  mineral  resource  estimate  was  completed  on  the  Barsele  Project  by 
Gary  Giroux,  P.  Eng.,  MASc.,  Giroux  Consultants Ltd.,  in  November  2012.  The  resource 
estimate for the three main zones included in the Giroux Technical Report is summarized in the 
following table.

In addition to the above resource, there is a minor Au-Ag-Cu-Zn resource of less than 0.5 million 
tonnes in all categories, in the Norra VMS Zone.
The total of all work completed to date on the project includes almost 49,000 meters of drilling 
(414  diamond  drill  holes),  approximately  16,000  till,  basal  till,  and  rock  chip  samples,  six

airborne  and  ground  geophysical  surveys,  geological  mapping, 
trenching,  metallurgy, 
environmental  baseline  studies  and  several  resource  estimates.  Technical  work  on  the  project 
over  the  past  year  has  been  restricted  to  environmental  testing  and  surface  prospecting  and 
sampling. No further exploratory drilling has been conducted.
Coneto Gold-Silver Project5
The Coneto Gold-Silver Project is located near  the town of Coneto de  Comonfort in Durango 
State, northern Mexico, approximately 110 km north of the city of Durango. The historic Coneto 
Mining District is situated in the heart of the “Mexican Silver Trend”, stretching from Guanajuato 
in  the  southeast,  through  the  states  of  Zacatecas  and  Durango.  The  trend  hosts  some  of  the 
world’s largest silver deposits, including Fresnillo, Guanajuato,  La Pitarrilla, Real de Angeles, 
and Zacatecas mining camps.
In  2009,  Orex  purchased  seven  mineral  concessions  comprising  3,300  hectares  from  several 
vendors to consolidate the disparate holdings into one block. Since then (in late 2009 and early 
2010) Orex was granted, upon application, two more exploration concessions (Lomas 3 and 4) to 
bring the total area of its mineral holdings in the area up to approximately 16,300 hectares.
The original concessions purchase was made by the issuance of shares in Orex to the vendors, 
and  the  vendors  retaining  a  2.5%  NSR  royalty,  of  which  1%  can  be  purchased  for  US  $1.0 
million.  Orex  has  also  negotiated  surface  access  agreements  with  eight  community  groups 
including  two  “Ejido”  (land  collective)  Councils  and  six  “Bienes  Comunales”  (community 
goods) groups. On February 2, 2012, Orex announced it had signed an Association Agreement 
with Fresnillo PLC. to jointly explore their mineral holdings in the Coneto  gold-silver mining 
district. The Association Agreement, which covers approximately 17,600 hectares, is summarized 
below:
(cid:120) Fresnillo  will  spend  a  minimum  of  US$2.0 million  during  the  first  year,  of  which  a
minimum of 70% must be on Orex’s concessions;
(cid:120) Fresnillo will have the option to spend an additional US$2.0 million per year for each of
the following two years, with a minimum of 70% on Orex’s concessions;
(cid:120) When  Fresnillo  reaches  US$6.0 million  in  expenditures,  the  two  companies  will  each 
contribute  their  respective  Coneto  concessions  into  a  new  company  (“NewCo”)  which 
will be owned 55:45 by Fresnillo and Orex;
(cid:120) Fresnillo will have the right to increase its ownership of NewCo to 70% by completing a
prefeasibility study (“PFS”) or by spending US$21.0 million in advancing a PFS; 
If Fresnillo chooses not to increase its ownership to 70%, the two companies will share 
the costs of completing a PFS in the ratio 55:45;
(cid:120) Additional  funding  required  by  NewCo  will  be  contributed  in  proportion  to  the  two
(cid:120)
companies’ respective ownership interests;
5 Much of the material in this section of the Fairness Opinion has come from technical reports. The first is entitled 
“Technical Report For The Coneto Silver-Gold Project, Durango, Mexico” prepared for Orex Minerals Inc. by Ben 
Whiting, P. Geo., and David Gunning, P. Eng., dated 30 November 2009 and revised 15 March 2010. The second 
report is entitled  “Summary  Report of the Phase-I Diamond Drilling Program on  the  Coneto Gold-Silver Project, 
Durango, Mexico”, prepared for Orex Minerals Inc. by Ben Whiting, P. Geo., and Ing. Miguel Davila C., and dated 
30 December 2010. In addition, an internal updated report was prepared by Ben Whiting in early April 2014.
C-14
(cid:120) Fresnillo will have the right of first refusal to acquire Orex’s interest in NewCo if Orex
has received an offer for its interest which it intends to accept; and
(cid:120) Fresnillo will have the right of first refusal to acquire any additional mineral property in 
Mexico  which  Orex  has  acquired  during  the  life  of  the  Association  Agreement  and 
subsequently intends to sell or option.
Phase  I  drilling  (5,000  meters  over  21  holes)  was  conducted  in  2010  by  Orex  prior  to  the 
Fresnillo agreement. To date, Fresnillo has expended an estimated US$6.0 million on exploring 
the  property (including  23,742 meters of  drilling in  61  holes  in  Phases  II  to  III),  and  has 
commenced  a  Phase-IV  program  of  approximately  4,500  meters (see  April  22,  2015  news 
release). The first three phases of drilling targeted multiple mineralized structures throughout the 
Coneto  Mining  District.  This  fourth  phase  is  intended  to  test  down  dip  and  along  strike  from 
gold-silver  intercept  on  the  La  Bufa,  Santo  Nino,  Loma  Verde,  Impulsora,  Durazno,  and 
Promontorio structures in about 100 meter step-outs.
The Santo Nino, La Bufa, Loma Verde, Durazno, and Impulsora are steeply-dipping, sub parallel
epithermal quartz veins. Promontorio is a quartz-hematite stockwork zone, with veining. These 
structures are hosted in Tertiary andesites of the Lower Volcanic Sequence, exposed in a window 
below  the  Upper  Volcanic  Sequence  rhyolites.  Veins  are  in  a  northwest  oriented  corridor 
extending for over 17 kilometers.
The Coneto region has a long history of prospecting and small scale mining going back over 400 
years. Coneto is centrally located in the Mexican Silver Trend on the eastern side of the Sierra 
Madre  Occidental  Mountains  in  an  area  which  has  more  than  40  known  historic  gold-silver 
producers and prospects. Documented mining and smelting by the Spanish in the Coneto district 
began  in  1572,  but  was  discontinued  in  1790  due  to  the  inability  to  handle  water  in  the  mine 
workings. More attempts to dewater and mine began in the late 1800s but were interrupted by the 
Mexican Revolution in 1910. In the mid to late 20th century, a North American company installed 
a flotation mill which operated until 1973, with a new Mexican operator resuming activities from 
1976 to 1990, although production records are mostly unavailable. During the 1970s and 1980s 
the Consejo de Recursos Minerales (“CRM”) completed considerable underground development 
and drilling.
During  the  1990s  and  2000s,  several  Mexican  and  Canadian  groups  conducted  limited 
exploration  on  the  project,  and  one  conducted  a  cyanidation  test  of  one  style  of  Coneto 
mineralization. The results were considered encouraging because, without any optimization, they 
achieved 85% silver recovery and 60% gold recovery.
Since Orex’s purchase in 2009, it has conducted detailed geological mapping and geochemical 
sampling  programs  and  completed  5,000  metres  of  diamond  drilling  in  21  holes  -  testing  six 
targets.  After  signing  the  Association  Agreement  with  Fresnillo  in  February  2012, a  Phase-II
12,000 metre diamond drill program was subsequently completed. A Phase III program of 11,744 
meters of diamond drilling in 30 holes was completed in 2014. The current Phase IV program, 
consisting  of  4,600  meters  in  11  diamond  drill  holes,  will  be  completed  in  2015.  In  total,  93
diamond drill holes will have been completed, for 33,343 meters of core drilling.
The  Coneto  gold-silver  project  is  located  in  a  geological  sub-province  known  as  the  “Mesa 
Central”, on the eastern flank of the Sierra Madre Occidental Mountains. The Mesa Central sub-
province  is  a  volcanic-sedimentary  highland  composed  of  mainly  Tertiary  to  Quaternary
C-15
sequences of andesite, rhyo-dacite and basalt, which in turn rest on a basement of Cretaceous and 
older  calcareous  and  metasedimentary  rocks.  The  Paleocene-Eocene  Lower  Volcanic  Unit  of 
andesitic tuffs, flows and agglomerate make up the main rocks exposed on the Coneto property 
and  in  the  underground  workings.  The  Cretaceous  basement  rocks  include  shale,  mudstone, 
limestone and a polylithic conglomerate containing volcanic, sedimentary and limestone clasts. 
The conglomerate units appear to have an association with some of the overlying mining camps 
in the region.
The Coneto mining camp is characterized by mineralization of the intermediate sulphidation style 
of epithermal vein emplacement. There is a broad zone of veining and associated hydrothermal 
alteration which extends approximately 15 km in a mainly northwest-southeast direction, with a 
width of up to four km, across multiple veins. There are over 40 documented veins in the camp, 
which  are  braided  and  splayed  off  one  another,  and  over  12  have  been  named  and  have  had 
historic mining operations on them. Some individual veins have been mapped for over two km 
along strike, and vary in thickness from one to twenty meters. Testing on most veins has not been 
extended beyond 100 meters down-dip.
The first two phases of diamond drilling (17,000 meters over 52 holes) conducted by Orex and 
Fresnillo obtained significant intersections across many of the known veins. The importance of 
the Phase-II drilling confirmed mineralization in the Loma Verde, Impulsora, Descubridora and 
La Bufa structures, but also highlighted the importance of deeper drilling with a spectacular “hit” 
on the Santo Niño structure almost 400 meters down-hole. This intercept is interpreted to be in 
the “boiling zone” of an epithermal vein system. Hole BCO-11 intercepted at a depth of 395.40 to 
398.70 for 3.30 meters (2.70 meters true thickness) Au 4.34 g/t, Ag 612 g/t for a gold-equivalent 
of 16.00 g/t, or a silver-equivalent of 840 g/t (excluding base metal values). Base metals in the 
same intercept yielded Cu 0.16 %, Pb 0.28 % and Zn 0.42 % for a base metal only Zn-Equivalent 
of 1.24 %.
Trench channel sampling was conducted on multiple veins. In particular, the Impulsora structure 
was expanded to over 1.6 kilometers strike length on which 69 channels exceeded 100 g/t silver-
equivalent. The Loma Verde and Santo Nino structures also yielded significant gold and silver 
values. Some of the selected trenching results are set out below:

Reconnaissance drilling over the first two phases on the Coneto project has yielded intercepts in 
six mineralized structures, including Loma Verde, Impulsoro, La Bufa, Santo Nino, Sauces, and 
Descubridora,  identifying  them  as  targets  for  delineation  drilling.  Hole  BCO-17  in  the
C-16
Descubridora  vein  yielded  an  intercept  of  core  length  of  6.45  meters  (true  width  4.84  meters) 
grading 153 gpt silver and 0.71 gpt gold, for a gold equivalent of 3.49 gpt (55:1 gold to silver 
value), or silver equivalent of 192 gpt. Hole BCO-28 in the Impulsora vein yielded an intercept of 
core length of 7.60 meters (true width 4.56 meters) grading 2.04 gpt gold and 12.3 gpt silver, for 
a gold equivalent of 2.27 gpt gold, or silver equivalent of 125 gpt.
The results from the Phase III diamond drilling (11,700 meters over 30 holes) in the Promontorio, 
Impulsora, Loma Verde, La Bufa, and Central areas. Results were announced in news releases 
dated  October  7th,  November  18th,  and  December  8th,  2014,  with  some  of  the better results
summarized below:
Santo Nino:        4.45 m (3.4 m true width) of 179 gpt silver-equivalent (at 60:1 Au/Ag ratio) 
   Promontorio:      4.15 m (3.9 m true width) of 181 gpt silver-equivalent (at 60:1 Au/Ag ratio) 
   Impulsora:          4.05 m (3.1 m true width) of 129 gpt silver-equivalent (at 60:1 Au/Ag ratio) 
   Descubridora:     5.85 m (4.5 m true width) of 103 gpt silver-equivalent (at 60:1 Au/Ag ratio) 
   Loma Verde:       4.85 m (4.2 m true width) of 201 gpt silver-equivalent (at 60:1 Au/Ag ratio) 
   Promontorio       6.45 m (5.6 m true width) of 236 gpt silver-equivalent (at 60:1 Au/Ag ratio)
The Santo Nino, Bufa, and Bufa-Alta are steeply-dipping, sub parallel epithermal veins in the La 
Bufa  Zone,  3.0  kilometers  northwest  of  the  village  of  Coneto  de  Comonfort.  Reliz  is  a 
mineralized  dyke  in  the  La  Bufa  Zone.  Loma  Verde  and  Gambusino  are  epithermal  veins  1.0 
kilometers  to  the  west  of  the  village.  Impulsora,  Descubridora,  Indio,  Imtermedia,  La  Isla, 
Nogales,  Palma,  Santa  Teresa,  and  Sauce  are  steep  epithermal  veins  extending  for  over  6.0 
kilometers  southeast  of  the  village.  Promontorio  is  a  quartz-hematite  stockwork  and  veining 
structure  4.0  kilometers  to  the  southeast  of  the  village.  There  are  also  andesite  breccia  and 
veinlets zones in unnamed structures.
While no formal NI 43-101 compliant technical report on resource estimates has been published 
to date, there is sufficient diamond drilling to start the process. As a result, it is expected that 
Fresnillo will prepare a resource before the end of 2015.
Regarding future expenditures beyond the US$6.0 million required for Fresnillo to earn 55%, it is 
not certain whether Fresnillo will elect to form a 55%/45% (Fresnillo/Orex) joint venture, or sole-
fund  expenditures  with  a  view  to  ultimately  completing  a  pre-feasibility  study  or  spending 
US$21.0 million in advancing a pre-feasibility study to earn an additional 15% - to a total interest 
of 70%.
Los Crestones Property6
The Los Crestones Property is a gold-silver-copper property located in the gold-silver belt of the 
Sierra Madre Occidental of Sinaloa State, Mexico, approximately 110 km from the state capital 
of Culiacán. It is accessed by federal and state highways to the town of Surutato, and then on a 
narrow dirt road to the nearby village of Plan Grande, with final access currently by ATV quads 
or  on  foot.  The  property  is  comprised  of  three  contiguous  claims  with  a  total  area  of  4,168

hectares, and was optioned by Astral Mining Corporation (“Astral”), which was acquired by Orex 
in early 2013, from local parties in January 2011.
Although  there  is  evidence  of  considerable  historic  exploration  and  sampling  on  the  property, 
there is no documentation of activity until the staking of the property by members of two local 
families  in  2009.  Those  families  conducted  some  sampling,  and  hosted  visits  by  interested 
exploration  groups  who  carried  out  sampling  and  prospecting  programs  until  Astral7 became 
involved in late 2010. On January 11, 2011, Astral’s wholly-owned Mexican subsidiary signed an 
option agreement with the two families, which provided that Astral could acquire a 100% interest 
in the property by making staged payments totaling US$750,000 to the vendors over a five year 
period. The vendors retained a 0.5% NSR royalty which can be purchased by Orex at any time 
for  US  $400,000.  In  addition,  Orex  has  been  in  negotiations  with  two  local  Ejidos  (local 
agricultural cooperatives) and agreed to make scheduled payments to the Ejidos and provide a 
0.5%  NSR  royalty  from  the  property  to  be  shared  by  the  two  Ejidos  should  it  ever  go  into 
production.
The  Los  Crestones  Property  is  located  in  the  western  portion  of  the  Sierra  Madre  Occidental  
geological province, which is a 1,500 km long, northwest-trending, belt of volcanic rocks proven 
to  host  numerous  economic,  low  and  high  sulphidation-style,  epithermal  Au-Ag  deposits  and 
mineralized porphyry systems in Mexico.
The Sierra Madre belt contains upper and lower volcanic units which unconformably overlie a 
highly  deformed  Carboniferous-age  sedimentary  basement. The  lower  volcanic  unit  is  of  late 
Cretaceous to Eocene age and characterized by andesitic and dacitic volcanic rocks with minor 
rhyolite,  and  associated  with  diorite,  granodiorite  and  monzonite  intrusive  phases.  The  upper 
volcanics are characterized by basal conglomerates and intermediate to felsic volcanics, which 
are thought to be Oligocene in age, and were deposited unconformably on the lower volcanics. 
Much of the exploration work has focused on the contact between the upper and lower volcanics 
because this horizon has been a favourable zone for the discovery of economic mineralization in 
western Mexico.
In detail, the property is mainly underlain by granodiorites and monzonites, which have intruded 
the  older  andesites.  North-south  trending  rhyolite  dykes  are  also  prevalent.  The  mineralized 
structures are narrow, north-south trending zones which are composed of highly silicified, healed 
brittle  fractures  of  intrusive  breccias.  They  are  relatively  resistant  to  erosion  and  stand  up  as 
prominent ridges or “(cid:70)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:553)(cid:81)(cid:86)”, hence the property name. The three most prominent of them have 
been named Corona, Bohemia and Indio.
The mineralization is considered by Orex to be low-intermediate sulphidation epithermal style, 
and  appears  to  occur  preferentially  in  brecciated  andesites  of  the  lower  volcanics.  Minerals 
include chalcopyrite, bornite, pyrite, silver sulphosalts, and specular hematite, while the alteration 
includes the hematite plus epidote, chlorite, goethite, and limonite.
The work on the property by Orex has included mapping, prospecting, soil geochemistry, rock 
sampling,  and  2,618  meters  of  diamond  drilling  in  18  holes.  In  the  prospecting  and  rock 
sampling, they have identified and sampled more than 20 showings and obtained more than 20 
samples assaying higher than 0.5 ppm (or 0.5 g/t) gold. Some of the best drill intersections in

In addition, assay results have been received from samples which had been sent to the laboratory 
by the previous operator, Astral Mining, but had not been analyzed. Hole 11LD014 included a 
further 0.45 meters grading Au 45.8 g/t, Ag 87 g/t (Au-Eq 47.4 g/t or Ag-Eq 2,606 g/t), plus Cu 
2.41 %.  Hole 11LD011 returned 1.50 meters grading Au 5.79 g/t.
The Los Crestones Gold-Copper-Silver Project has undergone an active geological mapping and 
sampling  program. A  property-wide  helicopter  airborne  magnetic  and  radiometric  geophysical 
survey  was  flow  by  MPX  Geoservices  Ltd.  in  April  to  May  2014.  A  follow-up  ground 
geophysical  survey,  consisting  of  18-line-kilometers  of  Induced  Polarization  (“IP”)  and 
Magnetotellurics was conducted by Quantec Goescience Ltd. in July to August 2014. A Phase II 
diamond drilling program, planned for 5,000 meters, commenced in late 2014, and continued into 
2015. Due to some unexpected results in a particular part of the property, only 2,500 meters of 
drilling was completed.
Jumping Josephine Property8
The Jumping Josephine  Property  (“JJ Property”) is located in southern  British Columbia, near 
Castlegar in the West Kootenay Region. The JJ Property consists of 24 mineral claims and seven 
crown  grants and  was owned  60% by  Astral  and  40%  by  Kootenay  Gold. Orex  has  recently 
obtained Kootenay’s 40% interest9, such that Orex now owns 100% of the project.
The  JJ  Property  is  underlain  by  Middle  Jurassic  granitic  rocks,  related  to  the  Nelson  plutonic 
suite, which have intruded metavolcanic/sedimentary rocks of the Late Paleozoic Mount Roberts 
Formation. The Coryell Alkaline intrusive rocks, generally surround the Nelson plutonic rocks 
and are exposed along the north, west and south side of the JJ Property as numerous small stocks 
and dykes.
The  mineralization  on  the  JJ  Property  Main  Zone consists  of  quartz  veins  and  silicified  shear 
zones; the quartz stockwork veins of the main prospect show a close association between gold

mineralization and sulphides. The sulphide mineralization is mainly comprised of arsenopyrite, 
along  with  minor  pyrite,  chalcopyrite,  sphalerite  and  galena.  Sulphides  within  the  veins  are 
generally coarse-grained and make up less than 10% of the vein material. The monzonitic wall 
rocks  hosting  the  veins  commonly  exhibit  chlorite  and  sericite  alteration  with  minor  finely 
disseminated pyrite.
Exploration on the JJ Property  was conducted by  Orex and predecessor  property owners from 
2003  to  2011.  In  addition  to  drilling,  mapping,  trenching,  geochemistry  and  geophysics,  Orex
contracted  some  preliminary  metallurgical  testing  work,  which  indicated  that  the  gold 
mineralization appeared amenable to recovery using gravity concentration plus cyanide leaching. 
A number of gold showings were discovered in the early work, which led to detailed follow-up 
work and diamond drilling totaling nearly 25,000 m over 197 holes. In 2011, Apex Geoscience
Ltd completed a NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate on the main zone based on 71 diamond 
drill holes, with hole spacings averaging 20-40 meters, and a composite of 564 one-meter core 
samples. The results of the resource estimate (at a cut-off grade of 0.5 gpt gold) are summarized

Apex  has  recommended  considerable  follow-up  work  to  test  other  targets,  as  well  as  more 
drilling  and  trenching  followed  by  bulk  sampling  on  the  main  zone,  and  the  preparation  of  a 
scoping  study  assessment.  Orex (and/or  Astral)  has  expended  over  $5.0 million on  the  JJ 
Property. A 2014-2015 diamond drilling program was conducted for 8,115 meters in 25 holes, 
utilizing the $1.3 million flow-through financing raised by Orex in late 2013. The JJ Property is 
currently under review.
Working Capital and Other Assets
As at April 30, 2015, Orex had $7.591 million in working capital. Taking account the receipt of 
US$6.0 million from Agnico Eagle as well as ongoing expenditures, the current working capital 
is estimated to be approximately $6.0 million.
Orex also has income tax pools that, in certain situations, may be utilized to reduce future taxable 
income, and thereby reduce income taxes to be paid. These include non-capital losses of about 
$20.0 million, plus exploration and evaluation assets of around $8.0 million. In addition, Orex 
has a TSX-V listing. For purposes of this valuation, Glanville and McKnight have not added any 
specific additional value for the tax pools and TSX-V listing, since these are not material.
Fairness Opinions and Valuations (CIMVal Standards)
The  TSX-V  requires  that  CIMVal  Standards  (Canadian  Institute  of  Mining,  Metallurgy  and 
Petroleum Standards and Guidelines for Valuations of Mineral Properties) be used by issuers and 
their  professional  advisors  when  preparing  formal  valuations  and  valuation  reports  on  mineral 
properties. The CIMVal Standards are limited to valuations of mineral properties (including any
C-20
interests  therein),  and  do  not  apply  to  fairness  opinions  or  valuations  of  corporations  or  other 
entities  that  hold  mineral  properties  as  assets.  As  a  result,  the  CIMVal  standards  are  not 
applicable  to  this  Fairness  Opinion,  although  McKnight  and  Glanville  are  familiar  with  the 
CIMVal Standards and have applied them where appropriate.
It should be emphasized that this Fairness Opinion is not a technical report nor a formal valuation 
as  defined  in  The  Canadian  Institute  of  Mining,  Metallurgy  and  Petroleum  publication  of 
February  2003,  and  amended  December  2005,  “Standards  and  Guidelines  for  Valuation  of 
Mineral Properties” (CIMVal Standards and Guidelines).
Valuations of Non-Producing Mineral Properties
In  the  case  of  valuations  of  interests  in  mineral  properties  which  are  not  at  the  production, 
feasibility or preliminary economic assessment stage, discounted cash flow methods may not be 
used. As a result, other methods must be employed, including comparables (such as values per in-
situ ounce of gold), option or joint venture terms, adjusted appraised value (derived from book
value or prior expenditures), planned exploration expenditures, and values of similar properties
(including dollars-per-hectare comparisons).
Barsele Valuation
Glanville  and  McKnight  have  estimate  the  value  of  100%  of  the  Barsele  Project  based  on  two 
different  methods,  those  being  the  recent  transaction with  Agnico  Eagle  and  dollars-per-ounce  of 
contained gold in resources for similar projects.
Agreement with Agnico Eagle
On June 11, 2015, Orex announced that they had closed the Transaction with Agnico Eagle that 
was  previously  announced  on  February  23,  2015.  Pursuant  to  the  Transaction,  Agnico  Eagle, 
through its indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary AE Sweden, acquired a 55% interest in Gunnarn, 
the  corporate  entity  which  owns  the  Barsele  Project,  in  consideration  of  an  initial  payment  to 
Orex  of  US$6.0  million.  An  additional  US$2.0  million  will  be  payable  by  AE  Sweden,  or  by 
Agnico Eagle on AE Sweden’s behalf, to Orex in cash or common shares of Agnico Eagle at AE 
Sweden’s election on each of the first and second anniversaries of the closing of the Transaction. 
AE  Sweden  has  also  committed  to  spend  US$7.0 million  on  Project  expenditures  over  three 
years.  If  AE  Sweden  or  Agnico  Eagle  prepares  a  pre-feasibility  study  on  the  Project  and 
contributes  it  to  Gunnarn,  AE  Sweden’s  interest  in  Gunnarn  will  increase  to  70%  and  Orex’s 
interest  in  Gunnarn  will  be  reduced  to  30%.  AE  Sweden  is  the  operator  of  the  Project  for 
customary compensation, and has a majority of seats on Gunnarn’s board of directors. Pursuant 
to  the  Transaction,  Orex  was  also  granted  a  2%  NSR  royalty  on  production  from  the  Project, 
which may be repurchased by Agnico Eagle at any time for US$5.0 million.
Based on the foregoing deal, Glanville and McKnight calculated the implied value of 100% of 
Barsele under two different scenarios, or assumptions, those being as follows:
1. Assuming that Agnico Eagle only carries out its minimum commitment of US$7.0 million 
on exploration (but does not complete a pre-feasibility study), meaning that Agnico Eagle
would have earned a 55% interest in Barsele.
C-21
2. Assuming that Agnico Eagle carries out its minimum commitments plus US$20.0 million 
to complete a pre-feasibility study, meaning that Agnico would have earned a 70% interest 
in Barsele by incurring total exploration expenditures of US$27.0 million.
It should be noted that Orex will retain a 2% NSR on the project, which is equivalent to about a 
10% equity interest (working interest) in the project10. Thus, the net interest being acquired by 
Agnico Eagle is only about 90% of the stated interests being acquired (55% in assumption #1 
above, and 70% in assumptions #2 and #3 above).
The calculations for assumption #1 above are set out below:
Canadian Dollars
US$6.0 million paid:
                                      $7.5 million 
       US$4.0 million to be paid11:                                                                     4.5 million
       US$6.0 million12 x 45% carried x 90% = US$2.43                                  3.2 million   
                        $15.2 million
Total cost to Agnico Eagle:
Since Agnico Eagle would only be acquiring a net interest of 55% x 90% (due to the 2% NSR to 
be retained by Orex), or 49.5%, the implied value of 100% of Barsele (with no royalty) would be 
Cdn$30.7 million ($15.2 million divided by 49.5%).
The calculations for assumption #2 above are set out below:
Canadian Dollars
US$6.0 million paid:                                                                               $7.5 million 
       US$4.0 million to be paid13:
                             4.5 million
       US$18.8 million14 x 30% carried x 90% = US$5.08 million                    6.6 million  
Total cost to Agnico Eagle:                                                                   $18.6 million
Since Agnico Eagle would be acquiring a net interest of 70% x 90% (due to the 2% NSR to be 
retained by Orex), or 63.0%, the implied value of 100% of Barsele (with no royalty) would be 
Cdn$29.5 million ($18.6 million divided by 63.0%).
Based  on  the  foregoing two  alternatives,  the  implied  value  of  100%  of  Barsele  would  be 
approximately Cdn$30 million (the average of the values determined for the two assumptions is 
$30.1 million).
10 This is based on assessments of many royalty interests sold, as well as the implied value of same based on market 
capitalizations of a number of royalty companies (adjusted for size).
11 Payments are US$2.0 million in one year, and US$2.0 million in two years. The discounted present value of the 
foregoing is approximately US$3.5 million (at a 10% discount rate), or Cdn $4.5 million.
12 This assumes that US$2.0 million will be spent on exploration in each of the next two years, and US$3.0 million in 
the third year. The present value of these total expenditures of US$7.0 million would be about US$6.0 million, or 
Cdn$7.8 million.
13 Payments are US$2.0 million in one year, and US$2.0 million in two years. The discounted present value of the 
foregoing is approximately US$3.5 million (at a 10% discount rate), or Cdn $4.5 million.
14 This assumes that US$2.0 million will be spent on exploration in each of the next two years, US$3.0 million in the 
third year, US$5.0 million in each of the next two years, and US$10.0 million (total of US$27.0 million). The present 
value of these total expenditures of US$27.0 million would be about US$18.8 million, or Cdn$24.4 million.

Dollars Per Ounce
Glanville  and  McKnight  have  examined  the  stock  market  trading  performance  of  many  gold 
exploration, development, and production companies, as well as the terms of purchases of several 
similar  exploration,  development,  and  production  projects,  and  have  examined  the  adjusted 
market  capitalizations  per  ounce  of  in-situ  metals  for  active  exploration  and  development 
companies.  As  would  be  expected,  the  ranges  in  adjusted  market  capitalizations  and  purchase 
prices per in-situ quantities are reasonably wide, since the prices depend upon a variety of factors, 
including  the  stage  of  advancement  (early  stage  exploration,  ‘potential  resources’,  historic 
resources,  inferred  resources,  drill-indicated  resources,  proven  reserves,  production  from  one 
operation,  or  a  multi-mine  company,  for  example),  the  depth  and  attitude  of  the  deposit 
(underground or open pit), the likely grade of the resource, the existing and potential size of the 
deposit, the likely metallurgical recovery, the location (type of infrastructure available), foreign 
exchange risk, the income tax and royalty structure, third party interests in the property (such as 
net smelter returns or gross override royalties), the level of technical study (scoping study, pre-
feasibility  study,  feasibility  study,  operating  statistics,  etc.),  the  long  term  commodity  price 
outlooks  (for  gold  in  this  case),  the  exploration  potential,  the  expectations  for  replacing 
resources/reserves and adding to them, the political jurisdiction in which the deposit is located, 
etc. In spite of the reasonably wide range of in-situ values, one can determine a much narrower 
range  for  properties  with  similar  attributes.  As  a  result,  this  method  is  often  utilized  as  an 
indicator  of  value,  and  market  capitalizations  per  ounce  are  compiled  by  mining  analysts  and 
mining companies.
Investment dealer and mining analyst CanaccordGenuity periodically compiles the attributed market 
capitalizations  per  ounce  of  gold  in  resources  for  a  variety  of  exploration, development,  and 
producing gold companies. The CanaccordGenuity Junior Mining Weekly provided a list of 40 non-
producing gold companies at the exploration stage through to early-stage development. The average 
(arithmetic mean) of market capitalizations per gold-equivalent ounce in resource was near US$15
per ounce. The foregoing was utilized to value the Barsele Project.
The  NI  43-101  compliant  technical  report  on  the  Barsele  Project,  completed  by  G.H.  Giroux, 
P.Eng., in November 2012, established resources for the Central-Avan-Skirasen zones. At a cut-
off grade of 0.6 g/t gold, the indicated resource amounted to 14.10 million tonnes grading 1.21 g/t 
gold (547,000 contained ounces), while the inferred resource amounted to 20.20 million tonnes 
grading 0.97 g/t gold (627,000 contained ounces). This report also established a small resource 
for the Norra volcanogenic massive sulphide deposit.
Based on a review of the CanaccordGenuity ‘comparables’, and the grade and mineralization of 
the Barsele deposit, Glanville and McKnight are of the opinion that the value per ounce attributed 
to the Barsele possible open resources would be about US$15 per ounce. Applying this number to 
the total of 1,174,000 ounces would result in an indicated value of US$17.6 million, or Cdn$22.9
million for 100% of the property. Glanville and McKnight have increased the foregoing indicated 
value  by  25%  to  Cdn$28.6 million to  account  for  the  Norra  volcanogenic massive  sulphide 
deposit, as well as the exploration potential.
C-23
Summary of Value of Barsele (and Allocations to Orex and SpinCo)
Based on the foregoing two sections of this report, Glanville and McKnight are of the opinion 
that  100%  of  the  value  of  the  Barsele  Project  is  worth  approximately  $30.0 million (placing 
slightly more weight on the attributed value based on the current agreement with Agnico Eagle).
Since Orex’s 2% NSR royalty has been determined to be worth about 10% of the value of 100% 
of Barsele, it would be worth about $3.0 million to Orex. In addition, Orex has received a cash 
payment  from  Agnico Eagle of  US$6.0  million  (Cdn$7.5  million),  and  expects  to  receive 
additional payments of US$4.0 million (discounted to US$3.5 million, or Cdn$4.5 million). As a 
result,  Orex  would  retain  ‘value’  of  Cdn$15.0  million  (Cdn$3.0 million  plus  Cdn$7.5  million 
plus Cdn$4.5 million) out of the total value of Cdn$30 million. This, therefore, leaves a property 
value of Cdn$15.0 million to be transferred to SpinCo. It should be noted, however, that Orex 
will be transferring Cdn$0.5 million in cash to SpinCo, so the total indicated value of SpinCo
would be Cdn$15.5 million.
Further to the foregoing Cdn$15.0 million of Barsele ‘value’ attributed to Orex, one should be 
clear that Orex has already received about Cdn$7.5 million from Agnico Eagle, and this is now 
reflected in working capital. As a result, Orex’s residual value in Barsele is only Cdn$7.5 million,
which is made up of the Cdn$3.0 million value for the 2% NSR, plus the Cdn$4.5 million present 
value of the remaining cash payments by Agnico (since Orex will be retaining both the 2% NSR 
and  the  remaining  cash  payments  from  Agnico).  In  summary,  the  allocation  of  the  Barsele 
Property interests after the Proposed Arrangement with SpinCo would be as follows:
Interest of SpinCo:
Cdn$15.0 million
Interest of Orex:                                 Cdn$  7.5 million
               Subtotal:                                            Cdn$22.5 million
Already Received by Orex:                Cdn$  7.5 million
Total Indicated Value of Barsele:       Cdn$30.0 million
It should be noted that a portion of this Cdn$7.5 million has been utilized for general expenses. 
Thus, it is accounted for in the net working capital of Orex, which is currently estimated to be 
approximately Cdn$6.0 million.
Coneto Property Valuation
The  valuation  of  Coneto  (and  the  net  beneficial  interest  of  Orex)  has  been  based  on a
combination  of  factors,  including  the  Fresnillo  option  terms,  dollars  per  ounce  of  ‘inferred 
resources’  (not  NI  43-101  compliant),  and  dollars  per  hectare  for  prospective  properties  in 
excellent locations (relative to mineralized trends and other properties or deposits).
Regarding  the  option  terms,  on  February  12,  2012,  an Association  Agreement  was  signed  by
Orex  and  Fresnillo, whereby  the  companies  would  jointly  explore  the  contiguous  mineral 
concessions held by Orex and Fresnillo in the Coneto mining district. According to the terms of 
the Agreement, Fresnillo would have the option to spend a minimum of US$2.0 million during 
each of the first three years (for a total of at least US$6.0 million over the three years), with a 
minimum of 70% of the exploration expenditures to be conducted on Orex’s concessions. Upon 
Fresnillo spending an aggregate of US$6.0 million, Orex and Fresnillo will each contribute their 
respective Coneto mining concessions to NewCo that initially would be owned 55% by Fresnillo 
and 45% by Orex. Fresnillo will have the right to increase its interest in NewCo to 70% by either
C-24
completing a prefeasibility study or spending up to an additional US$21.0 million in the process 
of preparing a prefeasibility study. During the life of the Association Agreement, in the event that
Orex, or any of its subsidiaries, enters into a transaction to acquire an interest in any additional 
mineral properties in Mexico and then later decides to sell or option out that interest to a third 
party, Fresnillo will have a  right of first refusal  to participate in such transaction on the same 
terms and conditions as offered to the third party. In conjunction with entering the Association 
Agreement with Fresnillo, Orex issued 2,500,000 units to Fresnillo at $0.80 per unit for gross 
proceeds  of  $2.0  million.  Each  unit  consisted  of  one  common  share  and  one  half  of  one 
transferable share purchase warrant (with an exercise price of $1.00 per share over the subsequent 
two years).
Based upon the terms of the Association Agreement (and adjusting for the timing and estimated 
probability  of  continuing  with  the  Association  Agreement),  the  contribution  of  the  Fresnillo 
property interests in the area, the associated financing by Fresnillo, the expenditures to date by 
Fresnillo, and the potential interest to be earned by Fresnillo, it is the opinion of Glanville and 
McKnight  that  the  indicated  value  of  the  Coneto  Project  would  be  approximately  US$10  to 
US$15  million.  Based  on  applying  comparable  ‘dollars-per-ounce’  numbers  to ‘inferred 
resources’ (internal calculations only), and dollars per hectare of prospective land in known gold 
belts, the value of 100% of Coneto would be similar to that determined by the Fresnillo option 
agreement.  Utilizing  a  value  of  US$12.0 million (within  the  range  of  US$10.0 to  US$15.0
million), Orex’s net interest would be 45% of this, or just over US$5.4 million, or approximately 
Cdn$7.0  million. However,  it  should  be  noted  that  if  Fresnillo  decides  to  sole-fund  future 
expenditures up to the an additional US$21 million in the process of preparing a prefeasibility 
study,  the  implied  value  of  Orex’s  interest  in  Coneto  would  be  substantially  higher  than  the 
estimated $7.0 million.
Los Crestones Valuation
The Los Crestones Property is an attractive exploration target, with good preliminary exploration
results. These results are from chip sampling, mapping, surface geochemistry (soil samples), and 
a  first-pass  diamond  drill  program.  The  best  drill  results  to  date  correspond  to  the  northern 
extension of the Indio vein and central portion of Bohemia. The intersection from the northern 
drilling at Indio returned 3.09 meters averaging 479 g/t silver and 3.5% copper, while the best 
results  from  Bohemia  included  5  meters  averaging  39.1  g/t  gold,  93.3  g/t  silver,  and  2.13% 
copper. In addition to the foregoing, assay results have been received from samples which had 
been sent to the laboratory by the previous operator, Astral Mining, but had not been analysed. 
Hole 11LD014 included a further 0.45 meters grading Au 45.8 g/t, Ag 87 g/t (Au-Eq 47.4 g/t or 
Ag-Eq 2,606 g/t), plus Cu 2.41 %.  Hole 11LD011 returned 1.50 meters grading Au 5.79 g/t.
Based  on  the  exploration results,  the  prior  exploration  and  acquisition  expenditures  by  Orex 
(approximately $2.0 million), the three obvious veins (and associated breccia zones) identified to 
date, the recommended exploration program, the terms of the prior acquisition agreement, and the 
halting of the proposed 5,000 meters of drilling after only 2,500 meters had been drilled, it is the 
opinion  of  Glanville  and  McKnight  that  the  value  of  Orex’s  net  interest  in  the  Los  Crestone 
property would be approximately US$2.5 million (about Cdn$3.1 million).
C-25
Jumping Josephine Valuation
In June of 2011, Apex Geoscience completed an NI 43-101 technical report on a 400 metre long 
portion  of  the  mineralized  zone  at  Jumping  Josephine  Main.  Apex  calculated  an  indicated 
resource  of  363,000  tonnes  grading  2.95  g/t  gold  (34,000  contained  ounces)  and  an  inferred 
resource  of  448,000  tonnes  averaging  2.08  g/t  gold  (30,000  contained  ounces).  Although  the 
resource is small, it is located not far from Teck Resources’ smelter/refinery in Trail, B.C., as 
well as processing plants in the general area. As a result, we have applied US$7.0 per contained 
ounce (the median of a number of similar deposits, as determined by CanaccordGenuity) to arrive 
at an indicated value of 100% of Jumping Josephine of US$0.45 million, or Cdn$0.58 million. It
should also be noted that Orex purchased the minority 40% interest in Jumping Josephine in early 
2014 by issuing 1,000,000 Orex shares valued at Cdn$230,000. Although this transaction implied 
a value of $575,000 for 100% of the project ($230,000 divided by 40%), it should be emphasized 
that  the market  for  mineral  properties  was  substantially  better  in  early  2014  than  today. On 
balance, Glanville and McKnight are of the opinion that the current value of Jumping Josephine 
would be approximately $0.5 million.
Summary of Values of Mineral Properties
The following values represent the net beneficial interests of Orex (in Canadian dollars) in its 
mineral  exploration  properties  (plus  working  capital)  after  taking  into  account  ownership 
percentages,  royalties  payable,  and  option  terms  (remaining  payments,  share  issuances,  and 
exploration commitments):
Barsele Project:                                                                $22.5 million15
Coneto Project:                                                                    7.0 million
Working Capital:                                                                 6.0 million
                        Los Crestones:                                                                     3.1 million 
Jumping Josephine.:                                                            0.5 million
Total Value of Mineral Properties:                                  $39.1 million
Orex is planning to spin out its 45% interest in the Barsele Project to SpinCo. However, the 2% 
NSR royalty and the future cash payments from Agnico Eagle (US$2.0 million at each of the first 
and second anniversary of the closing of the Transaction) will be retained by New Orex (as well 
as the US$6.0 million cash payment already received by Orex). As a result, the value of the assets 
to be spun out to SpinCo is estimated to be approximately $15.5 million ($15.0 million value of 
SpinCo’s  beneficial  interest  in  Barsele,  plus  $0.5  million  cash  from  Orex).  As  a  result  of  the 
foregoing,  the  value  of  the  assets  to  remain  with  New  Orex  would  be  $23.6 million ($39.1 
million minus $15.5 million).
Based on the foregoing, the value of SpinCo would account for almost 40% of the existing value 
of Orex ($15.5 million divided by $39.1 million), and New Orex would account for just over 60% 
of  Orex  ($23.6  million  divided  by  $39.1  million).  However,  due  to  the  fact  that  valuations  of
15 This  excludes  the  US$6.0  million  (about  Cdn$7.5  million)  already  received  by  Orex.  As  a  result,  the  total 
valuation  of  Barsele  would  have  been  approximately  Cdn$30.0  million. The  cash  received  by  Orex  from  Agnico 
Eagle is accounted for as working capital.
C-26
early-stage exploration projects are not precise, Glanville and McKnight are of the opinion that 
the value of SpinCo would account for somewhere between 35% and 45% of the total value of all 
of Orex.
Fairness Considerations
In  connection  with  the  provision  of  the  Fairness  Opinion,  Glanville  and  McKnight  have 
performed  a  variety  of  financial,  technical,  and  other  analyses.  In  arriving  at  the  Fairness 
Opinion,  they  have  not  attributed  any  particular  weight  to  any  specific  analysis  or  factor 
considered by them, but rather Glanville and McKnight have made qualitative judgments based 
on their experience in  rendering such opinions  and on the circumstances and information as a 
whole.  Glanville  and  McKnight  considered  a  number  of  factors  in  arriving  at  the  Fairness 
Opinion, including the foregoing calculations, and the following, among others.
(cid:120)

of  the  date  hereof,  and  under  the  stated  conditions  and  limitations,  Glanville  and  McKnight 
cannot  guarantee  their  accuracy.  In  addition,  Glanville  and  McKnight  disclose  that  they  have 
conducted neither a title search, nor an ownership review, nor have they visited the properties or

market conditions, and on information provided by Orex and others. The use of this Fairness 
Opinion and/or any information contained in it shall be at the user’s sole risk, regardless of any 
fault or negligence of Glanville or McKnight.
Fairness Opinion
Based upon and subject to the limitations in this Fairness Opinion, and such other matters 
as McKnight and Glanville have considered relevant, it is their opinion that, as of the date 
hereof, the terms of the proposed Arrangement are fair from a financial point of view to the 
Orex  shareholders.  However,  Glanville  and  McKnight  express  no  opinion  as  to  the  expected 
trading prices of the shares of SpinCo and New Orex if the Proposed Arrangement is completed, 
or of Orex if it is terminated.
Glanville  and  McKnight  also  estimated  the  values  of  the  net  beneficial  interests  of  Orex  (in 
Canadian  dollars)  in  its  mineral  exploration  properties  (and  working  capital)  after  taking  into
C-27
account ownership percentages, royalties payable, and option terms (remaining payments, share 
issuances,  and  exploration  commitments).  The  major  components  of  value  are  summarized 
below:
Barsele Project:                                                                $22.5 million16

Working Capital:                                                                 6.0 million
                        Los Crestones:                                                                     3.1 million
                        Jumping Josephine.:                                                            0.5 million
$39.1 million
Total Value of Mineral Properties:
Orex is planning to spin out its 45% interest in the Barsele project to SpinCo. However, the 2% 
NSR royalty and the future cash payments from Agnico Eagle (US$2.0 million at each of the first 
and second anniversary of the closing of the transaction) will be retained by New Orex (as well as 
the US$6.0 million cash payment already received by Orex). As a result, the value of the assets to 
be spun out to SpinCo is estimated to be approximately $15.5 million ($15.0 million value of 
SpinCo’s beneficial 45% interest in Barsele, plus $0.5 million cash from Orex). As a result of the 
foregoing,  the  value  of  the  assets  to  remain  with  New  Orex  would  be  $23.6 million ($39.1 
million minus $15.5 million).
Based on the foregoing, the value of SpinCo would account for almost 40% of the existing value 
of Orex ($15.5 million divided by $39.1 million), and New Orex would account for just over 60% 
of  Orex  ($23.6  million  divided  by  $39.1  million).  However,  due  to  the  fact  that  valuations  of 
early-stage exploration projects are not precise, Glanville and McKnight are of the opinion that 
the value of SpinCo would account for somewhere between 35% and 45% of the total value of all 
of Orex.
This Fairness Opinion may be relied upon (subject to the qualifications set out in this report) by 
the Board, regulatory authorities including the TSX-V, and shareholders of Orex, but may not be 
used or relied upon by any other person without express prior written consent of McKnight and 
Glanville.  However,  McKnight  and  Glanville  consent  to  the  duplication  and  inclusion  of  this 
Fairness Opinion in the Information Circular.

DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS
Orex's primary business objective will continue to be to conduct exploration on the Los Crestones Project 
and Jumping Josephine Project and to maintain its remaining properties. In particular, Orex's objective 
will be to carry out the exploration programs recommended in the Los Crestones Technical Report and 
the Jumping Josephine Technical Report.
After  the  Arrangement  Orex  also  plans  to  continue  to  seek  out  new  mineral  project  opportunities  in 
Mexico and may seek to acquire interests in additional properties if Orex believes such properties have 
sufficient geologic or economic potential and if Orex has adequate financial resources to complete such 
acquisitions.    Orex  may  explore  joint  venture  options  or  otherwise  dispose  of  projects  in  the  normal 
course of Orex's operations. See "Mineral Projects" below for further information on Orex's properties.
Upon  completion  of  the  Arrangement,  New  Orex  Shareholders  will  hold  in  the  aggregate  100%  of  the 
issued  and  outstanding  New  Common  Shares,  and  Orex  will  have  the  same  directors,  staff  and 
management team as Orex's current directors, staff and management team, plus approximately $5,500,000 
in cash to pursue the exploration and maintenance of the Los Crestones Project, the Jumping Josephine 
Project and its remaining properties.

On June 11, 2015, the Gunnarn JV was completed and Agnico Eagle, through AE Sweden, acquired a 55% 
interest  in  Gunnarn  in  consideration  of  an  initial  payment  to  Orex  of  US$6,000,000.  An  additional 
US$2,000,000 will be payable by AE Sweden, or by Agnico Eagle on AE Sweden's behalf, to Orex in cash 
or common shares of Agnico Eagle at AE Sweden's election on each of the first and second anniversaries 
of the closing of  the  Gunnarn JV. The right to receive such future payments under the  share purchase 
agreement will be retained by Orex after completion of the Arrangement.
As  part  of  the  Gunnarn  JV  and  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  Gunnarn  JV  Agreement,  which  is 
available for public viewing on Orex's SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com, AE Sweden has committed to 
spend US$7,000,000 on Barsele Project expenditures over three years. Under the Gunnarn JV Agreement, 
AE Sweden may make a cash payment to Orex to satisfy any required Barsele Project expenditures that it 
does not otherwise make. Spinco will be assigned the right to receive any such payments as part of the 
Spinco Reorganization. Pursuant to the Gunnarn JV Agreement, if AE Sweden or Agnico Eagle prepares a 
pre-feasibility  study  on  the  Barsele  Project  and  contributes  it  to  Gunnarn,  AE  Sweden's  interest  in 
Gunnarn  will  increase  to  70%  and  Orex's  interest  in  Gunnarn  will  be  reduced  to  30%.  Until  such  pre-
feasibility  study  is  contributed  to  Gunnarn  by  AE  Sweden  or  Agnico  Eagle,  all  costs  and  expenses  of 
Gunnarn  will  be  for  the  account  of  AE  Sweden  and,  following  the  completion  of  such  pre-feasibility 
study, all costs and expenses of Gunnarn will be shared by AE Sweden and Orex in accordance with their 
proportionate interests  in  Gunnarn. In accordance  with the  Gunnarn JV Agreement, AE Sweden is the 
operator  of  the  Barsele  Project  for  customary  compensation  and  has  a  majority  of  seats  on  Gunnarn's 
board of directors (the "Gunnarn Board").
In connection with the Gunnarn JV, Orex was also assigned a 2% NSR on production from the Barsele 
Project,  which  NSR  interest  may  be  repurchased  by  Agnico  at  any  time  for  US$5,000,000.  The  NSR 
interest will be retained by Orex after completion of the Arrangement.
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Orex will assign the Gunnarn JV Agreement to Spinco as part of 
the Spinco Reorganization.  Orex expects that, on the Effective Date, it will be released from substantially 
all of its obligations under the Gunnarn JV Agreement on the assignment of the Gunnarn JV Agreement 
to Spinco, other than liabilities arising in respect of conduct that occurred prior to the assignment and its 
obligations  to  provide  its  proportionate  share  of  funds  to  Gunnarn  to  satisfy  environmental  and  other 
obligations of Gunnarn that arose out of activities conducted prior to such assignment.
Three-Year History
For a description of how Orex's business has developed over the last three completed financial years and 
the  period  from  May  1,  2014  to  the  date  of  the  Meeting,  refer  to  Orex's  MD&A  related  to  the  audited 
consolidated financial statements for the financial years ended April 30, 2015, April 30, 2014 and April 30, 
2013, which have been filed on Orex's SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com.
Orex is currently in negotiations with a third party to obtain an option for a potential controlling interest 
of mineral properties owned by the third party.
Coneto Property, Mexico
On July 16, 2009, Orex signed a letter of intent to purchase 100% of the core mineral concessions within 
the  Coneto  Property  in  Durango  State,  Mexico,  in  exchange  for  2,200,000  Orex  Shares.  The  definitive 
purchase  agreement,  signed  on  September  1,  2009,  was  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  TSX-V.  After 
receiving  TSX-V  approval,  on  April  15,  2010,  Orex  issued  2,200,000  Orex  Shares  to  the  vendors  of  the 
Coneto concessions, valued at $2,090,000. The Coneto Property is subject to a 2.5% NSR payable to the 
vendors.

Located in the Mesa Central on the eastern flank  of the Sierra Madre Occidental Mountains, Coneto is 
centrally positioned in the "Mexican Silver Trend". This silver trend, stretching from Guanajuato in the 
southeast, through the states of Zacatecas and Durango, hosts some of the world's largest silver deposits, 
including Real de Angeles, Zacatecas, Fresnillo, La Preciosa and La Pitarilla mining camps.
The Coneto mining camp has a history going back over 400 years. More than 40 epithermal silver-gold 
quartz  veins  have  been  documented  in  a  window  of  exposed  Tertiary  Lower  Volcanic  andesites.  Past 
underground production was achieved on three of the veins down to the watertable. Prior to Orex, very 
little diamond drilling  had been carried out within the property  in spite of its  long history of episodic 
production.
The Coneto mining camp historically consisted of approximately 3,300 hectares of claims. During 2010, 
Orex announced its successful applications to locate new mineral concessions called Lomas 3 and Lomas 
4, which surround the historical claims. With the addition of these new mineral concessions, the total area 
of the Coneto Property increased to 16,346 hectares.
The initial work program on the Coneto Property consisted of detailed structural geology mapping and 
geochemical sampling in the areas around Calaveras, Colemanito, Promontorio, Loma Verde, Durazno 
and Impulsora. This program was designed to guide a diamond drilling program. As of December 2009, 
regional geology mapping at 1:10,000 scale covered 35 km2 and detailed structural geology mapping at 
1:500  scale  covered  15  km2.  Forty-nine  line-kilometres  of  geochemical  sampling,  both  for  soil  and  rock 
channel/chip/grab,  total  1,794  samples.  The  Loma  Verde,  Promontorio  and  Impulsora  sectors  yielded 
multiple anomalous values for gold and silver.
The Phase-I drilling campaign of approximately 5,000 metres of HQ and NQ diameter core commenced 
in May 2010 and was performed by Major Drilling de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. utilizing a surface UDR-200 
rig. A total of 21 holes were completed in the Loma Verde, Durazno, Promontorio, Impulsora, Estrella-
Calaveras  and  Sauce-Palma  areas.  Over  2,000  drill  core  samples  were  submitted  for  analyses  to  SGS 
Mineral  Services  in  Durango,  Mexico.  The  assay  results  of  the  drilling  campaign  were  announced  by 
news releases of  Orex  on July 6, 2010, August 9, 2010 and November 1, 2010. Nine  holes yielded high 
values for gold and silver, especially in the Loma Verde and Impulsora areas.
During  fiscal  2011,  Orex  signed  a  non-binding  letter  of  intent  with  Fresnillo  Plc  ("Fresnillo")  to  jointly 
explore the contiguous mineral concessions held by Orex and Fresnillo in the Coneto mining district. A 
definitive  association  agreement  was  signed  on  February  2,  2012  (the  "Association  Agreement").  The 
principal terms of the Association Agreement are as follows:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
Fresnillo  will  spend  a  minimum  of  US$2,000,000  on  exploration  during  the  first  year  after  the 
necessary  exploration  permits  are  obtained.  A  minimum  of  70%  of  this  exploration  must  be 
conducted on Orex's concessions.
Fresnillo  will  have  the  option  to  spend  an  additional  US$2,000,000  per  year  on  exploration  for 
each of the following two years. A minimum of 70% of this exploration must also be conducted 
on Orex's concessions.
Upon  Fresnillo  spending  an  aggregate  of  US$6,000,000  on  exploration  activities,  Orex  and 
Fresnillo  will  each  contribute  their  respective  Coneto  mining  concessions  to  a  new  company 
("NewCo") that initially would be owned 55% by Fresnillo and 45% by Orex.
Fresnillo will have the right to increase its ownership of NewCo to 70% by either completing a 
prefeasibility study or spending up to an additional US$21,000,000 in the process of preparing a 
prefeasibility study.
E-4
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
If Fresnillo chooses not to exercise the right to increase its ownership of NewCo to 70%, the costs 
incurred to complete a prefeasibility study will be shared by Fresnillo and Orex in proportion to 
their ownership of NewCo – 55% by Fresnillo and 45% by Orex.
Any  additional  funding  required  by  NewCo  will  be  provided  by  Orex  and  Fresnillo  in 
proportion to their respective ownership interests in NewCo at that time.
Fresnillo will have a right of first refusal to acquire Orex's ownership interest in NewCo if Orex 
receives an offer for its interest in NewCo that it proposes to accept.
During the life of the Association Agreement, in the event that Orex, or any of its subsidiaries, 
enters into a transaction to acquire an interest in any additional mineral properties in Mexico and 
then later decides to sell or option out that interest to a third party, Fresnillo will have a right of 
first refusal to participate in such transaction on the same terms and conditions as offered to the 
third party.
In conjunction with entering the Association Agreement with Fresnillo, on February 8, 2012, Orex issued 
2,500,000 units to Fresnillo at $0.80 per unit for gross proceeds of $2,000,000 under a non-brokered private 
placement.  Each  unit  consisted  of  one  Orex  Share  and  one  half  of  one  transferable  share  purchase 
warrant. The share purchase warrants were not exercised and expired on February 8, 2014.
A Phase-II diamond drilling program of 31 holes, totally 11,998 metres, commenced in late August 2012 
and  a  second  drill  was  added  in  October  2012.  The  contracted  drilling  company,  Kluane  Drilling  Ltd. 
("Kluane"), utilized modularized mobile drilling equipment that minimizes the need to construct roads 
on  the  property.  The  total  cost  for  the  Phase  II  drilling  program,  including  pre-drilling  geological  and 
geophysical mapping, was approximately $3,300,000, an amount which was entirely funded by Fresnillo 
per the terms of the Association Agreement.
The results from the 31 diamond drill holes in the Loma Verde, Central Zone, Impulsora, Promontorio 
and La Bufa areas of the Phase-II program, yielded high grade intercepts of gold and silver in the Loma 
Verde and La Bufa areas, with results announced in news releases of Orex dated November 7, 2012 and 
January 7 and March 25, 2013.
Also  in  fiscal  2013,  a  detailed  surface  trench  channel  sampling  program  was  initiated  on  various 
mineralized  structures  at  Coneto.  Results  for  the  Loma  Verde,  Santo  Nino  and  Impulsora  were 
announced in news releases of Orex dated July 10, August 20, and October 7, 2013.
On July 2, 2014 a Phase – III diamond drilling program commenced for 30 holes, totalling 11,744 metres. 
Kluane Drilling Ltd. was awarded the drilling contract and three drilling rigs were utilized.
The results from the Phase – III 30 diamond drill holes in the Promontorio, Impulsora, Loma Verde, La 
Bufa and Central areas yielded high-grade intercepts in the Loma Verde and Promontorio areas. Results 
were announced in news releases of Orex dated October 7, November 18 and December 8, 2014.
In  August  2014,  Fresnillo  confirmed  that  it  had  met  its  exploration  expenditure  obligation  for  the  first 
investment option stage of US$4,000,000 and it was proceeding directly to the second investment option 
stage on the Coneto Property.
In  March  2015,  plans  for  a  Phase-IV  diamond  drilling  program  were  prepared,  totaling  approximately 
4,500 metres in 11 holes. This program commenced in 2nd quarter 2015 and will be completed in the 3rd 
quarter 2015.
E-5
Total  diamond  drilling  to  date  on  the  Coneto  Property  equals  33,343  metres  in  93  holes.  Plans  for 
conducting an initial resource estimate on the Coneto Property are scheduled for the 3rd quarter of 2015.
In August 2015, Fresnillo confirmed that effective July 31, 2015, it had spent an aggregate of US$6,000,000 
on  exploration  activities  on  the  Coneto  Property.  As  such,  Orex  and  Fresnillo  will  continue  their  joint 
venture relationship and will contribute their respective Coneto mining concessions to Newco which will 
continue to be 55% owned by Fresnillo and 45% owned by Orex.
Las Mesas Property, Mexico
On  November  30,  2010,  Orex  entered  into  an  option  agreement  to  acquire  a  100%  interest  in  the  Las 
Mesas  property  in  Durango,  Mexico  from  La  Cuesta  International,  S.A.  de  C.V.  ("La  Cuesta")  for 
US$4,000,000, less any option maintenance payments paid before the exercise of the option. To initiate the 
option agreement, Orex paid La Cuesta $35,200 (US$35,000) in cash. The Las Mesas property is subject to 
a 1% NSR payable to La Cuesta. To maintain the option in good standing, Orex was required to make 
staged  cash  payments  to  La  Cuesta  totalling  US$77,500  over  four  years  and  then  US$40,000  each 
subsequent year. In addition, Orex was required to incur exploration expenditures of US$50,000 on the 
Las Mesas property before December 1, 2011. Subsequent to April 30, 2011, Orex received the assays from 
its drill program on Las Mesas and management was disappointed with the overall results. A decision 
was  made  to  terminate  the  Las  Mesas  option  agreement  and  consequently,  mineral  property  costs  of 
$35,200 were written-off during fiscal year 2011.
Astral Mining Corporation
On February 12, 2013, Orex acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Astral pursuant 
to  a  plan  of  arrangement  (the  "Astral Arrangement").    Astral  is  now,  and  following  completion  of  the 
Arrangement,  will  continue  to  be,  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  Orex.    Pursuant  to  the  Astral 
Arrangement,  Orex  issued  to  former  Astral  shareholders  0.0834  of  an  Orex  Share  for  each  issued  and 
outstanding  common  share  of  Astral.  A  total  of  2,083,795  Orex  Shares  were  issued  to  the  former 
shareholders  of  Astral.    Furthermore,  certain  unsecured  creditors  and  holders  of  convertible  notes  of 
Astral have converted debt owed to them by Astral into Orex Shares in settlement of the debt. The debt 
was converted into a total of 840,425 Orex Shares based on a deemed price of $0.571699 per share, which 
is equal to the volume weighted average closing price of Orex Shares as traded on the TSX-V for the five 
trading days before the closing of the Astral Arrangement on the terms and conditions contained in debt 
settlement agreements.  Upon issuance of the Orex Shares to the Astral noteholders, their notes have been 
cancelled  and  the  general  security  agreements  granted  by  Astral  to  secure  their  notes  have  been 
discharged. One of the note holders is a company wholly-owned by Manfred Kurschner, former CEO and 
a director of Astral. Nick DeMare, a former director of Astral, is the sole owner of one company and 50% 
owner of another company that held convertible notes.
In connection with the Astral Arrangement, Orex acquired the Jumping Josephine Project located in the 
West Kootenay region of Southeastern British Columbia, Canada and the Los Crestones Project located in 
the  Sierra  Madre  Occidental  of  Sinaloa  State,  western  Mexico.    See  "Mineral  Projects"  below  for  more 
information.
Recent Financings
On  January  19,  2015,  Orex  completed  a  non-brokered  private  placement  consisting  of  4,800,000  Orex 
Shares at a price of $0.25 per share for gross proceeds of $1,200,000. Orex paid a finder's fee of 48,000 Orex 
Shares to an arm's length individual in connection with the private placement.

Mineral Projects
For  the  purposes  of  the  Circular,  the  material  mineral  properties  of  Orex  following  completion  of  the 
Arrangement will be the Los Crestones Project and the Coneto Property, Mexico.
Los Crestones Project, Mexico
The information below has been extracted in whole or in part from  the summary contained in the Los 
Crestones Technical Report. Orex Shareholders are encouraged to read the entire Los Crestones Technical 
Report,  which  is  available  for  public  viewing  on  Orex's  SEDAR  profile  at  www.sedar.com  and  is 
incorporated by reference into the Circular.
Property Location and Access
Los  Crestones  is  an  early  stage  gold-silver-copper  property  located  in  the  gold-silver  belt  of  the  Sierra 
Madre  Occidental  of  Sinaloa  State,  Western  Mexico.    The  property  totals  4,168  hectares  in  three 
contiguous claims and was initially optioned by Astral from local parties in January 2011.  The property 
is located approximately 110 km from the state capital of Culiacán and is accessed by way of federal and 
state  highways  to  the  town  of  Surutato  and  then  by  narrow  dirt  road  to  the  village  of  Plan  Grande.  
Currently,  access  to  key  mineralized  showings  on  the  property  is  facilitated  by  a  network  of  ATV 
motorcycle trails from Plan Grande.
E-7
Property History
The claims were staked in 2009 and in several locations host evidence of small scale historical exploratory 
work  in  the  form  of  small  adits  and  exploratory  shafts.   This  work  has  focussed  on  mineralized 
structures, often silicified, forming erosion resistant ribs locally known as "crestons".  The limited extent 
of historical workings indicates the property has seen no significant production.  A total of 208 grab and 
chip  samples  were  collected  by  previous  operators  and  the  site  displays  no  evidence  of  mechanized 
exploration  work  before  Astral's  involvement  in  late  2010.   During  2011,  Astral  conducted  first  pass 
geochemical and geological reconnaissance work culminating in an eighteen hole, 2,618 metres diamond 
drill program which ran from late August to late October 2011 to test the Bohemia, El Indio and Corona 
structures. Multiple mineralized intercepts were achieved from silicified and brecciated intrusive dykes.  
Drilling  recovered  primarily  HQ  sized  core,  drill  diameter  was  reduced  to  NQ2  size  where  necessary 
depending on ground conditions and drill capacity at depth.  The highest gold content was reported in 
drill hole 11LD-011, which yielded 5.00 metres (true thickness of 3.54 metres) grading 39.1 g/t gold, 93 
g/t silver and 2.13% copper from the Bohemia structure. The highest silver content was reported in drill 
hole 11LD-006, which yielded 3.09 metres (true thickness of 2.18 metres) grading 0.14 g/t gold, 479 g/t 
silver and 3.5% copper from the El Indio structure.
During  2014,  Orex  recommenced  exploration  at  Los  Crestones.   During  the  first  half  of  the  year,  Orex 
completed  first  pass  geological  mapping  and  prospecting  over  roughly  30%  of  the  property  including 
collection  of  560  grab  and  channel  samples.   A  property-wide  helicopter  airborne  magnetic  and 
radiometric geophysical survey was flown by MPX Geoservices Ltd. in April to May 2014. A follow-up 
ground  geophysical  survey,  consisting  of  18-line  kilometers  of  Induced  Polarization  (IP)  and 
Magnetotellurics was conducted by Quantec Geoscience Ltd. in July to August 2014.  Phase-II diamond 
drilling program, planned for 5,000 metres, utilizing a man-portable KD-1000 diamond drilling rig, was 
awarded to Kluane. This phase commenced on  December 7, 2014, shut down for the year-end holiday 
season  and  recommenced  on  January  15,  2015.  Five  holes  of  Phase-II  were  drilled  for  2,587  m.  Initial 
results differed from those anticipated and the Los Crestones Project was placed under review. There are 
additional exploration targets on the property.
Total drilling to date on Los Crestones Project equals 5,387 meters in 23 drill holes.
Geology and Mineralization
The  property  is  located  within  the  Sierra  Madre  Occidental  and  is  underlain  by  Early-Mid  Miocene 
andesitic volcanic rocks subsequently intruded by Tertiary multi-phase felsic stock(s) comprising mostly 
massive  granodiorite  and  monzonite.  Upper  Tertiary  rhyolitic  dykes  cut  all  phases  of  intrusive  and 
volcanic  rocks.  Originally  thought  to  host  low-medium  sulphidation  epithermal  mineralization,  Orex's 
recent  work  recognizes  characteristics  of  a  diatreme-breccia  complex  or  even  the  upper  levels  of  a 
mineralized porphyry system on the property.  Ongoing work aims to confirm these observations.
Anomalous base metal +/- gold and silver mineralization has been observed on the property related to 
NNW  trending  rhyolitic  dykes  and  also  as  a  matrix  component  in  north-south  oriented  breccias  and 
veins.  Strongest mineralization to date has been returned from vein/breccia hosted gold-silver-copper 
focussed  in  north  trending  brittle  structural  zones  within  volcanics  on  the  eastern  flank  of  a 
granodiorite/monzonite intrusive body.  Mineralization in these zones (sulphide mineralization in order 
of abundance: pyrite, chalcopyrite and silver sulphosalts) is often spatially associated with silica flooding 
and quartz/calcite stockwork veining within brittle structural zones demonstrating a general north-south 
orientation.  Mapping  has  identified  individual  zones  up  to  approximately  900  m  in  length  on  surface 
(Indio structure).
E-8
The  region  is  host  to  a  new  producing  mine  (See  Section  15.0  of  the  Los  Crestones  Technical  Report: 
Adjacent Properties), McEwan Mining's El Gallo Deposit (Reserves: 38,176,000 ounces silver and 46,102 
ounces gold in the proven and probable categories) located approximately 40 km southwest of the Los 
Crestones property. The El Gallo District can be classified (Addison, R., Gates, P.A. and McMahon A.M., 
2011)  as  hosting  low  to  intermediate  sulphidation  epithermal  precious  metal  deposits.  Silver  and  gold 
mineralization occurs in structural zones consisting of silicified quartz breccias and quartz stockwork that 
are generally hosted in volcanic rocks and near or along contacts with volcanic and intrusive rocks.
Ownership
The three claims comprising the Los Crestones property are currently registered to five individuals from 
two  families  (Coronel  27.5%  owner,  Esparza  72.5%  owner).  Astral's  100%  owned  subsidiary,  Astral 
Mining S.A. de C.V., signed a letter of intent with the owners in January 2011 whereby Astral could earn 
100%  ownership  of  the  claims  by  making  staged  payments  totalling  US$750,000  over  a  period  of  four 
years. The final payment was made by Astral S.A. de C.V. in January 2015, completing the requirements 
of the agreement. The Company has now earned a 100% interest in the Los Crestones Property and upon 
exercise  of  the  option,  the  vendors  will  retain  a  0.5%  NSR  (0.25%  payable  to  each  family)  on  the  Los 
Crestones Property, which Astral may purchase for US$400,000.
Recommendations
The  property  is  prospective  for  both  vein/breccia  hosted  gold-silver  +/-  copper  and  bulk  tonnage 
mineralization  related  to  a  porphyry  system  which  may  include  late  stage  mineralized  dykes  and/or 
diatreme-breccia  styles  of  mineralization.   Geophysics  and  surface  work  indicate  that  much  of  the 
mineralization  is  related  to  an  intrusive  stock  located  in  the  southern  half  of  the  property  and  there 
remain  several  untested  showings  related  to  this  intrusion.   Early  drill  results  from  the  2014-2015 
program  were  not  as  strong  as  expected  and  the program  was  suspended  and  the  property  placed  on 
review.   Recommended  activities  include  a  comprehensive  targeting  programme  which  would  include 
results  from  a  continued  geological  mapping  and  sampling  program  in  addition  to  a  reconnaissance 
stream sediment sampling across the northern half of the property.
NI 43-101 Disclosure
All  scientific  and  technical  information  in  the  Circular  relating  to  the  Los  Crestones  Project  has  been 
reviewed and approved by Ben Whiting, P.Geo., consultant to Orex, who is a Qualified Person within the 
meaning of NI 43-101.
Jumping Josephine Project
The  following  summary  information  regarding  the  Jumping  Josephine  Project  is  derived  from  Astral's 
MD&A for the six months ended September 30, 2012 filed on Astral's SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com 
on March 15, 2013, which is incorporated by reference into the Circular.
Property Location and Access
Jumping Josephine is located in the West Kootenay Region in southern British Columbia.  The property 
straddles Highway 3 in the Blueberry Paulson summit area roughly 30 km north of the town of Rossland 
and 30 km west of Castlegar.  Access to the property from Highway 3 is by way of well-formed logging 
roads.
Composed of 24 current mineral claims totalling 11,667 Ha, the property includes the historic Granville 
Mountain Mining Camp.  The Granville Mountain Camp, located in the southern portion of the claims, is
E-9
composed  of a series crown-granted  mineral claims,  seven  of which Astral controls for a total of 91.93 
hectares  ("Ha").    Other  claims  in  the  historic  camp  which  are  not  controlled  by  Astral  cover 
approximately 563 Ha.
Property History
The 24 mineral claims comprising Jumping Josephine were staked during 2003 and 2004 by prospectors 
operating  under  a  grub-stake  arrangement  with  Kootenay  Exploration  Inc.  (now  Kootenay  Silver  Inc. 
("Kootenay")).  In 2006, Astral entered into an option agreement with Kootenay and over the course of the 
next two years fulfilled the terms of the agreement, earning a 60% share in the property and triggering 
the establishment of a 60/40 joint venture with Kootenay, Astral being the majority holder and operator.
Astral added five blocks of claims to the property through option agreements with other parties between 
February 2007 and March 2010.  By 2013, the additional claims had been evaluated, deemed unnecessary 
to  the  exploration  effort  and  surrendered,  thereby  returning  the  property  to  its  original  11,667  Ha,  24 
claim configuration. The additional option agreements did not affect the joint venture with Kootenay in 
any way.
In  February  2014,  Orex  secured  100%  ownership  of  the  Jumping  Josephine  project  when  it  acquired 
Kootenay's 40% share in the property in exchange for issuing 1,000,000 Orex Shares, valued at $230,000.
Exploration History
The JJ Main Gold Zone is the most advanced showing on the property and much of the exploration to 
date  has  focussed  on  this  zone.    JJ  Main  comprises  structurally-controlled  quartz  stockwork  veining 
intersected  by  drilling  over  a  strike  length  of  2.25  km  and  to  vertical  depths  of  up  to  290  m.  Current 
information  indicates  JJ  Main  has  an  estimated  maximum  true  width  of  12.6  m  as  evidenced  by  hole 
07JD013.  Infill  aeromagnetics,  geological  mapping  and  surface  geochemistry  had  suggested  the  host 
structure  for  JJ  Main's  mineralized  stockwork  could  extend  for  over  three  km.  Recent  drilling 
intersections  support  this  idea,  quartz  stockwork  veining  carrying  anomalous  gold  values  has  been 
intersected along the trend over a length of 2.25 km. In addition, drilling has also encountered gold and 
silver mineralization hidden under an area of no outcrop possibly representing a structure parallel to JJ 
Main.  JJ  Main  is  the  subject  of  a  NI  43-101  compliant  resource  calculation  which  has  identified  and 
modelled  potentially  economic  mineralization  over  a  300  m  strike  length  within  the  core  of  the 
mineralized system.
Astral completed two phases of drilling in 2007. The Phase I drill program started in the spring of 2007 
and targeted JJ Main (20 holes for 1,431 m), Bonanza Pass (2 holes for 643 m) and Albion-Dubrovnik areas 
(9 holes for 553 m). The Phase II drill program comprised 5,101 m in 38 holes on the JJ Main Gold Zone. In 
2008, Astral carried out a 34-hole 5,071 m drill program and conducted a 40 line km 3D-IP survey as well 
as carrying out geological mapping and trenching.
Infill  drilling  at  JJ  Main  in  2008  comprised  30  HQ  diamond  drill  holes  (08JD070-100,  08JD091  was 
abandoned) for a total of 3,632.49 m; all holes intersected quartz stockwork veining within and below the 
known  JJ  Main  stockwork  zone.  The  2008  drilling  provides  better  definition  to  the  mineralized  zone 
delineated  in  2007  with  significant  assays  including  4  m  grading  21.04  g/t  gold  from  Hole  08JD092. 
Drilled  intercept  density  within  the  higher-grade  mineralized  shoot  underneath  the  surface  discovery 
zone is now approximately 20m x 20 m.
Other drilling completed in 2008 included testing of two selected IP chargeability anomalies (2 holes for 
893.59m)  and  further  work  along  trend  (2  holes  for  545.73m).  Independent  NI  43-101  reports  detailing
E-10
work  on  the  Jumping  Josephine  Project  Claims  up  to  the  end  of  2009  have  been  completed  by  Apex 
Geoscience and are posted on Orex's SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com.
A  multi-stage  exploration  program  was  recommended  in  the  July  2009  NI  43-101  report  by  Apex 
Geoscience referred to above and much of the work was carried out during the 2009 field season. Details 
of  the  work  are  included  in  the  technical  report,  which  is  posted  Orex's  SEDAR  profile at 
www.sedar.com. Phase 1A included prospecting,  stream sediment sampling and a large regional 5,000 
point  soil  program  over  much  of  the  northern  part  of  the  JJ  Property.  The  program  was  designed  to 
identify gold and arsenic soil anomalies related to JJ Main type gold-bearing structures with associated 
arsenopyrite mineralization. Phase 1B included 136 m of trenching at the Highway showing, located 1.5 
km southwest of the drilling carried out to date along the JJ Main structure.
Astral's 2010 exploration program included a total of 644 m of trenching at the Hillside (211 m), Highway 
(222 m), Big Sheep (165 m) and Siren (46 m) showings. Weakly anomalous results were returned from 
most  trenches.  Astral  completed  an  additional  31  diamond  drill  holes  for  a  total  of  5054  m  during 
summer 2010. The program aimed to test for extensions and/or parallel mineralized zones at the JJ Main 
prospect. Three holes for 531 m were drilled at the Big Sheep prospect area roughly 4.3 km southwest of 
the  JJ  Main  showing  for  no  significant  results.  In  addition,  a  late  fall  drilling  program  comprising  five 
holes for 520 m was completed in the newly identified Cedar zone prospect, a potential parallel zone of 
mineralization  roughly  250  m  northwest  of  the  JJ  Main  showing.  Completed  in  December  2010,  these 
holes were logged and analyzed in early 2011.
Summer drilling in 2010 identified extensions of the JJ Main structure, which may be projected from JJ 
Main  to  the  Highway  showing,  a  total  length  of  2.25  km.  Results  from  the  step  out  drilling  were 
anomalous although high grade shoots such as the core of the JJ Main zone were not encountered. Best 
values from the 2010 drilling at JJ Main include 13.21 m averaging 0.57 g/t gold. Summer drilling also 
targeted a potential parallel zone 250 m northwest of the JJ Main and returned best drill results of 0.5 m 
averaging 2.90 g/t Au and 1.73 m averaging 1.60 g/t from an area of no outcrop known as the "Cedar 
Zone". Drilling during late fall of that year at Cedar returned elevated silver concentrations compared to 
comparable intercepts from the JJ Main Zone. Best results from the late drilling included 1 m averaging 
3.17 g/t Au and 138 g/t silver and 1.2 m averaging 3.39 g/t gold and 284 g/t silver.
In  June  2011,  Astral  reported  a  gold  resource  for  the  core  JJ  Main  discovery  area.  Apex  Geoscience 
completed a NI 43-101 compliant resource calculation on a 400 m long portion of the mineralized zone at 
JJ  Main.  Apex  Geoscience  calculated  the  current  resource  at  363,000  tonnes  averaging  2.95  g/t  Au  for 
34,000 ounces indicated category and 448,000 tonnes averaging 2.08 g/t Au for 30,000 ounces Au inferred 
category. The report dated June 24, 2011 is the most recent technical report on JJ Main and is posted on 
Orex's SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com.
The  2014  exploration  programme  included  geological  mapping,  prospecting,  trenching  and  diamond 
drilling of key areas on the claims.  The programme commenced in late May 2014 and was designed to 
culminate in a two phase drill program. Phase I targeted down-dip extensions beneath the resource area 
of  JJ  Main  Gold  Zone  (4287  metres).   A  range  of  satellite  showings  were  tested  in  Phase  II;  Bonanza 
(Golden Crown and BZT showings – 2085 metres), Hillside (720 metres), Borrow Pit (198 metres) and JJ 
West  (825  metres).   Phase  I  encountered  significant  faulting  and  dyke  emplacement  through  the  target 
zone  at  depth  and  strong  mineralization  was  not  encountered,  best  results  of  13  m  averaging  0.60  g/t 
gold were returned.  Mineralization intersected in Phase II included 1 m grading 12.90 g/t gold from the 
BZT showing.  At the close of the program total of 8,115 metres in 25 HQ and NQ holes were drilled.  In 
addition,  trench  re-sampling  by  Orex  at  JJ  Main  sought  to  confirm  Astral's  previously  quoted  surface 
values,  with  results  were  announced  by  Orex  in  news  releases  dated  November  14  and  December  19, 
2014.    New  trenching  work  was  performed  at  Hillside  showing  four  trenches  totalling  978  m  were
E-11
excavated with 62 m of prospective rock sampled for no significant results.  Total drilling to date on the 
Jumping Josephine Project equals 26,499 metres in 164 drill holes.
All drill core samples from Astral's programs were from NQ or HQ diameter core halved by diamond 
saw.  Given  the  occurrence  of  visible  gold  often  observed  in  the  mineralized  zone,  a  large  1,000  gram 
portion of each pulverized sample was analyzed for gold by the screen fire assay method. All reported 
analyses from 2007 to 2009 were carried out by ALS Chemex in North Vancouver B.C. ALS Chemex is an 
internationally-recognized analytical service provider compliant with ISO 9001:2000 for the provision of 
assay  and  geochemical  services.  The  Vancouver  laboratory  has  also  been  accredited  to  ISO  17025 
standards  for  specific  laboratory  procedures  by  the  Standards  Council  of  Canada.  The  2010  analytical 
work was completed by Eco-Tech Laboratory Ltd., then owned by The Stewart Group Global, which is 
fully accredited to ISO 9001-2008. In addition to laboratory standards, Astral has included independently 
prepared  standards  into  the  sample  sequence  to  assure  proper  quality  assurance/quality  control 
("QA/QC"). Drill core samples from the 2014 Orex drilling program were either split or cut and analyzed 
for  gold  by  screen  fire  method  or  standard  fire  assay  at  the  logging  geologists'  discretion.   As  with 
previous programs, independently prepared standards and site prepared blanks were inserted into the 
sample sequence to ensure program QA/QC.
The  exploration  work  at  the  Jumping  Josephine  Claims  was  completed  under  the  supervision  of  Dale 
Brittliffe, B.Sc., P.Geo., a Qualified Person as defined in NI 43-101.

DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STRUCTURE
As  at  the  close  of  business  on  August  21,  2015,  101,890,199  Orex  Shares  were  issued  and  outstanding. 
Pursuant to the Arrangement, all outstanding Orex Shares as at the Effective Date will be exchanged for 
New  Common  Shares.  See  "The  Meeting  –  The  Arrangement  –  Principal  Steps  of  the  Arrangement"  in  the 
Circular.
The share capital of Orex after the arrangement will remain unchanged as a result of the completion of 
the Arrangement, other than with respect to the issuance of the New Common Shares and elimination of 
the Orex Shares pursuant to the Arrangement.
The  TSX-V  has  conditionally  approved  the  listing  of  the  New  Common  Shares  to  be  issued  under  the 
Arrangement  and  issuable  on  exercise  of  the  New  Orex  Options  and  New  Orex  Warrants  after 
completion  of  the  Arrangement,  subject  to  filing  certain  documents  following  the  closing  of  the 
Arrangement.
At the Effective Time, the authorized share structure of Orex will consist of an unlimited number of New 
Common Shares, of which 101,890,199 New Common Shares are expected to be issued upon completion 
of the Arrangement.
See  "Financial  Statements  –  Selected  Orex  Unaudited  Pro  Forma  Financial  Information"  for  a  table  that 
describes and summarizes the expected share capital of Orex following completion of the Arrangement.
Following the Arrangement, Orex Shareholders will have exchanged their Orex Shares for New Common 
Shares and Spinco Shares.  Orex expects  that an aggregate of 101,890,199 New Common Shares  will be
E-12
issued in respect of the 101,890,199 Orex Shares outstanding as at August 21, 2015. Orex expects that an 
aggregate  of  up  to  20,937,680  New  Common  Shares  will  be  issued  or  issuable  in  respect  of  the  Orex 
Options  to  acquire  6,294,000  Orex  Shares  and  14,643,680  Orex  Warrants  outstanding  as  at  August  21, 
2015.
Common Shares
All of the New Common Shares will be of the same class and, once issued, rank equally as to dividends, 
voting powers and participation in assets and in all other respects, on liquidation, dissolution or winding 
up of Orex, whether voluntary or involuntary, or any other distribution of the assets of Orex among its 
shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs after Orex has paid out its liabilities. The issued 
New Common Shares  will not be subject to call or assessment by Orex nor are there any pre-emptive, 
conversion, exchange, redemption or retraction rights attaching to the New Common Shares.
All registered New Orex Shareholders will be entitled to receive notice of any general or special meeting 
to be convened by Orex. At any general or special meeting, subject to the restrictions on joint registered 
owners of New Common  Shares, each holder of New Common Shares will be entitled to one vote per 
share for each New Common Share of which it is the registered owner and may exercise such votes either 
in person or by proxy. Otherwise, on a show of hands every New Orex Shareholder who is present in 
person and entitled to vote will have one vote, and on a poll every New Orex Shareholder will have one 
vote  for  each  New  Common  Share  of  which  it  is  the  registered  owner.  Orex's  articles,  after  the 
Arrangement, will provide that the rights and provisions attached to any class of shares, in which shares 
are issued, may not be modified, amended or varied unless consented to by special resolution passed by a 
majority of not less than two-thirds of the votes cast in person or by proxy by holders of shares of that 
class.
Warrants
In  connection  with  the  Arrangement,  all  Orex  Warrants  outstanding  immediately  before  the  Effective 
Time  which  have  not  been  duly  exercised  will  be  and  will  be  deemed  to  be  exchanged  for  New  Orex 
Warrants and Spinco Warrants. Each New Orex Warrant will entitle the holder thereof to purchase from 
Orex one New Common Share at a purchase price per New Common Share equal to the exercise price of 
the Orex Warrant for which such New Orex Warrant was exchanged. The expiry date of each New Orex 
Warrant will be the same as the expiry date of the Orex Warrant for which such New Orex Warrant was 
exchanged. All other terms and conditions of the New Orex Warrants will be as set out in the form of 
New  Orex  Warrant  Certificate  attached  as  Schedule  C  of  the  Arrangement  Agreement,  which  can  be 
found under Orex's SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com.
Orex expects that New Orex Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 14,643,680 New Common Shares will 
be outstanding following completion of the Arrangement in respect of the Orex Warrants outstanding as 
at August 21, 2015, representing approximately 11.9% of the 101,890,199 New Common Shares expected 
to be outstanding following completion of the Arrangement on a fully-diluted basis.
New Orex Option Plan and New Orex Options
Subject  to  Orex  Securityholder  Approval,  the  only  equity  compensation  plan  Orex  will  have  after  the 
Arrangement is the New  Orex Option Plan. The New Orex Option Plan will be established to provide 
incentive to employees, directors, officers, management companies, and consultants who provide services 
to Orex or any of its subsidiaries. The TSX-V requires that all companies listed on the TSX-V adopt a stock 
option plan if they wish to grant options, and that all stock option plans that reserve a maximum of 10% 
of the issued and outstanding share capital of the issuer must be approved and ratified by shareholders
E-13
on an annual basis. See "The Meeting – The Arrangement – Orex Option Plan and Treatment of Orex Options" 
for information on how New Orex Options will be issued.
Under the New Orex Option Plan, the total number of New Common Shares allotted and reserved for 
future issuance will not exceed 10% of the issued and outstanding share capital of Orex from time to time.
Terms of the New Orex Option Plan
The following is a summary of the material terms of the New Orex Option Plan:
Number of Shares Reserved: The number of New Common Shares reserved for issuance under the New 
Orex Option  Plan  will  not exceed 10% of the number of New Common Shares outstanding (on a non-
diluted basis) at any given time.
Administration: The New Orex Option Plan will be administered by the New Orex Board.
Eligible Persons: Stock options may only be issued to directors, senior officers, employees of Orex or any 
of its Subsidiaries; consultants engaged by Orex or any of its Subsidiaries at the time a New Orex Option 
is  granted;  or  a  company  that  is  wholly-owned  by any  of  the  foregoing.  Such  persons  and  entities  are 
referred to herein as "Eligible Persons".
Board Discretion: The  number of New Common Shares subject to each  New  Orex Option, the exercise 
price,  the  expiry  time,  the  extent  to  which  such  New  Orex  Option  is  exercisable,  and  other  terms  and 
conditions relating to such New Orex Option will be determined by the New Orex Board.
Maximum  Term  of  Options:  Options  granted  under  the  New  Orex  Option  Plan  will  be  for  a  term  not 
exceeding five years from the date of grant.
Maximum Options per Person: The number  of New  Common Shares reserved  for issuance to any  one 
option  holder  pursuant  to  New  Orex  Options  granted  under  the  New  Orex  Option  Plan  during  any 
twelve-month  period  may  not  exceed  5%  (or,  in  the  case  of  a  consultant,  2%)  of  the  issued  and 
outstanding New Common Shares at the time of grant. The number of New Common Shares reserved for 
issuance to employees who are engaged in Investor Relations Activities is limited to an aggregate of 2% 
of the issued and outstanding New Common Shares at the time of grant.
No Assignment: The New Orex Options may not be assigned or transferred.
Termination Before Expiry: Generally, New Orex Options will expire and terminate on a date stipulated 
by the New Orex Board at the time of grant. If the employment of an option holder who is an Eligible 
Person  is  terminated  without  cause,  such  option  holder's  New  Orex  Options  (vested  or  unvested)  will 
terminate 90 days following notice of termination or on the expiry of such New Orex Options, whichever 
is earlier.  If the employment of an option holder who is an Eligible Person is terminated for cause, such 
option holder's New Orex Options (vested or unvested) will terminate on the day of termination.  If the 
employment  of  an  option  holder  who  is  engaged  in  Investor  Relations  Activities  is  terminated,  such 
option  holder's  New  Orex  Options  (vested  or  unvested)  will  terminate  30  days  following  notice  of 
termination or on the expiry of such New Orex Options, whichever is earlier.  If an option holder dies, the 
vested New Orex Options of the deceased option holder will be exercisable by his/her estate for a period 
not exceeding 12 months following the date of the deceased option holder's death or on the expiry of such 
vested New Orex Options, whichever is earlier.  If an option holder ceases to become an Eligible person 
by virtue of disability, the New Orex Board may allow such option holder to exercise any vested New 
Orex Options for a period not exceeding 12 months following the date of such option holder ceasing to be 
an Eligible Person or on the expiry of such vested New Orex Options, whichever is earlier.  Upon any
E-14
attempt to transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of a New Orex Option, such New 
Orex Option will, at the election of Orex, cease and terminate.
Exercise Price: Subject to any adjustments made pursuant to the New Orex Option Plan and excluding 
the New Orex Options exchanged for Orex Options outstanding as of the Effective Time pursuant to the 
Arrangement,  New  Orex  Options  granted  under  the  terms  of  the  New  Orex  Option  Plan  will  be 
exercisable at a price that is not less than the market price of the New Common Shares on the TSX-V.
Full Payment for Shares: Orex will not issue New Common Shares pursuant to the exercise of New Orex 
Options  granted  under  the  New  Orex  Option  Plan  unless  and  until  the  exercise  price  for  those  New 
Common Shares has been fully paid.
Reduction  of  Exercise  Price:  The  exercise  price  of  New  Orex  Options  granted  to  insiders  may  not  be 
decreased without disinterested shareholder approval.
Change of Control:  If a Change of Control Event (as defined in the New Orex Option Plan occurs, then 
the New Orex Board may authorize and implement one or more of the following actions: (a) accelerate 
the vesting of any New Orex Options and any New Orex Options that are not exercised or surrendered 
by the effective time of the Change of Control Event will be deemed to have expired; (b) offer to acquire 
from  each  option  holder  his  or  her  New  Orex  Options  for  a  cash  payment  equal  to  the  In  the  Money 
Amount  (as  defined  in  the  New  Orex  Option  Plan)  and  any  New  Orex  Options  that  are  not  so 
surrendered by the effective time of the Change of Control Event will be deemed to have expired; and/or 
(c) deem that a New Orex Option granted under the New Orex Option Plan be exchanged for an option 
to acquire, for the same exercise price, that number and type of securities as would be distributed to a 
holder of New Orex Options in respect of the New Common Shares issued to such option holder had he 
or she exercised the New Orex Option before the effective time of the Change of Control Event, provided 
that any such replacement option must provide that it survives for a period of not less than one year from 
the effective time of the Change of Control Event, regardless of the continuing directorship, officership or 
employment of the option holder.
Termination of Plan: The New Orex Option Plan will terminate when it is terminated by Orex. Any New 
Orex Options outstanding when the New Orex Option Plan is terminated will remain in effect until they 
are exercised or they expire.
As  at  the  date  hereof,  Orex  has  reserved  6,294,000  Orex  Shares  pursuant  to  outstanding  Orex  Options 
under the Orex Option Plan, and to the extent such Orex Options are not exercised prior to the Effective 
Date, such Orex Options will be exchanged for New Orex Options on the Effective Date.
Dividends or Distributions
Orex has not paid any dividends on the Orex Shares since incorporation. Orex's management anticipates 
that  Orex  will  retain  all  future  earnings  and  other  cash  resources  for  the  future  operation  and 
development of its business. Orex does not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable 
future.  Payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of the New Orex Board after taking into 
account many factors, including Orex's operating results, financial condition and current and anticipated 
cash needs.
ESCROWED SECURITIES
There are no securities of Orex that are held in escrow or that are subject to a contractual restriction on 
transfer, and Orex expects that no such securities of Orex will be held in escrow on the Effective Date.

RISK FACTORS
An investment in New Common Shares, as well as Orex's prospects, is highly speculative due to the 
high-risk nature of its business and the present stage of its development. New Orex Shareholders may 
lose their entire investment. The risks described below are not the only ones that will face Orex after the 
Arrangement. Additional risks  not currently  known to Orex,  or that  Orex currently deems  immaterial, 
may also impair Orex's operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, Orex's business, financial 
condition and operating results could be adversely affected.
Orex Shareholders should consult with their professional advisors to assess the Arrangement and their 
resulting investment in Orex. In evaluating Orex and its business and whether to vote in favour of the 
Arrangement,  Orex  Shareholders  should  carefully  consider,  in  addition  to  the  other  information 
contained  in  the  Circular  and  this  Appendix  E,  the  risk  factors  which  follow,  as  well  as  the  risks 
associated with the Arrangement (see in the Circular "The Meeting – The Arrangement — Risks Associated 
with the Arrangement").  These risk factors may not be a definitive list of all risk factors associated with the 
Arrangement, an investment in Orex or in connection with Orex's business and operations.
E-19
Exploration and Development Risks
All of Orex's operations will continue to involve exploration and development and there is no guarantee 
that any such activity will result in commercial production of mineral deposits. Mineral exploration and 
development  involves  substantial  expenses  and  a  high  degree  of  risk,  which  even  a  combination  of 
experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to adequately mitigate. Most exploration 
projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable deposits. There is no certainty that the 
expenditures made or to be made by Orex in the exploration and development of the mineral properties 
will result in the discovery of gold, silver or other mineralized materials in commercial quantities. While 
discovery of a gold or silver deposit may result in substantial rewards, few properties that are explored 
are ultimately developed into producing mines. Major expenses may be required to establish reserves by 
drilling and to construct mining and processing facilities at a site. It is impossible to ensure that Orex's 
current exploration programs will result in profitable commercial mining operations.
The commercial viability of a mineral deposit is also dependent upon a number of factors, some of which 
are  the  particular  attributes  of  the  deposit,  such  as  size,  grade  and  proximity  to  infrastructure,  metal 
prices  which  are  highly  cyclical  and  government  regulations,  including  regulations  relating  to  prices, 
taxes,  royalties,  allowable  production,  land  tenure,  land  use,  importing  and  exporting  of  minerals  and 
environmental  protection.    The  exact  effect  of  these  factors  cannot  be  accurately  predicted,  but  the 
negative combination of these factors may result in  Orex not receiving an adequate return on invested 
capital.  There  is  no  certainty  that  expenditures  made  by  Orex  will  result  in  discoveries  of  commercial 
quantities of ore.
Title Risks
There can be no assurance that the interest held by Orex in the properties is free from defects. Orex has 
investigated  its  rights  to  explore  and  exploit  the  properties  and  has  caused  standard  forms  of  title 
opinions to be obtained.  To the best of Orex's knowledge, those rights are in good standing. However, 
there  is  no  assurance  that  such  rights  will  not  be  revoked  or  significantly  altered  to  Orex's  detriment. 
There can be no assurance that Orex's rights will not be challenged or impugned by third parties. The 
mineral  property  interests  comprising  Orex's  properties  have  not  been  surveyed,  and  as  such  their 
location and boundaries may be in doubt.
Market Price of Gold, Silver and Other Metals
Orex's  long-term  viability  and  future  profitability  will  depend,  in  large  part,  upon  the  market  price  of 
gold and other metals and minerals produced from its mineral properties. The market price of gold and 
other metals is volatile and is impacted by numerous factors beyond Orex's control, including:
(cid:120) 
(cid:120) 
(cid:120) 
(cid:120) 
(cid:120) 
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
expectations with respect to the rate of inflation; 
the relative strength of the Canadian dollar and certain other currencies; 
interest rates; 
global or regional political or economic conditions; 
supply and demand for jewelry and industrial products containing metals; 
sales by central banks and other holders, speculators and producers of gold and other metals in 
response to any of the above factors; and 
any executive order curtailing the production or sale of gold.
The volatility of  mineral prices represents a substantial risk which no amount of planning  or technical 
expertise  can  fully  eliminate.  In  the  event  gold  prices  decline  or  remain  low  for  prolonged  periods  of 
time, Orex may be unable to develop its properties, which may adversely affect its results of operations, 
financial performance and cash flows.
E-20
A decrease in the market price of gold and other metals could affect the commercial viability of Orex's 
properties and its anticipated development of such properties in the future. Lower gold prices could also 
adversely affect Orex's ability to finance exploration and development of its properties.
Global Economy
Recent market events and conditions, including disruptions in the international credit markets and other 
financial  systems  and  the  deterioration  of  global  economic  conditions,  could  impede  Orex's  access  to 
capital  or  increase  the  cost  of  capital.  From  2007  to  2009,  the  United  States  credit  markets  began  to 
experience  serious  disruption  due  to  deterioration  in  residential  property  values,  defaults  and 
delinquencies in the residential mortgage market and a decline in the credit quality of mortgage-backed 
securities.  These  problems  led  to  a  slow-down  in  residential  housing  market  transactions,  declining 
housing  prices,  delinquencies  in  non-mortgage  consumer  credit  and  a  general  decline  in  consumer 
confidence. These conditions caused a loss of confidence in the broader United States and global credit 
and  financial  markets  and  resulted  in  the  collapse  of,  and  government  intervention  in,  major  banks, 
financial institutions and insurers and created a climate of greater volatility, less liquidity, widening of 
credit spreads, a lack  of price transparency, increased credit losses and tighter credit conditions which 
continued  throughout  2012  with  continued  uncertainty  in  the  European  marketplace  and  continued 
uncertainty surrounding the "fiscal cliff" and United States government spending cuts. Notwithstanding 
various actions by the United States and foreign governments, concerns about the general condition of 
the  capital  markets,  financial  instruments,  banks,  investment  banks,  insurers  and  other  financial 
institutions caused the broader credit markets to deteriorate and stock markets to fluctuate substantially.
These  disruptions  in  the  current  credit  and  financial  markets  have  had  a  significant  material  adverse 
impact  on  a  number  of  financial  institutions  and  have  limited  access  to  capital  and  credit  for  many 
companies,  including  junior  mining  companies.  These  disruptions  could,  among  other  things,  make  it 
more difficult for Orex to obtain, or increase its cost of obtaining, capital and financing for its operations. 
Access to additional capital may not be available to Orex on terms acceptable to it, or at all.
Foreign Currency Fluctuations
Orex  will  continue  to  maintain  its  accounts  and  raise  its  capital  funding  through  the  sale  of  equity 
securities in Canadian dollars. Orex's exploration operations in Canada and Mexico are paid for in either 
Canadian dollars, Mexican pesos or United States dollars. Orex is therefore subject to foreign currency 
exchange  fluctuations  relative  to  the  Mexican  peso,  as  well  as  the  United  States  dollar,  which  may 
materially affect Orex's financial position and operating results.  Further, there is no guarantee that the 
governments  of  Mexico,  or  any  other  foreign  government  in  which  Orex  carries  on  business,  will  not 
impose restrictions on the convertibility of or obligations to remit and convert into the local currency in 
the  future,  which  may  also  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  Orex's  financial  position  and  operations. 
Orex does not currently have a formal hedging program to mitigate foreign currency exchange risks.
Environmental Regulation
Orex will continue to be subject to substantial environmental and other regulatory requirements and such 
regulations  are  becoming  more  stringent.  All  phases  of  development  operations  are  subject  to 
environmental regulations. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner which will require stricter 
standards  and  enforcement,  increased  fines  and  penalties  for  non-compliance,  more  stringent 
environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies 
and their officers, directors and employees. There is no assurance that future changes in environmental 
regulations, if any, will not adversely affect Orex's operations. Environmental hazards may exist on the 
properties  which are presently unknown to Orex and which have been caused  by previous or existing 
owners or operators of the properties.
E-21
Competition
The international mining industry is highly competitive. The mining industry is global and consists of a 
small, decreasing number of large players. Competition for new mining properties by these larger, more 
established  companies  may  prevent  Orex  from  acquiring  interests  in  additional  properties  or  mining 
operations.  Significant and increasing competition exists for mineral acquisition opportunities in Canada 
and  Mexico.  As  a  result  of  this  competition,  some  of  which  is  with  larger,  more  established  mining 
companies  with  substantial  capabilities  and  greater  financial  and  technical  resources  than  Orex,  Orex 
may be unable to acquire rights to exploit additional attractive mining properties on terms Orex considers 
acceptable.    Accordingly,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  Orex  will  acquire  any  interest  in  additional 
operations that would yield reserves or result in commercial mining operations.
Management
The success of Orex will continue to be largely dependent on the performance of its officers. The loss of 
the  services  of  these  persons  would  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  Orex's  business  and  prospects. 
There is no assurance Orex will maintain the services of its officers or other qualified personnel required 
to operate its business.
Key Person Insurance
Orex  does  not  maintain  key  person  insurance  on  any  of  its  directors  or  officers,  and,  as  a  result  Orex 
would bear the full loss and expense of hiring and replacing any director or officer in the event of the loss 
of any such Persons by their resignation, retirement, incapacity, or death, as well as any loss of business 
opportunity or other costs suffered by Orex from such loss of any director or officer.
Dividends
Orex currently intends to retain future earnings to finance the operation, development and expansion of 
its  business.  Orex  does  not  anticipate  paying  cash  dividends  on  the  New  Common  Shares  in  the 
foreseeable future. Payment of future cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of the  New Orex 
Board and will depend on Orex's financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, capital 
requirements,  business  prospects  and  other  factors  that  the  New  Orex  Board  may  consider  relevant. 
Accordingly, investors will only see a return on their investment if the value of the New Common Shares 
appreciates.
Conflicts of Interest
Some of the directors and officers of Orex are engaged and will continue to be engaged as directors and 
officers of Orex in the search for additional business opportunities on behalf of other corporations, and 
situations may arise where these directors and officers will be in direct competition with Orex. Conflicts, 
if any, will be dealt with in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Business Corporations Act.
Some  of  the  directors  and  officers of  Orex  are  or  may  become  directors  or  officers  of  other  companies 
engaged in other business ventures, including Spinco. In order to avoid the possible conflict of interest 
which may arise between the directors' duties to Orex and their duties to the other companies on whose 
boards they serve, the directors and officers of Orex have agreed to the following:
(cid:120)
participation  in  other  business  ventures  offered  to  the  directors  and  officers  will  be  allocated 
between the various companies and on the basis of prudent business judgment and the relative 
financial abilities and needs of the companies to participate;
E-22
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
no commissions or other extraordinary consideration will be paid to such directors and officers; 
and
business  opportunities  formulated  by  or  through  other  companies  in  which  the  directors  and 
officers are involved will not be offered to Orex, except on the same or better terms than the basis 
on which they are offered to third party participants.
Impact of Hedging Activities on Profitability
Although Orex has no present intention to do so, it may hedge a portion of any of its future gold or silver 
production  to  protect  Orex  against  low  prices  and/or  to  satisfy  covenants  required  to  obtain  project 
financings. Hedging activities are intended to protect Orex from the fluctuations of the price of gold or 
silver  and  to  minimize  the  effect  of  declines  in  prices  on  results  of  operations  for  a  period  of  time. 
Although hedging activities may protect a company against low prices, they may also limit the price that 
can be realized on that mineral that is subject to forward sales and call options where the market price of 
gold or silver exceeds the price in a forward sale or call option contract.
Influence of Third Party Stakeholders
The lands in which Orex holds or will acquire an interest, or the exploration equipment and road or other 
means  of  access  which  Orex  intends  to  utilize  in  carrying  out  its  work  programs  or  general  business 
mandates,  may  be  subject  to  interests  or  claims  by  third  parties.  If  any  such  third  parties  assert  any 
claims, Orex's work programs may be delayed even if such claims are not meritorious. Such delays may 
result in significant financial loss and loss of opportunity for Orex.
Political and Economic Instability in Foreign Countries
Orex's  properties  after  the  Arrangement  will  be  located  in  Canada  and  Mexico  and  Orex  may  acquire 
mineral property interests in other foreign countries. Exploration in foreign jurisdictions will expose Orex 
to risks that may not otherwise be experienced if all operations were domestic. The risks include, but are 
not limited to military repression, extreme fluctuations in currency exchange rates, labour instability or 
militancy,  socioeconomic  conditions,  mineral  title  irregularities  and  high  rates  of  inflation.  In  addition, 
changes in mining or investment policies, or shifts in political attitude in foreign countries in which Orex 
operates  may  adversely  affect  its  business.  The  distribution  of  earnings  back  to  Canada  would  require 
Mexican currency to be reconverted to foreign currency for repatriation. Orex may be affected in varying 
degrees  by  government  regulation  with  respect  to  restrictions  on  production,  price  controls,  export 
controls,  income  taxes,  expropriation  of  property,  maintenance  of  exploration  or  mining  rights, 
environmental legislation, land use, land claims of local people, water use and mine safety.  The effect of 
these factors cannot be accurately predicted. Political risks may adversely affect Orex's existing assets and 
operations. Orex does not maintain and Orex does not intend to purchase political risk insurance. Real 
and  perceived  political  risks  in  some  countries  may  also  affect  Orex's  ability  to  finance  exploration 
programs and attract joint venture partners and may affect future mine development opportunities.
Price Volatility
Securities  markets  have  recently  had  a  high  level  of  price  and  volume  volatility,  and  the  securities  of 
many companies have experienced wide fluctuations in price which have not necessarily been related to 
the operating performance, underlying asset values or prospects of such companies. Factors unrelated to 
the  financial  performance  or  prospects  of  Orex  may  include  macroeconomic  developments  locally  and 
globally, and market perceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries. There can be no assurance 
that continued fluctuations in mineral prices will not occur. As a result of any of these factors, the market
E-23
price  of  the  New  Common  Shares  at  any  given  point in  time  may  not  accurately  reflect  the  long  term 
value of Orex.
In  the  past,  following  periods  of  volatility  in  the  market  price  of  a  company's  securities,  shareholders 
have in some cases instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if 
instituted, could result in substantial cost and diversion of management attention and resources, which 
could significantly harm profitability and the reputation of Orex.
Dilution
Orex  will  require  additional  funds  in  respect  of  the  further  development  of  Orex's  mineral  projects.  If 
Orex raises funds by issuing additional equity securities, such financing will dilute the equity interests of 
its shareholders.
Discretion in the Use of Available Funds
Management will have broad discretion concerning the use of the available funds of Orex as well as the 
timing of their expenditures. As a result, shareholders and investors will be relying on the judgment of 
management of Orex on completion of the Arrangement for the application of the available funds of Orex 
(see "Available Funds and Principal Purposes" above).  Management may use the available funds in ways 
that  an  investor  may  not  consider  desirable.  The  results  and  the  effectiveness  of  the  application  of  the 
available  funds  are  uncertain.  If  the  available  funds  are  not  applied  effectively,  Orex's  results  of 
operations may suffer.
Joint Venture Risk
Certain of the properties  in which  Orex has an interest are operated through  joint ventures with other 
mining  companies  and  are  subject  to  the  risks  normally  associated  with  the  conduct  of  joint  ventures. 
Such risks include: inability to exert control over strategic decisions made in respect of such properties; 
disagreement with partners on how to develop and operate mines efficiently; inability of partners to meet 
their  obligations  to  the  joint  venture  or  third  parties;  and  litigation  between  partners  regarding  joint 
venture matters. Any failure of such other companies to meet their obligations to Orex or to third parties, 
or  any  disputes  with  respect  to  the  parties'  respective  rights  and  obligations,  could  have  a  material 
adverse effect on the joint ventures or their respective properties, which could have a material adverse 
effect on Orex.

Project Description
The Barsele Project, located near Storuman, Sweden, is currently 100% owned by Gunnarn, 45% of 
which is owned by Orex and 55% of which is indirectly owned by Agnico Eagle. The Barsele Project 
includes the Central-Avan-Skiråsen gold deposits ("CAS") and the Norra VMS deposit (copper, lead, 
zinc, gold and silver). Total area for the exploration permits is 28,405 hectares plus 134.5 hectares in 
exploitation concessions. These are also 164 hectares of permits with a prohibited status.
F-2
Project Location Map
The Barsele Central Gold Deposit, discovered in 1988, is located west of Lake Skirträsket and consists 
of the Central, Avan and Skiråsen deposits extending over a strike length of 2.6 km. The Norra VMS 
Deposit is located to the north of Barsele Central, Avan and Skiråsen mineralized zones.
The  authors  of  the  Barsele  Technical  Report  were  retained  by  Orex  and  Barsele  to  evaluate  the 
exploration results of the Barsele Project and render independent recommendations for further work 
in a technical report in the form required by NI 43-101. The authors reviewed data provided by Orex. 
Michael  Collins  conducted  a  site  visit  on  November  6  and  7,  2012  to  confirm  the  data  and 
mineralization and review the project site.
Project Ownership
On  October  27,  2010,  Orex  signed  a  letter  of  intent  with  Northland  Exploration  Sweden  AB 
(previously  named  Barsele  Guld  AB)  ("Northland"),  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  Northland 
Resources  S.E.  (previously  named  Northland  Resources  S.A.),  to  earn  100%  interest  in  the  Barsele 
Project subject to certain terms. Orex and Northland entered into a share sale agreement dated March 
22,  2011  (the  "Barsele  Agreement"),  whereby,  among  other  things,  Orex  was  to  acquire  100% 
ownership  of  Gunnarn,  the  owner  of  the  claims  comprising  the  Barsele  Project.  The  Barsele 
Agreement was approved on April 29, 2011 by the TSX-V. On October 1, 2013, Orex entered into an 
agreement  (the  "Amended Barsele Agreement")  with  Northland  to  amend  the  Barsele  Agreement.
F-3
Under the terms of the Amended Barsele Agreement, Orex satisfied the remaining cash payments to 
be  made  to  Northland  by  the  payment  of  US$250,000  in  cash  and  the  issuance  of  7,500,000  Orex 
Shares  at  a  deemed  price  of  US$0.50  per  Orex  Share.  The  TSX-V  approved  the  Amended  Barsele 
Agreement  and  Orex  issued  the  7,500,000  Orex  Shares  to  Northland,  which  were  subject  to  a  hold 
period that concluded on February 22, 2014.
Northland  had  the  right  to  receive  certain  NSR  royalties  (the  "Northland  Royalties")  pursuant  to 
three  royalty  agreements  between  Northland  and  Gunnarn  dated  October  16,  2007  (collectively, 
the "Northland  Royalty Agreements"),  the  terms  of  which  were  amended  by  an  option  agreement 
(the "Northland Option Agreement") dated April 29, 2011 between Northland, Orex and Gunnarn. 
On September 15, 2014, Northland and Gunnarn mutually agreed to terminate the Northland Royalty 
Agreements  and  the  Northland  Option  Agreement  and  to  transfer  all  rights  of  Northland  to  the 
Northland  Royalties  to  Gunnarn  in  consideration  for  a  payment  of  US$500,000  to  Northland  by 
Gunnarn.
On February 19, 2015, Orex and Agnico Eagle entered into a letter of intent setting out the terms of a 
proposed  joint  venture  transaction  whereby  AE  Sweden,  an  indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of 
Agnico  Eagle,  would  acquire  an  initial  55%  joint  venture  interest  in  the  Barsele  Project.  Orex  and 
Agnico Eagle subsequently negotiated a term sheet, which was finalized on April 30, 2015 and which 
set  out  the  terms  for  a  definitive  share  purchase,  joint  venture  agreement  and  royalty  agreements 
among  Orex,  Agnico  Eagle,  AE  Sweden  and  Gunnarn.  On  June  11,  2015,  the  Gunnarn  JV  was 
completed  and  Agnico  Eagle,  through  AE  Sweden,  acquired  a  55%  interest  in  Gunnarn  in 
consideration  of  an  initial  payment  to  Orex  of  US$6,000,000.  An  additional  US$2,000,000  will  be 
payable  by  AE  Sweden,  or  by  Agnico  Eagle  on  AE  Sweden's  behalf,  to  Orex  in  cash  or  common 
shares of Agnico Eagle at AE Sweden's election on each of the first and second anniversaries of the 
closing  of  the  Gunnarn  JV.  The  right  to  receive  such  future  payments  under  the  share  purchase 
agreement will be retained by Orex after completion of the Arrangement.
As part of the Gunnarn JV and in accordance with the terms of the Gunnarn JV Agreement among 
Orex,  Gunnarn,  Agnico  Eagle  and  AE  Sweden,  which  is  available  for  public  viewing  on  Orex's 
SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com and is incorporated by reference into this Appendix F, AE Sweden 
has  committed  to  spend  US$7,000,000  on  Barsele  Project  expenditures  over  three  years.  Under  the 
Gunnarn  JV  Agreement,  AE  Sweden  may  make  a  cash  payment  to  Orex  to  satisfy  any  required 
Barsele  Project  expenditures  that  it  does  not  otherwise  make.    Spinco  will  be  assigned  the  right  to 
receive  any  such  payments  as  part  of  the  Spinco  Reorganization.  Pursuant  to  the  Gunnarn  JV 
Agreement, if Agnico Eagle or AE Sweden prepares a pre-feasibility study on the Barsele Project and 
contributes it to Gunnarn, AE Sweden's interest in Gunnarn will increase to 70% and Orex's interest 
in  Gunnarn  will  be  reduced  to  30%.  Until  such  pre-feasibility  study  is  contributed  to  Gunnarn  by 
Agnico Eagle or AE Sweden, all costs and expenses of Gunnarn will be for the account of AE Sweden 
and, following the completion of such pre-feasibility study, all costs and expenses of Gunnarn will be 
shared  by  AE  Sweden  and  Orex  in  accordance  with  their  proportionate  interest  in  Gunnarn.  In 
accordance  with  the  Gunnarn  JV  Agreement,  AE  Sweden  is  the  operator  of  the  Barsele  Project  for 
customary compensation and has a majority of seats on Gunnarn's board of directors.  
In connection with the Gunnarn JV, Orex was also assigned a 2% NSR on production from the Barsele 
Project  which  may  be  repurchased  by  Agnico  at  any  time  for  US$5,000,000.  The  royalty  will  be 
retained by Orex after completion of the Arrangement.
For more details regarding the Gunnarn JV Agreement, see "Description of the Business - Gunnarn JV 
Agreement" below.

Property Location, Infrastructure and Access
The  Barsele  Project  is  located  approximately  20  km  east-southeast  of  the  town  of  Storuman  in 
Västerbottens  Län,  Sweden.  Regionally  the  Barsele  Project  is  situated  approximately  210  km  from 
Umeå,  population  105,000 and  the  administrative  headquarters  of  Västerbotten  County;  and  about 
800 km north of Stockholm. The geographic coordinates for the Project are about 65°05' north latitude 
and 17°30' east longitude.
Property Geology and Mineralization
The  Barsele  Project  area  is  overlain  with  a  thin  layer  of  glacial  till,  and  consequently  geological 
interpretations  rely  heavily  on  limited  outcrop,  drill-core  data,  geophysics  and  a  few  trenches 
excavated in the Central, Avan and Norra zones. The project is situated within the southeast-trending 
Umeå-River  shear  zone  and  parallels  this  dominant  structural  fabric,  which  controls  drainage  and 
glacial vectors.
The  project  area  covers  a  sequence  of  metasedimentary  and  metavolcanic  rocks  of  the  Proterozoic 
Svecofennian system. Three main phases of granitoid intrusions in the region are referred to as early, 
middle and post with respect to the Svecofennian orogeny. An early orogenic granodiorite is the host 
rock of the Barsele gold mineralization.
The  granodiorite  exhibits  a  well-developed  S2  penetrative  foliation,  which  is  cut  by  ductile  shear 
zones, faults, fractures and dilational quartz and quartz-carbonate sulphide veining. The granodiorite 
is  quartz-feldspar  phyric  and  is  composed  of  sericitized  plagioclase,  quartz,  biotite  and  lesser  K-
feldspar and in composition is quartz monzodiorite to granodiorite.
Gold mineralization at the Barsele Project is predominantly hosted within a medium-grained, highly 
fractured granodiorite that ranges in width from 200 to 500 m with a strike-extent in excess of some 8 
km. The intrusion bends from an east-west orientation in the east to a northwest trend in the west 
where the three major zones of gold mineralization have been identified. The Central and Skiråsen 
Zones  have  a  combined  strike  length  of  1.35  km  by  some  350  m  wide  while  the  Avan  Zone  has  a 
strike  length  of  1.4  km  and  a  width  of  250  m.  A  fourth  mineralized  gold  zone,  Skirträskbäcken,  is 
located approximately 3 km southeast of the Barsele Central Zone and extends into the Risberget gold 
prospect.
Two main styles of mineralization are interpreted at the Central, Avan, and Skiråsen Zone: (a) low to 
moderate grade gold mineralization associated with networks of thin tourmaline-quartz and quartz-
calcite-arsenopyrite veinlets in granodiorite; and (b) high-grade gold-silver-zinc-lead mineralization 
in syn-tectonic quartz-sulphide veins.  Most exploration in the Central and Avan Zones has focused 
on the low-grade gold resource and there remains potential for discovery of additional high-grade 
quartz-sulphide vein mineralization.
Gold occurs as native metal alloyed with silver, and has a general association with arsenopyrite but 
also occurs with pyrrhotite, calcite, chlorite and biotite. Base metal content of the deposit is typically 
low.  Carbonate,  sulphide  and  quartz-tourmaline  veinlets  are  locally  mineralized.  The  host-
granodiorite  contains  less  than  two  percent  disseminated  fine-grained  sulphides  consisting  of 
arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite and pyrite.
The  Norra  Zone  consists  of  massive  sulphide  mineralization  hosted  within  a  sequence  of  sheared 
felsic volcanics, foliated pyritic shales and pelitic sediments with a basal massive-sulphide zone and 
an  upper-zone  dominated  by  andesitic  volcanics.  The  footprint  of  the  main  mineralized  body  at
F-5
Norra, based on drilling, is some 300 m  in  strike-length varying from 5 to 50 m in width  within a 
broadly anomalous zone some 300 m in strike length by 50 m in width.
The  sulphide  mineralization  and  associated  alteration  is  likely  a  volcanic  hosted  massive  sulphide 
("V-HMS")  type.  Gold  is  associated  with  the  basal  semi-massive  arsenopyrite,  pyrrhotite, 
chalcopyrite,  galena,  and  sphalerite  mineralization.  Gold  is  probably  remobilized  and  is  likely 
enriched by a later overprinting epithermal phase of mineralization.
Deposit Type & Exploration Concept
There  are  a  number  of  different  styles  of  gold  deposits  within  the  Svecofennian  Shield,  Skellefteå 
district of northern Sweden such as:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
intrusion related gold systems;
volcanic-hosted massive sulphide;
high-sulphidation epithermal; and
mesothermal vein-type.
It is probable that a host of different mineral forming systems were active at the Barsele Project and 
the nearby Skellefteå district including the dominant V-HMS, epithermal and mesothermal systems. 
Historically  the  Skellefteå  district  is  known  to contain  some  80  separate  volcanic  massive  sulphide 
and lode gold occurrences loosely aligned in an east west orientation.  The Barsele Project is located 
at  the  intersection  of  the  Skellefteå  belt  and  the  Gold  Line  trend.    Exploration  potential  of  the 
northwest-southeast  orientated  Gold  Line  trend  suite  of  lode  gold  deposits  has  only  recently  been 
recognized.
There are three broad styles of mineralization at the Barsele Project:
1.
2.
3.
Orogenic or mesothermal intrusive-hosted gold related to the Gold-Line Trend;
High-grade  gold-silver-lead-zinc  mineralization  hosted  by  syn-tectonic  quartz-sulphide 
veins; and
Epithermal gold-rich V-HMS regionally referred to as Skellefteå-style.
Regional  geochemical  till  sampling  followed  by  detailed  base-of-till  sampling  was  successful  in 
identifying anomalous gold concentrations both in surface and basal till at the Barsele CAS and Norra 
deposits.  These anomalies were subsequently drilled, leading to the identification of bedrock gold 
mineralization.  The  Barsele  Project  area  is  covered  by  a  thin  veneer  of  glacial  till.  None  of  the 
discoveries were exposed at the surface.
Reconnaissance, geochemical till sampling is an exploration technique utilized extensively in Sweden 
and has resulted in the discovery of a number of deposits including the nearby Björkdal gold mine.
In 1995, Terra Mining (a former owner), contracted Anamet Services to complete a mineralogical and 
preliminary metallurgical testwork on a one tonne bulk sample of mineralized rock excavated from a 
trench at the northwestern part of the Barsele Central Zone.  The average head-grade of the sample 
was 5.1 g/t gold and 4.3 g/t silver, considerably higher in grade than the historic Barsele Central drill 
grades  where  previous  drilling  programs  had  indicated  a  grade  of  about  1.5-2  g/t  gold.  No
F-6
conclusions  have  been  drawn  as  to  why  the  grades  are  so  different.  Coarse  gold  could  be  a 
contributing factor so future exploration must consider the possible influence of free gold in the host 
rock.
Further  exploration  by  Northland  included  ground  geophysical  surveys  to  augment  regional 
geophysics. The intrusive hosted CAS Zone is associated with a distinct magnetic anomaly low. The 
completed high resolution airborne geophysics followed by further ground geophysical surveys will 
assist  in  identifying  additional  similar  targets  in  areas  beyond  the  historic  ground  geophysical 
coverage.  The  Norra  V-HMS  target  is  associated  with  a  coincident  magnetic  and  electromagnetic 
anomaly and detailed airborne geophysics has identified areas of similar potential.
Drilling  of  past  geochemical  and  geophysical  anomalies  has  proven  successful  in  previous 
exploration  campaigns  and  will  continue  to  be  an  exploration  tool  utilized  in  future  exploration 
programs.    Detailed  geological  interpretation  including  structural  geology  also  must  be  utilized  in 
future exploration.
Status of Exploration Development and Operations
Orex  initiated  and  completed  an  airborne  survey  and  followed  up  targets  from  the  airborne  with 
ground  geophysics  on  the  Barsele  Project,  beginning  in  May  2011.  Orex  has  also  completed  a  drill 
campaign in late 2011 and 2012 on the Central and Avan zones totalling 6,210 m.
Past  work  has  outlined  four  deposits  by  utilizing  an  integrated  exploration  approach  of 
geochemistry, geophysics and drilling.  During 2005 Northland constructed a modern core handling 
and logging facility in Storuman with a core-sawing unit. Sample rejects, the master pulps and split 
core from the 2004, 2005 and 2006 drilling campaigns are retained on the project site in a secure and 
dry  facility.  Digital  photos  from  all  drilling  campaigns  are  retained  in  the  Storuman  office  and  on 
DVDs in a bank vault in Storuman.  Gunnarn has managed and stored their core and samples from 
the 2011 and 2012 drilling 8 km from the project in a cold storage facility.
At the same time Northland was completing their last drill program, they retained the Swedish office 
of Golder Associates, an independent international consulting firm, to complete the application for 
the  conversion  of  key  areas  of  the  property,  containing  the  four  known  deposits,  into  Exploitation 
Concessions.  This process consisted of field studies and investigatory work that were performed in 
order  to  apply  for  Exploitation  Concession  status  from  the  Mining  Inspectorate  of  Sweden.    The 
application  with  an  appended  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  ("EIA")  (Swedish:  MKB)  for 
Exploitation  Concession  was  submitted  Dec  27,  2006  and  it  was  granted  by  the  Swedish  Mining 
Inspector on June 21, 2007. An MKB is the first step in obtaining a permit to open a mine at Barsele.
On  February  28,  2011  Orex  released  the  results  of  an  updated  NI  43-101  resource  estimate.  The 
mineral  resources  were  estimated  by  Gary  Giroux,  P.Eng.,  M.A.Sc.  The  Norra  volcanic  massive 
sulphide ("VMS") zone, the Avan Gold zone, the Central and Central-Skiråsen zones were estimated 
separately.  The  Avan,  Central  and  Central-Skiråsen  zones  are  all  considered  to  be  structurally 
controlled mesothermal intrusive hosted gold deposits.
Further drilling was conducted in late 2011 and into the spring of 2012. On December 3, 2012 Orex 
released the results of an updated NI 43-101 resource estimate. The mineral resources were estimated 
by  Gary  Giroux,  P.Eng.,  M.A.Sc.  and  the  Avan  Gold  zone  were  Central  and  Skiråsen  zones  were 
estimated separately. The Norra VMS zone resource was unchanged from previous estimate in 2011. 
The Avan, Central and Skiråsen zones are all considered to be structurally controlled mesothermal 
intrusive hosted gold deposits.
F-7
Between  the  publishing  of  the  December  3,  2012  NI  43-101  resource  estimate  and  the  present 
estimates, Orex has conducted annual field sampling programs and desktop studies.

For  the  Avan,  Central  and  Skiråsen  estimates,  the  data  base  consisted  of  300  drillholes  completed 
between 1989 and 2006 totalling 34,210 m. In 2011 and 2012 an additional 16 drillholes totalling 6,210 
m were added by Orex. Presently 316 diamond drillholes totalling 40,420 m have been drilled and 
used to develop this 2012 mineral resource. Gold assays from each zone were capped based on their 
grade  distributions.    Downhole  composites,  3  m  in  length,  were  formed  for  each  zone.    The  Avan 
zone had a geologic three dimensional solid to constrain the estimation.  Variography was completed 
for gold, indicating an anisotropic structure with longest range NW-SE.  For the Central and Skiråsen 
zones, there was no current constraining three dimensional solid, so an indicator approach was used
F-8
to determine which blocks were above a gold cut-off.  Semivariogram analysis indicated the longest 
continuity along azimuth 150o.  A block model with blocks 3 m x 3 m x 3 m was superimposed over 
the three zones and gold grades were estimated by ordinary kriging.
The Norra VMS deposit, measuring 300 m along strike and from 5 to 50 m in width, was outlined by 
68  diamond  drillholes  completed  from  1990-2006,  thirty-nine  of  which  intersected  the  mineralized 
zone.  Assays for Au, Ag, Cu and Zn were capped and formed into 3 m composites.  Semivariograms 
were produced for each variable and all showed the longest range of continuity along azimuth 345o.  
A  3  m  x  3  m  x  3  m  block  model  was  placed  over  the  mineralized  VMS  solid,  and  grades  for  each 
variable were estimated by ordinary kriging.
A bulk density of 3.4 for the Norra VMS zone was derived from a 100 tonne bulk-test conducted by 
Boliden in 1992.  Golder established a specific gravity for the Central zone based on 2003 drill core.  
The  results  varied  from  2.70  to  2.75.    Because  these  tests  were  completed  on  crushed  material  the 
lower limit of 2.70 was used for this resource estimate.  It is recommended that an extensive specific 
gravity collection program be conducted on any future drill program on these properties.
In general, the classification of blocks into resource categories was made, based on the semivariogram 
range and the distance  of  samples from estimated blocks.   Blocks  within Avan, Central and Norra 
were  classified  as  indicated  if  estimated  in  search  ellipses  with  dimensions  up  to  ½  the 
semivariogram range.  All others were classified as inferred.  All estimated blocks at Skiråsen, which 
has been drilled on wider spaced lines, were classified as Inferred.
Conclusions and Recommendations
The  conclusions  and  recommendations  set  forth  in  the  Barsele  Technical  Report,  as  summarized  below,  are 
based on previous exploration programs undertaken on the Barsele Project by Orex and the previous owners of 
the Barsele Project prior to the acquisition by AE Sweden of a 55% joint venture interest in the Barsele Project.   
As the operator of the Barsele Project, AE Sweden is solely responsible for preparing, in accordance with the 
terms of the Gunnarn JV Agreement, work programs and budgets.  As the majority shareholder of Gunnarn, 
AE Sweden also controls which work programs and budgets and related matters, including those relating to 
exploration programs, development, capital expenditures,  production decisions, mining plans, and  expansion 
plans,  are  recommended  to  the  Gunnarn  Board  for  approval.    Pursuant  to  the  terms  of  the  Gunnarn  JV 
Agreement, the Gunnarn Board is bound to provide all approvals and make all decisions as are necessary to give 
effect to any such recommendations.  Orex and Barsele have been advised by AE Sweden that it does not intend 
to implement the recommendations set forth in the Barsele Technical Report.  It is anticipated that AE Sweden 
will present a new work plan and related budget to the Gunnarn Board in mid-September  2015.
Previous exploration programs undertaken on the Barsele Project have outlined four small deposits; 
three  gold  deposits:  Central,  Avan  and  Skiråsen,  and  the  Norra  V-HMS  deposit.  High  quality 
regional  targets  within  the  licenses  have  been  identified  that  require  further  work  such  as  the 
Skirträskbäcken- Risberget, Nasvattnet, Tattartjärnliden, and Storträsket.  In addition, Gunnarn has 
recently acquired 23,425 Ha of new ground that has  not been explored in the detail of the original 
property acquired from Northland and will need to be properly evaluated.  Some of this concession 
area has been allowed to lapse and more is awaiting decision by the government. It is concluded that 
further work is warranted over the entire property and the most effective way to test the targets is 
outlined  in  the  proposed  exploration  program  described  in  the  Barsele  Technical  Report  and 
includes:
F-9
Phase I
Phase  I  work  programs  would  include  orientation  geological  mapping  on  new  targets  developed 
from the airborne survey, further specific gravity determinations, trenching on Avan and elsewhere 
to map geological structures, upgrading of the 3-D computer model for the CAS and Norra deposits, 
further environmental studies and conceptual engineering studies.
Phase II
Diamond Drilling - A three pronged 8,850 m drilling program:
1.
2.
3.
drilling  south-west  dipping  holes  in  the  Central  Zone  to:  (a)  test  the  premise  that  the  Au 
mineralization  has  a  preferred  South-East  plunging  orientation;  and  (b)  extending  these  to 
depth;
a  three  hole  fence  on  Line  7200  between  the  Central  and  Avan  Zones;  testing  a  strong  IP 
anomaly and looking for a connection between the two zones; and
10 drillholes 200 m each dedicated to the regional exploration program which should be able 
to test 3 discrete targets and prioritized by the local geology team.
Underground Bulk Sample - Drill four large diameter (PQ size) core holes ± 100 m each in the CAS 
zone to:
1.
2.
provide material for preliminary metallurgical testing criteria; and
determine the location for a larger underground bulk sample (minimum 100 tonnes).
Regional Exploratory Diamond Drilling - 2,500 m drilling of outside targets such as Skirträskbäcken 
and Tattartjärnliden.
The  Phase  I  exploration  program  should  take  about  six  months  to  complete  and  is  budgeted  at 
US$250,000. The sections of this program are not totally season dependent; much of the work can be 
done in the winter as easily as in the summer.
Phase II recommendations are contingent upon the successful completion of the Phase I work and are 
budgeted at US$4,650,000. Exact targets for the recommended 8,000 m and 2,500 m drilling programs 
will be determined at the successful conclusion of the Phase I program.
Opinion of Merit
In the opinions of the authors of the Barsele Technical Report, the character of the Barsele Project is of 
sufficient merit to justify the recommended Phase I program.
Gunnarn JV Agreement
The  following  is  a  summary  description  of  certain  material  provisions  of  the  Gunnarn  JV 
Agreement, is not comprehensive and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 
Gunnarn JV Agreement, which is available under Orex's profile at www.sedar.com and will be 
available  under  Barsele's  profile  at  www.sedar.com  following  completion  of  the  Arrangement. 
Capitalized  terms  used  but  not  otherwise  defined  herein  have  the  meanings  set  out  in  the 
Gunnarn JV Agreement.
F-10
As part of the Spinco Reorganization, immediately prior to the Effective Time, Orex will assign all of 
its right, title and interest in and to, and all of Orex's benefits and obligations under, the Gunnarn JV 
Agreement to Barsele. Orex expects that, on the Effective Date, it will be released from substantially 
all  of  its  obligations  under  the  Gunnarn  JV  Agreement  on  the  assignment  of  the  Gunnarn  JV 
Agreement  to  Barsele,  other  than  liabilities  arising  in  respect  of  conduct  that  occurred  prior  to  the 
assignment,  and  its  obligations  to  provide  its  proportionate  share  of  funds  to  Gunnarn  to  satisfy 
environmental and other obligations of Gunnarn that arose out of activities conducted prior to such 
assignment  (the  "Excluded  Obligations").  Accordingly,  all  references  to  Orex's  benefits  and 
obligations other than the Excluded Obligations under the Gunnarn JV Agreement should be read as 
references to Barsele's benefits and obligations from and after the Effective Date.
Gunnarn Board and Management Committee
AE Sweden has a majority of the seats on the  Gunnarn Board. As of the date hereof, the Gunnarn 
Board is comprised of three directors, two of whom have been designated by AE Sweden and one of 
whom has been designated by Orex. All matters or questions requiring action, approval or decision 
by the Gunnarn Board are to be determined by a majority vote of the directors voting on the matter, 
with each director entitled to one vote.
AE  Sweden  and  Orex  have  established  a  Management  Committee  to  determine  overall  policies, 
objectives, procedures, methods, actions and other matters relating to the Barsele Project, the Barsele 
Operations and Gunnarn during the term of the Gunnarn JV Agreement.  The Gunnarn Board has 
delegated  to  the  Management  Committee,  to the full  extent permitted by applicable Law, all of  its 
authority  in  respect  of  Gunnarn,  the  Barsele  Project  and  the  Barsele  Operations.  In  addition,  the 
Gunnarn  Board  is  required  at  each  meeting  to  duly  consider  and  vote  on  the  ratification  of  all 
decisions made by the Management Committee during the period following the previous Gunnarn 
Board meeting. As of the date hereof, the Management Committee consists of two members, with AE 
Sweden  and  Orex  each  designating  one  member.  Except  for  those  matters  requiring  unanimous 
approval  described  below,  all  matters  coming  before  the  Management  Committee  require  for 
approval the affirmative vote of the members present at the meeting representing a simple majority 
of  votes.  The  number  of  votes  held  by  AE  Sweden  and  Orex's  members  of  the  Management 
Committee are 55 and 45, respectively. Practically speaking, this means that AE Sweden has control 
over  all  matters  relating  to  the  Barsele  Project,  the  Barsele  Operations  and  Gunnarn  except  for  the 
following, which matters are subject to the unanimous approval of the Management Committee:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)

(w)
undertaking all other activities reasonably necessary to fulfil the foregoing.
Exploration Period
AE Sweden must incur an aggregate of US$7,000,000 in Exploration Expenditures (the "Exploration 
Commitment")  on  or  before  July  11,  2018  (subject  to  extension  pursuant  to  Section  19.1  of  the 
Gunnarn JV Agreement in the event of a Force Majeure) (the "Exploration Period") by: (i) funding 
directly  Exploration  Expenditures  undertaken  by  AE  Sweden,  as  Operator,  and  contributing  such 
work as capital to Gunnarn; (ii) contributing as capital to Gunnarn funds in respect of Exploration 
Expenditures to be undertaken by the Operator on behalf of Gunnarn; (iii) contributing as capital to 
Gunnarn cash amounts;  or (iv) any combination of (i), (ii) and (iii). No additional Gunnarn Shares 
will be issued, nor will Gunnarn incur any debt unless such debt  is forgiven before the end of the 
year in which such debt is incurred, in connection with any capital contribution made in connection 
with the Exploration Expenditures.
If  AE  Sweden  fails  or  elects  not  to  satisfy  the  Exploration  Commitment  prior  to  the  end  of  the 
Exploration Period, AE Sweden must, upon written notice by Orex, pay to Orex within five Business 
Days of the later of: (i) the day of AE Sweden's receipt of such written notice from Orex; and (ii) the 
day  that  all  disputes,  if  any,  related  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  Exploration  Commitment  have  been 
resolved  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  Gunnarn  JV  Agreement,  an  amount  equal  to  the 
difference between US$7,000,000 and the aggregate Exploration Expenditures made by or on behalf 
of AE Sweden under the Gunnarn JV Agreement prior to the receipt by AE Sweden of such written 
notice from Orex. Such payment will be Orex's and Gunnarn's sole and exclusive remedy for a failure 
to satisfy the Exploration Commitment.
F-15
Contribution of Pre-Feasibility Study
If AE Sweden or Agnico Eagle prepares a Pre-Feasibility Study on the Barsele Project and contributes 
it as capital to Gunnarn, AE Sweden's interest in Gunnarn will increase to 70% and Orex's interest in 
Gunnarn will be reduced to 30%. All costs and expenses related to preparation of the Pre-Feasibility 
Study  will  be  for  the  account  of  AE  Sweden  or  Agnico  Eagle,  as  the  case  may  be,  and  for  greater 
certainty, such costs and expenses will not be included in Exploration Expenditures.
Joint Funding
Until the date the Pre-Feasibility Study is contributed to Gunnarn (the "PFS Completion Date"), all 
costs and expenses of Gunnarn will be for the account of AE Sweden. Following the PFS Completion 
Date, all costs and expenses of Gunnarn will be shared by AE Sweden and Orex in accordance with 
their proportionate interests in Gunnarn. From and after the PFS Completion Date and until the time 
the Gunnarn JV Agreement is terminated (the "Joint Funding Period"), each of Orex and AE Sweden 
will be required to fund its respective Proportionate Share of all Joint Funded Expenditures required 
under each Approved Work Program and Budget and any amounts payable pursuant to Sections 8.4, 
8.5 and 8.6 of the Gunnarn JV Agreement.
During the Joint Funding Period, the Operator will give each of Orex and AE Sweden at least 30 days' 
notice of any requirement that such shareholder contribute funds as a capital contribution to fund its 
Proportionate Share of all expenditures expected to be incurred (as well as required under Sections 
8.4,  8.5  and  8.6  of  the  Gunnarn  JV  Agreement)  during  a  period  not  to  exceed  three  months  (such 
notice, a "Contribution Notice").  Each Contribution Notice will include: (i) the amount of funds that 
each shareholder is required to contribute; and (ii) the date by which each such contribution must be 
paid  (the  "Contribution  Date").  If  Orex  or  AE  Sweden  (the  "Non-Funding  Shareholder")  fails  to 
provide such required funding by the Contribution Date (such failure to provide funds, a "Funding 
Default"),  the  other  shareholder  (the  "Funding  Shareholder")  will  have  the  right  (but  not  the 
obligation)  to  fund  all  or  a  portion  of  the  amount  not  funded  by  the  Non-Funding  Shareholder 
(a "Make-Up Payment") during the 10 days following the Contribution Date.  In the event that the 
Make-Up Payment, if any, is less than the full amount to have been contributed by the Non-Funding 
Shareholder, the Operator will have the right, in its discretion, to cancel or rescind all or any part of 
the applicable Approved Work Program and Budget or to revise the Approved Work Program and 
Budget to a level, scope and size commensurate with the amount of funds contributed, and likely to 
be contributed in the future, by Orex and AE Sweden.
If,  during  the  Joint  Funding  Period,  Orex  or  AE  Sweden  fails  to  contribute  to  Gunnarn  its 
Proportionate  Share  of  the  funding  required,  and  regardless  of  whether  the  Funding  Shareholder 
chooses to make a Make-Up Payment, then the Proportionate Share of the Non-Funding Shareholder 
will be diluted as provided in Section 11.2 of the Gunnarn JV Agreement.
If, at any time during the Joint Funding Period, Orex or AE Sweden's ownership of Gunnarn Shares 
falls  to  10%  or  less  of  the  issued  and  outstanding  Gunnarn  Shares,  such  shareholder  must,  upon 
receiving  notice  to  that  effect  from  the  other  shareholder,  sell,  and  the  other  shareholder  must 
purchase, all, but not less than all, of such small shareholder's Gunnarn Shares at a price equal to Fair 
Market Value of such Gunnarn Shares.
Call Rights
If Orex undergoes a Change of Control without the prior written consent of AE Sweden, AE Sweden 
will have the right to require Orex to transfer all (but not less than all) of the Gunnarn Shares held by
F-16
Orex to AE Sweden, free of any Encumbrances, at a purchase price equal to the Fair Market Value of 
the Gunnarn Shares held by Orex
If:  (i)  Orex  or  AE  Sweden  commits  a  material  breach  of  its  obligations  as  a  shareholder  under  the 
Gunnarn JV Agreement (other than a Funding Default); or (ii) the Gunnarn Board nominee of Orex or 
AE Sweden casts his or her vote on a matter in a manner that is contrary to (A) the agreement of the 
parties  in  the  Gunnarn  JV  Agreement,  or  (B)  a  determination  of  the  Management  Committee,  in 
either case, that results in a material breach of the shareholder's obligations under the Gunnarn JV 
Agreement (in each such case, such shareholder is referred to as the "Breaching Shareholder") and 
fails to remedy such material breach (if such material breach is capable of being remedied) within 20 
days of receiving notice thereof from the other shareholder (the "Non-Breaching Shareholder"), the 
Non-Breaching Shareholder will  have the right to require the Breaching Shareholder to transfer all 
(but not less than all) of the Gunnarn Shares held by the Breaching Shareholder to the Non-Breaching 
Shareholder, free of any Encumbrances, at a purchase price equal to 50% of the Fair Market Value of 
the Shares held by Breaching Shareholder.
If  Orex  or  AE  Sweden:  (i)  has  a  receiver,  receiver-manager,  interim  receiver,  monitor,  liquidator, 
assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestator or other similar agent for it or for any substantial part of its 
assets or property; or (ii) is the subject of any bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding, whether or 
not  subject  to  the  supervision  of  a  court  or  other  authority  (in  each  such  case,  such  shareholder  is 
referred to as the "Insolvent Shareholder"), the other shareholder will have the right to require the 
Insolvent  Shareholder  to  transfer  all  (but  not  less  than  all)  of  the  Gunnarn  Shares  held  by  the 
Insolvent Shareholder to the other shareholder, free of any Encumbrances, at a purchase price equal 
to the Fair Market Value of the Gunnarn Shares held by the Insolvent Shareholder.
Right of First Refusal, Tag-Along Right and Drag-Along Right
Each of Orex and AE Sweden is permitted to sell all, but not less than all, of its Gunnarn Shares to a 
Third Party Purchaser, subject to a right of first refusal in favour of the other shareholder, as more 
particularly set out in Section 13.4 of the Gunnarn JV Agreement. If AE Sweden wishes to sell all, but 
not less than all, of its Gunnarn Shares to a Third Party Purchaser and Orex does not exercise its right 
of first refusal in accordance with Section 13.4 of the Gunnarn JV Agreement, then: (i) Orex will have 
the right to require the Third Party Purchaser to purchase all of Orex's Gunnarn Shares on the same 
terms and conditions as the sale by AE Sweden to the Third Party Purchaser, as more particularly set 
out in Section 13.5 of the Gunnarn JV Agreement; and (ii) AE Sweden will have the right to require 
Orex to sell all, but not less than all, of Orex's Gunnarn Shares to the Third Party Purchaser on the 
same  terms  and  conditions  as  the  sale  by  AE  Sweden  to  the  Third  Party  Purchaser,  as  more 
particularly set out in Section 13.6 of the Gunnarn JV Agreement.

DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES DISTRIBUTED
Barsele's  authorized  share  capital  consists  of  an  unlimited  number  of  common  shares  without  par 
value, being the Spinco Shares. Assuming completion of the Arrangement and pursuant to its terms, 
approximately  101,890,199  Spinco  Shares  will  be  issued  and  outstanding  as  fully  paid  and  non-
assessable on completion of the Arrangement, of which approximately 101,890,199 Spinco Shares or 
100%  will  be  distributed  to  Former  Orex  Shareholders.    The  calculation  in  this  Appendix  F  of  the 
approximate  aggregate  number  of  Spinco  Shares  to  be  distributed  pursuant  to  the  Arrangement 
assumes that: (a) there are no Dissent Shares; (b) no outstanding Orex Warrants have been exercised; 
and  (c)  no  outstanding  Orex  Options  have  been  exercised.  For  further  details  with  respect  to  the 
distribution of the Spinco Shares on completion of the Arrangement, see in the Circular, "The Meeting 
–  The  Arrangement"  —  and  in  particular:  "The  Meeting  –  The  Arrangement  -  Principal  Steps  of  the 
Arrangement", " The Meeting – The Arrangement - Procedure for Exchange of Orex Shares", " The Meeting – 
The Arrangement - Orex Option Plan and Treatment of Orex Options", "Summary - Treatment of Warrants", 
"The  Meeting  –  The  Arrangement  -  Cancellation  of  Rights  After  Six  Years"  and  "  The  Meeting  –  The 
Arrangement - Risks Associated with the Arrangement".
Common Shares
The authorized share structure of Barsele consists of an unlimited number of Spinco Shares, of which 
one Spinco Share is issued and outstanding as at the date of the Circular.
All of the Spinco Shares are of the same class and, once issued, rank equally as to dividends, voting 
powers and participation in assets and in all other respects, on liquidation, dissolution or winding up 
of Barsele, whether voluntary or involuntary, or any other distribution of the assets of Barsele among 
its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs after Barsele has paid out its liabilities. The 
issued Spinco Shares are not subject to call or assessment by Barsele nor are there any pre-emptive, 
conversion, exchange, redemption or retraction rights attaching to the Spinco Shares.
All registered Spinco Shareholders are entitled to receive a notice of any general or special meeting to 
be  convened  by  Barsele.  At  any  general  or  special  meeting,  subject  to  the  restrictions  on  joint 
registered owners of Spinco Shares, on a show of hands every Spinco Shareholder who is present in
F-19
person and entitled to vote has one vote and on a poll, every  Spinco Shareholder has one vote for 
each Spinco Share of which it is the registered owner and may exercise such vote either in person or 
by proxy. Barsele's articles provide that the rights and provisions attached to any class of shares, in 
which shares are issued, may not be modified, amended or varied unless consented to by ordinary 
resolution passed by a simple majority of the votes cast in person or by proxy by holders of shares of 
that class.
Approximately 101,890,199 Spinco Shares are expected to be issued to Orex immediately prior to the 
Effective Time pursuant to the Spinco Reorganization. Pursuant to the Arrangement, all outstanding 
Orex Shares as at the Effective Date will be exchanged for, among other things, Spinco Shares. As of 
the date hereof, it is expected that, based on the number of issued and outstanding Orex Shares as of 
the  Record  Date,  approximately  101,890,199  Spinco  Shares  will  be  issued  and  outstanding, 
representing approximately 100% of the Spinco Shares issued upon completion of the Arrangement. 
See in the Circular "The Meeting – The Arrangement – Principal Steps of the Arrangement".
Spinco Options
Subject  to  the  receipt  of  Orex  Securityholder  Approval,  the  only  equity  compensation  plan  Spinco 
will have is the Spinco Option Plan. The Spinco Option Plan will be established to provide incentive 
to  employees,  directors,  senior  officers,  management  companies,  and  consultants  who  provide 
services to Barsele. TSX-V policy requires that all companies listed on the TSX-V adopt a stock option 
plan if they wish to grant options, and that all stock option plans that reserve a maximum of 10% of 
the  issued  and  outstanding  share  capital  of  the  issuer  at  the  time  of  grant  must  be  approved  and 
ratified by shareholders on an annual basis. See "The Meeting – The Arrangement – Principal Steps of the 
Arrangement" for information on how Spinco Options will be issued.
Under  the  Spinco  Option  Plan,  the  total  number  of  Spinco  Shares  allotted  and  reserved  for  future 
issuance will not exceed 10% of the issued and outstanding share capital of Barsele from time to time.
As of the date of the Circular, Barsele has not granted any incentive stock options under the Spinco 
Option Plan, or otherwise, nor has it issued any other rights or securities to purchase Spinco Shares.
Spinco Warrants
In connection with the Arrangement, all Orex Warrants outstanding immediately before the Effective 
Time  which  have  not  been  duly  exercised  will  be  exchanged  for  New  Orex  Warrants  and  Spinco 
Warrants. Each Spinco Warrant will entitle the holder thereof to purchase from Barsele one Spinco 
Share at a purchase price per Spinco Share equal to the exercise price of the Orex Warrant before the 
Effective  Time  for  which  such  Spinco  Warrant  was  exchanged.  The  expiry  date  of  each  Spinco 
Warrant  will  be  equivalent  to  the  respective  expiry  date  of  such  Orex  Warrant  so  exchanged.  All 
other terms and conditions of the Spinco Warrant will be as set out in the form of Spinco Warrant 
Certificate attached as Schedule D of the Arrangement Agreement, which can be found under Orex's 
SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com.
Barsele expects that 14,643,680 Spinco Warrants will be issued under the Arrangement in respect of 
the 14,643,680 Orex Warrants outstanding as at the Record Date.
Listing of Spinco Shares
Spinco has applied to the TSX-V for the listing of the Spinco Shares on the TSX-V. Any listing will be 
subject to Barsele fulfilling all the requirements of the TSX-V. There can be no assurances as to if, or 
when, the Spinco Shares will be listed or traded on the TSX-V, or any other stock exchange.
F-20
As  at  the  date  of  the  Circular,  there  is  no  market  through  which  the  Spinco  Shares  to  be 
distributed pursuant to the Arrangement may be sold and Orex Shareholders may not be able to 
resell the Spinco Shares to be distributed to them pursuant to the Arrangement. This may affect 
the  pricing  of  the  Spinco  Shares  in  the  secondary  market,  the  transparency  and  availability  of 
trading prices, the liquidity of the Spinco Shares, and the extent of issuer regulation.
As  at  the  date  of  the  Circular,  Barsele  does  not  have  any  of  its  securities  listed  or  quoted,  has  not 
applied to list or quote any of its securities, and does not intend to apply to list or quote any of its 
securities on the Toronto Stock Exchange, a U.S. marketplace, or a marketplace outside Canada and 
the United States of America.
See in this Appendix F, "Risks Associated with Barsele".

Barsele or any of its Subsidiaries at the time a Spinco Option is granted; or a company that is wholly-
owned by any of the foregoing. Such persons and entities are referred to herein as "Eligible Persons".
Board Discretion: The Spinco Option Plan will provide that, generally, the number of Spinco Shares 
subject  to  each  Spinco  Option,  the  exercise  price,  the  expiry  time,  the  extent  to  which  such  Spinco

No Assignment: The Spinco Options may not be assigned or transferred.
Termination Before Expiry: Generally, Spinco Options must expire and terminate on a date stipulated 
by the board of directors of Barsele at the time of grant. If the employment of an optionholder who is 
an  Eligible  Person  is  terminated  without  cause,  such  option  holder's  Spinco  Options  (vested  or 
unvested)  will  terminate  90  days  following  notice  of  termination  or  on  the  expiry  of  such  Spinco 
Options,  whichever  is  earlier.  If  the  employment  of  an  optionholder  who  is  an  Eligible  Person  is

months following the date of such option holder ceasing to be an Eligible Person or on the expiry of 
such  vested  Spinco  Options,  whichever  is  earlier.    Upon  any  attempt  to  transfer,  assign,  pledge,
F-22
hypothecate  or  otherwise  dispose  of  a  Spinco  Option,  such  Spinco  Option  will,  at  the  election  of 
Barsele, cease and terminate.
Exercise Price: Subject to any adjustments made pursuant to the Spinco Option Plan and excluding 
the Spinco Options exchanged for Orex Options outstanding as of the Effective Time pursuant to the 
Arrangement, Spinco Options granted under the terms of the Spinco Option Plan will be exercisable 
at a price that is not less than the market price of the Spinco Shares on the TSX-V.
Full  Payment  for  Shares:  Barsele  will  only  issue  Spinco  Shares  pursuant  to  the  exercise  of  Spinco 
Options granted under the Spinco Option Plan once the exercise price for those Spinco Shares have

more  of  the  following  actions:  (a)  accelerate  the  vesting  of  any  Spinco  Options  and  any  Spinco 
Options that are not exercised or surrendered by the effective time of the Change of Control Event 
will  be  deemed  to  have  expired;  (b)  offer  to  acquire  from  each  option  holder  his  or  her  Spinco 
Options for a cash payment equal to the In the Money Amount (as defined in the Spinco Option Plan 
in  Appendix  H)  and  any  Spinco  Options  that  are  not  so  surrendered  by  the  effective  time  of  the 
Change of Control Event will be deemed to have expired; and (c) that a Spinco Option granted under 
the  Spinco  Option  Plan  be  exchanged  for  an  option  to  acquire,  for  the  same  exercise  price,  that 
number and type of  securities as  would be distributed to a Spinco  Option holder in respect of the 
Spinco  Shares  issued  to  such  option  holder  had  he  or  she  exercised  the  Spinco  Option  before  the 
Effective Time of the Change of Control Event, provided that any such replacement option will have 
to provide that it survives for a period of not less than one year from the effective time of the Change 
of Control Event, regardless of the continuing directorship, officership or employment of the option 
holder.
Termination  of Plan: The Spinco  Option Plan will terminate when it is terminated by Barsele. Any

To  the  knowledge  of  Barsele,  no  proposed  director  is,  as  at  the  date  of  the  Circular,  or  has  been, 
within 10 years before the date of the Circular, a director, CEO or CFO of any company (including 
Barsele) that:
(a)
(b)
was the subject, while the proposed director was acting in the capacity as director, CEO or 
CFO of such company, of a cease trade or similar order or an order that denied the relevant 
company access to any exemption under securities legislation, that was in effect for a period 
of more than 30 consecutive days; or
was subject to a cease trade or similar order or an order that denied the relevant company 
access to any exemption under securities legislation, that was in effect for a period of more 
than 30 consecutive days, that was issued after the proposed director ceased to be a director, 
CEO or CFO but which resulted from an event that occurred while the proposed director was 
acting in the capacity as director, CEO or CFO of such company, except as follows:
(i)
(ii)
On June 10, 2003, while Mr. Wilmot was a director and officer of CTF Technologies 
Inc. ("CTF"), CTF was subject to a cease trade order in British Columbia for failure to 
file  its  financial  statements  for  the  year ended  December  31,  2002, and  for  the  first 
quarter  ended  March  31,  2003,  due  to  the  CTF's  determination  in  late  2002  that  an 
accounting  change  to  the  manner  in  which  it  accounted  for  some  of  its  revenues 
would be appropriate. The financial statements were filed and the cease trade order 
was revoked on April 4, 2008.
On  September  7,  2007,  while  Mr.  Wilmot  was  a  director  of  Biotech  Holdings  Ltd. 
("Biotech"),  a  company  listed  on  the  TSX-V,  the  TSX-V  notified  Biotech  that  it  had 
initiated a review of its filings. Following review by the TSX-V in respect of certain 
compliance  matters  and  direct  discussions  with  the  TSX-V,  Biotech's  management 
decided to apply to delist the shares of Biotech from the TSX-V. Subsequently, Mr. 
Wilmot resigned as a director of Biotech on October 15, 2007.
To the knowledge of management of Barsele, there has been no director or officer, or any shareholder 
holding a sufficient number of securities of Barsele to affect materially the control of Barsele that is, as 
at the Record Date, or has been within the 10 years before the Record Date, a director or executive 
officer  of  any  company  (including  Barsele)  that,  while  that  person  was  acting  in  that  capacity,  or 
within a year of that person ceasing to act in that capacity, became bankrupt, made a proposal under
F-26
any legislation relating to bankruptcy or insolvency or was subject to or instituted any proceedings, 
arrangement or compromise with creditors or had a receiver, receiver manager or trustee appointed 
to hold its assets.
Personal Bankruptcies
To the knowledge of management of Barsele, there has been no director or officer, or any shareholder 
holding  a  sufficient  number  of  securities  of  Barsele  to  affect  materially  the  control  of  Barsele,  or  a 
personal holding company of any such person that has, within the 10 years before the Record Date, 
become  bankrupt,  made  a  proposal  under  any  legislation  relating  to  bankruptcy  or  insolvency,  or 
was  subject  to  or  instituted  any  proceedings,  arrangement  or  compromise  with  creditors,  or  had  a 
receiver,  receiver  manager  or  trustee  appointed  to  hold  the  assets  of  the  director,  officer  or 
shareholder.
Penalties or Sanctions
To  the  knowledge  of  management  of  Barsele,  no  director  or  officer,  or  any  shareholder  holding  a

any  penalties  or  sanctions  imposed  by  a  court  relating  to  Canadian  securities  legislation  or  by  a 
Canadian securities regulatory authority or has entered into a settlement agreement with a Canadian 
securities regulatory authority; or been subject to any other penalties or sanctions imposed by a court 
or regulatory body that would likely be considered important to a reasonable investor in making an 
investment decision.
Conflicts of Interest
There are potential conflicts of interest to which the directors and officers of Barsele will be subject in 
connection with the operations of Barsele. In particular, certain of the directors and officers of Barsele 
are  involved  in  managerial  or  director  positions  with  other  mineral  exploration  and  investment 
companies whose operations may, from time to time, be in direct competition with those of Barsele or 
with  entities  which  may,  from  time  to  time,  provide  financing  to,  or  make  equity  investments  in, 
competitors  of  Barsele.  Conflicts,  if  any,  will  be  subject  to  the  procedures  and  remedies  available 
under the Business Corporations Act. The Business Corporations Act provides that if a director has a 
material  interest  in  a  contract  or  proposed  contract  or  agreement  that  is  material  to  Barsele,  the 
director will disclose his interest in such contract or agreement and will refrain from voting on any 
matter  in  respect  of  such  contract  or  agreement,  subject  to  and  in  accordance  with,  the  Business 
Corporations Act.
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Compensation Philosophy 
Barsele's overall compensation philosophy  will be to  provide a compensation package  that enables 
Barsele to attract, retain and motivate  named executive officers to achieve its  short-term and  long-
term business goals. Consistent with this philosophy, the following goals provide a framework for 
Barsele's named executive officers compensation program:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
pay competitively to attract, retain, and motivate named executive officers;
relate total compensation for each named executive officer to overall company performance;
F-27
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
aggregate the elements of total compensation to reflect competitive market requirements and 
to address strategic business needs;
expose a portion of each named executive officer's compensation to risk, the degree of which 
will  positively  correlate  to  the  level  of  the  named  executive  officer's  responsibility  and 
performance; and
align the interests of Barsele's named executive officers with those of Spinco Shareholders.
Oversight of Executive Compensation Program 
The Barsele Board will be responsible for establishing a compensation policy and administering the 
compensation programs of our executive officers.  The amount of compensation proposed to be paid 
by  Barsele  to  each  of  its  directors  and  named  executive  officers  and  the  terms  of  those  Persons' 
employment is determined solely by the Barsele Board.
Executive Compensation Program Overview 
The executive compensation package proposed for Barsele's named executive officers is comprised of:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
base salary or fees; and
equity based compensation in the form of Spinco Options.
Base Salary
Immediately after completion of the Arrangement, Barsele will pay the consulting companies of each 
of Messrs. Cope and Wilmot, the two named executive officers, monthly compensation of $1,000 plus 
applicable GST. The other executive officers of Barsele will only receive compensation from Orex.
If and when Barsele secures additional financing to pursue its business objectives, the base salaries of 
the executive officers will be examined and revised to reflect the time each executive officer devotes 
to the affairs of Barsele, based on the following base salary compensation strategy:
(cid:120)  The base salary proposed to be paid to Barsele's executive officers will be commensurate with 
the  nature  of  Barsele's  business  and  the  individual's  experience,  duties  and  scope  of 
responsibilities.  Barsele  will  seek  to  pay  competitive  base  salaries  required  to  recruit  and 
retain executives of the quality that it must employ to ensure success.
(cid:120)
In making determinations of salary levels for Barsele's executive officers, the Barsele Board is 
likely to consider the entire compensation package for executive officers, including the equity 
compensation provided under the Spinco Option Plan.  Barsele intends for salary levels to be 
consistent with competitive practices of comparable institutions and each executive's level of 
responsibility.  The  Barsele  Board  is  likely  to  determine,  through  discussion  only,  with  no 
formal  objectives  (performance  or  otherwise)  or  criteria,  the  level  of  any  salary  (or  salary 
increase)  after  reviewing  the  qualifications,  experience,  and  performance  of  the  particular 
executive  officer  and  the  nature  of  Barsele's  business,  the  complexity  of  its  activities,  the 
importance of the executive's contribution to the success of the business and the amount of 
time the executive will dedicate to Barsele.
(cid:120)  The Barsele Board may also take into consideration salaries paid to others in similar positions 
in Barsele's industry based on the experience of the directors and review of publicly available
F-28
information. The discussion of the information and factors considered and given weight by 
the Barsele Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but it is believed to include all material 
factors  considered  by  the  Barsele  Board.  In  reaching  the  determination  to  approve  and 
recommend  the  base  salaries  of  Barsele's  executive  officers  following  completion  of  the 
Arrangement, the Barsele Board will not assign any relative or specific weight to the factors 
which  are  considered,  and  the  members  may  give  a  different  weight  to  each  factor.  The 
Barsele  Board  will  review  and  adjust  the  base  salaries  of  Barsele's  executive  officers  when 
deemed appropriate.
Option-based Awards
Executive officers of Barsele, as well as directors, employees and consultants (together referred to in 
this section as "optionees"), are eligible to participate in the Spinco Option Plan. Stock option grants 
are  an  important  part  of  Barsele's  incentive  strategy,  permitting  executive  officers  to  share  in  any 
appreciation  of  the  market  value  of  Spinco  Shares  over  a  stated  period  of  time  reinforcing 
commitment  to  long-term  growth  and  shareholder  value.  Stock  options  reward  overall  corporate 
performance,  as  measured  through  the  price  of  Spinco  Shares,  and  enable  executive  officers  to 
acquire and maintain a significant ownership position in Barsele.
Management will recommend the grant of individual stock options to the Barsele Board and the size 
of  the  grants  will  be  dependent  on,  among  other  things,  each  optionee's  level  of  responsibility, 
authority and importance to Barsele and the degree to which such long-term contribution to Barsele 
will  be  responsible  for  its  long-term  success.  The  Barsele  Board  will  also  evaluate  the  number  of 
options  an  optionee  has  been  previously  granted,  the  exercise  price  of  the  options  and  the  term 
remaining on those options when considering further grants.
Options will typically be priced at the closing trading price of the Spinco Shares on the last trading 
day  immediately  preceding  the  date  of  grant  and  the  proposed  policy  of  the  Barsele  Board  is  that 
options will expire five years from the date of grant and vest immediately.
Barsele will grant Spinco Options to an executive officer when they first join Barsele, based on their 
level  of  responsibility.  Additional  grants  may  be  made  periodically  to  ensure  that  the  number  of 
options  granted  to  any  particular  officer  is  commensurate  with  the  officer's  ongoing  level  of 
responsibility within Barsele.
Benefits and Perquisites
Barsele's executive officers will not receive perquisites or benefits that are not generally available to 
all employees or consultants of Barsele.

Director Compensation
Since its incorporation, Barsele has not paid its directors a fee for acting as such, nor has it granted to 
its directors any option or share-based awards.  Directors are entitled to be reimbursed for reasonable 
expenditures incurred in performing their duties as  directors, and Barsele  may, from time to time, 
grant to its directors Spinco Options (see "Options and Other Rights to Purchase Securities of Barsele").
INDEBTEDNESS OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

financial year was a director, executive officer or senior officer of Barsele, and no associate of any of 
the foregoing persons has been indebted to Barsele at any time since the commencement of Barsele's 
last  completed  financial  year.  No  guarantee,  support  agreement,  letter  of  credit  or  other  similar 
arrangement or understanding has been provided by Barsele at any time since the beginning of the 
most recently completed financial year with respect to any indebtedness of any such person, other 
than amounts not exceeding $30,000 for travel advances.

disclose  in  the  Circular  certain  information  regarding  the  Audit  Committee.  That  information  is 
disclosed below.
The Audit Committee's Charter
The  Barsele  Board  has  adopted  a  charter  for  its  Audit  Committee  which  sets  out  the  Audit

President and Chief Executive Officer of Barsele.

Reliance on Exemptions
At no time since the commencement of Barsele's most recently completed financial year has Barsele 
relied on the exemption in Section 2.4 (De Minimis Non-audit Services) of NI 52-110 or an exemption 
from NI 52-110, in whole or in part, granted by a securities regulator under Part 8 (Exemptions) of NI 
52-110.
Reliance on Certain Other Exemptions
Since  Barsele  will  be  a  "venture  issuer",  as  defined  in  NI  52-110,  it  will  rely  on  the  exemption 
contained  in  Section  6.1  of  NI  52-110  from  the  requirements  of  Part  3  Composition  of  the  Audit 
Committee (which requires all members of the Audit Committee to be independent subject to limited 
exceptions) Part 5 Reporting Obligations of NI 52-110 (which requires certain prescribed disclosure 
about the Audit Committee in the Circular).
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
National  Policy  58-101  -  Disclosure  of  Corporate  Governance  Practices  requires  Barsele  to  annually 
disclose  certain  information  regarding  its  corporate  governance  practices,  which  information  is 
disclosed below.
Board of Directors
The Barsele Board, at present, is composed of five directors, two of whom are executive officers of 
Barsele and three of whom are considered to be "independent," as that term is defined in applicable 
securities  legislation.  Messrs.  Arthur  Freeze,  Rick  Sayers,  and  William  White  are  considered  to  be 
independent directors. Mr. Gary Cope, President and CEO of Barsele, and Mr. Ross Wilmot, CFO of 
Barsele,  by  reason  of  their  respective  offices,  are  not.  In  determining  whether  a  director  is 
independent, the Barsele Board chiefly considers whether the director has a relationship which could, 
or could be perceived to, interfere with the director's ability to objectively assess the performance of 
management.
The Barsele Board is responsible for approving long-term strategic plans and annual operating plans 
and  budgets  recommended  by  management.  Barsele  Board  consideration  and  approval  is  also 
required  for  material  contracts  and  business  transactions,  as  well  as  all  debt  and  equity  financing 
transactions.
The  Barsele  Board  delegates  to  management  the  responsibility  for  meeting  defined  corporate 
objectives,  implementing  approved  strategic  and  operating  plans,  carrying  on  Barsele's  business  in 
the ordinary course, managing Barsele's cash flow, evaluating new business opportunities, recruiting 
staff,  and  complying  with  applicable  regulatory  requirements.  The  Barsele  Board  also  looks  to
F-33
management to furnish recommendations respecting corporate objectives, long-term strategic plans, 
and annual operating plans.
The Barsele Board and management will play a diminished role with respect to the Barsele Project as 
the overall policies, objectives, procedures, methods, actions and other matters relating to the Barsele 
Project, the Barsele Operations and Gunnarn during the term of the Gunnarn JV Agreement will be 
determined by the Management Committee pursuant to the terms of the Gunnarn JV Agreement. See 
"Description  of  the  Business  -  Gunnarn  JV  Agreement"  above.  However,  the  Barsele  Board  and 
management will nevertheless remain involved in the Barsele Project through their representation on 
the Gunnarn Board and Management Committee, respectively. As of the date hereof, Arthur Freeze, a 
member of the Barsele Board, and Ben Whiting, Barsele's Vice, President, Exploration, are Barsele's 
designees on the Gunnarn Board and the Management Committee, respectively.

(or equivalent) in a jurisdiction or a foreign jurisdiction.

Orientation and Continuing Education
Barsele  has  not  yet  developed  an  official  orientation  or  training  program  for  new  directors.  As 
required, new directors will have the opportunity to become familiar with Barsele by meeting with 
the other directors and with officers and employees. Orientation and continuing education activities 
will  be  tailored  to  the  particular  needs  and  experience  of  each  director  and  the  overall  needs  of 
Barsele's Board.
Ethical Business Conduct
The  Barsele  Board  monitors  the  ethical  conduct  of  Barsele  and  ensures  that  it  complies  with 
applicable legal and regulatory requirements, such as those of relevant securities commissions and 
stock exchanges. The Barsele Board has found that the fiduciary duties placed on individual directors 
by Barsele's governing corporate legislation and the common law, as well as the restrictions placed by 
applicable corporate legislation on the individual director's participation in decisions of the Barsele 
Board  in  which  the  director  has  an  interest,  have  been  sufficient  to  ensure  that  the  Barsele  Board 
operates independently of management and in the best interests of Barsele.
Nomination of Directors
The Barsele Board has not appointed a nominating committee because the Barsele Board fulfills these 
functions.  The  Barsele  Board  periodically  reviews  suggestions  from  existing  directors  regarding 
potential changes to the Barsele Board.
F-34
Compensation
All  compensation  matters  are  dealt  with  by  the  Barsele  Board,  based  on  recommendations  by  the 
Compensation Committee.
To  determine  compensation  payable,  the  Compensation  Committee  reviews  compensation  paid  to 
directors, CEOs, and CFOs of companies of similar size and stage of development. The Compensation 
Committee  determines  an  appropriate  compensation  package  that  reflects  the  need  to  provide 
incentive  and  compensation  for  the  time  and  effort  expended  by  the  directors  and  senior 
management,  while  taking  into  account  the  financial  and  other  resources  of  Barsele.  In  setting  the 
compensation, the independent directors annually review the performance of the CEO and CFO in 
light of Barsele's objectives and consider other factors that may have impacted the success of Barsele 
in achieving its objectives.
None  of  the  Compensation  Committee  members  has  specific  direct  experience  relevant  to  his 
responsibilities  in executive compensation, except Gary Cope's extensive history as an executive in 
the  junior  mining  industry,  Rick  Sayers'  accounting  and  management  background,  and  William 
White's graduate business school background and management experience.

A  description  of  the  function  of  the  Audit  Committee  can  be  found  in  this  Appendix  F  under  the 
heading "Audit Committee".
The  purpose  of  the  Corporate  Governance  Committee  is  to  assist  the  Barsele  Board  in  fulfilling  its 
oversight responsibilities with respect to corporate governance in general, and specifically to ensure 
that  the  requirements  for  the  Barsele  Board  and  its  activities  conform  to  Barsele's  corporate 
governance  policy,  the  requirements  of  the  Business  Corporation  Act  and  all  relevant  regulatory 
bodies.
Assessments
The Barsele Board has not adopted formal procedures for assessing the effectiveness of the Barsele 
Board,  its  committees,  or  its  individual  directors.  The  relatively  small  size  of  Barsele  enables  the 
Barsele Board to satisfy itself that individual directors are performing effectively. As Barsele grows, 
the  Barsele  Board  will  consider  adopting  formal  procedures  for  evaluating  director  and  committee 
performance.
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH BARSELE
An investment in Spinco Shares, as well as Barsele's prospects, is highly speculative due to the high-
risk nature of its business and the present stage of its development. Shareholders of Barsele may lose 
their entire investment. The risks described below are not the  only  ones facing Barsele. Additional
F-35
risks  not  currently  known  to  Barsele,  or  that  Barsele  currently  deems  immaterial,  may  also  impair 
Barsele's  operations.  If  any  of  the  following  risks  actually  occur,  Barsele's  business,  financial 
condition and operating results could be adversely affected.
Orex  Shareholders  should  consult  with  their  professional  advisors  to  assess  the  Arrangement  and 
their resulting investment in Barsele. In evaluating Barsele and its business and whether to vote in 
favor  of  the  Arrangement,  Orex  Shareholders  should  carefully  consider,  in  addition  to  the  other 
information contained in the Circular and this Appendix F, the risk factors which follow, as well as 
the risks associated with the Arrangement (see in the Circular "The Meeting – The Arrangement — Risks 
Associated  with  the  Arrangement").    These  risk  factors  may  not  be  a  definitive  list  of  all  risk  factors 
associated with the Arrangement, an investment in Barsele or in connection with Barsele's business 
and operations.
Joint Venture Risk
The Barsele Project is currently operated under the Gunnarn JV Agreement and other properties in 
which Barsele may acquire an interest may also be operated through joint ventures with other mining 
companies. As a result, the Barsele Project  is, and  other mining properties  of Barsele may become, 
subject  to  the  risks  normally  associated  with  the  conduct  of  joint  ventures.  Such  risks  include: 
inability  to  exert  control  over  strategic  decisions  made  in  respect  of  such  properties;  disagreement 
with  partners  on  how  to  develop  and  operate  mines  efficiently;  inability  of  partners  to  meet  their 
obligations  to  the  joint  venture  or  third  parties;  and  litigation  between  partners  regarding  joint 
venture matters. Any failure of such other companies to meet their obligations to Barsele or to third 
parties,  or  any  disputes  with  respect  to  the  parties'  respective  rights  and  obligations,  could  have  a 
material  adverse  effect  on  the  joint  ventures  or  their  respective  properties,  which  could  have  a 
material adverse effect on Barsele.
Gunnarn Dilution Risk
Pursuant  to  the  Gunnarn  JV  Agreement,  if  AE  Sweden  or  Agnico  Eagle  prepares  a  pre-feasibility 
study  on  the  Barsele  Project  and  contributes  it  to  Gunnarn,  AE  Sweden's  ownership  interest  in 
Gunnarn  will  increase  to  70%  and,  as  a  result,  Barsele's  ownership  interest  in  Gunnarn  would 
decrease to 30%. As a result, Barsele is at risk of having its ownership interest in the Barsele Project 
diluted from 45% to 30%. Additionally, if Barsele is unable to raise the financing necessary to meet its 
future obligations under the Gunnarn JV Agreement to fund the Barsele Project in proportion to its 
ownership interest in Gunnarn, it will be at risk of having its ownership interest in the Barsele Project 
further  diluted.  If  Barsele's  ownership  interest  in  Gunnarn  falls  to  10%  or  less,  Barsele  will  be 
required, upon receiving notice to that effect from the AE Sweden, to sell all, but not less than all, of 
Barsele's  Gunnarn  Shares  at  a  price  equal  to  Fair  Market  Value  (as  defined  in  the  Gunnarn  JV 
Agreement). See "Description of the Business - Gunnarn JV Agreement" above.
No Assurance of Listing of Spinco Shares
The Spinco Shares are not currently listed on any stock exchange. Although Barsele has applied for 
the  listing  of  the  Spinco  Shares  on  the  TSX-V,  there  is  no  assurance  as  to  when,  or  if,  the  Spinco 
Shares will be listed on the TSX-V or on any other stock exchange. Until the Spinco Shares are listed 
on a stock exchange, shareholders of Barsele  may not be able to  sell  their Spinco Shares. Even  if a 
listing is obtained, ownership of Spinco Shares will involve a high degree of risk.
F-36
Dividends
Barsele  currently  intends  to  retain  future  earnings  to  finance  the  operation,  development  and 
expansion of its business. Barsele does not anticipate paying cash dividends on the Spinco Shares in 
the  foreseeable  future.  Payment  of  future  cash  dividends,  if  any,  will  be  at  the  discretion  of  the 
Barsele  Board  and  will  depend  on  Barsele's  financial  condition,  results  of  operations,  contractual 
restrictions,  capital  requirements,  business  prospects  and  other  factors  that  the  Barsele  Board 
considers relevant. Accordingly, investors will only see a return on their investment if the value of 
Spinco Shares appreciates.
Exploration and Development Risks
All Barsele's operations involve exploration and development and there is no guarantee that any such 
activity  will  result  in  commercial  production  of  mineral  deposits.  Mineral  exploration  and 
development involves substantial expenses and a high degree of risk, which even a combination of 
experience,  knowledge  and  careful  evaluation  may  not  be  able  to  adequately  mitigate.  Most 
exploration  projects  do  not  result  in  the  discovery  of  commercially  mineable  deposits.  There  is  no 
certainty that the expenditures made or to be made by Barsele in the exploration and development of 
the  mineral  properties  will  result  in  the  discovery  of  gold,  silver  or  other  mineralized  materials  in 
commercial  quantities.  While  discovery  of  a  gold  deposit  may  result  in  substantial  rewards,  few 
properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. Major expenses may be 
required to establish reserves by drilling and to construct mining and processing facilities at a site. It 
is  impossible  to  ensure  that  Barsele's  current  exploration  programs  will  result  in  profitable 
commercial mining operations.
The commercial viability of a mineral deposit is also dependent upon a number of factors, some of 
which are the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure, 
metal prices which are highly cyclical and government regulations, including regulations relating to 
prices,  taxes,  royalties,  allowable  production,  land  tenure,  land  use,  importing  and  exporting  of 
minerals  and  environmental  protection.    The  exact  effect  of  these  factors  cannot  be  accurately 
predicted,  but  the  negative  combination  of  these  factors  may  result  in  Barsele  not  receiving  an 
adequate  return  on  invested  capital.  There  is  no  certainty  that  expenditures  made  by  Barsele  will 
result in discoveries of commercial quantities of ore.
Title Risks
There can be no assurance that the interest held by Barsele in mineral properties is free from defects. 
Barsele  has  investigated  its  rights  to  explore  and  exploit  the  properties  and  has  caused  a  standard 
form  of  title  opinion  to  be  obtained.    To  the  best  of  Barsele's  knowledge,  those  rights  are  in  good 
standing. However, there is no assurance that such rights will not be revoked, or significantly altered, 
to  Barsele's  detriment.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  Barsele's  rights  will  not  be  challenged  or 
impugned by third parties. The mineral property interests comprising Barsele's properties have not 
been surveyed, and as such their location and boundaries may be in doubt.
Market Price of Gold, Silver and Other Metals
Barsele's long-term viability and future profitability will depend, in large part, upon the market price 
of gold and other metals and minerals produced from its mineral properties. The market price of gold 
and other metals is volatile and is impacted by numerous factors beyond Barsele's control, including:
(cid:120) 
(cid:120)
expectations with respect to the rate of inflation; 
the relative strength of the Canadian dollar and certain other currencies;
F-37
(cid:120) 
(cid:120) 
(cid:120) 
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
interest rates; 
global or regional political or economic conditions; 
supply and demand for jewelry and industrial products containing metals; 
sales by central banks and other holders, speculators and producers of gold and other metals 
in response to any of the above factors; and 
any executive order curtailing the production or sale of gold.
The volatility of mineral prices represents a substantial risk which no amount of planning or technical 
expertise can fully eliminate. In the event gold prices decline or remain low for prolonged periods of 
time,  Barsele  may  be  unable  to  develop  its  properties,  which  may  adversely  affect  its  results  of 
operations, financial performance and cash flows.
A  decrease  in  the  market  price  of  gold  and  other  metals  could  affect  the  commercial  viability  of 
Barsele's  properties  and  its  anticipated  development  of  such  properties  in  the  future.  Lower  gold 
prices  could  also  adversely  affect  Barsele's  ability  to  finance  exploration  and  development  of  its 
properties.
Foreign Currency Fluctuations
Upon  completion  of  the  Arrangement,  Barsele  will  operate  in  more  than  one  country  and  its 
functional currency is the Canadian Dollar. Barsele's offices will be located in Canada, and its mining 
exploration  properties  will  be  located  in  Sweden.  Barsele's  financial  results  will  be  reported  in 
Canadian Dollars. Any appreciation in the currency of Sweden or other countries where Barsele may 
carry out exploration activities against the Canadian Dollar will increase Barsele's costs of carrying 
out operations in such countries. Fluctuations in and among the various currencies in which Barsele 
operates could have a material effect on Barsele's operations and financial results.
Environmental Regulation
Barsele  is  subject  to  substantial  environmental  and  other  regulatory  requirements  and  such 
regulations  are  becoming  more  stringent.    All  phases  of  development  operations  are  subject  to 
environmental  regulations.  Environmental  legislation  is  evolving  in  a  manner  which  will  require 
stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent 
environmental  assessments  of  proposed  projects  and  a  heightened  degree  of  responsibility  for 
companies and their officers, directors and employees. There is no assurance that future changes in 
environmental  regulations,  if  any,  will  not  adversely  affect  Barsele's  operations.  Environmental 
hazards may exist on the properties which are presently unknown to Barsele and which have been 
caused by previous or existing owners or operators of the properties.
Competition
The international mining industry is highly competitive. The mining industry is global and consists 
of  a  small,  decreasing  number  of  large  players.  Competition  for  new  mining  properties  by  these 
larger,  more  established  companies  may  prevent  Barsele  from  acquiring  interests  in  additional 
properties or mining operations.  Significant and increasing competition exists for mineral acquisition 
opportunities  in  Sweden.  As  a  result  of  this  competition,  some  of  which  is  with  larger,  more 
established  mining  companies  with  substantial  capabilities  and  greater  financial  and  technical 
resources than Barsele, Barsele may be unable to acquire rights to exploit additional attractive mining 
properties on terms Barsele considers acceptable.  Accordingly, there can be no assurance that Barsele 
will acquire any interest in additional operations that would yield reserves or result in commercial 
mining operations.
F-38
Management
The success of Barsele is currently largely dependent on the performance of its officers. The loss of 
the services of these persons will have a material adverse effect on Barsele's business and prospects. 
There  is  no  assurance  Barsele  can  maintain  the  services  of  its  officers  or  other  qualified  personnel 
required to operate its business.
Key Person Insurance
Barsele  does  not  maintain  key  person  insurance  on  any  of  its  directors  or  officers,  and  as  a  result 
Barsele  would  bear  the  full  loss and  expense  of  hiring  and  replacing  any  director  or  officer  in  the 
event of the loss of any such Persons by their resignation, retirement, incapacity, or death, as well as 
any loss of business opportunity or other costs suffered by Barsele from such loss of any director or 
officer.
Conflicts of Interest
Some  of  the  directors  and  officers  are  engaged  and  will  continue  to  be  engaged  in  the  search  for 
additional  business  opportunities  on  behalf  of  other  corporations,  and  situations  may  arise  where 
these directors and officers will be in direct competition with Barsele. Conflicts, if any, will be dealt 
with in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Business Corporations Act.
Some  of  the  directors  and  officers  of  Barsele  are  or  may  become  directors  or  officers  of  other 
companies  engaged  in  other  business  ventures.  In  order  to  avoid  the  possible  conflict  of  interest 
which may arise between the directors' duties to Barsele and their duties to the other companies on 
whose boards they serve, the directors and officers of Barsele have agreed to the following:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
participation in other business ventures offered to the directors and officers will be allocated 
between  the  various  companies  and  on  the  basis  of  prudent  business  judgment  and  the 
relative financial abilities and needs of the companies to participate;
no  commissions  or  other  extraordinary  consideration  will  be  paid  to  such  directors  and 
officers; and
business opportunities formulated by or through other companies in which the directors and 
officers are involved will not be offered to Barsele, except on the same or better terms than 
the basis on which they are offered to third party participants.
Impact of Hedging Activities on Profitability
Although Barsele has no present intention to do so, it may hedge a portion of any of its future gold or 
silver production to protect Barsele against low prices and/or to satisfy covenants required to obtain 
project financings. Hedging activities are intended to protect Barsele from the fluctuations of the price 
of gold or silver and to minimize the effect of declines in prices on results of operations for a period 
of time. Although hedging activities may protect a company against low prices, they may also limit 
the price that can be realized on that mineral that is subject to forward sales and call options where 
the market price of gold or silver exceeds the price in a forward sale or call opinion contract.
Influence of Third Party Stakeholders
The lands in which Barsele holds an interest, or the exploration equipment and road or other means 
of  access  which  Barsele  intends  to  utilize  in  carrying  out  its  work  programs  or  general  business
F-39
mandates may be subject to interests or claims by third parties. If any such third parties assert any 
claims, Barsele's work programs may be delayed even if such claims are not meritorious. Such delays 
may result in significant financial loss and loss of opportunity for Barsele.
Political and Economic Instability in Foreign Countries
Barsele's  mineral  properties  after  the  Arrangement  will  be  located  in  Sweden  and  Barsele  may 
acquire  mineral  property  interests  in  other  foreign  countries.  Exploration  in  foreign  jurisdictions 
exposes Barsele to risks that may not otherwise be experienced if all operations were domestic. The 
risks  include, but are  not  limited to  military repression, extreme fluctuations in currency exchange 
rates, labour instability or  militancy, socioeconomic conditions, mineral title irregularities and high 
rates of inflation. In addition, changes in mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude in 
foreign  countries  in  which  Barsele  operates  may  adversely  affect  its  business.  The  distribution  of 
earnings back to Canada would require Swedish currency to be reconverted to foreign currency for 
repatriation.  Barsele  may  be  affected  in  varying  degrees  by  government  regulation  with  respect  to 
restrictions  on  production,  price  controls,  export  controls,  income  taxes,  expropriation  of  property, 
maintenance of exploration or mining rights, environmental legislation, land use, land claims of local 
people, water use and mine safety.  The effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted. Political 
risks  may  adversely  affect  Barsele's  existing  assets  and  operations.  Barsele  does  not  maintain  and 
does  not  intend  to  purchase  political  risk  insurance.  Real  and  perceived  political  risks  in  some 
countries may also affect Barsele's ability to finance  exploration programs and  attract joint venture 
partners and may affect future mine development opportunities.
Price Volatility
Securities markets have recently had a high level of price and volume volatility, and the securities of 
many companies have experienced wide fluctuations in price which have not necessarily been related 
to  the  operating  performance,  underlying  asset  values  or  prospects  of  such  companies.  Factors 
unrelated  to  the  financial  performance  or  prospects  of  Barsele  may  include  macroeconomic 
developments  locally  and  globally  and  market  perceptions  of  the  attractiveness  of  particular 
industries. There can be no assurance that continued fluctuations in mineral prices will not occur. As 
a result of any of these factors, once the Spinco Shares are listed on the TSX-V, the market price of 
such shares at any given point in time may not accurately reflect the long term value of Barsele.
In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, shareholders 
have in some cases instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, 
if instituted, could result in substantial cost and diversion  of management attention and resources, 
which could significantly harm profitability and the reputation of Barsele.
Dilution
Barsele  will  require  additional  funds  in  respect  of  the  further  development  of  Barsele's  mineral 
projects. If Barsele raises funds by issuing additional equity securities, such financing will dilute the 
equity interests of its shareholders.
Discretion in the Use of Available Funds
Management will have broad discretion concerning the use of the available funds of Barsele as well 
as  the  timing  of  their  expenditures.  As  a  result,  shareholders  and  investors  will  be  relying  on  the 
judgment  of  management  of  Barsele  on  completion  of  the  Arrangement  for  the  application  of  the 
available funds of Barsele (see "Available Funds and Principal Purposes - Available Funds" and "Available 
Funds and Principal Purposes - Principal Purposes" above).  Management may use the available funds in
F-40
ways that an investor may not consider desirable. The results and the effectiveness of the application 
of the available funds are uncertain. If the available funds are not applied effectively, Barsele's results 
of operations may suffer.
Global Economy
Recent market events and conditions, including disruptions in the international credit markets and 
other financial systems and the deterioration of global economic conditions, could impede Barsele's 
access to capital or increase the cost of capital. From 2007 to 2009, the United States credit markets 
began to experience serious disruption due to deterioration in residential property values, defaults 
and delinquencies in the residential mortgage market and a decline in the credit quality of mortgage-
backed  securities.  These  problems  led  to  a  slow-down  in  residential  housing  market  transactions, 
declining  housing  prices,  delinquencies  in  non-mortgage  consumer  credit  and  a  general  decline  in 
consumer confidence. These conditions caused a loss of confidence in the broader United States and 
global credit and financial markets and resulted in the collapse of, and government intervention in, 
major  banks,  financial  institutions  and  insurers  and  created  a  climate  of  greater  volatility,  less 
liquidity, widening of credit spreads, a lack of price transparency, increased credit losses and tighter 
credit  conditions  which  continued  throughout  2012  with  continued  uncertainty  in  the  European 
marketplace and continued uncertainty surrounding the "fiscal cliff" and United States government 
spending  cuts.  Notwithstanding  various  actions  by  the  United  States  and  foreign  governments, 
concerns about the general condition of the capital markets, financial instruments, banks, investment 
banks, insurers and other financial institutions caused the broader credit markets to deteriorate and 
stock markets to fluctuate substantially.
These disruptions in the current credit and financial markets have had a significant material adverse 
impact on a number of financial institutions and have limited access to capital and credit for many 
companies, including junior mining companies. These disruptions could, among other things, make it 
more  difficult  for  Barsele  to  obtain,  or  increase  its  cost  of  obtaining,  capital  and  financing  for  its 
operations. Access to additional capital may not be available to Barsele on terms acceptable to it, or at 
all.
PROMOTERS
Orex took the initiative of founding and organizing Barsele and its business and operations and, as 
such,  may  be  considered  to  be  the  promoter  of  Barsele  for  the  purposes  of  applicable  securities 
legislation.  As  at  the  date  of  the  Circular,  Orex  is  the  sole  (100%)  shareholder  of  Barsele  and  will 
transfer  Orex's  45%  interest  in  the  Barsele  Project  to  Barsele  as  contemplated  by  the  terms  of  the 
Arrangement.  See  in  this  Appendix  F,  "Description  of  the  Business  -  General  Development  of  Barsele's 
Business",  "Description  of  the  Business  –  Barsele  Project,  Sweden"  and  "Prior  Sales".  See  also  in  the 
Circular,  "The  Meeting  –  The  Arrangement  —  Background  to  the  Arrangement",  "The  Meeting  –  The 
Arrangement — Reasons for the Arrangement" and "Information Concerning Orex after the Arrangement".
Assuming completion of the Arrangement in accordance with its terms, Orex Shareholders will hold 
approximately 100% of the then issued and outstanding Spinco Shares. See in this Appendix F, "Pro 
Forma  Capitalization  -  Consolidated  Capitalization"  and  see  in  the  Circular,  "The  Meeting  –The 
Arrangement — Principal Steps of the Arrangement".
Since its incorporation on April 25, 1996, Orex has not been subject to:
(a)
a cease trade order (including any management cease trade order which applied to directors 
or executive officers of a company, whether or not the person is named in the order), except 
as follows:
F-41
(b)
(c)
(i)
(ii)
On June 10, 2003, while Mr. Wilmot was a director and officer of CTF Technologies 
Inc. ("CTF"), CTF was subject to a cease trade order in British Columbia for failure to 
file  its  financial  statements  for  the  year ended  December  31,  2002, and  for  the  first 
quarter  ended  March  31,  2003,  due  to  the  CTF's  determination  in  late  2002  that  an 
accounting  change  to  the  manner  in  which  it  accounted  for  some  of  its  revenues 
would be appropriate. The financial statements were filed and the cease trade order 
was revoked on April 4, 2008;
On  September  7,  2007,  while  Mr.  Wilmot  was  a  director  of  Biotech  Holdings  Ltd. 
("Biotech"),  a  company  listed  on  the  TSX-V,  the  TSX-V  notified  Biotech  that  it  had 
initiated a review of its filings. Following review by the TSX-V in respect of certain 
compliance  matters  and  direct  discussions  with  the  TSX-V,  Biotech's  management 
decided to apply to delist the shares of Biotech from the TSX-V. Subsequently, Mr. 
Wilmot resigned as a director of Biotech on October 15, 2007;
an order similar to a cease trade order; or
an  order  that  denied  the  relevant  company  access  to  any  exemption  under  securities 
legislation, that was in effect for a period of more than 30 consecutive days;
nor has Orex been subject to:
(d)
(e)
any  penalties  or  sanctions  imposed  by  a  court  relating  to  securities  legislation  or  by  a 
securities regulatory authority or  has entered into a settlement agreement with  a securities 
regulatory authority; or
any other penalties or sanctions imposed by a court or regulatory body that would likely be 
considered important to a reasonable investor in making an investment decision,
nor  has  Orex  become  bankrupt,  made  a  proposal  under  any  legislation  relating  to  bankruptcy  or 
insolvency,  or  become  subject  to  or  instituted  any  proceedings,  arrangement  or  compromise  with 
creditors, or had a receiver manager or trustee appointed to hold its assets.

be  granted  from  time  to  time  pursuant  to  this  Plan  will  not  exceed  10%  of  the 
Corporation's  outstanding  Shares  (on  a  non-diluted  basis)  at  the  time  of  any  grant  of

of  the  Option  will  become  available  to  be  issued  upon  the  exercise  of  Options 
subsequently granted under this Plan.
Eligibility, Grant and Terms of Options
Options may be granted to any Eligible Person in accordance with Section 5.2.

are approved by the Board.
Subject to any adjustments pursuant to the provisions of Article 8 and Section 5.4 hereof, 
the Option Price of any Option will in no circumstances be lower than the Market Price.  
If, as and when any Shares have been duly purchased and paid for under the terms of an

the  Company  and  Barsele  Minerals  Corp.  will  be  determined  in  accordance  with  the 
terms of the Arrangement. For greater certainty and notwithstanding Section 5.3 hereof, 
the  Option  Price  of  Options  granted  under  the  Arrangement  may  be  lower  than  the 
Market Price at the time of granting of such Options, being the date of completion of the 
Arrangement.
Subject to Section 5.10, the term of an Option will not exceed five years from the date of 
the grant of the Option.
No Options will be granted to any Optionee if such grant could result, at any time, in:
(a)
the issuance to any one individual and any Company that is wholly-owned by 
that individual, within a one-year period, of a number of Shares exceeding 5% of 
the issued and outstanding Shares calculated on the date an Option is granted to 
that individual or any Company that is wholly-owned by the individual, unless 
the Company has obtained the requisite approval of disinterested Shareholders 
pursuant to the requirements of the Exchange Manual;
G-6
(b)
(c)
the  issuance  to  any  one  Consultant,  in  any  12  month  period,  of  a  number  of

the  issuance  to  all  Persons  conducting  Investor  Relations  Activities,  in  any  12-
month period, of an aggregate number of Shares exceeding 2% of the issued and 
outstanding  Shares  calculated  on  the  date  an  Option  is  granted  to  any  such 
Person,
unless permitted otherwise by the Exchange.

the Optionee will represent and confirm that the Optionee is a bona fide Employee or 
Consultant, as applicable.

(b)
An Option will vest and may be exercised (in each case to the nearest full Share) 
in whole or in part at any time during the term of such Option after the date of 
the grant as determined by the resolution of the Board granting the Option; or
in the case of an Option issued to a Person retained to provide Investor Relations 
Activities, must vest in stages over a period of not less than 12 months with no 
more than ¼ of such Option vesting in less than a three-month period within the 
first 12 months after such Option is issued.
5.9
No fractional Shares may be purchased or issued under this Plan.
5.10  Notwithstanding  anything  else  contained  in  this  Plan,  and  subject  to  the  application 
provisions  in  the  Exchange  Manual,  if  an  Option  expires  during  a  Blackout  Period 
applicable to the relevant Optionee, then the expiration date for that Option will be the 
date that is the tenth business day after the expiry date of such Blackout Period. This 
section applies to all Options outstanding under this Plan.

Termination of Employment or Engagement with the Corporation
Subject to Sections 6.2 and 6.3 hereof and to any express resolution passed by the Board 
with  respect  to  an  Option,  an  Option,  vested  or  unvested,  and  all  rights  to  purchase 
Optioned  Shares  pursuant  thereto  will  expire  and  terminate  immediately  upon  the 
Optionee  ceasing  to  be  an  Eligible  Person  in  any  capacity  and  does  not  otherwise 
become an Eligible Person in another capacity with 10 business days, provided that:
(a)
in  the  case  of  termination  of  employment  without  cause,  such  Option  and  all 
rights to purchase Optioned Shares in respect thereof will expire and terminate:
(i)
in the case of an Optionee who is an Eligible Person, 90 days following 
notice of termination of employment or on the Expiry Time, whichever is 
earlier; and

(ii)
in the case of an Optionee who is engaged in Investor Relations Activities, 
30 days following notice of termination to provide such Investor Relation 
Activities or on the Expiry Time, whichever is earlier; or
(b)
in  the  case  of  termination  for  cause,  such  Option  and  all  rights  to  purchase 
Optioned Shares in respect thereof will expire and terminate on the date of such 
termination will be cancelled as of that date or on the Expiry Time, whichever is 
earlier.
If, before the Expiry Time of an Option, an Optionee will cease to be an Eligible Person 
(an "Event of Termination") as a result of the Optionee's Disability, then the Board, at its 
discretion, may allow the Optionee to exercise any vested Options to the extent that the 
Optionee was entitled to do so at the time of such Event of Termination, at any time up 
to  and  including, but  not  after,  a  date  12  months  following  the  date  of  such  Event  of 
Termination or on the Expiry Time, whichever is earlier.
If  an  Optionee  dies  before  the  Expiry  Time  of  an  Option,  the  Optionee's  heirs, 
administrators or legal representative(s) may, subject to the terms of the Option and this 
Plan, exercise any vested Options to the extent that the Optionee was entitled to do so at 
the date of the Optionee's death at any time up to and including, but not after, a date 12 
months following the date of the Optionee's death or on the Expiry Time, whichever is 
earlier.
For greater certainty, an Option will not be affected by any change of employment of the 
Optionee or by the Optionee ceasing to be a director, senior officer or employee of the 
Corporation  or  any  of  its  Subsidiaries  provided  that  the  Optionee  continues  to  be  an 
Eligible Person.
If the Optionee is a Company that is wholly-owned by an Eligible Person, the references 
to the Optionee in this Article 6 will be deemed to refer to the Eligible Person associated 
with such Company.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article 6, the Board may when granting an 
Option to a Consultant impose specific rules respecting the cessation of participation of 
such Consultant, which rules may vary from, and will supersede, those contained in this 
Article 6.
Exercise of Options
Subject to the provisions of this Plan, an Option may be exercised from time to time by 
delivery to the Corporation at its principal office in Vancouver, British Columbia of a 
written  notice  of  exercise  (substantially  in  the  form  attached  hereto  as  Schedule  "B") 
specifying  the  number  of  Optioned  Shares  with  respect  to  which  the  Option  is  being 
exercised and accompanied by payment in full, by cash or cheque, of the Option Price of 
the  Shares  then  being  purchased  and,  if  required  by  the  Corporation,  the  amount 
necessary  to  satisfy  any  applicable  Withholding  Obligations.  The  Optioned  Shares  so 
purchased  will  be  issued  and  delivered  to  the  Optionee  within  a  reasonable  time 
following  the  receipt  of  such  notice  and  payment.  The  transfer  and  delivery  of  any
G-8
Optioned Shares issued upon exercise of any Option will be effected according to the 
procedures  established  by  the  transfer  agent  of  the  Corporation  for  the  transfer  and 
delivery of the Shares.
7.2
Notwithstanding  any  of  the  provisions  contained  in  this  Plan  or  in  any  Option,  the 
Corporation's obligation to issue Shares to an Optionee pursuant to the exercise of any 
Option will be subject to:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
completion of such registration or other qualification of such Shares or obtaining 
approval of such governmental or regulatory authority as the Corporation will 
determine  to  be  necessary  or  advisable  in  connection  with  the  authorization, 
issuance or sale thereof;
the admission of such Shares to listing on the Exchange;
the  receipt  from  the  Optionee  of  such  representations,  warranties,  agreements 
and undertakings, as the Corporation or its counsel determines to be necessary 
or advisable; and
the satisfaction of any conditions on exercise, including those prescribed under 
Section 3.4.
No member of the Board will be liable for any action or determination taken or made in 
good faith in the administration, interpretation, construction or application of this Plan 
or any Options granted under it.
Options will be evidenced by a share option agreement, instrument or certificate in such 
form not inconsistent with this Plan as the Board may from time to time determine as 
provided  for  under  Subsection 3.2(e)  (substantially  in  the  form  attached  as  Schedule 
"A").
Certain Adjustments
In  the  event  of  any  reorganization,  recapitalization,  stock  split,  stock  dividend, 
combination  of  shares,  merger,  consolidation,  rights  offering  or  any  other  corporate 
change involving a change to the Shares at any time after the grant of any Option to any 
Optionee  and  prior  to  the  expiration  of  the  term  of  such  Option,  such  Optionee  will 
receive at the time of any subsequent exercise of his or her Option in accordance with 
the terms hereof, in lieu of the number of Optioned Shares to which the Optionee was 
entitled  upon  such  exercise,  but  for  the  same  aggregate  consideration  therefor,  such 
number  of  Optioned  Shares  as  such  Optionee  would  have  held  as  a  result  of  such 
change if on the record date thereof the Optionee had been the registered holder of the 
number of Optioned Shares to which the Optionee was previously entitled upon such 
exercise.

Event  which  may  or  has  occurred,  to  make  such  arrangements  as  it  will  deem 
appropriate  for  the  exercise  of  outstanding  Options  including,  without  limitation,  to 
modify the terms of this Plan and/or the Options, subject to the prior written approval 
of the Exchange. If the Board exercises such power after having received such approval from

If this Plan is terminated, the provisions of this Plan and any administrative guidelines 
and  other  rules  and  regulations  adopted  by  the  Board  and  in  force  on  the  date  of 
termination will continue in effect as long as any Option or any rights pursuant thereto 
remain  outstanding  and,  notwithstanding  the  termination  of  this  Plan,  the  Board  will

issued  to  the  Optionee  on  the  exercise  of  Options  as  is  sufficient  to  fund  the

Optionee  to  withhold  from  the  proceeds  realized  from  such  sale  the 
amount  required  to  satisfy  any  such  Withholding  Obligations  and  to

(a)

and any action taken by the Corporation or any other Person pursuant to Section 11.1 
must be in compliance with the Exchange Manual.
12.  Miscellaneous Provisions
12.1
12.2
This Plan amends, restates and supersedes the 2014 Plan in its entirety and applies to all 
Options  granted  under  this  Plan  after  this  Plan  is  approved  by  shareholders  of  the 
Corporation and the Exchange.
The operation of this Plan and the issuance and exercise of all Options and Optioned 
Shares contemplated by this Plan are subject to compliance with all applicable laws, and 
all  rules  and  requirements  of  the  Exchange.  For  greater  certainty,  disinterested 
shareholder  approval  of  the  shareholders  of  the  Corporation  will  be  obtained  in 
connection  with  any  matter  regarding  this  Plan  where  required  by  the  Exchange 
Manual.
12.3  As  a  condition  of  participating  in  this  Plan,  each  Optionee  agrees  to  comply  with  all 
applicable  laws  and  the  policies  and  requirements  of  the  Exchange,  and  to  fully 
cooperate  with  the  Corporation  in  doing  all  such  things,  including  executing  and

information as is reasonably necessary to facilitate compliance with such laws, rules and 
requirements, including all Withholding Obligations.
12.4
Participation  in  this  Plan  is  voluntary  and  does  not  constitute  a  condition  of 
employment or continued employment or service. An Optionee will not have any rights 
as  a  shareholder  of  the  Corporation  with  respect  to  any  of  the  Optioned  Shares 
underlying  any  Option  until  the  date  of  issuance  of  a  certificate  for  Shares  upon  the 
exercise  of  such  Option,  in  full  or  in  part,  and  then  only  with  respect  to  the  Shares 
represented by such certificate or certificates. Without in any way limiting the generality 
of the foregoing, no adjustment will be made for dividends or other rights for which the 
record date is prior to the date such share certificate is issued.
G-13
12.5  Nothing in this Plan or any Option will confer upon an Optionee any right to continue 
or be re-elected as a director of the Corporation or any right to continue in the employ or 
engagement of the Corporation or any Subsidiary, or affect in any way the right of the 
Corporation or any Subsidiary to terminate the Optionee's employment or engagement 
at  any  time;  nor  will  anything  in  this  Plan  or  any  Option  be  deemed  or  construed  to 
constitute an agreement, or an expression of intent, on the part of the Corporation or any 
Subsidiary to extend the employment or engagement of any Optionee beyond the time 
which the Optionee would normally be retired pursuant to the provisions of any present 
or future retirement plan of the Corporation or any Subsidiary or any present or future 
retirement policy of the Corporation or any Subsidiary, or beyond the time at which the 
Optionee  would  otherwise  be  retired  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  any  contract  of 
employment with the Corporation or any Subsidiary.
12.6  An  Option  will  be  personal  to  the  Optionee  and  will  be  non-assignable  and  non-
transferable (whether by operation of law or otherwise), except as provided for herein. 
Upon  any  attempt  to  transfer,  assign,  pledge,  hypothecate  or  otherwise  dispose  of  an 
Option contrary to the provisions of this Plan, or upon the levy of any attachment or 
similar process upon an Option, the Option will, at the election of the Corporation, cease 
and  terminate  and  be  of  no  further  force  or  effect  whatsoever.  Notwithstanding  the 
above,  if  the  Optionee  is  a  Company  that is  wholly-owned  by  an  Eligible  Person,  the 
Option  may  be  transferred  or  assigned  between  the  Optionee  and  the  Eligible  Person 
associated with the Optionee.
12.7
This Plan (including any amendment to this Plan), the terms of the issue or grant of any 
Option  under  this  Plan,  the  grant  and  exercise  of  Options  hereunder,  and  the 
Corporation's  obligation  to  sell  and  deliver  Optioned  Shares  upon  the  exercise  of 
Options, will be subject to all applicable law and the requirements of the Exchange, and 
to such approvals by any regulatory or governmental agency as may, in the opinion of 
counsel  to  the  Corporation,  be  necessary  or  advisable.  The  Corporation  will  not  be 
obliged by any provision of this Plan or the grant of any Option hereunder to issue or 
sell  Shares  in  violation  of  such  laws,  rules  and  regulations  or  any  condition  of  such 
approvals.

Optioned  Shares  pursuant  thereto  will  expire  and  terminate  immediately  upon  the 
Optionee  ceasing  to  be  an  Eligible  Person  in  any  capacity  and  does  not  otherwise 
become an Eligible Person in another capacity with 10 business days, provided that:
(a)
in  the  case  of  termination  of  employment  without  cause,  such  Option  and  all 
rights to purchase Optioned Shares in respect thereof will expire and terminate:
(i)
(ii)
in the case of an Optionee who is an Eligible Person, 90 days following 
notice of termination of employment or on the Expiry Time, whichever is 
earlier; and
in the case of an Optionee who is engaged in Investor Relations Activities, 
30 days following notice of termination to provide such Investor Relation 
Activities or on the Expiry Time, whichever is earlier; or
(b)
in  the  case  of  termination  for  cause,  such  Option  and  all  rights  to  purchase 
Optioned Shares in respect thereof will expire and terminate on the date of such 
termination will be cancelled as of that date or on the Expiry Time, whichever is 
earlier.

7.1
If, before the Expiry Time of an Option, an Optionee will cease to be an Eligible Person 
(an "Event of Termination") as a result of the Optionee's Disability, then the Board, at its 
discretion, may allow the Optionee to exercise any vested Options to the extent that the 
Optionee was entitled to do so at the time of such Event of Termination, at any time up 
to  and  including, but  not  after,  a  date  12  months  following  the  date  of  such  Event  of 
Termination or on the Expiry Time, whichever is earlier.
If  an  Optionee  dies  before  the  Expiry  Time  of  an  Option,  the  Optionee's  heirs, 
administrators or legal representative(s) may, subject to the terms of the Option and this 
Plan, exercise any vested Options to the extent that the Optionee was entitled to do so at 
the date of the Optionee's death at any time up to and including, but not after, a date 12 
months following the date of the Optionee's death or on the Expiry Time, whichever is 
earlier.
For greater certainty, an Option will not be affected by any change of employment of the 
Optionee or by the Optionee ceasing to be a director, senior officer or employee of the 
Corporation  or  any  of  its  Subsidiaries  provided  that  the  Optionee  continues  to  be  an 
Eligible Person.
If the Optionee is a Company that is wholly-owned by an Eligible Person, the references 
to the Optionee in this Article 6 will be deemed to refer to the Eligible Person associated 
with such Company.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article 6, the Board may when granting an 
Option to a Consultant impose specific rules respecting the cessation of participation of 
such Consultant, which rules may vary from, and will supersede, those contained in this 
Article 6.
Exercise of Options
Subject to the provisions of this Plan, an Option may be exercised from time to time by 
delivery to the Corporation at its principal office in Vancouver, British Columbia of a 
written  notice  of  exercise  (substantially  in  the  form  attached  hereto  as  Schedule  "B") 
specifying  the  number  of  Optioned  Shares  with  respect  to  which  the  Option  is  being 
exercised and accompanied by payment in full, by cash or cheque, of the Option Price of 
the  Shares  then  being  purchased  and,  if  required  by  the  Corporation,  the  amount 
necessary  to  satisfy  any  applicable  Withholding  Obligations.  The  Optioned  Shares  so 
purchased  will  be  issued  and  delivered  to  the  Optionee  within  a  reasonable  time 
following  the  receipt  of  such  notice  and  payment.  The  transfer  and  delivery  of  any 
Optioned Shares issued upon exercise of any Option will be effected according to the 
procedures  established  by  the  transfer  agent  of  the  Corporation  for  the  transfer  and 
delivery of the Shares.
7.2
Notwithstanding  any  of  the  provisions  contained  in  this  Plan  or  in  any  Option,  the 
Corporation's obligation to issue Shares to an Optionee pursuant to the exercise of any 
Option will be subject to:
H-8
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
completion of such registration or other qualification of such Shares or obtaining 
approval of such governmental or regulatory authority as the Corporation will 
determine  to  be  necessary  or  advisable  in  connection  with  the  authorization, 
issuance or sale thereof;
the admission of such Shares to listing on the Exchange;
the  receipt  from  the  Optionee  of  such  representations,  warranties,  agreements 
and undertakings, as the Corporation or its counsel determines to be necessary 
or advisable; and
the satisfaction of any conditions on exercise, including those prescribed under 
Section 3.4.
No member of the Board will be liable for any action or determination taken or made in 
good faith in the administration, interpretation, construction or application of this Plan 
or any Options granted under it.
Options will be evidenced by a share option agreement, instrument or certificate in such 
form not inconsistent with this Plan as the Board may from time to time determine as 
provided  for  under  Subsection 3.2(e)  (substantially  in  the  form  attached  as  Schedule 
"A").
Certain Adjustments
In  the  event  of  any  reorganization,  recapitalization,  stock  split,  stock  dividend, 
combination  of  shares,  merger,  consolidation,  rights  offering  or  any  other  corporate 
change involving a change to the Shares at any time after the grant of any Option to any 
Optionee  and  prior  to  the  expiration  of  the  term  of  such  Option,  such  Optionee  will 
receive at the time of any subsequent exercise of his or her Option in accordance with 
the terms hereof, in lieu of the number of Optioned Shares to which the Optionee was 
entitled  upon  such  exercise,  but  for  the  same  aggregate  consideration  therefor,  such 
number  of  Optioned  Shares  as  such  Optionee  would  have  held  as  a  result  of  such 
change if on the record date thereof the Optionee had been the registered holder of the 
number of Optioned Shares to which the Optionee was previously entitled upon such 
exercise.
If the Corporation declares and pays a special cash dividend or other distribution out of 
the ordinary course, a special dividend in specie on the Shares, or a stock dividend other 
than in the ordinary course, the Option Price of all Options outstanding on the record 
date of such dividend or other distribution will be reduced by an amount equal to the 
cash payment or other distribution or the fair market value of the dividend in specie or 
stock dividend or other distribution, as determined by the Board  in its sole discretion 
but subject to all necessary regulatory approvals.

Change of Control Event
If at any time when an Option granted under this Plan remains unexercised with respect 
to any Shares and:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
(f)
a  Person  makes  an  offer  to  acquire  Shares  that,  regardless  of  whether  the 
acquisition is completed, would make the Person an Acquiring Person;
an  Acquiring  Person  makes  an  offer,  regardless  of  whether  the  acquisition  is 
completed, to acquire Shares;
the  Corporation  proposes  to  sell  all  or  substantially  all  of  its  assets  and 
undertaking;
the Corporation proposes to merge, amalgamate or be absorbed by or into any 
other  corporation  (save  and  except  for  a  Subsidiary)  under  any  circumstances 
which  involve  or  may  involve  or  require  the  liquidation  of  the  Corporation,  a 
distribution  of  its  assets  among  its  shareholders,  or  the  termination  of  the 
corporate existence of the Corporation;
the Corporation proposes an arrangement as a result of which a majority of the 
outstanding Shares of the Corporation would be acquired by a third party; or
any  other  form  of  transaction  is  proposed  which  the  majority  of  the  Board 
determines is reasonably likely to have similar effect any of the foregoing,
(each a "Change of Control Event"),
(g)
then, in connection with of any of the foregoing Change of Control Events, the 
Board  in  its  sole  discretion,  may  authorize  and  implement  one  or  more  of  the 
following courses of action:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
accelerate the vesting of the Option and the time for the fulfillment of any 
conditions  or  restrictions  on  such  vesting  to  a date  or  time  prior  to  the 
Effective  Time  of  the  Change  of  Control  Event,  and  any  Options  not 
exercised or surrendered by the Effective Time of the Change of Control 
Event will be deemed to have expired;
offer to acquire from each Optionee his or her Options for a cash payment 
equal to the In the Money Amount, and any Options not so surrendered 
or exercised by the Effective Time of the Change of Control Event will be 
deemed to have expired; and
that  an  Option  granted  under  this  Plan  be  exchanged  for  an  option  to 
acquire, for the same exercise price, that number and type of securities as 
would be distributed to the Optionee in respect of the Shares issued to the 
Optionee  had  the  Optionee  exercised  the  Option  prior  to  the  Effective 
Time  of  the  Change  of  Control  Event,  provided  that  any  such
H-10

10.
10.1
replacement option must provide that it survives for a period of not less 
than  one  year  from  the  Effective  Time  of  the  Change  of  Control  Event, 
regardless  of  the  continuing  directorship,  officership  or  employment  of 
the holder.
For  greater  certainty,  and  notwithstanding  anything  else  to  the  contrary  contained  in 
this  Plan,  the  Board  will  have  the  power,  in  its  discretion,  in  any  Change  of  Control 
Event  which  may  or  has  occurred,  to  make  such  arrangements  as  it  will  deem 
appropriate  for  the  exercise  of  outstanding  Options  including,  without  limitation,  to 
modify the terms of this Plan and/or the Options, subject to the prior written approval 
of the Exchange. If the Board exercises such power after having received such approval from 
the Exchange, the Options will be deemed to have been amended to permit the exercise 
thereof in whole or in part by the Optionee at any time or from time to time as determined 
by the Board prior to or in conjunction with completion of the Change of Control Event.
Amendment or Discontinuance of this Plan
The Board may suspend or terminate this Plan at any time, or from time to time amend 
the terms of this Plan or of any Option granted under this Plan and any stock option 
agreement  relating  thereto,  provided  that  any  such  suspension,  termination  or 
amendment:
(a)
(b)
(c)
complies with applicable law and the requirements of the Exchange, including 
applicable  requirements  relating  to  requisite  shareholder  approval  and  prior 
approval of the Exchange or any other relevant regulatory body;
is, in the case of an amendment that materially adversely affects the rights of any 
Optionee, made with consent of such Optionee; and
is, in the case of any reduction in the Option Price of Options held by Optionees 
that  are  Insiders  at  the  time  of  the  proposed  reduction,  subject  to  approval  by 
disinterested shareholders of the Corporation in accordance with the Exchange 
Manual.
10.2
If this Plan is terminated, the provisions of this Plan and any administrative guidelines 
and  other  rules  and  regulations  adopted  by  the  Board  and  in  force  on  the  date  of 
termination will continue in effect as long as any Option or any rights pursuant thereto 
remain  outstanding  and,  notwithstanding  the  termination  of  this  Plan,  the  Board  will 
remain able to make such amendments to this Plan or the Options as they would have 
been entitled to make if this Plan were still in effect.
10.3  No  amendment,  suspension  or  discontinuance  of  this  Plan  may  contravene  the 
requirements of the Exchange or any securities commission or regulatory body to which 
this Plan or the Corporation is now or may hereafter be subject.
H-11
11.  Withholding Obligations
11.1
The Corporation may withhold from any amount payable to an Optionee, either under 
this Plan or otherwise, such amounts as are required by law to be withheld or deducted 
as a consequence of the Optionee's exercise of Options or other participation in this Plan 
("Withholding Obligations"). The Corporation will have the right, in its discretion, to 
satisfy any Withholding Obligations by:
(a)
(b)
selling or causing to be sold, on behalf of any Optionee, such number of Shares 
issued  to  the  Optionee  on  the  exercise  of  Options  as  is  sufficient  to  fund  the 
Withholding Obligations;
retaining the amount necessary to satisfy the Withholding Obligations from any 
amount which would otherwise be delivered, provided or paid to the Optionee 
by the Corporation, whether under this Plan or otherwise;
(c)
requiring the Optionee, as a condition of exercise under Article 3 to:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
remit  the  amount  of  any  such  Withholding  Obligations  to  the 
Corporation in advance;
reimburse the Corporation for any such Withholding Obligations; or
cause a broker who sells Shares acquired by the Optionee on behalf of the 
Optionee  to  withhold  from  the  proceeds  realized  from  such  sale  the 
amount  required  to  satisfy  any  such  Withholding  Obligations  and  to 
remit such amount directly to the Corporation; and
(d)  making such other arrangements as the Corporation may reasonably require.
The sale of Shares by the Corporation, or by a broker engaged by the Corporation (the 
"Broker"), under this Section 11.1 will be made on the Exchange. The Optionee consents 
to such sale and grants to the Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney to effect the 
sale of such Shares on the Optionee's behalf and acknowledges and agrees that:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
the  number  of  Shares  sold  will,  at  a  minimum,  be  sufficient  to  fund 
Withholding  Obligations  net  of  all  selling  costs,  which  costs  are  the 
responsibility of the Optionee and which the Optionee hereby authorizes 
to be deducted from the proceeds of such sale;
in effecting the sale of any such shares, the Corporation or the Broker will 
exercise its sole judgement as to the timing and the manner of sale and 
will not be obligated to seek or obtain a minimum price; and
neither the Corporation nor the Broker will be liable for any loss arising 
out of any sale of such Shares including any loss relating to the pricing,  
manner or timing of such sales or any delay in transferring any Shares to 
an Optionee or otherwise.  The Optionee further acknowledges that the
H-12
sale  price  of  Shares  will  fluctuate  with  the  market  price  of  the 
Corporation's Shares and no assurance can be given that any particular 
price will be received upon any sale.
11.2
For greater certainty, no action may be taken by the Corporation or any other Person 
pursuant to Section 11.1 that would result in:
(a)
(b)
an alteration of the Exercise Price of the Options at issue; or
a cashless exercise of the Options at issue,
and any action taken by the Corporation or any other Person pursuant to Section 11.1 
must be in compliance with the Exchange Manual.
12.  Miscellaneous Provisions
12.1
12.2
This Plan applies to all Options granted under this Plan after this Plan is approved by 
shareholders of the Corporation and the Exchange.
The operation of this Plan and the issuance and exercise of all Options and Optioned 
Shares contemplated by this Plan are subject to compliance with all applicable laws, and 
all  rules  and  requirements  of  the  Exchange.  For  greater  certainty,  disinterested 
shareholder  approval  of  the  shareholders  of  the  Corporation  will  be  obtained  in 
connection  with  any  matter  regarding  this  Plan  where  required  by  the  Exchange 
Manual.
12.3  As  a  condition  of  participating  in  this  Plan,  each  Optionee  agrees  to  comply  with  all 
applicable  laws  and  the  policies  and  requirements  of  the  Exchange,  and  to  fully 
cooperate  with  the  Corporation  in  doing  all  such  things,  including  executing  and 
delivering all such agreements, undertakings or other documents or furnishing all such 
information as is reasonably necessary to facilitate compliance with such laws, rules and 
requirements, including all Withholding Obligations.
12.4
Participation  in  this  Plan  is  voluntary  and  does  not  constitute  a  condition  of 
employment or continued employment or service. An Optionee will not have any rights 
as  a  shareholder  of  the  Corporation  with  respect  to  any  of  the  Optioned  Shares 
underlying  any  Option  until  the  date  of  issuance  of  a  certificate  for  Shares  upon  the 
exercise  of  such  Option,  in  full  or  in  part,  and  then  only  with  respect  to  the  Shares 
represented by such certificate or certificates. Without in any way limiting the generality 
of the foregoing, no adjustment will be made for dividends or other rights for which the 
record date is prior to the date such share certificate is issued.
12.5  Nothing in this Plan or any Option will confer upon an Optionee any right to continue 
or be re-elected as a director of the Corporation or any right to continue in the employ or 
engagement of the Corporation or any Subsidiary, or affect in any way the right of the 
Corporation or any Subsidiary to terminate the Optionee's employment or engagement 
at  any  time;  nor  will  anything  in  this  Plan  or  any  Option  be  deemed  or  construed  to 
constitute an agreement, or an expression of intent, on the part of the Corporation or any
H-13
Subsidiary to extend the employment or engagement of any Optionee beyond the time 
which the Optionee would normally be retired pursuant to the provisions of any present 
or future retirement plan of the Corporation or any Subsidiary or any present or future 
retirement policy of the Corporation or any Subsidiary, or beyond the time at which the 
Optionee  would  otherwise  be  retired  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  any  contract  of 
employment with the Corporation or any Subsidiary.
12.6  An  Option  will  be  personal  to  the  Optionee  and  will  be  non-assignable  and  non-
transferable (whether by operation of law or otherwise), except as provided for herein. 
Upon  any  attempt  to  transfer,  assign,  pledge,  hypothecate  or  otherwise  dispose  of  an 
Option contrary to the provisions of this Plan, or upon the levy of any attachment or 
similar process upon an Option, the Option will, at the election of the Corporation, cease 
and  terminate  and  be  of  no  further  force  or  effect  whatsoever.  Notwithstanding  the 
above,  if  the  Optionee  is  a  Company  that is  wholly-owned  by  an  Eligible  Person,  the 
Option  may  be  transferred  or  assigned  between  the  Optionee  and  the  Eligible  Person 
associated with the Optionee.
12.7
This Plan (including any amendment to this Plan), the terms of the issue or grant of any 
Option  under  this  Plan,  the  grant  and  exercise  of  Options  hereunder,  and  the 
Corporation's  obligation  to  sell  and  deliver  Optioned  Shares  upon  the  exercise  of 
Options, will be subject to all applicable law and the requirements of the Exchange, and 
to such approvals by any regulatory or governmental agency as may, in the opinion of 
counsel  to  the  Corporation,  be  necessary  or  advisable.  The  Corporation  will  not  be 
obliged by any provision of this Plan or the grant of any Option hereunder to issue or 
sell  Shares  in  violation  of  such  laws,  rules  and  regulations  or  any  condition  of  such 
approvals.
12.8
This Plan  and  all  matters  to  which  reference  is made  herein  will  be  governed  by  and 
interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of British Columbia and the laws 
of Canada applicable therein.

AUDIT COMMITTEE CHARTER OF OREX AND BARSELE AFTER THE ARRANGEMENT
APPENDIX I
For the purposes of this Appendix I, the Company means each of Orex after the Arrangement and 
Barsele, as applicable.
PURPOSE
The purpose of the Audit Committee (the "Committee") is to assist the Board of Directors in fulfilling 
its  oversight  responsibilities  by  reviewing  the  financial  information  which  will  be  provided  to  the 
shareholders  and  others;  reviewing  the  systems  of  internal  controls  which  management  and  the 
Board  of  Directors  have  established;  appointing,  retaining  and  overseeing  the  performance  of 
independent  accountants;  and  overseeing  the  Company's  accounting  and  financial  reporting 
processes and the audits of the Company's financial statements.
The Committee will fulfill  these responsibilities by carrying out the activities defined below  under 
"Duties  and  Responsibilities."  The  Committee  will  be  given  full  and  direct  access  to  the  Board 
Chairman,  Company  executives,  and  independent  accountants  as  necessary  to  carry  out  these 
responsibilities. However, the Committee's function is one of oversight only and will not relieve the 
Company's  management  of  its  responsibilities  for  preparing  financial  statements  which  accurately 
and  fairly  present  the  Company's  financial  results  and  condition,  or  the  responsibilities  of  the 
independent accountants relating to the audit or review of financial statements.

BARSELE MINERALS CORP.
FINANCIAL STATEMENT
(Expressed in Canadian Dollars)
APRIL 30, 2015

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
To the Directors of 
Barsele Minerals Corp. 
 
 
We have audited the accompanying financial statement of Barsele Minerals Corp., which comprise the statement of financial 
position as at April 30, 2015 and 2014, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. 
 
Management's Responsibility for the financial statements 
 
Management  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  the  financial  statement  in  accordance  with 
International Financial Reporting Standards, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable 
the preparation of the financial statement that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
Auditors' Responsibility  
 
Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  financial  statement  based  on  our  audit.    We  conducted  our  audit  in 
accordance  with  Canadian  generally  accepted  auditing  standards.    Those  standards  require  that  we  comply  with  ethical 
requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statement is free from 
material misstatement. 
 
An  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain  audit  evidence  about  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial 
statement.    The  procedures  selected  depend  on  the  auditors'  judgment,  including  the  assessment  of  the  risks  of  material 
misstatement  of  the  financial  statement,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error.    In  making  those  risk  assessments,  the  auditor 
considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement in order to design 
audit  procedures  that  are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the 
effectiveness of the entity's internal control.   An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of 
the financial statement. 
 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained in our audit is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion. 
 
Opinion 
 
In our opinion, the financial statement presents fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Barsele Minerals Corp. 
as at April 30, 2015 and 2014 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. 
 
Emphasis of Matter 
 
Without  qualifying  our  opinion,  we  draw  attention  to  Note  1  in  the  financial  statement  which  describes  conditions  and 
matters that indicate the existence of a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt about Barsele Minerals Corp.'s 
ability to continue as a going concern.

NATURE AND CONTINUANCE OF OPERATIONS
Barsele  Minerals  Corp.  (the  "Company")  was  incorporated  under  the  laws  of  the  Province  of  British  Columbia, 
Canada on February 20, 2013 and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orex Minerals Inc. ("Orex").   
 
The head office of the Company is located at Suite 1130 - 1055 West Hastings Street, Vancouver, BC, Canada, V6C 
2E9. The registered address and records office of the Company is located at Suite 1700, Park Place, 666 Burrard 
Street, Vancouver, BC, Canada V6C 2X8. 
 
Orex is in the process of completing an arrangement as described in Note 4 that will result in the Company holding a 
45%  interest  in  Gunnarn  Mining  AB  ("Gunnarn")  which  holds  title  to  various  exploration  properties  located  in 
Sweden.
This financial statement reflects the financial position of the Company as at April 30, 2015 and 2014.The Company 
has  not  conducted  any  operating  activities  for  the  years  ended  April  30,  2015  and  2014  and  accordingly  no 
statements of operations, cash flows or changes in shareholders' equity have been presented. 
 
While this financial statement has been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the realization of assets 
and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business, there are conditions that cast significant doubt on the 
validity of this assumption. The Company has no sources of funding and its business and arrangement disclosed in 
Note 4 are dependent on approvals by the shareholders of Orex, applicable regulatory authorities and the Supreme 
Court of British Columbia. 
 
 
 
BASIS OF PREPARATION
This financial statement, including comparatives, has been prepared using accounting policies consistent with IFRS 
as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and interpretations issued by the International Financial 
Reporting Interpretations Committee.
SHARE CAPITAL
The Company's authorized share capital consists of an unlimited number of common shares without par value.
Upon incorporation on February 20, 2013, the Company issued one common share at a price of $1.
SUBSEQUENT EVENT
Subsequent  to  April  30,  2015,  the  Company  is  a  party  to  a  proposed  plan  of  arrangement  (the  "Arrangement") 
involving  Orex,  the  Company,  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  Orex,  and  the  security  holders  of  Orex.  The 
Arrangement is primarily being conducted in order for Orex to spin out its 45% interest in Gunnarn, the corporate 
entity which owns 100% of the Barsele Gold Project ("Barsele Project") in Sweden to the Company, which will be a 
separate publicly-listed company following completion of the Arrangement.
J-5
Under the Arrangement, the security holders of Orex will be entitled to receive: 
 
(cid:120)
for  each  Orex  common  share  held  (an  "Orex  Share"),  one  new  common  share  of  Orex  (a  "New  Common 
Share") and one common share of the Company (a "Company Share");
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
for each unexercised option to purchase an Orex Share, one fully-vested option to purchase from Orex one New 
Common  Share  and  one  fully-vested  option  to  purchase  from  the  Company  one  Company  Share,  each  with 
adjusted exercise prices to reflect the respective valuations of Orex and the Company; and
for each unexercised warrant to purchase an Orex Share, one warrant to purchase from Orex one New Common 
Share and one warrant to purchase from the Company one Company Share, each with the same exercise price as 
the Orex warrant for which such warrants are exchanged.
As a result of the Arrangement, the Company will hold Orex's 45% interest in the Barsele Project, which is subject 
to a joint venture with Agnico Eagle Mines Limited, and Orex will retain the other mineral assets currently held by 
Orex, including the Los Crestones Project and Coneto Project in Mexico and the Jumping Josephine Project in 
British Columbia, Canada. Upon completion of the Arrangement, each Orex shareholder will retain its respective 
interest in Orex and hold a proportional interest in the Company.

Orex Minerals Inc. 
Notes to the Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Unaudited - Expressed in Canadian dollars) 
 
1.  Basis of presentation 
 
The  unaudited  pro  forma  consolidated  financial  statements  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  audited 
consolidated financial statements for the year ended April 30, 2015 of Orex Minerals Inc. ("Orex") and the audited 
financial  statement  for  the  year  ended  April  30,  2015  of  Barsele  Minerals  Corp.  ("Barsele").    These  pro  forma 
consolidated financial statements have been compiled from and include: 
 
a) an unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of financial position as at April 30, 2015 is derived from the 
audited consolidated statement of financial position of Orex as at April 30, 2015 with the audited statement of 
financial position of Barsele as at April 30, 2015; 
 
b)  an  unaudited  pro  forma  consolidated  statement  of  comprehensive  loss  for  the  year  ended  April  30,  2015  is 
derived from the audited consolidated statement of comprehensive loss of Orex for the year ended April 30, 2015. 
 
In  the  opinion  of  management,  the  pro  forma  consolidated  financial  statements  presented  include  all  of  the 
adjustments and assumptions, contained in Notes 2 to 3, necessary for fair presentation.  The pro forma unaudited 
consolidated statement of financial position is presented as though the transaction occurred on April 30, 2015. The 
pro forma consolidated statement of comprehensive loss for the year ended April 30, 2015 has been prepared as if 
the transaction occurred at May 1, 2014. 
 
These  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  same  accounting  policies  and  methods  of 
application as the most recent audited financial statements of Orex for the year ended April 30, 2015, except that 
they do not include all note disclosures required for annual audited financial statements. 
 
These unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes and are not 
intended to reflect the financial statements that would have occurred if the events reflected therein had been in 
effect at the closing date. Actual amounts recorded upon consummation of the transaction will differ from those 
recorded in the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements and the differences may be material. 
 
2.  Plan of Arrangement 
 
Orex is a party to a proposed plan of arrangement (the "Arrangement") involving Orex, Barsele, a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of Orex, and the security holders of Orex. The Arrangement is primarily being conducted in order for

Project  ("Barsele  Project")  in  Sweden  to  Barsele,  which  will  be  a  separate  publicly-listed  company  following 
completion of the Arrangement.
