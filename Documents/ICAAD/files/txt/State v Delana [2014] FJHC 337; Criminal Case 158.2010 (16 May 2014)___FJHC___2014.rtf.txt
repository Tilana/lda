Particulars of Offence

FILIPE DELANA on the 22nd day of July 2010, at Suva, in the Central Division stole vehicle registration number DX110, the property of PRANIT NARAYAN.

1.      
In the unanimous opinion of three assessors you are both found to be guilty of the robbery and you Delana, guilty of the theft.

2.      
The evidence in this case, once identification is accepted and voluntariness of the 2nd accused caution interview is accepted, is overwhelming. Both victims of the robbery had little hesitation in identifying the first accused and the second accused had made admissions to the robbery in his caution interview.

3.      
In directing myself on my own summing up and in giving weight to the assessors' opinions, I agree with the assessors and find you both guilty of the robbery and you Delana guilty of the theft. You are both convicted accordingly.

4.      
That is the judgment of the Court

P.K. Madigan
Judge.
