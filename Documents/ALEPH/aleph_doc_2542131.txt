CGG Press Release
CGG notes the announcement made by Technip today that it no longer intends to file a tender
offer for CGG.
Since the beginning of this unsolicited approach by Technip on November 10, CGG remained
open to dialogue and studied all proposals of Technip taking into account the interests of its
shareholders, clients and employees. The board of CGG considered that none of the proposed
options were creating value for the Company and its stakeholders.
CGG remains confident in the ongoing execution and the success of its strategy as an
independent company. CGG is showing a solid resilient operational performance as highlighted
in the third quarter results with important progresses achieved and milestones met in the
transformation plan and the strengthening of the balance sheet.
With this plan initiated one year ago, accelerated and intensified during the year 2014 and with
priorities given to cash generation, CGG is in a position to weather current difficult market
conditions while fully benefiting from future geoscience market rebound.
