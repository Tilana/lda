To:
The Securityholders of ECU Silver Mining Inc. (“ECU”)
The board of directors (the “ECU Board”) of ECU invites you to attend a special meeting (the “Meeting”) of the 
holders (collectively, the “ECU Securityholders”) of outstanding: (i) common shares of ECU (“ECU Shares”, and 
the  holders  thereof,  the  “ECU Shareholders”);  (ii)  options  to  purchase  ECU  Shares  (“ECU Options”,  and  the 
holders thereof, the “ECU Optionholders”); (iii) warrants exercisable to acquire ECU Shares (“ECU Warrants”, 
and the holders thereof, the “ECU Warrantholders”); and (iv) 0.0% convertible senior unsecured notes due June 
30,  2012  of  ECU  (the  “ECU  Convertible  Notes”,  and  the  holder  thereof,  the  “ECU  Convertible  Noteholder”) 
(ECU Shares, ECU Options, ECU Warrants and ECU Convertible Notes are collectively, “ECU Securities”), to be 
held at 11:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on August 30, 2011 at the Crescent Room of Hôtel Le Crystal, 1100 rue de la 
Montagne, Montreal, Québec H3G 0A1.
On  June  24,  2011,  ECU  entered  into  an  arrangement  agreement  (the  “Arrangement  Agreement”)  with  Golden 
Minerals  Company  (“Golden”)  whereby,  subject  to  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  Arrangement  Agreement, 
Golden will acquire all of the outstanding ECU Shares, ECU Options and ECU Warrants, and the ECU Convertible 
Notes will be replaced with non-convertible notes, pursuant to an arrangement under the Business Corporations Act
(Québec) (the  “Arrangement”). Assuming the  Arrangement becomes effective: (a) the  ECU Shareholders (other 
than  dissenting  shareholders  and  Golden)  will  receive  0.05  (the  “Exchange  Ratio”)  shares  of  common  stock  of 
Golden (“Golden  Stock”) and Cdn$0.000394 in cash for  each ECU  Share  held; (b) the ECU Optionholders  will 
receive  options  to  acquire  Golden  Stock  (“Golden  Replacement  Options”)  and  the  ECU  Warrantholders  will 
receive warrants to acquire Golden Stock (“Golden Replacement Warrants”) in replacement of their outstanding 
ECU Options and ECU Warrants, as applicable, in each case exercisable to acquire that number of shares of Golden 
Stock  that  such  holders  would  have  acquired  if  they  had  exercised  their  ECU  Options  or  ECU  Warrants,  as 
applicable, immediately prior to the effective time of the Arrangement and had received ECU Shares in exchange 
therefor,  with  the  exercise  price  of  the  Golden  Replacement  Options  and  Golden  Replacement  Warrants  being 
adjusted  based  on  the  Exchange  Ratio;  (c)  the  ECU  Convertible  Noteholder  will  receive  notes  of  ECU  in 
replacement of its outstanding ECU Convertible Notes that are identical to the ECU Convertible Notes except that 
they will not be convertible into ECU Shares; and (d) the current shareholder rights plan of ECU will be terminated 
and  all  rights  issued  pursuant  thereto  will  expire,  all  as  more  particularly  described  in  the  accompanying 
management  information  circular  of  ECU  dated  July  29,  2011  (the  “Circular”).    At  the  Meeting,  the  ECU 
Securityholders will be asked to approve the Arrangement.
After  careful  consideration  of  various  factors  described  more  fully  in  the  Circular,  including  a  fairness 
opinion  issued  by  Stonecap  Securities  Inc.,  a  Canadian  registered  investment  dealer,  and  following 
consultation  with  its  financial  and  legal  advisors,  the  ECU  Board  has  unanimously  determined  that  the 
Arrangement is in the best interests of ECU and is fair to the ECU Securityholders from a financial point of 
view.  Accordingly, the ECU Board unanimously recommends that ECU Securityholders (other than Golden 
and its affiliates, for which no recommendation is provided) vote FOR the Arrangement.
The ECU Board believes that the combined company resulting from the Arrangement will be a new leading junior 
silver mining company with an attractive portfolio of assets in Mexico, Argentina and Peru, with increased leverage 
to silver and gold and with significant credits to zinc and lead. The ECU Board believes the combined company will 
have greater scale and financial strength to advance the expansion and development of current mining properties, 
and improved access to global capital markets to assist future growth efforts. The Arrangement would combine the 
complementary  management  teams  of  ECU  and  Golden,  whose  proven  track  records  of  success  are  expected  to 
result in the enhancement and expansion of the portfolio of assets of the combined company.
To be effective, the Arrangement must be approved by a resolution (the “Arrangement Resolution”) passed by: (a) 
at least 66 2/3% of the votes cast by ECU Shareholders present in person or represented by proxy at the Meeting and
entitled to vote; (b) at least 66 2/3% of the votes cast by all ECU Securityholders, voting together as a single class, 
present in person or represented by proxy at the Meeting and entitled to vote; and (c) a simple majority of the votes 
cast by ECU Shareholders present in person or represented by proxy at the Meeting and entitled to vote, excluding 
the votes cast in respect of ECU Shares beneficially owned or over which control or direction is exercised by Mr. 
Michel Roy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ECU, and Mr. Stephen J. Altmann, President of ECU, and by 
their respective related parties or joint actors.  ECU Shareholders, ECU Optionholders and ECU Warrantholders are 
entitled to one vote for each ECU Share, ECU Option or ECU Warrant, as applicable, held by them, and the ECU 
Convertible Noteholder is entitled to such number of votes as is equal to the number of ECU Shares into which the 
ECU Convertible Notes held by it are convertible.  The directors and officers of ECU have entered into a voting 
agreement with Golden, whereby they have agreed to vote their ECU Securities in favour of the Arrangement.  The 
Arrangement is also subject to approval by the Superior Court of Québec and to the  satisfaction of certain other 
conditions.
The accompanying Circular provides a description of the Arrangement and includes certain additional information 
to assist  you in considering how to  vote on the  Arrangement  Resolution. You are urged to read this information 
carefully and, if you require assistance, to consult your tax, financial, legal or other professional advisors.
ECU has engaged Kingsdale Shareholder Services Inc. to provide proxy solicitation services to ECU and to act as 
information  agent  to  provide  a  resource  for  information  for  ECU  Securityholders.  Questions  and  requests  for

appropriate enclosed letter of transmittal in accordance with the instructions set out therein and in the Circular so 
that if the Arrangement is completed, the cash and shares of Golden Stock and the Golden Replacement Warrants, as 
the  case  may  be,  to  which  you  are  entitled  can  be  sent  to  you  as  soon  as  possible  following  completion  of  the 
Arrangement. Note that there are two different forms of letter of transmittal, one for ECU Shares (printed on blue 
paper) and one for ECU Warrants (printed on yellow paper).
If you hold ECU Securities through a broker, investment dealer, bank, trust company, trustee or other intermediary, 
please  follow  the  instructions  provided  by  your  intermediary  to  ensure  your  vote  is  counted  at  the  Meeting  and 
arrange for your intermediary to complete the necessary transmittal documents to ensure that you receive cash and 
Golden Stock or Golden Replacement Warrants, as the case  may be, in exchange  for your ECU Securities if the 
proposed Arrangement is completed.
Subject to obtaining the approvals of the ECU Securityholders and the Superior Court of Québec, and to satisfying 
certain other conditions, the Arrangement is expected to close on or about September 2, 2011.
Yours very truly,
(signed) “Michel Roy”

the applicable register of ECU Securityholders as of 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the Record Date are entitled to receive

Meeting.
An  ECU  Securityholder may  attend  the  Meeting  in  person  or  may  be  represented  by  proxy.    ECU 
Securityholders who are unable to attend the Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof in person 
are requested to date, sign and return the appropriate accompanying form of proxy for use at the Meeting or any 
adjournment or postponement thereof.  To be effective, such proxy must be received by Computershare Investor

review the Circular carefully before submitting such form(s) of proxy.
If  you  are  an  unregistered  holder  of  ECU  Securities  and  have  received  these  materials  through  your  broker, 
investment dealer, bank, trust company, trustee or other intermediary, please complete and return the form of

Pursuant to the Interim Order, each registered ECU Shareholder as of the Record Date is entitled to exercise dissent 
rights in respect of the Plan of Arrangement and, if the Plan of Arrangement becomes effective, to receive the fair value 
of  such  holder’s  ECU  Shares,  in  accordance  with  the  QBCA as  modified  by  the  Interim  Order  and  the  Plan  of 
Arrangement.  To exercise such right, (a) a written notice of intent to exercise its right to demand the repurchase of its 
ECU  Shares  must  be  received  from  the  registered  ECU  Shareholder  by  ECU  at  its  registered  office  at  1116  ave.
Granada,  Rouyn-Noranda,  Québec  J9Y 1G9  no  later  than  5:00  p.m.  (Eastern  Time)  on  August  26,  2011,  or  two 
Business Days prior to the reconvening of any adjournment or postponement of the Meeting, (b) the ECU Shareholder 
must exercise all the voting rights carried by the ECU Shares held by such ECU Shareholder against the Arrangement 
Resolution, and (c) the ECU Shareholder must have otherwise complied with the provisions of the QBCA as modified 
by  the  Interim  Order  and  the  Plan  of  Arrangement  respecting  the  exercise  of  dissent  rights.    The  right  to  dissent  is 
described  in  the  Circular  and  the  text  of  the  Interim  Order  is  set  forth  in  Appendix  E  to  the  Circular.  For  greater 
certainty, there are no dissent rights with respect to ECU Options, ECU Warrants or ECU Convertible Notes.
Persons who are beneficial owners of ECU Shares registered in the name of a broker, investment dealer, bank, 
trust  company,  custodian,  nominee  or  other  intermediary  who  wish  to  dissent  should  be  aware  that  only 
registered holders of ECU Shares as of the Record Date are entitled to dissent rights.  Accordingly, a beneficial 
owner of ECU Shares desiring to exercise this right must make arrangements for the ECU Shares beneficially owned by 
such person to be registered in his, her or its name prior to the time the written notice of intention to exercise its dissent 
rights in respect of the Plan of Arrangement is required to be received by ECU or, alternatively, make arrangements for 
the registered holder of ECU Shares to exercise the dissent rights on his, her or its behalf. Failure to strictly comply 
with the requirements set forth in the QBCA, the Interim Order and the Plan of Arrangement may result in the 
loss of any dissent rights.
If you require any assistance in completing your proxy, please contact Kingsdale Shareholder Services Inc. by calling

Capitalized terms in this part of this Circular not otherwise defined have the meanings set out in the Glossary of 
Terms in this Circular.
NOTE TO UNITED STATES SECURITYHOLDERS
THE  GOLDEN  SECURITIES  AND  ECU  REPLACEMENT  NOTES  ISSUABLE  IN  CONNECTION  WITH  THE 
ARRANGEMENT HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES 
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR SECURITIES REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN ANY STATE, NOR HAS 
THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR THE SECURITIES REGULATORY
AUTHORITIES  OF  ANY  STATE  PASSED  UPON  THE  ADEQUACY  OR  ACCURACY  OF  THIS  CIRCULAR. 
ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.
The  Golden  Stock,  Golden  Replacement  Options  and  Golden  Replacement  Warrants  to  be  issued  under  the 
Arrangement have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act, and are being issued in reliance on the exemption 
from registration set forth in Section 3(a)(10) thereof on the basis of the approval of the Court, which will consider, 
among other things, the fairness of the terms and condition of the Arrangement to the ECU Securityholders.  The ECU 
Replacement  Notes  have  not  been  registered  under  the  U.S.  Securities  Act,  and  are  being  issued  in  reliance  on  the 
exemption from registration set forth in Section 3(a)(9) thereof.  See “Securities Laws Considerations – U.S. Securities 
Laws.”
Information  concerning  the  properties  and  operations  of  ECU  and  Golden  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with 
Canadian standards under applicable Canadian Securities Laws, and may not be comparable to similar information for 
U.S.  companies.  The  terms  “mineral  resource”,  “measured  mineral  resource”,  “indicated  mineral  resource”  and 
“inferred mineral resource” used in this Circular or in ECU’s documents incorporated by reference herein are Canadian 
mining terms as defined in accordance with NI 43-101 under definitions and guidelines set out by the CIM in the CIM 
Standards.  While  the  terms  “mineral  resource”,  “measured  mineral  resource”,  “indicated  mineral  resource”  and 
“inferred mineral resource” are recognized and required by Canadian Securities Laws, they are not defined terms under 
standards  of  the  SEC.  As  such,  certain  information  contained  in  this  Circular  or  in  the  documents  incorporated  by 
reference herein concerning descriptions of mineralization and resources under Canadian standards is not comparable to 
similar information made public by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC. An 
“inferred  mineral  resource”  has  a  great  amount  of  uncertainty  as  to  its  existence  and  as  to  its  economic  and  legal 
feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an “inferred mineral resource” will ever be upgraded to a higher 
category. Under Canadian Securities Laws, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility 
or  other  economic  studies.  Investors  are  cautioned  not  to  assume  that  all  or  any  part  of  measured  mineral 
resources  or  indicated  mineral  resources  will  ever  be  converted  into  mineral  reserves.  Investors  are  also 
cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists, or is economically or legally 
mineable.
In addition, the definitions of “proven mineral reserve” and “probable mineral reserve” under CIM Standards differ in 
certain respects from the SEC standards.
ECU Securityholders should be aware that the acquisition of the securities described herein may have tax consequences 
both in the United States and in Canada. Such consequences for investors who are resident in, or citizens of, the United 
States  may  not  be  described  fully  herein.    See  “Certain  United  States  Federal  Income  Tax  Considerations.”  U.S. 
securityholders should consult their own tax advisors with respect to their own particular circumstances.
The  solicitation  of  proxies  hereby  is  not  subject  to  the  proxy  requirements  of  Section  14(a)  of  the  U.S.  Securities 
Exchange Act. Accordingly, this Circular has been prepared in accordance with applicable disclosure requirements in 
Canada. ECU Securityholders in the United States should be aware that such requirements are different than those of the 
United States.
Certain  financial  statements  and  information  included  or  incorporated  by  reference  herein  have  been  prepared  in

liabilities under the federal securities laws of the United States or “blue sky” laws of any state within the United States. 
In addition, U.S. securityholders should not assume that the courts of Canada: (a) would enforce judgments of United 
States courts obtained in actions against such persons predicated upon civil liabilities under the federal securities laws of 
the United States or “blue sky” laws of any state within the United States; or (b) would enforce, in original actions, 
liabilities against such persons predicated upon civil liabilities under the federal securities laws of the United States or 
“blue sky” laws of any state within the United States.

discussed in this Circular. Although ECU has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actions, events or 
results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements and forward-looking information in this 
Circular, including the documents incorporated by reference herein, there may be other factors that cause actions, events 
or results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended.  There is no assurance that such statements will prove to be 
accurate  as  actual  results  and  future  events  could  differ  materially  from  those  anticipated  in  such  statements  or 
information.
Certain  of  the  forward-looking  statements  and  forward-looking  information  and  other  information  contained  herein 
concerning the mining industry and ECU’s general expectations concerning the mining industry, ECU, Golden and the 
Combined Company, are based on estimates prepared by ECU or Golden using data from publicly available industry 
sources as well as from market research and industry analysis and on assumptions based on data and knowledge of this 
industry  which  ECU  believes  to  be  reasonable.  However,  although  generally  indicative  of  relative  market  positions, 
market  shares  and  performance  characteristics,  these  data  are  inherently  imprecise.  While  ECU  is  not  aware  of  any 
misstatement regarding any industry data presented herein, the mining industry involves risks and uncertainties that are 
subject to change based on various factors.
ECU  Securityholders  are  cautioned  not  to  place  undue  reliance  on  forward-looking  statements  and  forward-looking 
information in this Circular or incorporated by reference herein.  ECU undertakes no obligation to update any of the

U.S.  GAAP  and  translated  to  U.S.  dollars  (such  adjusted  financial  statements  are  included  as  Appendix  J  to  this 
Circular),  and  ECU’s  audited  consolidated  financial  statements  (amended)  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2010,

Arrangement  with  respect  to  fractional  Golden  Securities  otherwise  receivable  thereunder,  (a)  ECU  Shareholders  (other 
than Dissenting Shareholders and Golden) will receive 0.05 shares of Golden Stock and Cdn$0.000394 in cash for each 
ECU Share held; (b) ECU Optionholders will receive Golden Replacement Options and ECU Warrantholders will receive 
Golden  Replacement  Warrants  in  replacement  of  their  outstanding  ECU  Options  and  ECU  Warrants,  respectively, 
exercisable to acquire that number of shares of Golden Stock that such holders would have acquired if they had exercised 
their ECU Options or ECU Warrants, as applicable, immediately prior to the Effective Time and had received ECU Shares 
in exchange therefor, with the exercise price of the Golden Replacement Options and the Golden Replacement Warrants 
being adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio; (c) the ECU Convertible Noteholder will receive ECU Replacement Notes in 
replacement of its outstanding ECU Convertible Notes; and (d) the Shareholder Rights Plan will be terminated and all SRP 
Rights will expire.
See “The Arrangement”.
Votes Required to Approve the Arrangement
In order for the Arrangement to be effective, the Arrangement Resolution must be approved by: (a) at least 66 2/3% of the 
votes cast by ECU Shareholders present in person or represented by proxy at the Meeting and entitled to vote; (b) at least 
66 2/3% of the votes cast by all ECU Securityholders, voting together as a single class, present in person or represented by 
proxy at the Meeting and entitled to vote; and (c) a simple majority of the votes cast by ECU Shareholders present in person 
or  represented  by  proxy  at  the  Meeting  and  entitled  to  vote  after  excluding  the  votes  cast  in  respect  of  ECU  Shares

Officer of ECU, and Mr. Stephen J. Altmann, President of ECU, and by their respective related parties or joint actors.  Each 
ECU Security that is voted at the Meeting will vote only once on the Arrangement Resolution but three separate tabulations 
of the votes will be conducted, one for each of the foregoing required approvals.  ECU Shareholders, ECU Optionholders 
and ECU Warrantholders are entitled to one vote for each ECU Share, ECU Option or ECU Warrant, as applicable, held by 
them, and the ECU Convertible Noteholder is currently entitled to 15,480,000 votes (being such number of votes as is equal

exchange for their ECU Options and ECU Warrants, respectively, Golden Replacement Options and Golden Replacement 
Warrants,  as  applicable,  adjusted  based  on  the  Exchange  Ratio,  and  the  ECU  Convertible  Noteholder  will  receive  ECU 
Replacement  Notes.    The  Arrangement  is  to  be  carried  out  pursuant  to  the  Arrangement  Agreement  and  the  Plan  of

therefor to persons  who cease to be employees, officers,  directors or consultants of ECU or any of its 
affiliates within 180 days of the Effective Date shall expire on the date that is the earlier of (I) two years 
following the Effective Date and (II) the original expiry date of such ECU Options;

outstanding ECU Options and ECU Warrants are exercised before consummation of the Arrangement.
See “The Arrangement – Terms of the Arrangement”.
Recommendation of the ECU Board
ECU retained the Financial Advisor to act as its financial advisor and retained the Fairness Advisor to provide the Fairness 
Opinion.  The Fairness Advisor has provided a written opinion to the ECU Board, as at June 23, 2011, and subject to the 
assumptions, limitations and qualifications set forth therein, that the Consideration to be paid by Golden to holders of ECU 
Shares (other than Golden and its affiliates) pursuant to the terms of the Arrangement is fair, from a financial point of view, 
to  the  holders  of  ECU  Shares  (other  than  Golden  and  its  affiliates).    The  ECU  Board,  having  taken  into  account  such 
opinion  of  the  Fairness  Advisor  and  such  other  matters  as  it  considered  relevant,  has  unanimously  determined  that  the 
Arrangement  is  in  the  best  interests  of  ECU  and  is  fair  to  the  ECU  Securityholders  from  a  financial  point  of  view.  
Accordingly,  the  ECU  Board  unanimously  recommends  that  ECU  Securityholders  (other  than  Golden  and  its 
affiliates for which no recommendation is provided) vote FOR the Arrangement Resolution.
See “The Arrangement – Recommendation of the ECU Board”.
Reasons for the Arrangement
In  the  course  of  their  evaluation  of  the  Arrangement,  the  ECU  Board  consulted  with  ECU’s  senior  management,  legal 
counsel, the Financial Advisor and the Fairness Advisor, reviewed a significant amount of information and considered a 
number of factors which show compelling business reasons for the Arrangement, including, among others, the following:
!
Review  of  Strategic  Alternatives.    The  Arrangement  was  arrived  at  following  an  extensive  review  of  strategic 
alternatives which was conducted with the assistance of the Financial Advisor, including considering a range of 
potential transactions with a number of possible counterparties identified by the Financial Advisor and agreed to 
by ECU.

The Arrangement creates a combined company with greater scale and financial strength and an enhanced capital 
markets profile:
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
the Combined Company is expected to have sufficient cash to advance expansion plans at the Velardeña 
District Properties and the continued development of the El Quevar Project; 
the  Combined  Company’s  basic  market  capitalization  will  be  over  US$600  million,  based  upon  the 
closing  trading  prices of  ECU  and  Golden  as  at  June  23,  2011,  with  an  expected  increased  liquidity 
profile on both the NYSE Amex and the TSX; and
the Combined Company’s increased scale is expected to improve access to global capital markets to assist 
future growth efforts.
The Arrangement combines complementary management teams with proven track records of success to enhance 
and expand the existing portfolio of combined assets:
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
Golden’s  management  team  has  strong  expertise  and  a  proven  track  record  in  mine  building  and 
operations,  which  can  be  leveraged  in  order  to  seek  to  optimize  and  potentially  expand  the  Velardeña 
District Properties mining operations;
ECU has an operations team totalling nearly 500 people that can operate mines and mills in Mexico as 
required by the planning team;
ECU’s exploration expertise is expected to further enhance exploration efforts at the El Quevar Project, 
the Zacatecas Project and other drill testing projects across South America; and
the Combined Company will have a large portfolio of projects which, combined with enhanced scale and 
broader reach, will create opportunities for growth in existing and new jurisdictions.
The Arrangement increases leverage to precious metals with significant base metals credits:
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
the Combined Company will have combined measured mineral resources and indicated mineral resources 
of approximately 25 million ounces silver, 0.3 million ounces gold, 26 million pounds lead and 37 million 
pounds zinc;
the  Combined  Company  will  have  combined  inferred  mineral  resources  of  approximately  187  million 
ounces silver, 2 million ounces gold, 1 billion pounds lead and 1 billion pounds zinc; and
the Combined Company will have opportunities to expand its current resource base in Mexico, Argentina 
and Peru.
The  Arrangement  creates  a  new  leading  junior  silver  mining  company  with  an  attractive  portfolio  of  assets 
consisting of:
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
the silver, gold and base metals mining operations in the Velardeña Mining District;
the advanced exploration-stage El Quevar Project in the Salta Province, Argentina;
the advanced exploration-stage Zacatecas Project in Zacatecas, Mexico;
a number of drill testing projects in Peru (Cochabamba, Jehuamarca), Mexico (La Pinta) and Argentina 
(Atlas); and
a large portfolio of approximately 40 exploration properties in the reconnaissance/target delineation stage 
located primarily in South America.
Continued Participation by ECU Shareholders in Velardeña District Properties.  ECU Shareholders, through their 
ownership  of  Golden  Stock,  will  continue  to  participate  in  any  value  increases  associated  with  the  Velardeña 
District Properties.
Increased Portfolio of Silver Assets.  The Arrangement continues the strategy to which ECU Securityholders are 
currently exposed of building a portfolio of quality silver producing assets in low political risk jurisdictions.
Exchange Ratio.  The following is a discussion of the Exchange Ratio in relation to trading prices of ECU Shares 
and Golden Stock on the TSX and other Canadian trading platforms (collectively, the “Canadian Market”) and 
trading prices of Golden Stock on the TSX and on the NYSE Amex and trading platforms in the United States (the 
NYSE  Amex  and  U.S.  trading  platforms,  collectively,  the  “U.S.  Market”).  Whereas  the  Exchange  Ratio

represents a discount of 7% based on the closing trading prices of the ECU Shares and Golden Stock on the TSX 
on June 23, 2011, the last trading day prior to the date of announcement of the proposed Arrangement (6% if based 
on the closing trading prices of Golden Stock in the U.S. Market and the ECU Shares in the Canadian Market on 
such date), based on the VWAP for the 20 trading days ended June 23, 2011 in each case as indicated below, the 
Exchange Ratio represents a modest premium or an “at-market” transaction:
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
the Exchange Ratio represents a premium of approximately 7% to the VWAP of the ECU Shares in the 
Canadian Market based on the June 23, 2011 closing trading price of Golden Stock in the U.S. Market 
(where most of Golden Stock trades);
the Exchange Ratio represents a premium of approximately 4% to the VWAP of the ECU Shares on the 
TSX based on the June 23, 2011 closing trading price of Golden Stock on the TSX; and
the Exchange Ratio represents an “at-market” transaction based on the VWAP of the ECU Shares in the 
Canadian Market and the VWAP of Golden Stock on the U.S. Market (or a 2% discount to the VWAP of 
the ECU Shares on the TSX, based on the VWAP of Golden Stock on the TSX).
The  Financial  Advisor  and  the  Fairness  Advisor.  The  ECU  Board  considered  the  financial  presentations  and 
advice of the Financial Advisor, as well as the Fairness Opinion of the Fairness Advisor delivered orally to the 
ECU Board on June 23, 2011, and subsequently confirmed in writing as of such date, as to the fairness, from a 
financial  point  of  view,  of  the  Consideration  to  be  received  by  ECU  Shareholders,  other  than  Golden  and  its 
affiliates, under the Arrangement.  The written Fairness Opinion is attached as Appendix D to this Circular.
Alternatives to the Arrangement.  The ECU Board will remain able to respond, in accordance with its fiduciary 
duties, to bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposals that are more favourable to ECU Shareholders than 
the Arrangement and constitute Superior Proposals under the Arrangment Agreement.  Under such circumstances, 
subject to payment of the ECU Termination Fee in the amount of Cdn$10 million, ECU may, in accordance with 
the  Arrangement  Agreement,  terminate  the  Arrangement  Agreement  and  approve  and  recommend  any  such 
Superior Proposal if Golden does not exercise its right to match such Superior Proposal in accordance with the 
Arrangement Agreement. The Golden Board has the same rights under the Arrangment Agreement, and Golden 
would be subject to payment of the Golden Termination Fee in the amount of Cdn$10 million if the Golden Board
wished  to  terminate  the  Arrangement  Agreement  and  approve  and  recommend  any  Superior  Proposal  made  to 
Golden if ECU does not exercise its right to match such Superior Proposal in accordance with the Arrangement 
Agreement.
Intervening Events.  The ECU Board will also remain able to respond, in accordance with its fiduciary duties, to 
the  occurrence  of  any  Intervening  Event.  Under  such  circumstances,  ECU  may,  in  accordance  with  the 
Arrangement  Agreement,  change  its  recommendation  in  favour  of  the  approval  of  the  Arrangement  Resolution 
(subject to payment of the ECU Termination Fee if Golden elects to terminate the Arrangement Agreement as a 
result  of  such  change  of  recommendation)  if  Golden  does  not  exercise  its  right  to  respond  to  such  Intervening 
Event to the satisfaction of the ECU Board in accordance with the Arrangement Agreement.  The Golden Board 
will also be able to similary respond to any Intervening Event.
Termination Fee Reasonable. The ECU Board believes that the ECU Termination Fee payable to Golden in certain 
circumstances is reasonable and not preclusive of other proposals.
Voting Agreement. The directors and officers of ECU, being the ECU Locked-Up Securityholders, who in total 
held approximately 1.5% of the outstanding ECU Shares, approximately 87.9% of the outstanding ECU Options, 
none of the outstanding February 2009 Warrants and none of the outstanding December 2009 Warrants as at June 
24, 2011, entered into the Voting Agreement with Golden pursuant to which they agreed, among other things, to 
vote in favour of the Arrangement Resolution.
Required Securityholder and Court Approvals. The ECU Board considered the following rights and approvals to 
protect ECU Securityholders:
(cid:2)
the Arrangement Resolution must be approved at the Meeting by: (a) at least 66 2/3% of the votes cast by 
ECU Shareholders; (b) at least 66 2/3% of the votes cast by all ECU Securityholders, voting together as a

single class; and (c) a simple majority of the votes cast by ECU Shareholders after excluding the votes 
cast in respect of ECU Shares beneficially owned or over which control or direction is exercised by Mr. 
Michel Roy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ECU, and Mr. Stephen J. Altmann, President of 
ECU, and by their respective related parties or joint actors;
the Arrangement must be approved by the Court, which will consider, among other things, the fairness of 
the Arrangement to ECU Securityholders; and
ECU Shareholders are entitled to exercise Dissent Rights in respect of the Arrangement.
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
Reasonable  Terms  of  the  Arrangement  Agreement.  The  terms  and  conditions  of  the  Arrangement  Agreement, 
including ECU’s and Golden’s representations,  warranties and covenants, and the conditions to their respective 
obligations are, in the judgment of ECU, after consultation with its legal counsel, reasonable.
Likelihood of Completion. It is likely that the conditions to complete the Arrangement will be satisfied, including 
taking into account the nature of the approvals required by both ECU and Golden to be obtained as a condition to 
completing the Arrangement.
No Material Regulatory Issues. There are no material competition or other regulatory issues which are expected to 
arise in connection with the Arrangement so as to prevent its completion, and all required regulatory clearances 
and approvals are expected to be obtained.
Free to Support Superior Proposal. If a Superior Proposal is made to ECU Shareholders, ECU Securityholders 
other than the ECU Locked-Up Securityholders are free to support such Superior Proposal and vote against the 
Arrangement Resolution. In the event that the Arrangement Agreement is terminated by ECU or Golden to enable 
ECU to enter into an acquisition agreement  with a third party that  has  made a Superior Proposal and the ECU 
Termination Fee is paid, then the Voting Agreement to which the ECU Locked-Up Securityholders are party will 
also terminate and such securityholders will also be free to support such Superior Proposal.
Free  to  Support  Intervening  Event.  If  an  Intervening  Event  occurs,  ECU  Securityholders  other  than  the  ECU 
Locked-Up Securityholders are free to vote against the Arrangement Resolution. In the event that the Arrangement 
Agreement is terminated by Golden as a result of ECU changing its recommendation in favour of the approval of 
the Arrangement Resolution and the ECU Termination Fee is paid, then the Voting Agreement to which the ECU 
Locked-Up Securityholders are party will also terminate and such Securityholders will also be free to vote against 
the Arrangement Resolution.
Independent  Advice.  ECU  retained  independent  financial  and  legal  advisors  who  advised  ECU  throughout  the 
process as noted above.
Arm’s-length  Negotiations.  The  Arrangement  Agreement  is  a  result  of  arm’s-length  negotiations  between  ECU 
and Golden.

Risk Factors of the Arrangement
In the course of its deliberations, the ECU Board also identified and considered a variety of risks and potentially negative 
factors in connection with the Arrangement, including, but not limited to, the following:
!
!
The Exchange Ratio is fixed and, as a result, the Golden Stock issued on closing of the Arrangement may have a 
market value different than at the time of announcement of the Arrangement.
The completion of the Arrangement is subject to several conditions that must be satisfied or waived.

The Arrangement Agreement may be terminated by ECU or Golden in certain circumstances, in which case the 
market price for ECU Shares may be adversely affected.
The  Combined  Company  will  incur  significant  transaction,  combination-related  and  restructuring  costs  in 
connection with the Arrangement.
The  Combined  Company  may  incur  significant  costs  related  to  contractual  arrangements  that  are  not  currently 
anticipated.
The exercise of Dissent Rights  may increase the consideration payable pursuant to the  Plan of  Arrangement or 
hinder the closing of the Arrangement.
The  directors  and  officers  of  ECU  may  have  interests  that  are  different  from  the  interests  of  other  ECU 
Securityholders.
The trading price of Golden Stock could be depressed by sales of shares of Golden Stock by ECU Securityholders 
or Golden Stockholders who sell their shares of Golden Stock.
The existence of a significant number of options and warrants may have a negative effect on the market price of 
Golden Stock.
The  ECU  Termination  Fee  provided  for  under  the  Arrangement  Agreement  may  discourage  other  parties  from 
attempting to acquire ECU. If ECU is required to pay the ECU Termination Fee and an alternative transaction is 
not completed, ECU’s financial condition will be materially adversely affected.
If ECU is required to pay the expense reimbursement fee contemplated by the Arrangement Agreement in certain 
circumstances, ECU’s financial condition will be materially adversely affected.
The Arrangement  will present challenges associated  with integrating operations, personnel and other aspects of 
ECU and Golden.
ECU  and  Golden  have  both  historically  incurred  operating  losses  and  operating  cash  flow  deficits  and  it  is 
expected that the Combined Company will continue to incur operating losses in the foreseeable future.
ECU’s and Golden’s properties may not contain mineral reserves.
The Combined Company is expected to continue to require substantial external financing to pay its operating and 
general and administrative expenses, continue the advancement of the Velardeña Property expansion and the El 
Quevar Project and fund its other exploration activities.
The  Combined  Company  will  be  subject  to  a  broad  range  of  Environmental  Laws  and  associated  costs  and 
liabilities.
The long-term cash flow and profitability of the Combined Company will be affected by changes in the prices of 
silver and other metals.
If the Combined Company is unable to obtain all of its required governmental permits or obtain property rights on 
favourable terms or at all, its operations could be negatively impacted.
The Combined Company may not meet key production or cost estimates.

Voting Agreement
Each of the ECU  Locked-Up Securityholders, holding in the aggregate, as of July 22, 2011, approximately 1.5% of the 
outstanding ECU Shares and approximately 87.9% of the outstanding ECU Options, has entered into the Voting Agreement 
pursuant  to  which  each  ECU  Locked-Up  Securityholder  has  agreed,  subject  to  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  Voting 
Agreement, among other things:

to vote all of its ECU Securities in support of the Arrangement Resolution;
not to solicit or encourage the initiation of any inquiries or proposals, or participate in any substantive discussions, 
regarding an Acquisition Proposal, and not to approve or recommend, or accept or enter into any agreement or 
arrangement regarding, any Acquisition Proposal;
not to sell, assign, encumber, hypothecate or otherwise convey or dispose of any ECU Securities, or any right or 
interest therein;
not to grant any proxy or other right to vote any ECU Securities (except in favour of the Arrangement Resolution), 
or enter into any voting trust or other agreement with respect to the right to vote or give consents or approval of 
any kind as to any ECU Securities;
not  to  take  any  other  action  which  might  reasonably  be  regarded  as  likely  to  prevent,  hinder  or  delay  the 
Arrangement or the other transactions contemplated by the Arrangement Agreement and the Voting Agreement;
not to vote any ECU Securities in a manner which might reasonably be regarded as likely to prevent, hinder or 
delay the Arrangement;
to use all commercially reasonable efforts to assist ECU and Golden to successfully complete the Arrangement;
to irrevocably waive all of its rights to exercise Dissent Rights;
in the event that any transaction other than the Arrangement is presented for approval of ECU Securityholders, not 
to vote in favour of, accept, assist or otherwise further the successful completion of such transaction;
not to purchase or enter into any agreement to purchase any securities of ECU’s subsidiaries; and
to take all such steps as are necessary or advisable to ensure that its ECU Securities will not be subject to any 
shareholders’ agreements, voting trust or other agreement affecting or restricting its ability to exercise all voting 
rights attaching to its ECU Securities.
However,  nothing  contained  in  the  Voting  Agreement  restricts  an  ECU  Locked-Up  Securityholder  from  exercising  its 
director  or  officer  fiduciary  duties  to  ECU,  or  requires  the  ECU  Locked-Up  Securityholder,  solely  in  its  capacity  as  an 
officer  of  ECU,  to  take  any  action  in  contravention  of  instructions  or  directions  of  the  ECU  Board  undertaken  in  the 
exercise  of  their  fiduciary  duties,  in  each  case  subject  to  certain  conditions.  Nevertheless,  each  ECU  Locked-Up 
Securityholder shall remain obligated to vote all of its ECU Securities in the manner provided for by the Voting Agreement

Opinion of the Fairness Advisor
As at the date of its opinion and based on the information and procedures described therein, and subject to the assumptions, 
limitations and qualifications set forth in its Fairness Opinion, the Fairness Advisor has concluded that the Consideration of 
0.05 shares of Golden Stock and Cdn$0.000394 in cash per ECU Share to be paid by Golden to holders of ECU Shares 
(other than Golden and its affiliates) pursuant to the terms of the Arrangement is fair, from a financial point of view, to the 
holders of ECU Shares (other than Golden and its affiliates).
See “The Arrangement – Opinion of the Fairness Advisor” and the Fairness Opinion, which is attached as Appendix D.
Private Placement
On June 24, 2011, Golden and ECU entered into the Subscription Agreement pursuant to which ECU issued to Golden, on 
July 13, 2011, Cdn$15.0 million principal amount of ECU Convertible Notes. The Private Placement is intended to provide 
ECU with interim financing of its operations pending consummation of the Arrangement. The ECU Convertible Notes will 
mature on June 30, 2012 (subject to extension as described below), and are convertible by Golden at any time prior to 5:00 
p.m. (Eastern Time) on June 29, 2012 into ECU Shares at a rate of 1,032 ECU Shares for each Cdn$1,000 in principal 
amount converted, consistent with the Exchange Ratio.  Upon the occurrence of certain specified fundamental changes, the 
ECU Convertible Notes may be redeemed or converted into ECU Shares at the option of Golden based on 102% of the 
outstanding principal amount of the ECU Convertible Notes. The ECU Convertible Notes are also redeemable by ECU at 
any time after the Record Date and prior to their maturity date at 100% of their face value plus accrued and unpaid interest.  
ECU may elect to extend the maturity of the ECU Convertible Notes to December 31, 2012 upon the making of a cash 
payment to Golden equal to 4% of the face value of the then outstanding ECU Convertible Notes, payable on the day the 
extension  option  is  exercised,  with  interest  accruing  on  the  ECU  Convertible  Notes  at  10%  per  annum  during  such 
extension period.
Under the terms of the ECU Convertible Notes, the proceeds of the Private Placement are held in an escrow account and 
may  only  be  used  by  ECU  for  specified  purposes,  including  (i) expenses  associated  with  development,  exploration, 
operating and general and administrative costs (including base salaries and employee benefits) relating to the development 
and  operating  activities  at  the  Velardeña  Property;  (ii) general  and  administrative  expenses,  including  base  salaries, 
employee benefits and the various expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Arrangement 
Agreement; (iii) regularly scheduled principal and interest payments on arm’s length indebtedness existing at the date of 
issuance of the ECU Convertible Notes; and (iv) such other expenditures as may be approved by Golden.  Bonus payments, 
severance payments, change of control payments or other termination payments are not permitted uses.  At the closing of 
the Private Placement, Cdn$2.85 million of the subscription proceeds  were released to ECU and the Cdn$12.15 million 
balance of the proceeds were placed in escrow.
Golden will have the right to vote the ECU Convertible Notes on the Arrangement Resolution at the Meeting together with 
the outstanding ECU Shares, ECU Options and ECU Warrants voting as a single class. The ECU Convertible Notes shall 
be  entitled  to  such  number  of  votes  at  the  Meeting  as  is  equal  to  the  number  of  ECU  Shares  into  which  the  ECU 
Convertible Notes are convertible, currently being 15,480,000 votes.
See “The Arrangement – Private Placement”.

if you have any questions, or require assistance completing your Proxy.
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any person (other than the other Party or any 
of  its  affiliates)  regarding,  or  that  would  be  reasonably  expected  to  lead  to,  an  Acquisition 
Proposal;
approve,  accept,  endorse  or  recommend,  or  propose  publicly  to  accept,  approve,  endorse  or

Adverse Recommendation Change; Superior Proposal; Right to Match or Respond
ECU  may  make  an  ECU  Board  Change  in  Recommendation  and  Golden  may  make  a  Golden  Board  Change  in 
Recommendation (i) following receipt of an Acquisition Proposal that it determines to be a Superior Proposal or (ii) solely 
in response to any Intervening Event, in each case if it determines in good faith, after consultation with its legal advisors, 
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
Upon payment of the ECU Termination Fee, the ECU Board may terminate the Arrangement Agreement in order to accept 
and enter into an agreement in respect of an Acquisition Proposal that the ECU Board in good faith, after consultation with 
its  financial  and  outside  legal  advisors,  has  determined  is  a  Superior  Proposal.  Golden  will  have  the  right,  but  not  the 
obligation, to amend the terms of the Arrangement upon notification by ECU of a Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, 
as applicable, within a five (5) Business Day response period. Within five (5) Business Days of receiving any such proposal 
by Golden to amend the terms of the Arrangement, the ECU Board shall review and determine whether the Acquisition 
Proposal  to  which  Golden  is  responding  would  continue  to  be  a  Superior  Proposal,  or  whether  the  Adverse 
Recommendation  Change  is  still  necessary,  when  assessed  in  light  of  the  Arrangement  Agreement  and  the  Plan  of 
Arrangement as they are proposed by Golden to be amended. If the ECU Board determines that, in light of the proposed 
amendment  by  Golden,  the  Acquisition  Proposal  to  which  Golden  is  responding  would  not  continue  to  be  a  Superior 
Proposal, or the Adverse Recommendation Change would not be necessary, ECU is required to enter into an amendment to 
the  Arrangement  Agreement  to  give  effect  to  such  amendments  and  the  ECU  Board  must  promptly  reaffirm  its 
recommendation of the Plan of Arrangement.
Reciprocally, upon payment of the Golden Termination Fee, the Golden Board may terminate the Arrangement Agreement 
in order to accept and enter into an agreement in respect of an Acquisition Proposal that the Golden Board in good faith, 
after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors, has determined is a Superior Proposal. ECU will have the 
right, but not the obligation, to amend the terms of the Arrangement upon notification by Golden of a Superior Proposal or 
Intervening  Event,  as  applicable,  within  a  five  (5)  Business  Day  response  period.  Within  five  (5)  Business  Days  of 
receiving any such proposal by ECU to amend the terms of the Arrangement, the Golden Board shall review and determine 
whether the Acquisition Proposal to which ECU is responding would continue to be a Superior Proposal, or whether the
- 20 -

if you have any questions, or require assistance completing your Proxy.
Adverse Recommendation Change is still necessary, when assessed in light of the Arrangement Agreement and the Plan of 
Arrangement as they are proposed by ECU to be amended. If the Golden Board determines that, in light of the proposed 
amendment by ECU, the Acquisition Proposal to which ECU is responding would not continue to be a Superior Proposal, 
or the Adverse Recommendation Change would not be necessary, Golden is required to enter into an amendment to the 
Arrangement  Agreement  to  give  effect  to  such  amendments  and  the  Golden  Board  must  promptly  reaffirm  its 
recommendation of the Plan of Arrangement.

by any person, other than Golden or any of its affiliates;
(iii)
and, in either case:
(A)
(B)
within  12  months  following  the  date  of  such  termination  an  Acquisition 
Proposal relating to ECU is consummated; or
within  6  months  following  the  date  of  such  termination  ECU  and/or  one  or 
more of its subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement in respect of, or the 
ECU  Board  approves  or  recommends,  a 
transaction  contemplated  by 
subparagraph (c)(i) above and that transaction is subsequently consummated at 
any time thereafter.

default  of  any  of  its  obligations  or  covenants  under  the  Arrangement  Agreement  with  respect  to  non-
solicitation or the right to match, or under the Exclusivity Agreement;
by  Golden  following  the  authorization  by  the  Golden  Board  to  enter  into  a  binding  written  agreement 
relating to a Superior Proposal in accordance with the terms of the Arrangement Agreement; or

Golden Share Issuance Proposal shall have failed to receive the requisite Golden Stockholder approval, or 
by ECU due to a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform a covenant by Golden that

satisfied by the Outside Date (provided ECU is not then in breach so as to cause any of such conditions 
not  to  be  satisfied)  or  if  the  Golden  Meeting  has  not  occurred  within  95  days  from  the  date  of  the 
Arrangement Agreement (unless ECU’s failure to fulfil any obligation is the direct cause of, or directly 
results in, the failure of the Golden Meeting to occur on or before such date), but only if:
(i)
(ii)
in the case of termination of the Arrangement Agreement by reason of the Effective Date not 
having occurred by the Outside Date or pursuant to a breach of any representation or warranty 
or failure to perform a covenant by Golden that would cause the mutual conditions precedent

publicly announced by any person, other than ECU or any of its affiliates;
(iii)

(A)
(B)
within  12  months  following  the  date  of  such  termination  an  Acquisition 
Proposal relating to Golden is consummated; or
within 6 months following the date of such termination Golden and/or one or 
more of its subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement in respect of, or the 
Golden  Board  approves  or  recommends,  a  transaction  contemplated  by 
subparagraph (c)(i) above and that transaction is subsequently consummated at 
any time thereafter.

securities”, “20% or more of the consolidated revenue”, “20% or more of the consolidated operating income” and “20% or

“40% or more of the consolidated operating income” and “50% or more of the fair market value of the consolidated assets”,

Expense Reimbursement

ECU that would cause the mutual conditions precedent and conditions precedent in favour of ECU not to 
be  satisfied  or  if  the  Meeting  has  not  occurred  within  95  days  from  the  date  of  the  Arrangement 
Agreement, ECU shall pay to Golden Cdn$2,500,000 as an expense reimbursement; and
by  ECU  as  a  result  of  a  breach  of  any  representation  or  warranty  or  failure to  perform  a  covenant  by 
Golden that would cause the mutual conditions precedent and conditions precedent in favour of ECU not 
to be satisfied or if the Golden Meeting has not occurred within 95 days from the date of the Arrangement

required by the Court (if so required);
ECU may propose to amend, modify or supplement the Plan of Arrangement at any time prior to or at the 
Meeting, provided that Golden has consented to such amendment, modification or supplement, with or 
without  any  other  prior  notice  or  communication  and,  if  so  proposed  and  accepted  by  the  ECU 
Securityholders voting at the Meeting, such amendment, modification or supplement shall become part of 
the Plan of Arrangement for all purposes; and
any amendment, modification or supplement to the Plan of Arrangement that is approved by the Court 
following the Meeting shall be effective only if it is consented to in writing by ECU and Golden and, if 
required by the Court, is consented to by the ECU Securityholders.

if you have any questions, or require assistance completing your Proxy.
Payment of Consideration
Following receipt of the Final Order and prior to the filing of the Articles of Arrangement with the Enterprise Registrar, 
Golden shall deposit with the Depositary in escrow, for the benefit of holders of ECU Securities, sufficient funds, shares of 
Golden Stock and Golden Replacement Warrants in the aggregate amounts necessary to pay the Consideration required by 
the Plan of Arrangement.
Subject  to  surrender  to  the  Depositary  for  cancellation  of  a  holder’s  ECU  Share  certificate  or  ECU  Warrant  certificate, 
together with the duly completed and executed appropriate Letter of Transmittal (included with this Circular and printed on 
blue  paper  in  the  case  of  ECU  Shares  and  printed  on yellow  paper  in  the  case  of  ECU  Warrants)  and  such  additional 
documents  and  instruments  as  the  Depositary  may  reasonably  require,  following  the  Effective  Time  the  holder  of  such 
surrendered  certificate  shall  be  entitled  to  receive  the  Consideration  to  which  such  holder  is  entitled  under  the  Plan  of 
Arrangement, less any amounts required to be deducted and withheld under applicable Laws in respect of taxes, and any 
certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
Until  surrendered,  each  ECU  Share  certificate  or  ECU  Warrant  certificate  shall  be  deemed  after  the  Effective  Time  to 
represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled in lieu of 
such certificate under the Plan of Arrangement, less any amounts required to be deducted and withheld under applicable 
Laws in respect of taxes. Any such certificate formerly representing ECU Shares or ECU Warrants not duly surrendered on 
or before the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date shall cease to represent a claim by, or interest of, any former holder of 
ECU Shares or ECU Warrants of any kind or nature against or in ECU or Golden and be deemed to have been surrendered 
to Golden and shall be cancelled.
Any right or claim to payment pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement that remains outstanding on the sixth anniversary of the 
Effective Date shall cease to represent a right or claim of any kind or nature whatsoever and the right of the former ECU 
Securityholder  to  receive  the  Consideration  pursuant  to  the  Plan  of  Arrangement  shall  terminate  and  be  deemed  to  be 
surrendered and forfeited, for no consideration, to Golden.
No holder of ECU Securities shall be entitled to receive any consideration with respect to its ECU Securities other than the 
Consideration  in  accordance  with  the  Plan  of  Arrangement  and,  for  greater  certainty,  no  such  holder  will  be  entitled  to 
receive any interest, dividends, premium or other payment in connection therewith.
Withholding Rights
Golden, ECU and the Depositary, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any Consideration payable or 
otherwise deliverable to any former holder of ECU Securities such amounts as they may be required to deduct and withhold 
therefrom under any provision of applicable Laws in respect of applicable taxes.  Any such deducted and withheld amounts 
shall be treated as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.
No Fractional Securities
No fractional shares of Golden Stock, fractional Golden Replacement Options or fractional Golden Replacement Warrants 
shall be issued to any person pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement.  Instead, the number of shares of Golden Stock or the 
number of Golden Replacement Options or Golden Replacement Warrants to be issued to any person shall be rounded up 
or down, as applicable, to the nearest whole share of Golden Stock. In calculating such fractional interests, all ECU Shares, 
ECU Options or ECU Warrants, as applicable, registered in the name of or beneficially held by an ECU Securityholder or 
its nominee shall be aggregated.
Letters of Transmittal
In order to receive shares of Golden Stock and the cash payment for their ECU Shares or Golden Replacement Warrants for 
their ECU Warrants, as the case may be, Registered Shareholders or Registered Warrantholders must complete and sign the 
appropriate Letter of Transmittal included with this Circular (printed on blue paper in the case of ECU Share and printed on 
yellow paper in the case of ECU Warrants) and deliver it, together with certificates representing their ECU Shares or ECU 
Warrants and the other required documents, to the Depositary in accordance with the instructions contained in the Letters of 
Transmittal  included  with  this  Circular.  The  Letters  of  Transmittal  contains  procedural  information  relating  to  the
- 25 -
Please contact Kingsdale Shareholder Services Inc. at 1-877-659-1819
if you have any questions, or require assistance completing your Proxy.
Arrangement and should be reviewed carefully.  Copies of the Letters of Transmittal may be obtained by contacting the 
Depositary. The Letters of Transmittal will also be available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com under ECU’s profile.
ECU Shareholders  whose ECU Shares, or ECU Warrantholders  whose ECU Warrants,  are registered in the name of an 
Intermediary (such as a broker, investment dealer, bank, trust company, trustee or other intermediary) should contact that 
Intermediary for assistance in depositing their ECU Shares or ECU Warrants and should follow the instructions of such 
Intermediary in order to deposit their ECU Shares or ECU Warrants.
ECU Options
No  certificates  representing  ECU  Options  have  been  issued;  accordingly,  there  are  no  ECU  Option  certificates  to  be 
surrendered in connection with the Arrangement and ECU Optionholders do not need to complete a Letter of Transmittal 
with respect to their ECU Options.  The name of each ECU Optionholder shall be removed from the register of holders of 
ECU Options maintained by or on behalf of ECU as of the Effective Time and added to the register of holders maintained 
by or on behalf of Golden in respect of Golden Replacement Options as of the Effective Time in accordance with the steps 
of the Plan of Arrangement.  Golden will send each holder of Golden Replacement Options a notice confirming the details 
of such holder’s Golden Replacement Options following the Effective Date.
ECU Convertible Notes
The ECU Convertible Noteholder does not need to complete a Letter of Transmittal with respect to its ECU Convertible 
Notes.  Arrangements will be made by ECU and Golden following the Effective Date with respect to documentation related 
to the issuance of the ECU Replacement Notes.
Dissent Rights
Each  Registered  Shareholder  as  of  the  Record  Date  shall  be  entitled  to  exercise  Dissent  Rights  in  respect  of  the 
Arrangement  in  the  manner  set  out  in  Chapter  XIV  of  the  QBCA,  as  modified  by  the  Interim  Order  and  the  Plan  of 
Arrangement.  Any Registered Shareholder who exercises its Dissent Rights will be entitled to be paid by Golden the fair 
value of the ECU Shares held by such Dissenting Shareholder, as of the close of the offices of ECU on the day before the 
Arrangement Resolution is approved by the ECU Securityholders.  The Interim Order and the Plan of Arrangement provide 
that the fair value payable by Golden to a Dissenting Shareholder, may, at the option of Golden, be paid by way of issuance 
of shares of Golden Stock.  The Dissent Procedures must be strictly complied with in order for a Dissenting Shareholder to 
exercise Dissent  Rights, including that  such Dissenting Shareholder has exercised all of the  voting rights carried by  the 
ECU Shares held by such Dissenting Shareholder against the approval of the Arrangement Resolution.
To exercise the Dissent Right, a written Notice of Exercise of Dissent Rights must be received by ECU at its registered 
office at 1116 ave. Granada, Rouyn-Noranda, Québec J9Y1G9 not later than 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on August 26, 2011, 
or two Business Days prior to the time of the reconvening of any adjournment or postponement of the Meeting.
ECU Shareholders who beneficially own ECU Shares that are registered in the name of an Intermediary (such as a broker, 
investment dealer, bank, trust company or trustee or other intermediary) or in some other name and who wish to exercise 
Dissent Rights should be aware that only a Registered Shareholder as of the Record Date is entitled to exercise Dissent 
Rights.    A  Beneficial  Shareholder  who  wishes  to  exercise  Dissent  Rights  should  communicate  with  the  Beneficial 
Shareholder’s  Intermediary  as  to  the  procedure  for  instructing  them  to  exercise  the  Dissent  Rights  on  the  Beneficial 
Shareholder’s behalf.
For  greater  certainty,  no  ECU  Optionholder,  ECU  Warrantholder  or  ECU  Convertible  Noteholder  shall  be  entitled  to 
Dissent Rights in respect of such holder’s ECU Options, ECU Warrants or ECU Convertible Notes.  Additionally, the right 
of  a  Dissenting  Shareholder  to  have  its  ECU  Shares  repurchased  and  to  be  paid  the  fair  value  therefor  pursuant  to  the 
exercise of Dissent Rights is subject to the Arrangement becoming effective.
See “Rights of Dissenting Shareholders”.

Interests of Certain Persons in the Arrangement
In considering the recommendation of the ECU Board, ECU Securityholders should be aware that members of the ECU 
Board and the officers of ECU have interests in the Arrangement or may receive benefits that may differ from, or be in 
addition to, the interests of ECU Securityholders generally.
See “The Arrangement – Interests of Directors and Officers of ECU in the Arrangement”.
Certain Income Tax Considerations
ECU Shareholders, ECU Optionholders and ECU Warrantholders should consult their own tax advisors as to the 
Canadian  or  United  States  federal,  provincial,  state  and  local  tax  considerations  applicable  to  them  in  their 
particular circumstances.
Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations
For Canadian federal income tax purposes, an ECU Shareholder who is resident in Canada for purposes of the Tax Act, 
who  holds  ECU  Shares  as  capital  property  and  who  exchanges  such  ECU  Shares  for  Golden  Stock  and  cash  under  the 
Arrangement, will be considered to have disposed of the ECU Shares for proceeds of disposition equal to the aggregate of 
the  fair  market  value  at  the  Effective  Time  of  the  Golden  Stock  received  on  the  exchange  and  the  cash  consideration 
received on the exchange. Consequently, such ECU Shareholder should realize a capital gain (or a capital loss) to the extent 
that such proceeds of disposition exceed (or are less than) the aggregate of the ECU Shareholder’s adjusted cost base of the 
ECU Shares immediately before the exchange and any reasonable costs of disposition.
For Canadian federal income tax purposes, an ECU Optionholder who is resident in Canada for purposes of the Tax Act, 
who holds ECU Options as capital property, who acquired such ECU Options pursuant to the ECU Stock Option Plan by 
virtue of being an employee, officer or director of ECU and  who exchanges the ECU  Options  for Golden Replacement 
Options and no other consideration at the Effective Time, should not recognize any taxable income or loss as a result of 
such exchange pursuant to the Arrangement.
For Canadian federal income tax purposes, an ECU Warrantholder who is resident in Canada for purposes of the Tax Act, 
who holds ECU Warrants as  capital property and  who transfers such ECU Warrants to  Golden in exchange for Golden 
Replacement  Warrants  pursuant  to  the  Arrangement,  should  be  considered  to  have  disposed  of  such  ECU  Warrants  for 
proceeds of disposition equal to the  fair  market  value at the Effective Time of such Golden Replacement Warrants. An 
ECU Warrantholder should realize a capital gain (or capital loss) to the extent the proceeds of disposition of such ECU 
Warrants, net of any reasonable costs of disposition, exceed (or are less than) the adjusted cost base to such holder of such 
ECU Warrants immediately prior to the transfer.
For Canadian federal income tax purposes, an ECU Shareholder who is not resident in Canada for purposes of the Tax Act 
and  whose ECU  Shares are exchanged  for Golden Stock and cash  under the  Arrangement,  should not be subject to  tax 
under the Tax Act on any capital gain realized on such exchange unless the ECU Shares are “taxable Canadian property” 
(as defined in the Tax Act) to the ECU Shareholder at the Effective Time and the ECU Shares are not “treaty-protected 
property” (as defined in the Tax Act) of such ECU Shareholder at the time of the exchange.
For Canadian federal income tax purposes, an ECU Optionholder who is not resident in Canada for purposes of the Tax 
Act, who acquired ECU Options pursuant to the ECU Stock Option Plan by virtue of employment with ECU in Canada and 
who  exchanges  such  ECU  Options  for  Golden  Replacement  Options  and  no  other  consideration  at  the  Effective  Time, 
should not recognize any taxable income or loss as a result of such exchange pursuant to the Arrangement.
For Canadian federal income tax purposes, an ECU Warrantholder who is not resident in Canada for purposes of the Tax 
Act and who transfers ECU Warrants to Golden for Golden Replacement Warrants pursuant to the Arrangement, should not 
be subject to income tax under the Tax Act in respect of any capital gain realized by such holder on such transfer at the 
Effective Time unless such ECU Warrants are “taxable Canadian property” (as defined in the Tax Act) to such holder at the 
time  of  the  transfer  and  the  ECU  Warrants  are  not  “treaty-protected  property”  (as  defined  in  Tax  Act)  of  such  ECU 
Warrantholder at the time of disposition.

The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed summary of the principal Canadian federal income 
tax considerations under the Tax Act relating to the Arrangement set forth in this Circular under “Certain Canadian Federal 
Income Tax Considerations”.
United States Federal Income Tax Considerations
The exchange of ECU Shares for Golden  Stock and cash, and the exchange of ECU  Warrants for Golden  Replacement 
Warrants, pursuant to the Arrangement is intended to be treated as a taxable exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
Each U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between (a) the sum of the (i) U.S. dollar equivalent of 
the Canadian dollars received calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt and (ii) the fair 
market value of the Golden Stock or Golden Replacement Warrants and (b) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its ECU 
Shares or ECU Warrants disposed of pursuant to the Arrangement.
ECU believes, and the discussion herein assumes, that it may be and may have been a passive foreign investment company 
in one or more years since its formation.
Under  the  tax  rules  for  PFICs,  any  gain  recognized  by  a  U.S.  Holder  who  disposes  of  ECU  Shares  or  ECU  Warrants 
pursuant to the Arrangement, and whose holding period for the ECU Shares or ECU Warrants includes any period during 
which ECU  was a PFIC,  will be allocated ratably to each day of the U.S. Holder’s holding period  with respect to such 
shares or warrants. Gain allocated to the year of disposition and to years before ECU became a PFIC will be treated as 
arising in the year of disposition and taxed at ordinary U.S. federal income tax rates. Gain allocated to each of the other 
years during which ECU was a PFIC will be taxed at the highest ordinary U.S. federal income tax rate in effect for each of 
those years, and interest will be added to the tax determined for each of those years.  Any gain recognized by a U.S. Holder 
whose holding period for the ECU Shares or ECU Warrants does not include any period during which ECU was a PFIC 
will be a capital gain, and a long-term capital gain if the U.S. Holder’s holding period with respect to its ECU Shares or 
ECU Warrants (as applicable) is more than one year at the time of the Arrangement.   Any loss recognized by a U.S. Holder 
will  generally  be  treated  as  capital  loss,  which  will  be  long-term  capital  loss  if  the  U.S.  Holder’s  holding  period  with 
respect to its ECU Shares or ECU Warrants is more than one year at the time of the Arrangement. The deductibility of 
capital loss is subject to limitations.
U.S. Holders that have made a valid “mark-to-market” election with respect to ECU Shares will be subject to rules different 
from the rules applicable to shareholders of PFICs described above.
Distributions  with  respect  to  Golden  Stock  will  be  treated  as  dividends  when  paid  to  the  extent  of  Golden’s  current  or 
accumulated earnings and profits as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Generally, distributions treated as 
dividends paid to a Non-U.S. Holder with respect to Golden Stock will be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax, or such 
lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty.
A holder of Golden Replacement Warrants received in the exchange generally will not recognize gain or loss upon the cash 
exercise of a Golden Replacement Warrant.  A holder’s basis in the Golden Stock received upon the exercise of a Golden 
Replacement Warrant will equal the sum of the holder’s tax basis in the warrant plus the cash paid to exercise the warrant.  
Upon the sale or exchange of a Golden Replacement Warrant, U.S. Holders will generally recognize gain or loss equal to 
the difference between the amount realized on such sale or exchange and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Golden 
Replacement Warrant.
A Non-U.S. Holder of Golden Stock or Golden Replacement Warrants generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income 
tax (or any withholding thereof) with respect to gain recognized on a sale or other disposition of Golden Stock or Golden 
Replacement Warrants unless (i) the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of the Non-U.S. Holder in the 
U.S. and, in cases in which certain tax treaties apply, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment or fixed base of the 
Non-U.S. Holder (collectively, “effectively connected gain”); or (ii) the Non-U.S. Holder is a non-resident alien individual 
who is present in the U.S. for 183 or more days during the taxable year of disposition and meets certain other requirements.
The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed summary of the anticipated U.S. federal income tax 
consequences resulting from the Arrangement set forth in this Circular under “Certain United States Federal Income Tax 
Considerations”.

Securities Laws Information for Canadian ECU Securityholders
The issue of Golden Stock, Golden Replacement Options, Golden Replacements Warrants and ECU Replacement Notes 
pursuant  to  the  Arrangement,  including  the  issue  of  Golden  Stock  on  the  exercise  of  Golden  Replacement  Options  and 
Golden  Replacement  Warrants,  will  constitute  distributions  of  securities  which  are  exempt  from  the  prospectus 
requirements of the Canadian Securities Laws. The Golden Stock, Golden Replacement Options and Golden Replacement 
Warrants  issued  pursuant  to  the  Arrangement,  including  the  Golden  Stock  issuable  upon  the  exercise  of  the  Golden 
Replacement Options and Golden Replacement Warrants, may be resold in any province or territory of Canada, provided: 
(i) that Golden is a reporting issuer in a jurisdiction of Canada for the four months immediately preceding the trade; (ii) the 
trade is not a “control distribution” as defined in NI 45-102, (iii) no unusual effort is made to prepare the market or create a 
demand for those securities, (iv) no extraordinary commission or consideration is paid in respect of that sale, and (v) if the 
selling security holder is an insider or officer of Golden, the insider or officer has no reasonable grounds to believe that 
Golden is in default of securities legislation (within the meaning of NI 45-102).  Following the closing of the Arrangement, 
Golden  will  apply  to  the  applicable  Canadian  Securities  Authorities  to  have  ECU  cease  to  be  a  reporting  issuer; 
accordingly,  the  ECU  Replacement  Notes  may  not  be  resold  within  Canada  except  pursuant  to  an  exemption  from  the 
prospectus requirements of applicable Canadian Securities Laws.
See “Securities Laws Considerations – Canadian Securities Laws”.
Securities Laws Information for United States ECU Securityholders
The issue of Golden Stock, Golden Replacement Options and Golden Replacements Warrants pursuant to the Arrangement 
will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any state of the United States and will be issued 
in  reliance  on  the  Section  3(a)(10)  Exemption.  Persons  who  are  not  “affiliates”  of  Golden  after  completion  of  the 
Arrangement may sell the Golden Securities that they receive in connection with the Arrangement without restriction under 
the U.S. Securities Act.  The ECU Replacement Notes have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act, and are being 
issued in reliance on the exemption from registration set forth in Section 3(a)(9) thereof. Such ECU Replacement Notes 
will bear the same legend restricting transfer as the ECU Convertible Notes currently contain.
See “Securities Laws Considerations – U.S. Securities Laws”.

time  up  to  and  including  5:00  p.m.  (Eastern  Time)  on  the  last  Business  Day  preceding  the  day  of  the  Meeting  or  the 
reconvening of any adjournment or postponement of it or to the chair of the Meeting on the day of the Meeting or  the 
reconvening of any adjournment or postponement of it prior to a vote being held in respect of the Arrangement Resolution.  
Only  Registered  Securityholders  of  ECU  have  the  right  to  revoke  a  proxy.    Non-Registered  Securityholders  who 
wish to change their vote must arrange for their respective intermediaries to revoke the proxy on their behalf in 
accordance with any requirements of the Intermediaries.
Proxy Voting
All ECU Securities represented at the Meeting by properly completed and executed proxies will be voted on any ballot that 
may be called for and, where a choice with respect to any matter to be acted upon has been specified in the proxy, ECU 
Securities  represented  by  the  proxy  will  be  voted  in  accordance  with  such  instructions.  Registered  holders  of  ECU 
Securities will also be able to vote by calling a toll-free number or by using the internet, as provided for in the forms of 
proxy. In the absence of any such instruction, the persons whose names appear on the applicable printed forms of 
proxy will vote in favour of all the matters set out thereon. If any other business or amendments or variations to 
matters  identified  in  the  Notice  of  Special  Meeting  of  Securityholders  properly  come  before  the  Meeting,  then 
discretionary authority is conferred upon the persons appointed in the proxy to vote in the manner they see fit.
Advice to Beneficial Securityholders of ECU Securities
The information set forth in this section is of significant importance to many ECU Securityholders, as a number of ECU 
Shareholders  and  ECU  Warrantholders  do  not  hold  ECU  Shares  or  ECU  Warrants,  as  applicable,  in  their  own  names. 
Beneficial  Securityholders  of  ECU  who  do  not  hold  ECU  Securities  in  their  own  names  should  note  that  only  proxies 
deposited  by  Registered  Securityholders  whose  names  appear  on  the  records  of  ECU  as  the  registered  holders  of  ECU 
Securities can be recognized and acted upon at the Meeting. If ECU Securities are listed in an account statement provided 
to an ECU Securityholder by an Intermediary (such as a broker, investment dealer, bank, trust company, trustee or other 
intermediary), then in almost all cases those ECU Securities will not be registered in the ECU Securityholder’s name on the 
records  of  ECU.    Such  ECU  Securities  will  more  likely  be  registered  under  the  name  of  the  ECU  Securityholder’s 
Intermediary or an agent of the Intermediary. In Canada, the majority of such ECU Shares and ECU Warrants are registered 
under  the  name  of  CDS  &  Co.  (the  registration  name  for  CDS  Clearing  and  Depository  Services  Inc.,  which  acts  as 
nominee for many Canadian brokerage firms and other such Intermediaries). ECU Securities held by Intermediaries or their 
agents or nominees can only be voted (for or against resolutions) upon the instructions of the Beneficial Securityholder. 
Without specific instructions, Intermediaries and their agents and nominees are prohibited from voting ECU Securities for 
their clients. The directors and officers of ECU do not know for whose benefit the ECU Securities registered in the name of 
CDS & Co., or of other Intermediaries, are held. Therefore, Beneficial Securityholders should ensure that instructions 
respecting the voting of their ECU Securities are communicated to the appropriate person.
Applicable regulatory policy requires Intermediaries to seek voting instructions from Beneficial Securityholders in advance 
of  ECU  Securityholders’  meetings.  Every  Intermediary  has  its  own  mailing  procedures  and  provides  its  own  return 
instructions to clients, which should be carefully followed by Beneficial Securityholders in order to ensure that their ECU 
Securities are voted at the Meeting. The form of proxy supplied to a Beneficial Securityholder by its Intermediary (or the
- 49 -

if you have any questions, or require assistance completing your Proxy.
agent of the Intermediary) is similar to the form of proxy provided to Registered Securityholders. However, its purpose is 
limited  to  instructing  the  Registered  Securityholder  (the  Intermediary  or  the  agent  of  the  Intermediary)  how  to  vote  on 
behalf  of  the  Beneficial  Securityholder.  The  majority  of  Intermediaries  now  delegate  responsibility  for  obtaining 
instructions from clients to Broadridge. Broadridge typically mails a scannable voting instruction form instead of the form 
of proxy. The Beneficial Securityholder is asked to complete the voting instruction form and return it to Broadridge by mail 
or facsimile. Alternatively, the Beneficial Securityholder may call a toll-free number or use the internet to vote the ECU 
Securities  held  by  the  Beneficial  Securityholder.  Broadridge  then  tabulates  the  results  of  all  instructions  received  and 
provides  appropriate  instructions  respecting  the  voting  of  ECU  Shares  to  be  represented  at  the  applicable  meeting.  A 
Beneficial Securityholder receiving a voting instruction form cannot use that voting instruction form to vote ECU 
Securities directly at the Meeting as the voting instruction form must be returned as directed by Broadridge well in 
advance of the Meeting in order to have the ECU Securities voted.
Although  a  Beneficial  Securityholder  may  not  be  recognized  directly  at  the  Meeting  for  the  purposes  of  voting  ECU 
Securities registered in the name of its Intermediary (or agent of the Intermediary), a Beneficial Securityholder may attend 
the  Meeting  as  proxyholder  for  the  Registered  Shareholder  and  vote  the  ECU  Securities  in  that  capacity.  Beneficial 
Securityholders who wish to attend the Meeting and indirectly vote their ECU Securities as proxyholders for Registered 
Securityholders should enter their own names in the blank spaces on the instruments of proxy provided to them and return 
the  same  to  their  Intermediary  (or  the  agent  of  the  Intermediary)  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  provided  by  such 
Intermediary (or agent), well in advance of the Meeting.

Arrangement.  See “Rights of Dissenting Shareholders” for details regarding such Dissent Rights.
Background to the Arrangement
THE ARRANGEMENT
The Arrangement is the result of arm’s length negotiations conducted between representatives of ECU and Golden, and 
their respective legal and financial advisors.  The following is a summary of the background to the Arrangement.
On September 29, 2010, as part of its ongoing strategic planning process, ECU began to work with the Financial Advisor, 
which advised ECU in connection with potential strategic alternatives, including a range of potential transactions with a 
number of possible counterparties that would be identified by the Financial Advisor and agreed to by ECU.
!
!
!
!
!
!
!
The range of potential counterparties considered by ECU included both strategic and financial parties. Potential 
counterparties  were  identified  on  the  basis  of  their  ability  to  provide  ECU  with,  among  other  things,  enhanced 
liquidity  and  complementary  operational  competencies  including  mine  development  expertise.    In  addition, 
targeted strategic counterparties generally possessed an attractive, growth-oriented asset portfolio.
Over  the  months  that  followed,  ECU  met  with  a  number  of  potential  counterparties,  some  of  whom  executed 
confidentiality agreements and conducted various levels of due diligence, including site visits.
Based on Golden’s asset portfolio, balance sheet strength and management expertise, the Financial Advisor had 
identified Golden as a potential counterparty to a transaction with ECU.
On January 11, 2011, the Financial Advisor met in New York City with Golden, for which it had previously acted 
as an underwriter in connection with a public financing completed in March 2010, to discuss a range of issues, 
including  a  potential  strategic  investment  by  Golden  in  ECU  or  a  business  combination  between  the  two 
companies.
Subsequent to the January 2011 meeting with Golden, and in response to Golden’s request, the Financial Advisor 
provided Golden with certain publicly available information regarding ECU.
On  March  8,  2011,  at  the  Prospectors  and  Developers  Association  of  Canada  annual  conference  in  Toronto, 
representatives of the Financial Advisor had an additional informal discussion regarding ECU with a member of 
Golden’s management.
On April 4, 2011, Golden requested the Financial Advisor to arrange an introductory meeting with ECU.

On April 13, 2011, representatives of ECU, Golden and the Financial Advisor held an introductory meeting at the 
European  Gold  Forum  in  Zurich,  Switzerland.    Stephen  J.  Altmann,  President  of  ECU,  Jeffrey  Clevenger, 
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Golden, and Jerry Danni, Executive Vice President of Golden, 
were in attendance. At this meeting, Messrs. Clevenger, Danni and Altmann provided general overviews of their 
companies based solely on publicly available information.  They discussed the possibility of a strategic business 
combination and whether each party was interested in pursuing further discussions.  Messrs. Clevenger, Danni and 
Altmann  concluded  the  meeting  with  an  agreement  to  continue  preliminary  discussions  and  to  enter  into  a 
confidentiality agreement in respect of the planned discussions.
Following the meeting in Zurich, Switzerland, Golden’s management and ECU’s management negotiated a mutual 
confidentiality agreement, which was executed on April 21, 2011.  The confidentiality agreement included a two 
year “standstill” agreement under which each of Golden and ECU agreed not to propose a takeover or business 
combination  transaction  to  the  other  or  its  shareholders  without  the  consent  of  the  other’s  board  of  directors.  
During this period, Mr. Clevenger and Mr. Altmann spoke by telephone and communicated by e-mail regarding 
the  coordination  of  initial  due  diligence  activities,  including  travel  to  ECU’s  Velardeña  District  Properties  in 
Mexico and Golden’s El Quevar Project in Argentina.
On April 27, 28 and 29, 2011, David Drips, Golden’s Project Director, Argentina, and Robert Blakestad, Senior 
Vice  President  and  Chief  Geologist  of  Golden,  conducted  on-site  due  diligence  at  ECU’s  Velardeña  District 
Properties and processing facilities. A representative of the Financial Advisor was also present.
On May 2, 2011, Golden was given electronic access to additional ECU technical data and corporate information.
On  May  10,  11  and  12,  2011,  Messrs.  Clevenger  and  Drips  conducted  additional  on-site  due  diligence  of  the 
Velardeña  District  Properties,  including  the  mines  and  processing  facilities.  In  addition,  on  May  11,  2011, 
Mr. Clevenger,  Mr. Altmann  and  Michel  Roy,  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  ECU,  discussed  their 
views  regarding  the  potential  strategic  and  financial  benefits  of  a  business  combination  transaction  between 
Golden and ECU.  They agreed that a combined company would be stronger and better capitalized, and  would 
have better access to capital markets as a result of increased size and the combination of current silver and other 
metals production in Mexico, the El Quevar Project in Argentina, advanced exploration projects in Mexico and 
Peru,  and  a  pipeline  of  advanced  and  reconnaissance  exploration  projects.    They  agreed  that  ECU’s  producing 
operations in Mexico would benefit from the operations expertise and experience of Golden’s management, and 
that Golden’s exploration efforts would benefit from the participation of ECU management.  They also discussed 
the roles their respective management teams might have in the combined company, including the likelihood that 
Mr. Roy would serve as a consultant to the combined entity, and the potential for one of ECU’s directors to serve 
on the board of directors of the combined company.  They agreed that a business combination between the two 
companies  was  a  mutually  desirable  prospect  as  an  at-market  merger  of  equals,  although  no  specific  exchange 
ratio  was  discussed  at  that  time.    They  also  discussed  the  possibility  of  Golden  providing  financing  to  ECU 
pending completion of an agreed business combination transaction.  They agreed that Mr. Roy and members of his 
management would conduct a due diligence trip to Golden’s El Quevar Project during the week of May 23, 2011.  
They  further  agreed  that  it  would  be  desirable  for  the  two  companies  to  enter  into  an  exclusivity  agreement, 
pursuant to which they would agree to continue discussions and negotiations regarding a business combination, 
and not to hold such discussions with other parties, until June 30, 2011.
On  May  20,  2011,  ECU  received  a  non-binding  letter  of  intent  (the  “LOI”)  and  form  of  binding  exclusivity 
agreement (the “Exclusivity Agreement”) from Golden.  During the week of May 23, 2011, the parties and their 
legal and financial advisors discussed the structure of a potential transaction and negotiated the terms of the LOI 
and the Exclusivity Agreement.
On May 23, 24 and 25, 2011, ECU’s geological team, including Mr. Roy, Mr. Joaquin Rodriguez, Vice President 
of Exploration, and Mr. Jorge Lujan, Mine Manager, and  a representative of the Financial Advisor travelled to 
Argentina to conduct on-site due diligence on Golden’s asset, El Quevar.

On May 25, 2011, the ECU Board held a meeting to discuss the Golden proposal.  The Financial  Advisor and 
ECU’s  legal  counsel,  Blakes,  provided  the  ECU  Board  with  a  detailed  overview  of  the  key  terms  and 
considerations  of  the  LOI  and  the  Exclusivity  Agreement.    After  a  thorough  discussion  of  the  merits  and 
considerations of the proposed transaction, the ECU Board authorized Mr. Altmann to negotiate the terms of the 
LOI and the Exclusivity Agreement.
Mr. Altmann, along with the Financial Advisor and Blakes, negotiated the terms of the LOI and the Exclusivity 
Agreement for several days following the ECU Board meeting.
On May 31, 2011, ECU and Golden each executed the LOI and the Exclusivity Agreement pursuant to which the 
Parties agreed not to pursue a business combination transaction with any other party until June 30, 2011. The LOI 
did not provide for an agreed upon exchange ratio.
Following  the  execution  of  the  LOI  and  until  the  execution  of  the  Arrangement  Agreement,  representatives  of 
ECU  and  Golden  continued  their  due  diligence  investigations  and  interacted  regularly  as  the  Parties  sought  to 
reach agreement on the material terms of the Arrangement and the Private Placement and to draft the definitive 
documentation.
ECU continued to have intermittent conversations with a third party pursuant to the carve-out provisions of the 
Exclusivity Agreement. The third party was a partnership between a large private mining company and a private 
equity firm, both based in Europe. Discussions focused on a transaction whereby the third party would acquire a 
50% stake in the Velardeña Property and Chicago Property in exchange for an equity investment in ECU and a 
commitment  by  the  third  party  to  fund  development  and  construction  of  a  new  production  facility,  with  ECU 
retaining the remaining 50% stake in the form of a carried interest. The third party had conducted preliminary site 
due diligence; however, no confidentiality agreement had yet been signed. These discussions did not ultimately 
lead to the entering into of any agreements, whether binding or non-binding, between the parties.
Beginning on June 7, 2011, Golden sent additional personnel to conduct follow-up due diligence on the Velardeña 
District Properties and related processing facilities. Representatives of Sentient, which is a major shareholder of 
Golden and has a representative on the Golden Board, also visited the properties and facilities.
During the week of June 6, 2011, ECU and Golden each provided the other and their respective legal and financial 
advisors with access to an electronic data room containing non-public information responsive to the due diligence 
requests each had previously submitted to the other.  Golden, ECU and their respective legal and financial advisors 
conducted  due  diligence  reviews  of  materials  provided  until  the  date  definitive  transaction  agreements  were 
signed.
On  June  7,  2011,  Mr.  Altmann  met  with  Mr.  Clevinger  and  Mr.  W.  Durand  Eppler,  a  Director  of  Golden,  in 
Golden’s  offices  in  Golden,  Colorado  and  discussed  certain  management  issues  related  to  the  Combined 
Company, additional deal terms and mechanics.
ECU initially contacted the Fairness Advisor on June 9, 2011, and on June 10, 2011, ECU engaged the Fairness 
Advisor to prepare and, when required, provide an opinion as to the fairness to ECU Shareholders, from a financial 
point of view, of any transaction consideration in a contemplated transaction between Golden and ECU.
On June 10, 2011, Mr. Rodriguez of ECU travelled to Golden’s Zacatecas Project in Mexico to conduct additional 
detailed due diligence.  Each of ECU and Golden continued to conduct detailed technical, financial and legal due 
diligence during the weeks beginning June 13, 2011, and June 20, 2011.
Golden delivered the initial draft of the Arrangement Agreement to ECU on June 13, 2011.  From then until June 
24,  2011,  the  Parties,  their  legal  counsel    and  their  financial  advisors  negotiated  the  terms  of  the  arrangement 
agreement  and  related  documents,  including  a  term  sheet  for  a  convertible  debt  financing  contemplated  to  be 
provided by Golden to ECU, and exchanged drafts of the arrangement agreement and related documents.  During 
this period, Mr. Clevenger also discussed with Mr. Altmann and with members of the compensation committee of

the Golden Board regarding the terms on which Mr. Altmann would serve as President of the Combined Company, 
if a strategic combination were completed.
On June 13, 2011, the trading volume of the ECU Shares on the TSX was approximately 3.4 million shares and the 
share  price  closed  approximately  18%  over  the  June  10,  2011  closing  share  price.  The  TSX  contacted  Mr. 
Altmann regarding increased trading activity in the ECU Shares and, in response to questions, Mr. Altmann and a 
representative  of  Blakes  reported  that  ECU  was  in  discussions  with  Golden  regarding  a  potential  business 
combination transaction, but that no definitive agreements had been entered into and no exchange ratio had been 
agreed upon.
On the evening of June 21, 2011, the ECU Board held a meeting to discuss developments related to the proposed 
Arrangement and Private Placement. Representatives of the Financial Advisor and Blakes provided an update on 
the status of the proposed transaction, outstanding issues and key considerations.
On June 22, 2011, Messrs. Roy and Clevenger met in Denver, Colorado to discuss certain management matters 
relating to the Combined Company.
Over the evening of June 22, 2011 and through June 23, 2011, Mr. Clevenger and Mr. Altmann negotiated the 
final  terms  of  the  Arrangement  Agreement,  including  the  0.05  exchange  ratio,  and  Golden  and  ECU  and  their 
respective legal counsel and financial advisors worked to finalize the Arrangement Agreement, the terms of the 
Private Placement and related agreements.
On  the  evening  of  June  23,  2011,  the  Golden  Board  held  a  meeting  at  which  it  approved  the  proposed 
Arrangement and the Private Placement.
On the evening of June 23, 2011, the ECU Board convened a meeting to consider the proposed Arrangement and 
Private  Placement.  The  ECU  Board  was  joined  by  representatives  of  Blakes,  the  Financial  Advisor  and  the 
Fairness  Advisor.  At  this  meeting,  Mr.  Altmann  informed  the  ECU  Board  that  he  expected  the  Golden  Board 
would approve an exchange ratio of 0.05. On the basis of such exchange ratio, the Fairness Advisor provided its 
verbal  opinion  to  the  ECU  Board  that,  as  of  such  date,  and  subject  to  certain  assumptions,  limitations  and 
qualifications, the Arrangement is fair, from a financial point of view, to ECU Shareholders (other than Golden 
and its affiliates). The Fairness Advisor confirmed that it would provide its written Fairness Opinion soon after the 
Arrangement Agreement was executed. The terms of the Arrangement Agreement and the Subscription Agreement 
were thoroughly discussed among the ECU directors, the Financial Advisor and Blakes.
With  all  remaining  transaction  issues  having  been  settled  through  the  night,  the  ECU  Board  reconvened  its 
meeting early on the  morning of June 24, 2011, and unanimously approved the proposed Arrangement and the 
Private Placement.
ECU  and  Golden  executed  the  Arrangement  Agreement  and  the  Subscription  Agreement  shortly  thereafter  and 
announced the Arrangement at approximately 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Time).

Recommendation of the ECU Board
ECU retained the Financial Advisor to act as its financial advisor and retained the Fairness Advisor to prepare the Fairness 
Opinion.  The Fairness Advisor has given an opinion, as of June 23, 2011, and based upon and subject to the scope of the 
review,  analysis  undertaken  and  various  assumptions,  limitations  and  qualifications  set  forth  in  its  opinion,  that  the 
Consideration to be paid by Golden to holders of ECU Shares (other than Golden and its affiliates) pursuant to the terms of 
the Arrangement is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of ECU Shares (other than Golden and its affiliates). 
The ECU Board, having taken into account such opinion of the Fairness Advisor and such other matters as it considered 
relevant,  has  unanimously  determined that  the  Arrangement  is  in  the  best  interest  of  ECU  and  is  fair  to  the  ECU 
Securityholders  from  a  financial  point  of  view.    Accordingly,  the  ECU  Board  unanimously  recommends  that  ECU 
Securityholders  (other  than  Golden  and  its  affiliates  for  which  no  recommendation  is  given)  vote  FOR  the 
Arrangement Resolution.

Reasons for the Arrangement
In  the  course  of  their  evaluation  of  the  Arrangement,  the  ECU  Board  consulted  with  ECU’s  senior  management,  legal
counsel, the Financial Advisor and the Fairness Advisor, reviewed a significant amount of information and considered a 
number of factors which show compelling business reasons for the Arrangement, including, among others, the following:
!
!
!
!
!
Review  of  Strategic  Alternatives.  The  Arrangement  was  arrived  at  following  an  extensive  review  of  strategic 
alternatives which was conducted with the assistance of the Financial Advisor, including considering a range of 
potential transactions with a number of possible counterparties identified by the Financial Advisor and agreed to 
by ECU.
The Arrangement creates a combined company with greater scale and financial strength and an enhanced capital 
markets profile:
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
the Combined Company is expected to have sufficient cash to advance expansion plans at the Velardeña 
District Properties and the continued development of the El Quevar Project; 
the  Combined  Company’s  basic  market  capitalization  will  be  over  US$600  million,  based  upon  the 
closing  trading  prices of  ECU  and  Golden  as  at  June  23,  2011,  with  an  expected  increased  liquidity 
profile on both the NYSE Amex and the TSX; and
the Combined Company’s increased scale is expected to improve access to global capital markets to assist 
future growth efforts.
The Arrangement combines complementary management teams with proven track records of success to enhance 
and expand the existing portfolio of combined assets:
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
Golden’s  management  team  has  strong  expertise  and  a  proven  track  record  in  mine  building  and 
operations,  which  can  be  leveraged  in  order  to  seek  to  optimize  and  potentially  expand  the  Velardeña 
District Properties mining operations;
ECU has an operations team totalling nearly 500 people that can operate mines and mills in Mexico as 
required by the planning team;
ECU’s exploration expertise is expected to further enhance exploration efforts at the El Quevar Project, 
the Zacatecas Project and other drill testing projects across South America; and
the Combined Company will have a large portfolio of projects which, combined with enhanced scale and 
broader reach, will create opportunities for growth in existing and new jurisdictions.
The Arrangement increases leverage to precious metals with significant base metals credits:
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
the Combined Company will have combined measured mineral resources and indicated mineral resources 
of approximately 25 million ounces silver, 0.3 million ounces gold, 26 million pounds lead and 37 million 
pounds zinc;
the  Combined  Company  will  have  combined  inferred  mineral  resources  of  approximately  187  million 
ounces silver, 2 million ounces gold, 1 billion pounds lead and 1 billion pounds zinc; and
the Combined Company will have opportunities to expand its current resource base in Mexico, Argentina 
and Peru.
The  Arrangement  creates  a  new  leading  junior  silver  mining  company  with  an  attractive  portfolio  of  assets 
consisting of:
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
the silver, gold and base metals mining operations in the Velardeña Mining District;
the advanced exploration-stage El Quevar Project in the Salta Province, Argentina;
the advanced exploration-stage Zacatecas Project in Zacatecas, Mexico;
a number of drill testing projects in Peru (Cochabamba, Jehuamarca), Mexico (La Pinta) and Argentina 
(Atlas); and
a large portfolio of approximately 40 exploration properties in the reconnaissance/target delineation stage 
located primarily in South America.

Continued Participation by ECU Shareholders in Velardeña District Properties.  ECU Shareholders, through their 
ownership  of  Golden  Stock,  will  continue  to  participate  in  any  value  increases  associated  with  the  Velardeña 
District Properties.
Increased Portfolio of Silver Assets.  The Arrangement continues the strategy to which ECU Securityholders are 
currently exposed of building a portfolio of quality silver assets in low political risk jurisdictions.
Exchange Ratio.  The following is a discussion of the Exchange Ratio in relation to trading prices of ECU Shares 
and Golden Stock on the Canadian Market and trading prices of Golden Stock on the TSX and on the U.S. Market. 
Whereas the Exchange Ratio represents a discount of 7% based on the closing trading prices of the ECU Shares 
and Golden Stock on the TSX on June 23, 2011, the last trading day prior to the date of announcement of the 
proposed Arrangement (6% if based on the closing trading prices of Golden Stock in the U.S. Market and the ECU 
Shares in the Canadian Market on such date), based on the VWAP for the 20 trading days ended June 23, 2011 in 
each case as indicated below, the Exchange Ratio represents a modest premium or an “at-market” transaction:
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
the Exchange Ratio represents a premium of approximately 7% to the VWAP of the ECU Shares in the 
Canadian Market based on the June 23, 2011 closing trading price of Golden Stock in the U.S. Market 
(where most of Golden Stock trades);
the Exchange Ratio represents a premium of approximately 4% to the VWAP of the ECU Shares on the 
TSX based on the June 23, 2011 closing trading price of Golden Stock on the TSX; and
the Exchange Ratio represents an “at-market” transaction based on the VWAP of the ECU Shares in the 
Canadian Market and the VWAP of Golden Stock on the U.S. Market (or a 2% discount to the VWAP of 
the ECU Shares on the TSX, based on the VWAP of Golden Stock on the TSX).
The  Financial  Advisor  and  the  Fairness  Advisor.  The  ECU  Board  considered  the  financial  presentations  and 
advice of the Financial Advisor, as well as the Fairness Opinion of the Fairness Advisor delivered orally to the 
ECU Board on June 23, 2011, and subsequently confirmed in writing as of such date, as to the fairness, from a 
financial  point  of  view,  of  the  Consideration  to  be  received  by  ECU  Shareholders,  other  than  Golden  and  its 
affiliates, under the Arrangement.  The written Fairness Opinion is attached as Appendix D to this Circular.
Alternatives to the Arrangement.  The ECU Board will remain able to respond, in accordance with its fiduciary 
duties, to bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposals that are more favourable to ECU Shareholders than 
the Arrangement and constitute Superior Proposals under the Arrangment Agreement.  Under such circumstances, 
subject to payment of the ECU Termination Fee in the amount of Cdn$10 million, ECU may, in accordance with 
the  Arrangement  Agreement,  terminate  the  Arrangement  Agreement  and  approve  and  recommend  any  such 
Superior Proposal if Golden does not exercise its right to match such Superior Proposal in accordance with the 
Arrangement Agreement. The Golden Board has the same rights under the Arrangment Agreement, and Golden 
would be subject to payment of the Golden Termination Fee in the amount of Cdn$10 million if the Golden Board
wished  to  terminate  the  Arrangement  Agreement  and  approve  and  recommend  any  Superior  Proposal  made  to 
Golden if ECU does not exercise its right to match such Superior Proposal in accordance with the Arrangement 
Agreement.
Intervening Events.  The ECU Board will also remain able to respond, in accordance with its fiduciary duties, to 
the  occurrence  of  any  Intervening  Event.  Under  such  circumstances,  ECU  may,  in  accordance  with  the 
Arrangement  Agreement,  change  its  recommendation  in  favour  of  the  approval  of  the  Arrangement  Resolution 
(subject to payment of the ECU Termination Fee if Golden elects to terminate the Arrangement Agreement as a 
result  of  such  change  of  recommendation)  if  Golden  does  not  exercise  its  right  to  respond  to  such  Intervening 
Event to the satisfaction of the ECU Board in accordance with the Arrangement Agreement.  The Golden Board 
will also be able to similary respond to any Intervening Event.
Termination Fee Reasonable. The ECU Board believes that the ECU Termination Fee payable to Golden in certain 
circumstances is reasonable and not preclusive of other proposals.

Voting Agreement. The directors and officers of ECU (being the ECU Locked-Up Securityholders), who in total 
held approximately 1.5% of the outstanding ECU Shares, approximately 87.9% of the outstanding ECU Options, 
none of the outstanding February 2009 Warrants and none of the outstanding December 2009 Warrants as at June 
24, 2011, entered into the Voting Agreement with Golden pursuant to which they agreed, among other things, to 
vote in favour of the Arrangement Resolution.
Required Securityholder and Court Approvals. The ECU Board considered the following rights and approvals to 
protect ECU Securityholders:
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
the Arrangement Resolution must be approved at the Meeting by: (a) at least 66 2/3% of the votes cast by 
ECU Shareholders; (b) at least 66 2/3% of the votes cast by all ECU Securityholders, voting together as a 
single class; and (c) a simple majority of the votes cast by ECU Shareholders after excluding the votes 
cast in respect of ECU Shares beneficially owned or over which control or direction is exercised by Mr. 
Michel Roy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ECU, and Mr. Stephen J. Altmann, President of 
ECU, and by their respective related parties or joint actors;
the Arrangement must be approved by the Court, which will consider, among other things, the fairness of 
the Arrangement to ECU Securityholders; and 
ECU Shareholders are entitled to exercise Dissent Rights in respect of the Arrangement.
Reasonable  Terms  of  the  Arrangement  Agreement.  The  terms  and  conditions  of  the  Arrangement  Agreement, 
including ECU’s and Golden’s representations,  warranties and covenants, and the conditions to their respective 
obligations are, in the judgment of ECU, after consultation with its legal counsel, reasonable.
Likelihood of Completion. It is likely that the conditions to complete the Arrangement will be satisfied, including 
taking into account the nature of the approvals required by both ECU and Golden to be obtained as a condition to 
completing the Arrangement.
No Material Regulatory Issues. There are no material competition or other regulatory issues which are expected to 
arise in connection with the Arrangement so as to prevent its completion, and all required regulatory clearances 
and approvals are expected to be obtained.
Free to Support Superior Proposal. If a Superior Proposal is made to ECU Shareholders, ECU Securityholders 
other than the ECU Locked-Up Securityholders, are free to support such Superior Proposal and vote against the 
Arrangement Resolution. In the event that the Arrangement Agreement is terminated by ECU or Golden to enable 
ECU to enter into an acquisition agreement  with a third party that  has  made a Superior Proposal and the ECU 
Termination Fee is paid, then the Voting Agreement to which the ECU Locked-Up Securityholders are party will 
also terminate and such securityholders will also be free to support such Superior Proposal.
Free  to  Support  Intervening  Event.  If  an  Intervening  Event  occurs,  ECU  Securityholders  other  than  the  ECU 
Locked-Up  Securityholders,  are  free  to  vote  against  the  Arrangement  Resolution.  In  the  event  that  the 
Arrangement Agreement is terminated by Golden as a result of ECU changing its recommendation in favour of the 
approval  of  the  Arrangement  Resolution  and  the  ECU  Termination  Fee  is  paid,  then  the  Voting  Agreement  to 
which the ECU Locked-Up Securityholders are party will also terminate and such securityholders will also be free 
to vote against the Arrangement Resolution.
Independent  Advice.  ECU  retained  independent  financial  and  legal  advisors  who  advised  ECU  throughout  the 
process as noted above.
Arm’s-length  Negotiations.  The  Arrangement  Agreement  is  a  result  of  arm’s-length  negotiations  between  ECU
and Golden.

Risk Factors of the Arrangement
In the course of its deliberations, the ECU Board also identified and considered a variety of risks and potentially negative 
factors in connection with the Arrangement, including, but not limited to, the following:
!
!
!
!
!
!
!
!
!
!
!
!
!
!
!
!
The Exchange Ratio is fixed and, as a result, the Golden Stock issued on closing of the Arrangement may have a 
market value different than at the time of announcement of the Arrangement.
The completion of the Arrangement is subject to several conditions that must be satisfied or waived.
The Arrangement Agreement may be terminated by ECU or Golden in certain circumstances, in which case the 
market price for ECU Shares may be adversely affected.
The  Combined  Company  will  incur  significant  transaction,  combination-related  and  restructuring  costs  in 
connection with the Arrangement.
The  Combined  Company  may  incur  significant  costs  related  to  contractual  arrangements  that  are  not  currently 
anticipated.
The exercise of Dissent Rights  may increase the consideration payable pursuant to the  Plan of  Arrangement or 
hinder the closing of the Arrangement.
The  directors  and  officers  of  ECU  may  have  interests  that  are  different  from  the  interests  of  other  ECU 
Securityholders.
The trading price of Golden Stock could be depressed by sales of shares of Golden Stock by ECU Securityholders 
or Golden Stockholders who sell their shares of Golden Stock.
The existence of a significant number of options and warrants may have a negative effect on the market price of 
Golden Stock.
The  ECU  Termination  Fee  provided  for  under  the  Arrangement  Agreement  may  discourage  other  parties  from 
attempting to acquire ECU. If ECU is required to pay the ECU Termination Fee and an alternative transaction is 
not completed, ECU’s financial condition will be materially adversely affected.
If ECU is required to pay the expense reimbursement fee contemplated by the Arrangement Agreement in certain 
circumstances, ECU’s financial condition will be materially adversely affected.
The Arrangement  will present challenges associated  with integrating operations, personnel and other aspects of 
ECU and Golden.
ECU  and  Golden  have  both  historically  incurred  operating  losses  and  operating  cash  flow  deficits  and  it  is 
expected that the Combined Company will continue to incur operating losses in the foreseeable future.
ECU’s and Golden’s properties may not contain mineral reserves.
The Combined Company is expected to continue to require substantial external financing to pay its operating and 
general and administrative expenses, continue the advancement of the Velardeña Property expansion and the El 
Quevar Project and fund its other exploration activities.
The  Combined  Company  will  be  subject  to  a  broad  range  of  Environmental  Laws  and  associated  costs  and 
liabilities.

The long-term cash flow and profitability of the Combined Company will be affected by changes in the prices of 
silver and other metals.
If the Combined Company is unable to obtain all of its required governmental permits or obtain property rights on 
favourable terms or at all, its operations could be negatively impacted.
The Combined Company may not meet key production or cost estimates.
See “Risk Factors”. Also see “The Arrangement – Opinion of the Fairness Advisor” and the financial statements of Golden 
incorporated by reference into this Circular.
The  ECU  Board’s  reasons  for  recommending  the  Arrangement  include  certain  assumptions  relating  to  forward-looking 
information,  and  such  information  and  assumptions  are  subject  to  various  risks.  See  “Cautionary  Statement  Regarding 
Forward-Looking Statements” in this Circular.
The foregoing summary of the information and factors considered by the ECU Board is not intended to be exhaustive. In 
view  of  the  variety  of  factors  and  the  amount  of  information  considered  in  connection  with  its  evaluation  of  the 
Arrangement, the ECU Board did not find it practical to, and did not, quantify or otherwise attempt to assign any relative 
weight  to  each  specific  factor  considered  in  reaching  its  conclusion  and  recommendation.  The  ECU  Board’s 
recommendation was made after considering all of the above-noted factors and in light of the ECU Board’s knowledge of 
the business, financial condition and prospects of ECU, and was also based on the advice of financial advisors and legal 
advisors to the ECU Board. In addition, individual  members of the ECU Board may  have assigned different  weights to 
different factors.

capable of becoming a shareholders’ agreement, voting trust or other agreement affecting or restricting its ability 
to exercise all voting rights attaching to its ECU Securities.
However, nothing contained in the Voting Agreement: (a) restricts, limits or prohibits an ECU Locked-Up Securityholder 
from exercising (solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of ECU) his or her fiduciary duties to ECU  under

relating to the fiduciary duties of directors and officers and provided further that such officer or director has first obtained

Securityholder shall remain obligated to vote or cause to be voted all his or her ECU Securities in the manner provided for 
by the Voting Agreement regardless of the position that the ECU Board takes, or its recommendation, with respect to the 
Arrangement Resolution.
The Voting  Agreement  shall  automatically terminate on  the later of (i) in the event that the  Arrangement  Agreement is

Terms of the Arrangement
The  purpose  of  the  Arrangement  is  to  effect  a  business  combination  between  ECU  and  Golden.  Pursuant  to  the 
Arrangement, Golden  will acquire all of the issued and outstanding ECU Shares, ECU Options and ECU Warrants  and 
ECU will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Golden.  As a result of the Arrangement, ECU Shareholders (other than 
Dissenting Shareholders and Golden) will receive shares of Golden Stock for their ECU Shares at the Exchange Ratio plus 
a cash payment of Cdn$0.000394 for each ECU Share held, ECU Optionholders and ECU Warrantholders will receive in 
exchange for their ECU Options and ECU Warrants, respectively, Golden Replacement Options and Golden Replacement 
Warrants,  as  applicable,  adjusted  based  on  the  Exchange  Ratio,  and  the  ECU  Convertible  Noteholder  will  receive  ECU 
Replacement Notes  in exchange for its ECU  Convertible  Notes.   The Arrangement is to be carried out pursuant  to the 
Arrangement Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement.

Option Plan):
(i)
subject to receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals, all ECU Options that remain outstanding at the 
Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall, without further action or formality by or on behalf of 
the  holders  thereof,  be  transferred  and  assigned  (free  and  clear  of  all  Liens)  by  the  holders  thereof  to 
Golden  and  Golden  Replacement  Options  shall  be  issued  pursuant  to  the  Golden  Replacement  Option 
Plan in exchange for such ECU Options on the basis that:
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)
such  Golden  Replacement  Options  will  be  exercisable  to  acquire  that  number  of  shares  of

acquired  if  such  holders  had  exercised  such  ECU  Options  immediately  prior  to  the  Effective 
Time and had received ECU Shares in exchange therefor; provided, however, that, in the event 
that the exchange of any ECU Options for Golden Replacement Options results in the Golden 
Option In-the-Money Amount exceeding the ECU Option In-the-Money Amount, the number of 
shares of Golden Stock for which each Golden Replacement Option received on such exchange 
may be exercised will be adjusted with effect at and from the Effective Time so as to ensure, in 
accordance  with  subsection  7(1.4)  of  the  Tax  Act,  that  the  Golden  Option  In-The-Money 
Amount  does  not  exceed  the  ECU  Option  In-The-Money  Amount;  provided,  further,  that  no 
fractional Golden Replacement Options shall be issued to any person but shall be rounded up or 
down in accordance with the Plan of Arrangement;
the vesting terms applicable to such Golden Replacement Options will be identical to the vesting 
terms applicable to the ECU Options for which they are exchanged;
the expiry date of such Golden Replacement Options shall be identical to the expiry date of the 
ECU Options for which they are exchanged; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any term 
or  provision  of  such  ECU  Options  or  the  ECU  Stock  Option  Plan,  any  Golden  Replacement 
Options issued in exchange therefor to persons who cease to be employees, officers, directors or 
consultants of ECU or any of its affiliates within 180 days of the Effective Date shall expire on 
the  date  that  is  the  earlier  of  (I)  two  years  following  the  Effective  Date  and  (II)  the  original 
expiry date of such ECU Options;
the aggregate exercise price of such Golden Replacement Options shall be equal to the aggregate 
exercise  price  of  the  ECU  Options  replaced  by  such  Golden  Replacement  Options,  such 
calculation to be applied separately to each grant of ECU Options; and
the  terms  and  conditions  otherwise  applicable  to  such  Golden  Replacement  Options  shall  be 
those set forth in the ECU Stock Option Plan;
(ii)
the holder of each ECU Option transferred and assigned to Golden shall cease to be the holder thereof 
and shall cease to have any rights as a holder or former holder in respect of such ECU Option or under the 
ECU Stock Option Plan, the name of such holder shall be removed from the register of holders of ECU 
Options maintained by or on behalf of ECU as of the Effective Time and added to the register of holders 
maintained  by  or  on  behalf  of  Golden  in  respect  of  Golden  Replacement  Options  as  of  the  Effective 
Time, and all option agreements, grants and similar instruments relating to such ECU Option shall be, and 
shall be deemed to be, transferred to and assumed by Golden; and
(iii)
each ECU Option transferred and assigned to Golden shall, without any further action by or on behalf of 
Golden, be cancelled immediately following such transfer and assignment and Golden shall be deemed to

have  executed  and  delivered  all  consents,  approvals,  releases,  assignments  and  waivers,  statutory, 
contractual or otherwise, required to cancel such ECU Option;
provided that none of the foregoing steps (a) to (h) will occur or will be deemed to occur unless all of the foregoing steps 
occur.
The Consideration payable to an ECU Securityholder pursuant to the foregoing steps (a) to (h) will be adjusted to reflect 
fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split, dividend (including any dividend or distribution of ECU Shares or securities 
convertible into ECU Shares), consolidation, reorganization, arrangement, recapitalization or other like change with respect 
to ECU Shares occurring after the date of the Arrangement Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.
As  of  the  close  of  business  on  July  22,  2011,  the  number  of  issued  and  outstanding  ECU  Securities  was  as  follows:  
320,081,333 ECU Shares; 13,235,000 ECU Options; 44,365,826 ECU Warrants; and Cdn$15,000,000 principal amount of 
ECU Convertible Notes. Assuming no issuance of additional ECU Shares, ECU Options or ECU Warrants, Golden will 
issue approximately 16,004,066 shares of Golden Stock in exchange for ECU Shares and reserve approximately 2,880,042 
shares of Golden Stock for issuance on the exercise of Golden Replacement Options and Golden Replacement Warrants.
Upon the completion of the Arrangement: (a) former ECU Shareholders will own approximately 51% of the outstanding 
Golden Stock, assuming that no outstanding ECU Options and ECU Warrants are exercised before consummation of the 
Arrangement;  and  (b)  former  ECU  Securityholders  will  own  approximately  55%  of  the  outstanding  Golden  Stock if  all 
outstanding ECU Options and ECU Warrants are exercised before consummation of the Arrangement.
See the Plan of Arrangement attached as Appendix C for additional information.
Opinion of the Fairness Advisor
ECU  entered  into  an  engagement  letter  with  the  Fairness  Advisor  pursuant  to  which,  among  other  things,  the  Fairness 
Advisor  agreed  to  provide  ECU  with  its  opinion  as  to  the  fairness  of  the  Consideration  to  be  received  pursuant  to  the 
Arrangement,  from  a  financial  point  of  view,  to  ECU  Shareholders  other  than  Golden  and  its  affiliates.  Initially,  the 
Fairness Advisor orally delivered its opinion to the ECU Board that, as of June 23, 2011, the Consideration to be paid by 
Golden to holders of ECU Shares (other than Golden and its affiliates) pursuant to the terms of the Arrangement is fair, 
from a financial point of view, to the holders of ECU Shares (other than Golden and its affiliates). The Fairness Advisor 
subsequently delivered its written Fairness Opinion to the ECU Board which confirmed its oral opinion.
The full text of the Fairness Opinion, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and 
limitations  and  qualifications  on  the  review  undertaken  in  connection  with  the  opinion,  is  attached  to  this  Circular  as 
Appendix D. The Fairness Advisor provided its opinion for the information and assistance of the ECU Board in connection 
with their consideration of the Arrangement. The Fairness Opinion addresses only the fairness of the Consideration to be 
received  by  the  ECU  Shareholders,  other  than  Golden  and  its  affiliates,  is  for  the  information  of  the  ECU  Board  in 
connection  with  its  consideration  of  the  proposed  Arrangement  only,  and  is  not  a  recommendation  as  to  how  any  ECU 
Securityholder should vote with respect to the Arrangement Resolution. ECU Securityholders are urged to read the entire 
Fairness  Opinion.  In  providing  the  Fairness  Opinion,  the  Fairness  Advisor  relied  upon,  and  assumed  the  completeness, 
accuracy and  fair representation of all  financial information,  forecasts and other information, data, advice, opinions  and 
representations obtained by it from public sources or provided by or on behalf of ECU. The terms of the  Arrangement, 
including the Exchange Ratio, were determined through negotiations between ECU and Golden and were not determined by 
the Fairness Advisor. The Fairness Opinion does not address the relative merits of the Arrangement as compared to any 
other business strategies or transactions that might be available to ECU, or the underlying decision of the ECU Board to 
recommend or effect the Arrangement. This summary of the Fairness Opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the 
full text of the Fairness Opinion and ECU Securityholders are urged to read the Fairness Opinion in its entirety.
The preparation of the Fairness Opinion by the Fairness Advisor involved various determinations as to the most appropriate 
and  relevant  assumptions  and  methods  of  financial  analysis  and  the  application  of  these  methods  to  the  particular 
circumstances and, therefore, the Fairness Opinion is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. 
Qualitative judgments were made based upon the Fairness Advisor’s assessment of the surrounding factual circumstances 
relating  to  the  Arrangement  and  its  analysis  of  such  factual  circumstances  in  its  best  judgment.  Any  attempt  to  select
- 65 -

if you have any questions, or require assistance completing your Proxy.
portions of the Fairness Advisor’s analyses or of the factors considered, without considering all of the analyses employed 
and  factors  considered,  would  likely  create  an  incomplete  and  misleading  view  of  the  process  underlying  the  Fairness 
Opinion.
Under its engagement letter with the Fairness Advisor, ECU agreed to pay the Fairness Advisor a fee for the delivery of the 
Fairness  Opinion  and  ECU  also  agreed  to  indemnify  the  Fairness  Advisor  and  certain  related  persons  against  certain 
liabilities in connection with its engagement.
The  Fairness  Advisor  provides  independent  research,  Canadian  equity  sales  coverage,  trading  execution  and  investment 
banking  services  to  an  extensive  network  of  North  American  institutional  and  corporate  clients.  The  principals  of  the 
Fairness Advisor have been involved in a significant number of transactions involving fairness opinions and valuations of 
private and publicly-traded companies. The professionals involved in the preparation of the Fairness Opinion include senior 
officers and directors of the Fairness Advisor who are experienced in merger, acquisition and divestiture matters. The form 
and content of the Fairness Opinion were approved for release by the Management Committee of the Fairness Advisor.
The Fairness Advisor is not an insider, associate or affiliate of ECU or any of its respective associates or affiliates. Other 
than  its  engagement  in  connection  with  providing  the  Fairness  Option,  the  Fairness  Advisor  has  not  been  engaged  to 
provide any financial advisory services nor has it participated in any financings involving ECU or Golden or any of their 
respective associates or affiliates within the two years prior to the date of the Fairness Opinion.
Securityholder and Court Approvals
Securityholder Approval
Pursuant to the Plan of  Arrangement and the requirements of  Canadian Securities  Laws and  the TSX, the  Arrangement 
Resolution must be passed by: (a) at least 66 2/3% of the votes cast by ECU Shareholders present in person or represented 
by proxy at the Meeting and entitled to  vote; (b) at least  66 2/3% of the  votes cast by all ECU  Securityholders, voting 
together as a single class, present in person or represented by proxy at the Meeting and entitled to vote; and (c) a simple 
majority of the votes cast by ECU Shareholders present in person or represented by proxy at the Meeting and entitled to 
vote  after  excluding  the  votes  cast  in  respect  of  ECU  Shares  beneficially  owned  or  over  which  control  or  direction  is 
exercised by Mr. Michel Roy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ECU, and Mr. Stephen J. Altmann, President of 
ECU,  and  by  their  respective  related  parties  or  joint  actors.    See  “Securities  Law  Considerations  –  Canadian  Securities 
Laws – Requirement for Minority Approval under MI 61-101”.
Each  ECU  Security  that  is  voted  at  the  Meeting  will  vote  only  once  on  the  Arrangement  Resolution  but  three  separate 
tabulations  of  the  votes  will  be  conducted,  one  for  each  of  the  foregoing  required  approvals.    ECU  Shareholders,  ECU 
Optionholders and ECU Warrantholders are entitled to one vote for each ECU Share, ECU Option or ECU Warrant, as 
applicable, held by them, and the ECU Convertible Noteholder is entitled to such number of votes as is equal to the number 
of ECU Shares into which the ECU Convertible Notes held by it are convertible. The Arrangement Resolution must receive 
the required ECU Securityholder approval in order for ECU to seek the Final Order and implement the Arrangement on the 
Effective Date.
For ease of reference, the breakdown, as of July 22, 2011, of the votes among ECU Securityholders voting as a single class 
is as follows:

Court Approval of the Arrangement
The QBCA requires that the Court approve the Arrangement.
On  July  14,  2011,  ECU  obtained  the  Interim  Order  providing  for  the  calling  and  holding  of  the  Meeting  and  other 
procedural matters and filed a Notice of Hearing for a Final Order to approve the Arrangement. Copies of the Interim Order 
and the Notice of Hearing for a Final Order are attached as Appendix E and F, respectively, to this Circular.
The Court hearing in respect of the Final Order is expected to take place at 9:00 a.m. (Eastern Time), on August 31, 2011, 
or at any other date before or after August 31, 2011 (subject to ECU providing notification by news release, and serving 
notice on persons having filed a Notice of Appearance (defined below), of the new hearing date in accordance with the 
Interim Order), at the Quebec Courthouse located at 300 boulevard Jean-Lesage, Quebec City, Québec G1K 8K6, subject to 
obtaining the approval of the Arrangement Resolution at the Meeting. At the hearing, the Court will consider, among other 
things, the fairness of the terms and conditions of the Arrangement to those to whom securities will be issued.  The Court 
may approve the Arrangement in any manner the Court may direct, subject to compliance with such terms and conditions, 
if any, as the Court deems fit.  Prior to the hearing on the Final Order, the Court will be informed that the Final Order will 
also constitute the basis  for an exemption  from registration under the U.S. Securities  Act  for the Golden Stock, Golden 
Replacement Options and Golden Replacement Warrants to be issued in the Arrangement to ECU Securityholders pursuant 
to the Section 3(a)(10) Exemption.
Under the terms of the Interim Order, each ECU Securityholder, as well as other interested persons, will have the right to 
appear and be heard at the hearing of the application for the Final Order, with a view to contesting the application for a 
Final Order or to make representations in relation thereto. Any person desiring to appear at the hearing of the application 
for the Final Order is required to file in the Court record and serve on ECU at the address set out below, at least five (5) 
clear juridical days prior to the hearing of the application for a Final Order, a notice of his, her or its intention to appear 
(“Notice  of  Appearance”),  including  his,  her  or  its  address  for  service,  together  with  a  written  contestation  or  written 
representations, as the case may be, supported, as to the facts, by affidavits and exhibits, if any, failing which such person 
shall not be permitted to contest the application for a Final Order. In the event that the application for a Final Order does 
not proceed on the date set forth in the Notice of Hearing for a Final Order, and is adjourned or postponed, only those 
persons who served and filed a Notice of Appearance in accordance with the Interim Order shall be given notice of the 
adjourned or postponed date of the Court hearing.
The Notice of Appearance and supporting materials must be served, within the time specified, on counsel for ECU at the

Arrangement Mechanics
Payment of Consideration
Following receipt of the Final Order and prior to the filing of the Articles of Arrangement with the Enterprise Registrar, 
Golden shall deposit with the Depositary in escrow, for the benefit of holders of ECU Securities, sufficient funds, shares of 
Golden Stock and Golden Replacement Warrants in the aggregate amounts necessary to pay the Consideration required by 
the Plan of Arrangement.  All money deposited or caused to be deposited shall be cash denominated in Canadian dollars in 
same day funds and shall not be used for any purpose except as provided in the Plan of Arrangement.
Subject  to  surrender  to  the  Depositary  for  cancellation  of  a  certificate  which  immediately  prior  to  the  Effective  Time 
represented outstanding ECU Shares or ECU Warrants, together with a duly completed and executed Letter of Transmittal 
and such additional documents and instruments as the Depositary may reasonably require, following the Effective Time the 
holder of such surrendered certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Depositary shall deliver to 
such holder, the Consideration to which such holder is entitled under the Plan of Arrangement, less any amounts described 
under “The Arrangement – Arrangement Mechanics – Withholding Rights” below, and any certificate so surrendered shall 
forthwith be cancelled.
Until surrendered, each certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented ECU Shares or ECU Warrants 
shall be deemed after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the Consideration to 
which the holder thereof is entitled in lieu of such certificate under the Plan of Arrangement, less any amounts described 
under “Arrangement Mechanics – Withholding Rights” below. Any such certificate formerly representing ECU Shares or 
ECU Warrants not duly surrendered on or before the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date shall:
(i)
(ii)
cease to represent a claim by, or interest of, any former holder of ECU Shares or ECU Warrants of any 
kind or nature against or in ECU or Golden (or any successor to any of the foregoing); and
be deemed to have been surrendered to Golden and shall be cancelled.
Any right or claim to payment pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement that remains outstanding on the sixth anniversary of the 
Effective Date shall cease to represent a right or claim of any kind or nature whatsoever and the right of the former ECU 
Securityholder  to  receive  the  Consideration  to  which  such  holder  is  entitled  pursuant  to  the  Plan  of  Arrangement  shall 
terminate and be deemed to be surrendered and forfeited, for no consideration, to Golden (or any successor of Golden).
No holder of ECU Securities shall be entitled to receive any consideration with respect to such ECU Securities other than 
the Consideration to which such holder is entitled in accordance with the Plan of Arrangement and, for greater certainty, no 
such holder will be entitled to receive any interest, dividends, premium or other payment in connection therewith.
Withholding Rights
Golden, ECU and the Depositary, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any Consideration payable or 
otherwise deliverable to any former holder of ECU Securities such amounts as Golden, ECU and the Depositary may be 
required to deduct and withhold therefrom under any provision of applicable Laws in respect of applicable taxes.  To the 
extent that such amounts are so deducted and withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes hereof as having been 
paid to the person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.  Golden, ECU or the Depositary, as applicable, 
may  sell  or  otherwise  dispose  of  such  portion  of  the  Consideration  otherwise  payable  to  such  holder  as  is  necessary  to 
provide sufficient  funds to enable Golden, ECU or the Depositary, as applicable, to comply  with such deduction and/or 
withholding requirements and Golden, ECU and the Depositary, as applicable, shall notify the holder thereof and remit any 
unapplied balance of the net proceeds of such sale.
No Fractional Securities will be issued
In accordance with the Plan of Arrangement, no fractional shares of Golden Stock, fractional Golden Replacement Options 
or fractional Golden Replacement Warrants shall be issued to any person pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement.  The number 
of shares of Golden Stock,  Golden Replacement Options and Golden Replacement Warrants to be issued to any person
- 68 -

if you have any questions, or require assistance completing your Proxy.
pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement shall be rounded up or down, as applicable, to the nearest  whole share of Golden 
Stock. For greater certainty, where such fractional interest is greater than or equal to 0.5, the number of shares of Golden 
Stock, Golden Replacement Options or Golden Replacement Warrants, as applicable, to be issued to any person will be 
rounded up to the nearest whole number and where such fractional interest is less than 0.5, the number of shares of Golden 
Stock, Golden Replacement Options or Golden Replacement Warrants, as applicable,  to be issued will be rounded down to 
the  nearest  whole  number.  In  calculating  such  fractional  interests,  all  ECU  Shares,  ECU  Options  or  ECU  Warrants,  as 
applicable, registered in the name of or beneficially held by an ECU Securityholder or its nominee shall be aggregated.
Letters of Transmittal
Included  with  this  Circular  is  a  Letter  of  Transmittal  in  respect  of  ECU  Shares,  printed  on  blue  paper,  and  a  Letter  of 
Transmittal in respect of ECU Warrants, printed on yellow paper. In order to receive shares of Golden Stock and the cash 
payment for their ECU Shares or Golden Replacement Warrants for their ECU Warrants, as the case may be, Registered
Shareholders  or  Registered  Warrantholders  must  complete  and  sign  the  appropriate  Letter  of  Transmittal  and  deliver  it, 
together  with  certificates  representing  their  ECU  Shares  or  ECU  Warrants  and  the  other  required  documents,  to  the 
Depositary  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  contained  in  such  applicable  Letter  of  Transmittal  included  with  this 
Circular. The Letters of Transmittal contain procedural information relating to the Arrangement and should be reviewed 
carefully.  The  deposit  of  ECU  Shares  or  ECU  Warrants  pursuant  to  the  procedures  in  the  Letters  of  Transmittal  will 
constitute a binding agreement between the depositing ECU Shareholder or ECU Warrantholder, as applicable, and Golden 
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Circular and the applicable Letter of Transmittal.
Copies of the Letters of Transmittal may be obtained by contacting the Depositary. The Letters of Transmittal will also be 
available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com under ECU’s profile.
Golden reserves the right to waive or not to waive any and all errors or other deficiencies in any Letter of Transmittal or 
other  document  and  any  such  waiver  or  non-waiver  will  be  binding  upon  the  affected  ECU  Shareholder  or  ECU 
Warrantholder. The granting of a waiver to one or more ECU Shareholders or ECU Warrantholders does not constitute a 
waiver for any other ECU Shareholder or ECU Warrantholder. Golden and the Depository reserve the right to demand strict 
compliance  with the terms of the Letters of Transmittal and the Arrangement. The method used to deliver the Letter of 
Transmittal and any accompanying certificates representing ECU Shares or ECU Warrants is at the option and risk of the 
holder surrendering them, and delivery will be deemed effective only when such documents are actually received by the 
Depositary. ECU recommends that the necessary documentation be hand delivered to the Depositary, and a receipt obtained 
therefor;  otherwise,  the  use  of  registered  mail  with  return  receipt  requested,  and  with  proper  insurance  obtained,  is 
recommended.
ECU Shareholders  whose ECU Shares, or ECU Warrantholders  whose ECU Warrants,  are registered in the name of an 
Intermediary (such as a broker, investment dealer, bank, trust company, trustee or other intermediary) or other nominee 
should contact that Intermediary or nominee for assistance in depositing their ECU Shares or ECU Warrants and should 
follow the instructions of such Intermediary or nominee in order to deposit their ECU Shares or ECU Warrants.
Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates
In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented one or more outstanding ECU Shares 
or ECU Warrants that are entitled to  Consideration pursuant to the Plan of  Arrangement shall  have been lost, stolen or 
destroyed,  the  Letter  of  Transmittal  should  be  completed  as  fully  as  possible  and  forwarded,  together  with  a  letter 
describing the loss, theft or destruction, to the Depositary.  Upon the making of an affidavit or statutory declaration of that 
fact  by  the  person  claiming  such  certificate  to  be  lost,  stolen  or  destroyed  and  who  was  listed  immediately  prior  to the 
Effective Time as the registered holder thereof on the ECU Share register or ECU Warrant register maintained by or on 
behalf  of  ECU,  as  applicable,  the  Depositary  will  deliver  in  exchange  for  such  lost,  stolen  or  destroyed  certificate  the 
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, provided that 
the  holder  to  whom  the  Consideration  is  to  be  delivered  shall,  as  a  condition  precedent  to  the  delivery,  give  a  bond 
satisfactory to Golden and the Depositary in such sum as Golden and the Depositary may direct (each acting reasonably), or 
otherwise  indemnify  Golden  and  the  Depositary  in  a  manner  satisfactory  to  Golden  and  the  Depositary  (each  acting 
reasonably) against any claim that may be made against Golden or the Depositary with respect to the certificate alleged to 
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Distributions with Respect to Unsurrendered Certificates
No dividend or other distribution declared or paid after the Effective Time with respect to Golden Stock shall be delivered 
to the holder of any certificate formerly representing ECU Shares unless and until the holder of such certificate shall have 
complied  with  the  provisions  of  the  Plan  of  Arrangement  in  respect  of  the  surrender  of  such  certificates.    Subject  to 
applicable Law and to the Plan of Arrangement, at the time of such compliance, there shall, in addition to the delivery of 
the Consideration to which such holder is thereby entitled, be delivered to such holder, without interest, the amount of any 
dividend or other distribution declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to the Golden Stock to which such 
holder is entitled in respect of such holder’s Consideration.
ECU Options
No  certificates  representing  ECU  Options  have  been  issued;  accordingly,  there  are  no  ECU  Option  certificates  to  be 
surrendered in connection with the Arrangement and ECU Optionholders do not need to complete a Letter of Transmittal 
with respect to their ECU Options.  The name of each ECU Optionholder shall be removed from the register of holders of 
ECU Options maintained by or on behalf of ECU as of the Effective Time and added to the register of holders maintained 
by or on behalf of Golden in respect of Golden Replacement Options as of the Effective Time in accordance with the steps 
of the Plan of Arrangement.  Golden will send each holder of Golden Replacement Options a notice confirming the details 
of their Golden Replacement Options following the Effective Date.
ECU Convertible Notes
The ECU Convertible Noteholder does not need to complete a Letter of Transmittal with respect to its ECU Convertible 
Notes.  Arrangements will be made by ECU and Golden following the Effective Date with respect to documentation related 
to the issuance of the ECU Replacement Notes.
Fees, Costs and Expenses of the Arrangement
Except as otherwise provided by the Arrangement Agreement in the event the Arrangement Agreement is terminated, all 
fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection  with the Arrangement Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement shall be 
paid by the party incurring the expenses.
ECU estimates that it will incur fees and related expenses in the aggregate amount of approximately Cdn$7.2 million if the 
Arrangement  is  completed  including,  without  limitation,  Fairness  Advisor  fees,  Financial  Advisors  fees,  legal  and 
accounting fees, filing fees, proxy solicitation fees and the costs of preparing, printing and mailing this Circular.
Interests of Directors and Officers of ECU in the Arrangement
In considering the recommendation of the ECU Board, ECU Securityholders should be aware that members of the ECU 
Board and the officers of ECU have interests in the Arrangement or may receive benefits that may differ from, or be in 
addition to, the interests of ECU Securityholders generally. These interests and benefits are described below.
All benefits received, or to be received, by directors or officers of ECU as a result of the Arrangement are, and will be, 
solely in connection with their services as directors or employees of ECU or the Combined Company.  No benefit has been, 
or  will  be,  conferred  for  the  purpose  of  increasing  the  value  of  consideration  payable  to  any  such  person  for  ECU 
Securities, nor is it, or will it be, conditional on the person supporting the Arrangement.
ECU Securityholdings
As  of  July  22,  2011,  the  directors  and  officers  of  ECU,  and,  to  the  knowledge  of  ECU  after  reasonable  inquiry,  their 
respective affiliates or associates, beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, or exercised control or direction over, in the

the  Arrangement  as  ECU  Shares  held  by  any  other  ECU  Shareholders  and  ECU  Options  held  by  any  other  ECU

Severance and Change of Control Payments
Michel Roy.  Under the terms of a letter agreement dated May 31, 2011 between ECU and Mr. Michel Roy, Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer of ECU, Mr. Roy is entitled to receive a Cdn$1,500,000 bonus payment if there is a “change of 
control” of ECU.  The Arrangement will result in a “change of control” for the purposes of such agreement with Mr. Roy;
accordingly, he will be entitled to a Cdn$1,500,000 bonus payment upon closing of the Arrangement. Mr. Roy has agreed 
with Golden to waive this payment and instead receive Cdn$1.5 million in shares of Golden Stock. The number of such 
shares of Golden Stock to be issued to Mr. Roy will be determined on the Effective Date based upon the VWAP of Golden 
Stock on the NYSE Amex for the five trading days immediately prior to the Effective Date. Based on the closing price of 
US$17.42 for Golden Stock on July 26, 2011 (and the currency exchange rate on such date), 91,128 shares of Golden Stock 
would be issued to Mr. Roy.
Stephen  J.  Altmann.    Under  the  terms  of  a  letter  agreement  dated  May  31,  2011  between  ECU  and  Mr.  Stephen  J. 
Altmann, President of ECU, Mr. Altmann is entitled to receive a Cdn$1,250,000 bonus payment if there is a “change of 
control”  of  ECU.  The  Arrangement  will  result  in  a  “change  of  control”  for  the  purposes  of  such  agreement  with  Mr.

Altmann;  accordingly,  he  will  be  entitled  to  a  Cdn$1,250,000  bonus  payment  upon  closing  of  the  Arrangement.  In 
connection with the anticipated terms of Mr. Altmann’s intended employment with Golden following the Arrangement, as 
described  in  the  following  paragraph,  it  is  anticipated  that  Mr. Altmann  will  waive  the  benefit  of  the  change  of  control 
bonus payment and instead receive Cdn$1.25 million in restricted Golden Stock, of which 40%, 40% and 20% would vest 
on  the  first,  second  and  third  anniversaries,  respectively,  of  the  grant  date,  or  100%  would  vest  upon  termination  of 
Mr. Altmann’s employment with Golden for any reason. The number of such shares of restricted Golden Stock to be issued 
to Mr. Altmann will be determined on the Effective Date based upon the VWAP of Golden Stock on the NYSE Amex for 
the five trading days immediately prior to the Effective Date. Based on the closing price of US$17.42 for Golden Stock on 
July  26,  2011  (and  the  currency  exchange  rate  on  such  date),  75,940  shares  of  Golden  Stock  would  be  issued  to  Mr. 
Altmann.
The independent members of the ECU Board determined that ECU should enter into the May 31, 2011 letter agreements 
referred  to  above  with  each  of  Mr.  Roy  and  Mr.  Altmann  in  recognition  of  the  past,  and  anticipated  future,  significant 
efforts of these two senior officers in connection with the pursuit of strategic transactions for the benefit of ECU and its 
securityholders, and that the payments contemplated thereby were consistent with industry norms.
In addition with respect to Mr. Altmann, under the terms of the current employment agreement between Mr. Altmann and 
ECU, Mr. Altmann is entitled to receive a severance payment of Cdn$750,000 (being the sum of three years of current base 
salary and annual bonus) if he is terminated by ECU without cause or if he resigns following the sale or transfer of the 
assets or shares of ECU. However, in connection with the Arrangement, Golden intends to offer Mr. Altmann the position 
of President, with an annual salary of US$350,000, an annual target bonus equal to 50% of annual salary and an annual 
target equity award valued at 100% of annual salary. Accordingly, if Mr. Altmann is appointed to such position, he would 
not receive any severance payment pursuant to his current employment agreement with ECU.  In addition, Mr. Altmann 
will  be  offered  by  Golden  a  change  of  control  agreement  on  the  same  terms  as  the  change  of  control  agreements  with 
Golden’s  other  executive  officers,  including  an  enhanced  severance  payment  of  200%  of  target  salary  and  bonus  in  the 
event  of  termination  following  a  change  of  control,  and  will  be  eligible  to  participate  in  all  other  benefits  available 
generally to all salaried employees of Golden.
Dwight Walker.  Under the terms of the employment agreement between ECU and Mr. Dwight Walker, Chief Financial 
Officer of ECU, Mr. Walker is entitled to receive a severance payment of Cdn$450,000 (being the sum of three years of 
current  base  salary  and  annual  bonus)  if  he  is  terminated  by  ECU  without  cause  or  if  he  resigns  following  the  sale  or 
transfer  of  the  assets  or  shares  of  ECU.  Mr.  Walker  will  not  continue  as  an  employee  of  the  Combined  Company  and 
therefore, the Cdn$450,000 severance payment will be payable to him upon closing of the Arrangement.
Other Senior Management.  The ECU Board has also approved a discretionary pool of Cdn$500,000 to be paid, in the 
discretion of Mr. Roy and Mr. Altmann, to certain officers or employees of ECU upon consummation of the Arrangement. 
The recipients of the payments from this discretionary bonus pool have not been determined, but it is anticipated that Mr. 
Walker would receive a payment of Cdn$150,000. Neither Mr. Roy nor Mr. Altmann is eligible to receive payments from 
this discretionary bonus pool.
Any  change  of  control  bonus  payments  that  Mr.  Roy  and  Mr.  Altmann  are  entitled  to  receive  as  a  consequence  of  the 
Arrangement  are  considered  to  be  “collateral  benefits”  for  the  purposes  of  MI  61-101.  Accordingly,  Mr.  Roy  and  Mr. 
Altmann are considered to be “interested parties” to the Arrangement for the purposes of MI 61-101, and the votes attached 
to the ECU Securities owned or controlled by Mr. Roy and Mr. Altmann, and by their respective “related parties” or “joint
actors”  as  defined  under  MI-61-101,  will  be  excluded  in  determining  whether  minority  approval  of  the  Arrangement 
Resolution has been obtained at the Meeting.  For such purposes, Mr. Roy has confirmed that the only person  who  is a 
related party to him that owns or controls ECU Securities is his spouse, Lucie Larivière, and that he has no joint actors that 
own or control ECU Securities. Mr. Altmann has confirmed that he has no related parties or joint actors that own or control 
ECU Securities.
The  severance  payment  that  Mr.  Walker  is  expected  to  receive,  as  well  as  the  discretionary  bonus  payments  that  Mr. 
Walker  and  other  members  of  senior  management  (excluding  Mr.  Roy  and  Mr.  Altmann)  are  expected  to  receive,  as  a 
consequence of the Arrangement are excluded from the definition of “collateral benefits” under MI 61-101, because, among 
other  things,  at  the  time  the  Arrangement  Agreement  was  agreed  to,  none  of  the  intended  recipients  of  such  payments 
beneficially owned or exercised control or direction over 1% or more of the outstanding ECU Shares.

for additional details.
Other Payments to Directors and Officers
In addition to the severance and change of control payments described above, the ECU Board has approved the payment of 
certain amounts to Mr. Roy and Mr. Altmann, as well as other members of ECU’s management team, as compensation for 
past services. The payments are in lieu of option awards that ECU planned to award to the individuals; ECU had previously 
concluded that such option awards were not advisable because of ECU’s ongoing review of strategic alternatives. The cash 
payments are equal to Cdn$175,000 for Mr. Roy, Cdn$150,000 for Mr. Altmann, and Cdn$100,000 in the aggregate for the 
remaining  members  of  ECU’s  management  team,  as  determined  in  the  discretion  of  Mr.  Roy  and  Mr.  Altmann.  It  is 
anticipated that ECU will make these payments prior to the consummation of the Arrangement. These payments are not 
contingent upon the completion of the Arrangement.
The ECU Board has also approved the payment of certain amounts to each of the two independent directors of ECU in 
consideration for past services. The cash payments for each are equal to Cdn$12,000 (representing Cdn$3,000 per quarter 
for the last four calendar quarters), plus an additional cash payment of Cdn$50,000. This Cdn$50,000 payment is in lieu of 
ECU Option awards that ECU planned to award to the directors. It is anticipated that ECU will make these payments prior 
to the consummation of the  Arrangement. Such payments are consistent  with ECU’s ordinary pay practices and are not 
contingent upon the completion of the Arrangement.
Indemnification of Directors and Officers
Under  the  Arrangement  Agreement,  Golden  agreed  that  it  shall  cause  ECU  and  its  subsidiaries  to  honour  all  rights  to 
expense reimbursement, indemnification or exculpation now existing in favour of present and former officers and directors 
of ECU and its subsidiaries as provided for in their respective articles and by-laws, and acknowledges that such rights shall 
survive the completion of the Plan of Arrangement and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than 
six years from the Effective Date.
In addition, under the Arrangement Agreement, Golden agreed that it will either (a) purchase prepaid non-cancellable run-
off directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be in effect without any reduction in scope or coverage for not less than six 
years from the Effective Date providing protection no less favourable than the protection provided by the policies currently 
maintained by ECU in favour of its directors and officers and providing protection in respect of claims arising from facts or 
events which occurred prior to the Effective Time or (b) purchase as an extension of the current insurance policies of ECU, 
prepaid non-cancellable run-off directors’ and officers’ liability insurance providing coverage comparable to that contained 
in the existing policies of ECU for six years from the Effective Time with respect to claims arising from or related to facts 
or events that occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, in each case subject to certain maximum purchase prices payable 
by Golden.
Private Placement
The following is a summary of the principal terms of the Private Placement. This summary does not purport to be complete 
and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Subscription Agreement, the terms of the ECU Convertible Notes and 
related documents which have been filed by ECU on SEDAR at www.sedar.com under ECU’s profile.
On June 24, 2011, Golden and ECU entered into the Subscription Agreement pursuant to which ECU issued to Golden, on 
July 13, 2011, Cdn$15.0 million principal amount of ECU Convertible Notes. The Private Placement is intended to provide 
ECU with interim financing of its operations pending consummation of the Arrangement. The ECU Convertible Notes will 
mature on June 30, 2012 (subject to extension as described below), and are convertible by Golden at any time prior to 5:00 
p.m. (Eastern Time) on June 29, 2012 into ECU Shares at a rate of 1,032 ECU Shares for each Cdn$1,000 in principal 
amount converted, consistent with the Exchange Ratio.  Upon the occurrence of certain specified fundamental changes, the 
ECU Convertible Notes may be redeemed or converted into ECU Shares at the option of Golden based on 102% of the 
outstanding principal amount of the ECU Convertible Notes. The ECU Convertible Notes are also redeemable by ECU at 
any time after the Record Date and prior to their maturity date at 100% of their face value plus accrued and unpaid interest.  
ECU may elect to extend the maturity of the ECU Convertible Notes to December 31, 2012 upon the making of a cash

if you have any questions, or require assistance completing your Proxy.
payment to Golden equal to 4% of the face value of the then outstanding ECU Convertible Notes, payable on the day the 
extension  option  is  exercised,  with  interest  accruing  on  the  ECU  Convertible  Notes  at  10%  per  annum  during  such 
extension period.
Under the terms of the ECU Convertible Notes, the proceeds of the Private Placement are held in an escrow account and 
may  only  be  used  by  ECU  for  specified  purposes,  including  (i) expenses  associated  with  development,  exploration, 
operating and general and administrative costs (including base salaries and employee benefits) relating to the development 
and  operating  activities  at  the  Velardeña  Property;  (ii) general  and  administrative  expenses,  including  base  salaries, 
employee benefits and the various expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Arrangement 
Agreement; (iii) regularly scheduled principal and interest payments on arm’s length indebtedness existing at the date of 
issuance of the ECU Convertible Notes; and (iv) such other expenditures as may be approved by Golden.  Bonus payments, 
severance payments, change of control payments or other termination payments are not permitted uses.  At the closing of 
the Private Placement, Cdn$2.85 million of the subscription proceeds  were released to ECU and the Cdn$12.15 million 
balance of the proceeds were placed in escrow.
Golden will have the right to vote the ECU Convertible Notes on the Arrangement Resolution at the Meeting together with 
the outstanding ECU Shares, ECU Options and ECU Warrants voting as a single class. The ECU Convertible Notes shall 
be  entitled  to  such  number  of  votes  at  the  Meeting  as  is  equal  to  the  number  of  ECU  Shares  into  which  the  ECU 
Convertible Notes are convertible, currently being 15,480,000 votes.
THE ARRANGEMENT AGREEMENT
The Arrangement will be carried out pursuant to the Arrangement Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement. The following 
is a summary of the principal terms of the Arrangement Agreement. This summary does not purport to be complete and is 
qualified in its entirety by reference to the Arrangement Agreement, appended hereto as Appendix B, and which has been 
filed by ECU on SEDAR at www.sedar.com under ECU’s profile, and to the Plan of Arrangement, which is attached as 
Schedule A to the Arrangement Agreement and appended hereto as Appendix C.
The Arrangement Agreement contains representations and warranties made by ECU and Golden. These representations 
and warranties were made by and to the parties thereto for the purposes of the Arrangement Agreement and are subject to 
the limitations and qualifications agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating and entering into the Arrangement 
Agreement.  In  addition,  certain  representations  and  warranties  were  made  as  of  specified  dates,  may  be  subject  to  a 
contractual standard of materiality different from what may be viewed as material to ECU Securityholders or may have 
been used for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties rather than for the purpose of establishing facts. Moreover, 
information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may have changed since the date of the 
Arrangement Agreement.
On June 24, 2011, ECU and Golden entered into the Arrangement Agreement, pursuant to which ECU and Golden agreed 
that, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Arrangement Agreement, the Parties would implement the Plan of 
Arrangement whereby Golden will acquire all of the issued and outstanding ECU Shares, ECU Options and ECU Warrants, 
and the ECU Convertible Notes would be replaced by the ECU Replacement Notes. As a result of the Arrangement, each 
ECU  Shareholder  (other  than  Dissenting  Shareholders  and  Golden)  will  receive  0.05  of  a  share  of  Golden  Stock  and 
Cdn$0.000394  in  cash  for  each  ECU  Share  held;  each  ECU  Optionholder  and  ECU  Warrantholder  will  receive  Golden 
Replacement  Options  and  Golden  Replacement  Warrants,  respectively,  for  their  ECU  Options  or  ECU  Warrants, 
exercisable to acquire that number of shares of Golden Stock that such holders would have acquired if they had exercised 
their  ECU  Options  or  ECU  Warrants,  as  applicable,  immediately  prior  to  the  Effective  Time;  the  ECU  Convertible 
Noteholder  will  receive  ECU  Replacement  Notes  in  replacement  of  its  outstanding  ECU  Convertible  Notes;  and  the 
Shareholder Rights Plan will be terminated and all SRP Rights will expire. The terms of the Arrangement Agreement are 
the result of arm’s length negotiations between ECU and Golden and their respective advisors.

(iii)
(iv)

Adverse Recommendation Change; Superior Proposal; Right to Match or Respond
ECU  may  make  an  ECU  Board  Change  in  Recommendation  and  Golden  may  make  a  Golden  Board  Change  in 
Recommendation (in each case, an “Adverse Recommendation Change”) (i) following receipt of an Acquisition Proposal 
that it determines to be a Superior Proposal or (ii) solely in response to any Intervening Event, in each case if it determines 
in good faith, after consultation with its legal advisors, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its 
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
Upon payment of the ECU Termination Fee, the ECU Board may terminate the Arrangement Agreement in order to accept 
and enter into an agreement in respect of an Acquisition Proposal that the ECU Board in good faith, after consultation with 
its  financial  and  outside  legal  advisors,  has  determined  is  a  Superior  Proposal.  Golden  will  have  the  right,  but  not  the 
obligation, to amend the terms of the Arrangement upon notification by ECU of a Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, 
as applicable, within a five (5) Business Day response period. Within five (5) Business Days of receiving any such proposal 
by Golden to amend the terms of the Arrangement, the ECU Board shall review and determine whether the Acquisition 
Proposal  to  which  Golden  is  responding  would  continue  to  be  a  Superior  Proposal,  or  whether  the  Adverse 
Recommendation  Change  is  still  necessary,  when  assessed  in  light  of  the  Arrangement  Agreement  and  the  Plan  of 
Arrangement as they are proposed by Golden to be amended. If the ECU Board determines that, in light of the proposed 
amendment  by  Golden,  the  Acquisition  Proposal  to  which  Golden  is  responding  would  not  continue  to  be  a  Superior 
Proposal, or the Adverse Recommendation Change would not be necessary, ECU is required to enter into an amendment to 
the  Arrangement  Agreement  to  give  effect  to  such  amendments  and  the  ECU  Board  must  promptly  reaffirm  its 
recommendation of the Plan of Arrangement.
Reciprocally, upon payment of the Golden Termination Fee, the Golden Board may terminate the Arrangement Agreement 
in order to accept and enter into an agreement in respect of an Acquisition Proposal that the Golden Board in good faith, 
after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors, has determined is a Superior Proposal. ECU will have the 
right, but not the obligation, to amend the terms of the Arrangement upon notification by Golden of a Superior Proposal or 
Intervening  Event,  as  applicable,  within  a  five  (5)  Business  Day  response  period.  Within  five  (5)  Business  Days  of
- 78 -

receiving any such proposal by ECU to amend the terms of the Arrangement, the Golden Board shall review and determine 
whether the Acquisition Proposal to which ECU is responding would continue to be a Superior Proposal, or whether the 
Adverse Recommendation Change is still necessary, when assessed in light of the Arrangement Agreement and the Plan of 
Arrangement as they are proposed by ECU to be amended. If the Golden Board determines that, in light of the proposed 
amendment by ECU, the Acquisition Proposal to which ECU is responding would not continue to be a Superior Proposal, 
or the Adverse Recommendation Change would not be necessary, Golden is required to enter into an amendment to the 
Arrangement  Agreement  to  give  effect  to  such  amendments  and  the  Golden  Board  must  promptly  reaffirm  its 
recommendation of the Plan of Arrangement.

to occur by such Outside Date;

Acquisition Proposal beyond a period of five (5) Business Days (or beyond the Business Day

(a)
(b)
(c)
ECU and Golden may amend, modify or supplement the Plan of Arrangement at any time prior to the

following the Meeting, approved by the Court and communicated to ECU Securityholders in the manner 
required by the Court (if so required);
ECU may propose to amend, modify or supplement the Plan of Arrangement at any time prior to or at the 
Meeting, provided that Golden has consented to such amendment, modification or supplement, with or 
without  any  other  prior  notice  or  communication  and,  if  so  proposed  and  accepted  by  the  ECU 
Securityholders voting at the Meeting, such amendment, modification or supplement shall become part of

any amendment, modification or supplement to the Plan of Arrangement that is approved by the Court 
following the Meeting shall be effective only if it is consented to in writing by ECU and Golden and, if

RISK FACTORS
In assessing the Arrangement, ECU Securityholders should carefully consider the risks described in the Golden Annual 
Report and the ECU AIF, each of which is incorporated by reference in this Circular and is filed on SEDAR, together 
with  the  other  information  contained  in  or  incorporated  by  reference  into  this  Circular.    Additional  risks  and 
uncertainties, including those currently unknown to or considered to be not material by ECU, may also adversely affect 
the business of the Combined Company or any one or more of Golden, ECU and the Combined Company.  Risks related 
to Golden are set out under “Information Concerning Golden – Risk Factors Related to Golden” in this Circular.  No 
relative weight or importance has been assigned to the following risk factors, and no meaning should be inferred from 
the order in which the risk factors have been presented in this Circular.
The Arrangement and the operations of the Combined Company are subject to certain risks including the following:
Risks Related to the Arrangement
The Exchange Ratio is fixed and, as a result, the Golden Stock issued on closing of the Arrangement may have a market 
value different than at the time of announcement of the Arrangement.
Pursuant  to  the  Arrangement,  each  ECU  Shareholder  will  be  entitled  to  receive  0.05  shares  of  Golden  Stock  and 
Cdn$0.000394 in cash for each ECU Share held. The Exchange Ratio will not be adjusted to reflect any changes in the 
market  value  of  Golden  Stock  or  the  ECU  Shares  at  the  Effective  Time.  The  market  value  of  the  Golden  Stock  at  the 
Effective Time may vary significantly from the market value of the Golden Stock immediately prior to the announcement 
of  the  Arrangement  and  at  the  date  of  this  Circular.  If  the  market  value  of  Golden  Stock  declines,  the  value  of  the 
consideration  received  by  ECU  Securityholders  will  decline  as  well.  Variations  may  occur  as  a  result  of  changes  in,  or 
market  perceptions  of  changes  in,  the  business,  operations  or  prospects  of  Golden,  ECU  and  the  Combined  Company,

regulatory considerations, general market and economic conditions, changes in metal prices and other factors over which 
neither ECU nor Golden has control.
The Completion of the Arrangement is subject to several conditions that must be satisfied or waived.
Completion of the Arrangement is conditional upon certain conditions being satisfied or waived.  There can be no certainty 
that these conditions will be satisfied or waived.
In  addition,  the  Arrangement  is  conditional  on  receiving  certain  third  party  approvals  or  consents  that  are  beyond  the 
control of ECU or Golden, including, but not limited to, ECU Securityholder approval, Golden Stockholder approval, TSX 
approval of the listing of the Golden Stock and Golden Replacement February 2009 Warrants to be issued in connection 
with  the  Arrangement,  NYSE  Amex  approval  of  the  listing  of  the  Golden  Stock  to  be  issued  in  connection  with  the 
Arrangmement, and other third party approvals and consents.
If for any reason the conditions to the Arrangement are not satisfied or waived and the Arrangement is not completed, the 
market price of ECU Shares may be adversely affected.
The Arrangement Agreement may be terminated by ECU or Golden in certain circumstances, in which case the market 
price for ECU Shares may be adversely affected.
Each of ECU and Golden has the right to terminate the Arrangement  Agreement in certain circumstances. Accordingly, 
there  is  no  certainty  that  the  Arrangement  Agreement  will  not  be  terminated  by  either  ECU  or  Golden  before  the 
completion of the Arrangement.
If the Arrangement Agreement is terminated, there is no assurance that the ECU Board will be able to find a party willing to 
pay  an  equivalent  or  a  more  attractive  price  for  ECU  Shares  than  the  price  to  be  paid  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  the 
Arrangement Agreement.
If the Arrangement Agreement is terminated, ECU will need to raise money to refinance existing indebtedness and fund 
operations. There is no assurance that ECU will be able to arrange financing on attractive terms or at all.
The Combined Company will incur significant transaction, combination-related and restructuring costs in connection 
with the Arrangement.
Golden and ECU expect to incur transaction fees and other expenses related to the Arrangement totalling approximately 
US$12.0 million, including financial advisors’ fees, filing fees, legal and accounting fees, soliciting fees, regulatory fees 
and  mailing  costs.    ECU  expects  to  incur  costs  for  executive  bonuses  and  change  of  control  payments  related  to  the 
Arrangement  totalling  approximately  Cdn$4.0  million  (some  of  which  are  expected  to  be  paid  in  Golden  Stock).    The 
Combined Company also expects to incur significant costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies. 
It is difficult to predict the amount of these costs before the integration process begins.  The Combined Company may incur 
additional unanticipated costs as a consequence of difficulties arising from efforts to integrate the operations of the two 
companies. Although ECU expects that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies 
related to the integration of the businesses, can offset incremental transaction, combination-related and restructuring costs 
over time, ECU cannot assure that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term, or at all.
The  Combined  Company  may  incur  significant  costs  related  to  contractual  arrangements  that  are  not  currently 
anticipated.
The Combined Company may incur significant costs related to contractual arrangements that are not currently anticipated.  
For  example,  if  the  Arrangement  is  completed,  under  certain  circumstances  ECU’s  term  loan  lender  may  terminate  its 
contractual arrangements with ECU.  Although ECU is attempting to obtain the consent of ECU’s term loan lender to the 
Arrangement, ECU may not be successful in these efforts. If the Arrangement is completed without the consent of ECU’s 
term loan lender, the Combined Company may be required, in certain circumstances, to immediately repay the full amount 
borrowed under the term loan facility (expected to be approximately US$16.0 million on the Effective Date), plus certain 
other amounts.  There may be other agreements with similar provisions, contracts with respect to which there are disputes

if you have any questions, or require assistance completing your Proxy.
and contractual obligations of which management is not currently aware, any of which could impose unanticipated costs on 
the  Combined  Company  following  completion  of  the  Arrangement.    If  these  events  were  to  occur,  the  additional 
expenditures  in  connection  with  repayment  of  the  term  loan  or  other  unanticipated  costs  would  significantly  reduce  the 
amount  of  cash  currently  expected  to  be  available  for  deployment  at  the  El  Quevar  Project,  the  Velardeña  District 
Properties, or other properties in the Combined Company’s exploration portfolio on the schedule currently anticipated.
The exercise of Dissent Rights may increase the Consideration payable pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement or hinder 
the closing of the Arrangement.
The  exercise  of  Dissent  Rights  by  Registered  Shareholders  may  increase  the  Consideration  payable  to  such  Registered 
Shareholders. While Golden and ECU believe that the value of the Consideration to be paid to ECU Shareholders pursuant 
to the Arrangement is equal to or exceeds the fair value of the ECU Shares, there can be no assurance that a court would 
agree  with  this  assessment  and  consequently  the  amount  any  Dissenting  Shareholders  receive  could  be  higher  than  the 
Consideration to which those Registered Shareholders would have been entitled under the Arrangement Agreement.
Furthermore, if more than 5% of the Registered Shareholders exercise Dissent Rights, Golden has the option to not proceed 
with the Arrangement.
The directors and officers of ECU may have interests that are different from the interests of other ECU Securityholders.
ECU  will  make  bonus  payments  for  successful  completion  of  the  Arrangement  to  certain  of  its  officers  totalling 
approximately Cdn$3.3 million (some of which are expected to be paid in Golden Stock) and severance payments shall be 
made  to  certain  of  its  officers  upon  closing  the  Arrangement  totalling  approximately  Cdn$0.7 million.    See  “The 
Arrangement – Interests of Directors and Officers of ECU in the Arrangement”.
These  payments  and  potential  benefits  give  the  directors  and  management  of  ECU  an  interest  in  the  Arrangement  that 
differs from the interest of other ECU Securityholders.
The trading price of Golden Stock could be depressed by sales of shares of Golden Stock by ECU Securityholders or 
Golden Stockholders who sell their shares of Golden Stock.
Some ECU Securityholders may intend not to hold Golden Stock and some Golden Stockholders may decide to sell their 
shares of Golden Stock following the Arrangement, particularly if the market reaction to the Arrangement is not favourable. 
If a significant number of Golden Stockholders or former ECU Securityholders seek to sell their shares of Golden Stock 
following completion of the Arrangement, the trading price of Golden Stock may be adversely affected.  A decrease in the 
trading price of the Golden Stock could impair the Combined Company’s ability to raise capital through future sales of 
common stock.
The existence of a significant number of options and warrants may have a negative effect on the market price of Golden 
Stock.
ECU currently has outstanding ECU Options and ECU Warrants to purchase ECU Shares, which will, in the Arrangement, 
be  replaced  by  the  Golden  Replacement  Options  and  Golden  Replacement  Warrants  to  purchase  Golden  Stock.    The 
Golden  Replacement  Options  will  consist  of  employee  options  to  purchase  661,750  shares  of  Golden  Stock  at  exercise 
prices ranging from Cdn$16.00 to Cdn$31.80, and expiring between September 2011 and October 2014, and the Golden 
Replacement  December  2009  Warrants  and  Golden  Replacement  February  2009  Warrants  will  consist  of  warrants  to 
purchase  386,363  and  1,831,929  shares  of  Golden  Stock,  respectively,  at  exercise  prices  of  Cdn$18.00  and  Cdn$19.00, 
respectively, expiring in December 2011 and February 2014, respectively.  The existence of securities available for exercise 
and resale is referred to as an “overhang”, and, particularly if such options and warrants are “in the money”, the anticipation 
of potential sales could exert downward pressure on the market price of Golden Stock.

The  ECU  Termination  Fee  provided  for  under  the  Arrangement  Agreement  may  discourage  other  parties  from 
attempting to acquire ECU. If ECU is required to pay the ECU Termination Fee and an alternative transaction is not 
completed, ECU’s financial condition will be materially adversely affected.
Under the Arrangement Agreement, ECU is required to pay the ECU Termination Fee in the event that the Arrangement is 
terminated in certain circumstances related to a possible alternative transaction to the Arrangement.  The ECU Termination 
Fee  may discourage other parties  from attempting to acquire the ECU Shares, even if those parties  would otherwise be 
willing to offer greater value to ECU Shareholders than that offered by Golden under the Arrangement. Moreover, if ECU 
is required to pay the ECU Termination Fee under the Arrangement Agreement and ECU does not enter into or complete an 
alternative transaction, ECU’s financial condition will be materially adversely affected.  See “The Arrangement Agreement 
– Termination of the Arrangement Agreement” in this Circular. Additionally, ECU will still have a Cdn$15 million debt 
owing to Golden pursuant to the ECU Convertible Notes.
If  ECU  is  required  to  pay  the  expense  reimbursement  fee  contemplated  by  the  Arrangement  Agreement  in  certain 
circumstances, ECU’s financial condition will be materially adversely affected.
If the Arrangement Agreement is terminated by Golden as a result of a breach of any representation or warranty or failure 
to perform a covenant by ECU that would cause any of the conditions precedent in favour of Golden not to be satisfied, or
if the Meeting has not occurred by the date provided for in the Arrangment Agreement, ECU shall be required to pay to 
Golden Cdn$2,500,000 in respect of the fees, costs and expenses incurred by Golden in connection with the transactions 
contemplated  by  the  Arrangement  Agreement  and  the  Plan  of  Arrangement.    If  ECU  is  required  to  pay  such  expense 
reimbursement to Golden, in circumstances where ECU has not entered into an alternative transaction to the Arrangement, 
ECU’s financial condition will be materially adversely affected. Additionally, ECU will still have a Cdn$15 million debt 
owing to Golden pursuant to the ECU Convertible Notes.
Risks Related to the Operations of the Combined Company
After the completion of the Arrangement, the business of the Combined Company, as well as the price of Golden Stock, 
will be subject to numerous risks currently affecting the businesses of Golden and ECU.
The Arrangement will present challenges associated with integrating operations, personnel and other aspects of ECU 
and Golden.
The Arrangement will subject ECU to any environmental, contractual or other obligations and liabilities of Golden, some of 
which  may  be  unknown  to  management  of  ECU.  While  ECU  and  its  legal  and  financial  advisors  have  conducted  due 
diligence  on  Golden  and  its  business,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  ECU  is  aware  of  all  obligations  and  liabilities  of 
Golden. These liabilities, and any additional risks and uncertainties related to Golden’s business and to the Arrangement 
not currently known to ECU or that ECU may currently be aware of, but that prove to be more significant than assessed or 
estimated  by  ECU,  could  negatively  impact  the  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  of  the  Combined 
Company following consummation of the Arrangement.
In  addition,  the  results  of  the  Combined  Company  following  the  Arrangement  will  depend  in  part  upon  the  Combined 
Company’s  ability  to  integrate  the  businesses  of  ECU  and  Golden  in  an  efficient  and  effective  manner.  The  attempt  to 
integrate  two  companies  that  have  previously  operated  independently  may  result  in  significant  challenges,  and  the
Combined Company may be unable to accomplish the integration smoothly or successfully. In particular, the necessity of 
coordinating  geographically  dispersed  organizations  and  addressing  possible  differences  in  corporate  cultures  and 
management  philosophies  may  increase  the  difficulties  of  integration.  ECU  has  operated  as  a  Québec  corporation,  with 
substantially all of its personnel and operations in Mexico, and Golden has not previously conducted mining operations in 
Mexico. The integration will require the dedication of significant management resources, which may temporarily distract 
management’s  attention  from  the  day-to-day  operations  of  the  businesses  of  the  Combined  Company.  In  addition,  the 
Combined Company may adjust the way in which ECU has conducted its operations and utilized its properties, which may 
require  retraining  and  development  of  new  procedures  and  methodologies.  The  process  of  integrating  operations  and 
making such adjustments after the Arrangement could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of 
one or more of the Combined Company’s businesses and the loss of key personnel. Employee uncertainty, lack of focus or

turnover  during  the  integration  process  may  also  disrupt  the  businesses  of  the  Combined  Company.  Any  inability  of 
management  to  integrate  the  operations  of  Golden  and  ECU  successfully  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the 
business and financial condition of the Combined Company.
ECU and Golden have both historically incurred operating losses and operating cash flow deficits and it is expected that 
the Combined Company will continue to incur operating losses in the foreseeable future.
ECU and Golden have a history of operating losses and it is expected that the Combined Company will continue to incur 
operating losses unless and until such time as ECU’s Velardeña Properties in Central Mexico, Golden’s El Quevar Project 
in  Argentina,  or  another  of  the  exploration  properties  generates  sufficient  revenue  to  fund  continuing  operations  of  the 
Combined  Company.  None  of  Golden’s  properties  is  currently  in  commercial  production.    While  ECU  is  currently  in 
production at its Velardeña District Properties, ECU is still considered to be a development stage company, as ECU has not 
determined that a sufficient portion of its  mineral resources are economically exploitable and, accordingly, ECU has no 
mineral reserves.  It is not expected that revenues generated by production at ECU’s properties will exceed the expenses of 
the Combined Company for at least the next few years. It is expected that the Combined Company’s operating expenses, 
capital  expenditures  and  other  expenses  will  increase  in  future  years  as  it  advances  exploration,  development  and 
commercial production of the Combined Company’s properties and any other properties that it may acquire. The amounts 
and timing of expenditures will depend on the progress of efforts to expand production at the Velardeña District Properties, 
advance the El Quevar Project and continue exploration at these and other properties, the results of consultants’ analyses 
and recommendations, the rate at which operating losses are incurred, the execution of any joint venture agreements with 
strategic  partners,  if  any,  and  potential  future  acquisition  of  additional  properties,  in  addition  to  other  factors,  many  of 
which  will  be  beyond  control  of  management.  It  is  expected  that  the  advancement  or  development  of  the  Combined 
Company’s properties and any other properties it may acquire will require the commitment of substantial resources. There 
can be no assurance that the Combined Company will continue to generate revenues or will ever achieve profitability.
ECU’s and Golden’s properties may not contain mineral reserves.
None of the El Quevar Project, the Velardeña District Properties or any of Golden’s or ECU’s other properties, has been 
shown  to  contain  proven  or  probable  mineral  reserves.  Expenditures  made  in  the  exploration  and  advancement  of  the 
properties of the Combined Company may not result in discoveries of commercially recoverable quantities of ore. Most 
exploration projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable ore deposits and there is no assurance that any 
mineral deposit identified will qualify as an ore body that can be legally and economically exploited or that any particular 
level of recovery of silver from discovered mineralization will in fact be realized.
MICON has completed technical reports on Golden’s El Quevar Property, which indicated the presence of indicated and 
inferred resources and on ECU’s Velardeña District Properties, which indicated the presence of measured, indicated and 
inferred resources.  Measured, indicated and inferred resource figures based on estimates made by geologists are inherently 
imprecise  and  depend  on  geological  interpretation  and  statistical  inferences  drawn  from  drilling  and  sampling  that  may 
prove to be unreliable or inaccurate. There is no assurance that these estimates will be accurate or that proven and probable 
mineral  reserves  will  be  identified  at  the  El  Quevar  Property,  the  Velardeña  District  Properties  or  any  of  Golden’s  and 
ECU’s other properties.  Even if the presence of reserves is established at a project, the economic viability of the project 
may  not  justify  exploitation.  Management  of  the  Combined  Company  plans  to  spend  significant  amounts  on  the 
advancement  of  the  El  Quevar  Project  and  the  expansion  of  the  Velardeña  District  Properties  prior  to  establishing  the 
economic viability of the project in a technical report compliant with NI 43-101.
Estimates  of  reserves,  mineral  deposits  and  production  costs  can  also  be  affected  by  such  factors  as  governmental 
regulations and requirements, fluctuations in metals prices or costs of essential materials or supplies, environmental factors, 
unforeseen technical difficulties and unusual or unexpected geological formations. In addition, the grade of ore ultimately 
mined  may  differ  from  that  indicated  by  drilling  results,  sampling,  feasibility  studies  or  technical  reports.    Short-term 
factors relating to reserves, such as the need for orderly development of ore bodies or the processing of new or different 
grades,  may also have an adverse effect on  mining operations and on the results of operations. Silver or other  minerals 
recovered in small scale laboratory tests may not be duplicated in large scale tests under on-site production conditions.

The  Combined  Company  is  expected  to  continue  to  require  substantial  external  financing  to  pay  its  operating  and 
general and administrative expenses, continue the advancement of the Velardeña Property expansion and the El Quevar 
Project and fund its other exploration activities.
The  Combined  Company  will  be  required  to  continue  to  raise  substantial  funds  from  external  sources  in  order  to  pay 
operating and general and administrative expenses, advance the Velardeña Property expansion and the El Quevar Project, 
maintain other exploration properties and continue exploration activities, as it is not expected that cash generated by the 
Velardeña  mining  operations  will  be  sufficient  to  fund  these  activities.    If  the  Velardeña  Property  expansion  or  the  El 
Quevar Project proceeds to development and construction, it is anticipated that the Combined Company would need to raise 
additional  capital  during  2011.    The  size  and  capital  cost  for  the  Velardeña  Property  expansion  or  a  possible  mine  and 
processing  facilities  at  the  El  Quevar  Project  have  not  been  determined  and  would  depend,  among  other  things,  on  the 
results of ongoing efforts to further define the Yaxtché deposit.  There is no credit agreement in place that would finance 
development of either the Velardeña Property expansion or the El Quevar Project, and securing credit for these projects 
may be difficult  given Golden’s limited history and the continuing  volatility in global credit markets.   Access to public 
financing  has  been  negatively  impacted  by  the  volatility  in  the  credit  markets,  which  may  impact  the  ability  of  the 
Combined Company to obtain equity or debt financing in the future and, if obtained, to do so on favourable terms.  There 
can be no assurance that the Combined Company will be able to obtain the necessary financing for the Velardeña Property 
expansion or the El Quevar Project on favourable terms or at all. Failure to obtain sufficient financing may also result in the 
delay or indefinite postponement of exploration activities at other properties.
The Combined Company will be subject to a broad range of Environmental Laws and associated costs and liabilities.
ECU and Golden are subject to a broad range of Environmental Laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which they 
operate.  These  Laws  and  regulations,  as  interpreted  by  relevant  agencies  and  the  courts,  impose  increasingly  stringent 
environmental  protection  standards  regarding,  among  other  things,  air  emissions,  wastewater  storage,  treatment  and 
discharges,  the  use  and  handling  of  hazardous  or  toxic  materials,  waste  disposal  practices  and  the  remediation  of 
environmental  contamination.  The  costs  of  complying  with  these  Laws  and  regulations,  including  participation  in 
assessments and remediation  of sites, could be significant. In addition, these standards  can create the risk of substantial 
environmental liabilities, including liabilities associated with divested assets and past activities.
The existence of secured indebtedness at ECU may limit the flexibility of the Combined Company to obtain additional 
financing and pursue certain opportunities.
Prior  to  the  Arrangement,  Golden  had  no  indebtedness.  At  June  30,  2011,  ECU  had  approximately  US$17.0  million  of 
outstanding  term  loan  indebtedness,  bearing  interest  at  an  effective  rate  of  12.8%  and  requiring  30  monthly  principal 
repayments  of  $553,951,  commencing  July  31,  2011  through  maturity  on  December  31,  2013. The  presence  of  secured 
indebtedness,  particularly  in  a  company  with  limited  revenues,  has  important  consequences  to  the  Combined  Company, 
including  (i)  making  it  more  difficult  to  obtain  additional  financing,  (ii)  subjecting  it  to  the  risk  that  its  assets  may  be 
foreclosed  upon  if  it  is  unable  to  make  required  principal  and  interest  payments,  (iii)  reducing  cash  flows  available  for
development of properties, and (iv) making the Combined Company more vulnerable than competitors without debt to a 
downturn in business, the economy or commodity prices.  The Combined Company’s ability to service its debt will depend 
on its operating performance, which is affected by prevailing economic conditions that are outside of its control.  If it is 
unable to support debt service from revenues from ECU’s mining operations, the Combined Company may be forced to 
divert resources from the development of its other properties, which may have material adverse effects on its growth and 
future prospects.
The long-term cash flow and profitability of the Combined Company will be affected by changes in the prices of silver 
and other metals.
The ability of the Combined Company to establish reserves and develop its exploration properties, and its profitability and 
long-term  viability,  depend,  in  large  part,  on  the  market  prices  of  silver,  zinc,  lead,  gold,  copper  and  other  metals.  The 
market prices for these metals are volatile and are affected by numerous factors beyond the Combined Company’s control, 
including:
!
global or regional consumption patterns;

!
supply of, and demand for, silver, gold, zinc, lead, copper and other metals;
speculative activities and producer hedging activities;
expectations for inflation;
political and economic conditions; and
supply of, and demand for, consumables required for production.
Future weakness in the global economy could increase volatility in metals prices or depress metals prices, which could in 
turn  reduce  the  cash  flow  generated  by  the  Velardeña  District  Properties,  or  make  it  uneconomical  for  the  Combined 
Company to continue its mining or exploration activities. Volatility or sustained price declines may also adversely affect 
the ability of the Combined Company to build its business.
If  the Combined  Company  is  unable  to  obtain  all  of  its  required  governmental  permits  or  obtain  property  rights  on 
favourable terms or at all, its operations could be negatively impacted.
Future  operations  of  the  Combined  Company,  including  the  new  tailings  facility  at  and  potential  expansion  of  the
Velardeña District Properties, the advancement of the El Quevar Project, and other exploration and potential development 
activities, will require additional permits from various governmental authorities.  Operations of the Combined Company are 
and  will  continue  to  be  governed  by  Laws  and  regulations  governing  prospecting,  development,  mining,  production, 
exports, taxes, labour standards, occupational health, waste disposal, toxic substances, land use, environmental protection, 
mine safety, mining royalties and other matters.  The Combined Company may also be required to obtain certain property 
rights  to  access  or  use  its  properties.  Obtaining  or  renewing  licenses  and  permits,  and  acquiring  property  rights,  can  be 
complex and time-consuming processes.  There can be no assurance that the Combined Company will be able to acquire all 
required licenses, permits or property rights on reasonable terms or in a timely manner, or at all, and that such terms will 
not be adversely changed, that required extensions will be granted, or that the issuance of such licenses, permits or property 
rights will not be challenged by third parties. Delays in obtaining or a failure to obtain any licenses, permits or property 
rights or any required extensions; challenges to the issuance of licenses, permits or property rights, whether successful or 
unsuccessful;  changes  to  the  terms  of  licenses,  permits  or  property  rights;  or  a  failure  to  comply  with  the  terms  of  any 
licenses, permits or property  rights that  have been obtained, could have a material adverse effect on the business of the 
Combined Company by delaying or preventing continued operations or by or making continued operations economically 
unfeasible.
The Combined Company may not meet key production or cost estimates.
The  level  of  production  and  capital  and  operating  costs  estimates  relating  to  development  projects,  which  are  used  in 
establishing mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates for obtaining financing and other purposes, are based on certain 
assumptions  and  are  inherently  subject  to  significant  uncertainty.    Actual  results  for  the  Combined  Company’s  projects 
could  differ  from  current  estimates  and  assumptions,  and  these  differences  may  be  material.    In  addition,  development 
activities or processing operations  may identify  new or unexpected conditions  which could reduce production below, or 
increase capital or operating costs above, current estimates. If actual results are less favourable than currently estimated, the 
results of operations, profitability and financial results of the Combined Company could be materially adversely affected.
RIGHTS OF DISSENTING SHAREHOLDERS
ECU  Shareholders  who  wish  to  dissent  should  take  note  that  strict  compliance  with  the  Dissent  Procedures  is 
required.
The  following  description  of  the  Dissent  Procedures  is  not  a  comprehensive  statement  of  the  procedures  to  be 
followed by a Dissenting Shareholder and is qualified entirely by reference to the full text of the Interim Order and 
the Plan of Arrangement. The Interim Order, which is attached to this Circular as Appendix E, expressly provides 
Registered Shareholders with the Dissent Rights in respect of the Arrangement on substantially the same terms and 
conditions as set out in Chapter XIV—Right to Demand Repurchase of Shares (sections 372 to 397) of the QBCA, 
the  text  of  which  is  reproduced  in  Appendix  G  to  this  Circular,  with  modifications  to  the  provisions  of  such 
sections 372 to 397 in accordance with the Interim Order and Article 5 of the Plan of Arrangement.

Dissent Rights
Any  Registered  Shareholder  as  of  the  Record  Date  who  exercises  Dissent  Rights  with  respect  to  the  Arrangement  in 
compliance  with  Chapter  XIV  of  the  QBCA  (as  modified  by  the  Interim  Order  and  the  Plan  of  Arrangement)  will  be 
entitled, in the event that the Arrangement becomes effective, to be paid by Golden the fair value of the ECU Shares held 
by  that  Dissenting  Shareholder  determined  as  of  the  close  of  the  offices  of  ECU  on  the  day  before  the  Arrangement 
Resolution  is  approved  and  adopted  by  the  ECU  Securityholders  at  the  Meeting.  The  Interim  Order  and  the  Plan  of 
Arrangement provide that the fair value payable by Golden to a Dissenting Shareholder, may, at the option of Golden, be 
paid by way of issuance of shares of Golden Stock.
No ECU Optionholder, ECU Warrantholder or ECU Convertible Noteholder shall be entitled to Dissent Rights in respect of 
such holder’s ECU Options, ECU Warrants or ECU Convertible Notes.
Registered  Shareholders  who  renounce,  or  are  deemed  to  renounce,  their  right  to  demand  the  repurchase  of  their  ECU 
Shares pursuant to the Dissent Rights shall be deemed to have participated in the Arrangement, as of the Effective Time, 
and shall be entitled to receive the Consideration to which ECU Shareholders who have not exercised Dissent Rights are 
entitled under the Plan of Arrangement.  For greater certainty, in addition to any other restrictions in Chapter XIV of the 
QBCA, no ECU Shareholder who has failed to exercise all the voting rights carried by the ECU Shares held by such ECU 
Shareholder  against  the  Arrangement  Resolution  shall  be  entitled  to  exercise  Dissent  Rights  with  respect  to  the 
Arrangement.
Without  limiting  the  generality  of  the  other  provisions  in  this  Circular  describing  the  Dissent  Rights  and  the  exercise 
thereof, a Dissenting  Shareholder  will, at the Effective Time, and  notwithstanding any provision of  Chapter XIV of the 
QBCA,  be  deemed  to  have  directly  transferred  and  assigned  each  ECU  Share  held  by  such  Dissenting  Shareholder  to 
Golden (free and clear of all Liens) and such Dissenting Shareholder shall cease to be the holder of such ECU Shares and to 
have any rights as a holder or former holder of such ECU Shares other than the right to be paid the fair value for such ECU 
Shares by Golden in accordance with its Dissent Rights in accordance with the provisions of the QBCA as modified by the 
Interim Order and the Plan of Arrangement. In no case shall Golden, ECU or any other person be required to recognize any 
holder of ECU Shares who exercises Dissent Rights as a holder of ECU Shares after the Effective Time.
If the Arrangement is not implemented for any reason, Dissenting Shareholders will not be entitled to be paid the fair value 
for their ECU Shares under the Dissent Rights, and their ECU Shares will not be deemed to be transferred to Golden.
Dissent Procedures
Notice of Exercise of Dissent Rights
A Registered Shareholder as of the Record Date who wishes to exercise Dissent Rights must deliver a written notice of 
intent to exercise the right to demand the repurchase of ECU Shares contemplated by Section 376 of the QBCA (“Notice of 
Exercise of Dissent Rights”) which must be received by ECU not later than 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on August 26, 2011, 
or two Business Days prior to the reconvening of any adjournment or postponement of the Meeting.  ECU’s address for 
such purpose is its registered office at 1116 ave. Granada, Rouyn-Noranda, Québec J9Y 1G9.  A Dissenting Shareholder 
must dissent  with respect to  all ECU Shares  in  which the holder holds a beneficial  interest.  The Notice of Exercise of 
Dissent Rights must set out:
(i)
(j)
the full number of ECU Shares held by the Registered Shareholder; and
if the Registered Shareholder delivering the Notice of Exercise of Dissent Rights is acting on the instruction of a 
Beneficial Shareholder, the identity of the Beneficial Shareholder who intends to demand a repurchase of its ECU 
Shares and the number of such ECU Shares.
The giving of a Notice of Exercise of Dissent Rights does not deprive a Dissenting Shareholder of the right to vote the ECU 
Shares for which such notice was given. A vote either in person or by proxy against the Arrangement Resolution does not 
constitute a Notice of Exercise of Dissent Rights. However, should any ECU Shares of a Dissenting Shareholder not be 
voted against the Arrangement Resolution, or should a Dissenting Shareholder abstain from voting any its ECU Shares in

respect of the Arrangement Resolution, the Dissent Rights of such Dissenting Shareholder will be terminated with respect 
to all of its ECU Shares.
Terms of Repurchase of Dissenting Shareholders’ ECU Shares
Promptly  after  the  Effective  Time,  Golden  is  required  to  give  notice  (the  “Repurchase  Notice”)  to  each  Dissenting 
Shareholder, which notice shall mention (i) the repurchase price being offered for the ECU Shares held by all Dissenting 
Shareholders and an explanation of how such price was determined and (ii) whether Golden intends to pay such repurchase 
price by way of issuance of shares of Golden Stock or by cash payment or by some combination of the two. Within 30 days 
after  receiving  the  Repurchase  Notice,  each  Dissenting  Shareholder  is  required,  if  the  Dissenting  Shareholder  wishes  to 
proceed with exercising its Dissent Rights, to deliver to Golden a written statement:
(a)
(b)
confirming that the Dissenting Shareholder wishes to exercise its Dissent Rights and have all of its ECU Shares 
repurchased  at  the  repurchase  price  indicated  in  the  Repurchase  Notice  (in  such  case,  a  “Notice  of 
Confirmation”); or
that the Dissenting Shareholder contests the repurchase price indicated in the Repurchase Notice and demands an 
increase in the repurchase price offered (in such case, a “Notice of Contestation”).
Additionally, if it has not been done previously, all certificate(s) representing the ECU Shares pursuant to which the Dissent 
Rights were exercised, together with the completed and executed applicable Letter of Transmittal, should be delivered with 
the Notice of Confirmation or the Notice of Contestation.
A Dissenting Shareholder who fails to send Golden, within the required timeframe, a Notice of Confirmation or a Notice of 
Contestation,  shall  be  deemed  to  have  renounced  its  Dissent  Rights  and  will  be  deemed  to  have  participated  in  the 
Arrangement on the same basis as ECU Shareholders who did not exercise Dissent Rights.
Upon  receiving  a  Notice  of  Confirmation  within  the  required  timeframe,  Golden  shall  pay  the  Dissenting  Shareholder, 
within 10 days of receiving the confirmation, the repurchase price indicated in the Repurchase Notice for all of its ECU 
Shares.
Upon receiving a Notice of Contestation within the required timeframe, Golden may propose an increased repurchase price 
within  30  days  of  receiving  the  contestation,  which  increased  repurchase  price  must  be  the  same  for  all  Dissenting 
Shareholders who duly submitted a Notice of Contestation.  If (a) Golden does not follow up on a Dissenting Shareholder’s
contestation within 30 days after receiving its Notice of Contestation or (b) the Dissenting Shareholder contests the increase 
in the repurchase price offered by Golden, such Dissenting Shareholder may ask the Court to determine the increase in the 
repurchase price.  However, any such application to the Court must be made within 90 days after receiving the Repurchase 
Notice. As soon as any such application is filed with the Court by any Dissenting Shareholder, Golden must notify this fact 
(a “Notice of Application”) to all the other Dissenting Shareholders who are still contesting the repurchase price, or the 
increase in the repurchase price, offered by Golden.
All Dissenting Shareholders who received the Notice of Application are bound by the judgment of the Court hearing the 
application as to the fair value of the ECU Shares (which Court may entrust the appraisal of the fair value to an expert). 
Within 10 days after the Court judgement, Golden must pay the repurchase price determined by the Court to all Dissenting 
Shareholders  who  received  the  Notice  of  Application,  and  pay  the  increase  in  the  repurchase  price  to  all  Dissenting 
Shareholders who submitted a Notice of Contestation but did not contest the increase in the repurchase price offered by 
Golden.  However, if Golden is unable to pay the full increase in the repurchase price because there are reasonable grounds 
for believing that it is or would be unable to pay its liabilities as they become due,  Golden would only be required to pay 
the maximum amount it may legally pay the relevant Dissenting Shareholder. In such a case, such Dissenting Shareholders 
remain creditors of Golden for the unpaid balance of the repurchase price and are entitled to be paid as soon as Golden is 
legally able to do so or, in the event of the liquidation of Golden, are entitled to be collocated after the other creditors but by 
preference over the other shareholders of Golden.

Beneficial Shareholders
Persons who are Beneficial Shareholders of ECU Shares registered in the name of an Intermediary, custodian, nominee or 
in some other name, who wish to exercise Dissent Rights should be aware that only the Registered Shareholder as of the 
Record  Date  is  entitled  to  exercise  Dissent  Rights.    A  Beneficial  Shareholder  may  give  instructions  to  the  Registered 
Shareholder  in  whose  name  the  ECU  Shares  over  which  it  has  a  beneficial  interest  are  registered  as  to  the  exercise  of 
Dissent Rights attaching to its ECU Shares.  The Registered Shareholder must inform ECU of the identity of the Beneficial 
Shareholder who intends to exercise Dissent Rights, and of the number of ECU Shares over which the Dissent Rights are 
being exercised, within the prescribed period for giving a Notice of Exercise of Dissent Rights (see “Rights of Dissenting 
Shareholders  –  Dissent  Procedures”  above).    A  Registered  Shareholder  who  demands  the  repurchase  of  ECU  Shares 
pursuant to Dissent Rights in accordance with the instructions of a Beneficial Shareholder may demand the repurchase of 
part of the ECU Shares to which such Dissent Rights are attached.
A Beneficial Shareholder who wishes to exercise Dissent Rights should communicate with the Intermediary, custodian or 
nominee in whose name the ECU Shares over which it has a beneficial interest are registered as of the Record Date as to the 
procedure for instructing such Registered Shareholder to exercise the Dissent Rights on the Beneficial Shareholder’s behalf.
Note that sections 393 to 397 of the QBCA, the text of which is included in Appendix G to this Circular, set forth special 
provisions which must be followed with respect to the exercise of Dissent Rights by Beneficial Shareholders.
The discussion above is only a summary of the Dissent Procedures  which are technical procedures and are complex. A 
Registered Shareholder who intends to exercise Dissent Rights should carefully consider and comply with the provisions of 
Chapter XIV of the QBCA, as modified by the Interim Order and the Plan of Arrangement. It is suggested that any ECU 
Shareholder wishing to avail itself of Dissent Rights seek its own legal advice as failure to comply strictly with the 
applicable provisions of the QBCA, the Interim Order and the Plan of Arrangement may prejudice the availability 
of Dissent Rights. Dissenting Shareholders should note that the exercise of Dissent Rights can be a complex, time 
consuming and expensive process.
CERTAIN CANADIAN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS
The  following  summary  fairly  describes,  as  of  the  date  of  this  Circular,  the  principal  Canadian  federal  income  tax 
considerations under the Tax Act relating to the Arrangement generally applicable to an ECU Securityholder who, at all 
relevant times, for the purposes of the Tax Act: (i) deals at arm’s length with ECU and Golden; (ii) is not affiliated with 
ECU or Golden; and (iii) holds ECU Securities, and will hold all Golden Securities acquired on the Arrangement, as capital 
property (each such securityholder in this section, a “Holder”). A Holder’s ECU Securities and Golden Securities generally 
will be considered to be capital property of the Holder unless the Holder holds such securities in the course of carrying on a 
business  of  buying  and  selling  securities  or  acquired  such  securities  in  a  transaction  considered  to  be  an  adventure  or 
concern in the nature of trade. Certain Holders who are residents of Canada for the purposes of the Tax Act and whose ECU 
Shares might not otherwise be capital property may, in certain circumstances, be entitled to make an irrevocable election 
under subsection 39(4) of the Tax Act to have the ECU Shares and every other “Canadian security” (as defined in the Tax 
Act) owned by such Holder in the taxation year in which the election is made and in all subsequent taxation years deemed 
to be capital property. Such Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding whether an election under subsection 
39(4) is available and advisable in their particular circumstances.
This summary is based upon the current provisions of the Tax Act, the regulations thereunder (the “Tax Regulations”), and 
counsel  to  ECU’s  understanding  of  the  current  published  administrative  practices  and  policies  of  the  Canada  Revenue 
Agency  (the  “CRA”).  This  summary  also  takes  into  account  all  specific  proposals  to  amend  the  Tax  Act  and  Tax 
Regulations (the “Proposed Amendments”) announced by or on behalf of the Minister of Finance (Canada) prior to the 
date hereof, and assumes that all Proposed Amendments will be enacted in their present form. However, there can be no 
assurance  that  the  Proposed  Amendments  will  be  enacted  in  the  form  proposed,  or  at  all.  Except  for  the  Proposed 
Amendments,  this  summary  does  not  take  into  account  or  anticipate  any  changes  in  Law,  whether  by  legislative, 
governmental  or  judicial  action  or  decision,  nor  does  it  take  into  account  provincial,  territorial  or  foreign  income  tax 
considerations, which may differ from the Canadian federal income tax considerations discussed below.
- 92 -
Please contact Kingsdale Shareholder Services Inc. at 1-877-659-1819
if you have any questions, or require assistance completing your Proxy.
This summary is not applicable to a Holder that is a “financial institution” as defined in the Tax Act for the purposes of the 
“mark-to-market  property”  rules  or  a  “specified  financial  institution”  as  defined  in  the  Tax  Act,  nor  does  it  apply  to  a 
Holder,  an  interest  in  which  is  a  “tax  shelter  investment”  as  defined  in  the  Tax  Act,  or  to  a  Holder  that  has  made  a 
functional currency reporting election for purposes of the Tax Act. In addition, this summary does not address all issues 
relevant  to  Holders  who  acquired  their  ECU  Shares  on  the  exercise  of  an  employee  stock  option.  Such  Holders  should 
consult their own tax advisors.
In  general,  amounts  relevant  to  the  computation  of  income  under  the  Tax  Act  are  reported  in  Canadian  dollars.    Any 
amount that is expressed or denominated in a currency other than Canadian dollars, including dividends, adjusted cost base 
and proceeds of disposition, must be converted into Canadian dollars, generally based on the exchange rate quoted by the 
Bank of Canada at noon on the date each such amount arises.
This  summary  is  of  a  general  nature  only  and  is  not  exhaustive  of  all  possible  Canadian  federal  income  tax 
considerations. This summary is not, and should not be construed as, legal, business or tax advice to any particular 
Holder and no representations with respect to the tax consequences to any particular Holder are made. Accordingly, 
all Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the Canadian federal income tax consequences of the 
Arrangement applicable to their particular circumstances.
Holders Resident in Canada
This portion of the summary only applies to a Holder who, at all relevant times, is or is deemed to be a Canadian Resident 
(a “Resident Holder”).
Exchange of ECU Shares under the Arrangement
A Resident Holder whose ECU Shares are exchanged for Golden Stock and cash under the Arrangement will be considered 
to  have  disposed  of  the  ECU  Shares  for  proceeds  of  disposition  equal  to  the  aggregate  of  the  fair  market  value  at  the 
Effective Time of the Golden Stock received on the exchange and the cash consideration received on the exchange. As a 
result,  the  Resident  Holder  will,  in  general,  realize  a  capital  gain  (or  a  capital  loss)  to  the  extent  that  such  proceeds  of 
disposition  exceed  (or  are  less  than)  the  aggregate  of  the  Resident  Holder’s  adjusted  cost  base  of  the  ECU  Shares 
immediately  before  the  exchange  and  any  reasonable  costs  of  disposition.  See  “Certain  Canadian  Federal  Income  Tax 
Considerations – Holders Resident in Canada –-Taxation of Capital Gains and Capital Losses” below.
The cost to the Resident Holder of the Golden Stock acquired on the exchange will equal the fair market value of such 
Golden Stock at the Effective Time and will, for the purpose of determining the Resident Holder’s adjusted cost base of 
such Golden Stock, be averaged with the adjusted cost base to the Resident Holder of any other Golden Stock held at the 
Effective Time as capital property.
Exchange of ECU Options by Resident Employee ECU Optionholders
Resident Holders of ECU Options who: (i) acquired their ECU Options pursuant to the ECU Stock Option Plan by virtue of 
being an employee, officer or director of ECU; and (ii) exchange their ECU Options for Golden Replacement Options and 
no other consideration at the Effective Time, should not recognize any taxable income or loss as a result of such exchange 
pursuant to the Arrangement.
To the extent the above-described conditions are satisfied, a Golden Replacement Option will be deemed to be the same 
option and a continuation of the ECU Option. Further, the provisions of the Tax Act providing for the deduction of one-half 
of any resulting employee benefit should, if otherwise applicable, continue to apply if at the time of the exchange of the 
ECU Option for a Golden Replacement Option the exercise price was not less than the fair market value of an ECU Share 
at the time of grant of the ECU Option and all other applicable conditions specified in the Tax Act are satisfied.
Exchange of ECU Options by Resident Non-Employee ECU Optionholders
This summary does not address other Resident Holders of ECU Options, including consultants and independent contractors. 
Resident Holders of ECU Options who received their ECU Options otherwise than in respect of being an employee, officer

if you have any questions, or require assistance completing your Proxy.
or director of ECU should obtain their own tax advice regarding the tax consequences to them of exchanging their ECU 
Options for Golden Replacement Options pursuant to the Arrangement.
Exchange of ECU Warrants by Resident ECU Warrantholders
A Resident Holder who transfers its Warrants to Golden in exchange for Golden Replacement Warrants pursuant to the 
Arrangement will be considered to have disposed of such ECU Warrants for proceeds of disposition equal to the fair market 
value at the Effective Time of such Golden Replacement Warrants. Such Resident Holder will, in general, realize a capital 
gain  (or  capital  loss)  to  the  extent  the  proceeds  of  disposition  of  such  ECU  Warrants,  net  of  any  reasonable  costs  of 
disposition, exceed (or are less than) the adjusted cost base to such Resident Holder of such ECU Warrants immediately 
prior to the transfer. See “Certain Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations – Holders Resident in Canada –-Taxation 
of  Capital  Gains  and  Capital  Losses”  below.  The  cost  to  such  Resident  Holder  of  the  Golden  Replacement  Warrants 
acquired  on  such  transfer  will  be  equal  to  the  fair  market  value  of  such  Golden  Replacement  Warrants  at  the  Effective 
Time.
Taxation of Capital Gains and Capital Losses
Generally, a Resident Holder will be required to include in computing the holder’s income for a taxation year one-half of 
the  amount  of  any  capital  gain  (a  “taxable  capital  gain”)  realized  by  the  holder  in  that  year.  A  Resident  Holder  will 
generally be entitled to deduct one-half of the amount of any capital loss (an “allowable capital loss”) realized in a taxation 
year from taxable capital gains realized by the holder in that year. Allowable capital losses in excess of taxable capital gains 
for a taxation year may be carried back to any of the three preceding taxation years or carried forward to any subsequent 
taxation year and deducted against net taxable capital gains realized in such years, subject to the detailed rules contained in 
the Tax Act.
A capital loss realized on the disposition of an ECU Share by a Resident Holder that is a corporation may, to the extent and 
under the circumstances specified by the Tax Act, be reduced by the amount of dividends received or deemed to have been 
received by the corporation on such shares (or on a share for which such share is substituted or exchanged). Similar rules 
may apply where shares are owned by a partnership or trust of which a corporation, trust or partnership is a member or 
beneficiary. Resident Holders to whom these rules may be relevant should consult their own advisors.
A Resident Holder that is a “Canadian-controlled private corporation” (as defined in the Tax Act) may be required to pay 
an additional 62/3% refundable tax on certain investment income, which includes taxable capital gains.
Dividends on Golden Stock
Dividends  received  or  deemed  to  be  received  by  a  Resident  Holder  on  Golden  Stock  must  be  included  in  the  Resident 
Holder’s income for purposes of the Tax Act.
Such dividends received by a Resident Holder who is an individual will not be subject to the gross-up and dividend tax 
credit rules in the Tax Act.
Such dividends received by a Resident Holder that is a corporation generally will not entitle such corporate holder to deduct 
the amount of such dividends in computing its taxable income.
Such dividends received by a Resident Holder that is a  “Canadian-controlled private corporation”  may be subject to  an 
additional refundable tax of 62/3%.
Generally,  a  Resident  Holder  who  receives  a  dividend  in  respect  of  its  ownership  of  Golden  Stock  will  be  required  to 
include the amount of such dividend in income as discussed herein above and will be subject to a United States withholding 
tax of 15% as a result of application of the Canada-U.S. Treaty. However, there may be circumstances where a corporation 
resident  in  Canada  that  is  controlled  by  non-resident  persons  will  not  benefit  from  the Canada-U.S.  Treaty and  will  be 
subject to a withholding tax of 30%.

if you have any questions, or require assistance completing your Proxy.
A person  may claim the  withholding tax as a  tax credit against Canadian  income tax payable in respect of certain U.S. 
investment income in accordance with detailed rules pertaining to the calculation of such tax credit. Any withholding tax 
not deductible against Canadian income tax may be deducted in computing the person’s income subject to the detailed rules 
in the Tax Act.
Disposition of Golden Stock
A Resident Holder that disposes or is deemed to dispose of Golden Stock in a taxation year will realize a capital gain (or a 
capital loss) equal to the amount by which the proceeds of disposition of the Golden Stock exceed (or are exceeded by) the 
aggregate  of  the  Resident  Holder’s  adjusted  cost  base  of  such  Golden  Stock,  determined  immediately  before  the 
disposition, and any reasonable costs of disposition. The Resident Holder will be required to include any resulting taxable 
capital  gain  in  income,  or  be  entitled  to  deduct  any  resulting  allowable  capital  loss,  in  accordance  with  the  usual  rules 
applicable  to  capital  gains  and  capital  losses.  See  “Certain  Canadian  Federal  Income  Tax  Considerations  –  Holders 
Resident in Canada –-Taxation of Capital Gains and Capital Losses”.
Alternative Minimum Tax
A capital gain realized, or a dividend received, if any, by a Resident Holder who is an individual (including certain trusts) 
may give rise to liability for alternative minimum tax under the Tax Act.
Eligibility for Investment of Golden Stock and Golden Replacement Warrants
Golden Stock and Golden Replacement Warrants will be a qualified investment under the Tax Act for a trust governed by a 
registered  retirement  savings  plan,  registered  retirement  income  fund,  deferred  profit  sharing  plan,  registered  education 
savings plan, registered disability savings plan or a tax-free savings account (a “TFSA”) (each a “Deferred Plan”), at any 
particular time, provided that, at that time, (i) in the case of Golden Stock, the Golden Stock is listed on a “designated stock 
exchange”  (as  defined  in  the  Tax  Act),  which  currently  includes  the  TSX;  (ii)  in  the  case  of  the  Golden  Replacement 
Warrants, the Golden Replacement Warrant is listed on a designated stock exchange, or each person who is an annuitant, a 
beneficiary,  an  employer  or  a  subscriber  under,  or  a  holder  of,  the  applicable  Deferred  Plan  deals  at  arm’s  length  with 
Golden within the meaning of the Tax Act and the stock that may be acquired upon exercise of the Golden Replacement 
Warrant is a qualified investment for such Deferred Plan as described above.
Notwithstanding that Golden Stock or Golden Replacement Warrants may be qualified investments for a TFSA, a holder of 
a TFSA will be subject to a penalty tax with respect to Golden Stock or Golden Replacement Warrants held in the TFSA if 
such stock or warrant is a “prohibited investment” for the TFSA (within the meaning of the Tax Act). Golden Stock or 
Golden Replacement Warrants will not be a prohibited investment for a TFSA provided the holder of the TFSA deals at 
arm’s length with Golden for purposes of the Tax Act and does not have a “significant interest” (within the meaning of the 
Tax Act) in Golden or in any corporation, partnership or trust with which Golden does not deal at arm’s length for purposes 
of the Tax Act.
The 2011 federal budget proposes to extend the concept of “prohibited investment” to registered retirement savings 
plans and registered retirement income funds. Resident Holders should consult their tax advisors in this regard.
Dissenting Resident Holders
A  Resident  Holder  who  validly  exercises  Dissent  Rights  and  is  a  Dissenting  Shareholder  (a  “Resident  Dissenter”)  and 
consequently is paid the fair value of the Resident Dissenter’s ECU Shares by Golden in accordance with the Arrangement 
will realize a capital gain (or a capital loss) equal to the amount by which the payment (other than interest) exceeds (or is 
exceeded by) the aggregate of the Resident Holder’s adjusted cost base of the ECU Shares determined immediately before 
the Effective Time and any reasonable costs of disposition. The Resident Dissenter will be required to include any resulting 
taxable capital gain in income, or be entitled to deduct any resulting allowable capital loss, in accordance with the usual 
rules applicable to capital gains and losses. See “Certain Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations – Holders Resident 
in Canada –-Taxation of Capital Gains and Capital Losses”.
A Resident Dissenter must include in computing its income any interest awarded to it by a court.

Foreign Property Information Reporting
In  general,  a  “specified  Canadian  entity”,  as  defined  in  the  Tax  Act,  whose  total  cost  amount  of  “specified  foreign 
property”, as defined in the Tax Act, at any time in the taxation year or fiscal period exceeds Cdn$100,000, is required to 
file an information return for the year or period disclosing prescribed information, including the cost amount, any dividends 
received in the year, and any gains or losses realized in the year, in respect of such property.  Subject to certain exceptions, 
a taxpayer resident in Canada in the year will be a specified Canadian entity.  Specified foreign property is defined in the 
Tax Act to include shares of the capital stock of a non-resident corporation and property that, under the terms or conditions 
thereof or any agreement related thereto, is convertible into, exchangeable for or confers a right to acquire, property that is a 
share of the capital of a non-resident corporation.
Golden Stock is, and Golden Replacement Options and Golden Replacement Warrants will be, specified foreign property. 
As a result, if the aggregate cost amount of any specified foreign property held by a Resident Holder that is a specified 
Canadian entity at any time in a taxation year or fiscal period exceeds Cdn$100,000, the Resident Holder will be required to 
file an information return for the year as described hereinabove. Resident Holders are encouraged to consult their own 
tax advisors as to whether they must file an information return under these rules.
Holders not Resident in Canada
This portion of the summary applies to a Holder who, at all relevant times, for the purposes of the Tax Act, is not, and is 
not  deemed  to  be,  a  Canadian  Resident  and  does  not  use  or  hold,  and  is  not  deemed  to  use  or  hold,  ECU 
Securities or Golden Securities in connection with carrying on a business in Canada (a “Non-Resident Holder”). Special 
rules, which are not discussed in this summary, may apply to a Holder that is an insurer carrying on business in Canada and 
elsewhere.
Exchange of ECU Shares under the Arrangement and Subsequent Disposition of Golden Stock
A Non-Resident Holder whose ECU Shares are exchanged for Golden Stock and cash under the Arrangement will not be 
subject  to  tax  under  the  Tax  Act  on  any  capital  gain  realized  on  such  exchange  unless  the  ECU  Shares  are  “taxable 
Canadian property” (as defined in the Tax Act) to the Non-Resident Holder at the Effective Time and the ECU Shares are 
not “treaty-protected property” (as defined in the Tax Act) of the Non-Resident Holder at the time of the exchange.
Based upon the current provisions of the Tax Act, generally, an ECU Share will not be taxable Canadian property to a Non-
Resident Holder at a particular time provided that such share is listed on a “designated stock exchange” (as defined in the 
Tax Act), which includes the TSX, unless at any time during the 60 month period immediately preceding the disposition (i) 
the Non-Resident Holder, persons with whom the Non-Resident Holder did not deal at arm’s length, or the Non-Resident 
Holder together with all such persons, owned 25% or more of the issued shares of any class or series of shares of the capital 
stock of ECU and (ii) more than 50% of the fair market value of the particular share was derived directly or indirectly from 
one or any combination of real or immovable property situated in Canada, Canadian resource properties (as defined in the 
Tax Act), timber resource properties (all within the meaning of the Tax Act), and/or options in respect of, or interests in, or 
for civil law rights in, any of the foregoing properties (whether or not such property exists). Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
an ECU Share may also be deemed to be taxable Canadian property to a Non-Resident Holder in certain circumstances 
specified in the Tax Act.
Even if an ECU Share is taxable Canadian property to a Non-Resident Holder, such share will be treaty protected property 
of  the  Non-Resident  Holder  at  the  time  of  disposition  (which  time  includes  an  exchange  of  an  ECU  Share  under  the 
Arrangement)  for  purposes  of  the  Tax  Act  if  the  capital  gain  from  the  disposition  of  that  share  would,  because  of  an 
applicable income tax convention  to  which  Canada is a  signatory, be exempt  from tax under the Tax  Act. Many of the 
income tax treaties to  which  Canada is a  signatory, including  the  Canada-U.S. Treaty,  provide that Canada reserves the 
right to tax (i.e., does not exempt from Canadian tax) gains on the sale of real property situated in Canada, which for these 
purposes  may  include  (and  under  the  Canada-U.S.  Treaty,  does  include)  a  share  of  the  capital  stock  of  a  corporation 
resident  in  Canada,  the  value  of  whose  shares  is  derived  principally  from  real  property  or  resource  property  situated  in 
Canada. Non-Resident Holders should consult their own tax advisors in this regard.

if you have any questions, or require assistance completing your Proxy.
In the event an ECU Share is taxable Canadian property to a Non-Resident Holder at the time of disposition and is not 
treaty-protected property of the Non-Resident Holder at that time, the tax consequences described above under “Certain 
Canadian  Federal  Income  Tax  Considerations  – Holders  Resident  in  Canada  –  Exchange  of  ECU  Shares  under  the 
Arrangement”  and  “Certain  Canadian  Federal  Income  Tax  Considerations  –  Holders  Resident  in  Canada  –  Taxation  of 
Capital Gains and Capital Losses” will generally apply. Non-Resident Holders should consult their own tax advisors 
with respect to the Canadian tax consequences of disposing of such shares.
Disposition of Golden Stock
Any capital gain realized by a Non-Resident Holder on a disposition or deemed disposition of Golden Stock acquired under 
the Arrangement will not be subject to tax under the Tax Act unless the Golden Stock is taxable Canadian property to the 
Non-Resident Holder at the time of the disposition and the shares are not treaty-protected property of the Non-Resident 
Holder at the time of disposition.
Exchange of ECU Options by Non-Resident Employee ECU Optionholders
Non-Resident Holders of ECU Options who: (i) acquired their ECU Options pursuant to the ECU Stock Option Plan by 
virtue of employment with ECU in Canada; and (ii) exchange their ECU Options for Golden Replacement Options and no 
other consideration at the Effective Time, should not recognize any taxable income or loss as a result of such exchange 
pursuant to the Arrangement.
To the extent the above-described conditions are satisfied, a Golden Replacement Option will be deemed to be the same 
option and a continuation of the ECU Option. Further, the provisions of the Tax Act providing for the deduction of one-half 
of any resulting employee benefit should, if otherwise applicable, continue to apply if at the time of the exchange of the 
ECU Option for a Golden Replacement Option the exercise price was not less than the fair market value of an ECU Share 
at the time of grant of the ECU Option and all other applicable conditions specified in the Tax Act are satisfied.
Exchange of ECU Options by Non-Resident Non-Employee ECU Optionholders
This  summary  does  not  address  other  Non-Resident  Holders  of  ECU  Options,  including  consultants  and  independent 
contractors. Non-Resident Holders of ECU Options who received their ECU Options otherwise than in respect of being an 
employee,  officer  or  director  of  ECU  should  obtain  their  own  tax  advice  regarding  the  tax  consequences  to  them  of 
exchanging their ECU Options for Golden Replacement Options.
Exchange of ECU Warrants by Non-Resident ECU Warrantholder
A  Non-Resident  Holder  who  transfers  its  ECU  Warrants  to  Golden  for  Golden  Replacement  Warrants  pursuant  to  the 
Arrangement will not generally be subject to income tax under the Tax Act in respect of any capital gain realized by such 
holder on such transfer at the Effective Time unless such ECU Warrants are taxable Canadian property (as discussed above 
under “Certain Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations – Holders not Resident in Canada – Exchange of ECU Shares 
under the Arrangement and Subsequent Disposition of Golden Stock”) to such holder at the time of the transfer and the 
ECU Warrants are not treaty-protected property (as discussed above under the heading “Certain Canadian Federal Income 
Tax  Considerations  – Holders  Resident  in  Canada  –  Exchange  of  ECU  Shares  under  the  Arrangement”  and  “Certain 
Canadian  Federal  Income  Tax  Considerations  –  Holders  Resident  in  Canada  –  Taxation  of  Capital  Gains  and  Capital 
Losses” and “Certain Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations – Holders not Resident in Canada – Exchange of ECU 
Shares under the Arrangement and Subsequent Disposition of Golden Stock”) of the Non-Resident Holder at the time of 
disposition.
Even  if  an  ECU  Warrant  is  taxable  Canadian  property  to  a  Non-Resident  Holder,  such  ECU  Warrant  will  be  treaty 
protected property  of  the  Non-Resident  Holder  at  the  time  of  disposition  (which  time  includes  an  exchange  of  an  ECU 
Warrant under the Arrangement) for purposes of the Tax Act if the capital gain from the disposition of that ECU Warrant 
would, because of an applicable income tax convention to which Canada is a signatory, be exempt from tax under the Tax 
Act. Non-Resident Holders should consult their own tax advisors in this regard.

Dissenting Non-Resident Holders
A Non-Resident Holder who has validly exercised Dissent Rights and that is a Dissenting Shareholder (a “Non-Resident 
Dissenter”) and consequently is paid the fair value for the Non-Resident Dissenter’s ECU Shares by Golden may realize a 
capital  gain  or  capital  loss  as  discussed  above  under  “Certain  Canadian  Federal  Income  Tax  Considerations  –  Holders 
Resident  in  Canada  –  Dissenting  Resident  Holders”.  As  discussed  above  under  “Certain  Canadian  Federal  Income  Tax 
Considerations  –  Holders  Not  Resident  in  Canada  -  Exchange  of  ECU  Shares  under  the  Arrangement  and  Subsequent 
Disposition of Golden Stock”, any resulting capital gain would only be subject to tax under the Tax Act if the ECU Shares 
are taxable Canadian property to the Non-Resident Holder at the Effective Time and are not treaty-protected property of the 
Non-Resident Holder at that time.
An amount paid in respect of interest awarded by the court to a Non-Resident Dissenter will not be subject to Canadian 
withholding tax.
CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS
The following summary describes certain U.S. federal income tax consequences generally applicable to U.S. Holders (as 
defined below) of ECU Shares and ECU Warrants relating to the exchange of ECU Shares for Golden Stock and cash, and 
the exchange of ECU Warrants for Golden Replacement Warrants, pursuant to the Arrangement, and certain U.S. federal 
income tax consequences generally applicable to Non-U.S. Holders of the ownership and disposition of Golden Stock and 
Golden Replacement Warrants received pursuant to the Arrangement. This summary addresses only holders who hold the 
ECU  Shares  and  ECU  Warrants  and  Golden  Stock  and  Golden  Replacement  Warrants  as  “capital  assets”  within  the 
meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “U.S. Tax Code”) (generally, assets held 
for investment purposes). This summary is for general information purposes only and does not purport to be a complete 
analysis of all potential U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to particular holders in light of their 
particular  circumstances,  nor  does  it  deal  with  persons  subject  to  special  treatment  under  the  U.S.  Tax  Code,  such  as 
brokers,  dealers  or  traders  in  securities,  banks  and  other  financial  institutions,  mutual  funds,  holders  subject  to  the 
alternative minimum tax, tax-exempt organizations, passive foreign investment companies, persons that have a functional 
currency  other  than  the  United  States  dollar,  qualified  retirement  plans,  individual  retirement  accounts  and  other  tax-
deferred  accounts,  insurance  companies,  real  estate  investment  trusts,  regulated  investment  companies,  persons  holding 
ECU Shares, ECU Warrants, Golden Stock and Golden Replacement Warrants as part of a straddle, hedge or conversion 
transaction  or  as  part  of  a  synthetic  security  or  other  integrated  transaction,  persons  that  elect  to  use  a  mark-to-market 
method  of  accounting  for  their  securities  holdings  or  ECU  Shares  or  ECU  Warrants  or  Golden  Replacement  Warrants, 
Dissenting Shareholders, persons deemed to sell ECU Shares under the constructive sale provisions of the U.S. Tax Code, 
persons who actually or constructively own or have owned (including through attribution) 10% or more of ECU Shares or 
Golden Stock by vote or value, U.S. expatriates, and persons that acquired ECU Shares or ECU Warrants or Golden Stock 
in a compensation transaction. In addition, this summary does not address persons that hold an interest in a partnership or 
other pass-through entity that holds ECU Shares or ECU Warrants or Golden Stock or Golden Replacement Warrants, or 
tax  considerations  arising  under  the  Laws  of  any  state,  local,  or  non-U.S.  jurisdiction  or  other  U.S.  federal  tax 
considerations (e.g., estate or gift tax) other than those pertaining to the income tax. Holders and persons listed above are 
urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax considerations applicable to them.
The  following  is  based  upon  the  U.S.  Tax  Code,  Treasury  regulations  promulgated  thereunder,  judicial  authorities, 
published  positions  of  the  IRS  and  other  applicable  authorities,  all  as  in  effect  on  the  date  hereof  and  all  of  which  are 
subject to change or differing interpretations (possibly with retroactive effect).
No rulings have been or will be sought from the IRS, and ECU has not received any legal opinion, regarding any of the tax 
consequences discussed herein. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would 
not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax considerations set forth below.
As used herein, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of ECU Shares, ECU Warrants, Golden Stock or Golden 
Replacement Warrants, as applicable, that is (i) a citizen or individual resident of the U.S., (ii) a corporation (or an entity 
classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the Laws of the U.S. or 
any political subdivision thereof, (iii) an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of 
its source, or (iv) a trust if (A) a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over its administration and one or more

U.S.  persons,  within  the  meaning  of  Section  7701(a)(30)  of  the  U.S.  Tax  Code,  have  authority  to  control  all  of  its 
substantial decisions or (B) it has properly elected under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.
As used herein, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of ECU Shares, ECU Warrants, Golden Stock or 
Golden Replacement Warrants that is not a U.S. Holder or a partnership or an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership 
for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
The  tax  treatment  of  a  partner  in  a  partnership  (or  other  entity  classified  as  a  partnership  for  U.S.  federal  income  tax 
purposes) may depend on both the partnership’s and the partner’s status and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships 
that are beneficial owners of ECU Shares, ECU Warrants, Golden Stock or Golden Replacement Warrants, and partners in 
such  partnerships,  should  consult  their  own  tax  advisors  regarding  the  U.S.  federal,  state,  local  and  non-U.S.  tax 
considerations applicable to them relating to the exchange of ECU Shares for Golden Stock and cash, or of ECU Warrants 
for Golden Replacement Warrants, pursuant to the  Arrangement, and the ownership and disposition of Golden Stock or 
Golden Replacement Warrants received pursuant to the Arrangement.
TO  ENSURE  COMPLIANCE  WITH  TREASURY  DEPARTMENT  CIRCULAR  230,  U.S.  HOLDERS  ARE 
HEREBY NOTIFIED THAT: (A) ANY DISCUSSION OF FEDERAL TAX ISSUES IN THIS CIRCULAR IS NOT 
INTENDED OR WRITTEN TO BE USED, AND CANNOT BE USED, BY U.S. HOLDERS FOR THE PURPOSE 
OF AVOIDING PENALTIES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED ON SUCH HOLDERS UNDER THE U.S. TAX CODE; 
(B)  THIS  DISCUSSION  IS  BEING  USED  IN  CONNECTION  WITH  THE  PROMOTION  OR  MARKETING 
(WITHIN  THE  MEANING  OF  CIRCULAR  230)  OF  THE  TRANSACTIONS  OR  MATTERS  DISCUSSED 
HEREIN;  AND 
INVESTORS  SHOULD  SEEK  ADVICE  BASED  ON  THEIR  PARTICULAR 
CIRCUMSTANCES FROM AN INDEPENDENT TAX ADVISOR.
(C)
U.S. Federal Income Tax Characterization of the Arrangement
The exchange of ECU Shares for Golden  Stock and cash, and the exchange of ECU  Warrants for Golden  Replacement 
Warrants, pursuant to the Arrangement is intended to be treated as a taxable exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes, 
and the following discussion  assumes that the transaction  contemplated by the  Arrangement  will be treated as a taxable 
exchange for U.S. federal income tax consequences. However, there is no assurance that the IRS  would agree  with this 
characterization,  and  no  opinion  of  legal  counsel  or  ruling  from  the  IRS  concerning  the  U.S.  federal  income  tax 
consequences of the transactions contemplated by the Arrangement has been obtained, and none will be requested.
Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations
The U.S. federal income tax consequences to a U.S. Holder with respect to the Arrangement depend on whether ECU is 
treated as a PFIC during any year in which a U.S. Holder owned ECU Shares or ECU Warrants. In general, a non-U.S. 
corporation will be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year during which either (i) 75% or more of the non-U.S. corporation’s 
gross income is passive income (the “income test”), or (ii) 50% or more of the average value of the non-U.S. corporation’s 
assets produce or are held for the production of passive income (the “asset test”).
ECU believes, and the following discussion assumes, that it may be and may have been a PFIC in one or more years since 
its formation.
Exchange of ECU Shares for Golden Stock and Cash, and Exchange of ECU Warrants for Golden Replacement 
Warrants, Pursuant to the Arrangement
U.S. Holders
Gain or Loss Recognition Generally
As discussed below, the U.S. income tax treatment of gain recognized in the Arrangement by a U.S. Holder will depend on 
whether ECU is or has been a PFIC at any time during the U.S. Holder’s holding period in ECU Shares or ECU Warrants, 
and (if ECU was a PFIC at any such time) on whether the U.S. Holder has made certain U.S. income tax elections with 
respect to the ECU Shares.
- 99 -
Please contact Kingsdale Shareholder Services Inc. at 1-877-659-1819
if you have any questions, or require assistance completing your Proxy.
Each U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between (a) the sum of the (i) U.S. dollar equivalent of 
the Canadian dollars received calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt and (ii) the fair 
market value of the Golden Stock or Golden Replacement Warrants received and (b) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in 
its ECU Shares or ECU Warrants disposed of pursuant to the Arrangement.
Under  proposed  Treasury  Regulations  (the  “Proposed  Treasury  Regulations”),  a  U.S.  Holder  who  has  an  option  to 
acquire stock of a PFIC is considered to own stock of a PFIC for purposes of applying the rules governing the taxation of 
gain  recognized  upon  the  disposition  of  stock  of  a  PFIC.    Under  the  Proposed  Treasury  Regulations,  holders  of  ECU 
Warrants who exchange such warrants for Golden Replacement Warrants pursuant to the Arrangement will be treated as 
having  disposed  of  the  stock  of  a  PFIC  if  they  held  ECU  Warrants  during  any  period  in  which  ECU  was  a  PFIC.  
Accordingly, any gain realized upon the exchange will be subject to tax under the “excess distribution” regime described 
below.
Gain Recognized by Non-PFIC Shareholders and Non-PFIC Warrantholders
Any gain recognized by a U.S. Holder whose holding period in ECU Shares or ECU Warrants does not include any period 
during which ECU was a PFIC will be treated as a capital gain, and as a long-term capital gain if the U.S. Holder’s holding 
period with respect to its ECU Shares or ECU Warrants is more than one year at the time of the Arrangement.
PFIC Warrantholders and Non-Electing PFIC Shareholders
Any  gain  recognized  by  a  U.S.  Holder  whose  holding  period  for  the  ECU  Shares  or  ECU  Warrants  include  any  period 
during which ECU was a PFIC will be taxed under the PFIC “excess distribution” regime (assuming, with respect to ECU 
Shares, that the U.S. Holder has not made the “mark-to-market” election described below) . Under that regime, gain, if any, 
realized  by  a  U.S.  Holder  who  disposes  of  ECU  Shares  or  ECU  Warrants  pursuant  to  the  Arrangement  will  (except  as 
described in the section that follows) be allocated ratably to each day of the U.S. Holder’s holding period with respect to 
such ECU Shares or ECU Warrants. Gain allocated to the year of disposition and to any year before ECU became a PFIC 
will be treated as arising in the year of disposition and taxed at ordinary U.S. federal income tax rates. Gain allocated to 
each of the other years will be taxed at the highest ordinary U.S. federal income tax rate in effect for each of those years, 
and interest will be added to the tax determined for each of those years. The sum of the taxes and interest calculated for all 
other years will be an addition to the tax for the year in which the disposition of the ECU Shares or ECU Warrants occurs. 
A U.S. Holder that is not a corporation must treat the interest as non-deductible personal interest.
Any loss recognized by a U.S. Holder will generally be treated as capital loss, which will be long-term capital loss if the 
U.S. Holder’s holding period with respect to its ECU Shares or ECU Warrants is more than one year at the time of the 
Arrangement, subject to the special rules described in the section that follows. The deductibility of capital loss is subject to 
limitations. For U.S. foreign tax credit purposes, any such gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder generally will be treated 
as gain or loss from sources within the United States
PFIC Shareholders who have made a “Market-to-Market” Election
If a U.S. Holder of ECU Shares has made a valid election to recognize any gain or loss on its ECU Shares on a mark-to-
market basis at the end of each taxable year, then any gain on the exchange of the ECU Shares in the Arrangement will be 
treated as ordinary income.  Any loss on the exchange pursuant to the Arrangement will be treated as ordinary loss to the 
extent of the U.S. Holder’s prior net mark-to-market gains.  Any remaining losses will generally be treated as capital losses, 
and as long-term capital losses if the U.S. Holder’s holding period in the shares exceeded one year.  The mark-to-market 
election is not available for ECU Warrants.
Under the Proposed Treasury Regulations, if ECU is a PFIC and owns shares of another PFIC (a “lower-tier PFIC”), a 
shareholder of ECU is treated as an indirect owner of the shares of the lower-tier PFIC, and must account for gains from the 
indirect  disposition  of  the  lower-tier  PFIC  as  an  excess  distribution  separately.    ECU  believes  that  one  or  more  of  its 
subsidiaries may have been a PFIC in one or more years.  The Proposed Treasury Regulations provide for corresponding 
basis adjustments of the stock through which ownership of the lower-tier PFIC is attributed.   A mark-to-market election 
generally may not be made for stock of a lower-tier PFIC.

if you have any questions, or require assistance completing your Proxy.
Basis and Holding Period in Golden Stock
A U.S. Holder will have an initial tax basis in the Golden Stock or Golden Replacement Warrants received pursuant to the 
Arrangement  equal  to  the  fair  market  value  of  such  shares  and  warrants  at  the  time  of  their  receipt.  The  U.S.  Holder’s 
holding period for such Golden Stock or Golden Replacement Warrants will commence on the day after the date of receipt.
Cash Consideration Received Pursuant to the Arrangement
Any cash consideration paid in Canadian dollars pursuant to the Arrangement will be taken into account in determining the 
taxable gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder of ECU Shares in a U.S. dollar amount calculated by reference to the 
exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt by such U.S. Holder, regardless of whether the cash consideration is in fact 
converted into U.S. dollars. Such Canadian dollars received by a U.S. Holder will have a tax basis equal to their U.S. dollar 
value at the time such proceeds are received. If such Canadian dollars are converted into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt, 
the U.S. Holder generally should not be required to recognize foreign currency gain or loss. The amount of gain or loss 
recognized  on  a  subsequent  sale  or  other  disposition  of  such  Canadian  dollars  will  equal  the  difference  between  (i)  the 
amount of U.S. dollars, or the fair market value in U.S. dollars of other property received, in such sale or other disposition, 
and (ii) the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in such Canadian dollars. Any  such  gain or loss  generally  will be treated as United 
States source ordinary income or loss.
PFIC Information Reporting
U.S. Holders whose holding period in the ECU Shares or ECU Warrants include any period during which ECU was a PFIC 
must report certain information to the IRS on Form 8621 with their U.S. federal income tax return.  U.S. Holders are urged 
to consult with their own tax advisors concerning such reporting requirements.
Status of Proposed Treasury Regulations
The Proposed Treasury Regulations state that they are to be effective for transactions occurring on or after April 11, 1992. 
If the Proposed Treasury Regulations are adopted in their current form, the tax consequences to a U.S. Holder should be as 
set forth in the preceding paragraphs.  However, because the Proposed Treasury Regulations have not yet been adopted in 
final form, they are not currently effective and there is no assurance they will be finally adopted in the form and with the 
effective date proposed.  Nevertheless, the IRS has announced that, in the absence of final Treasury Regulations, taxpayers 
may apply reasonable interpretations of Code provisions applicable to PFICs and that it considers the rules set forth in the 
Proposed Treasury Regulations to be reasonable interpretations of those Code provisions.
The rules governing the taxation of the disposition of securities of a PFIC are complex, and holders of ECU Shares 
or ECU Warrants are urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax considerations applicable to them.
Non-U.S. Holders
A Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax (or any withholding thereof) with respect to any 
gain recognized on the exchange of ECU Shares for cash and Golden Stock, or ECU Warrants for Golden Replacement 
Warrants, unless (i) the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of the Non-U.S. Holder in the U.S. and, in 
cases in which certain tax treaties apply, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment or fixed base of the Non-U.S. 
Holder (collectively, “effectively connected gain”); or (ii) the Non-U.S. Holder is a non-resident alien individual who is 
present in the U.S. for 183 or more days during the taxable year of disposition and meets certain other requirements.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
In general, information reporting will apply with respect to cash proceeds received on the disposition of ECU Shares that 
are  paid  to  a  U.S.  Holder  within  the  United  States  (and,  in  certain  cases,  outside  of  the  United  States),  unless  the  U.S. 
Holder establishes that it is an exempt recipient, such as a corporation.  Backup withholding (currently imposed at a rate of 
28%)  may  apply  to  such  payments  if  the  U.S.  Holder  fails  to  timely  provide  a  taxpayer  identification  number  or 
certification of exempt status or has failed to report in full dividend and interest income in prior taxable years.
- 101 -
Please contact Kingsdale Shareholder Services Inc. at 1-877-659-1819
if you have any questions, or require assistance completing your Proxy.
Payments to Non-U.S. Holders through certain U.S.-related financial intermediaries will generally be subject to information 
reporting,  and  depending  on  the  circumstances  backup  withholding,  unless  the  Non-U.S.  Holder,  or  beneficial  owner 
thereof,  as  applicable,  certifies  that  it  is  a  Non-U.S.  Holder  on  Form  W-8BEN  (or  other  applicable  form),  or  otherwise 
establishes an exemption and the payor does not have actual knowledge or reason to know the holder is a U.S. person, as 
defined under the Code, that is not an exempt recipient.  Copies of the information returns reporting any such payments and 
withholding may also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which the Non-U.S. Holder resides under 
the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty
Backup withholding is not an additional tax.  Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as 
a refund or a credit against such holder’s federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished 
to the IRS.
Ownership and Disposition of Golden Stock and Golden Replacement Warrants Received Pursuant to the 
Arrangement
U.S. Holders
Exercise of Golden Replacement Warrants
A U.S. Holder generally will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the cash exercise of a 
Golden  Replacement  Warrant.  A  U.S.  Holder’s  tax  basis  in  the  Golden  Stock  received  on  a  cash  exercise  of  a  Golden 
Replacement Warrant will equal the sum of the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the Golden Replacement Warrant plus the cash 
paid to exercise the Golden Replacement Warrant. The holding period of the Golden Stock received on the cash exercise of 
a Golden Replacement Warrant should begin on the date of exercise.
The  tax  treatment  of  a  cashless  exercise  of  a  Golden  Replacement  Warrant,  if  available,  (i.e.,  where  a  portion  of  the 
holder’s Golden Replacement Warrants are surrendered as the exercise price for other Golden Replacement Warrants) is 
uncertain. A cashless exercise may, for example, be treated as a tax-free “recapitalization,” in which case a holder’s tax 
basis in  the  stock received  would equal the tax basis in the surrendered Golden Replacement Warrants.  Alternatively, a 
cashless exercise may be treated similarly to a cash exercise. It is also possible that a cashless exercise could be treated as a 
taxable exchange in which gain or loss should be recognized.
The holding period for Golden Stock acquired in a cashless exercise will depend on the United States federal income tax 
treatment of a cashless exercise. The holding period for a share of Golden Stock acquired in a cashless exercise may include 
the  holder’s  holding  period  for  the  exercised  Golden  Replacement  Warrant  if  the  cashless  exercise  is  treated  as  a 
recapitalization, or the holding period may begin on the date the Golden Replacement Warrant is exercised if the cashless 
exercise is treated similarly to a cash exercise, or the holding period may begin on the day following the date of exercise if 
the cashless exercise is treated as a taxable exchange. Due to the absence of authority on the United States federal income 
tax  treatment  of  a  cashless  exercise,  there  can  be  no  assurance  which,  if  any,  of  the  alternative  tax  consequences  and 
holding periods described above would be adopted by the IRS or a court of law. Accordingly, holders are urged to consult 
their tax advisors as to the tax consequences of a cashless exercise.
Adjustment to Golden Replacement Warrants
Adjustments to the exercise price or the number of shares to be received upon exercise of a Golden Replacement Warrant 
may  in  some  circumstances  result  in  a  deemed  dividend  to  a  U.S.  Holder  to  the  extent  of  the  Golden’s  current  or 
accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles, if such change has the effect of 
increasing the U.S. Holder’s proportionate interest in the earnings and profits of Golden.
Sale or Exchange of Golden Replacement Warrants
Upon the sale or exchange of a Golden Replacement Warrant, a U.S. Holder will generally recognize gain or loss equal to 
the difference between the amount realized on such sale or exchange and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Golden 
Replacement Warrant.  The gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if
- 102 -
Please contact Kingsdale Shareholder Services Inc. at 1-877-659-1819
if you have any questions, or require assistance completing your Proxy.
the U.S. Holder’s holding period in the Golden Replacement Warrant exceeds one year at the time of such sale or exchange. 
The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
Expiration of Golden Replacement Warrants
Upon the expiration of a Golden Replacement Warrant, a U.S. Holder will recognize a capital loss equal to its adjusted tax 
basis in the Golden Replacement Warrant.  The loss will be a long-term capital loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period in 
the Golden Replacement Warrant exceeded one year at the time of the expiration.  The deductibility of capital losses is 
subject to limitations.
Non-U.S. Holders
Distributions on Golden Stock
Distributions  with  respect  to  Golden  Stock  will  be  treated  as  dividends  when  paid  to  the  extent  of  Golden’s  current  or 
accumulated earnings and profits as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Generally, distributions treated as 
dividends paid to a Non-U.S. Holder with respect to Golden Stock will be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax, or such 
lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty. Distributions that are effectively connected with such 
Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if a tax treaty applies, are attributable to a U.S. 
permanent establishment of such holder) are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis and are 
exempt from the 30% withholding tax (assuming compliance with certain certification requirements). Any such effectively 
connected  distributions  received  by  a  Non-U.S.  Holder  that  is  a  corporation  may  also,  under  certain  circumstances,  be 
subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a 30% rate or such lower rate as may be applicable under an income tax 
treaty.
For purposes of obtaining a reduced rate of withholding under an income tax treaty, a Non-U.S. Holder will generally be 
required to provide a U.S. taxpayer identification number as well as certain information concerning the holder’s country of 
residence and entitlement to tax treaty benefits.  A Non-U.S. Holder can  generally  meet the certification requirement by 
providing a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN (if the holder is claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty) or Form 
W-8ECI (if the dividends are effectively connected with a trade or business in the United States) or suitable substitute form.
If a distribution exceeds Golden’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, the excess  will be treated as a tax-free 
return of the Non-U.S. Holder’s investment to the extent of the Non-U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its Golden Stock.  
Any remaining excess will be treated as capital gain from a sale or disposition of such stock.  A Non-U.S. Holder will have 
an initial tax basis in the Golden Stock received pursuant to the Arrangement equal to the fair market value of such shares 
at the time of their receipt.
Sale or Exchange of Golden Stock and Golden Replacement Warrants
A Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax (or any withholding thereof) with respect to 
gain  recognized  on  a  sale  or  other  disposition  of  Golden  Stock  or  Golden  Replacement  Warrants  unless  (i)  the  gain  is 
effectively connected with a trade or business of the Non-U.S. Holder in the U.S. and, in cases in which certain tax treaties 
apply, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment or fixed base of the Non-U.S.  Holder (collectively, “effectively 
connected gain”); or (ii) the Non-U.S. Holder is a non-resident alien individual who is present in the U.S. for 183 or more 
days during the taxable year of disposition and meets certain other requirements.
Exercise of Golden Replacement Warrants.
The U.S. federal income tax treatment of a Non-U.S. Holder upon the exercise of a Golden Replacement Warrant will be 
the same as that of U.S. Holder, as described above under “Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations –
Ownership and Disposition of Golden Stock and Golden Replacement Warrants Received Pursuant to the Arrangement --
U.S. Holders - Exercise of Golden Replacement Warrants” (except if a cashless exercise results in the recognition of gain or 
loss to the Non-U.S. Holder), which will be treated in the same manner as described above under “Certain United States 
Federal  Income  Tax  Considerations  –  Ownership  and  Disposition  of  Golden  Stock  and  Golden  Replacement  Warrants

Received Pursuant to the Arrangement Non-U.S. Holders - Sale or Exchange of Golden Stock and Golden Replacement 
Warrants”.
Adjustments to Golden Replacement Warrants.
To the extent that an adjustment to the exercise price or the number of shares of Golden Stock to be received upon exercise 
of a Golden Replacement Warrant results in a deemed dividend to a Non-U.S. Holder, such dividend will be treated in the 
same manner as an actual dividend paid with respect to Golden Stock (as described above).
Expiration of Golden Replacement Warrants.
If gain on the sale or exchange of a Golden Replacement Warrant would be treated as U.S. trade or business income to a 
Non-U.S.  Holder,  the  U.S.  federal  income  tax  consequences  to  such  Non-U.S.  Holder  upon  expiration  of  the  Golden 
Replacement Warrant will be the same as those to a U.S. Holder, as described above.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
In general, information reporting will also apply with respect to the amount of dividends paid to holders of Golden Stock 
and the tax withheld with respect to such dividends, regardless of whether withholding was required.  Backup withholding 
(currently  imposed  at  a  rate  of  28%)  will  generally  apply  to  such  dividends  paid  to  a  Non-U.S.  Holder  unless  proper 
certification  of  non-U.S.  status  (usually  on  an  IRS  Form  W-8BEN)  is  provided,  and  the  payor  does  not  have  actual 
knowledge or reason to know that the beneficial owner is a U.S. person, as defined under the Code.
Payment  of  the  proceeds  of  a  sale  of  Golden  Stock  within  the  United  States  or  conducted  through  certain  U.S.-related 
financial  intermediaries  is  subject  to  information  reporting  and,  depending  on  the  circumstances,  backup  withholding, 
unless the Non-U.S. Holder, or beneficial owner thereof, as applicable, certifies that it is a Non-U.S. Holder on Form W-
8BEN (or other applicable form), or otherwise establishes an exemption and the payor does not have actual knowledge or 
reason to know the holder is a U.S. person, as defined under the Code, that is not an exempt recipient.
Copies of the information returns reporting any of the foregoing payments and withholding may also be made available to 
the tax authorities in the country in which the Non-U.S. Holder resides under the provisions of an applicable income tax 
treaty.
Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against such Non-U.S. 
Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.
Recently Enacted Withholding and Information Reporting Legislation Applicable to U.S. and Non-U.S. Holders
Recently  enacted  legislation  will  require,  after  December  31,  2012,  withholding  at  a  rate  of  30  percent  on  dividends  in 
respect of, and gross proceeds from the sale of, Golden Stock and Golden Replacement Warrants held by or through certain 
foreign  financial  institutions  (including  investment  funds),  unless  such  institution  enters  into  an  agreement  with  the 
Secretary of the Treasury to report, on an annual basis, information with respect to shares in the institution held by certain 
U.S. persons and by certain non-U.S. entities that are wholly or partially owned by U.S. persons. Accordingly, the entity 
through  which  Golden  Stock  and  Golden  Replacement  Warrants  are  held  will  affect  the  determination  of  whether  such 
withholding is required. Similarly, dividends in respect of, and gross proceeds from the sale of, Golden Stock and Golden 
Replacement Warrants  held by an investor that is a non-financial non-US entity will be subject to withholding at a rate of 
30 percent, unless such entity either (i) certifies that such entity does not have any “substantial United States owners” or (ii) 
provides certain information regarding the entity’s “substantial United States owners,” which will in turn be provided to the 
Secretary  of  the  Treasury.  U.S.  Holders  and  Non-U.S.  Holders  are  encouraged  to  consult  with  their  own  tax  advisors 
regarding  the  possible  implications  of  the  legislation  on  their  ownership  of  Golden  Stock  and  Golden  Replacement 
Warrants.
THE  ABOVE  SUMMARY  IS  NOT  INTENDED  TO  CONSTITUTE  A  COMPLETE  ANALYSIS  OF  ALL  TAX 
CONSIDERATIONS  APPLICABLE  TO  HOLDERS  RELATING  TO  THE  EXCHANGE  OF  ECU  SHARES  FOR

TO  THE  ARRANGEMENT,  AND  THE  OWNERSHIP  AND  DISPOSITION  OF  GOLDEN  STOCK  AND  GOLDEN 
REPLACEMENT  WARRANTS  RECEIVED  PURSUANT  TO  THE  ARRANGEMENT.  HOLDERS  SHOULD 
CONSULT  THEIR  OWN  TAX  ADVISORS  AS  TO  THE  TAX  CONSIDERATIONS  APPLICABLE  TO  THEM  IN 
THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.
SECURITIES LAWS CONSIDERATIONS
The  following  is  a  brief  summary  of  the  securities  law  considerations  applicable  to  the  Arrangement  and  transactions 
contemplated thereby.
Canadian Securities Laws
Status under Canadian Securities Laws
ECU  is  a  reporting  issuer  in  all  of  the  provinces  of  Canada.  ECU  Shares  currently  trade  on  the  TSX  under  the  symbol 
“ECU” and the February 2009 Warrants currently trade on the TSX under the symbol “ECU.WT”. Following the closing of 
the Arrangement, the ECU Shares and the February 2009 Warrants will be delisted from the TSX, and Golden will apply to 
the applicable Canadian Securities Authorities to have ECU cease to be a reporting issuer.
Golden is a reporting issuer in the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario. Golden Stock is listed on the TSX 
under the symbol “AUM” and on the NYSE Amex under the symbol “AUMN”. It is a condition of the Arrangement that 
the shares of Golden Stock issued to ECU Shareholders pursuant to the Arrangement, and which are reserved for issue upon 
exercise of the Golden Replacement Options and Golden Replacement Warrants, be conditionally listed on the TSX and the 
NYSE Amex, and that the Golden Replacement February 2009 Warrants issued to ECU Warrantholders pursuant to the 
Arrangement be conditionally listed on the TSX.
Distribution and Resales of Securities
The issue of Golden Stock, Golden Replacement Options, Golden Replacements Warrants and ECU Replacement Notes 
pursuant  to  the  Arrangement,  including  the  issue  of  Golden  Stock  on  the  exercise  of  Golden  Replacement  Options  and 
Golden  Replacement  Warrants,  will  constitute  distributions  of  securities  which  are  exempt  from  the  prospectus 
requirements of the Canadian Securities Laws. The Golden Stock, Golden Replacement Options and Golden Replacement 
Warrants  issued  pursuant  to  the  Arrangement,  including  the  Golden  Stock  issuable  upon  the  exercise  of  the  Golden 
Replacement Options and Golden Replacement Warrants, may be resold in any province or territory of Canada, provided 
that: (i) Golden is a reporting issuer in a jurisdiction of Canada for the four months immediately preceding the trade; (ii) the 
trade is not a “control distribution” as defined in NI 45-102, (iii) no unusual effort is made to prepare the market or create a 
demand for those securities, (iv) no extraordinary commission or consideration is paid in respect of that sale, and (v) if the 
selling security holder is an insider or officer of Golden, the insider or officer has no reasonable grounds to believe that 
Golden is in default of Canadian Securities Laws.  As Golden will apply to have ECU cease to be a reporting issuer within 
Canada  after  the  Arrangement,  the  ECU  Replacement  Notes  may  not  be  resold  within  Canada  except  pursuant  to  an 
exemption from the prospectus requirements of applicable Canadian Securities Laws.
Each ECU Securityholder is urged to consult the holder’s professional advisors with respect to restrictions applicable to 
trades in Golden Stock under Canadian Securities Laws.
Requirement for Minority Approval under MI 61-101
ECU is a reporting issuer (or the equivalent) under securities legislation in each of the provinces of Canada and is, among 
other things, subject to MI 61-101. MI 61-101 is intended to regulate insider bids, issuer bids, business combinations and 
related party transactions to ensure that all securityholders are treated in a manner that is fair and perceived to be fair by 
requiring, among other things, enhanced disclosure, review and approval processes. It is expected that Mr. Michel Roy, 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ECU, and Mr. Stephen J. Altmann, President  of ECU,  will receive change of 
control bonus payments in connection with the Arrangement as described under “The Arrangement – Interests of Directors 
and  Officers  of  ECU  in  the  Arrangement”  in  this  Circular.  Such  payments  will  constitute  a  “collateral  benefit”  under
- 105 -
Please contact Kingsdale Shareholder Services Inc. at 1-877-659-1819
if you have any questions, or require assistance completing your Proxy.
MI 61-101.  Accordingly,  the  Arrangement  constitutes  a  “business combination”  for  the  purposes  of  MI 61-101,  thereby 
requiring ECU to obtain “minority approval” of the Arrangement from ECU Shareholders.
Pursuant to MI 61-101, in determining whether minority approval for the Arrangement has been obtained, ECU is required 
to exclude the votes attaching to the ECU Shares beneficially owned or controlled by “interested parties” (being Mr. Roy 
and Mr. Altmann) and their “related parties” and “joint actors”, all as defined in MI 61-101. Accordingly, the Arrangement 
Resolution must be passed by a simple majority of the votes cast thereon by ECU Shareholders, excluding the votes cast in 
respect  of  ECU  Shares  beneficially  owned  or  over  which  control  or  direction  is  exercised  by  Mr.  Michel  Roy  and  Mr. 
Stephen J. Altmann and their respective related parties or joint actors.
MI  61-101  excludes  certain  benefits  from  the  meaning  of  “collateral  benefit”,  including,  among  others,  a  benefit  to  a 
director or senior officer where (i) the benefit is not conferred for the purpose, in whole or in part, of increasing the value of 
the consideration paid to the director or senior officer for securities relinquished under the transaction; (ii) the benefit is not, 
by its terms, conditional on the director or senior officer supporting the transaction in any manner; (iii) full particulars of 
the benefit are disclosed in the disclosure document for the transaction; and (iv) at the date of the transaction was entered 
into the director or senior officer and his or her associated entities beneficially own, or exercise control or direction over, 
less than 1% of the outstanding securities of each class of equity securities of the issuer.
To the knowledge of ECU, Mr. Roy and Mr. Altmann are the only directors or senior officers  who, together  with their 
associated entities, beneficially owned or exercised control or direction over more than 1% of the ECU Shares as calculated 
in accordance with MI 61-101 (which included such number of ECU Shares that would be issuable if the ECU Options held 
by  Mr.  Roy  or  Mr.  Altmann  were  fully  exercised)  outstanding  as  at  June  24,  2011,  being  the  date  the  Arrangement 
Agreement was entered into. As noted under the heading “The Arrangement – Interests of Directors and Officers of ECU in 
the Arrangement” in this Circular, Mr. Roy, together with his associated entities, holds, directly or indirectly, or exercises 
control  or  direction  over,  2,960,826  ECU  Shares  and  4,370,000  ECU  Options,  and  Mr.  Altmann,  together  with  his 
associated entities, holds, directly or indirectly, or exercises control or direction over, 42,500 ECU Shares and 4,800,000
ECU Options.
U.S. Securities Laws
The  following  discussion  is  a  general  overview  of  certain  requirements  of  U.S.  federal  and  state  securities  laws 
applicable to ECU Securityholders.  All ECU Securityholders are urged to consult with their own legal advisors to 
ensure that the resale of Golden Securities issued to them under the Arrangement complies with applicable federal 
and state securities laws. Further information applicable to U.S. Securityholders is disclosed in this Circular under 
“Note to United States Securityholders”.
Exemption from the Registration Requirements of the U.S. Securities Act
The Golden Securities to be issued by Golden pursuant to the Arrangement will not be registered under the U.S. Securities 
Act  or  the  securities  laws  of  any  state  of  the  United  States  and  will  be  effected  in  reliance  on  the  Section  3(a)(10) 
Exemption and exemptions provided under the securities laws of each state of the United States. Section 3(a)(l0) of the U.S. 
Securities Act exempts from registration securities which are issued in exchange for outstanding securities where the terms 
and conditions of such issue and exchange are approved, after a hearing upon the fairness of such terms and conditions at 
which  all  persons  to  whom  it  is  proposed  to  issue  securities  in  such  exchange  have  the  right  to  appear,  by  a  court  or 
governmental  authority  expressly  authorized  by  Law  to  grant  such  approval.  The  SEC  generally  recognizes  exchanges 
effected under a Canadian plan of arrangement as qualifying for the Section 3(a)(10) Exemption. Accordingly, the Final 
Order, if granted, will constitute a basis for the exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act with 
respect to the Golden Securities issued in connection with the Arrangement.
Resales of Golden Stock Issued to ECU Shareholders
The restrictions on resale of the Golden Stock issued to ECU Shareholders imposed by the U.S. Securities Act will depend 
on whether the ECU Shareholder is an “affiliate” of Golden within 90 days prior to the Effective Time. As defined in Rule 
144 under the U.S. Securities Act, an “affiliate” of an issuer is a person that directly or indirectly through one or  more 
intermediaries,  controls,  or  is  controlled  by,  or  is  under  common  control  with,  the  issuer.  Typically,  persons  who  are
- 106 -

if you have any questions, or require assistance completing your Proxy.
executive officers, directors or 10% or greater shareholders of an issuer are considered to be its “affiliates”. The resale rules 
applicable to ECU Shareholders are summarized below. ECU Shareholders who are not affiliates of Golden within 90 days 
before the Effective Time and who will not be affiliates of Golden after the Effective Time may resell the Golden Stock 
issued to them upon closing of the Arrangement in the United States without restriction under the U.S. Securities Act.
ECU  Shareholders  who  are  or  have  been  affiliates  of  Golden  within  90  days  before  the  Effective  Time  or  who  will  be 
affiliates of Golden after the Effective Time will be subject to restrictions on resale imposed by the U.S. Securities Act with 
respect to Golden Stock issued at the Effective Time. These affiliates may not resell their Golden Stock unless such shares 
are  registered  under  the  U.S.  Securities  Act  or  an  exemption  from  registration  is  available.  Affiliates  may  resell  their 
Golden Stock in accordance with the provisions of Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act, including compliance with the 
current public information requirements, the applicable holding period, and the volume and manner of sale limitations.
Resales of Golden Replacement Warrants  Issued to ECU Warrantholders
The  restrictions  on  resale  of  the  Golden  Replacement  Warrants  issued  to  ECU  Warrantholders  imposed  by  the  U.S. 
Securities  Act  will  depend  on  whether  the  ECU  Warrantholder  is  an  “affiliate”  of  Golden  within  90  days  prior  to  the 
Effective Time. As defined in Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act, an “affiliate” of an issuer is a person that directly or 
indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, the issuer. 
Typically, persons who are executive officers, directors or 10% or greater shareholders of an issuer are considered to be its 
“affiliates”. The resale rules applicable to ECU Warrantholders are summarized below. ECU Warrantholders who are not 
affiliates of Golden within 90 days before the Effective Time and who will not be affiliates of Golden after the Effective 
Time may resell the Golden Replacement Warrants issued to them upon closing of the Arrangement in the United States 
without restriction under the U.S. Securities Act.
ECU Warrantholders who are or have been affiliates of Golden within 90 days before the Effective Time or who will be 
affiliates of Golden after the Effective Time will be subject to restrictions on resale imposed by the U.S. Securities Act with 
respect  to  Golden  Replacement  Warrants  issued  at  the  Effective  Time.  These  affiliates  may  not  resell  their  Golden 
Replacement  Warrants  unless  such  Golden  Replacement  Warrants  are  registered  under  the  U.S.  Securities  Act  or  an 
exemption from registration is available. Affiliates may resell their Golden Replacement Warrants in accordance with the 
provisions  of  Rule  144  under  the  U.S.  Securities  Act,  including  compliance  with  the  current  public  information 
requirements, the applicable holding period, and the volume and manner of sale limitations.
Resales of Golden Replacement Options after the Completion of the Arrangement
The Golden Replacement Options issuable in connection  with the  Arrangement are not transferable, in accordance  with 
their terms, other than by will or the Laws of succession and distribution.
Issuance and Resale of Golden Stock Upon Exercise of Golden Replacement Securities
The  Golden  Stock  issuable  upon  exercise  of  the  Golden  Replacement  Securities  has  not  been  registered  under  the  U.S. 
Securities  Act  or  under  applicable  state  securities  laws.    As  a  result,  the  Golden  Replacement  Securities  may  not  be 
exercised by or on behalf of a person in the United States or a U.S. Person, and the Golden Stock issuable upon exercise 
thereof in the United States or by a U.S. Person may not be offered or resold unless such securities have been registered 
under the U.S. Securities Act and the securities laws of all applicable states of the United States or an exemption from such 
registration requirements is available. Golden has agreed that on or prior to the Effective Time, it shall use commercially 
reasonable efforts to (i) prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or amended Form S-8) with 
respect to the shares of Golden Stock issuable upon exercise or settlement, from time to time, of the Golden Replacement 
Options  and  (ii)  file  a  shelf  registration  statement  (or  amend  an  existing  shelf  registration  statement)  with  the  SEC 
registering under the U.S. Securities Act the issuance of the Golden Stock upon exercise, from time to time, of the Golden 
Replacement Warrants and have such registration statement (or amended registration statement) declared effective.

DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES INVOLVED IN THE ARRANGEMENT
ECU Shares
ECU’s authorized share structure consists of an unlimited number of ECU Shares without par value. The holders of ECU 
Shares are entitled to one vote per share at all meetings of ECU Shareholders, except for meetings at which only the holders 
of shares of another class or of a particular series are entitled to vote separately as a class or series.
The holders of ECU Shares are entitled to receive dividends if, as and when declared by the ECU Board. In the event of the 
dissolution, liquidation, winding-up or other distribution of ECU’s assets, such holders are entitled to receive on a pro rata 
basis all of ECU’s assets remaining after payment of all  of ECU’s liabilities. The ECU Shares carry no pre-emptive or 
conversion rights.
Provisions as to the modification, amendment or variation of the rights attached to the ECU Shares are contained in the 
QBCA.    Generally,  all  changes  to  the  authorized  share  structure  require  an  amendment  to  the  articles  of  ECU  that  is 
authorized  pursuant  to  a  resolution  approved  by  at  least  two-thirds  of  the  votes  cast  at  a  meeting  of  ECU  Shareholders
entitled to vote on the resolution.
The transfer agent and registrar for the ECU Shares is Computershare at its principal offices in Montreal, Québec, Canada.
The ECU Shares are listed for trading on the TSX under the symbol “ECU”. The closing price of the ECU Shares on the 
TSX  on  July  28,  2011  was  Cdn$0.72,  and  the  closing  price  of  the  ECU  Shares  on  the  TSX  on  June  23,  2011,  the  last 
trading day prior to the date of announcement of the proposed Arrangement, was Cdn$1.04.
Dividends
Since January 1, 2008, ECU has not declared or paid any dividends or made any distributions on the ECU Shares.
Golden Stock
Golden’s  authorized  capital  stock  consists  of  50,000,000  shares  of  Golden  Stock,  par  value  US$0.01  per  share,  and 
10,000,000  shares  of  preferred  stock,  par  value  US$0.01  per  share.    Golden  is  seeking  the  approval  of  the  Golden 
Stockholders  at  the  Golden  Meeting  to  increase  the  number  of  shares  of  its  authorized  Golden  Stock  from  50,000,000 
shares to 100,000,000 shares pursuant to the Golden Charter Amendment Proposal.
Each  holder  of  Golden  Stock  is  entitled  to  one  vote  per  share.  Subject  to  the  rights  of  the  holders  of  any  outstanding 
preferred stock, all voting rights are vested in the holders of shares of Golden Stock. Holders of shares of Golden Stock 
have  non-cumulative  voting  rights,  meaning  that  the  holders  of  more  than  50%  of  the  shares  voting  for  the  election  of 
directors  will  be  able  to  elect  100%  of  the  directors,  and  the  holders  of  the  remaining  shares  voting  for  the  election  of 
directors will not be able to elect any directors.
Holders  of  Golden  Stock  are  entitled  to  receive  dividends  when,  as  and  if  declared  by  the  Golden  Board,  out  of  funds 
legally available for their payment, subject to the rights of holders of any outstanding preferred stock.
In the event of Golden’s voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of Golden Stock will 
be entitled to share equally in any of assets available for distribution after the payment in full of all debts and distributions 
and after the holders of outstanding preferred stock, if any, have received their liquidation preferences in full.
Under  Delaware  law,  a  stockholder  is  not  entitled  to  pre-emptive  rights  to  subscribe  for  additional  issuances  of  Golden 
Stock or any other class or series of Golden Stock or any security convertible into such stock in proportion to the shares that 
are owned unless there is a provision to the contrary in the certificate of incorporation. Golden’s Amended and Restated 
Certificate of Incorporation does not provide its stockholders with any pre-emptive or similar rights.
The transfer agent and registrar for Golden Stock is Computershare, at its offices in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Golden  Stock  is  listed  for  trading  on  the  TSX  under  the  symbol  “AUM”  and  on  the  NYSE  Amex  under  the  symbol 
“AUMN”. The closing price of Golden Stock on the TSX on July 28, 2011 was Cdn$13.93, and the closing price of the 
Golden  Stock  on  the  TSX  on  June  23,  2011,  the  last  trading  day  prior  to  the  date  of  announcement  of  the  proposed 
Arrangement, was Cdn$19.38.
Golden has applied to list the shares of Golden Stock to be issued in exchange for ECU Shares under the Arrangement, and 
the  shares  of  Golden  Stock  issuable  upon  the  exercise  of  the  Golden  Replacement  Options  and  Golden  Replacement 
Warrants, on the TSX and on the NYSE Amex. Such listings will be subject to Golden fulfilling all the listing requirements 
of the TSX and the NYSE Amex, respectively.
Dividends
Golden  has  never  declared  or  paid  any  cash  dividends  on  the  Golden  Stock  and  does  not  anticipate  paying  any  cash 
dividends on the Golden Stock in the foreseeable future. Golden currently intends to retain all future earnings, if any, to 
fund the development and growth of its business. The Golden Board’s ability to declare a dividend is also subject to limits 
imposed by Delaware corporate law.
ECU Options
ECU has adopted the ECU Stock Option Plan pursuant to which the ECU Board can distribute ECU Options to acquire 
ECU  Shares  to  its  directors,  officers,  employees  and  consultants.  The  conditions  and  the  exercise  price  of  every  ECU 
Option are determined by the members of the ECU Board.
Pursuant to the ECU Stock Option Plan, ECU has reserved an aggregate of 14,252,398 ECU Shares for issuance pursuant to 
the exercise of ECU Options. The ECU Stock Option Plan provides that (i) the maximum number of ECU Shares which 
may be reserved for issuance pursuant to the ECU Stock Option Plan to any one beneficiary in any 12-month period may 
not exceed 5% of the number of ECU Shares then issued and outstanding, and (ii) the maximum number of ECU Shares 
which  may be reserved, in the aggregate,  for issuance pursuant to  the ECU  Stock Option Plan to beneficiaries  who  are 
conducting  investor  relations  activities  in  any  12-month  period  may  not  exceed  2%  of  the  number  of  ECU  Shares  then 
issued and outstanding. The exercise price of ECU Options granted under the ECU Stock Option Plan is not permitted to be 
less than the closing price of the ECU Shares on the day preceding the grant of the ECU Options, less any discount allowed 
by applicable securities legislation. ECU Options granted pursuant to the ECU Stock Option Plan must have an exercise 
period of no more than 10 years, or such lesser period as may be imposed by applicable securities legislation.
Holders of ECU Options do not have any voting or other rights which a holder of ECU Shares would have, except that such 
holders will have the right to vote at the Meeting in respect of the Arrangement. See “The Arrangement – Securityholder 
and Court Approvals – Securityholder Approval”.
Golden Replacement Options
The  Golden  Replacement  Options  will  be  issued  pursuant  to  the  Golden  Replacement  Option  Plan.  Pursuant  to  the 
Arrangement,  ECU  Optionholders  will  receive  Golden  Replacement  Options  in  replacement  of  their  outstanding  ECU 
Options, in respect of which the number of underlying shares of Golden Stock, the expiry date and the exercise price shall 
be  determined  in  accordance  with  the  Plan  of  Arrangement  (see  “The  Arrangement  –  Terms  of  the  Arrangement”  for 
details).    The  terms  and  conditions  otherwise  applicable  to  Golden  Replacement  Options  shall  be  those  set  forth  in  the 
Golden Replacement Option Plan, which terms and conditions shall be substantially the same as those of the ECU Stock 
Option  Plan  (summarized  immediately  above  under  the  subheading  “ECU  Options”),  except  for  such  changes  as  are 
required  under  applicable  Law  or  stock  exchange  rules  and  such  changes  as  are  contemplated  by  the  Arrangement 
Agreement (including that Golden Replacement Options shall be exercisable for shares of Golden Stock as opposed to ECU 
Shares).  The  Golden  Replacement  Option  Plan  will  be  established  solely  for  the  purpose  of  issuing  and  governing  the 
Golden Replacement Options pursuant to the Arrangement; thereafter, no additional Golden Replacement Options will be 
granted pursuant to the Golden Replacement Option Plan.

February 2009 Warrants
The February 2009 Warrants were issued pursuant to the February 2009 Warrant Indenture. The following is a summary of 
the material attributes and characteristics of the February 2009 Warrants, and does not purport to be complete and is subject 
to,  and  qualified  in  its  entirety  by,  reference  to  the  terms  of  the  February  2009  Warrant  Indenture,  a  copy  of  which  is 
available through the SEDAR website at www.sedar.com, under ECU’s profile.
Each whole February 2009 Warrant entitles its holder to acquire, subject to adjustment as summarized below, one ECU 
Share at an exercise price of Cdn$0.95 on or before 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on February 20, 2014, after which time the 
February 2009 Warrant will be void and of no value.
The February 2009 Warrant Indenture provides that the share ratio and exercise price of the February 2009 Warrants are 
subject  to  adjustment  in  the  event  of  a  subdivision  or  consolidation  of  the  ECU  Shares.  The  February  2009  Warrant 
Indenture  also  provides  that  if  there  is  (a)  any  reclassification  or  change  of  the  ECU  Shares,  (b)  any  consolidation, 
amalgamation, arrangement or other business combination of ECU resulting in any reclassification or change of the ECU 
Shares into other shares, or (c) any sale, lease, exchange or transfer of the assets of ECU as an entirety or substantially as an 
entirety to another entity, then each holder of a February 2009 Warrant which is thereafter exercised shall receive, in lieu of 
ECU Shares, the kind and number or amount of other securities or property which such holder would have been entitled to 
receive as a result of such event if such holder had exercised the February 2009 Warrants prior to the event.
ECU also covenants in the February 2009 Warrant Indenture that, during the period in which the February 2009 Warrants 
are  exercisable,  it  will  give  notice  to  holders  of  February  2009  Warrants  of  certain  stated  events,  including  events  that 
would result in an adjustment to the exercise price of the February 2009 Warrants or the number of ECU Shares issuable 
upon exercise of the February 2009 Warrants, at least 14 days prior to the record date or effective date, as the case may be, 
of such events.
No  fractional  ECU  Shares  are  issuable  upon  the  exercise  of  any  February  2009  Warrants,  and  no  cash  or  other 
consideration will be paid in lieu of fractional shares. Holders of February 2009 Warrants do not have any voting or pre-
emptive rights or any other rights which a holder of ECU Shares would have, except that such holders will have the right to

ECU Convertible Notes and ECU Replacement Notes
A  summary  description  of  the  ECU  Convertible  Notes  is  included  in  this  Circular  under  “The  Arrangement  –  Private 
Placement”. Pursuant to the Arrangement, the ECU Convertible Noteholder will receive ECU Replacement Notes that are 
identical to the ECU Convertible Notes except that they will not be convertible into ECU Shares (or any other securities).
Holders  of  ECU  Convertible  Notes  do  not  have  any  voting  or  other  rights  which  a  holder  of  ECU  Shares  would  have, 
except that such holders will have the right to vote at the Meeting in respect of the Arrangement. See “The Arrangement –
Securityholder and Court Approvals – Securityholder Approval”.
COMPARISON OF SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS UNDER THE QBCA AND DELAWARE LAW
Upon completion of the Arrangement, ECU Shareholders will no longer be shareholders of ECU  and  will  instead  hold 
shares of Golden Stock. Quebec Law and ECU’s articles of incorporation and by-laws govern ECU and its relations 
with its shareholders. Delaware Law and Golden’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws  govern Golden (and will 
govern the Combined Company) and its relations with its stockholders.
Although  the  rights  and  privileges  of  stockholders  of  a  Delaware  corporation  are,  in  many  instances, 
comparable to those of shareholders of a corporation organized under the QBCA, there are several differences. Attached 
at Appendix H to this Circular is a summary of the material differences in the rights of holders of ECU Shares and 
holders of shares of Golden Stock. These differences arise from the differences between the General Corporation Law of 
the State of Delaware  (the  “DGCL”)  and  the  QBCA  and  between  the  ECU  articles  of  incorporation  and  by-
laws and Golden’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws. This summary included at Appendix H is not intended to be 
complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the DGCL, the QBCA and the governing corporate instruments of 
ECU and Golden.

Overview
ECU is a Canadian-based mining company, actively engaged in gold, silver, lead and zinc exploration, mining and milling 
since 1997. ECU has a cluster of five mines in the historically prolific Velardeña Mining District of Central Mexico, where 
it has had a series of major discoveries.
ECU  has  three  major  properties  within  close  proximity  comprising  the  Velardeña  District  Properties.  These  are  the 
Velardeña Property, the Chicago Property and the San Diego Property (a 50% joint venture). The properties are located in 
Durango  State,  central  Mexico,  situated  approximately  95  kilometres  south-southwest  of  the  city  of  Torreón,  Coahuila 
State, and 140 kilometres northeast of the state capital Durango.
The MICON ECU Technical Report identifies a measured and indicated resource of 4 million tonnes containing 40 million 
ounces  of  silver-equivalent  and  an  inferred  resource  of  26  million  tonnes  containing  391  million  ounces  of  silver-
equivalent. ECU mines mineralized stope material from its mines and treats them at its wholly owned milling facilities.
ECU  has  a  340  tonne  per  day  flotation  mill  (the  “Sulphide  Mill”)  in  the  Village  of  Velardeña,  where  it  treats  its 
mineralized sulphide material to generate a lead/silver concentrate, a zinc concentrate, and a pyrite/gold concentrate. ECU 
also  owns  a  500  tonne  per  day  cyanide  leach  mill  (the  “Oxide  Mill”)  adjacent  to  the  Chicago  Property,  where  it  treats 
mineralized oxide material to generate silver/gold doré bars.
History
ECU’s  Velardeña  District  Properties  are  host  to  a  large  mineral  resource,  rich  in  gold  and  silver  and  rich  in  history. 
Historically,  the  450-year  old  mining  district  of  Velardeña  has  produced  over  500,000  ounces  of  gold  and  250  million 
ounces of silver.
In the early 1900s, the American Smelting and Refining Company (Asarco) was active in the area, until low metal prices 
and political instability forced it to close in 1926. From that point up until the early 1990s, the area was operated by various 
small-scale, local miners. In 1994, William Resources Inc. acquired claims over the area. Three years later, in 1997, ECU 
acquired 93.4% of William Resources Inc.’s Mexican subsidiary BLM Minera Mexicana S.A. de C.V. which owned 100% 
of the Velardeña Property.
More recently, the Velardeña District Properties have been subject to aggressive exploration that consists of over 400 drill 
holes and over 72 kilometres of drilling. This exploration effort has led to the discovery of several new veins, as well as the 
lateral and depth extension of several existing high grade veins.

Exploration
Overview
Exploration on the Velardeña District Properties has been ongoing for several years. Major discoveries of gold and silver 
have been found through the expertise and experience of ECU’s team of senior mining professionals who have worked at 
developing and exploring  for  mineralized  material at the  Velardeña District Properties  ∀- a  known but under-exploited 
mineral bearing region in Mexico’s silver belt.
The team has established ECU as having a significant presence in precious and base metals through an exploration drilling 
program  that  has uncovered  major new discoveries. Expertise in the local geological  model of  mineralization  led to the 
discovery of several mineral-rich veins, metals-bearing skarns, stockwork zones of sheeted veins and deep seated massive 
sulphide intercepts at depth.
Location
The Velardeña District Properties are a group of three properties held by ECU within the Velardeña Mining District. The 
three properties are the Velardeña Property, the Chicago Property and the San Diego Property.
The Velardeña District Properties are located in the Velardeña Mining District, within the municipality of Cuencamé, in the 
northeast quadrant of the State of Durango, Mexico. The property is situated approximately 95 km southwest of the city of 
Torreón in the State of Coahuila and 140 km northeast of the city of Durango, capital of the State of Durango.
The  Velardeña  Property  is  located  at  latitude  and  longitude  coordinates  25  4’  34”N  and  103  41’  43”W.  This  property 
contains  the  Santa  Juana  mine,  which  has  been  the  focus  of  ECU’s  mining  efforts  since  1995,  as  well  as  the  historical 
Terneras, San Juanes and San Mateo mines.
The Chicago Property is located approximately 1-2 km south of the Velardeña Property and is centred at coordinates 25 3’ 
42”N and 103 41’ 46”. This property contains the historical Los Muertos-Chicago mine, the extension of which is being 
drilled by ECU.
The San Diego Property is situated approximately 9 km northeast of the Velardeña Property. It is approximately centred at 
co-ordinates 25 6’ 7”N and 103 37’ 19”. This property contains the historical La Cruz-La Rata and El Trovador mines as 
well as a number of other shallower shafts which were sunk on narrower veins such as the Cantarranas, Montanez and El 
Jal. The San Diego property is also subject to a joint venture agreement between ECU and Golden Tag Resources Ltd.
ECU holds the Velardeña District Properties through its Mexican subsidiary Minera William S.A. de C.V.  At present, the 
three properties comprise a total of 32 mineral concessions (20 for the Velardeña Property, 8 for the Chicago Property and 4 
for the San Diego Property). The mineral concessions in each of the properties vary in size and the concessions comprising 
each mineral property are contiguous.
Regional Geology
The Velardeña district is located on the eastern flank of the Sierra Madre Occidental mineral belt, on the boundary between 
the Sierra Madre and the Mesa Central metallogenic provinces. Most of Mexico’s high-grade silver mines are located in the 
Mesa Central province, near this contact.
The  regional  geology  is  characterized  by  a  thick  sequence  of  limestones  and  minor  calcareous  clastic  sediments  of 
Cretaceous  age,  intruded  by  Tertiary  plutons  of  acid  to  intermediate  composition.  During  the  Laramide  Orogeny,  the 
sediments  were  folded  into  symmetrical  anticlines  and  synclines  that  were  modified  into  a  series  of  asymmetrical 
overturned  folds  by  a  later  stage  of  compression.  This  event  also  buckled  the  stratigraphy  about  a  southwest  striking, 
vertically dipping hinge-line around the village of Velardeña.
A  series  of  felsic  to  intermediate  intrusive  rocks  occurs  over  a  strike  length  of  approximately  15  kilometres,  possibly 
located  along  the  hinge-line  mentioned  above.  Local  development  of  exoskarn,  endoskarn,  hornfels  and  marble  occur

associated with the intrusives. The mineralization at the Santa Maria Mine in Velardeña and all of the various workings on 
and around the property occurs along this trend and is spatially associated with the intrusives and related alteration.
Mineral Resources
The resource estimate in respect of the Velardeña District Properties was audited by MICON in connection with preparing 
the MICON ECU Technical Report.
Mineral resources in the measured and indicated category equal 293,000 ounces of gold, 16.1 million ounces of silver, 26.2 
million pounds of lead and 36.7 million pounds of zinc which translates into 40 million ounces of silver equivalent. In the 
inferred category, mineral resources equal 1.8 million ounces of gold, 248.1 million ounces of silver, 1 billion pounds of 
lead and 1.2 billion pounds of zinc for an inferred mineral inventory of 391 million ounces of silver equivalent.
The resource estimate is based on 46 veins and includes the sum of mineral resources from the main Velardeña Property, 
the Chicago Property and 50% of the joint venture San Diego Property. All of these properties are within close proximity to 
each other. Additional veins at Velardeña, which are well known and have been identified through surface sampling and/or 
underground workings, require further evaluation. It is anticipated that more veins exist in the Velardeña District Properties 
based on past geological mapping.
A cut-off value of US$45 per tonne (166 grams per tonne) was used for the narrow veins and was based on information 
derived from previous mining activities on the main Velardeña Property. A cut-off value of US$25 per tonne (92 grams per 
tonne) was used for the bulk tonnage vein packages and was based on previous bulk mining tests completed by ECU. In 
determining  the  silver  equivalent  value,  the  net  smelter  return  value  was  calculated  for  each  commodity  based  on 
metallurgical recoveries from the most recent tests and contracts for mineral concentrates treated from the mining activities 
on the Velardeña Property.
The Qualified Persons within the meaning of NI 43-101 responsible for the evaluation of the resource estimate are William 
J. Lewis, B.Sc., P. Geo., a senior geologist  with MICON, and Michel  Roy, P. Geo., the Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer of ECU.
Cautionary Statements:
Readers are cautioned that there are no assurances that all or any part of the resource estimate will be economically viable 
and  although  the  information  in  this  Circular  is  based  on  the  best  available  data  ECU  has  collected  to  date,  a  material 
difference between the actual results and ECU’s expectations may arise once further exploration is completed.
Until a pre-feasibility study (within the meaning of the CIM Standards) is completed, there are no assurances the release of 
an updated mineral resource will be economically viable.
Mining Operations
ECU’s  mining  operations  are  exclusively  underground  mining  operations  where  ECU’s  team  of  experienced  miners  are 
extracting mineralized material from rich, high grade mineralized veins.
There are two principal phases of underground mining: development mining and production mining. Development mining 
is  composed  of  excavation  almost  entirely  in  (low-value)  waste  rock  in  order  to  gain  access  to  the  mineralized  veins. 
Production mining is the removal of the wanted high grade material from the underground mine leaving behind an open 
space known as a stope.
Milling Operations
ECU has two wholly-owned operating mills located close to its mines near the village of Velardeña, Durango, Mexico.
The first of the mills is a cyanidation leach plant, the Oxide Mill, with a Merrill Crowe circuit at a rated capacity of 500 
tonnes per day. This Oxide Mill is used for the treatment of ECU’s oxide resources and generates gold/silver doré bars.
- 115 -

if you have any questions, or require assistance completing your Proxy.
The second mill is a flotation mill, the Sulphide Mill, with a rated capacity of 340 tonnes per day that treats ECU’s sulphide 
resource.  The  Sulphide  Mill  generates  three  concentrates;  a  lead/silver  concentrate,  a  zinc  concentrate  and  a  pyrite/gold 
concentrate.
Cyanide Leach Mill
ECU  owns  a  conventional  cyanide  leach  mill  with  a  Merrill  Crowe  precipitation  circuit.  It  is  ideally  suited  to  process 
ECU’s oxide material and gold-pyrite concentrate inventory. ECU generates gold/silver doré bars from the mill which is 
sold to a third party refinery. The mill has a capacity to process mineralized material up to 500 tonnes per day.
The  mill  is  located  only  two  kilometres  from  ECU’s  Santa  Juana  mine  site  and  immediately  adjacent  to  its  Chicago 
Property. The close proximity of the mill to ECU’s mining operations gives ECU a significant advantage with respect to 
transportation of mineralized material.
The  mill  employs  a  cyanide  leaching  process  which  uses  a  cyanide  solution  to  dissolve  gold  from  host  rocks  for  later 
precipitation.  Mineralized  material  is  mined  from  ECU’s  underground  mines.  After  the  mineralized  material  has  been 
excavated, it is brought to a grinding mill, where the mineralized material is crushed into sand or smaller sized grains. Next, 
it is transported to the leaching plant where the mineralized material is mixed with a cyanide solution. The cyanide solution 
dissolves the gold from the crushed mineralized material. Next, the gold-bearing solution is collected. Finally, the gold is 
precipitated out of solution.
ECU’s method of precipitation is the Merrill Crowe recovery process where a different metal, zinc, is added to the solution. 
The added metal dissolves and causes the gold to precipitate out of solution. The precipitate is collected, melted and poured 
into a doré bar. The impurities are later removed in a refinery.
Flotation Mill
ECU owns a 340 tonnes per day flotation mill situated near the town of Velardeña which has been extensively upgraded. 
The mill has a fully operational lead/silver and zinc flotation circuit plus a pyrite/gold circuit to recover  more gold and 
silver from the sulphide material.
All the equipment necessary to operate the mills from the initial crushing circuit to grinding and then flotation is available. 
The  main  buildings  hosting  this  equipment  are  open  to  the  environment,  because  of  the  local  climate,  and  they  have 
ancillary buildings for warehousing, offices and maintenance as well as a fully functional laboratory to perform fire and 
atomic absorption (AA) assaying.
The mill treats  mineralized  material  which has been collected from ECU’s  mines. Lead/silver and zinc concentrates are 
generated from the mineralized material and sold to interested smelters in Mexico or abroad. The remaining material flows 
through a pyrite/gold circuit to enhance recoveries of the precious metals and creates a pyrite-arsenopyrite-gold concentrate 
that can either be sold as is, or roasted and then sold as an iron-gold concentrate, or run through a cyanide leach plant to 
recover the precious metal contents.

In July 2011, ECU issued 3,000,000 ECU Shares as payment for the exercise of an option to purchase an exploration 
property.  The  purchase  price  was  negotiated  in  January  2000  as  3,000,000  ECU  Shares,  irrespective  of  the  current 
trading value of the ECU Shares on the TSX at the time of exercising the option to purchase.
In July 2011, ECU closed the Private Placement of the ECU Convertible Notes with Golden. See “The Arrangement –
Private Placement” for more details.
In May 2011, ECU closed a private placement of 4,000,000 ECU Shares, at a price of Cdn$0.65 per share, for gross 
proceeds of Cdn$2,600,000.
In December 2009, ECU closed a private placement of 16,946,000 special warrants (for the purposes of this paragraph, 
the “Special Warrants”), at a price of Cdn$0.72 per Special Warrant, for a gross proceeds of Cdn$12,201,120. Each 
Special Warrant entitled the holder thereof to receive, without the payment of additional consideration, one unit on the 
exercise  or  deemed  exercise  of  the  Special  Warrant.  Each  such  unit  comprised  one  ECU  Share  and  one-half  of  a 
December 2009 Warrant, and each whole December 2009 Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one ECU Share at an 
exercise price of Cdn$0.90 per share at any time before December 9, 2011. On final receipt for a short form prospectus

Overview of Golden
Golden  is  a  mineral  exploration  company  with  a  diversified  portfolio  of  precious  metals  and  other  mineral  exploration 
properties located in or near the traditional precious metals producing regions of Mexico and South America.
Golden was incorporated in Delaware under the Delaware General Corporation Law in March 2009, and is the successor to 
Apex  Silver  Mines  Limited  (“Apex  Silver”)  for  purposes  of  reporting  under  the  U.S.  Exchange  Act.    In  January  2009, 
Apex  Silver  and  its  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Apex  Silver  Mines  Corporation,  filed  voluntary  petitions  for  relief  under 
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In connection with its Joint Plan of Reorganization, Apex Silver sold its interest 
in  the  San  Cristóbal  mine  in  Bolivia  to  the  Sumitomo  Corporation  (“Sumitomo”).  Substantially  all  of  Apex  Silver’s 
remaining assets, including its various subsidiaries that hold a broad portfolio of exploration properties, were assigned to 
Golden.

Golden’s  principal  offices  are  located  in  Golden,  Colorado  at  350  Indiana  Street,  Suite  800,  Golden,  CO  80401  and  its 
registered  office  is  the  Corporation  Trust  Company,  1209 Orange  Street,  Wilmington,  DE  19801.  Golden  also  maintain 
exploration offices in Argentina, Mexico and Peru.
Golden Stock is listed for trading on the TSX under the symbol “AUM” and the NYSE Amex under the symbol “AUMN”.
Corporate Structure
Golden and its  wholly-owned subsidiary Golden Services  Corporation, both headquartered in Golden, Colorado, are the 
operating  entities  through  which  Golden  conducts  its  business.  Golden  also  wholly-owns  a  number  of  subsidiaries 
organized throughout the world, including in Canada, Mexico, Central America, South America, the Caribbean, Europe and 
Australia.  Golden generally holds its exploration rights and properties through subsidiaries organized in the countries in 
which such rights and properties are located.
Strategy and Objectives
Golden’s business strategy is to discover, build and operate its own mines.
Golden is currently focused on advancement of its 100% controlled El Quevar silver project in northwestern Argentina and 
engaged in additional drilling, metallurgical analysis and other advanced exploration work at El Quevar. From the inception 
of  its  exploration  activities  in  2004  through  December  31,  2010,  Golden  has  spent  approximately  US$33.3  million  on 
exploration  and  related  activities  at  El  Quevar.  In  addition  to  El  Quevar,  Golden  owns  and  controls  a  portfolio  of 
approximately 16 active exploration properties located primarily in Mexico and South America.  Golden’s 100% controlled 
Zacatecas silver and base metals project in Mexico is at an advanced stage of exploration, with six separate target areas on 
which  Golden  is  currently  conducting  exploration  activities,  including  drilling  at  the  Pánuco  target.  Golden  also  has 
reconnaissance  properties  on  which  it  is  conducting  preliminary  sampling  and  geological  analysis  to  determine  the  best 
potential areas for more detailed exploration.
Golden’s most advanced project, the El Quevar Project, is located in the Salta Province in Argentina, a jurisdiction that has 
established  protocols  for,  and  has  historically  been  receptive  to,  mining  investment.  The  project  is  situated  in  an 
advantageous location, with nearby infrastructure, including natural gas and power, and no community in the immediate 
vicinity. Based on Golden’s exploration work to date, the Yaxtché zone, one of three currently identified primary target 
areas, appears to be a relatively high grade silver deposit.  Golden also has significant opportunity for expansion as it solely 
controls 27 concessions totaling approximately 63,000 hectares in addition to the concession on which the Yaxtché deposit 
is located.
In addition to El Quevar, Golden controls a portfolio of approximately 16 active exploration properties located primarily in 
certain traditional precious metals producing regions of Argentina, Mexico and Peru, including several focus properties in 
the Zacatecas state of Mexico.  Golden has also been successful at generating value from the sale or farm-out for cash, 
stock and/or royalties of certain properties that do not meet its minimum economic requirements for potential advancement.
El Quevar
Location and Access
Golden’s El Quevar silver project is located in the San Antonio de los Cobres municipality, Salta province, in the Altiplano 
region of northwestern Argentina, approximately 300 kilometres by road northwest of the city of Salta, the capital city of 
the province. The project is also accessible by a 300 kilometre dirt and gravel road from the city of Calama in northern 
Chile.  The small village of Pocitos, located about 20 kilometres to the west of El Quevar, is the nearest settlement. Golden 
has  established  a  camp  approximately  10  kilometres  west  of  the  project,  which  currently  houses  approximately  120 
workers.  A  high  tension  power  line  is  located  approximately  40  kilometres  from  the  site,  and  a  high  pressure  gas  line 
devoted to the  mining industry and subsidized by the Salta government is located  within 4 kilometres of the El Quevar 
camp.

The El Quevar Project is located near Nevado Peak with altitudes on the concessions ranging from 3,800 to 6,130 meters 
above sea level. The climate of the area is high mountain desert, with some precipitation in summer (as snow) and little 
snow in winter.
Property History
Mining activity in and around the El Quevar Project dates back at least 80 years. Between 1930 and 1950, there was lead 
and silver production from small workings in the area.  Golden does not have production records from that period.  The first 
organized  exploration  activities  on  the  property  occurred  during  the  1970s,  although  no  data  from  that  period  remains.  
Over  the  last  30  years,  several  companies  have  carried  out  exploration  activity  in  the  area,  including  BHP  Billiton, 
Industrias Peñoles, Mansfield Minerals and Hochschild Mining Group, consisting primarily of local sampling with some 
limited drilling programs in the area.
Title and Ownership Rights
The  El  Quevar  Project  is  comprised  of  27  concessions,  including  23  exploitation  concessions  and  four  exploration 
concessions.  In total, the El Quevar Project encompasses approximately 63,000 hectares. The area of most of Golden’s 
exploration activities at El Quevar is within the concessions that are owned or controlled by Silex Argentina S.A., Golden’s 
indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiary.    Three  of  the  concessions  near  the  primary  Yaxtché  target  are  subject  to  options  to 
purchase from the existing third-party concession owners.  One option agreement covers the El Quevar II concession and 
one-half  of  the  Castor  concession,  and  another  option  agreement  covers  the  Nevado  I  concession.    Golden’s  remaining 
payments on the El Quevar II/Castor and Nevado I option agreements total US$1,100,000 and US$1,050,000, respectively. 
Assuming  funding  is  available  and  the  results  of  Golden’s  additional  drilling  and  planned  economic  study  work  are 
promising, Golden intends to make all remaining option payments by June 22, 2012.
In addition, under the terms of the option agreements, Golden is required to pay a 1% net smelter return royalty on the 
value of all metals extracted from the El Quevar II or Nevado I concessions and one-half of the minerals extracted from the 
Castor concession. Golden is also required to pay a 3% royalty to the Salta province based on the mine mouth value of 
minerals. To maintain all of the El Quevar concessions, Golden makes yearly aggregate rental payments to the Argentine 
government of approximately US$32,000.
The surface rights at El Quevar are controlled by the Salta Province. There are no private properties within the concession 
area. To date, no issues involving surface rights have impacted the project.
Geology and Mineralization
The geology of the El Quevar Project is characterized by silver-rich veins and disseminations in Tertiary volcanic rocks that 
are part of an eroded stratovolcano.  Silver mineralization at the El Quevar Project is hosted within a broad, generally east-
west-trending structural zone and occurs as a series of north-dipping parallel sheeted vein zones, breccias and mineralized 
faults situated  within an envelope of pervasively  silicified brecciated volcanic rocks and intrusive breccias. There are at 
least  three  sub-parallel  structures  that  extend  for  an  aggregate  length  of  approximately  6.5  kilometres.  Several  volcanic 
domes  (small  intrusive  bodies)  have  been  identified  and  mineralization  is  also  found  in  breccias  associated  with  these 
domes,  especially  where  they  are  intersected  by  the  structures.  The  silver  mineralization  at  the  Yaxtché  zone  is  of 
epithermal origin. The cross-cutting nature of the mineralization, the assemblage of sulfide and alteration minerals, and the 
presence of open spaces with euhedral minerals, all point to an origin at shallow to moderate depths (a few hundred meters 
below surface) from hydrothermal solutions.
The Yaxtché deposit is one of three primary targets currently identified at the El Quevar Project. As of mid February 2011, 
Golden has completed approximately 60,865 meters of diamond drilling in 268 drill holes. Of these holes, 195 were drilled 
to  test  the  main  Yaxtché  zone  for  potential  mineralization,  with  about  66%  of  the  holes  intersecting  significant  silver 
mineralization.  Golden’s  work indicates  that the Yaxtché  central zone is at least 650 meters  in  strike length,  with  other 
drilling results to the east and west indicating a total length of more than 1,500 meters, and between 40 to 150 meters in 
width. Golden’s drilling further indicates that the silver mineralization is continuous laterally and to depths of 350 meters 
below surface in the main area.

August 2010 Technical Report
Golden continued to conduct exploratory drilling at the Yaxtché zone throughout 2010. The additional drill holes include 
infill drilling in the Yaxtché central zone and holes in the east and west extensions of the Yaxtché central zone. Utilizing 
this additional infill and step-out drilling, MICON prepared technical reports for the El Quevar Project. The report, entitled 
“NI 43-101 Technical Report and Updated Mineral Resource Estimate for the Yaxtché Silver Deposit, El Quevar Project, 
Salta Province, Argentina”, dated August 10, 2010 and prepared by William J. Lewis, BSc., P.Geo and Ing. Alan J. San 
Martin, MAusIMM (the “MICON Golden Technical Report”), was prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
SEC’s  Guide  7  and  NI  43-101,  and  was  posted  on  SEDAR  (www.sedar.com)  on  September  28,  2010  under  Golden’s 
profile.
Data  from  168  drill  holes  was  used  in  the  August  2010  estimate.  The  August  2010  resource  estimate  assumes  highly 
selective underground mining with continuity along strike and down dip supported by geologic interpretation of almost all 
holes logged to date in the mineralized zone. Golden has assumed concentration by flotation.
According to the MICON Golden Technical Report, estimated indicated and inferred resources in the Yaxtché zone at a 
cut-off grade of 100 grams of silver per tonne was as follows:
Category
Indicated
Inferred
Tonnage
901,900
4,768,300
Avg. Silver Grade (g/t)
310
336
Silver Ounces
8,991,000
51,514,000
The MICON resource estimate assumed a three meter minimum mining width, which results in a partially diluted resource 
grade of drill hole assay values. MICON also capped the grade at 3,000 grams per tonne of silver for the entire resource. 
The capping technique tends to reduce the overall grade and contained ounces.
Underground Exploration and Preliminary Economic Assessment
Golden is currently conducting additional drilling to better define the resource and constructing an underground drift to 
obtain further information on the continuity of mineralization, and ultimately to support a preliminary economic assessment 
for the El Quevar Project. Through June 30, 2011, Golden has completed more than 820 meters of development drifting in 
the Yaxtche zone at the El Quevar Project. The drifting has encountered a large number of mineralized structures believed 
to be tension faults that were not anticipated in the current model of the El Quevar deposit, in which mineral concentrations 
are  modeled  to  follow  the  alteration  envelope.    As  a  result,  Golden  has  decided  to  delay  completion  of  a  NI  43-101-
compliant Preliminary Economic Assessment and a planned mid-year 2011 resource update to allow further work to assess 
the impact that these newly discovered structures may have on the mining plan and global El Quevar resource.
As  part  of  this  effort,  Golden  is  currently  examining  the  bulk  mining  potential  of  the  Yaxtche  zone  at  El  Quevar.  
Preliminary engineering indicates that an open pit could be feasible on the eastern end of the Yaxtche zone and Golden is 
performing an optimization analysis of the potential pit. Following completion of these analyses, Golden plans to examine 
the potential  for bulk underground  mining of the higher  grade  western zone. Golden  may reduce its level of activity in 
advancing the drift until this work has been completed, as the open pit would encompass the area through which the drift 
would advance. Golden has targeted the fourth quarter 2011 for a resource update based on the bulk mining studies. If these 
efforts are successful, Golden plans to proceed with a NI 43-101 compliant Preliminary Economic Assessment in the first 
half of 2012.
Sampling
Through mid-February, 2011, Golden completed 268 diamond drill holes totalling approximately 61,000 meters. Drill cores 
are maintained in a secure facility at the El Quevar campsite before and after splitting. Golden personnel were responsible 
for  logging,  sampling,  splitting,  and  shipping  cores  to  the  laboratory  facilities.  The  insertion  of  standards  and  blanks  is 
carried out at the project site, while the duplicate coarse rejects and pulps are selected by each commercial laboratory. El 
Quevar samples have been analyzed at two independent laboratories. The quality assurance/quality control program used at 
El Quevar includes regular insertion and analysis of blanks and standards to monitor laboratory performance. Blanks are 
used to check for contamination and standards are used to check for grade-dependent biases. Duplicate samples are used to

monitor sample batches for potential sample mix-ups and to monitor the data variability as a function of laboratory error 
and sample homogeneity.
Metallurgical Analysis
Golden has completed metallurgical analyses of composites made from core samples from the central and west portions of 
the El Quevar Project. This test work was focused on determining the response to various types of processing and recovery 
methods, including whole ore cyanidation, sulfide flotation, and a combination of cyanidation of flotation concentrates and 
tailings  leach.  As  drilling  activities  at  El  Quevar  have  continued,  Golden’s  understanding  of  the  potential  orebody  has 
increased. Based on positive test results from recent test work, Golden is developing a plan focused on processing a ratio of 
approximately four to one West Yaxtché material to Central Yaxtché material through a flotation plant in the initial three 
years of operations, and processing a ratio of approximately one to one West Yaxtché material to Central Yaxtché material 
through a combined flotation and cyanide circuit commencing in the fourth year of operations. Tailings from the early years 
of operation from Central Yaxtché would be segregated, and could be reclaimed and processed in the cyanide circuit, which 
would increase silver production from the fourth year of operations.
Environmental Liability and Permitting
Golden  has  obtained  all  necessary  permits  for  its  current  exploration  activities  at  the  El  Quevar  Project.  In  order  to 
construct  the  underground  drift  and  related  workings  as  described  above,  Golden  obtained  a  permit  from  the  Mining 
Secretary  of  the  Salta  Province,  Argentina  in  January  2010.  If  the  El  Quevar  Project  proceeds  to  development  and 
construction,  Golden  will  be  required  to  obtain  numerous  additional  permits  from  national,  provincial  and  municipal 
authorities in Argentina. Golden has selected an environmental contractor, completed the environmental baseline studies, 
and initiated the environmental impact assessment process required to support the permits necessary for construction and 
operations. While Golden is not aware of any significant obstacle to obtaining the required permits, it has not yet formally 
begun to seek the necessary approvals.
Republic of Argentina
The Republic of Argentina is a federal republic located in South America and bordered by Chile, Bolivia, Paraguay, Brazil 
and Uruguay. The federal government coexists with the governments of 23 provinces and one autonomous city, Buenos 
Aires.  Each  province  regulates  its  own  administrative,  legislative  and  judicial  structure,  complying  with  the  republican 
system of government and the division of powers.
Certain Laws Affecting Mining in Argentina
According to Argentine Law, mineral resources are subject to regulation in the provinces where the resources are located. 
Each province has the authority to grant exploration permits and exploitation concession rights to applicants. The Federal 
Congress has enacted the National Mining Code and other substantive mining legislation, which is applicable throughout 
Argentina, however each province has the authority to regulate the procedural aspects of the National Mining Code and to 
organize the enforcement authority within its own territory.
In the province of Salta, where the El Quevar Project is located, all concessions are granted by a judge in the Salta Mining 
Court.  The  types  of  mineral  concessions  relevant  to  the  El  Quevar  Project  are  exploration  concessions  and  exploitation 
concessions. Exploration concessions are granted for up to 1,100 days depending on the size of the concession. The size of 
an exploration concession must be reduced periodically unless the owner applies to the Salta Mining Court to convert it, or 
at least part of it, to an exploitation concession. Exploitation concessions are subject to a yearly payment, which is fixed 
each year by the federal government. For 2010, Golden paid a total of approximately US$36,000 to maintain its El Quevar 
exploitation concessions, and it expects its total payments in 2011 to be approximately US$32,000. An exploration plan 
must be filed for each exploration concession along with an environmental report that must be approved by the provincial 
mining authority. Additional environmental reports are required on a bi-annual basis while the exploration concession is 
valid.  Upon  expiration  of  the  exploration  concession,  all  data  and  documentation  from  the  activities  carried  out  on  the 
concession must be filed with the provincial mining authority.
- 124 -

if you have any questions, or require assistance completing your Proxy.
Exploitation concessions may be granted if any mineral discovery is made either by the concessionaire or authorized third 
parties. An exploitation concession may be maintained indefinitely by timely payment of annual fees, capital investment, 
and continuity of work program (exploration, infrastructure, or mining). In addition to the annual payment of maintenance 
fees, metals mines in the Salta Province are subject to a mine mouth royalty of 3% of metals extracted.
Golden’s  activities  in  Argentina  are  also  subject  to  both  federal  and  provincial  Environmental  Laws  and  regulations. 
Golden currently expects the impact of such Laws and regulations on El Quevar to be minimal. New legislation passed by 
Argentina’s  federal  legislature  intended  to  protect  the  country’s  glaciers  could  potentially  affect  the  mining  industry  in 
Argentina. In order to offset  the effect of the  new legislation,  many provincial legislative bodies, including those in the 
province of Salta, have passed or have indicated that they expect to pass their own glacier-related legislation. Neither the 
federal nor the provincial legislation is currently expected to affect the El Quevar Project.
Taxes in Argentina
Argentina has a federal income tax rate of 35%, and the income tax law allows for a five year carryforward of net operating 
losses.  Argentina  has  several  taxes  in  addition  to  income  tax.  The  more  significant  taxes  under  the  general  tax  system 
include (i) a Value Added Tax (“VAT”) charged at an average rate of 21% for the majority of goods and services provided 
in Argentina, as well as for imports into Argentina, unless specifically exempted, and which is refunded through exports or 
other procedures; (ii) an import duty for goods and services entering the country, unless specifically exempted due to the 
mining investment legislation or free trade agreements; (iii) a provincial gross receipts tax of 1% applied to non-exported 
sales transactions in addition to VAT; (iv) a minimum presumed tax equivalent to 1% of the total asset value of an entity; 
(v) a wealth tax of 0.5% of the equity value of an entity; (vi) a bank tax of 0.6% of each debit and credit transaction and 
(vii) a stamp tax of 1% applied over the gross value of executed agreements. For the metals extraction business, there is a 
5% royalty on the mine mouth value of the mineral extracted for those companies not inscribed under the Argentina Mining 
Investment Law (described below). Also, for exported minerals, Argentina imposes an export tax of 5% for silver doré and 
10% for silver concentrates.
The  tax  laws  applicable  to  exploration,  prospecting,  development,  and  mining  extraction,  as  set  forth  in  the  Argentina 
Mining  Investment  Law,  as  well  as  other  legislation  provide  for  significant  benefits  to  the  general  tax  system  for  those 
companies inscribed under this law and which meet certain conditions. These benefits include: (i) fiscal stability; (ii) double 
deductions  for  certain  exploration  costs;  (iii)  voluntary  accelerated  depreciation;  (iv)  import  duty  exemptions;  (v)  an 
exemption from the minimum presumed tax, the provincial gross receipts tax and the stamp tax described in the previous 
paragraph; (vi) a decrease from 5% to 3% on the royalty on minerals extracted; and (vii) a partial refund of the export tax 
on doré and concentrate. A fiscal stability agreement with the federal government can be obtained with a term of 30 years 
from  the  date  a  project’s  economic  feasibility  is  presented  to  the  government  along  with  the  corresponding  application. 
During the 30 year term, in general, a party to such an agreement with the federal government will not suffer a change in its 
total effective tax rate. New taxes or increases/decreases in tax rates could occur while keeping the effective tax unchanged. 
Assuming  the  El  Quevar  Project’s  economic  feasibility  is  demonstrated,  Golden  expects  to  be  able  to  obtain  a  fiscal 
stability agreement and be eligible for the other benefits described above. However, a fiscal stability agreement does not 
limit changes in VAT, contributions to the social security system, provincial mining royalty, indirect taxes, or partial refund 
of the export tax, and it does not prevent the government from extending rules passed for a specified term or exempt the 
government  from  eliminating  tax  exemptions  that  have  a  scheduled  date  of  expiration.  Also,  for  companies  that  initiate 
production, VAT paid on the import and purchase of goods and services is refunded through exports. On the other hand, for 
companies  that  do  not  initiate  production,  so  long  as  the  company  remains  an  exploration  company,  VAT  paid  on  the 
import and purchase of goods and services used to carry out exploration activities that remain as a credit for greater than 12 
months may be refunded. Argentina also allows for the exemption from import duties when importing capital goods and 
special equipments or components, spare parts of said goods, or leased goods used to carry out  mining and exploration 
activity defined by the Mining Department.
As mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the Argentina Mining Investment Law provides a double deduction on certain 
mining related costs. If Golden begins production at El Quevar, activities such as prospecting, exploration, special studies 
of mineralogy, metallurgy, feasibility and pilot plant studies may be offset 100% against taxable profits, and such costs may 
also  be  depreciated  for  tax  purposes.  In  addition,  Golden  may  benefit  from  tax  depreciation  on  an  accelerated  basis  on 
investments in infrastructure, machinery, equipment and vehicles used in developing production capacity or carrying out 
new mining projects.

Exploration Properties
In addition to El Quevar, Golden owns and controls a portfolio of approximately 16 active exploration properties located 
primarily  in  South  America  and  Mexico.  In  evaluating  whether  an  exploration  project  warrants  potential  future 
development,  Golden  establishes  minimum  requirements  for  reserves  and  annual  saleable  metal  production  rates  and 
estimated  mine  development,  capital  and  operating  cost  requirements.  Golden  seeks  to  generate  value  from  exploration 
properties that do not satisfy its minimum economic requirements through sale or farm-out of the property to a third party, 
and/or through retaining a royalty interest.
Zacatecas (Mexico)
Golden’s  100%  controlled  Zacatecas  silver  and  base  metals  project  in  Mexico  is  in  an  advanced  stage  of  exploration. 
Although Golden believes that the Zacatecas Project may contain significant silver and/or other mineralization, it has not 
completed a feasibility study on the property, and the property may not advance further.
Location and Access
The Zacatecas Project surrounds the municipalities of Zacatecas, Veta Grande, Guadalupe, Pánuco, and Morelos in the state 
of Zacatecas, Mexico. All of  Golden’s Zacatecas properties can be easily reached  within 10 kilometres from the city of 
Zacatecas by paved and dirt roads.
Title and Ownership Rights
Golden owns or controls approximately 190 concessions totalling approximately 15,000 hectares in the Zacatecas Project. 
Of  these  concessions,  all  but  four  are  currently  owned  exclusively  by  Golden,  and  those  four  concessions  are  under 
Golden’s exclusive control under purchase options  with private third-party owners. The purchase options require option 
payments  of  US$375,000  in  2011  and  US$204,000  in  2012.  To  maintain  all  of  the  concessions,  Golden  also  pays 
approximately  US$62,500  per  year  to  the  Mexican  government.  Golden  is  party  to  a  finder’s  fee  agreement  with  an 
individual,  which  requires  that  it  pay  a  1%  net  smelter  return  royalty  on  any  mineral  production  from  certain  of  its 
Zacatecas claims.
Property History
The Zacatecas Mining District is located in the central part of Mexico, in the Faja de Plata mineral belt. Production from the 
Zacatecas  district  is  estimated  by  the  Mexican  Federal  Mining  Agency  to  exceed  750  million  ounces  of  silver.  The 
existence  of  mining  operations  or  mineral  deposits  on  adjacent  properties  is  not  indicative  of  whether  mineral  deposits 
occur on Golden’s properties.
Exploration Activities
From  1994  to  2005,  Golden  performed  sporadic  reconnaissance  work  on  some  of  the  Zacatecas  concessions,  including 
taking approximately 2,000 surface samples. In 2006, Golden began systematic reconnaissance work on all concessions that 
it controlled. On the basis of this and its previous work in the Zacatecas region, Golden identified the Pánuco, Muleros, El 
Cristo, San Manuel-San Gil, San Pedro de Hercules, and Adriana areas of interest. In these areas, Golden performed more 
detailed mapping work, as well as trenching and detailed sampling, and in the Muleros area, Golden completed a two-stage 
diamond drilling program of holes totalling approximately 6,800 meters. Golden has also completed a first stage drilling 
program  and  is  currently  conducting  a  second  stage  drilling  program  at  the  Pánuco  target,  which  is  located  in  the 
northeastern part of the Zacatecas district about 10 kilometres east of the Muleros area, and at the San Pedro de Hercules 
and El Cristo targets, located in the southern and central part of the district. Golden believes that each of the target areas has 
potential for the discovery of silver with associated base metals and gold. Golden has spent approximately US$11.1 million 
through December 31, 2010 on exploration and property acquisition in the Zacatecas district.

Geology and Mineralization
At a regional level, the  Zacatecas Mining District is located  within the physiographical  provinces of the Western Sierra 
Madre and the Central Plateau.
The  basement  rock  units  in  the  area  include  the  metamorphic  rocks  of  the  Zacatecas  Formation  of  Upper  Triassic  age. 
Overlying  these  rocks  are  the  volcano-sedimentary  units  of  the  Chilitos  Formation  of  Upper  Jurassic-Lower  Cretaceous 
age. During the Tertiary period, a polymictic conglomerate known as the “Red Zacatecas Conglomerate” was discordantly 
deposited, and overlying this, andesitic to rhyolitic flows and tuffs were deposited. All units are intruded by small stocks 
and plugs of rhyolitic to andesitic composition. The Zacatecas Formation is composed of a sequence of sericitized phyllites 
and metamorphosed shales, sandstones, conglomerates and limestones. These rocks are host to some veins such as those of 
the El Bote vein system and the deeper portions of the Mala Noche vein system.
The Chilitos Formation of Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous age is a volcano-sedimentary sequence made up of massive 
and pillowed lavas of basalticandesitic composition with intercalations of sedimentary, volcaniclastic and calcareous rocks, 
metamorphosed to greenschist facies. This sequence is locally thrust over the Zacatecas Formation and is the main host 
rock for mineral systems in several mining districts in the region, including Zacatecas and Fresnillo.
During the Oligocene-Miocene period, extensive deformation occurred that produced normal faulting, forming grabens and 
horsts  bearing  generally  north-northeast/south-southwest.  It  was  during  this  phase  of  deformation  that  most  of  the 
epigenetic mineral deposits were formed.
In  the  six  target  areas  identified  by  Golden,  rocks  of  the  Chilitos  Formation  are  host  to  the  veins.  The  six  main  target 
areas—Muleros,  Pánuco,  El  Cristo,  San  Manuel-San  Gil,  San  Pedro  de  Hercules,  and  Adriana—are  described  in  more 
detail below.
Muleros Area
Located in the northern part of the Zacatecas Mining District, the Muleros area covers an area of roughly 1,800 meters by 
2,400  meters,  where  four  subparallel  epithermal  vein-faults  outcrop.  The  veins  are  composed  of  quartz  and  calcite,  and 
contain silver mineralization associated with minor antimony and lead and zinc. The main vein system bears N40° to 70°W 
and dips 60° to 85° mainly to the southwest, with thicknesses that vary from 0.1 meters to 6.2 meters, and lengths from 
1,000 to 2,500 meters, with shorter offshoots. The total length of all the outcropping veins is about 6,500 meters, and the 
total length of the inferred veins (i.e., those that do not continuously outcrop) is 2,100 meters, with an average width of 1.33 
meters. From 2006 to the present, Golden has taken approximately 1,100 surface samples from outcrops and trenches.
At  Muleros,  Golden  has  drilled  37  diamond  drill  holes  totalling  approximately  6,800  meters.  There  were  two  stages  of 
drilling. The first program was carried out with a total of 3,840 meters distributed over 31 short bore holes. The purpose of 
this program was to determine the structural behaviour of the veins, the vein textures and the geochemistry at a vertical 
depth of about 100 meters from the surface. The second program was carried out with a total of 2,976 meters distributed 
over six boreholes. These holes were deeper tests (over 300 meters in depth), meant to intersect the veins in a postulated 
zone of high grade mineralization. The results indicate that the dip of the veins changed, becoming less steep than indicated 
at the surface and the intersections were less deep than planned (meaning they may have intercepted the upper part of a 
possible  zone).  Results  from  this  drilling  returned  narrow  intercepts  of  silver  mineralization.  Golden’s  results  to  date 
indicate that the more promising part of the Muleros target may be in the southeastern part of the area.
Pánuco Area
The Pánuco target area is located in the northeastern part of the Zacatecas district about 10 kilometres east of the Muleros 
area and is comprised of two main veins hosted in sedimentary rocks that outcrop for an aggregate of about 5 kilometres in 
a northwesterly direction. Vein widths range from one to three meters. Several small pits indicate mining of silver from 
oxidized surface rocks during Colonial times. There has been no modern exploration at Pánuco. Golden has mapped the 
area in detail and collected approximately 400 samples from the veins and wall rocks. Golden is currently conducting a 
second phase drill program consisting of 18 to 20 diamond core holes totalling about 4,000 meters at an estimated cost of

approximately US$700,000. If the results from this work appear promising, Golden intends to conduct additional drilling 
and analytical work to advance the project in 2011.
El Cristo Area
Located in the central portion of the Zacatecas Mining District, the El Cristo area covers a surface area of 800 meters by 
2,000 meters, where five subparallel epithermal quartz-calcite veins outcrop. These veins correspond to the northwestern 
extension of the Vetagrande vein system. From 2006 to October 2008, Golden took approximately 1,000 surface samples 
from outcrops and trenches, of which 516 are from the veins. These samples have returned silver and gold values, with 
anomalous values in copper, lead and zinc. The average vein width is 1.5 meters. The main vein system bears N50 to 60° W 
and dips 60 to 80° SW, with thicknesses varying from 0.15 meters to 5.0 meters, and lengths from 500 to 2,400 meters, 
with  shorter  offshoots.  The  total  length  of  the  outcropping  veins  and  their  respective  offshoots  is  approximately  8,000 
meters.
The area has been mapped at a 1:2,500 scale and Golden completed an environmental impact report in June 2007. Golden 
completed  an  exploration  program  during  2010  including  2,850  meters  in  eight  drill  holes  within  a  1.6  kilometre  long 
portion of the vein zone at an estimated cost of approximately US$500,000.
Golden’s drilling intercepted several veins in the zone and returned values in lead and zinc in the 1% to 5% combined range 
over widths of one to three meters.  Values of silver and gold were uniformly low.
San Manuel-San Gil Area
Located in the central portion of the Zacatecas Mining District, the San Manuel-San Gil area covers an area of 8 square 
kilometres, where sub-parallel epithermal veins and alteration zones outcrop. The main vein system bears N60W to East-
West and dips to the north and south, with thicknesses varying from 0.10 meters to 7 meters, and lengths from 400 to 1,400 
meters with shorter offshoots. The total length of all the outcropping veins and their respective offshoots is about 7,000 
meters, with an average width of 1.2 meters. Golden has taken 167 chip-channel samples that have returned silver and gold 
values, and highly anomalous values in copper, lead and zinc.
Golden previously carried out a geochemical soil sampling program in an area measuring 4.2 kilometres by 2 kilometres 
with  east-west  lines  every  100  meters  and  samples  every  50  meters.  A  total  of  785  samples  were  taken.  The  strongest 
anomaly in silver, gold and copper is located in the southeastern portion of the area.
Golden  has  planned  an  exploration  program  including  approximately  2,000  meters  of  drilling  at  an  estimated  cost  of 
US$350,000 to test this target.
San Pedro de Hercules
Located in the southern part of the district, the San Pedro de Hercules target consists of a series of west-trending quartz 
veins and stockwork zones cutting Tertiary volcanic rocks. Surface sampling has returned encouraging values in silver, lead 
and zinc, with several samples containing more than 200 grams per tonne silver. The area is located to the north of the 
Cozamin Mine of Capstone Mining and exhibits several of the characteristics of the upper portions of the Mala Noche vein 
system, host to Capstone’s orebody.
During  2010,  Golden  completed  a  drill  program  consisting  of  nine  holes  totalling  3,173  meters  at  the  San  Pedro  de 
Hercules target. Golden intercepted interesting mineralization in several holes, including 1.15 meters averaging 2.5 grams 
per tonne gold, 240 grams per tonne silver, 0.59% lead and 2.53% zinc in hole SJ-10-02 and 2.05 meters averaging 602 
grams per tonne silver, 0.62% lead and 1.87% zinc in hole SJ-10-03. Golden thinks this can be compared favourably with 
the upper zone at the nearby Cozamin mine and the potential for higher copper grade at depth may be good. Golden plans to 
drill several holes in 2011 to test the deeper parts of the vein system at a cost of about US$350,000.

Adriana
Golden has recently identified a prospective copper-silver target in the southern part of the Zacatecas district that it plans to 
test by drilling in 2011. The Adriana area is located to the west of Capstone Mining’s Cozamin mining property, where they 
recently announced the discovery of significant copper-silver mineralization in the footwall of the Mala Noche vein, the 
principal host of the mineralization in the Cozamin mine. Golden’s claims abut the Capstone claims immediately to the 
west of their property. Golden has determined that both the Mala Noche structure and the footwall structure extend onto its 
property. Golden’s mapping and sampling has traced these structures for more than one kilometre to the west and northwest 
and Golden has obtained copper, zinc and silver values from sampling that appear to be consistent with the upper part of the 
Mala Noche vein. Capstone has drilled exploration holes within 50 meters of Golden’s common property boundary. Golden 
is planning an initial drill program of five holes totalling 2,100 meters at a cost of about US$350,000 early in 2011. If its 
results are promising, Golden plans to conduct additional drilling.
Other Exploration Properties
Golden believes that the properties described below, while not as advanced as El Quevar and Zacatecas, appear promising 
based on Golden’s activities to date. Golden intends to conduct further mapping, sampling and drilling on these properties. 
Although Golden believes that these properties merit further exploration activities, its activities are at a preliminary stage 
and it does not yet consider any one of these properties to be individually material.
Matehuapil (Mexico)
The  Matehuapil  Project  is  located  in  northeastern  Zacatecas  state  in  central  Mexico.  Significant  projects  in  the  region 
surrounding Matehuapil include the Peñasquito Mine, the Concepcíon del Oro district and the new Camino Rojo discovery. 
The  project  currently  includes  two  concessions  totalling  approximately  12,000  hectares,  and  Golden  has  a  joint  venture 
agreement  with  Almaden  Minerals  Ltd.  under  which  it  may  earn  a  60%  interest  in  the  properties  by  making  certain 
payments to Almaden and conducting work programs over a six year period. Golden has applied for additional property in 
the area that will be owned solely by Golden.
The geology at Matehuapil is comprised of limestones with some sandstones and shales intruded by mozonitic bodies and 
cut by faults and veins related to regional structures. The project has potential for the discovery of silver and base metal-
rich  veins  and  replacement  deposits,  including  carbonate  replacement  deposits  similar  to  the  famous  Santa  Eulalia  and 
Naica deposits found further north.
In addition to these types of deposits, Golden has indentified an area of altered intrusive and sedimentary rocks that contain 
potentially  significant amounts of  gold. This area, called Rabioso, is located in the  northwest portion of the Matehuapil 
concession and contains an exposure of oxidized altered intrusive rock cut by numerous fractures and veinlets. Sampling of 
this area has indicated that gold values are present over an exposed area of the intrusive of approximately 250 meters by 
800 meters and are also found in the adjacent altered sedimentary rocks to a lesser degree. Golden’s work has included 
trenching and the excavation of pits to obtain material for analysis and the compilation of detailed geological information. 
This work has indicated that the possibility of a large disseminated gold deposit exists at the Rabioso target.
Golden completed an initial drill test of 11 holes totalling approximately 3,000 meters at a cost of about US$500,000 in the 
third quarter of 2010. Golden’s results were mixed, with few intervals of more than one meter returning greater than 1.0 g/t 
gold.  Golden  is  reviewing  its  results  and  the  other  target  areas  on  the  project  before  reaching  a  decision  regarding  the 
project.
La Pinta (Mexico)
The  La  Pinta  property  is  located  in  northeastern  Zacatecas  state  in  central  Mexico  about  25  kilometres  southwest  of 
Concepcíon del Oro and 13 kilometres south of Goldcorp’s Peñasquito mine. The project includes 10 concessions totalling 
35,300 hectares that are owned outright by Golden and one 40 hectare concession controlled under an option to purchase a 
100% interest that requires that Golden pay a total of US$35,000 over a two year period ending in September 2011.

The geology at La Pinta is largely obscured by alluvium, but mapping of available outcrops reveals a thrust fault that places
the Cretaceous age Indidura Formation over the Cuesta de Cura Formation, also of Cretaceous age. This contact is marked 
by  boulders  and  fragments  of  limestone  that  are  in  a  siliceous  matrix  and  fragments  of  silicified  intrusive  that  locally 
contains abundant pyrite. Large fragments of the altered intrusive are found as float over an area of approximately 2,000 
meters  by  500  meters.  Sampling  of  this  material  has  returned  gold  values  and  highly  anomalous  levels  of  arsenic. 
Elsewhere  on  the  property,  scattered  outcrops  of  the  Caracol  Formation  indicates  areas  of  brecciation  and  pyritic 
mineralization that has returned silver values and anomalous levels of arsenic and zinc. Outcrops of the various sedimentary 
units of Cretaceous age show additional evidence of potential mineralization, including calcite and quartz veining, pyrite 
and iron oxides after pyrite.
Golden has completed a detailed ground magnetic survey over the central area of interest. This survey indicates a low-level 
anomaly that is in part coincident with the area of intrusive float and Golden interprets this as indicating that an altered 
intrusive rock may be present under the alluvium or intruding the sedimentary rocks in this area.
Golden completed an initial drill test of 10 holes totalling approximately 2,500 meters at a cost of about US$400,000 in the 
third quarter of 2010. It did not encounter the targeted intrusive rocks in this program. Golden believes that the potential for 
discovery remains. It plans to conduct an additional geophysical survey before undertaking more drilling.
Reconnaissance Properties
In addition to its exploration properties, Golden has approximately 50 reconnaissance properties. Reconnaissance properties 
are  those  properties  on  which  Golden  is  conducting  preliminary  sampling  and  geological  analysis  to  determine  the  best 
potential areas for more detailed exploration.
Farm-outs, Royalties and Other Dispositions
Exploration properties that Golden decides not to advance are evaluated for joint venture, sale of all or a partial interest, and 
royalty potential. In evaluating whether an exploration project warrants future expenditure, Golden establishes minimum 
requirements for reserves and annual saleable metal production rates and estimate mine development, capital and operating 
cost requirements to determine if developing the project is economically viable. Exploration properties that do not satisfy 
the  minimum  economic  requirements  may  generate  value  through  sale  or  farm-out  to  third  parties,  or  through  retaining 
royalty interests. Golden has minority ownership interests and/or royalties in the following properties that were once part of 
Golden’s exploration portfolio:

Platosa  Royalty  (Mexico).  During  2004,  Golden  sold  to  Excellon  the  mineral  rights  to  a  portion  of  Golden’s 
Platosa silver-lead-zinc property in Mexico, and retained a 3% net smelter return royalty interest. In November 
2009,  Golden  sold  its  49%  joint  venture  interest  in  the  Platosa  project  to  Excellon.  Golden  received  a  cash 
payment of US$2.0 million and retained a 1% net smelter return royalty over the joint venture properties.
Zacatecas Royalty (Mexico). In August 2009, Golden sold to a subsidiary of Capstone Mining Corp. the mineral 
rights  to  a  portion  of  its  Zacatecas  Project  in  Mexico;  namely,  the  Esperanza,  San  Francisco,  and  Santa  Rita 
concessions immediately adjacent to Capstone’s Cozamin Mine. The purchase price Golden received for the three 
concessions included (a) an initial payment of US$1.0 million, (b) future cash payments of a net smelter return of 
1.5% on the first one million tonnes of production from the acquired claims, and (c) cash payments equivalent to a 
3.0% net smelter return on production in excess of one million tonnes from the acquired claims. Additionally, the 
net smelter return on production in excess of one million tonnes escalates by 0.5% for each US$0.50 increment in 
copper price above US$3.00 per pound of copper. There is currently no production on these concessions.
Paca Pulacayo (Bolivia). In January 2011, Golden closed a purchase and sale agreement with Apogee Minerals 
Limited (“Apogee”) whereby it sold to Apogee all of the issued and outstanding shares of a Bolivian subsidiary 
which holds a 100% interest in the Paca Pulacayo property in Bolivia. Pursuant to the agreement, Apogee issued to 
Golden 5,000,000 of its common shares. Eighteen months following the closing of the transaction, Apogee will 
issue  to  Golden  an  additional  3,000,000  of  its  common  shares  and  pay  Golden  a  cash  fee  in  the  amount  of 
US$500,000.

Metals Market Overview
Golden  has  targeted  exploration  properties  that  potentially  contain  silver  or  other  precious  metals,  including  gold. 
Descriptions of the markets for these metals are provided below.
Silver Market
Silver has traditionally served as a medium of exchange, much like gold. Silver’s strength, malleability, ductility, thermal 
and electrical conductivity, sensitivity to light and ability to endure extreme changes in temperature combine to make it a 
widely used industrial metal. While silver continues to be used as a form of investment and a financial asset, the principal 
uses of silver are industrial, primarily in electrical and electronic components, photography, jewellery, silverware, batteries, 
computer chips, electrical contacts, and high technology printing. Silver’s anti-bacterial properties also make it valuable for 
use in medicine and in water purification. Additionally, new uses of silver are being developed in connection with the use 
of superconductive wire and radio frequency identification devices.
Most silver production is obtained from mining operations in which silver is not the principal or primary product. The CPM 
Group, a precious  metal and  commodities consultant, estimates in its Yearbook 2010 that approximately 70% of  mined 
silver is produced as a by-product of mining lead, zinc, gold or copper deposits.
The following table sets forth for the periods indicated on the London Fix high and low silver fixes in U.S. dollars per troy 
ounce. On July 28, 2011, the closing price of silver was US$40.19 per troy ounce.

Golden currently has approximately 205 employees, including 12 working out of the Golden office in Golden, Colorado, 
approximately  65  working  out  of  Golden’s  various  foreign  exploration  offices,  and  approximately  130  working  in 
Argentina in connection with the El Quevar Project.
Competition
As an exploration stage company, Golden competes with other mineral resource exploration and development companies 
for financing and for the acquisition of new mineral properties. In addition, Golden competes with other mining companies 
to attract and retain key executives, skilled labour, contractors and other employees. The metals markets are cyclical and 
Golden’s ability to maintain its competitive position over the long term will be based on its ability to acquire and develop 
quality deposits, hire and retain a skilled workforce and to manage its costs.
Many of the mineral resource exploration and development companies with which Golden competes have greater financial 
and  technical  resources  than  Golden  does.  Accordingly,  these  competitors  may  be  able  to  spend  greater  amounts  on 
acquisitions of mineral properties of merit, on exploration of their mineral properties and on development of their mineral 
properties. In addition, they may be able to afford greater geological expertise in the targeting and exploration of mineral 
properties.  This  competition  could  result  in  competitors  having  mineral  properties  of  greater  quality  and  interest  to 
prospective investors who may finance additional exploration and development. This competition could adversely impact

Golden’s ability to finance  further exploration and to achieve the  financing  necessary for Golden to develop its  mineral 
properties.
Risk Factors Related to Golden
Investors  in  Golden  should  consider  carefully,  in  addition  to  the  other  information  contained  in,  or  incorporated  by 
reference into, this Circular, the following risk factors:
Risks related to Golden’s Business
Golden expects to incur operating losses at least through 2011 and its profitability in the foreseeable future depends 
entirely  on  the  success  of  the  El  Quevar  Project,  which  has  not  been  shown  to  contain  proven  or  probable  mineral 
reserves.
Golden  has  a  history  of  losses  and  expects  that  it  will  continue  to  incur  operating  losses  unless  and  until  such  time  as 
Golden’s El Quevar Project in Argentina or another one of its exploration properties enters into commercial production and 
generates sufficient revenue to fund continuing operations. Golden is focused primarily on the advancement of El Quevar.
Neither the El Quevar Project, nor any of Golden’s other properties, has been shown to contain proven or probable mineral 
reserves and expenditures made in the exploration of Golden’s properties may not result in discoveries of commercially 
recoverable quantities of ore. Most exploration projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable deposits of 
ore and Golden cannot assure you that any mineral deposit Golden identifies will qualify as an ore body that can be legally 
and economically exploited or that any particular level of recovery of silver from discovered mineralization will in fact be 
realized.
The MICON Golden Technical Report on the Yaxtché deposit of Golden’s El Quevar property indicates the presence of 
“mineralized material.”  Mineralized material figures based on estimates made by geologists are inherently imprecise and 
depend  on  geological  interpretation  and  statistical  inferences  drawn  from  drilling  and  sampling  that  may  prove  to  be 
unreliable or inaccurate. Golden cannot provide assurance that these estimates will be accurate or that proven and probable 
mineral  reserves  will  be  identified  at  El  Quevar  or  any  of  Golden’s  other  properties.  Even  if  Golden  establishes  the 
presence of reserves at a project, the economic viability of the project may not justify exploitation. Golden plans to spend 
significant  amounts  on  the  advancement  of  El  Quevar  prior  to  establishing  the  economic  viability  of  the  project  in  a 
technical report compliant with NI 43-101.
Estimates  of  reserves,  mineral  deposits  and  production  costs  can  also  be  affected  by  such  factors  as  governmental 
regulations  and  requirements,  fluctuations  in  metals  prices  or  costs  of  essential  materials  or  supplies,  weather, 
environmental  factors,  unforeseen  technical  difficulties,  unusual  or  unexpected  geological  formations  and  work 
interruptions. In addition, the grade of ore ultimately mined may differ from that indicated by drilling results, sampling, 
feasibility studies or technical reports. Short-term factors relating to reserves, such as the need for orderly development of 
ore bodies or the processing of new or different grades, may also have an adverse effect on mining operations and on the 
results of operations. Silver or other minerals recovered in small scale laboratory tests may not be duplicated in large scale 
tests under on-site production conditions.
Golden  has  no  current  source  of  revenues  and  will  continue  to  require  substantial  external  financing  to  pay  for  its 
operating and general and administrative expenses, continue the advancement of the El Quevar Project and fund its 
exploration activities.
From  Golden’s  incorporation  in  March  2009  through  June  30,  2010,  Golden’s  revenues  consisted  primarily  of  the 
management fees paid to Golden under a management services agreement with Sumitomo under which Golden managed 
the San Cristóbal mine in Bolivia for Sumitomo. The management services agreement was terminated at the end of June 
2010. Golden does not currently anticipate that it will seek or obtain other mine management services agreements in the 
future, and thus does not expect to receive future revenue from the performance of mine management services.
Unless and until  Golden commences production at  the El  Quevar Project or acquires a producing  mine, Golden  will be 
required  to  continue  to  raise  funds  from  external  sources  in  order  to  pay  its  operating  and  general  and  administrative

if you have any questions, or require assistance completing your Proxy.
expenses, advance the El Quevar Project, maintain its exploration properties and continue its exploration activities. If the El 
Quevar Project proceeds to development and construction, Golden anticipates that it would need to raise additional capital 
during 2011 or 2012. The size and capital cost for a possible mine and processing facilities at El Quevar have not been 
determined and would depend, among other things, on the results of Golden’s ongoing drilling programs to further define 
the extent of the Yaxtché deposit. If the deposit is larger than Golden originally anticipated, Golden expects that the mine 
and  related  facilities  would  be  larger  than  originally  anticipated  with  resulting  increases  in  capital  and  other  costs.  The 
actual amount required would be based on the final results of the proposed feasibility study. Golden does not have a credit 
agreement in place and believes that securing credit for the development and construction of the El Quevar Project may be 
difficult given Golden’s limited history and continuing volatility in global credit markets. Golden cannot provide assurance 
that it will be able to obtain the necessary financing for the El Quevar Project on favourable terms or at all. Failure to obtain 
sufficient  financing  may  also  result  in  the  delay  or  indefinite  postponement  of  exploration  activities  at  Golden’s  other 
properties.
Golden depends on the services of key executives.
Golden’s business strategy is based on leveraging the experience and skill of its management team. Golden is dependent on 
the  services  of  key  executives,  including  Jeffrey  Clevenger,  Jerry  Danni,  Robert  Blakestad  and  Robert  Vogels.  Due  to 
Golden’s relatively small size, the loss of any of these persons or Golden’s inability to attract and retain additional highly 
skilled employees may have a material adverse effect on Golden’s business and its ability to manage and succeed in its 
exploration activities.
The exploration of mineral properties is highly speculative in nature, involves substantial expenditures and is frequently 
non-productive.
Golden’s future growth and profitability will depend, in large part, on its ability to identify and acquire additional mineral 
rights, and on the costs and results of its continued exploration programs. Competition for attractive mineral exploration 
properties  is  intense.  Golden’s  strategy  is  to  seek  to  identify  reserves  through  a  broad  program  of  exploration.  Mineral 
exploration is highly speculative in nature and is frequently non-productive. Substantial expenditures are required to:
•
•
•
•
establish mineral reserves through drilling and metallurgical and other testing techniques; 
determine metal content and metallurgical recovery processes to extract metal from the ore;
determine the feasibility of mine development and production; and
construct, renovate or expand mining and processing facilities.
If Golden discovers ore, it usually takes several years from the initial phases of exploration until production is possible. 
During this time, the economic feasibility of a project may change because of increased costs, lower metal prices or other 
factors. As a result of these uncertainties, Golden may not successfully acquire additional mineral rights, or its exploration 
programs  may  not  result  in  proven  and  probable  reserves  at  all  or  in  sufficient  quantities  to  justify  developing  any  of 
Golden’s exploration properties.
The decisions about future development of projects will be based primarily on feasibility studies, which derive estimates of 
reserves, operating costs and project economic returns. Estimates of economic returns are based, in part, on assumptions 
about future metal prices and estimates of average cash operating costs based upon, among other things:
•
•
•
•
anticipated tonnage, grades and metallurgical characteristics of ore to be mined and processed;
anticipated recovery rates of silver and other metals from the ore;
cash operating costs of comparable facilities and equipment; and
anticipated climatic conditions.
Actual cash operating costs, production and economic returns may differ significantly from those anticipated by Golden’s 
studies and estimates.

if you have any questions, or require assistance completing your Proxy.
Golden’s  long-term cash flow and profitability will be affected by changes in the prices of silver and other metals.
Golden’s ability to establish reserves and develop any of Golden’s exploration properties—and Golden’s profitability and 
long-term  viability—depend,  in  large  part,  on  the  market  price  of  silver,  zinc,  lead,  gold,  copper  and  other  metals.  The 
market prices for these metals are volatile and are affected by numerous factors beyond Golden’s control, including:
•
•
•
•
•
global or regional consumption patterns;
supply of, and demand for, silver, zinc, lead, gold, copper and other metals;
speculative activities and producer hedging activities;
expectations for inflation; and
political and economic conditions.
Future  weakness in  the  global economy could increase  volatility in  metals prices or depress prices,  which could in turn 
make  it  uneconomical  for  Golden  to  continue  its  exploration  activities.  Volatility  or  sustained  price  declines  may  also 
adversely affect Golden’s ability to build its business.
If Golden is unable to obtain all of its required governmental permits or property rights, Golden’s operations could be 
negatively impacted.
Golden’s future operations, including exploration and any potential development activities, will require additional permits 
from various governmental authorities. Golden’s operations are and will continue to be governed by Laws and regulations 
governing  prospecting,  development,  mining,  production,  exports,  taxes,  labour  standards,  occupational  health,  waste 
disposal, toxic substances, land use, environmental protection, mine safety, mining royalties and other matters. Golden may 
also be required to obtain certain property rights to access or use its properties. Obtaining or renewing licenses and permits, 
and acquiring property rights, can be complex and time-consuming processes. Golden cannot assure that it will be able to 
acquire all required licenses, permits or property rights on reasonable terms or in a timely manner, or at all, that such terms 
will not be adversely changed, that required extensions will be granted, or that the issuance of such licenses, permits or 
property rights will not be challenged by third parties. Delays in obtaining or a failure to obtain any licenses, permits or 
property  rights  or  any  required  extensions,  challenges  to  the  issuance  of  Golden’s  licenses,  permits  or  property  rights, 
whether successful or unsuccessful, changes to the terms of Golden’s licenses, permits or property rights, or a failure to 
comply  with the terms of any such licenses, permits or property rights that  Golden  has obtained, could  have a  material 
adverse effect on Golden’s business by delaying or preventing or making continued operations economically unfeasible. 
U.S.  or  international  legislative  or  regulatory  action  to  address  concerns  about  climate  change  and  greenhouse  gas 
emissions could also negatively impact Golden’s operations. While Golden will continue to monitor and assess any new 
policies, legislation or regulations regarding such matters, Golden currently believes that the impact of such legislation on 
its business will not be significant.
Lack of infrastructure could forestall or prevent further exploration and development.
Exploration activities, as  well as any development activities, depend on adequate infrastructure. Reliable roads, bridges, 
power  sources  and  water  supply  are  important  factors  that  affect  capital  and  operating  costs  and  the  feasibility  and 
economic  viability  of  a  project,  or  unanticipated  or  higher  than  expected  costs  and  unusual  or  infrequent  weather 
phenomena,  or  government  or  other  interference  in  the  maintenance  or  provision  of  such  infrastructure  could  adversely 
affect Golden’s operations, financial condition and results of operations.
Golden’s exploration activities are in countries with developing economies and are subject to the risks of political and 
economic instability associated with these countries.
Golden  currently  conducts  exploration  activities  almost  exclusively  in  Latin  American  countries  with  developing 
economies,  including  Argentina,  Mexico  and  Peru.  These  countries  and  other  emerging  markets  in  which  Golden  may 
conduct  operations  have  from  time  to  time  experienced  economic  or  political  instability.  Golden  may  be  materially 
adversely  affected  by  risks  associated  with  conducting  exploration  activities  in  countries  with  developing  economies, 
including:

political instability and violence;
war and civil disturbance;
acts of terrorism or other criminal activity;
expropriation or nationalization;
changing fiscal, royalty and tax regimes;
fluctuations in currency exchange rates;
high rates of inflation;
uncertain or changing legal requirements respecting the ownership and maintenance of mineral properties, mines 
and mining operations, and inconsistent or arbitrary application of such legal requirements;
underdeveloped industrial and economic infrastructure;
corruption; and
unenforceability of contractual rights.
Changes  in  mining  or  investment  policies  or  shifts  in  the  prevailing  political  climate  in  any  of  the  countries  in  which 
Golden conducts exploration activities could adversely affect its business.
Title to Golden’s mineral properties may be challenged.
Golden’s policy is to seek to confirm the validity of its rights to, title to, or contract rights with respect to, each mineral 
property in which Golden has a material interest. However, Golden cannot guarantee that title to its properties will not be 
challenged.  Title  insurance  generally  is  not  available  for  mineral  properties,  and  Golden’s  ability  to  ensure  that  it  has 
obtained secure rights to individual mineral properties or mining concessions may be severely constrained. Golden has not 
conducted surveys of all of the exploration properties in which it holds direct or indirect interests and, therefore, the precise 
area and location of these exploration properties may be in doubt. Accordingly, Golden’s mineral properties may be subject 
to prior unregistered agreements, transfers or claims, and title may be affected by, among other things, undetected defects. 
In addition, Golden may be unable to operate its properties as permitted or to enforce its rights with respect to its properties, 
and the title to Golden’s mineral properties may also be impacted by state action.
In  some  of  the  countries  in  which  Golden  operates,  failure  to  comply  with  applicable  Laws  and  regulations  relating  to 
mineral right applications and tenure could result in loss, reduction or expropriation of entitlements, or the imposition of 
additional local or foreign parties as joint venture partners. Any such loss, reduction or imposition of partners could have a 
material adverse affect in Golden’s financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Golden may lose rights to properties if it fails to meet payment requirements or development or production schedules.
Golden derives the rights to some of its mineral properties from leaseholds or purchase option agreements that require the 
payment of option payments, rent or other instalment fees or specified expenditures. For example, Golden acquired certain 
of  its  rights  on  the  El  Quevar  property  through  option  agreements,  which  require  aggregate  payments  of  approximately 
US$2.2 million over the next two years. The El Quevar property is Golden’s most advanced exploration property, and the 
only property on which Golden has estimated mineralized material. If Golden fails to make these payments when they are 
due, its rights to the property may terminate.
Some  contracts  with  respect  to  Golden’s  mineral  properties  require  development  or  production  schedules.  If  Golden  is 
unable to meet any or all of the development or production schedules, it could lose all or a portion of its interests in such 
properties. Moreover, Golden is required in certain instances to  make payments to governments  in order to maintain  its 
rights to its mineral properties. Because Golden’s ability to make some of these payments is likely to depend on its ability 
to obtain external financing, Golden may not have the funds to make these payments by the required dates.
Even if Golden is successful in bringing the El Quevar Project into production, mining operations are hazardous, raise 
environmental concerns and raise insurance risks.
Mining operations are by their nature subject to a variety of risks, such as cave-ins, pit-wall failures, flooding, rock bursts, 
fire,  industrial  accidents,  failure  of  processing  and  mining  equipment,  environmental  hazards,  discharge  of  pollutants  or 
hazardous  chemicals,  supply  problems  and  delays,  changes  in  the  regulatory  environment,  encountering  unusual  or 
unexpected  geological  formations  or  other  geological  or  grade  problems,  encountering  unanticipated  ground  or  water

if you have any questions, or require assistance completing your Proxy.
conditions, periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions, and other acts of God or unfavourable 
operating conditions. These risks could result in delays to development or production, damage to or destruction of mineral 
properties or processing facilities, personal injury or death, loss of key employees, environmental damage, monetary losses 
and  possible  legal  liability.  Satisfying  these  liabilities  may  be  very  costly  and  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on 
Golden’s future cash flow, results of operations and financial condition. Golden may not be able to insure fully or at all 
against these risks, or Golden may decide not to take out insurance against such risks as a result of high premiums or for 
other reasons.
Golden’s  activities  are  subject  to  foreign  Environmental  Laws  and  regulations  that  may  materially  adversely  affect 
Golden’s future operations.
Golden conducts mineral exploration activities primarily in Argentina, Mexico and Peru. These countries have Laws and 
regulations that control the exploration and mining of mineral properties and their effects on the environment, including air 
and water quality, mine reclamation, waste handling and disposal, the protection of different species of flora and fauna and 
the preservation of lands. These Laws and regulations will require Golden to acquire permits and other authorizations for 
certain activities. In many countries, there is relatively new comprehensive environmental legislation, and the permitting 
and authorization process may not be established or predictable. Golden may not be able to acquire necessary permits or 
authorizations  on  a  timely  basis,  if  at  all.  Delays  in  acquiring  any  permit  or  authorization  could  increase  the  cost  of 
Golden’s projects and could delay the commencement of production.
Environmental  legislation  in  many  countries  is  evolving  in  a  manner  that  will  likely  require  stricter  standards  and 
enforcement,  increased  fines  and  penalties  for  non-compliance,  more  stringent  environmental  assessments  of  proposed 
projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees. Golden cannot 
predict  what  environmental  legislation  or  regulations  will  be  enacted  or  adopted  in  the  future  or  how  future  Laws  and 
regulations will be administered or interpreted. For example, in September 2010, the Argentine National Congress passed 
legislation which prohibits mining activity in glacial and surrounding areas. Although Golden does not currently anticipate 
that this legislation will impact the El Quevar Project, the legislation provides an example of the evolving environmental 
legislation  in  the  areas  in  which  Golden  operates.  Compliance  with  more  stringent  Laws  and  regulations,  as  well  as 
potentially more vigorous enforcement policies or regulatory agencies or stricter interpretation of existing Laws, may (i) 
necessitate significant capital outlays, (ii) cause Golden to delay, terminate or otherwise change its intended activities with 
respect to one or more projects, or (iii) materially adversely affect Golden’s future exploration activities.
Many  of  Golden’s  exploration  properties  are  located  in  historic  mining  districts  where  prior  owners  may  have  caused 
environmental  damage  that  may  not  be  known  to  Golden  or  to  the  regulators.  In  most  cases,  Golden  has  not  sought 
complete  environmental  analyses  of  its  mineral  properties  and  has  not  conducted  comprehensive  reviews  of  the 
environmental  Laws  and  regulations  in  every  jurisdiction  in  which  Golden  owns  or  controls  mineral  properties.  To  the 
extent Golden is subject to environmental requirements or liabilities, the cost of compliance with these requirements and 
satisfaction of these liabilities could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. If 
Golden is unable to fully fund the cost of remediation of any environmental condition, Golden may be required to suspend 
activities or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remediation.
Golden competes against larger and more experienced companies.
The mining industry is intensely competitive. Many large mining companies are primarily producers of precious or base 
metals and  may become interested in the types of deposits on  which Golden is  focused,  which  include  silver and other 
precious  metals  deposits  or  polymetallic  deposits  containing  significant  quantities  of  base  metals,  including  zinc,  lead, 
copper  and  gold.  Many  of  these  companies  have  greater  financial  resources,  operational  experience  and  technical 
capabilities than Golden does. Golden may encounter increasing competition from other mining companies in its efforts to 
acquire  mineral properties and hire experienced  mining professionals. Increased competition in Golden’s business could 
adversely  affect  its  ability  to  attract  necessary  capital  funding,  acquire  suitable  producing  properties  or  prospects  for 
mineral exploration in the future or maintain and develop Golden’s mine services business.

Golden’s  principal  stockholder  will  be  able  to  exert  significant  influence  over  matters  submitted  to  stockholders  for 
approval, which could delay or prevent a change in corporate control or result in the entrenchment of management or 
the board of directors, possibly conflicting with the interests of Golden’s other stockholders.
Sentient  owns  approximately  19.3%  of  Golden’s  issued  and  outstanding  shares  of  common  stock.  In  addition,  Sentient 
currently has the right to have an observer attend meetings of the Golden Board, and one of Golden’s directors, Mr. Hume, 
is  a  former  principal  of  Sentient.    Sentient  has  the  right  to  nominate  a  director  for  election  by  Golden’s  shareholders. 
Because  of  Sentient’s  major  shareholding,  Sentient  could  exert  significant  influence  in  determining  the  outcome  of 
corporate actions requiring stockholder approval. This could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or 
entrenching  Golden’s  management  or  the  board  of  directors,  which  could  conflict  with  the  interests  of  Golden’s  other 
stockholders and, consequently, could adversely affect the market price of Golden’s common stock.
Consolidated Capitalization
The following table sets forth the consolidated capitalization, cash, cash equivalents and short-term bank debt of Golden as 
at March 31, 2011, before and after giving effect to the issuance of 16,004,066 shares of Golden Stock, 661,750 Golden 
Replacement Options and 2,218,292 Golden Replacement Warrants pursuant to the Arrangement, based on the number of 
shares  of  Golden  Stock  outstanding  on  March  31,  2011,  and  assuming  no  ECU  Options,  Golden  Replacement  Options, 
ECU Warrants or Golden Replacement Warrants  have been exercised. The table should be read in conjunction  with  the 
Golden’s  quarterly  report  on  Form  10-Q  for  the  quarterly  period  ended  March  31,  2011  (including  the  management’s 
discussion and analysis contained therein), which is incorporated by reference into this Circular, as well as the Pro Forma

INFORMATION CONCERNING THE COMBINED COMPANY
General
On completion of the Arrangement, Golden as the Combined Company will continue to be a corporation governed by the 
laws of the State of Delaware. After the Effective Date, Golden will own all of the outstanding ECU Shares and ECU shall 
be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Golden.
Golden  expects  that  the  business  operations  of  Golden  and  ECU  will  be  consolidated  and  the  principal  office  of  the 
Combined Company will be located in Golden, Colorado at 350 Indiana Street, Suite 800, Golden, Colorado, 80401, and 
the registered office will be the Corporation Trust Company, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, Delaware, 19801.
Business of the Combined Company
ECU’s Velardeña Properties, Durango, Mexico
Following  completion  of  the  Arrangement,  the  Combined  Company  plans  to  continue  to  operate  the  mines  on  the 
Velardeña Properties and to advance the expansion of these operations as currently being considered by ECU. In 2010, the 
mines  on  the  Velardeña  Properties  produced  approximately  380,000  ounces  of  silver,  10,000  ounces  of  gold,  182,000 
pounds of zinc and 155,000 pounds of lead. In the first quarter of 2011, the mines on the Velardeña Properties produced 
approximately 79,000 ounces of silver, 1,900 ounces of gold, 43,000 pounds of zinc and 47,000 pounds of lead. A plan has 
been  developed  to  test  potential  improvements  to  the  grinding  and  process  controls  and  optimization  of  certain  circuit 
retention times that could result in low cost productivity improvements in the existing oxide plant. A plan is also being 
developed for grade control in the mines that could improve the grade of ore processed through the oxide plant.
Golden  has  developed  a  metallurgical  testing  plan  focused  on  improving  metal  recoveries  and  product  (concentrate) 
qualities  for  the  planned  sulfide  plant.  Golden  intends  to  conduct  various  test  work  to  determine  optimal  metallurgical 
characteristics of both the oxide and sulfide ores. For the planned sulfide plant, crushing, grinding and flotation parameters 
would be examined to produce a process flow sheet which optimizes value from the silver, gold, lead and zinc minerals 
contained in the deposit.

Golden’s El Quevar Project, Salta, Argentina
Golden has been focused on advancing its El Quevar silver project and through June 30, 2011 has completed more than 820
meters  of  development  drifting.    The  drifting  has  encountered  a  large  number  of  mineralized  structures  believed  to  be 
tension faults that were not anticipated in the current model of the El Quevar deposit, in which mineral concentrations are 
modeled  to  follow  the  alteration  envelope.    As  a  result,  Golden  decided  to  delay  completion  of  a  NI  43-101  compliant 
Preliminary Economic Assessment and a planned mid-year 2011 resource update to allow further work to assess the impact 
that these newly discovered structures may have on the mining plan and global El Quevar resource.
As  part  of  this  effort,  Golden  is  currently  examining  the  bulk  mining  potential  of  the  Yaxtché  zone  at  El  Quevar.
Preliminary engineering indicates that an open pit could be feasible on the eastern end of the Yaxtché zone and Golden is 
performing an optimization analysis of the potential pit.  Following completion of these analyses, the Combined Company 
plans to examine the potential for bulk underground mining of the higher grade western zone.  The Combined Company 
may reduce its level of activity in advancing the drift until this work has been completed, as the open pit would encompass 
the area through which the drift would advance.  The fourth quarter 2011 has been targeted for a resource update based on 
the  bulk  mining  studies.   If  these  efforts  are  successful,  the  Combined  Company  plans  to  proceed  with  a  NI  43-101 
compliant Preliminary Economic Assessment in the first half of 2012.
Golden’s Pánuco Exploration Target, Zacatecas, Mexico
Golden has commenced a third drilling program at its Pánuco exploration target at the Zacatecas properties in the state of 
Zacatecas,  Mexico.  Results  from  the  first  two  rounds  of  drilling  have  identified  a  vein  system  striking  one  and  a  half 
kilometres with silver grades up to one kilogram per tonne over more than a meter. More than 70% of the approximately 48 
holes drilled in the first two drilling programs encountered silver mineralization averaging about 270 grams of silver per 
tonne. The third drilling program is planned to include an additional 40 to 50 holes for a total of approximately 100 holes.  
It is expected that the results of the three drilling programs will support preparation of a NI 43-101 compliant estimate in 
the first half of 2012.
Other Golden Exploration Properties
Golden is also advancing other exploration properties, and is currently focused on the three prospects described below.
At the Cochabamba silver prospect in the Ancash Province of Peru, Golden is preparing for a 10 hole program to test an 
outcropping  vein  system  of  more  than  1.5  kilometres  in  length  characterized  by  quartz  and  carbonate  vein  material 
containing gold, silver and base metals. Surface and limited underground sampling has returned up to 10 grams per tonne 
gold, 450 grams per tonne silver and more than 3% combined lead and zinc. A similar occurrence ten kilometres to the 
northeast is characterized by a high grade resource averaging 17 grams per tonne gold and 450 grams per tonne silver.
At the Atlas gold prospect in the Santa Cruz Province of Argentina, Golden is conducting field geologic work to prepare for 
a 10 to 20 drill hole program prior to year-end 2011.  Golden has identified a system at Atlas characterized by epithermal 
veins  in  a  zone  about  1.5  kilometres  in  length  and  40  meters  width  where  surface  channel  sampling  has  returned  gold 
values ranging from 0.5 grams to 10 grams per tonne gold.
At the La Pinta prospect, directly south of Goldcorp’s Penasquito mine in Zacatecas state, Mexico, Golden is conducting a 
geophysical survey in an attempt to define the source of intrusive float anomalous in zinc and silver and up to three grams 
per  tonne  gold  found  on  the  top  of  a  ridge  in  the  center  of  the  property.  Depending  on  the  results  of  this  survey,  the 
Combined Company may drill the prospect in the later part of the year.
Directors and Executive Officers of the Combined Company
Information  about  the  current  directors  and  executive  officers  of  Golden  is  set  forth  in  the  table  below.    The  current 
directors and officers of Golden will continue to serve as the directors and officers of the Combined Company after the 
completion of the Arrangement, with the following changes:

Capital Structure
If the Golden Charter Amendment Proposal is not approved by stockholders at the Golden Meeting, the authorized capital 
of Golden  will continue to consist of 50,000,000 shares of Golden  Stock, US$0.01 par value, and 10,000,000 shares of 
preferred stock, US$0.01 par value.  If the Golden Charter Amendment Proposal is approved by stockholders at the Golden 
Meeting,  the  authorized  capital  of  Golden  will  consist  of  100,000,000  shares  of  Golden  Stock,  US$0.01  par  value,  and 
10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, US$0.01 par value.  In either event, the rights and restrictions of the classes of capital 
stock of Golden will not be affected by the Arrangement.
The share capital of Golden will also remain unchanged as a result of the consummation of the Arrangment, other than the 
issuance of the  Golden Stock contemplated in the  Arrangement, including the Golden  Stock reserved for issuance  upon 
exercise  of  Golden  Replacement  Options  and  Golden  Replacement  Warrants.  As  of  June  24,  2011,  the  date  of  the 
Arrangement Agreement, ECU had 317,081,333 ECU Shares outstanding and an additional 3,000,000 ECU Shares were 
issued  by  ECU  on  July  21,  2011  as  payment  for  the  prior  exercise  of  an  option  to  purchase  an  exploration  property. 
Assuming that no ECU Options or ECU Warrants are exercised after June 24, 2011, ECU would have 320,081,333 ECU 
Shares outstanding, and Golden  would issue approximately 16,004,066 shares of Golden Stock  to ECU Shareholders at 
closing.    The  exact  number  of  shares  of  Golden  Stock  issued  at  closing  will  be  subject  to  adjustment  for  rounding.    In 
addition, an estimated 167,068 shares of Golden Stock would be issued, in the aggregate, to Mr. Roy and Mr. Altmann in 
lieu  of  their  cash  change  of  control  payments.    The  exact  number  of  such  shares  of  Golden  Stock  to  be  issued  will  be 
determined on the Effective Date based upon the VWAP of Golden Stock on the NYSE Amex for the five trading days 
immediately  prior  to  the  Effective  Date  (see  “The  Arrangement  –  Interests  of  Directors  and  Officers  of  ECU  in  the 
Arrangement – Severance and Change of Control Payments”).  In addition, as further discussed below, assuming that none 
of the ECU Options or ECU Warrants are exercised prior to the closing date, 661,750 shares of Golden Stock would be 
issuable  upon  exercise  of  Golden  Replacement  Options  and  2,218,292  shares  of  Golden  Stock  would  be  issuable  upon 
exercise of Golden Replacement Warrants.  A  summary post-Arrangement equity capitalization table is set  forth below.

Golden Replacement Options
As  of  June  24,  2011,  ECU  had  a  total  of  13,235,000  outstanding  ECU  Options  to  purchase  common  shares.    All  ECU 
Options are vested and currently exercisable.
Effective at the closing of the Arrangement, Golden plans to adopt a stock option plan containing substantially the same 
terms as the existing ECU Stock Option Plan, and the Golden Replacement Options will be issued pursuant to this plan. 
Other than the Golden Replacement Options, no awards will be made pursuant to this plan.
The ECU Options were issued to employees, directors or consultants of ECU. Upon termination of employment or other 
service to ECU, the ECU Options are exercisable until the earlier of (i) the original expiration date for the ECU Options, (ii) 
90 days following the termination of employment or service (or, for persons engaged in certain investor relations activities, 
30  days  following  termination  of  employment  or  service),  or  (iii)  in  the  event  of  the  optionholder’s  death,  12  months

following the date of death. The expiration date of the Golden Replacement Options will be identical to the expiration date 
of  the  ECU  Options  for  which  they  are  exchanged,  provided,  however,  that  the  Golden  Replacement  Option  Plan  will 
provide that if any optionholder ceases to be an employee, officer, director or consultant of ECU within 180 days following 
the closing date, the expiration date for the Golden Replacement Options held by such person will be the earlier of (i) the 
original expiration date for the ECU Options, or (ii) two years following the closing of the Arrangement.
If none of the ECU Options are exercised prior to the closing date, the Golden Replacement Options issued to the ECU 
Optionholders would be issuable for an aggregate of approximately 661,750 shares of Golden Stock.  The exact number of 
shares issuable upon exercise of the Golden Replacement Options will be subject to adjustment for rounding.  The number 
of shares of Golden Stock and expiration date of the Golden Replacement Options are set forth in the table below:

Auditors
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, at their principal offices in Denver, Colorado, are the auditors of Golden and shall remain 
the auditors of the Combined Company.
Transfer Agent
Computershare, at their principal offices in Denver, Colorado, is the transfer agent of Golden for Golden Stock and shall be 
the transfer agent of Golden for the Golden Replacement Warrants.
Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Combined Company
At  March  31,  2011,  Golden’s  aggregate  cash  and  short-term  investments  totalled  US$106.1  million,  which  included 
US$104.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and US$1.8 million of short-term investments. Golden’s cash and short-
term  investment  balance  is  lower  than  the  US$121.6  million  in  similar  assets  held  at  December  31,  2010  due  to 
approximately US$16.9 million spent during the three months ended March 31, 2011 on the El Quevar Project, exploration 
and  general  and  administrative  activities,  including  changes  in  working  capital,  offset  partially  by  the  receipt  of 
approximately US$1.4 million of common shares in Apogee Silver Ltd. (“Apogee”) in connection with the sale to Apogee 
of the Golden subsidiary holding the Paca Pulacayo property.
As  of  July  13,  2011,  Golden  held  Cdn$15.0  million  of  ECU  Convertible  Notes  which  it  received  through  the  Private 
Placement.  The proceeds of the ECU Convertible Notes are intended to be used by ECU for general corporate purposes 
and  for  ongoing  exploration,  development  and  operations  at  the  Velardeña  Property  until  closing  of  the  proposed 
Arrangement, to the extent that current ECU cash flows from the sale of doré and concentrates are not sufficient to fund 
those expenditures.  Among the ECU expenditures which may be funded from the proceeds of the ECU Convertible Notes 
are expenditures related to the Arrangement and for scheduled debt service.  It is anticipated that ECU’s current cash flow 
from  sales  will  be  sufficient  to  fund  ongoing  operations  at  the  Velardeña  Property  until  closing  of  the  Arrangement. 
However, it is anticipated that prior to closing ECU will spend approximately Cdn$12.5 million of the proceeds from the 
ECU Convertible Notes for costs related to exploration and capital equipment at the Velardeña Property, ECU corporate 
overhead, debt service, and costs related to the Arrangement, including bankers and attorneys fees. Following the closing of 
the Arrangement, the remaining Cdn$2.5 million of proceeds from the ECU Convertible Notes would, unless used for other 
purposes, be available for the Combined Company’s general use.
With Golden’s cash and investment balance at March 31, 2011 of US$106.1 million, and assuming that the Arrangement 
closes  prior  to  the  end  of  September  2011,  the  Combined  Company  plans  to  spend  the  following  amounts  during  the 
remainder of 2011 pursuant to its long-term business strategy:
!
!
!
!
Approximately  US$12.5  million  for  corporate  overhead,  debt  service  and  costs  related  to  the  Arrangement 
incurred by ECU, reflected as a drawdown of proceeds from the Cdn$15.0 million ECU convertible note held by 
Golden;
Approximately US$5.0 million of costs related to the Arrangement incurred by Golden;
Approximately US$22.0 to US$25.0 million to be incurred at the El Quevar Project to fund the continuation of 
exploration  drilling,  underground  drifting,  and  related  technical  engineering  and  project  assessment  to  further 
define  the  extent  of  the  resource  before  completing  an  economic  study.    This  amount  could  be  reduced  if  the 
Combined Company concludes that the advancement of the underground drift is no longer necessary as referenced 
in “Information Concerning the Combined Company – Business of the Combined Company – Golden’s El Quevar 
Project, Salta, Argentina”;
Approximately US$4.0 million of costs related to the advancement of feasibility work at the Velardeña Property 
following  closing  of  the  Arrangement  (it  is  estimated  that  operating  and  continued  development  costs  at  the 
Velardeña  Property  will  be  funded  from  the  sale  of  doré  and  concentrates  produced  from  ongoing  Velardeña 
operations);

Approximately  US$12.0 million  during  the  remainder  of  2011  to  fund  the  drilling  of  two  targets  in  Argentina, 
three in Peru and four in Mexico, and on other generative exploration activities and property holding costs related 
to  the  portfolio  of  exploration  properties  conducted  through  the  principal  exploration  offices  of  the  Combined 
Company located in South America and Mexico.  Additional spending is possible for early and advanced stage 
drilling  programs,  depending  on  the  success  of  the  targeted  exploration  program  and  generative  exploration 
activities;
Approximately US$9.0 million during the remainder of 2011 on debt service and the reduction of other short-term 
liabilities relating to obligations of ECU acquired in the Arrangement;
Approximately US$7.0 million during the remainder of 2011 on general and administrative costs;
Approximately  US$2.0 million  during  the  remainder  of  2011  on  working  capital  and  other  general  corporate 
purposes.
The Combined Company plans to fund the expenditures described above from Golden’s cash and investment balances at 
March 31, 2011 of US$106.1 million and from approximately US$0.3 million from royalties and other income through the 
end  of  2011.  Based  on  these  projections,  the  Combined  Company  would  end  the  year  2011  with  cash  and  investment 
balances of approximately US$30.0 to US$33.0 million.
The actual amount that is spent through the end of 2011 may vary significantly from the amounts specified above, and will 
depend on a number of factors, including the results of continued exploration activities and project assessment work at the 
El Quevar Project and other exploration properties, and the results of continuing operations and further development work 
and project assessment work at the Velardeña District Properties.  There can be no assurance the expenditures planned for 
the  El  Quevar  Project  or  the  Velardeña  District  Properties  will  demonstrate  the  economic  viability  of  either  project.  In 
addition, if expenditures in connection with the repayment of the current term loan of ECU or other unanticipated costs 
arise, this may significantly reduce the amount of cash that the Combined Company currently expects to have available for 
deployment at the El Quevar Project, the Velardeña District Properties or other properties in its exploration portfolio on the 
schedule currently anticipated. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Operations of the Combined Company”.
If  economic  studies  at  either  the  El Quevar  or  Velardeña  projects  are  positive,  significant  additional  capital  would  be 
required to complete development and plant construction associated with the projects. To fund completely either project or 
other exploration drilling programs beyond 2011, the Combined Company will have to raise additional capital or enter into 
other financing arrangements. Sentient has expressed an interest in investing further capital in the Combined Company in 
order  to  maintain  its  current  ownership  of  approximately  19%,  which  could  generate  approximately  US$67.0 million  in 
additional cash at US$17.42 per share, which was the closing price of Golden Stock on the NYSE Amex on July 26, 2011. 
However, no agreement has been reached with Sentient, and it is uncertain whether an additional investment by Sentient 
will occur, the number of shares of Golden Stock that would be purchased, or the amount of cash that would be generated 
by the investment if it were to occur. There can be no assurance that the Combined Company will be successful in raising 
additional  capital  or  obtaining  financing  in  the  future  on  terms  acceptable  to  the  Combined  Company  or  at  all.  If  the 
Combined Company is unable to obtain additional capital or alternative financing arrangements during 2011 or beyond, the 
potential development of the El Quevar Project or the Velardeña Property could be delayed following the completion of 
economic studies and the Combined Company may have to significantly reduce spending on other exploration projects to 
preserve cash.

such information will include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to 
state a material fact required to be stated in such information or necessary in order

identity of any such advisor.

(d)
(e)
nature  of  its  activities  makes  such  qualification  necessary,  except  where  the 
failure to hold such license, permit, certificate, order or other authorization or to 
be so registered or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have an 
ECU Material Adverse Effect.
Authority  Relative  to  this  Agreement.    ECU  has  the  requisite  corporate  power, 
authority and capacity to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations 
hereunder.  The  execution  and  delivery  of  this  Agreement  by  ECU  and  the

authorized  by  the  ECU  Board  and  (other  than  the  approval  of  the  Arrangement 
Resolution as required by the Court) no other corporate proceedings on the part of 
ECU  are  necessary  to  authorize  the  execution  and  delivery  by  ECU  of  this 
Agreement  or the performance by ECU of its obligations under this Agreement 
or  the  Arrangement  pursuant  to  the  Plan  of  Arrangement.  This  Agreement  has 
been  duly  executed  and  delivered  by  ECU  and  constitutes  a  legal,  valid  and 
binding obligation of ECU, enforceable against ECU in accordance with its terms, 
subject to the qualification that such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, 
insolvency,  reorganization  or  other  laws  of  general  application  relating  to  or 
affecting  rights  of  creditors  and  that  equitable  remedies,  including  specific 
performance, are discretionary and may not be ordered.
No  Violations.    Except  as  disclosed  in  Schedule  3.1(e)  to  the  ECU  Disclosure 
Letter,  none  of  the  authorization,  execution  and  delivery  of  this  Agreement  by 
ECU, the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the 
Plan of Arrangement, or compliance by ECU with any of the provisions hereof or 
thereof  will:  (1)  violate,  conflict  with,  or  result  (with  or  without  notice  or  the 
passage of time) in a violation or breach of any provision of, require, except for 
the Key Third Party Consents, any consent, approval or notice under, constitute a 
default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a 
default) or  result in a right of termination or acceleration under, or  result in the 
creation  of  any  Lien  upon  any  of  the  properties  or  assets  of  ECU  or  any  of  its 
subsidiaries, cause any indebtedness to come due before its stated maturity, cause 
any  credit  commitment  to  cease  to  be  available  or  cause  any  payment  or  other 
obligation  to  be  imposed  on  ECU  or  its  subsidiaries,  under  any  of  the  terms, 
conditions  or  provisions  of  (A)  any  Laws  applicable  to  ECU  including,  without 
limitation, applicable Securities  Laws and the  rules and regulations of the TSX, 
(B)  their  respective  articles,  by-laws  or  other  comparable  organizational 
documents  or  resolutions,  or  (C)  any  note,  bond,  mortgage,  indenture,  loan 
agreement,  deed  of  trust,  Lien,  license,  Permit,  or  other  ECU  Contract;  or  (2)

under  any  provisions  of  any  Laws  applicable  to  ECU,  or  any  its  subsidiaries  or 
any  of  their  respective  properties  or  assets;  or  (y)  cause  the  suspension  or 
revocation  of  any  Permit  currently  in  effect  in  respect  of  ECU  or  any  of  its 
subsidiaries  (except,  in  the  case  of  each  of  clauses  (1)  and  (2)  above,  for  such 
violations,  conflicts,  breaches,  defaults,  terminations,  accelerations,  suspensions 
or creations of Liens which, or any consents (expressly excluding the Key Third-

(f)
Party Consents and Key Regulatory Approvals), approvals or notices which if not 
given  or  received,  would  not,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  reasonably  be 
expected  to  have  any  ECU  Material  Adverse  Effect).  The  authorization  of  this 
Agreement,  the  execution  and  delivery  by  ECU  of  this  Agreement,  the 
performance  by  ECU  of  its  obligations  under  this  Agreement,  and  the 
consummation by ECU of the Arrangement, will not give rise to any rights of first 
refusal or trigger any change in control provisions or any restrictions or limitation 
under  any  note,  bond,  mortgage,  indenture,  loan  agreement,  deed  of  trust,  Lien, 
license,  Permit  or  other  ECU  Contract,  or  result  in  the  imposition  of  any 
encumbrance, charge or Lien upon any of ECU’s assets or the assets of any of its 
subsidiaries.

exchangeable or exercisable for, or otherwise evidencing a right or obligation to 
acquire, any securities of ECU (including ECU Shares) or of subsidiaries of ECU. 
All  outstanding  ECU  Shares  have  been  duly  authorized  and  validly  issued,  are 
fully paid and non-assessable, and all ECU Shares issuable upon the exercise of 
the  ECU  Options  and  ECU  Warrants  in  accordance  with  their  terms  have  been

Options,  and  the  ECU  Warrants)  have  been  issued  in  compliance  with  all 
applicable Laws and Securities Laws.  There are no securities of ECU or of any of 
its subsidiaries outstanding which have the right to vote generally (or, other than 
the  ECU  Options,  ECU  Warrants  and  SRP  Rights,  are  convertible  into,  or 
exchangeable or exercisable for securities having the right to vote generally) with 
the  ECU  Shareholders  on  any  matter.    There  are  no  outstanding  contractual  or 
other  obligations  of  ECU  or  any  subsidiary  to  repurchase,  redeem  or  otherwise 
acquire  any  of  its  securities  or  with  respect  to  the  voting  or  disposition  of  any 
outstanding securities of any of its subsidiaries. There are no outstanding bonds, 
debentures or other evidences of indebtedness of ECU or any of its subsidiaries

(i)
(ii)
(iii)
to  the  knowledge  of  ECU,  neither  a  “Flip-in  Event”  nor  a  “Separation 
Time” which could lead to the implementation of the dilutive features of 
the Shareholder Rights Plan has occurred;
the  Arrangement  is  an  “Exempt  Acquisition”  for  purposes  of  the 
Shareholder Rights Plan; and
the  ECU  Board,  with  respect  to  the  Arrangement,  has  deferred  the 
Separation  Time  of  the  SRP  Rights  to  the  Outside  Date,  subject  to  such 
deferral  being  automatically  revoked  upon  the  earlier  termination  of  this 
Agreement in accordance with its terms.
For purposes of this Section 3.1(g) and Section 5.3(a), the terms “Flip-in Event”, 
“Separation Time” and “Exempt Acquisition” shall have the meanings ascribed to 
such terms in the Shareholder Rights Plan.
Reporting  Status  and  Securities  Laws  Matters.    ECU  is  a  “reporting  issuer”  in, 
and  is  not  on  the  list  of  reporting  issuers  in  default  under  applicable  Canadian 
provincial Securities Laws of, each of the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, 
Saskatchewan,  Manitoba,  Ontario,  Québec,  New  Brunswick,  Nova  Scotia,

ECU  and,  to  the  knowledge  of  ECU,  no  inquiry  or  investigation  (formal  or 
informal) of any Securities Authority, is in effect or ongoing or, to the knowledge 
of  ECU,  threatened  or  expected  to  be  implemented  or  undertaken.    The  ECU

which require any subsidiaries of ECU to issue, sell or deliver any shares in its 
share  capital  or  other  ownership  interests,  or  any  securities  or  obligations 
convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, any shares of its share capital

Public Filings.  Since January 1, 2008, ECU has filed all documents in the ECU 
Public Disclosure Record required to be filed by it in accordance with applicable 
Securities Laws with the Securities Authorities or the TSX. All such documents 
and  information  comprising  the  ECU  Public  Disclosure  Record,  as  of  their 
respective  dates  (and  the  dates  of  any  amendments  thereto),  (1)  did  not  contain 
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to 
be  stated  therein  or  necessary  to  make  the  statements  therein,  in  light  of  the 
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, and (2) complied in all 
material  respects  with  the  requirements  of  applicable  Securities  Laws,  and  any 
amendments to the ECU Public Disclosure Record required to be made have been 
filed on a timely basis with the Securities Authorities or the TSX. ECU has not 
filed any confidential material change report with any Securities Authorities that 
at the date of this Agreement remains confidential. There has been no change in a 
material  fact  or  a  material  change  (as  such  term  is  defined  under  the  Québec 
Securities Act) in any of the information contained in the ECU Public Disclosure 
Record, except for changes in material facts or material changes that are reflected 
in a subsequently filed document included in the ECU Public Disclosure Record.
ECU Financial Statements.  ECU’s audited financial statements as at and for the 
fiscal  years  ended  December  31,  2010,  December  31,  2009  and  December  31, 
2008  and  ECU’s  unaudited  interim  financial  statements  as  at  and  for  the  three-
month period ended March 31, 2011 (including in each case, the notes thereto and 
related management’s discussion and analysis) (collectively, the “ECU Financial 
Statements”)  were  prepared  (in  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  Securities 
Laws)  in  accordance  with  Canadian  GAAP,  consistently  applied  and  fairly 
present  in  all  material  respects  the  consolidated  financial  position,  results  of 
operations and changes in financial position of ECU and its subsidiaries as of the 
dates  thereof  and  for  the  periods  indicated  therein  (subject,  in  the  case  of  any 
unaudited  interim  financial  statements,  to  normal  period-end  adjustments)  and 
reflect reserves required by Canadian GAAP, in respect of all material contingent 
liabilities, if any, of ECU and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.  Except as 
required  by  the  changes  to  Canadian  GAAP  and  disclosed  in  ECU’s  unaudited 
financial statements as at and for the three-month period ended March 31, 2011, 
there has been no material change in ECU’s accounting policies since December

subsidiaries, and (iii) accurately and fairly reflect the basis for the ECU Financial 
Statements.  The  corporate  records  and  minute  books  for  each  of  ECU  and  its

duly signed minutes of all meetings of the boards of directors, committees of the 
boards  and  shareholders  and  all  resolutions  passed  by  the  boards  of  directors, 
committees  of  the  boards  and  the  shareholders  other  than  minutes  of  meetings 
held  in  connection  with  the  matters  contemplated  herein  (drafts  of  which  have 
been provided to Golden). The corporate records and minute books for each of the 
subsidiaries  of  ECU  are  true  and  correct  in  all  material  respects  and  have  been 
maintained  in  compliance  with  applicable  Laws,  except  where  failure  to  do  so 
would not in the aggregate have an ECU Material Adverse Effect.
Internal  Control  over  Financial  Reporting.    ECU  maintains  a  system  of  internal 
control over financial reporting that has been designed by ECU’s senior officers, 
or  under  their  supervision,  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the 
reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for 
external  purposes  in  accordance  with  Canadian  GAAP.  ECU’s  internal  control 
over  financial  reporting  is  effective  and  ECU  is  not  aware  of  any  material 
weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting.
No  Undisclosed  Liabilities.    Except  for  intercompany  balances  and  agreements 
solely  between  ECU  and  its  subsidiaries,  ECU  and  its  subsidiaries  have  no 
outstanding material indebtedness or liabilities to third parties and are not party to 
or bound by any suretyship, guarantee, indemnification or assumption agreement, 
or  endorsement  of,  or  any  other  similar  commitment  with  respect  to  the 
obligations, liabilities or indebtedness of any person, other than those specifically 
identified,  and  adequately  provided  for,  in  the  ECU  Financial  Statements  or,  to 
the extent disclosed in the ECU Disclosure Letter, incurred in the ordinary course 
of business since the date of the most recent financial statements of ECU filed on 
SEDAR and consistent with past practice.
No Material Change.  Since December 31, 2010, except as disclosed in the ECU 
Public Disclosure Record, no ECU Material Adverse Effect has occurred, and the 
debt,  business  and  material  property  of  ECU  and  its  subsidiaries  conform  in  all 
respects  to  the  description  thereof  contained  in  the  ECU  Public  Disclosure 
Record; and there has been no dividend or distribution of any kind declared, paid 
or made by ECU on any ECU Shares.
ECU Material Contracts. Schedule 3.1(p) to the ECU Disclosure Letter includes a 
complete and accurate list of all ECU Material Contracts in effect as of the date 
hereof  to  which  ECU  or  any  of  its  subsidiaries  is  a  party.    ECU  has  made 
available in the ECU Public Disclosure Record or in the ECU Data Room true and 
complete copies of all ECU Material Contracts.  All ECU Material Contracts are 
in full force and effect, and ECU or its subsidiaries are entitled to all rights and

-38- 
B-3 
B-41
with their respective terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency 
and other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and subject 
to the qualification that equitable remedies may only be granted in the discretion 
of a court of competent jurisdiction.  ECU and its subsidiaries have complied in 
all material respects with all terms of those ECU Material Contracts to which they 
are  parties,  have  paid  all  amounts  due  thereunder,  have  not  waived  any  rights 
thereunder and no material default or breach exists in respect thereof on the part 
of  ECU  or  any  of  its  subsidiaries  or,  to  the  knowledge  of  ECU  or  any  of  its 
subsidiaries,  on  the  part  of  any  other  party  thereto,  and  no  event  has  occurred 
which,  after  the  giving  of  notice  or  the  lapse  of  time  or  both,  would  constitute 
such a material default or breach or trigger a right of termination of any such ECU 
Material Contracts. As at the date hereof, neither ECU nor any of its subsidiaries 
has received written notice that any party to an ECU Material Contract to which 
they  are  parties  intends  to  cancel,  terminate  or  otherwise  modify  or  not  renew 
such ECU Material Contract, and to the knowledge of ECU, no such action has 
been threatened.
(q)
Non-Competition  and  Restrictions  of  Business.  No  ECU  Contract  contains  any 
non-competition obligation or otherwise restricts in any material way the business 
of  ECU  and  its  subsidiaries,  taken  as  a  whole,  except  to  the  extent  that  such 
restrictions would not in the aggregate have an ECU Material Adverse Effect.
(r)
No Defaults under Leases and Agreements.
(i)
(ii)

any of the leases, permits and other title and operating documents or any 
other agreement or instrument pertaining to the mining assets of ECU or 
any of its subsidiaries to which ECU or any of its subsidiaries is a party or 
by or to which ECU or any of its subsidiaries or any such assets are bound 
or  subject  except  to  the  extent  that  such  defaults  would  not  in  the 
aggregate have an ECU Material Adverse Effect.
ECU  and  its  subsidiaries  are  in  good  standing  under  all,  and  are  not  in 
default  under  any,  and  there  is  no  existing  condition,  circumstance  or 
matter which constitutes or which, with the passage of time or the giving 
of notice, would constitute a default under any, leases, permits and other 
title  and  operating  documents  or  any  other  agreements  and  instruments 
pertaining to the mining assets of ECU or its subsidiaries to which ECU or 
any  of  its  subsidiaries  is  a  party  or  by  or  to  which  ECU  or  any  of  its 
subsidiaries or such assets are bound or subject and, to the knowledge of 
ECU,  all  such  leases,  permits,  title  and  operating  documents  and  other 
agreements  and  instruments  are  in  good  standing  and  in  full  force  and 
effect  and  none  of  the  counterparties  to  such  leases,  permits,  title  and 
operating  documents  and  other  agreements  and  instruments  is  in  default 
thereunder except to the extent that such defaults would not have an ECU

nature  of  its  activities  makes  such  qualification  necessary,  except  where  the

Replacement Options shall be issued in exchange for such ECU Options pursuant to the Plan of 
Arrangement on the basis that:
(a)
(b)
(c)
such Golden Replacement Options will be exercisable to acquire that number of

assigned  would  have  acquired  if  such  holders  had  exercised  such  ECU  Options 
immediately  prior  to  the  Effective  Time  and  had  received  ECU  Shares  in 
exchange therefor; provided, however, that, in the event that the exchange of any 
ECU Options for Golden Replacement Options results in the Golden Option In-

ECU  Stock  Option  Plan,  any  Golden  Replacement  Options  issued  in  exchange 
therefor to persons who cease to be employees, officers, directors or consultants 
of ECU or any of its affiliates within 180 days of the Effective Date shall expire 
on the date that is the earlier of (I) two (2) years following the Effective Date and 
(II) the original expiry date of such ECU Options;

Replacement Options, such calculation to  be applied separately to each  grant of 
ECU Options; and
the  terms  and  conditions  otherwise  applicable  to  such  Golden  Replacement 
Options shall be those set forth in the Golden Replacement Option Plan.

The holder of each ECU Option transferred and assigned to Golden in accordance 
with Section 3.1(h)(i) of the Plan of Arrangement shall cease to be the holder thereof and shall

ECU  Stock  Option  Plan,  the  name  of  such  holder  shall  be  removed  from  the  register  of  ECU 
Options maintained by or on behalf of ECU as of the Effective Time, and all option agreements, 
grants and similar instruments relating to such ECU Option shall be, and shall be deemed to be,

immediately  following  such  transfer  and  assignment  and  Golden  shall  be  deemed  to  have 
executed and delivered  all consents,  releases,  assignments and waivers,  statutory or otherwise, 
required to cancel such ECU Option in accordance with this Section 5.10.

ARTICLE 7
ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS
7.1
Notice and Cure Provisions
Each Party shall  give prompt notice to the other of the occurrence, or failure to 
occur,  at  any  time  from  the  date  hereof  until  the  earlier  to  occur  of  the  termination  of  this 
Agreement  in  accordance  with  its  terms  and  the  Effective  Time  of  any  event  or  state  of  facts 
which occurrence or failure would, or would be likely to:
(a)
(b)
cause any of the representations or warranties of any Party contained herein to be 
untrue or inaccurate in any respect at the Effective Time; or
result  in  the  failure  to  comply  with  or  satisfy  any  covenant,  condition  or 
agreement  to  be  complied  with  or  satisfied  by  any  Party  hereunder  prior  to  the 
Effective Time.
Golden may not exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 
8.2.1(c)(iv) and ECU may not exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 
8.2.1(d)(iv) unless the Party intending to rely thereon has delivered a written notice to the other 
Party specifying in reasonable detail all breaches of covenants, representations and warranties or 
other  matters  which  the  Party  delivering  such  notice  is  asserting  as  the  basis  for  the  non-
fulfilment of the applicable condition or the termination right, as the case may be.  If any such 
notice is delivered, provided that the applicable Party is proceeding diligently to cure such matter 
and  such  matter  is  capable  of  being  cured  (except  matters  arising  out  of  the  failure  to  make 
appropriate disclosure in the Golden Disclosure Letter or the ECU Disclosure Letter, as the case 
may be), no Party may terminate this Agreement until the earlier of: (i) the Outside Date and (ii) 
the expiration of a period of fifteen (15) Business Days from such notice, and then only if such 
matter  has  not  been  cured  by  such  date.  If  such  notice  has  been  delivered  prior  to  either  the 
making  of  the  application  for  the  Final  Order  or  the  filing  of  Articles  of  Arrangement,  such 
application and such filing shall be postponed until the earlier of (i) the expiry of such period and 
(ii)  three  (3)  Business  Days  prior  to  the  Outside  Date.    For  greater  certainty,  in  the  event  that 
such matter is cured within the time period referred to herein without an ECU Material Adverse 
Effect or a Golden Material Adverse Effect, as applicable, this Agreement may not be terminated 
as a result of the cured breach.

Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.2, each Party shall, and shall cause 
its  subsidiaries  and  Representatives  to,  immediately  cease  and  cause  to  be  terminated  any 
solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation with any persons conducted heretofore by 
the Party, its subsidiaries or any Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and, 
in connection therewith, each Party shall discontinue access to any of its confidential information 
(and not establish or allow access to any of its confidential information, or any data room, virtual 
or otherwise) and shall as soon as possible hereafter request, to the extent that it is entitled to do 
so  (and  exercise  all  rights  it  has  to  require)  the  return  or  destruction  of  all  confidential 
information regarding the Party  and its subsidiaries previously provided  to any such person or 
any other person and shall request (and exercise all rights it has to require) the destruction of all 
material  including  or  incorporating  or  otherwise  reflecting  any  confidential  information 
regarding  the  Party  and  its  subsidiaries.    Each  Party  agrees  that  neither  it  nor  any  of  its 
subsidiaries,  shall  terminate,  waive,  amend  or  modify  any  provision  of  any  existing 
confidentiality agreement or any standstill agreement to which it or any of its subsidiaries is a 
party.  Each  Party  shall  enforce  all  standstill,  non-disclosure,  non-disturbance,  non-solicitation, 
use, business purpose and similar covenants to which it or any of its subsidiaries is party (it being 
acknowledged and agreed that the automatic termination, pursuant to the express terms of any 
such  agreement,  of  any  standstill  provisions  thereof  as  a  result  of  the  entering  into  and 
announcement of this Agreement by the Parties shall not be a violation of this Section 7.2.2 and 
that neither Party shall be prohibited from considering a Superior Proposal from a party whose 
standstill obligations terminated automatically upon the entering into and announcement of this 
Agreement).
(a)
7.2.3 
Notwithstanding Sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2 and any other provision of this 
Agreement, if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Date, 
provided  that  ECU  or  Golden,  as  applicable,  is  then  in  compliance  with  all  of  its  obligations 
under  this  Agreement  (including  under  Sections  7.2.1  and  7.2.2),  a  Party  receives  a  bona  fide 
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that its board of directors determines in good faith, after 
consultation  with  the  ECU  Financial  Advisor  or  Golden  Financial  Advisor,  as  applicable,  and 
outside  legal  counsel,  constitutes  or,  if  consummated  in  accordance  with  its  terms  (but  not
-95- 
B-3 
B-98
assuming  away  any  risk  of  non-completion),  would  reasonably  be  expected  to  be  a  Superior 
Proposal,  then  the  Party  may,  provided  it  has  first  complied  with  Section  7.2.4  and  has  first 
entered into, and provided to the other Party an executed copy of, a confidentiality and standstill 
agreement  with  such  person  substantially  in  the  form  of  the  Confidentiality  Agreement 
containing  terms  that  are  no  more  favourable  to  such  person  than  those  found  in  the 
Confidentiality  Agreement  (including,  for  greater  certainty,  standstill  provisions;  provided, 
however,  that  a  limited  waiver  of  such  standstill  provisions  may  be  granted  to  the  extent,  and 
only to the extent, reasonably necessary to permit the relevant Party and its board of directors to 
engage  in  the  activities  expressly  permitted  by  and  in  accordance  with  this  Section  7.2.3  and 
Section 7.2.5 under the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 7.2.3 and Section 7.2.5):
(i)
(ii)
furnish  information  with  respect  to  the  Party  and  its  subsidiaries  to  the 
person making such Acquisition Proposal; and/or
enter into, participate, facilitate and undertake discussions or negotiations 
with,  and  otherwise  cooperate  with  or  assist,  the  person  making  such 
Acquisition Proposal,

in  Recommendation  or  a  Golden  Board  Change
Notwithstanding Section 7.2.1 and any other provision of this Agreement, 
if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Date, provided that 
ECU  or  Golden,  as  applicable,  is  then  in  compliance  with  all  of  its  obligations  under  this 
Agreement (including under Sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2), the board of directors of such Party may 
make  an  ECU  Board  Change 
in 
Recommendation  (collectively,  an  “Adverse  Recommendation  Change”),  as  applicable,  (i) 
following receipt of an Acquisition Proposal that it determines to be a Superior Proposal or (ii) 
solely  in  response  to  any  material  event,  development,  circumstance,  occurrence  or  change  in 
circumstances or facts (including any change in probability or magnitude of circumstances) not 
related to an Acquisition Proposal that was not known to the board of directors of such Party on 
the date hereof (or if known, the magnitude or material consequences of which were not known 
to the board of directors of the Party as of the date hereof) (an “Intervening Event”), in each 
case if it determines in  good faith, after consultation with its legal  advisors, that the failure to 
take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.
In  addition,  nothing  contained  herein  shall  prevent  either  Party  or  its  board  of 
directors from (i) complying with Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) under the U.S. Exchange Act or any 
comparable applicable Law, or making any similar communication to stockholders in connection 
with any amendment to the terms of a tender offer, exchange offer or takeover bid, so long as 
any  action  taken  or  statement  made  to  so  comply  is  consistent  with  the  requirements  of  this 
Article 7, (ii) disclosing factual information regarding the business, financial condition or results 
of operations of such Party or the fact that an Acquisition Proposal has been made, the identity of 
the party making such proposal or the material terms of such proposal, to the extent such Party in 
good faith determines that such information, facts, identity or terms is required to be disclosed 
under  applicable  Law  or  that  failure  to  make  such  disclosure  would  be  inconsistent  with  its
-96-

fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (iii) making any statement or disclosure to such Party’s 
securityholders required by applicable Law; provided that any such action taken or statement or 
disclosure  made  that  relates  to  an  Acquisition  Proposal  shall  be  deemed  to  be  an  Adverse 
Recommendation  Change  unless 
the 
recommendation  contemplated  by  Section  2.5(b)  or  Section  2.11(b),  as  applicable,  in  such 
statement  or  disclosure  or  in  connection  with  such  action  (except  that  a  mere  “stop,  look  and 
listen” disclosure in compliance with Rule 14d-9(f) of the U.S. Exchange Act or any comparable 
applicable Law, shall not constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change).
the  board  of  directors  of  such  Party  reaffirms
7.2.4 
Each  Party  shall  promptly  (and  in  any  event  within  24  hours  of  receipt  by  the 
Party, any subsidiary or any of its Representatives) notify the other Party, at first orally and then 
in writing, of any offer, proposal, expression of interest, or inquiry (oral or in writing) relating to 
or constituting, or which would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, all 
requests for discussions or negotiations relating to an Acquisition Proposal and all requests for 
non-public  information  relating  to  the  Party  or  any  of  its  subsidiaries  or  for  access  to  the 
properties, books or records of the Party or any of its subsidiaries in connection with any actual 
or potential Acquisition Proposal, in each case received on or after the date hereof, of which it or 
any  of  its  subsidiaries,  or  any  of  its  or  their  Representatives,  is  or  becomes  aware,  or  any 
amendments to any of the foregoing. Such notice shall include a description of the material terms 
and  conditions  of  any  such  Acquisition  Proposal  or  offer,  proposal,  expression  of  interest,  or 
inquiry  or  request,  the  identity  of  the  person  making  such  Acquisition  Proposal  or  such  offer,

related  thereto  and  provide  such  other  details  of  such  Acquisition  Proposal  or  offer,  proposal, 
expression  of  interest,  or  inquiry  or  request  as  the  other  Party  may  reasonably  request.  Each 
Party  shall  keep  the  other  Party  fully  informed  on  a  prompt  basis  of  the  status,  including  any 
change  to  the  material  terms,  of  any  such  Acquisition  Proposal  or  such  offer,  proposal, 
expression  of  interest,  or  inquiry  or  request  and  shall  respond  promptly  to  all  inquiries  by  the 
other Party with respect thereto.
7.2.5 
Notwithstanding  anything  in  this  Agreement  to  the  contrary,  but  subject  to 
Section 7.3, if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Date, 
provided  that  the  relevant  Party  is  then  in  compliance  with  all  of  it  obligations  under  this 
Agreement  (including  under  Section  7.2),  either  ECU  or  Golden  receives  an  Acquisition 
Proposal which its board of directors concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, its 
board of directors may, subject to compliance with the applicable procedures set forth in Section 
7.3 and Section 8.2, terminate this Agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement with 
respect to such Superior Proposal.

Right to Match or Respond to a Potential Adverse Recommendation Change
7.3.1 
Each  Party  covenants  that  it  shall  not  approve,  accept,  endorse,  recommend  or 
enter into any agreement, understanding or arrangement in respect of a Superior Proposal (other

Recommendation Change unless:
-97-

B-100
(a)
(b)
such  party  (the  “Notifying  Party”)  has  complied  with  its  obligations  under 
Section 7.2 and the other provisions of this Article 7 and has provided the other 
Party (the “Notified Party”) with a copy of the Superior Proposal or a reasonably 
detailed description of the relevant Intervening Event, as applicable; and
a period (the “Response Period”) of five (5) Business Days has elapsed from the 
date that is the later of (x) the date on which the Notified Party receives written 
notice  from  the  ECU  Board  or  the  Golden  Board,  as  applicable,  that  it  has 
determined, subject only to compliance with this Section 7.3, to approve, accept, 
endorse, recommend or enter into a binding written agreement to proceed with the 
Superior Proposal or to make the Adverse Recommendation Change, and (y) the 
date the Notified Party receives a copy of the Superior Proposal or the description 
of the Intervening Event, as applicable.
7.3.2 
During the Response Period, the Notified Party  shall have the right, but not the 
obligation, to offer to amend the terms of this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement.  During 
the Response Period, the Notifying Party shall negotiate in good faith with the Notified Party to 
make such amendments to the terms of this Agreement and the Arrangement as would enable the 
Notifying  Party  and  the  Notified  Party  to  proceed  with  the  transactions  contemplated  by  this 
Agreement  on  such  amended  terms  or  to  obviate  the  need  for  the  Adverse  Recommendation 
Change.    Within  five  (5)  Business  Days  (the  “Review  Period”)  of  any  such  proposal  by  the 
Notified Party to amend the terms of this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement, including an 
increase in, or modification of, the aggregate Consideration and an alteration of the nature of the 
transactions  contemplated  hereby,  the  ECU  Board  or  the  Golden  Board,  as  applicable,  shall 
review  and  determine  whether  the  Acquisition  Proposal  to  which  the  Notified  Party  is 
responding would continue to be a Superior Proposal , or whether the Adverse Recommendation 
Change is still necessary, when assessed in light of this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement 
as they are proposed by the Notified Party to be amended. Such determination shall be made by 
the  ECU  Board  or  the  Golden  Board,  as  applicable,  in  consultation  with  the  ECU  Financial 
Advisor and ECU Fairness Advisor or Golden Financial Advisor, as applicable, and outside legal 
counsel,  and  shall  be  communicated  to  the  Notified  Party  by  no  later  than  the  last  day  of  the 
Review  Period.  If  the  ECU  Board  or  the  Golden  Board,  as  applicable,  determines  that  the 
Acquisition  Proposal  to  which  the  Notified  Party  is  responding  would  not  continue  to  be  a 
Superior  Proposal,  or  the  Adverse  Recommendation  Change  would  not  be  necessary,  when 
assessed  in  light  of  this  Agreement  and  the  Plan  of  Arrangement  as  they  are  proposed  by  the 
Notified  Party  to  be  amended,  the  Notifying  Party  shall  enter  into  an  amendment  to  this 
Agreement  to  give  effect  to  such  amendments  and  the  ECU  Board  or  the  Golden  Board,  as 
applicable, shall promptly reaffirm its recommendation of the Plan of Arrangement on the same 
basis as described in Section 2.5(b) or Section 2.11(b), as applicable, by the prompt issuance of a 
press release to that effect.  If the ECU Board or the Golden Board, as applicable, determines that 
the Acquisition Proposal, if any, to which the Notified Party is responding would continue to be 
a Superior Proposal when assessed against this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement as they 
are  proposed  by  the  Notified  Party  to  be  amended,  the  Notifying  Party  may  approve  and 
recommend  that  ECU  Securityholders  or  Golden  Stockholders,  as  applicable,  accept  such 
Superior  Proposal  and  may  terminate  this  Agreement  pursuant  to  Section  8.2.1(c)(ii)  or 
8.2.1(d)(ii), as applicable, in order to accept or enter into a binding written agreement to proceed 
with the Superior Proposal; provided that, for greater certainty, any determination by the board

of  directors  of  the  Notifying  Party  to  approve  and  recommend  that  ECU  Securityholders  or 
Golden  Stockholders,  as  applicable,  accept  such  Superior  Proposal  without  terminating  this 
Agreement  pursuant  to  Section  8.2.1(c)(ii)  or  8.2.1(d)(ii),  as  applicable,  shall  for  all  purposes 
hereof  constitute  an  ECU  Board  Change  in  Recommendation  or  a  Golden  Board  Change  in 
Recommendation, as applicable; and provided further that the Notifying Party shall pay the ECU 
Termination  Fee  or  the  Golden  Termination  Fee,  as  applicable,  required  by  Section  7.4 
concurrently  with  any  such  termination  of  this  Agreement  pursuant  to  Section  8.2.1(c)(ii)  or 
8.2.1(d)(ii), as applicable.
7.3.3 
Where  the  Notifying  Party  has  provided  the  Notified  Party  notice  pursuant  to 
Section 7.3.1(b) and the ECU Meeting or the Golden Meeting, as applicable, is scheduled to be 
held  prior  to  the  expiry  of  the  Response  Period  or  the  Review  Period  and  the  Notified  Party 
requests  in  writing  that  the  ECU  Meeting  or  the  Golden  Meeting,  as  applicable,  proceed,  the 
Notifying Party shall continue to take all reasonable steps necessary to hold the ECU Meeting or 
the  Golden  Meeting,  as  applicable,  and  to  cause  the  Arrangement  Resolution  or  the  Golden 
Meeting Resolution, as applicable, to be voted on at the ECU Meeting or the Golden Meeting, as 
applicable.    Alternatively,  if  directed  to  do  so  by  the  Notified  Party,  the  Notifying  Party  shall 
postpone or adjourn the ECU Meeting or the Golden Meeting, as applicable, as directed by the 
Notified Party to a date designated by the Notified Party (which shall not be later than twenty 
(20) days after the scheduled date of the ECU Meeting or the Golden Meeting, as applicable, or 
the reconvening of any previous postponement or adjournment thereof and not later than five (5) 
Business  Days  prior  to  the  Outside  Date),  and  the  ECU  Board  or  the  Golden  Board,  as 
applicable,  shall  waive  the  proxy-cut  off  time  if  requested  to  do  so  by  the  Notified  Party  and 
shall, in the event that the Parties amend the terms of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.3.2, 
ensure  that  the  details  of  such  amended  Agreement  are  communicated  to  the  ECU 
Securityholders  or  the  Golden  Stockholders,  as  applicable,  prior  to  the  resumption  of  the 
postponed or adjourned ECU Meeting or the Golden Meeting, as applicable.
7.3.4 
Each  successive  amendment  to  any  of  the  material  terms  of  an  Acquisition 
Proposal shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for the purposes of this Section 7.3 and the 
Notified  Party  shall  be  afforded  a  new  Response  Period  and  the  rights  afforded  in  paragraph 
7.3.2 in respect of each such Acquisition Proposal.

those agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Each Party acknowledges that 
all of the payment amounts set out in this Section 7.4 are payments of liquidated damages which 
are a genuine pre-estimate of the damages, which the Party entitled to such damages will suffer 
or incur as a result of the event giving rise to such damages and the resultant termination of this 
Agreement and are not penalties. Each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise as

Nothing in this Section 7.4 shall preclude a Party from seeking injunctive relief to

Governing Law
This  Agreement  shall  be  governed  by  and  construed  in  accordance  with  the 
internal  laws  of  the  State  of  New  York  without  giving  effect  to  any  choice  or  conflict  of  law

the application of Laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of New York. Each Party 
consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and proper venue of the state and federal courts located in 
New York, New York for any claim, dispute or controversy hereunder in any such suit, action or 
proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent, any argument that any such suit, action 
or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in 
any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any Party anywhere in the world, whether 
within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Each of the Parties, knowingly, voluntarily 
and intentionally waives any right to trial by jury in any action or other legal proceeding brought 
by the other Party arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated

Québec and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein.

Injunctive Relief
Subject  to  Section  7.4,  the  Parties  agree  that  irreparable  harm  would  occur  for  which  money 
damages would not be an adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this 
Agreement  were  not  performed  in  accordance  with  their  specific  terms  or  were  otherwise 
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions 
other  equitable  relief  (including  specific  performance)  to  prevent  breaches  of  this  Agreement, 
any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any 
such injunctive or other equitable relief (including specific performance) hereby being waived.

severally with such affiliate for all of its obligations hereunder.  This Agreement shall be binding

Severability
If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of 
being enforced by any rule or Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this 
Agreement  shall  nevertheless  remain  in  full  force  and  effect  so  long  as  the  economic  or  legal 
substance  of  the  transactions  contemplated  hereby  is  not  affected  in  any  manner  materially 
adverse to any Party.  Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal

pursuant to Section 4.5, and any certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 4.1, each certificate that immediately 
prior to the Effective Time  represented ECU Shares or ECU Warrants shall be deemed 
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the 
Consideration  to  which  the  holder  thereof  is  entitled  in  lieu  of  such  certificate  as 
contemplated by Section 3.1 and this Section 4.1, less any amounts withheld pursuant to 
Section 4.5. Any such certificate formerly representing ECU Shares or ECU Warrants 
not duly surrendered on or before the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date shall:
(i)
cease to represent a claim by, or interest of, any former holder of ECU Shares or 
ECU  Warrants  of  any  kind  or  nature  against  or  in  ECU  or  Golden  (or  any 
successor to any of the foregoing); and
(ii)
be deemed to have been surrendered to Golden and shall be cancelled.
C-13
- 14 -
(d)
(e)
Any  right  or  claim  to  payment  hereunder  that  remains  outstanding  on  the  sixth 
anniversary of the Effective Date shall cease to represent a right or claim of any kind or 
nature  whatsoever  and  the  right  of  the  former  ECU  Securityholder  to  receive  the 
Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement shall 
terminate and be deemed to be surrendered and forfeited, for no consideration, to Golden 
(or any successor of Golden).
No holder of ECU Securities shall be entitled to receive any consideration with respect to 
such ECU Securities other than the Consideration  to which such holder is entitled in 
accordance with Section 3.1 and this Section 4.1 and, for greater certainty, no such 
holder will be entitled to receive any interest, dividends, premium or other payment in 
connection therewith.
4.2
Lost Certificates
In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented 
one or more outstanding  ECU Shares or ECU Warrants that are entitled to Consideration pursuant to 
Section  3.1  shall  have  been  lost,  stolen  or  destroyed,  upon  the  making  of  an  affidavit  or  statutory 
declaration of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and who was 
listed immediately prior to the Effective Time as the registered holder thereof on the share register or 
warrant  register  maintained  by  or  on  behalf  of  ECU,  as  applicable,  the  Depositary  will  deliver  in 
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the Consideration that such holder is entitled to 
receive in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, provided that the holder to whom the 
Consideration is to be delivered shall, as a condition precedent to the delivery, give a bond satisfactory to 
Golden  and  the  Depositary  in  such  sum  as  Golden  and  the  Depositary  may  direct  (each  acting 
reasonably), or otherwise indemnify Golden and the Depositary in a manner satisfactory to Golden and 
the Depositary (each acting reasonably) against any claim that may be made against Golden or the 
Depositary with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
4.3
Distributions with Respect to Unsurrendered Certificates
No dividend or other distribution declared or paid after the Effective Time with respect to 
Golden Stock shall be delivered to the holder of any certificate formerly representing ECU Shares unless 
and until the holder of such certificate shall have complied with the provisions of Section 4.1.  Subject to 
applicable law and to Section 4.1  at the time of such compliance, there shall, in addition to the delivery 
of the Consideration to which such holder is thereby entitled, be delivered to such holder, without 
interest, the amount of any dividend or other distribution declared or made after the Effective Time with 
respect to the Golden Stock to which such holder is entitled in respect of such holder’s Consideration.
4.4
No Fractional Securities
No  fractional  shares  of  Golden  Stock,  fractional  Golden  Replacement  Options  or 
fractional  Golden  Replacement  Warrants  shall  be  issued  to  any  person  pursuant  to  this  Plan  of 
Arrangement.    The  number  of  shares  of  Golden  Stock,  Golden  Replacement  Options  and  Golden 
Replacement Warrants to be issued to any person pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement shall be rounded 
up or down, as applicable, to the nearest whole share of Golden Stock. For greater certainty, where such 
fractional  interest  is  greater  than  or  equal  to  0.5,  the  number  of  shares  of  Golden  Stock,  Golden 
Replacement Options or Golden Replacement Warrants, as applicable, to be issued will be rounded up to 
the nearest whole number and where such fractional interest is less than 0.5, the number of shares of
C-14
- 15 -
Golden Stock, Golden Replacement Options or Golden Replacement Warrants, as applicable,  to be 
issued will be rounded down to the nearest whole number. In calculating such fractional interests, all 
ECU Shares, ECU Options or ECU Warrants, as applicable, registered in the name of or beneficially held 
by an ECU Securityholder or its nominee shall be aggregated.
4.5
Withholding Rights
Golden, ECU and the Depositary, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold 
from any Consideration payable or otherwise deliverable to any former holder of ECU Securities such 
amounts as Golden, ECU and the Depositary may be required to deduct and withhold therefrom under 
any provision of applicable Laws in respect of Taxes.  To the extent that such amounts are so deducted 
and withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes hereof as having been paid to the person to 
whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.  Golden, ECU or the Depositary, as applicable, 
may sell or otherwise dispose of such portion of the Consideration otherwise payable to such holder  as is 
necessary to provide sufficient funds to enable Golden, ECU or the Depositary, as applicable, to comply 
with  such  deduction  and/or  withholding  requirements  and  Golden,  ECU  and  the  Depositary,  as 
applicable, shall notify the holder thereof and remit any unapplied balance of the net proceeds of such 
sale.
4.6
Calculations
All  aggregate  amounts  of  cash  consideration  to  be  received  under  this  Plan  of 
Arrangement will be calculated to the nearest cent ($0.01).  All calculations and determinations made in 
good faith by Golden, ECU or the Depositary, as applicable, for the purposes of this Plan of Arrangement 
shall be conclusive, final, and binding.
ARTICLE 5
DISSENT RIGHTS

- 16 -
(d)
the fair value payable by Golden to a Dissenting Shareholder, may, at the option of 
Golden, be paid by way of issuance of shares of Golden Stock.
In no case shall Golden, ECU or any other person be required to recognize any holder of ECU Shares 
who exercises Dissent Rights as a holder of ECU Shares after the Effective Time.
Registered holders of ECU Shares who renounce, or are deemed to renounce, their right to demand the 
repurchase of their ECU Shares shall be deemed to have participated in the Arrangement, as of the 
Effective Time, and shall be entitled to receive the consideration to which holders of ECU Shares who 
have not exercised Dissent Rights are entitled under Section 3.1(f) hereof (less any amounts withheld 
pursuant to Section 4.5).
For greater certainty, (a) no holder of ECU Options, ECU Warrants or Convertible Notes shall be entitled 
to  Dissent  Rights  in  respect  of  such  holder’s  ECU  Options,  ECU  Warrants  or  Convertible  Notes 
(including, for greater certainty, any ECU Shares issued to a holder of Convertible Notes in connection 
with the exchange of Convertible Notes pursuant to Section 3.1(a) hereof) and (b) in addition to any 
other restrictions in Chapter XIV of the QBCA, no ECU Shareholder who has failed to exercise all the 
voting  rights  carried  by  the  ECU  Shares  held  by  such  ECU  Shareholder  against  the  Arrangement 
Resolution shall be entitled to exercise Dissent Rights with respect to the Arrangement.

C-17
EXHIBIT A
EXAMPLE OF CALCULATION OF
GOLDEN REPLACEMENT OPTION EXERCISE PRICE
An ECU Optionholder has been granted ECU Options which, if fully exercised, would entitle the 
ECU Optionholder to acquire 1,000 ECU Shares.
The exercise price of such ECU Options is $1 per ECU Option, or $1,000 in the aggregate.
On the Arrangement being implemented, an ECU Shareholder holding 1,000 ECU Shares would 
receive 50 (being 1,000 multiplied by the Exchange Ratio) shares of Golden Stock.
The  ECU  Optionholder  will,  on  implementation  of  the  Arrangement,  receive  Golden 
Replacement Options which, if fully exercised, will entitle the ECU Optionholder to acquire  50 
shares of Golden Stock.
The exercise price of such Golden Replacement Options is, in the aggregate, $1000 and, upon 
payment of such aggregate exercise price, the ECU Optionholder would receive 50 shares of 
Golden Stock.
Therefore, the exercise price per Golden Replacement Option will be equal to $1,000 ÷ 50, or 
$20.00.

APPENDIX D –
FAIRNESS OPINION
June 23, 2011 
 
The Board of Directors 
ECU Silver Mining Inc. 
87 Front Street East, 2nd Floor 
Toronto, ON M5E 1B8
To the Board of Directors:
Stonecap  Securities  Inc.  (“Stonecap”)  understands  that  ECU  Silver  Mining  Inc.  (“ECU”)  will  enter  into  a  definitive 
agreement (the “Arrangement Agreement”) with Golden Minerals Company (“Golden Minerals”) pursuant to which 
the two companies will combine by way of plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (Quebec) (the 
“Arrangement”) whereby ECU shareholders will receive 0.05 of a common share of Golden Minerals and $0.000394 
in  cash  for  each  common  share  of  ECU  held  immediately  prior  to  the  effective  date  of  the  Arrangement.  The 
Arrangement will be subject to customary conditions, including regulatory and ECU securityholder approval. Detailed 
terms and conditions and other matters relating to the Arrangement are set forth in the Arrangement Agreement and 
will  be  described  in  the  information  circular  (the  “Information  Circular”),  which  will  be  mailed  to  holders  of  ECU 
securities in connection with the transaction.
Engagement
ECU  initially  contacted  Stonecap  regarding  a  potential  advisory  assignment  on  June  9,  2011.    Pursuant  to  an 
engagement  letter  dated  June  10,  2011,  Stonecap  was  retained  by  ECU  to  provide  services  that  included  the 
preparation to the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of ECU of a fairness opinion (the “Fairness Opinion”) as to the 
fairness,  from  a  financial  point  of  view,  of  the  Arrangement  to  the  holders  of  ECU  common  shares  (the 
“Engagement”). Prior to the execution of the Arrangement Agreement, Stonecap, at the Board’s request, provided a 
verbal opinion (the “Verbal Opinion”) to the Board on June 23, 2011, stating that, in its opinion, as of such date, the 
consideration for the Arrangement was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of common shares of ECU 
(other than securities of ECU, if any, held by Golden Minerals and its affiliates). Stonecap has not been engaged to 
prepare a valuation of ECU, Golden Minerals or any of their respective securities or assets, and the Fairness Opinion 
should not be construed as such, nor should it be viewed as a recommendation to any holders of common shares to 
accept the recommendation of the Board to vote in favour of the Arrangement. Stonecap’s Fairness Opinion is not, 
and should not be construed as, advice as to the price at which common shares of ECU or Golden Minerals (before 
or after the completion of the Arrangement) may trade at any future date.
Stonecap will be paid a fee by ECU in connection with the delivery of the Fairness Opinion and will be reimbursed for 
any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and will be indemnified by ECU in certain circumstances. Stonecap’s fee is 
not  contingent  on  any  conclusions  as  to  the  fairness  of  the  consideration  offered  under  the  Arrangement  and  was 
only  payable  subject  to  and  upon  delivery  of  the  Verbal  Opinion  to  the  Board.  Stonecap  understands  that  this 
Fairness  Opinion  and  summary  thereof  may  be  included  in  any  regulatory  filings  and  Stonecap  consents  to  such 
filings, provided that it is given an opportunity to review such disclosure prior to the filing.
Credentials of Stonecap
Stonecap  provides  quality  independent  research,  experienced  Canadian  equity  sales  coverage,  trading  execution 
and investment banking services to an extensive network of North American institutional and corporate clients. The 
principals  of  Stonecap  have  been  involved  in  a  significant  number  of  transactions  involving  fairness  opinions  and 
valuations  of private  and  publicly-traded  companies.  The  professionals  involved  in  the  preparation  of  this  Fairness 
Opinion include senior officers and directors of Stonecap who are experienced in merger, acquisition and divestiture 
matters. The Fairness Opinion expressed herein represents the opinion of Stonecap and the form and content thereof 
have been approved for release by its Management Committee.
Relationship with ECU
Stonecap is not an insider, associate or affiliate (as those terms are defined in the Securities Act (Ontario)) of ECU or 
any of its respective associates or affiliates. Other than the Engagement, Stonecap has not been engaged to provide

any financial advisory services nor has it participated in any financings involving ECU or Golden Minerals or any of 
their respective associates or affiliates within the past two years.
Stonecap acts as a trader and dealer, both as principal and agent, in all major financial markets in Canada and, as 
such,  may  have  had,  and  may  in  the  future  have,  positions  in  the  securities  of  ECU  and,  from  time  to  time,  may 
execute transactions for ECU and on behalf of clients for which it received or may receive compensation. In addition, 
Stonecap, as an investment dealer, conducts research on securities and may, in the ordinary course of its business, 
provide research reports and investment advice to its clients on investment matters, including with respect to ECU.

Assumptions and Limitations
With the Board’s approval and agreement, we have relied upon the completeness, accuracy and fair presentation of 
all financial information, business plans, forecasts and other information, data, advice, opinions and representations 
obtained by us from public sources, or provided to us by ECU, its subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, 
associates,  affiliates,  consultants,  advisors  and  representatives,  in  each  case  relating  to  ECU,  its  subsidiaries, 
associates  and  affiliates,  and  to  the  Arrangement.  Our  Fairness  Opinion  is  conditional  upon  such  completeness, 
accuracy  and  fair  presentation. We  have  not  been  requested  or,  subject  to  the  exercise  of  professional  judgment, 
attempted  to  verify  independently  the  completeness,  accuracy  or  fair  presentation  of  any  such  information,  data, 
advice, opinions and representations.
In addition to that set out in the paragraph immediately below, senior officers of ECU have represented to Stonecap 
in  a certificate  delivered  as  of  the date  hereof, among  other  things,  that  (i)  the information,  data,  advice,  opinions, 
representations and other material (financial and otherwise) (the “Information”) provided orally by, or in the presence 
of,  an  officer  or  employee  of  ECU  or  in  writing  by  ECU  or  any  of  its  subsidiaries,  associates  or  affiliates  or  their 
respective directors, officers, associates, affiliates, consultants, advisors and representatives to Stonecap or obtained 
by  Stonecap  from  SEDAR  relating  to  ECU,  its  subsidiaries,  associates  or  affiliates,  the  Arrangement  or  any  other 
transaction,  for  the  purpose  of  preparing  the  Fairness  Opinion  was,  at  the  date  such  Information  was  provided  to 
Stonecap and remains as of the date hereof, complete, true and correct in all material respects, and did not and does 
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact in respect of ECU, its  subsidiaries, associates or affiliates, the
181 Bay Street, Brookfield Place, Suite 900, P.O. Box 779, Toronto ON M5J 2T3
Stonecap Securities Inc.
D-3
Arrangement or any other transaction and did not and does not omit to state a material fact in respect of ECU, its 
subsidiaries, associates or affiliates, the Arrangement or any other transaction necessary to make the Information or 
any  statement  contained  therein  not  misleading  in  light  of  the  circumstances  under  which  the  Information  was 
provided or any statement was made; and (ii) since the dates on which the Information was provided to Stonecap, 
except as disclosed in writing to Stonecap, there has been no material change, financial or otherwise, in the financial 
condition,  assets,  liabilities  (contingent  or  otherwise),  business,  operations  or  prospects  of  ECU  or  any  of  its 
subsidiaries and no material change has occurred in the Information or any part thereof which would have or which 
would reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the Fairness Opinion; except for changes that have been 
updated by more current Information provided in writing to Stonecap.
ECU and Golden Minerals have each represented to Stonecap that there have not been bona fide offers for or any 
prior valuations (as defined in Multilateral Instrument 61-101) or expert report regarding, ECU or Golden Minerals or 
their material assets or securities in the past two years.
With respect to any forecasts, projections, estimates and/or budgets provided to Stonecap and used in its analyses, 
Stonecap  notes  that  projecting  future  results  of  any  company  is  inherently  subject  to  uncertainty.  Stonecap  has 
assumed, however, that such forecasts, projections, estimates and/or budgets were prepared using the assumptions 
identified  therein,  which,  in  the  opinion  of  ECU,  are  (or  were  at  the  time  and  continue  to  be)  reasonable  in  the 
circumstances.
In  preparing the  Fairness  Opinion,  Stonecap has  made  several assumptions,  including  that  (i)  all  of  the conditions 
required to implement the Arrangement will be met and that all consents, permissions, exemptions or orders of third 
parties and relevant authorities will be obtained without adverse condition or qualification, (ii) the Arrangement can 
proceed  as  scheduled  and  without  material  additional  cost  to  ECU  or  liability  of  ECU  to  third  parties,  and  (iii)  the 
disclosure provided or incorporated by reference in the Information Circular with respect to ECU and its subsidiaries 
and  affiliates  and  the  Arrangement  is  accurate  in  all  material  respects.    Stonecap  is  not  legal  counsel,  tax  or 
accounting  experts  and  it  expresses  no  opinion  concerning  any  legal,  tax,  regulatory  or  accounting  matters 
concerning the Arrangement.
Stonecap  has  not  been  engaged  to  provide  and  has  not  provided:  (i)  a  formal  valuation  of  ECU  or  its  securities 
pursuant  to  Multilateral  Instrument  61-101  –  Protection  of  Minority  Security  Holders  in  Special  Transactions  or 
otherwise;  (ii)  an  opinion  concerning  the  future  trading  price  of  any  of  the  securities  of  ECU  or  Golden  Minerals 
following  the  completion  of  the  Arrangement;  (iii)  an  opinion  as  to  the  fairness  of  the  process  underlying  the 
Arrangement;  or  (iv)  a  recommendation  to  any  securityholder  of  ECU  to  vote  their  securities  in  favour  of  the 
Arrangement; and, in each case, this Fairness Opinion should not be construed as such.
Approach to Fairness
The  preparation  of  a  fairness  opinion  involves  various  determinations  as  to  the  most  appropriate  and  relevant 
assumptions and methods of financial analysis and the application of these methods to the particular circumstances 
and, therefore, a fairness opinion is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Qualitative 
judgments were made based upon Stonecap’s assessment of the surrounding factual circumstances relating to the 
Arrangement  and  Stonecap’s  analysis  of  such  factual  circumstances  in  its  best  judgment.    Any  attempt  to  select 
portions of Stonecap’s analyses or of the factors considered, without considering all of the analyses employed and 
factors  considered,  would  likely  create  an  incomplete  and misleading  view  of  the  process  underlying  this  Fairness 
Opinion.  This Fairness Opinion should be read in its entirety.
General
Our  Fairness  Opinion  is  rendered,  and  is  effective,  as  at  the  date  hereof  and  on  the  basis  of  securities  markets, 
economic  and  general  business  and  financial  conditions  prevailing  as  at  the  date  hereof  and  the  conditions  and 
prospects, financial and otherwise, of ECU as they are reflected in the Information and as they were represented to 
us in our discussions with the management of ECU. In our analyses and in connection with the preparation of our 
Fairness Opinion, we made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, market 
and  economic  conditions  and  other  matters,  many  of  which  are  beyond  the  control  of  Stonecap  and  any  party 
involved in the Arrangement.

This Fairness Opinion is provided to the Board of ECU for their use only and may not be relied upon by any other

, [2] This application concerns an arrangement agreement «Agreement» concluded
, on June 24, 2011 with the US Corporation Golden Minerals Company «Golden» whose
shares are traded on the NYSE Amex under the symbol «AUMN ». ]
[8] ECU summarizes the Agreement as follow:
«[2] [,,,] Under the Plan of Arrangement, ECU Securityholders (as defined
herein), other than holders of ECU Convertible Notes (as delined herein), are
exchanging their respective ECU Securities (as defined herein) for money and
securities of another legal person, namely Golden, as contemplated by Section

Agreement, including the Plan of Arrangement and other Schedules thereto, is
filed in support hereof as Exhibit R71.
[3] The Arrangement represents a merger of equals (the “Merger") between ECU
and Golden with a view to creating a newjunior silver mining company having a
diversified portfolio of assets, and providing the shareholders of both companies
an opportunity to participate in a strongly positioned company with an attractive
project pipeline for future growth. The combined corporate growth plans of both
parties will be accelerated using Golden's operating experience and ECU's
strong record of excellence in exploration and discovery.
[4] Upon completion of the Arrangement, current ECU Shareholders (as defined
herein) and holders of Golden Stock (as defined herein) will own, on a non-
diluted basis, approximately 51% and 49%, respectively, and, on a fully diluted
basis, approximately 55% and 45%, respectively, of outstanding common stock,
par value U.S.$0,071 of Golden (“Golden Stock"), which, following completion of
the Arrangement, will be the parent company of ECU [Golden together with its
wholly—owned subsidiary ECU will be referred to es the “Combined Company").»

ANALYSIS
The arrangement under the QBCA
[5] OBCA came into effect on February 14, 20112. it replaces the tormer and
outdated Companies Act — Quebec.
[6] Its Chapter XVI — Division ll, which concerns an arrangement, is similar to
Sections 192 and 248 of the Canada Business Corporations Act (CBCA) as it was
stated by the Quebec Minister of Finance M. Bachand. during the «Commission
permanente destinances pubiiques» held before the adoption of the QBCAS.
[7] However, we must keep in mind that similar does not mean identical.
[8] To this eﬁect, ECU's Counsel Paul Martel, in his book La société par actions au
Quebec‘, which has authoritative status in this Province, points out some notable
differences between both systems. He writes:

I «lg-253 La Loi sur les compagmes, prevoyait un mecanisme de

‘ «compromis» ou «arrangements» a see articles 49 et 123.107, qui visait a

‘ protéger les actionnaires par I’intervention du tribunal, ccntre des gestes poses

l par la compagnie qui ponaient attelnte a Ieurs droits tels qu'établis par les statuts

cu les reglements. A remarquer que ce mécanisme continuera de s'appliquer aux
compagnies d'assurance, aux sociétés de fiducie et aux sociétes d‘épargne
québécoise. Ii ne s'appliquera plus aux sociétés par actions.
19-254 Ce mécanisme, malgré Ie fail qu‘il portait un nom similaire a celui
de l‘uarrangement» de la loi fédérale, n'avait pas Ie meme objectif ni Ia meme
portée que ce demier qui, lui, vise a permet‘tre a la société de réaliser avec
l'autorisation du tribunal des operations qu'elle peut difficilement re’aliser («not
praticable»).
197255 L‘arrangement Qrévu aux articles 414 et suivants de la Loi sur les
socie’tés gar actions la «Loi» correspond dorénavant au mécanisme du modele
fédéral et donc les commentaires ci-devant relatives sic a ce me’canisme
s‘apgliguent ici auguel deux améliorations notables ont été aggortées: '
- elimination du «test comptablen'
- possibilité expressément grévue da transiger sur la det‘te ou sur les options
de la société»
[---l
19-261 Lapgert gue les tribunaux guébécois auront un role plus actit et
exigeant a 'ouer par rapport aux arrangements en vertu de la loi fédérale: ils ne
gourront en effet gas comgter comme sous la models fédéral sur un «tamisage
administratit» gréliminaire des arrangements gui leur sont scumis ni sur une
série de lignes directrices établies gar voie de Politigue administrative fixant des
balises préclses a ces arrangements. C'est a eux travaillant sans tilet

[underlined added]
[9] Accordingly, it is the Court's View that it would be unwise to conclude, as a
general principle, that the case law under CBCA should be applied mutadis mutandis to
the QBCA‘s provisions concerning an arrangement.

, [10] However, it is appropriate to say that the case law under CBCA remains highly
signiﬁcant and that it may be used to develop some applicable guidelines and
principles, albeit in accordance with the provisions of the QBCA and other laws of the '
Province of Quebec. ‘

i AQg/icab/e criteria for the issuance of an Interim Order ‘
i ,
i [i 1] As is the case under the CBCA provisions, the procedure of arrangement in the
QBCA requires three steps in order to obtain Court approval of the arrangement
submitted:
1. A first appearance in Court, where the applicant corporation seeks an interim
, order, ex parte, providing advice and direction in connection with the approval of
the Arrangement Resolution,
2. The corporation meeting, where the Securityholders entitled to vote are invited to
vote,
3, A second appearance in Court, where the applicant corporation seeks a final 1
order from the Court approving the arrangement ‘
[12] As stated above, ECU stands at the first step of the procedure. it seeks an i
Interim Order providing advice and direction pursuant to Section 416 of the QBCA,
which states:
«415. Before ruling on an application for approval. the court may, it the i
corporation so requests, subject the arrangement to a procedure that is different
from that provided by law for the action or actions included in the arrangement;
the court is not bound by any procedure proposed by the corporation. ‘
The court may also, before ruling on the application for approval, make any order
it thinks fit in order, among other things. to protect the rights of interested
persons, including
(1) an order determining the notice to be given to those persons or dispensing
with notice to any person;
(2) an order appointing an advocate, at the Corporation's expense, to defend the
rights of those persons;
(3) an order requiring the corporation to call a meeting of those persons in the ‘
manner the court directs;
(4) an order directing the arrangement proposed be submitted to those persons
I for authorization, in the manner directed by the court, in particular as regards the
vote required for that purpose; and ‘
(5) an order aliowing the exercise by those persons of the right to demand the i
repurchase of their shares, on the terms determined by the court.

1 [13] At this point, the applicant [ECU] must demonstrate that it furtills the following ‘
statutory requirements:
‘ 1. The proposed Arrangement constitutes an arrangement pursuant to Section
415 of the QBCA. l

2, It is not an insolvent corporation (As required in Section 414 part QBCA).

3. There is no adequate legal provision to implement the arrangement or it so, it
is impracticable or too onerous in the circumstances (As required in Section
414 par. 1 QBCA).

4. In cases where the arrangement concerns a corporation governed by one of
the Acts listed in the Act respecting the Autorite‘ des marches ﬁnanciers, the
application has been notified to the Autorité des marches financiers (As
required in Section 414 par. QBCA).

[14] in all cases, the court must keep in mind that such application is simply «to set
the wheels in motion for the application process relating to the arrangement and to
establish the parameters for the holding of shareholder meeting to consider approval of
the arrangement in accordance with the statute»?
[15] in other words, when the applicant fulfills the primary statutory requirements, the
Interim Order should be allowed since no Securityholders are prejudiced by the
issuance of such an interim order. They will have, as it is the case under the CBCA
provisions, the opportunity to appear in Court to apply for reliete,
The Interim Order sought by ECU
[16] At this time, the Court is satisfied that ECU meets all these statutory
requirements.
[17] Firstly, it is clear that the proposed Arrangement, which involves an exchange of
participation (stocks, warrants and options) and an exchange of convertible notes
constitutes an arrangement pursuant to Section 415 (5) BOA.
[18] Secondly, it is also clear that ECU, which is listed on the TSX under the Symbols
“ECU” and “ECU.WT”, with a market capitalization of approximately CDN $332.9 million ‘
as of June 23, 2011, is not an insolvent corporation. As indicated by the ECU‘s audited
. consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 20107, ECU had total assets of
t ap roximatel $86.7 million and total liabilities of approximately $27 million. Moreover.

t the consolidated interim balance sheet as at March 31, 20115 shows that ECU had total 3
‘ assets of approximately $74.5 million and total liabilities of approximately $26.7 million. ‘

l

[19] Thirdly, the Court is satisfied that the legal provisions of the QBCA, althoughthey 

permit the exchange of options and warrants, do not indicate how to implement such an ‘

exchange. l

[20] Finally. as a corporation governed by one of the Acts listed in Schedule 1 to the I

Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers, ECU fulfilled the requirement of

Section 414 (2) QBCA in notifying the application to the AMFQ.

Should an agglication for an interim Order proceed ex parte?

[21] This question was raised at the hearing.

[22] ECU‘s counsels submit that there is a long and consistent line of jurisprudence

under the CBCA providing that an applicant may proceed ex parte to obtain an interim

order“).

[23] This statement appears obvious.

[24] However, in the Court's view, there is no need to refer to case law under CBCA

since Section 4t4 QBCA requires only that such application be notified to the Autorite

des marches financiers «AMF».

[25] Thus, ECU was well founded to request to proceed ex parte since AMF, after

being notified of the application, decided not to appear in Court to challenge it, or make

any representations".

Should ECU demonstrate at this star 9 its and faith

[26] In virtue of the Code civil, the good faith is always presumed, unless the law

expressly requires that it be proved”.

[27] In the case of an arrangement under the OBCA's provisions, there are no

requirements to establish good faith, at least at this stage.

[28] Consequently, it is not a criteria that the Court has to consider.

CONCLUSION I
t [30] As the Arrangement constitutes an arrangement pursuant to Section 415 of the i
‘ QBCA, and that ECU is not an insolvent corporation, and that there is no adequate legal
provision to implement it, the interim order sought by ECU must be issued.

PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE RIGHT TO DEMAND REPURCHASE OF SHARES AT
CHAPTER XIV OF THE BUSINESS CORPORATIONS ACT (QUÉBEC)
APPENDIX G –
PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE RIGHT TO DEMAND REPURCHASE OF SHARES AT
CHAPTER XIV OF THE BUSINESS CORPORATIONS ACT (QUÉBEC)
CHAPTER XIV  
RIGHT TO DEMAND REPURCHASE OF SHARES 
 
DIVISION I  
GENERAL PROVISIONS 
 
§ 1. —  Conditions giving rise to right 
 
372. The  adoption  of  any  of  the  resolutions  listed  below  confers  on  a  shareholder  the  right  to  demand  that  the 
corporation repurchase all of the person's shares if the person exercised all the voting rights carried by those shares 
against the resolution: 
 
 (1) an ordinary resolution authorizing the corporation to carry out a squeeze-out transaction; 
 
 (2) a  special  resolution  authorizing  an  amendment  to  the  articles  to  add,  change  or  remove  a  restriction  on  the 
corporation's business activity or on the transfer of the corporation's shares; 
 
 (3) a  special  resolution  authorizing  an  alienation  of  corporation  property  if,  as  a  result  of  the  alienation,  the 
corporation is unable to retain a significant part of its business activity; 
 
 (4) a special resolution authorizing the corporation to permit the alienation of property of its subsidiary; 
 
 (5) a special resolution approving an amalgamation agreement; 
 
 (6) a  special resolution  authorizing  the  continuance  of  the  corporation  under  the  laws  of  a  jurisdiction  other  than 
Québec; or 
 
 (7) a resolution by which consent to the dissolution of the corporation is withdrawn if, as a result of the alienation of 
property begun during the liquidation of the corporation, the corporation is unable to retain a significant part of its 
business activity. 
 
The  adoption  of  a  resolution  referred  to  in  any  of  subparagraphs  3  to  7  of  the  first  paragraph  confers  on  a 
shareholder whose shares do not carry voting rights the right to demand that the corporation repurchase all of the 
person's shares. 
 
2009, c. 52, s. 372. 
 
373. The  adoption  of  a  special  resolution  described  in  section  191  confers  on  a  shareholder  holding  shares  of  the 
class or series specified in that section the right to demand that the corporation repurchase all of the person's shares 
of that class or series. That right is subject to the shareholder having exercised all the person's available voting rights 
against the adoption and approval of the special resolution. 
 
That right also exists if all the shares held by the shareholders are of the same class; in that case, the right is subject 
to  the  shareholder  having  exercised  all  of  the  person's  available  voting  rights  against  the  adoption  of  the  special 
resolution. 
 
2009, c. 52, s. 373; 2010, c. 40, s. 81. 
 
373.1. Despite section 93, non fully paid shares also confer the right to demand a repurchase. 
 
2010, c. 40, s. 82.
G-1
374. The  right  to  demand  a  repurchase  conferred  by  the  adoption  of  a  resolution  is  subject  to  the  corporation 
carrying out the action approved by the resolution. 
 
2009, c. 52, s. 374. 
 
375. A  notice  of  a  shareholders  meeting  at  which  a  special  resolution  that  could  confer  the  right  to  demand  a 
repurchase may be adopted must mention that fact. 
 
The  action  approved  by  the  resolution  is  not  invalidated  solely  because  of  the  absence  of  such  a  mention  in  the 
notice of meeting. 
 
Moreover, if the meeting is called to adopt a resolution described in section 191 or in any of subparagraphs 3 to 7 of 
the first paragraph of section 372, the corporation notifies the shareholders whose shares do not carry voting rights 
of the possible adoption of a resolution that could give rise to the right to demand a repurchase of shares. 
 
2009, c. 52, s. 375. 
 
§ 2. —  Conditions for exercise of right and terms of repurchase 
 
I. —  Prior notices 
 
376. Shareholders  intending  to  exercise  the  right  to  demand  the  repurchase  of  their  shares  must  so  inform  the 
corporation; otherwise, they are deemed to renounce their right, subject to Division II. 
 
To inform the corporation of the intention to exercise the right to demand the repurchase of shares, a shareholder 
must send a notice to the corporation before the shareholders meeting or advise the chair of the meeting during the 
meeting. In the case of a shareholder described in the second paragraph of section 372 none of whose shares carry 
voting rights, the notice must be sent to the corporation not later than 48 hours before the shareholders meeting. 
 
2009, c. 52, s. 376. 
 
377. As  soon  as  a  corporation  takes  the  action  approved  by  a  resolution  giving  rise  to  the  right  to  demand  a 
repurchase  of  shares,  it  must  give  notice  to  all  shareholders  who  informed  the  corporation  of  their  intention  to 
exercise that right. 
 
The  repurchase  notice  must  mention  the  repurchase  price  offered  by  the  corporation  for  the  shares  held  by  each 
shareholder and explain how the price was determined. 
 
If  the  corporation  is  unable  to  pay  the  full  redemption  price  offered  because  there  are  reasonable  grounds  for 
believing that it is or would be unable to pay its liabilities as they become due, the repurchase notice must mention 
that fact and indicate the maximum amount of the price offered the corporation will legally be able to pay. 
 
2009, c. 52, s. 377. 
 
378. The repurchase price is the fair value of the shares as of the close of the offices of the corporation on the day 
before the resolution conferring the right to demand a repurchase is adopted. 
 
When the action approved by the resolution is taken following a take-over bid with respect to all the shares of a class 
of shares issued by a corporation that is a reporting issuer and the bid is closed within 120 days before the resolution 
is adopted, the repurchase price may be determined to be the fair value of the shares on the day before the take-over 
bid closed if the offeror informed the shareholders, on making the take-over bid, that the action would be submitted 
to shareholder authorization or approval. 
 
2009, c. 52, s. 378.
G-2
379. The repurchase price of all shares of the same class or series must be the same, regardless of the shareholder 
holding them. 
 
However,  in  the  case  of  a  shareholder  holding  non-fully  paid  shares,  the  corporation  must  subtract  the  unpaid 
portion  of  the  shares  from  the  repurchase  price  offered  or,  if  it  cannot  pay  the  full  repurchase  price  offered,  the 
maximum amount that it can legally pay for those shares. 
 
The repurchase notice must mention the subtraction and show the amount that can be paid to the shareholder. 
 
2009, c. 52, s. 379; 2010, c. 40, s. 83. 
 
380. Within 30 days after receiving a repurchase notice, shareholders must confirm to the corporation that they wish 
to exercise their right to demand a repurchase. Otherwise, they are deemed to have renounced their right. 
 
The confirmation may not be limited to only part of the repurchasable shares. It does not affect a shareholder's right 
to demand an increase in the repurchase price offered. 
 
2009, c. 52, s. 380. 
 
II. —  Payment of repurchase price 
 
381. A  corporation  must  pay  the  offered  repurchase  price  to  all  shareholders  who  confirmed  their  decision  to 
exercise their right to demand the repurchase of their shares within 10 days after such confirmation. 
 
However, a corporation that is unable to pay the full repurchase price offered because there are reasonable grounds 
for  believing  that  it  is  or  would  be  unable  to  pay  its  liabilities  as  they  become  due  is  only  required  to  pay  the 
maximum  amount  it  may  legally  pay  the  shareholders.  In  that  case,  the  shareholders  remain  creditors  of  the 
corporation for the unpaid balance of the repurchase price and are entitled to be paid as soon as the corporation is 
legally able to do so or, in the event of the liquidation of the corporation, are entitled to be collocated after the other 
creditors but by preference over the other shareholders. 
 
2009, c. 52, s. 381. 
 
III. —  Increase in repurchase price 
 
382. To contest a corporation's appraisal of the fair value of their shares, shareholders must notify the corporation 
within the time given to confirm their decision to exercise their right to demand a repurchase. 
 
Such contestation is a confirmation of a shareholder's decision to exercise the right to demand a repurchase. 
 
2009, c. 52, s. 382. 
 
383. A corporation may increase the repurchase price offered within 30 days after receiving a notice of contestation. 
 
The  increase  in  the  repurchase  price  of  the  shares  of  the  same  class  or  series  must  be  the  same,  regardless  the 
shareholder holding them. 
 
2009, c. 52, s. 383. 
 
384. If a corporation does not follow  up on a shareholder's contestation  within 30 days  after receiving a notice of 
contestation, the shareholder may ask the court to determine the increase in the repurchase price. The same applies 
when a shareholder contests the increase in the repurchase price offered by the corporation. 
 
The shareholder must, however, make the application not less than 90 days after receiving the repurchase notice. 
 
2009, c. 52, s. 384.
G-3
385. As  soon  as  an  application  is  filed  under  section  384,  it  must  be  notified  by  the  corporation  to  all  the  other 
shareholders who are still contesting the appraisal of the fair value of their shares or the increase in the repurchase 
price offered by the corporation. 
 
2009, c. 52, s. 385. 
 
386. All shareholders to whom the corporation notified the application are bound by the court judgment. 
 
2009, c. 52, s. 386. 
 
387. The court may entrust the appraisal of the fair value of the shares to an expert. 
 
2009, c. 52, s. 387. 
 
388. The corporation must, without delay, pay the increase in the repurchase price to all shareholders who did not 
contest the increase offered. It must pay the increase determined by the court to all shareholders who, under section 
386, are bound by the court judgment, within 10 days after the judgment. 
 
However, a corporation that is unable to pay the full increase in the repurchase price because there are reasonable 
grounds for believing that it is or would be unable to pay its liabilities as they become due is only required to pay the 
maximum  amount  it  may  legally  pay  the  shareholders.  In  such  a  case,  the  shareholders  remain  creditors  of  the 
corporation for the unpaid balance of the repurchase price and are entitled to be paid as soon as the corporation is 
legally able to do so or, in the event of the liquidation of the corporation, are entitled to be collocated after the other 
creditors but by preference over the other shareholders. 
 
2009, c. 52, s. 388. 
 
DIVISION II  
SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOLLOWING FAILURE TO NOTIFY SHAREHOLDERS 
 
389. If  shareholders  were  unable  to  inform  the  corporation  of  their  intention  to  exercise  the  right  to  demand  the 
repurchase of their shares within the period prescribed by section 376 because the corporation failed to notify them 
of the possible adoption of a resolution giving rise to that demand, they may demand the repurchase of their shares 
as though they had informed the corporation and had voted against the resolution. 
 
Shareholders entitled to  vote  may  not exercise the right to  demand the repurchase of their shares if they  voted in 
favour of the resolution or were present at the meeting but abstained from voting on the resolution. 
 
A  shareholder  is  presumed  to  have  been  notified  of  the  proposed  adoption  of  the  resolution  if  notice  of  the 
shareholders meeting was sent to the address entered in the security register for that shareholder. 
 
2009, c. 52, s. 389. 
 
390. A  shareholder  must  demand  the  repurchase  of  shares  within  30  days  after  becoming  aware  that  the  action 
approved by the resolution conferring the right to demand a repurchase has been taken. 
 
However, the repurchase demand may not be made later than 90 days after that action is taken. 
 
2009, c. 52, s. 390. 
 
391. As soon as the corporation receives a repurchase demand, it must notify the shareholder of the repurchase price 
it is offering for the shareholder's shares.
G-4
The repurchase price offered for the shares of a class or series must be the same as that offered to shareholders, if 
any, who exercised their right to demand a repurchase after informing the corporation of their intention to do so in 
accordance with Division I. 
 
2009, c. 52, s. 391. 
 
392. The corporation  may  not pay the repurchase price offered to the shareholder if  such payment  would  make it 
unable to pay the maximum amount mentioned in the repurchase notice sent to the shareholders who informed the 
corporation, in accordance  with  section 376, of their intention to exercise their right to  demand the repurchase of 
their shares. 
 
If  the  corporation  cannot  pay  to  the  shareholder  the  full  amount  offered  to  the  shareholder,  the  directors  are 
solidarily liable for payment  to the  shareholder of the  sums needed to complete the payment of that amount. The 
directors are subrogated to the shareholder's rights against the corporation, up to the sums they have paid. 
 
2009, c. 52, s. 392. 
 
DIVISION III 
SPECIAL PROVISIONS WITH RESPECT TO BENEFICIARY 
 
393. A beneficiary who may give instructions to a shareholder as to the exercise of rights attaching to a share has the 
right to demand the repurchase of that share as though the beneficiary were a shareholder; however, the beneficiary 
may only exercise that right by giving instructions for that purpose to the shareholder. 
 
The beneficiary's instructions must allow the shareholder to exercise the right in accordance with this chapter. 
 
2009, c. 52, s. 393. 
 
394. A  shareholder  is  required  to  notify  the  beneficiary  of  the  calling  of  any  shareholders  meeting  at  which  a 
resolution that could give rise to the right to demand a repurchase may be adopted, specifying that the beneficiary 
may exercise that right as though the beneficiary were a shareholder. 
 
The shareholder is presumed  to have  fulfilled that obligation if the beneficiary is  notified in accordance  with any 
applicable regulations under the Securities Act (chapter V-1.1). 
 
2009, c. 52, s. 394. 
 
395. A  shareholder  must  inform  the  corporation  of  the  identity  of  a  beneficiary  who  intends  to  demand  the 
repurchase of shares, and of the number of shares to be repurchased, within the period prescribed by section 376. 
 
2009, c. 52, s. 395. 
 
396. A shareholder who demands the repurchase of shares in accordance with the instructions of a beneficiary may 
demand the repurchase of part of the shares to which that right is attached. 
 
2009, c. 52, s. 396. 
 
397. The beneficiary's claim with respect to shares for which the full repurchase price could not be paid, as well as 
the other rights granted to a beneficiary under this chapter, may be exercised directly against the corporation. 
 
Likewise,  after  the  repurchase  price  has  been  fully  paid,  the  rights  granted  to  a  beneficiary  under  this  chapter 
regarding an increase in the repurchase price may be exercised directly against the corporation. 
 
2009, c. 52, s. 397.

Amendment of 
Certificate of

Under  the  QBCA,  an  amendment  to  the 
articles  of  incorporation  generally  requires 
approval  by  special  resolution  of  the  voting 
shares.  Specified  amendments  may  also 
require the approval of other classes of shares. 
If  the  amendment  is  of  a  nature  affecting  a 
particular class or series in a manner requiring 
a  separate  class  or  series  vote,  that  class  or 
series  is  entitled  to  vote  on  the  amendment 
whether or not it otherwise carries the right to 
vote.
Generally,  Delaware  law  provides  that  a

Delaware  law  provides  that  the  stockholders 
entitled  to  vote  have  the  power  to  adopt, 
amend  or  repeal  by-laws.  A  corporation  may 
also confer, in its certificate  of incorporation,

conduct that is in breach of fiduciary duties of

exercise  of  that  jurisdiction  does  not  depend 
on  a  finding  of  a  breach  of  those  legal  and

Director 
Qualifications
Removal of 
Directors
The  QBCA  does  not  have  any  director 
residency  requirement.  It  requires 
that  a 
corporation  that  is  a  "reporting  issuer"  have 
not  fewer  than  three  directors,  at  least  two  of 
whom  are  not  officers  or  employees  of  the 
corporation or its affiliates.
Delaware law does not have director residency 
requirements.  Delaware 
law  permits  a 
corporation  to  prescribe  qualifications  for 
directors  under  its  certificate  of  incorporation 
or  by-laws.  Golden  has  not  prescribed  such 
qualifications.
Under  the  QBCA,  unless  the  articles  of  a 
corporation  provide  for  cumulative  voting 
(which is not the case for ECU), shareholders 
of the corporation may, by ordinary resolution 
passed  at  a  special  meeting,  remove  any 
director or directors from office. If holders of a 
class  or  series  of  shares  have  the  exclusive
Delaware  law  generally  provides  that  any 
director  may  be  removed,  with  or  without 
cause, by the affirmative vote of a majority of

of  directors,  except

In  addition,  the  QBCA  allows  a  vacancy  on

classified board or cumulative voting.
Under  the  DGCL,  unless  otherwise  provided 
in  the  certificate  of  incorporation  or  by-laws, 
vacancies  and  newly  created  directorships 
may  be  filled  by  a  majority  of  the  directors 
then in office, although less than a quorum, or 
by  a  sole  remaining  director.  Whenever  the 
holders  of  any  class  or  series  of  stock  are

given,  or,  if  notice  is  waived,  at  the  close  of 
business on the day next preceding the day on 
which the meeting is held.
Additionally,  Delaware  law  provides  that,  for 
the  purposes  of  determining  the  stockholders 
entitled  to  consent  to  corporate  action  in 
writing  without  a  meeting,  the  board  of 
directors  may  fix a record date,  which record 
date must not precede the date upon which the 
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by 
the board of directors, and which date will not 
be  more  than  l0  days  after  the  date  upon 
which  the  resolution  fixing  the  record  date  is 
adopted by the board of directors. If no record 
date has been fixed by the hoard of directors, 
the  record  date  for  determining  stockholders 
entitled  to  consent  to  corporate  action  in 
writing  without  a  meeting,  when  no  prior 
action by the board of directors is required by 
law,  will  be  the  first  date  on  which  a  signed 
written  consent  setting  forth  the  action  taken 
or  proposed  to  be  taken  is  delivered  to  the 
corporation.  If  no  record  date  has  been  fixed 
by  the  board  of  directors  and  prior  action  by 
the  board  of  directors  is  required  by  law,  the 
record  date  for  determining  stockholders 
entitled  to  consent  to  corporate  action  in 
writing without a meeting will be at the close 
of business on the day on which the board of 
directors adopts the resolution taking the prior 
action.

the  proposing 
stockholder.  To  be  timely,  a  stockholder's 
notice must be delivered 90 to 120 days prior 
to the first anniversary of the preceding year's 
annual meeting. However, in the event that an 
annual  meeting  is  advanced  by  more  than  30 
days  or  delayed  by  more  than  60  days  from 
the  first  anniversary  of  the  preceding  year's 
annual  meeting,  notice  by  the  stockholder  to

fiduciary  obligations 
require the directors to act in accordance with 
the  so-called  duties  of  "due  care"  and

care  requires  that  the  directors  act  in  good 
faith, in an informed and deliberative  manner 
and  that  they  inform  themselves,  prior  to 
making  a  business  decision,  of  all  material 
information reasonably available to them. The

interests.

Limitations on 
Director Liability
The QBCA does not permit any limitation of a 
director's  liability  other  than  in  connection 
with the adoption of a unanimous shareholder 
agreement (which is not the case for ECU) that 
restricts certain powers of the directors.
Golden's  certificate  of  incorporation  provides 
that  directors  are  not  liable  to  Golden  or  its 
stockholders for monetary damages for breach 
of  fiduciary  duty,  except  to  the  extent  that 
exemption  from  liability  is  not  permitted 
under Delaware law.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA, COMBINED, CONDENSED
FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF THE COMBINED COMPANY
APPENDIX I –
UNAUDITED PRO FORMA, COMBINED, CONDENSED
FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF GOLDEN MINERALS COMPANY
The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information as of March 31,
2011, for the three-month period then ended and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 is
presented to show the results of operations of Golden Minerals as if the Transaction with ECU had
occurred as of January 1, 2010, and financial position as if the Transaction had occurred as of
March 31, 2011.
This unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information should be read in conjunction
with the selected historical financial information and related financial statements and accompanying
footnotes of ECU included in this Circular and the financial statements and accompanying notes of
Golden Minerals that are incorporated by reference into this Circular. You should not rely on the
unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information as an indication of the results of
operations or financial position that would have been achieved if the Transaction with ECU had taken
place on the dates indicated or an indication of the results of operations in the future.
The following Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Data consists of an
Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2011 for Golden Minerals
and ECU and Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income
for the three-months ended March 31, 2011 and for the year ended December 31, 2010 (collectively,
the ‘‘Pro Forma Statements’’). ECU’s historical financial statements were prepared in accordance with
Canadian GAAP at December 31, 2010 and in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (‘‘IFRS’’) at March 31, 2011. Both methods of preparation differ in certain respects from
U.S. GAAP. ECU Silver Mining’s historical financial statements were also reported in Canadian dollars.
ECU’s historical financial statements used in these Pro Forma Statements have been adjusted to
conform to U.S. GAAP and have been translated to U.S. dollars. ECU’s historical financial statements
were translated to U.S. dollars using period ending exchange rates of $0.995 and $0.972 for the
condensed consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2011, respectively and
average exchange rates of $1.030 and $0.986 for the condensed consolidated statements of operations
for the year ended December 31, 2010 and the three-months ended March 31, 2011, respectively. The
principal GAAP differences relate to: 1) the treatment of exploration and development costs and
2) revenues generated from saleable minerals during the development stage. Under Canadian GAAP
and IFRS, ECU has been capitalizing exploration and development costs incurred during the
development stage and offsetting those capitalized costs with revenue generated from saleable minerals.
Under U.S. GAAP, those exploration and development costs would have appeared as expenses on the
statement of operations and revenues generated during the development stage would have appeared as
other income, net of incremental and direct costs associated with the revenue, on the statement of
operations. The change to U.S. GAAP and U.S. dollars resulted in an increase in ECU’s reported net
losses of approximately $2.5 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 and in a decrease in
ECU Silver Mining’s reported net losses for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 of approximately
$1.3 million. Golden Mineral’s historical financial statements are prepared in accordance with
U.S. GAAP.
The Pro Forma Statements reflect the terms of the Transaction, which will be structured as a plan
of arrangement under the Qu´ebec Business Corporations Act, whereby each ECU share will be
exchanged for 0.05 Golden Minerals shares and $0.000394 in cash. Upon completion of the Transaction,
existing Golden Minerals shareholders and ECU shareholders will own approximately 49% and 51%,
respectively, of the outstanding common stock of the combined company.
I-1
Golden Mineral’s management believes that, on the basis set forth herein, the Pro Forma
Statements reflect a reasonable estimate of the Transaction based on currently available information.
Golden Minerals Company expects the Transaction to be accounted for as a business combination
which requires the allocation of the purchase price to be based upon the estimated fair value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed. The actual purchase price may differ based on fluctuations in the price
of Golden Mineral’s common stock. See Note (1) in the unaudited pro forma financial statements for
sensitivity analysis on the impact of fluctuations in the price of Golden Mineral’s common stock and
the purchase price.

Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (Continued)
For The Quarter Ended March 31, 2011
The following adjustments have been reflected in the Unaudited Combined Pro Forma Statements:
(1) To record the issuance of 16,004,067 shares of Golden Minerals common stock and
$0.1 million of cash as purchase consideration for the Transaction based on an assumed
March 31, 2011 closing. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price based on the
estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is as follows:
Calculation of purchase price ($000’s):
Cash consideration . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Stock consideration(a) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Replacement stock options(b)
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Replacement warrants(b) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Total purchase price . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

(a) The value of Golden Minerals common stock used in these pro forma calculations is
$15.65, the closing price on July 27, 2011. The actual value of Golden Mineral’s common
stock will not be known until the Effective Date and may differ materially based on
changes in share price through the Effective Date. A 10% increase in the value of
Golden Mineral’s common stock would result in an increase in the purchase price of
approximately $25.0 million while a 10% reduction in the value of Golden Mineral’s
common stock would result in a decrease in the purchase price of approximately
$25.0 million.
(b) Certain of ECU’s outstanding stock options and warrants will be replaced with Golden
Minerals stock options and warrants at quantities and at strike prices based on the
Arrangement’s ratio if 0.05 Golden Minerals shares for each ECU share. These options
and warrants were obligations of ECU prior to the Transaction and are therefore
considered a portion of the purchase price. The fair value of these options and warrants
used in this calculation were determined using a Black-Scholes pricing model.
Preliminary allocation of purchase price ($000’s):
Current assets(c) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

(c) Monetary assets and liabilities assumed have been recorded at their carrying values, which
approximate fair value.
(d) Mineral properties are recorded at estimated fair market value based on the value of the
consideration given in the form of Golden Minerals common stock. The mineral
properties will not be amortized as they currently have no proven and probable reserves.

(e) Plant and equipment purchased in the Arrangement have been recorded at their carrying
values, which approximate fair value.
(2) To record a deferred tax liability related to the taxable effect of the stepped-up basis in
mineral properties recorded. The deferred tax liability was calculated by applying the Mexico
corporate tax rate of 28% to the stepped-up basis in the mineral properties recorded and is
net of a deferred tax asset of approximately $8.3 million resulting from the application of the
28% Mexico corporate tax rate to an estimated usable net operating loss carry-forward of
approximately $29.5 million.
(3) To eliminate ECU’s historical equity and non-monetary asset balances.
(4) The Pro Forma Combined Statement of Operations do not include estimated one-time
transaction costs totaling $16.0 million. Total transaction costs consist of estimated one-time
transaction costs of $5.0 million incurred by Golden Minerals and estimated one-time
transaction costs including severance benefits, bonuses, and other change of control payments
of $11.0 million incurred by ECU, a portion of which will be paid through the issuance of
$2.8 million of Golden Minerals shares. The transaction costs will be recorded once the
expenses have been incurred and may differ from the estimate.
(5) Upon completion of the Arrangement, existing Golden Minerals shareholders and ECU
shareholders will own approximately 49% and 51%, respectively, of the outstanding common
stock of the combined company. The transaction constitutes a change in control under the
terms of Golden Mineral’s 2009 Equity Incentive Plan and triggers the vesting of certain
previously unvested stock grants to Golden Minerals officers and employees. The accelerated
vesting of these stock grants would have resulted in the recognition of approximately
$2.9 million of stock based compensation expense. This direct incremental cost is not included
in the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Statement of Operations but will be recorded to
expense when the Arrangement with ECU is closed and may differ from the estimated
amount herein.

ECU SILVER MINING INC.
(A Development Stage Company)
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010
(unaudited, expressed in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted)
1. NATURE OF ACTIVITIES
ECU  Silver  Mining  Inc.  was  incorporated  in  the  province  of  Quebec,  Canada  and  its  shares  are  publicly  traded.  The  Company’s
registered office is 1116 Avenue Granada, Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec, Canada and its executive office is located at 87 Front Street East,
2nd Floor, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of mining properties in Mexico that
are mainly gold-bearing and silver-bearing. The Company has earned revenues from its exploration and development activities and is
considered  to  be  in  the  development  stage.  It  has  not  yet  determined  whether  a  sufficient  proportion  of  its  mineral  resources  are
economically exploitable and, accordingly, has not yet determined whether the mining properties contain economic mineral reserves.
These  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on  a  going  concern  basis,  which  assumes  that  the  Company  will,  in  the
ordinary course of business, be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities. The recoverability of the accumulated costs shown
for mining properties and related deferred costs is dependent upon the existence of economically recoverable reserves, future profitable
production, and on the Company’s ability to obtain the necessary financing to fund it’s operations.
2. BASIS OF PREPARATION
a) Statement of Compliance
The  unaudited  consolidated  interim  financial  statements  (‘‘interim  financial  statements’’)  of  ECU  Silver  Mining  Inc.  and  all  its
subsidiaries (together referred to as ‘‘ECU’’ or the ‘‘Company’’) for the first quarter ended March 31, 2011 have been prepared in
accordance with IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting. These are the Company’s first International Financial Reporting Standards
(‘‘IFRS’’) consolidated interim financial statements for part of the period covered by the first IFRS annual financial statements,
and  IFRS  1,  First-time  Adoption  of  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards,  has  been  applied.  The  consolidated  interim
financial statements do not include all of the information required for full annual consolidated financial statements. Accordingly
certain information and disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS, as issued
by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘‘IASB’’), have been omitted or condensed.
The significant accounting policies applied in these consolidated interim financial statements are presented in note 3 and are based
on IFRS in effect as of June 13, 2011. Any changes to IFRS that will impact the annual consolidated financial statements for the
year ending December 31, 2011 could result in a restatement of these consolidated interim financial statements.
An explanation of how the transition to IFRS has affected the reported financial position, financial performance and cash flows of
the Company is provided in note 23. This note includes reconciliations of equity, net earnings and total comprehensive income for
the  2010  comparative  periods,  and  of  equity  at  the  date  of  transition  reported  under  previous  Canadian  generally  accepted
accounting principles to those reported under IFRS for those periods and at the date of transition.
b) Basis of Measurement
The consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following, which are
measured at fair value:
• derivative financial instruments
• financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss
• available-for-sale assets
The methods used to measure fair values are discussed further in note 3 1.
c) Basis of Consolidation
Subsidiaries related to significant properties of the Company are accounted for as follows:

BLM Minera Mexicana S.A de C.V.
Minera William S.A de C.V.
Minera Labri S.A.de C.V.

2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (Continued)
The consolidated financial statements also included the Company’s share of the income, expenses, assets and liabilities of the San Diego
Joint Venture which involves jointly controlled exploration assets.
All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated.
3.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a) Presentation currency
The consolidated interim financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars which is the functional currency of ECU Silver
Mining  Inc.  The  functional  currency  of  the  Mexican  subsidiaries  is  the  Mexican  peso.  These  consolidated  interim  financial
statements have been translated to the Canadian dollar in accordance with IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange
Rates. These guidelines require that assets and liabilities be translated using the exchange rate at period end, and income, expenses
and  cash  flow  items  are  translated  using  the  rate  that  approximates  the  exchange  rates  at  the  dates  of  the  transactions  (i.e.  the
average rate for the period). Subsequent to the adoption of IFRS, all resulting exchange differences are recorded in the foreign
currency translation reserve.
b) Foreign currency transactions
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the
transactions.  Foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  resulting  from  the  settlement  of  such  transactions  and  from  the  translation  at
reporting period exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in profit or
loss. Non-monetary assets are translated at historical exchange rates.
c) Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Significant  accounts  that  require  estimates  as  the  basis  for  determining  the  stated  amounts  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  the
accounting  for  accounts  receivable  and  doubtful  accounts,  estimating  the  net  realizable  value  of  inventory,  asset  impairment,
accounting  for  share-based  payments,  revenue  recognition,  calculation  of  depreciation,  anticipated  costs  of  asset  retirement
obligations  and  the  valuation  of  deferred  income  tax  assets  and  liabilities,  mining  interests  and  deferred  expenditures.  While
management believes that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results could vary significantly.
In determining these estimates, the Company relies on assumptions regarding applicable industry performance and prospects, as
well as general business and economic conditions that prevail and are expected to prevail. These assumptions are limited by the
availability of reliable comparable data and the uncertainty of predictions concerning future events.
d) Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognized upon delivery when title and risk of ownership of metal and metal bearing concentrates passes to the buyer
and  when  collection  is  reasonably  assured.  The  contained  metal  in  the  concentrates  shipped  is  assayed  and  the  appropriate
negotiated amount of recoverable metal contained therein is recorded as revenue based on the then current market rate of the
metals.  The  concentrates  are  sold  under  contracts  that  provide  for  final  prices  to  be  determined  by  quoted  market  prices  in  a
period subsequent to the date of the sale. Variations from the provisionally priced sales are recognized as revenue adjustments in
the period they occur.
The  Company  has  continued  with  the  accounting  practice  under  Canadian  GAAP  that,  as  the  Company  is  in  the  development
stage, all revenues are offset against mining properties and deferred exploration costs.
e) Cash and cash equivalents
The Company’s policy is to present cash and temporary investments having a term of three months or less from the acquisition date
within cash and cash equivalents.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
f) Mining Properties, and Deferred Exploration and Development Expenses
The  amounts  recorded  as  mining  properties  and  deferred  exploration  costs  represent  exploration,  development  and  associated
operating  costs  incurred  to  date  and  are  not  intended  to  reflect  present  or  future  values.  These  costs  are  deferred  until  the
discovery of economically exploitable reserves and the start-up of the production phase on a property-by-property basis or until the
property  is  abandoned.  Mining  properties  are  abandoned  when  management  allows  property  interests  to  lapse  or  when  they
determine that properties are not economically viable. Costs accumulated relating to projects that are abandoned are written-off in
the year in which a decision to discontinue the project is made.
When it has been determined that a mining property can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable
reserves,  costs  incurred  prospectively  to  develop  the  property  are  capitalized  as  incurred  and  are  amortized  using  the
units-of-production method over the estimated life of the ore body based upon recoverable ounces to be mined from estimated
proven and probable reserves.
The  Company  is  in  the  development  stage  and  by  definition  commercial  production  has  not  yet  commenced.  Commercial
production  occurs  when  an  asset  or  property  is  substantially  complete,  is  fully  permitted  and  ready  for  its  intended  use.  No
amortization of mining properties has been charged in these financial statements.
Where there is an indication that impairment may exist, senior management reviews the carrying values of mining properties and
deferred exploration expenditures with a view to assessing whether there has been any impairment in value. In the event that it is
determined there is an impairment in the carrying value of any property, the carrying value will be written down or written off, as
appropriate. There was no impairment write-down required at March 31, 2011.
Supplies and spare parts are valued at the lower of average cost and replacement cost.
g) Property, Plant and Equipment
Property,  plant  and  equipment  are  carried  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  impairment  provisions.  Depreciation  is
provided  for  plant  and  equipment  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  estimated  useful  lives  of  the  related  assets  and  deferred  to
mining properties or charged to expense as appropriate. Depreciation is charged separately for each significant part of an item of
property, plant and equipment. The following estimated useful lives are being used:
Buildings
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Leasehold improvements
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Automotive . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Machinery and equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Computer equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Office equipment
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
20 years
2 or 8 years
4 years
10 years
31⁄3 years
10 years
The estimated useful lives, depreciation method and residuals are reviewed at each reporting date.
h) Asset retirement obligations
The Company records the present value of its legal obligations associated with the asset retirement when the liability is incurred.
The  corresponding  amount  is  capitalized  as  part  of  the  related  mining  property’s  carrying  value.  While  the  associated  mining
property is in the pre-production stage, the liability is accreted over time through periodic charges to mining property costs. In each
subsequent period, the carrying amounts of the asset and the liability are adjusted for changes to the Company’s estimate of future
cash flows associated with the retirement obligations.
Management estimates that the current present value of legal obligations for asset retirement is de minimis.
i)
Income and Mining Taxes
The  Company  uses  the  liability  method  to  account  for  income  taxes.  Under  this  method  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by using enacted or substantively
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years during which those temporary differences are expected to be

recovered or settled. Deferred tax asset is only recognized if it can be demonstrated that there will be taxable profits in future years
to utilize the deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses. The effect on future tax assets and liabilities of a change in
tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
j)
Basic and Diluted Loss per Share
The basic loss per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. We follow the
treasury  stock  method  in  calculating  diluted  earnings  per  share.  Under  this  method,  the  weighted  average  number  of  shares
includes  the  potentially  dilutive  effects  of  the  conversion  of  in-the-money  stock  options  and  warrants  into  common  shares.  The
effect  of  potential  issuances  of  shares  under  options  and  warrants  would  be  anti-dilutive  when  a  loss  is  reported,  and  therefore
basic and diluted losses per share are the same.
k) Stock-based compensation
Stock options granted to employees and non-employees are accounted for using the fair value method. Under this method, the
compensation cost is measured as at the date of the grant by applying the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The determined fair
value is recognized as a cost over the vesting period with a corresponding increase to contributed surplus. Those costs which relate
to employees engaged in exploration and development of mining properties, are capitalized to deferred mining property costs. On
the exercise of stock options, consideration paid and the associated contributed surplus amount is transferred to common shares.
l)
Financial Instruments
All financial assets are classified as either at fair value through profit or loss or amortized cost. Financial assets must be designated
as at fair value through profit or loss except for financial assets classified at amortized cost if the objective is to collect contractual
cash flows made up of principal and interest payments which are paid at a specified date. Cash and cash equivalents and accounts
receivable are designated as amortized cost. All financial liabilities are designated at amortized cost unless the Company on initial
recognition has classified the liability at fair value. All financial derivatives including embedded derivatives are classified as at fair
value  through  profit  or  loss  unless  the  financial  derivative  meets  the  criteria  of  an  equity  instrument.  All  financial  assets  and
liabilities designated as amortized cost use the effective interest method. Impairment provisions are made if and only if there is
objective evidence that the financial asset is impaired.
Transaction costs such as arrangement and advance fees charged by the Company’s principal lender in connection with long term
debt are expensed at the time they are incurred.
Fair value hierarchy:
Financial instruments recorded at fair value are classified using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs
used in making the measurements. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:
Level 1 reflects valuation based on quoted prices observed in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 reflects valuation techniques based on inputs that are quoted prices of similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices
for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices used in a valuation model that
are  observable  for  that  instrument;  and  inputs  that  are  derived  principally  from  or  corroborated  by  observable  market  data  by
correlation or other means.
Level 3 reflects valuation techniques with significant unobservable market inputs.
A  financial  instrument  is  classified  to  the  lowest  level  of  the  hierarchy  for  which  a  significant  input  has  been  considered  in
measuring fair value. The financial instruments in the Company’s financial statements, measured at fair value, are the cash and
cash equivalents.
m) Financial derivatives — warrants
A financial derivative such as a warrant which will be settled with the Company’s own equity instruments will be designated as an
equity  instrument  if  the  derivative  has  no  contractual  obligation  and  is  to  acquire  a  fixed  number  of  the  entity’s  own  equity
instruments for a fixed amount of Canadian dollars. A warrant will be considered as a financial liability at fair value through profit

or loss if it is to acquire either a variable number of equity instruments or consideration. However, if the warrant is for a fixed
number of equity instruments but the exercise is in a currency other than the functional currency the warrant will be a financial
liability unless the warrants were offered pro rata to all of its existing owners of the same class of its own non-derivative equity
instruments.
n) Financial derivatives — embedded derivatives
Certain derivatives embedded in other financial instruments are treated as separate derivatives when their economic characteristics
and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair value through profit or loss.
These embedded derivatives are separately accounted for at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss.
o)
Impairment of non-financial assets
The  Company’s  non-financial  assets  include  mining  properties  and  property,  plant  and  equipment.  The  assets  are  reviewed  for
impairment  on  an  annual  basis  or  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  may  not  be
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Where an individual asset cannot be
assessed  for  impairment,  assets  are  grouped  at  the  lowest  levels  for  which  there  are  separately  identifiable  cash  flows
(cash-generating units). Non-financial assets that suffered an impairment loss are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment
at each reporting date and any reversals are recognized in profit or loss.
4. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Certain pronouncements have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘‘IASB’’) or the International Financial
Reporting  Interpretation  Committee  (‘‘IFRIC’’)  that  are  mandatory  for  accounting  periods  after  December  31,  2010.  Many  are  not
applicable or do not have a significant impact to the Corporation and have been excluded from the discussion below.
a) New standards, amendments and interpretations issued effective for the financial year beginning January 1, 2011
Revised IAS 24 (revised), ‘Related party disclosures’, was issued in November 2009 and supersedes IAS 24, ‘Related party disclosures’,
issued  in  2003.  IAS  24  (revised)  is  mandatory  for  periods  beginning  on  or  after  1  January  2011.  The  revised  standard  clarifies  and
simplifies the definition of a related party.
Classification  of  rights  issues’  (amendment  to  IAS  32),  issued  in  October  2009.  The  amendment  addresses  the  accounting  for  rights
issues,  warrants  and  options  that  are  denominated  in  a  currency  other  than  the  functional  currency  of  the  issuer.  Provided  certain
conditions are met, such rights issues are now classified as equity regardless of the currency in which the exercise price is denominated.
The Company will apply the amended standard from January 1, 2011 where applicable. It is not expected to have any impact on the
Company’s financial statements.
IFRIC 19, ‘Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments’, effective July 1, 2010. The interpretation clarifies the accounting
by an entity when the terms of a financial liability are renegotiated and result in the entity issuing equity instruments to a creditor of the
entity to extinguish all or part of the financial liability (debt for equity swap). It requires a gain or loss to be recognised in profit or loss,
which is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability and the fair value of the equity instruments
issued. It is not expected to have any impact on the Company’s financial statements.
b) New standards, amendments and interpretations issued effective for the financial year beginning January 1, 2013 but early adopted by the
Company
IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, issued in November 2009 and amended in October 2010. This standard is the first step in the process to
replace  IAS  39,  ‘Financial  instruments:  recognition  and  measurement’.  IFRS  9  introduces  new  requirements  for  classifying  and
measuring  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities.  The  standard  is  not  applicable  until  January  1,  2013  but  the  Company  is  early
adopting as the profile of the Company’s financial assets and financial liabilities would be more appropriately classified under IFRS 9
rather than IAS 39.

The Company previously entered into contracts which terminated the legal actions related to title of four mineral concessions on the
Velarde˜na property and settled the title matter. Under the terms of the contracts, the Company agreed to pay a total of $6,000,000 US
dollars  in  a  series  of  6  payments  of  $1,000,000  US  dollars,  commencing  May  19,  2009  and  running  semi-annually  thereafter  ending
November 17, 2011, without interest. Under the terms of the contracts, a 30% interest in the title to the concessions will transfer to the
counterparty should the Company fail to make the payments agreed there under.
The fair value of the debt at initial recognition was estimated using the discounted cash flow method. The debt is being accreted over
the expected life of 21⁄2 years using the effective interest method at a rate of 15.5%.
Facilities loan
This  loan  carries  interest  at  10%  and  is  repayable  over  a  5  year  term  in  monthly  payments  of  principal  and  interest  of  $1,698  and
matures February 2013.

10. SHARE CAPITAL
The Company’s authorized share capital consists of an unlimited number of common shares without par value
In  2009,  the  Company  completed  an  offering  of  16,946,000  special  warrants  (the  ‘‘Special  Warrants’’)  to  subscribers  on  a  private
placement  basis  at  a  price  of  $0.72  per  Special  Warrant  for  a  total  gross  proceeds  of  $12,201,120.  The  net  proceeds  of  the  issue  of
$10,801,114 were reflected in a separate category in Shareholders’ Equity at January 1, 2010.
Effective January 27, 2010, following receipt of a short form prospectus filing, all the outstanding Special Warrants were deemed to be
exercised, resulting in the issuance of 16,946,000 units (the ‘‘Unit’’). Each Unit was comprised of one common share in the share capital
of the Company and one-half of one warrant to purchase a common share in the share capital of the Company (each whole warrant, a
‘‘Purchase  Warrant’’).  Each  Purchase  Warrant  entitles  the  holder  thereof  to  purchase  one  common  share  in  the  share  capital  of  the
Company at an exercise price of $0.90 per Purchase Warrant at any time before December 9, 2011. The gross proceeds of the Special
Warrant offering were assigned on deemed conversion $10,421,790 to common shares and $1,779,330 to warrants. The fair value of the
warrants  was  estimated  on  the  date  of  the  private  placement  based  on  the  Black-Scholes  option  pricing  model  using  the  following
assumptions: risk-free interest rate 1.0%, expected life 2 years, expected volatility 65%, and expected dividend yield 0%. The costs of
the private placement issue have been reflected as share issuance costs.
11. STOCK OPTIONS
Under the terms of the Company’s stock option plan (the ‘‘Plan’’) 14,252,398 Common Shares have been reserved for issuance. Options
under  the  Plan  are  permitted  to  be  granted  to  directors,  officers,  employees  and  consultants  of  the  Company,  provided  that  the
maximum  number  of  Common  Shares  which  may  be  reserved  for  issuance  to  any  one  beneficiary  in  any  12  month  period  may  not
exceed 5% of the number of Common Shares then issued and outstanding or 2% in the case of a beneficiary who is conducting investor
relations  activities.  The  exercise  price  of  options  granted  under  the  Plan  is  not  permitted  to  be  less  than  the  closing  price  of  the
Common Shares on the day preceding the grant of the options, less any discount allowed by applicable securities legislation. Options

Option pricing models including the Black-Scholes model require the input of highly subjective assumptions that can materially affect
the fair value estimate and therefore do not necessarily provide a reliable measure of the fair value of the Company’s stock options.

14. CONTINGENCIES
Intangible Asset
In January 2005, the Company acquired the rights to use a technology which is expected to increase material recuperation of current
and future Mexican projects. At the time the agreement was reached the Company issued 500,000 common shares and the Company is
bound  to  issue  an  additional  500,000  common  shares  should  it  choose  to  use  the  technology  at  a  commercial  scale.  In  addition,  the
agreement  provides  that  the  Company  pay  royalties  of  1.5%  of  all  production  resulting  from  the  application  of  the  technology  in
Mexican properties. The technology was not employed in the current period.

16. MANAGEMENT OF CAPITAL
The  Company’s  objectives  in  managing  its  capital  resources  are  to  ensure  the  entity’s  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern.  The
Company satisfies its capital requirements through careful management of its cash resources and by utilizing credit facilities or issuing
equity, as necessary, based on the prevalent economic conditions of both the industry and the capital markets and the underlying risks
characteristics of the related assets.
As  at  March  31,  2011,  the  Company  had  long-term  debt  of  $16,618,541  US  dollars.  In  January  2011,  the  Company  restructured  the
facility  with  its  lender.  Principal  repayments  under  the  amended  facility  are  payable  in  thirty  equal  monthly  payments  commencing
July 31, 2011 and ending December 31, 2013.
The Company is also obligated to semi-annual payments of $1,000,000 US dollars due under terms of a mineral concession agreement.
The two final payments are due May 17, 2011 and November 17, 2011
Based on current plans and estimates management believes that its operations can be funded through working capital, potential future
credit facilities, and cash flow expected to be generated from the sale of products from its operations. As discussed note 1, the Company
is dependent on its ability to raise the necessary capital to fund its operations and management can not provide assurance that it will
ultimately be able to complete the required funding transactions. Furthermore, since we do not have proven and probable reserves we
can not predict with confidence the level of cash flows that will be generated from the milling operations. As such, we may need to
either restructure our long term debt so that repayment requirements match the cash generation capability or raise additional equity in
the alternate. Management can provide no guarantee that the Company will be successful in these transactions should they be required.
The Company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements and there has been no change with respect to the overall
capital risk management strategy during the period.

The fair value of all financial assets approximate their carrying values due to their short-term maturity. For financial liabilities, except in
the case of long-term debt, the fair value approximates the carrying amount because the market rate of interest is paid. There are no
outstanding financial instruments measured at fair value and accordingly no disclosure of the fair value hierarchy.

ECU’s share in the joint venture with Golden Tag Resources Ltd (‘‘Golden Tag’’) is 50% of the mining property costs incurred following
the $1,500,000 US dollars earn in by Golden Tag as well as a 50% interest in the rights of the San Diego property.
19. LOSS CARRY FORWARDS
These  financial  statements  do  not  recognize  a  deferred  tax  asset  for  tax  loss  carry  forwards  as  it  cannot  be  demonstrated  that  the
Company will have taxable profits in the future with which to offset these losses. The Company will review at each reporting date the
unrecognized deferred tax asset to determine whether an asset should be recognized based upon the circumstances at that time.
At December 31, 2010, the Company had non-capital loss carry forwards, available to offset future taxable income for Canadian tax
purposes, aggregating $10,209,887 which expire over the period between 2014 and 2030.
At  December  31,  2010,  the  Company  had  tax  loss  carry  forwards,  available  to  offset  future  taxable  income  in  Mexico,  aggregating
$39,566,687 which expire between 2011 and 2020.
20. INCOME TAX EXPENSE
There is no current income tax expense or provision for deferred tax as a result of tax losses and because of recent operating losses the
Company cannot demonstrate future taxable profits meaning a deferred tax asset on tax losses carried forward cannot be recognized.
21. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Key management personnel includes the members of the management team who directly report to the chief executive officer

23. TRANSITION TO IFRS
For all periods up to and including the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company prepared its financial statements in accordance
with  Canadian  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (‘‘CGAAP’’).  The  financial  statements  for  the  three  months  period  ended
March 31, 2011 are the first the Company has prepared in accordance with IFRS.
In preparing these financial statements, the opening statement of financial position was prepared as at January 1, 2010, the Company’s
date of transition to IFRS. This note explains the principal adjustments made in restating the previous CGAAP statement of financial
position as at January 1, 2010 and its previously published GAAP financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2010.
Exemptions applied
IFRS 1 ‘First-Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’ allows first-time adopters certain exemptions from the
retrospective application of IFRSs. The Company has elected the following exemptions:
(a) IFRS 2 Share-based Payment has not been applied to the options issued under the Stock Option Plans that were vested prior to
January 1, 2010.
(b) designation of previously recognized financial instruments under IFRS 9 based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at the
transition date.
(c) The  Company  has  elected  to  apply  IFRS  3  prospectively  to  business  combinations  occurring  after  its  transition  date.  Business
combinations occurring prior to the transition date have not been restated.
(d) Accumulated translation differences at January 1, 2010 are shown as zero with the balance transferred to accumulated deficit.
The  exceptions  under  IFRS  1  not  to  retrospectively  apply  certain  IFRS  at  the  transition  date  have  been  applied.  The  Company’s
estimates in accordance with IFRS are consistent with estimates made in accordance with previous GAAP (after adjustments to reflect
any difference in accounting policies).
Reconciliations
The reconciliations between the previously reported financial results under CGAAP and the current reported financial results under
IFRS are provided as follows:
• reconciliation of equity at January 1, 2010
• reconciliation of equity at December 31, 2010
• reconciliation of total comprehensive income for the three months ended March 31, 2010
No reconciliation is required for the consolidated cash flow statement as there are no significant differences.

Explanation for reconciling items
Under CGAAP the Company used the temporal method in translating foreign operations and non-monetary assets and liabilities in
foreign currency to the presentation currency. This adjustment is primarily the impact of translating mining property costs and property
plant  and  equipment  at  the  closing  rates  on  consolidation  rather  than  the  historic  rates  and  removing  exchange  differences  on  the
consolidation of foreign operations from profit or loss and including in equity.
The method of calculating the fair value under IFRS 2 for stock based compensation plans is different than CGAAP due to grading and
allowing an assumption for a forfeiture. This adjustment is the impact of this difference.
24. APPROVAL OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The consolidated interim financial statements of ECU Silver Mining Inc. for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 were
approved and authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on June 13, 2011.
These consolidated interim financial statements have been amended to include note 25 which presents the material differences between

ECU SILVER MINING INC.
(A Development Stage Company)
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010
(unaudited, expressed in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted)
Notes to consolidated United States GAAP adjustments:
a. Mining property costs
Under IFRS, exploration and evaluation expenditures on identifiable properties are capitalized. Costs of acquiring mineral properties and
related evaluation expenditures during the exploration and evaluation stages include those costs related to the search for mineral resources,
the determination of technical feasibility and the assessment of commercial viability of an identified resource. United States GAAP requires
that all exploration costs be expensed.
b. Mining property costs classification in other income
Under IFRS, net revenue or expense derived from a mineral property prior to the production phase of a mine is capitalized and included in
the cost of the asset. A United States GAAP adjustment arises because United States GAAP requires that all exploration related costs and
associated revenues be expensed. Furthermore, United States GAAP requires that any incremental and direct costs associated with the sale
of excavated saleable minerals during the development phase of the mine and prior to the production phase of the mine be classified as
Other income and offset by the related amounts of proceeds from the sale of these minerals. Incremental and direct costs are those costs
that would otherwise have not been incurred if not for the sale of these minerals.
Stock-based compensation and stock options
c.
Under IFRS, stock-based compensation costs and stock option costs incurred during the exploration or development stage of the mineral
properties are capitalized prior to the establishment of proven or probable reserves in circumstances where they are directly related to the
exploration and evaluation of an underlying identifiable mineral property. United States GAAP requires that all stock-based compensation
costs and stock option costs be expensed.
d. Convertible debentures
The impact of the differences in treatment between Canadian GAAP and US GAAP of convertible debentures for the periods presented
affects solely the March 31, 2009 comparative period. Under Canadian GAAP, convertible debenture proceeds are allocated between their
debt and equity component parts based on the relative fair values of the debt component and the embedded conversion feature. The debt
component  is  accreted  to  the  face  value  of  the  debentures  with  the  resulting  interest  expense  charged  to  operations.  The  costs  of  the
financing are allocated on a proportional basis between the liability and equity portions based on their relative fair values with the liability
portion of the costs expensed and the equity portion treated as a reduction of the gross proceeds allocated to the equity component. United
States  GAAP  treats  the  convertible  debenture  solely  as  a  liability  since  the  embedded  conversion  feature  does  not  meet  US  GAAP
requirements for classification as an equity component. The liability is recorded at its full face value since the embedded conversion feature
has no intrinsic value on a stand-alone basis and accordingly does not meet the requirements of an equity component under United States
GAAP. United States GAAP requires that convertible debentures, net of issuance costs, be accreted to face value over the term ending on
the first put date of the debentures which, in this case, is the issuance date of the debentures since the debentures are convertible on demand
by the Unit holders. Thus, the debentures’ carrying value prior to conversion equalled their face value on the balance sheet.
Foreign currency translation reserve
e.
Under IFRS, the results and financial position of subsidiaries that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are
translated into the presentation currency as follows: assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the reporting date; income and
expenses for each income statement item are translated at average exchange rates for the period; and all resulting exchange differences are
recognized in other comprehensive income as foreign currency translation reserve. United States GAAP requires that certain non-monetary
assets and liabilities in foreign currencies be translated at historical rates such as mining property costs and property plant and equipment.
Therefore, for US GAAP purposes, mining property costs and property plant and equipment have been translated at their historical rates
such  that  the  IFRS  financial  statements  have  been  adjusted  to  reclassify  the  foreign  currency  translation  reserve  from  deficit  and  other
reserves to the underlying Balance Sheet items impacted.
Stock based compensation plans fair value
f.
Under  IFRS,  the  method  of  calculating  the  fair  value  of  stock  based  compensation  plans  includes  the  requirement  to  adjust  the
compensation  expense  for  estimates  of  non-market  vesting  conditions,  such  as  options  that  are  not  expected  to  vest  (i.e.  forfeitures).
Furthermore,  IFRS  grading  of  stock  based  compensation  for  purposes  of  the  determination  of  fair  value  is  based  on  each  tranche  in  an
award being considered a separate award with its own vesting period and grant date fair value. United States GAAP does not require any
initial estimation of non-market vesting conditions (i.e. forfeitures) and the method of calculating fair value does not require the grading of
each tranche in an award as a separate award. Therefore, for US GAAP purposes, the method of calculating the fair value for stock based
compensation plans differs due to the exclusion of the non-market vesting conditions (i.e. forfeitures) and the exclusion of the grading of
each tranche in an award as a separate award.

g. Mining property costs classification in statement of cash flow
United States GAAP requires that cash flows relating to mineral property exploration and land use costs be reported as operating activities.
However, under IFRS mineral property exploration and evaluation expenditures are classified as investing activities.
Other disclosures:
The  following  additional  information  would  be  presented  if  these  consolidated  financial  statements  were  presented  in  accordance  with
U.S. GAAP:
Auditor’s Report: Emphasis of matter paragraph
i.
In the United States, reporting standards for auditors require the addition of an explanatory paragraph (following the opinion paragraph)
when the financial statements are affected by conditions and events that cast substantial doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a
going  concern,  such  as  those  described  in  Note  1  to  these  interim  unaudited  consolidated  financial  statements.  IFRS  do  not  permit  a
reference  to  such  events  and  conditions  in  the  auditors’  report  when  these  are  adequately  disclosed  in  the  financial  statements.  The
Company draws attention to Note 1 to these financial statements, which describes certain conditions that give rise to substantial doubt about
the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. However, these financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of this uncertainty consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2010 whereby
the Auditor’s opinion was not qualified in respect of this matter.
Joint Venture
ii.
San  Diego  Joint  Venture  has  been  recorded  under  IFRS  on  a  proportionate  basis  whereas  under  United  States  GAAP,  investments  in
incorporated joint ventures should be accounted for using the equity method. However, the Company has elected to use the accommodation
of  the  SEC  whereby  the  accounting  for  joint  ventures  need  not  be  reconciled  from  IFRS  to  United  States  GAAP  since  the  different
accounting  treatment  affects  only  the  presentation  and  classification  of  financial  statement  items  and  not  net  income  or  shareholders’
equity..

Income tax uncertainty
v.
The  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  file  federal  income  tax  returns  in  Canada  and  Mexico;  the  Company’s  Mexican  subsidiaries  also  file
Mexican state tax returns where required by law. With few exceptions, the Company and its Mexican subsidiaries are subject to Canadian
federal or Mexican federal, state and local examinations by the tax authorities for a minimum of four years in arrearage to the extent that the
Company receives a notice of assessment from the respective competent authorities.
iv. Deferred income tax
IFRS financial statements do not take into account the tax benefit arising from loss carry forwards which are available to the Company to
reduce its income for tax purposes in future periods so that no deferred income tax has been recorded in these IFRS financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are not recognized for the tax benefit arising from loss carry forwards to the extent that it is not probable that taxable
profits will be available against which these loss carry forwards can be utilized in the future. The Company has disclosed its non-capital loss
carry  forwards  and  tax  loss  carry  forwards  as  at  December  31,  2010  in  Note  19,  ‘‘Loss  carry  forwards’’  to  these  interim  unaudited
consolidated financial statements. Therefore, consistent with the current IFRS accounting treatment, no deferred income tax consequences
have been recorded under United States GAAP relating to US GAAP adjustments recorded in the reconciliations forthwith.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management  is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  adequate  internal  control  over  financial
reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (United States)
and Canadian securities regulations, for ECU Silver Mining Inc. Internal control over financial reporting is a
process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.
Due  to  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect
misstatements on a timely basis. Also, projections of the effectiveness of internal control are subject to the risk
that  the  controls  may  become  inadequate  because  of  changes  in  conditions.  Therefore,  even  those  systems
determined  to  be  effective  can  provide  only  reasonable  assurance  with  respect  to  the  financial  statement
preparation and presentation.
Management carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31,  2010.  The  framework  on  which  such  evaluation  was  based  is  contained  in  the  report  entitled
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission  (COSO).  This  evaluation  included  review  of  the  documentation  of  controls,  evaluation  of  the
design  effectiveness  of  controls,  testing  of  the  operating  effectiveness  of  controls  and  a  conclusion  on  this
evaluation. Although there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control over
financial reporting, based on this evaluation, management has concluded that the system of internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010.
Guimond Lavall´ee Inc, our independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report
on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting at ECU Silver Mining Inc. as at December 31,
2010, which is presented hereinafter.

To the Shareholders of ECU Silver Mining Inc.,
Independent Auditor’s Report
We  have  completed  integrated  audits  of  ECU  Silver  Mining  Inc’s.  (the  Company)  2010  and  2009
consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.
Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.
Report on the consolidated financial statements
We  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  of  ECU  Silver  Mining Inc.,  which
comprise the consolidated balance sheets as at December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the consolidated statements of
loss,  comprehensive  loss  and  deficit  and  cash  flows  for  the  years  then  ended,  and  a  summary  of  significant
accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Management’s responsibility for the consolidated financial statements
Management  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  these  consolidated  financial
statements in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles and for such internal control
as  management  determines  necessary  to  enable  the  preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  that  are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards and the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform  an  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  whether  the  consolidated  financial  statements  are  free  of
material  misstatement.  Canadian  generally  accepted  auditing  standards  require  that  we  comply  with  ethical
requirements.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence, on a test basis, about the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment,
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to fraud or error. In making those risks assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the
Company’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of
accounting principles and policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained in our audits is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion, the amended consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of ECU Silver Mining Inc. as at December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the results of its operations
and  its  cash  flows  for  the  years  then  ended  in  accordance  with  Canadian  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.
Emphasis of Matter
Without  modifying  our  opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  the  years  ended  December 31,
2010 and 2009 have been amended as disclosed in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. Our report
dated  March 29,  2011  on  the  previously  issued  consolidated  financial  statements  for  the  years  ended
December 31, 2010 and 2009 has been amended, as such.

Report on internal control over financial reporting
We have also audited ECU Silver Mining Inc. internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2010,  based  on  the  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control—Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  of
Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission.
Management  is  responsible  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  its
assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  included  in  the  accompanying
Management’s report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
on  our  audit.  We  conducted  our  audit  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  in  accordance  with  the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  effective  internal  control  over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances.
We  believe  that  our  audit  provides  a  reasonable  basis  for  our  audit  opinion  on  the  Company’s  internal
control over financial reporting.
A Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  A  Company’s  internal  control  over  financial
reporting  includes  those  policies  and  procedures  that  (1) pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the  Company  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the
Company;  and  (3) provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized
acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of  the  company’s  assets  that  could  have  a  material  effect  on  the  financial
statements.
Because  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, ECU Silver Mining Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial  reporting  as  of  December 31,  2010,  based  on  the  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

ECU SILVER MINING INC.
(A Development Stage Company)
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009
(in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted)
1. NATURE OF ACTIVITIES
ECU Silver Mining Inc. (‘‘ECU’’, or the ‘‘Company’’) is engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of mining properties
in Mexico that are mainly gold-bearing and silver-bearing. The Company has earned revenues from its exploration and development
activities  and  is  considered  to  be  in  the  development  stage.  It  has  not  yet  determined  whether  a  sufficient  proportion  of  its  mineral
resources  are  economically  exploitable  and,  accordingly,  has  not  yet  determined  whether  the  mining  properties  contain  economic
mineral reserves.
These  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on  a  going  concern  basis,  which  assumes  that  the  Company  will,  in  the
ordinary course of business, be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities. The recoverability of the accumulated costs shown
for mining properties and related deferred costs is dependent upon the existence of economically recoverable reserves, future profitable
production, and on the Company’s ability to obtain the necessary financing to fund it’s operations.
2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles. The
significant accounting policies followed by the Company are summarized as follows:
a) Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and those of its subsidiaries, all owned by ECU, BLM
Minera  Mexicana  S.A  de  C.V.,  Minera  William  S.A  de  C.V.,  and  Minera  Labri  S.A.  de  C.V.,  and  on  a  proportionate  basis,  the
accounts of the San Diego Joint Venture. All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated.
b) Use of Estimates
The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  Canadian  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires
management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  amounts  reported  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and
notes to consolidated financial statements. Significant areas where management’s judgement has been applied include; the useful
life  of  capital  assets,  the  estimated  net  realizable  value  of  inventory,  asset  impairment,  stock-based  compensation,  and  future
income tax assets and liabilities. While management believes that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results
could vary significantly.
c) Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognized upon delivery when title and risk of ownership of metal and metal bearing concentrates passes to the buyer
and  when  collection  is  reasonably  assured.  The  contained  metal  in  the  concentrates  shipped  is  assayed  and  the  appropriate
negotiated amount of recoverable metal contained therein is recorded as revenue based on the then current market rate of the
metals.  The  concentrates  are  sold  under  contracts  that  provide  for  final  prices  to  be  determined  by  quoted  market  prices  in  a
period subsequent to the date of the sale. Variations from the provisionally priced sales are recognized as revenue adjustments in
the period they occur.
As the Company is in the development stage, all revenues are offset against mining properties and deferred exploration costs in
accordance with the recommendations of the section 3061 ‘‘Property, Plant and Equipment’’.
d) Foreign Exchange
The Canadian dollar is the functional currency of the Company. The Company uses the temporal method to translate its foreign
currency  transactions,  including  its  integrated  foreign  subsidiaries.  Monetary  assets  and  liabilities  are  translated  at  the  rate  of
exchange in effect at period-end. Other assets and liabilities are translated at their historic rates. Items appearing in the income
statement,  except  for  depreciation  translated  at  historic  rates,  are  translated  at  average  rates.  Exchange  gains  and  losses  are
included in the income statement.
e) Cash and cash equivalents
The Company’s policy is to present cash and temporary investments having a term of three months or less from the acquisition date
with cash and cash equivalents.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
f)
Inventory
Materials-in-process (concentrates) are valued at lower of average production cost and net realizable value.
g) Mining Properties, and Deferred Exploration and Development Expenses
The  amounts  recorded  as  mining  properties  and  deferred  exploration  costs  represent  exploration,  development  and  associated
operating  costs  incurred  to  date  and  are  not  intended  to  reflect  present  or  future  values.  These  costs  are  deferred  until  the
discovery of economically exploitable reserves and the start-up of the production phase on a property-by-property basis or until the
property  is  abandoned.  Mining  properties  are  abandoned  when  management  allows  property  interests  to  lapse  or  when  they
determine that properties are not economically viable. Costs accumulated relating to projects that are abandoned are written-off in
the year in which a decision to discontinue the project is made.
When it has been determined that a mining property can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable
reserves,  costs  incurred  prospectively  to  develop  the  property  are  capitalized  as  incurred  and  are  amortized  using  the
units-of-production method over the estimated life of the ore body based upon recoverable ounces to be mined from estimated
proven and probable reserves.
The  Company  is  in  the  development  stage  and  by  definition  commercial  production  has  not  yet  commenced.  Commercial
production  occurs  when  an  asset  or  property  is  substantially  complete,  is  fully  permitted  and  ready  for  its  intended  use.  No
amortization of mining properties has been charged in these financial statements.
Where there is an indication that impairment may exist, senior management reviews the carrying values of mining properties and
deferred exploration expenditures with a view to assessing whether there has been any impairment in value. In the event that it is
determined there is an impairment in the carrying value of any property, the carrying value will be written down or written off, as
appropriate. There was no impairment write-down required at December 31, 2010.
Supplies and spare parts are valued at the lower of average cost and replacement cost.
h) Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided for plant and equipment
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets and deferred to mining properties or charged to expense
as appropriate. The following estimated useful lives are being used:

i)
Asset retirement obligations
The Company records the present value of its legal obligations associated with the asset retirement when the liability is incurred.
The  corresponding  amount  is  capitalized  as  part  of  the  related  mining  property’s  carrying  value.  While  the  associated  mining
property is in the pre-production stage, the liability is accreted over time through periodic charges to mining property costs. In each
subsequent period, the carrying amounts of the asset and the liability are adjusted for changes to the Company‘s estimate of future
cash flows associated with the retirement obligations.
Management estimates that the current present value of legal obligations for asset retirement is de minimis.
j)
Income and Mining Taxes
The  Company  uses  the  liability  method  to  account  for  income  taxes.  Under  this  method  of  Section  3465,  future  tax  assets  and
liabilities  are  recognized  for  the  future  tax  consequences  attributable  to  differences  between  the  financial  statement  carrying
amounts  of  existing  assets  and  liabilities  and  their  respective  tax  bases.  Future  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  measured  by  using

enacted  or  substantively  enacted  tax  rates  expected  to  apply  to  taxable  income  in  the  years  during  which  those  temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under Section 3465, the effect on future tax assets and liabilities of a change in
tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
k) Basic and Diluted Loss per Share
The basic loss per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. We follow the
treasury  stock  method  in  calculating  diluted  earnings  per  share.  Under  this  method,  the  weighted  average  number  of  shares
includes  the  potentially  dilutive  effects  of  the  conversion  of  in-the-money  stock  options  and  warrants  into  common  shares.  The
effect  of  potential  issuances  of  shares  under  options  and  warrants  would  be  anti-dilutive  when  a  loss  is  reported,  and  therefore
basic and diluted losses per share are the same.
l)
Stock-based compensation
Stock options granted to employees and non-employees are accounted for using the fair value method. Under this method, the
compensation cost is measured as at the date of the grant by applying the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The determined fair
value is recognized as a cost over the vesting period with a corresponding increase to contributed surplus. Those costs which relate
to employees engaged in exploration and development of mining properties, are capitalized to deferred mining property costs. On
the exercise of stock options, consideration paid and the associated contributed surplus is credited to common shares.
m) Financial Instruments
All  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  are  classified  as  either:  held-for-trading,  available-for-sale,  held-to-maturity,
loans-and-receivables or other liabilities. Financial assets classified as held-for-trading or available-for-sale, are measured at fair
value.  Held-to-maturity,  and  loans-and-receivables  are  measured  initially  at  fair  value  then  at  amortized  cost  over  their  term.
Financial  liabilities  are  measured  at  their  fair  value  when  they  are  classified  as  held-for-trading  otherwise  they  are  measured  at
amortized cost over their term. Initial differences between fair value and maturity value are amortized using the effective interest
method.
Holding gains and losses from available-for-sale assets are included in other comprehensive income until realized at which time
they are transferred to net income (loss).
Transaction costs such as arrangement and advance fees charged by the Company’s principal lender in connection with long term
debt are expensed at the time they are incurred.
n) Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards
The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants has announced that publicly accountable enterprises will be required to adopt
International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (‘‘IFRS’’)  effective  January  1,  2011.  At  the  effective  date,  the  balance  sheet  as  at
January  1,  2010  will  require  conversion  to  IFRS  to  establish  opening  balances  which  will  form  the  basis  for  comparative
information to be reported in 2011. Accordingly, this is the last set of financial statements for the Company using pre-IFRS.

INVENTORY
The Company has reflected its gold pyrite material-in-process inventory at a net realizable value of zero. During the first quarter of
2010, this resulted in the Company recording a write-down of inventory of $141,938. During the third quarter, the Company entered
into a sales contract for a portion of its unprocessed gold pyrite concentrate inventory. In relation to the pyrite concentrate which was
shipped during the year under the sales contract, the Company has recorded a reversal of the costs previously written off amounting to
$2,045,613. This reversal has increased deferred mining costs with the offsetting amount recorded as a gain on reversal of inventory
write-down.

5. MINING PROPERTY COSTS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (Continued)
Deferred  costs  for  the  Velarde˜na  property  have  been  offset  by  the  related  revenues.  During  the  year  total  of  such  revenues  was
$19,345,686 ($6,577,167 — 2009). The cumulative amount of such revenues for the Velarde˜na property is $37,423,996 ($18,078,310 —
2009).
Chicago
The Chicago property is located approximately 2 km south of the Velarde˜na property. The property consists of 8 contiguous mineral
concessions totalling 315.88 hectares. The Company has full title to the claims. The Company was actively mining on the property and
processing the mined material at its mills situated near the town of Velarde˜na.
San Diego
The San Diego property is located 9 km northeast of ECU’s Velarde˜na property. It is comprised of 4 contiguous mineral concessions
totalling an area of 91.65 hectares and is being explored under the terms of a joint venture agreement in which the costs are shared
50/50 (See note 18). No exploration activity was undertaken in the period.
Nazas
The  Nazas  property  is  located  approximately  64  km  west  of  ECU’s  Velarde˜na  property,  within  the  municipality  of  Nazas,  Durango
State. The Company does not own the claims but is studying areas within the property under the terms of an agreement which will allow
it to purchase the claims through a series of instalment payments at the Company’s option.
Flechas
The Flechas project is located between the states of Durango and Zacatecas in the municipality of Santa Clara, Durango. It is located
approximately 75.5 km southeast of the Company´s Oxide Mill and 20 km northeast of the Santa Clara town. It consists of a block of
four mining concessions covering 948.52 hectares. Agreements are in place with the surface owners to conduct exploration and mining
operations.
Presentation
The prior year’s figures have been changed to correct for an error in the allocation of the cost of acquiring certain mineral concessions
as between properties. The effect of the change is to increase the acquisition costs for the San Diego property by $205,080 and decrease
the acquisition costs for the Velarde˜na property by $205,080. This change has no effect on the balance of mining properties in total.

Term loan
As at year end the Company owed $16,528,801 ($16,618,541 US dollars) on its term loan. An extension to the existing facility was signed
during the year, the terms of which call for principal repayments in equal monthly instalments for 12 months commencing January 31,
2011. Interest is payable quarterly and is calculated at the greater of 12% and 1-month London Interbank Offered Rate plus 6%. The
effective rate of interest on the loan is 12.8%. The loan is secured by a first mortgage covering certain of the current mining properties
of the Company’s Mexican subsidiaries, as well as the current and future facilities constructed thereon.
During the year the Company began negotiations with its lender to restructure the debt, and subsequent to year end, the restructuring
was completed. Principal repayments under the amended facility are payable in thirty equal monthly payments commencing July 31,
2011  and  ending  December  31,  2013.  The  terms  of  interest  payable  under  the  restructured  facility  were  unchanged.  The  statements
reflect the effect of the restructuring which was to reduce the current portion of the debt from $16,528,801 to $3,305,760 and to increase
working capital by $13,223,041.

In the prior year, Company entered into contracts which terminated the legal actions related to title of four mineral concessions on the
Velarde˜na property and settled the title matter. Under the terms of the contracts, the Company agreed to pay a total of $6,000,000 US
dollars  in  a  series  of  6  payments  of  $1,000,000  US  dollars,  commencing  May  19,  2009  and  running  semi-annually  thereafter  ending
November 17, 2011, without interest. Under the terms of the contracts, a 30% interest in the title to the concessions will transfer to the
counterparty should the Company fail to make the payments agreed there under.
The fair value of the debt at initial recognition was estimated using the discounted cash flow method. The debt is being accreted over
the expected life of 21⁄2 years using the effective interest method at a rate of 15.5%.
Facilities loan
This  loan  carries  interest  at  10%  and  is  repayable  over  a  5  year  term  in  monthly  payments  of  principal  and  interest  of  $1,698  and
matures February 2013.

SHARE CAPITAL (Continued)
In  the  prior  year,  the  Company  completed  an  offering  of  16,946,000  special  warrants  (the  ‘‘Special  Warrants’’)  to  subscribers  on  a
private placement basis at a price of $0.72 per Special Warrant for a total gross proceeds of $12,201,120. The net proceeds of the issue of
$10,801,114 were reflected in a separate category in Shareholders’ Equity at December 31, 2009.
Effective January 27, 2010, following receipt of a short form prospectus filing, all the outstanding Special Warrants were deemed to be
exercised, resulting in the issuance of 16,946,000 units (the ‘‘Unit’’). Each Unit was comprised of one common share in the share capital
of the Company and one-half of one warrant to purchase a common share in the share capital of the Company (each whole warrant, a
‘‘Purchase  Warrant’’).  Each  Purchase  Warrant  entitles  the  holder  thereof  to  purchase  one  common  share  in  the  share  capital  of  the
Company at an exercise price of $0.90 per Purchase Warrant at any time before December 9, 2011. The gross proceeds of the Special
Warrant offering were assigned on deemed conversion $10,421,790 to common shares and $1,779,330 to warrants. The fair value of the
warrants  was  estimated  on  the  date  of  the  private  placement  based  on  the  Black-Scholes  option  pricing  model  using  the  following
assumptions: risk-free interest rate 1.0%, expected life 2 years, expected volatility 65%, and expected dividend yield 0%. The costs of
the private placement issue have been reflected as share issuance costs.
In December 2010, the Company received proceeds for the exercise of the 300,000 stock options recorded. The related share issuance
was completed by the Company’s registrar in January 2011.
9.
STOCK OPTIONS
Under the terms of the Company’s stock option plan (the ‘‘Plan’’) 14,252,398 Common Shares have been reserved for issuance. Options
under  the  Plan  are  permitted  to  be  granted  to  directors,  officers,  employees  and  consultants  of  the  Company,  provided  that  the
maximum  number  of  Common  Shares  which  may  be  reserved  for  issuance  to  any  one  beneficiary  in  any  12  month  period  may  not
exceed 5% of the number of Common Shares then issued and outstanding or 2% in the case of a beneficiary who is conducting investor
relations  activities.  The  exercise  price  of  options  granted  under  the  Plan  is  not  permitted  to  be  less  than  the  closing  price  of  the
Common Shares on the day preceding the grant of the options, less any discount allowed by applicable securities legislation. Options
granted  pursuant  to  the  Plan  will  have  an  exercise  period  of  no  more  than  10  years,  or  such  lesser  period  as  may  be  permitted  by
applicable securities legislation.
During the year the Company granted 100,000 stock options with an estimated fair value of $34,974 to an officer of the Company. The
Company reflected $26,230 of the fair value as mining property costs during the period with contributed surplus increased by the same
amount.  On  November  15,  2010,  25,000  of  the  options  were  cancelled  and  as  result  the  remainder  of  the  fair  value  will  not  be
recognized. The exercise price of the options granted was greater than the market price at the date of grant. The fair value of stock
options issued was estimated at the grant date based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following weighted average
assumptions:

Option pricing models including the Black-Scholes model require the input of highly subjective assumptions that can materially affect
the fair value estimate and therefore do not necessarily provide a reliable measure of the fair value of the Company’s stock options.

13. CONTINGENCIES
Intangible Asset
In January 2005, the Company acquired the rights to use a technology which is expected to increase material recuperation of current
and future Mexican projects. At the time the agreement was reached the Company issued 500,000 common shares and the Company is

bound  to  issue  an  additional  500,000  common  shares  should  it  choose  to  use  the  technology  at  a  commercial  scale.  In  addition,  the
agreement  provides  that  the  Company  pay  royalties  of  1.5%  of  all  production  resulting  from  the  application  of  the  technology  in
Mexican properties. The technology was not employed in the current period.
Arbitration
During the year, the Company completed the arbitration hearing held pursuant to a Notice of Arbitration, received June 23, 2009 from
Golden  Tag  wherein  Golden  Tag  sought  to  refer  certain  matters,  pertaining  to  the  operation  of  the  joint  venture,  to  arbitration  for
resolution. On September 20, 2010 the Arbitration Panel rendered their conclusion in the matter. The Company finds the award of the
arbitration panel (‘‘Arbitration Award’’) to be fair and has settled the matter with Golden Tag.
The  conclusions  reached  in  the  Arbitration  Award  have  resulted  in  an  increase  in  the  Velarde˜na  mining  property  costs  of  $61,171
related to cost of material from the joint venture property processed in the Company’s plant.

15. EXPLANATORY NOTE FOR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
Within  the  grouping  Investment  Activities,  the  amount  of  $2,487,037,  stated  as  the  cash  expenditure  on  mining  property  acquisition
costs,  includes  an  amount  of  $2,331,600  which  reflects  a  cash  expenditure  made  under  the  terms  of  the  contracts  described  under
Mineral concession liability in note 7.
16. MANAGEMENT OF CAPITAL
The  Company’s  objectives  in  managing  its  capital  resources  are  to  ensure  the  entity’s  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern.  The
Company satisfies its capital requirements through careful management of its cash resources and by utilizing credit facilities or issuing
equity, as necessary, based on the prevalent economic conditions of both the industry and the capital markets and the underlying risks
characteristics of the related assets.
As at December 31, 2010, the Company had long-term debt of $16,618,541 US dollars, repayment of which was scheduled to commence
January  31,  2011.  In  January  2011,  the  Company  restructured  the  facility  with  its  lender.  Principal  repayments  under  the  amended
facility are payable in thirty equal monthly payments commencing July 31, 2011 and ending December 31, 2013.
The Company is also obligated to semi-annual payments of $1,000,000 US dollars due under terms of a mineral concession agreement.
Based on current plans and estimates management believes that its operations can be funded through working capital, potential future
credit facilities, and cash flow expected to be generated from the sale of products from its operations. As discussed note 1, the Company
is dependent on its ability to raise the necessary capital to fund its operations and management can not provide assurance that it will
ultimately be able to complete the required funding transactions. Furthermore, since we do not have proven and probable reserves we
can  not  predict  with  confidence  the  level  of  cash  flows  that  will  be  generated  from  the  new  mill.  As  such,  we  may  need  to  either
restructure our long term debt so that repayment requirements match the cash generation capability or raise additional equity in the
alternate. Management can provide no guarantee that the Company will be successful in these transactions should they be required.

Under  Canadian  GAAP,  costs  of  acquiring  mineral  properties  and  related  development  expenditures  are  deferred.  Exploration
costs  on  mineral  properties,  other  than  acquisition  costs,  are  deferred  and  capitalized  under  Canadian  GAAP  prior  to  the
establishment  of  proven  or  probable  reserves  if  they  are  considered  to  meet  the  definition  of  an  asset.  United  States  GAAP
requires that all exploration costs be expensed.
b.
Inventories
The Company has reflected its gold pyrite material-in-process inventory at a net realizable value of zero and, as such, recorded
write-downs of inventory and an expense in the statement of loss. Under Canadian GAAP, the Company subsequently recorded a
reversal of those write offs at the point where sales contracts for the related inventory were put in place. United States GAAP does
not permit the reversal of previous write-downs of inventory.
c. Mining property costs classification in other income
Under  Canadian  GAAP,  net  revenue  or  expense  derived  from  a  mineral  property  prior  to  the  production  phase  of  a  mine  is
capitalized and included in the cost of the asset. A United States GAAP adjustment arises because United States GAAP requires
that  all  exploration  related  costs  and  associated  revenues  be  expensed.  Furthermore,  United  States  GAAP  requires  that  any
incremental and direct costs associated with the sale of excavated saleable minerals during the development phase of the mine and
prior to the production phase of the mine be classified as Other income and offset by the related amounts of proceeds from the sale

of these minerals. Incremental and direct costs are those costs that would otherwise have not been incurred if not for the sale of
these minerals.
d.
Stock-based compensation and stock options
Under Canadian GAAP, stock-based compensation costs and stock option costs incurred during the exploration or development
stage of the mineral properties are deferred and capitalized prior to the establishment of proven or probable reserves if they are
considered  to  meet  the  definition  of  an  asset.  United  States  GAAP  requires  that  all  stock-based  compensation  costs  and  stock
option costs be expensed.
e. Convertible debentures
Under Canadian GAAP, convertible debenture proceeds are allocated between their debt and equity component parts based on the
relative fair values of the debt component and the embedded conversion feature. The debt component is accreted to the face value
of  the  debentures  with  the  resulting  interest  expense  charged  to  operations.  The  costs  of  the  financing  are  allocated  on  a
proportional basis between the liability and equity portions based on their relative fair values with the liability portion of the costs
expensed  and  the  equity  portion  treated  as  a  reduction  of  the  gross  proceeds  allocated  to  the  equity  component.  United  States
GAAP  treats  the  convertible  debenture  solely  as  a  liability  since  the  embedded  conversion  feature  does  not  meet  US  GAAP
requirements for classification as an equity component. The liability is recorded at its full face value since the embedded conversion
feature has no intrinsic value on a stand-alone basis and accordingly does not meet the requirements of an equity component under
United States GAAP. United States GAAP requires that convertible debentures, net of issuance costs, be accreted to face value
over the term ending on the first put date of the debentures which, in this case, is the issuance date of the debentures since the
debentures  are  convertible  on  demand  by  the  Unit  holders.  Thus,  the  debentures’  carrying  value  equals  their  face  value  on  the
balance sheet.
f. Mining property costs classification in statement of cash flow
United States GAAP requires that cash flows relating to mineral property exploration and land use costs be reported as operating
activities. However, under Canadian GAAP mineral property exploration and land use costs are classified as investing activities.
g. Restricted cash
Under Canadian GAAP, restricted cash was disclosed as a separate line item in the statement of cash flows. United States GAAP
requires that restricted cash be disclosed as a financing activity.
Other disclosures:
The following additional information would be presented if these consolidated financial statements were presented in accordance
with U.S. GAAP:
i. Auditor’s Report: Emphasis of matter paragraph
In the United States, reporting standards for auditors require the addition of an explanatory paragraph (following the opinion
paragraph) when the financial statements are affected by conditions and events that cast substantial doubt on the Company’s
ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern,  such  as  those  described  in  Note  1  to  the  financial  statements.  Canadian  reporting
standards do not permit a reference to such events and conditions in the auditors’ report when these are adequately disclosed
in  the  financial  statements.  The  Auditor  draws  attention  to  Note  1  to  the  financial  statements,  which  describes  certain
conditions that give rise to substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Auditor’s opinion is not qualified
in respect of this matter.
ii. Joint Venture
San Diego Joint Venture has been recorded under Canadian GAAP on a proportionate basis whereas under United States
GAAP, investments in incorporated joint ventures should be accounted for using the equity method. However, the Company

has  elected  to  use  the  accommodation  of  the  SEC  whereby  the  accounting  for  joint  ventures  need  not  be  reconciled  from
Canadian  GAAP  to  United  States  GAAP  since  the  different  accounting  treatment  affects  only  the  presentation  and
classification of financial statement items and not net income or shareholders’ equity.

v. Income tax uncertainty
The Company and its subsidiaries file federal income tax returns in Canada and Mexico; the Company’s Mexican subsidiaries
also file Mexican state tax returns where required by law. With few exceptions, the Company and its Mexican subsidiaries are
subject  to  Canadian  federal  or  Mexican  federal,  state  and  local  examinations  by  the  tax  authorities  for  a  minimum  of  four
years in arrearage to the extent that the Company receives a notice of assessment from the respective competent authorities.
vi. Deferred income tax
Canadian  GAAP  financial  statements  do  not  take  into  account  the  tax  benefit  arising  from  loss  carry  forwards  which  are
available to the Company to reduce its income for tax purposes in future periods so that no deferred income tax has been
recorded in the Canadian GAAP financial statements. Deferred tax assets are not recognized for the tax benefit arising from
loss  carry  forwards  to  the  extent  that  it  is  not  probable  that  taxable  profits  will  be  available  against  which  these  loss  carry
forwards  can  be  utilized  in  the  future.  The  Company  has  disclosed  its  non-capital  loss  carry  forwards  and  tax  loss  carry
forwards as at December 31, 2010 in Note 19, ‘‘Loss carry forwards’’ to these consolidated financial statements. Therefore,
consistent with the current Canadian GAAP accounting treatment, no deferred income tax consequences have been recorded
under United States GAAP relating to US GAAP adjustments recorded in the reconciliations forthwith.
