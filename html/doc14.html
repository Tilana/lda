Summary of Facts
1. On March 14th, 1995 the complainant brought a case against the Republic of Congo and the Municipal
Office of Brazzaville before the Court of First Instance of Brazzaville, sitting on civil matters, with a view to
obtaining the recognition of the responsibility of the Congolese Republic, as well as reparation for the
damage caused to his personal property and real estate following barbaric acts carried out by soldiers,
armed bands and uncontrolled elements of the Congolese National Police Force, during the socio-political
upheavals that took place in the country in 1993.
2. On February 18th 1997 the civil division of the Court of First Instance passed a ruling ordering the
Congolese Republic and the Municipal Office of Brazzaville to pay the following amounts:
Principal amount for all the damage caused: 180,000,000.00 FCFA
Damages: 15,000,000.00 FCFA
Amount representing legal costs: 7,000.00 FCFA
Total amount: 195,037,000.00 FCFA
That is the equivalent of 297,333.98 euros, the whole being immediately enforceable.
3. On March 19th 1997, the ruling became legally binding and a certificate of no-appeal was issued to the
complainant (see file).
4. In a letter dated May 20th 1999, the Minister of Justice asked the Minister of Economy, Finance and
Budget of Congo to enforce the ruling. However, in a letter dated December 30th 1999, the Minister of
Economy, Finance and Budget refused to execute the ruling, for no apparent reason.

Complaint
5. The complainant alleges the violation of violates Articles 2, 3, 21(2) of the African Charter. The
complainant is asking the African Commission to recommend to the Republic of Congo Brazzaville to
comply with the ruling which has been passed on behalf of the Congolese people, and to comply at the
same time with the provisions of the Charter to which it is signatory.

Law
Admissibility
39. The admissibility of communications submitted in conformity with Article 55 of the Charter is governed
by the conditions spelt out by Article 56 of the same Charter. According to Article 56(5) communications
can only be considered if they are submitted "after the exhaustion of local remedies, if any, unless it is
obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged".
40. According to Article 56(2), communications brought before the African Commission shall be "compatible
with the Charter of the [OAU] or with the present Charter", and in terms of Article 56(5), communication will
not be examined unless they "are sent after exhausting local remedies, if any unless it is obvious that this
procedure is unduly prolonged".
41. The Complainant has submitted evidence that he brought an action before the Court of First Instance
which delivered a ruling on the 18th February 1997, condemning the Respondent State to pay to him the
amount of 195,037,000 FCFA, namely the equivalent of 297,333.98 Euros. This judgment was not
contested by the Respondent State. A certificate of no appeal had been delivered to the Complainant by
the Registrar of the Court.
42. The Complainant added the certificate of no appeal to the case file, which means that the judgment is
final and should be executed. He produced supporting documents certifying that the file had been
forwarded by the Ministry of Justice to the Ministry of the Economy, Finances and Budget for execution.
The Complainant alleges that despite several notices sent requesting it to honour its debt, the Respondent
State has refused to comply.
43. The Complainant alleges that the ruling, in relation to which execution is being called for is final and
binding. He contends that the certificate of no appeal added to the case file legally establishes that there
are no other remedies to be brought against the said ruling.
44. The Complainant alleges that in a country where the rule of law exists, the fact that an Administrative
Officer refuses to execute a decision of the Court against which there are no more legal remedies, is a
constitutive case of criminal offence.
45. The Respondent State, in making an oral presentation of its grounds of defence before the African
Commission during its 34th Ordinary Session, did not contest the facts of the complaint. It however raised a
plea of inadmissibility regarding the Complainant's request on the grounds that the rule of exhaustion of
local remedies had not been observed.
46. Regarding the incompatibility with the Charter, the Congolese State alleges that the object of the
communication does not fall under the jurisdiction devolving on the [African] Commission in terms of Article
45 of the Charter that is to promote and protect human and peoples' rights in Africa. According to the State,
"...The [African Charter] has established a non-jurisdictional mechanism to guarantee rights and freedoms,
the decisions of the latter having just a moral significance and are not binding. Therefore, the [African]
Commission could not turn into a jurisdiction to consider requests for the payment of money against states."
47. The [African] Commission observes that the communication is based on allegations of violation of
provisions of the Charter which it has the mandate to promote and protect. As the State itself
acknowledged it in its submission, the African Commission "controls the conformity of State Parties actions
to [African Charter]". The [African] Commission finds that in the case under consideration, in seizing the
[African] Commission, the Complainant does not have any other intention than to request the latter to play
its role by controlling the conformity to Articles 2, 3, 21(2) of the Charter of an action (the refusal to enforce
a court decision in favour of the Complainant) of a State party (the Republic of Congo). The [African]
Commission concludes that the object of the communication falls under its mandate and, as a result, finds
that the communication is compatible with the Charter.
48. Regarding the exhaustion of local remedies, the Respondent State contends that the complainant had a
remedy against the refusal of the Minister of the Economy, Finances and Budget to execute this ruling in
accordance with the provisions of Articles 405 to 409 of the Code of Civil, Commercial, Administrative and
Financial Procedure. These articles stipulate that: "any citizen who is qualified and so wishes has the right
3

to bring an appeal for annulment against any regulatory or individual decision by an administrative
Authority. Such an appeal must be brought within two (2) months from the date of the publication or
notification of the grievance on the one hand, and exceptionally within four (4) months in case of silence
from the administration which is interpreted as an implicit dismissal, on the other...".
49. Article 410 of the same Code adds: "Nonetheless, before applying for the annulment of an
administrative decision, the interested Party may present, within 2 months, an appeal to a higher or the
same administrative Authority to cancel the said decision. In such a case, the application for annulment will
only be effective either from the date of the notification of the dismissal of the administrative appeal, or on
the expiry of the 4 months stipulated in the Article 408 mentioned above"
50. The Respondent State alleges that in the case under consideration, starting from the date of the
notification of the unjustified dismissal of his case by the Minister for Economy, Finance and Budget, the
complainant should have, within 2 months, brought an appeal either to the same administrative authority, or
to the Head of Government as a higher administrative authority.
51. The Respondent State contends that such an early administrative appeal would have allowed the
Complainant to have the negative decision annulled. Otherwise, the Complainant should have secured the
real grounds for the dismissal of his claims to allow him make a submission for an annulment at the expiry
of the above mentioned deadlines.
52. The Respondent State alleges that since the refusal of the Minister was an administrative decision, the
Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court was competent to deal with its annulment, in accordance
with the provisions of Article 3 of law No. 17-99 of 15th April 1999 modifying and supplementing certain
provisions of law No. 025-92 of 20th August 1992 and law No. 30-94 of 18th October 1994 governing the
organisation and functioning of the Supreme Court. This article stipulates that: "the Supreme Court shall
rule on appeals relating to abuses of power lodged against decisions from various authorities".
53. Finally the Respondent State stresses that the Complainant, an attorney by profession, is hardly
ignorant of the procedural subtleties of Congolese law and that under the circumstances, he should have
submitted his grievances beforehand to the Congolese Courts which have primacy over subsidiary
international appeals.
54. The Respondent State concluded that the Complainant did not resort to any internal remedy after the
administrative decision rejecting his case and, in consequence, did not comply with one of the essential
rules governing the admissibility of communications before the African Commission, namely that of
exhaustion of local remedies.
55. All the conditions laid down by Article 56 have been fulfilled by this communication. However, the rule
stipulating the exhaustion of local remedies as a requirement for the submission of a communication before
the African Commission assumes that the Respondent State should first of all have the opportunity to
compensate, by its own means and within the context of its system of domestic law, for any prejudice that
may have been caused to an individual.
56. The African Commission, in communications 48/90, 50/91 [52/91] and 89/93 Amnesty International [et]
al./Sudan, ruled that all local remedies, if they exist, if they are of a legal nature, are effective and are not
subordinate to the discretionary power of the public authorities, should be exhausted.
57. The [African] Commission is of the view that the Complainant has exhausted all local remedies in
endeavouring to assert his right to compensation for the prejudice suffered and rejects the Respondent
State's claims that he should have appealed against the decision of the Minister before seizing the [African]
Commission.
58. The [African] Commission notes that no strict legal provision grants the Minister responsible for the
budget any authority to refuse to pay damages which are legally granted. The execution of the judgments
made against the Respondent State therefore appears to be subject to the regular procedure provided for
in the Administrative Procedure Code (Article 293 and the following ones).
59. Under these circumstances, the question which arises is whether the complainant should have initiated
the procedures of forced execution against the Respondent State as provided for by the Administrative
Procedure Code. The [African] Commission considers that it is unreasonable to require from a citizen who
has won the case of a payable debt against the State at the end of a legal proceedings to institute
procedures of seizure against it (assuming that it is possible to resort to this means of imposition against
the public authorities). As it happened, the Complainant, having duly notified his judgment to the competent
authorities in accordance with the relevant articles of the Administrative Procedure Code, he had a right to
expect the immediate execution of his judgment.1

4

60. The [African] Commission is of the view that the Minister had no right to hinder or delay the execution of
a final judgment without legitimate reason. The [African] Commission observes that the decision of the
Minister was unjustified and that the Respondent State did not, at any time try to clarify to the [African]
Commission the reasons for the refusal by its Officer. In this context, the [African] Commission supports the
position of the European Court according to which even the inability of the Respondent State to pay could
not justify the refusal by the Minister to execute a final judgment.2
61. Furthermore, the [African] Commission considers that the appeal provided for in Article 402 of the
Administrative Procedure Code does not constitute a legal remedy which can be used by the complainant.
The [African] Commission reiterates that local remedies, if any, should be legal, effective and not subject to
the discretionary powers of the public Authorities. Concerning the appeal for annulment provided for in
Article 410 of the Administrative Procedure Code, the [African] Commission is not convinced that it would
have allowed the Complainant to gain satisfaction. Even a ruling by the Supreme Court setting aside the
unjustified decision of the Minister would have given the Complainant the power to demand the execution
of his judgment without however providing him with any means to enforce this ruling. Under these
circumstances, the [African] Commission considers this remedy as ineffective.
62. In conclusion, even assuming that the above-mentioned appeals had enabled the complainant to
recover his debt, the [African] Commission observes that the complainant had not been informed of the
reasons underlying the decision of the Minister, a decision about which, moreover, he does not appear to
have been notified.
63. For these reasons and considering the fact that the complainant had duly exhausted all local remedies,
the African Commission declares the communication admissible.
Merits
64. The Complainant alleges the violation of Article 2 of the African Charter which stipulates that "Every
individual has the right to enjoy the rights and freedoms recognised and guaranteed in the present
Charter..." and the violation of Article 3 of the African Charter which stipulates that "Every individual shall be
equal before the law, every individual shall be entitled to equal protection of the law".
65. The Complainant contends that the Respondent State does not treat its citizens in the same manner
and does not guarantee the total equality of its citizens before the law by leaving it to the discretion of the
Minister of the Economy, Finance and the Budget to choose which judgments to honour. In support of his
allegations, he alludes to the letter of the Permanent Secretary of the Minister dated 30th December 1999
which rejects, without justification, the request for execution of his judgment and those of two other people.
66. It is important to point out here that a judgment rendered in the presence of both Parties had jointly and
severally condemned the Republic of Congo and the Mayor's Office of Brazzaville to pay the Complainant
the amounts of 180,000,000 FCFA representing principal and 15,000,000 FCFA representing damages and
interest, in compensation for the prejudice caused to his personal assets and property by the soldiers and
officers of the national Police Force during the socio-political upheavals of 1993. Neither the Republic of
Congo, nor the Brazzaville Mayor's Office lodged an appeal against the judgment, so that the latter became
final on the 19th March 1997. On the 30th December 1999, with no apparent reason, the Permanent
Secretary of the Minister of the Economy, Finance and Budget informed the Minister of Justice about his
refusal to execute the judgment of the Complainant.
67. The Respondent State does not oppose the facts alleged in this communication but refutes the
allegations of discrimination. It retorts that the three individuals affected by the Minister's refusal do not
come from the same ethnic group or region nor do they share the same religion or political opinion. One of
the individuals concerned is even said to be a former Minister of the Government who was actually holding
office at the time of the rejection. Under the circumstances, the Congolese State contends that the
communication constitutes an abuse of rights in terms of Rule 144(1)(c) of the African Commission's Rules
of Procedure.
68. The two provisions cited by the Complainant repose, on the one hand, on the principle of
non-discrimination and on the other, on that of equality. These principles mean that citizens should be
treated in a fair and equitable manner before the law and have the right to enjoy, with no distinction
whatsoever, the rights guaranteed by the Charter. The right to equality is all the more important since it
determines the possibility for the individual to enjoy many other rights.
69. Like Article 14

5

× The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without
discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion,
national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.
of the European Convention, Article 2 does not stipulate a general banning of discrimination; it only
prohibits discrimination where it affects the enjoyment of a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter. The
[African] Commission considers that the Complainant has not adequately supported his claims of
discrimination to show that this Article has been violated; besides, his not having proven how the enjoyment
of one of the rights guaranteed by the Charter had been hindered in a discriminatory manner, his complaint
is not based on any of the grounds of discrimination listed out in Article 2 or on grounds similar to the latter.
70. Nonetheless, the [African] Commission notes that Article 3 of the African Charter contains a general
guarantee of equality which supplements the ban on discrimination provided for in Article 2. In this regard,
the African Charter differs from the European Convention [on Human Rights] and draws inspiration from the
Agreement on Civil and Political Rights [sic]. Equality before the law, protected by Article 3(1) relates to the
status of individuals before the law. Equal protection by the law, guaranteed in Article 3(2) relates to the
implementation of the law and is applicable where the rights of the Complainant are implemented
unequally.
71. The [African] Commission further notes that for Article 3 to be applicable, the inequality alleged by the
Complainant should follow from the 'law'. In this context, the legislative or regulatory Act constitutes the
most unambiguous form of law. It is obvious however that Member States could easily circumvent the
Charter i[f] the term 'law' were to be restricted to these formal methods of legislating. The [African]
Commission is of the opinion that the Member States would violate Article 3 if they were to exercise a
power or judgment conferred by a law in a discriminatory manner. As it happens, the refusal by the Minister
of the Economy, Finance and the Budget is not based on any specific legislative authority. Nevertheless,
the [African] Commission feels that it was incumbent on the Minister to honour the judgment by virtue of the
rule of law and of the principle of the res judicata.
72. In this context the [African] Commission observes that the complainant was unjustifiably refused the
implementation of a legal ruling which had the character of res judicata. The Minister of the Economy,
Finance and the Budget rejected his request for execution as well as that of two other individuals for no
apparent reason. In [its] claims before the African Commission, the Respondent State did not put forward
any argument to explain the decision of the Minister in rejecting the Complainant's claim. Moreover, in its
submissions dated 30th March 2004 in reaction to the Complainant's arguments, the State has quoted
victims of the same violent events who have been compensated. The Minister thereby transformed the right
of the Complainant to an effective remedy before the Courts into an illusion and denied him the right to fair
legal compensation. Under these circumstances, the [African] Commission is of the view that the decision
of the Minister arbitrarily deprived the Complainant of the protection of the law accorded to other citizens in
accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of the Charter.
73. Furthermore, although the Complainant does not specifically mention this Article of the Charter, the
examination of the facts shows a violation of Article 7 of the Charter concerning the right to fair trial. The
effective exercise of this right by individuals requires that:
"All State Institutions against which an appeal has been lodged or a legal ruling has been pronounced
conform fully with this ruling or this appeal." 3
74. The [African] Commission notes that in similar instances, the European Court of Human Rights
declared that the right to access to a Court guaranteed by Article 6(1)
× In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is
entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal
established by law. Judgement shall be pronounced publicly by the press and public may be excluded from
all or part of the trial in the interest of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society,
where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or the extent
strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the
interests of justice.
of the European Convention on Human Rights would be illusory if the domestic laws of a State allowed a
final and binding legal ruling to remain ineffective to the detriment of one Party. The Court therefore ruled
that the execution of a judgment, no matter from what jurisdiction, should be considered as being an
integral part of the 'proceedings' in accordance with Article 6. The Court further recognised that the
effective protection of the person to be tried and the re-establishment of legality constituted an obligation for
6

the State to comply with a judgment or ruling pronounced by the highest Court in the land. In consequence,
by virtue of this Article, the execution of a legal ruling can neither be unduly prevented, nullified nor
delayed. 4
75. The [African] Commission is also of the view that the right to be heard guaranteed by Article 7 of the
African Charter includes the right to the execution of a judgment. It would therefore be inconceivable for this
Article to grant the right for an individual to bring an appeal before all the national courts in relation to any
act violating the fundamental rights without guaranteeing the execution of judicial rulings. To interpret
Article 14 any other way would lead to situations which are incompatible with the rule of law. As a result,
the execution of a final judgment passed by a Tribunal or legal court should be considered as an integral
part of the right to be heard which is protected by Article 7.
76. Furthermore, the [African] Commission considers that the refusal by the Minister to honour the
judgment passed in favour of the Complainant also constitutes a violation of Article 14 of the Charter.
Although the complainant only alluded to this Article at the moment of his argument, the [African]
Commission considers that his initial claims sufficiently supported a claim of violation of the right to
property. Drawing inspiration from the jurisprudence of the European Court for Human Rights under Article
1 of Protocol No. 1
× 1. Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be
deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law
and by the general principles of international law.
The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as
it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the
payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties."
of the European Convention on Human Rights,5 the [African] Commission considers that a monetary
compensation granted by judgment having acquired the authority of res judicata should be considered as
an asset. Therefore, the unjustified refusal of the Respondent State to honour the final judgment passed in
favour of the Complainant hindered the enjoyment of his assets.
77. The African Commission appreciates the fact that in spite of the situation which was then prevailing in
the Republic of Congo during the period under review, the Court had been able to act rapidly and firmly in
pronouncing the judgments in a bid to restore the rule of law.
78. The African Commission nonetheless remains conscious of the fact that without a system of effective
execution, other forms of private justice can spring up and have negative consequences on the confidence
and credibility of the public in the justice system.
79. Finally, the [African] Commission wishes to make some comments with regard to the claims of the
Complainant based on Article 21(2) of the Charter. This Article stipulates that "in case of spoliation the
dispossessed people shall have the right to the lawful recovery of their property as well as to an adequate
compensation". The Complainant contends that the Respondent State violated this Article in refusing to
honour a judgment of the Brazzaville High Court upholding the total responsibility of the Respondent State
and that of the Brazzaville Mayor's Office in relation to the looting of his assets by the soldiers and the
unruly elements of the National Police Force.
80. The African Charter does not provide a definition of the concept of 'people' that is found in Articles 19 to
24. This concept nonetheless defines third generation rights whose recognition constitutes the main
distinctive feature of the African Charter. Article 21 of the Charter is one of these rights; it guarantees to all
peoples the right to freely dispose of their wealth and natural resources. Under the terms of this Article, a
people stripped of their wealth and natural resources ha[ve] the right to the recovery of its property and to
an adequate compensation.
81. In communication 155/96 (2001) Social and Economic Rights Action Center, Centre for Economic and
Social Rights/Nigeria, the African Commission recalled in the following terms, the origin of Article 21: "[This]
provision dates back to the colonial period during which the material and human resources of Africa had
been greatly exploited by foreign powers, thus creating a tragedy for the Africans themselves, depriving
them of their inalienable rights and land". Considering its nature and its objective, this Article can only be
referred to in the exclusive interest of a people that has the legitimate right to an adequate compensation
as well as to the recovery of its assets in case of spoliation.
82. In this case, the movable and immovable property of the complainant that had been destroyed during
the socio-political events which shook the country in 1993 does not constitute the wealth and natural
resources of a people but rather individual assets. It is important to point out that in the present
communication the complainant is acting on his own behalf and on behalf of a group of individuals or of a
7

population living in a given territory. Under these circumstances, the African Commission does not find any
violation of Article 21(2) of the African Charter.
83. The Complainant also requests the [African] Commission to prescribe the Respondent State to pay him
damages and a daily penalty for delay in payment of the sum granted to him by a court ruling, which he
estimates at 200.000.000 FCFA [and] 50.000.000 FCFA respectively.
84. The [African] Commission, although admitting that the Complainant suffered some loss due to the delay
in the payment of the sum granted by Congolese courts, does not consider itself in a position to put a figure
to the loss. This is the reason why, relying on its jurisprudence, especially its decision on communication
59/916 , the [African] Commission recommends that the amount of the compensation be determined
according to Congolese legislation.

Decision of the African Commission

× The Court reiterates that Article 6 § 1 secures to everyone the right to have any claim relating to his civil
rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal; in this way it embodies the "right to a court", of
which the right of access, that is the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, constitutes
one aspect. However, that right would be illusory if a Contracting State's domestic legal system allowed a
final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable
that Article 6 § 1 should describe in detail procedural guarantees afforded to litigants - proceedings that are
fair, public and expeditious - without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article
6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to
lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook
to respect when they ratified the Convention. Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be
regarded as an integral part of the "trial" for the purposes of Article 6 (see Hornsby v. Greece, judgment of
19 March 1997, Reports 1997-II, p. 510, § 40)
7th May 2002, and Ruianu vs. Rumania, no. 34647/97, 17th June 2003.
