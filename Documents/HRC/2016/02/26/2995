<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 22 November 2011, the Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful 
assembly and of association sent a questionnaire to all Member States, national human 
rights institutions, regional human rights mechanisms, non-governmental organizations, and 
other stakeholders to identify best practices that promote and protect the rights to freedom 
of peaceful assembly and of association. This questionnaire is reproduced in English in 
chapter II of the present report. A total of 87 replies were received and informed the first 
thematic report of the Special Rapporteur (A/HRC/20/27). The Special Rapporteur is 
grateful to all those who replied to his questionnaire. 
</p>
<p>2. The information submitted is available through the hyperlinks listed in chapter III of 
the present report. Responses received are reproduced in their entirety as received. For ease 
of reference the responses have been grouped by categories of senders and in the language 
of submission. The States are listed in alphabetical order according to their names in the 
English language. When non-governmental organizations making the submission expressed 
protection concerns or fear of reprisals and requested confidentiality, their names were not 
disclosed. 
</p>
<p>3. The responses have not been edited and should not be construed as reflecting the 
views of the Special Rapporteur.  
</p>
