<p><b>  Mission to Armenia</b>* 
</p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders conducted a 
country visit to Armenia from 12 to 18 June 2010, during which she met with senior 
Government officials as well as with a broad range of human rights defenders. The purpose 
of the visit was to assess the situation of human rights defenders in Armenia in light of the 
principles set forth in the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders. 
</p>
<p> Following an introductory chapter, in chapter II the Special Rapporteur presents the 
general context in which human rights defenders in Armenia operate.  Civil society and in 
particular human rights defenders, function within an increasingly politicized environment 
and few actors have been unaffected by the political divisions of recent years, particularly 
in the wake of the 2008 events. 
</p>
<p> In chapter III, the Special Rapporteur describes the legal and institutional framework 
for the promotion and protection of human rights in Armenia.  She regrets that recently 
adopted and proposed amendments to the existing legislative framework may obstruct the 
activities of human rights defenders and is particularly disturbed regarding reports of 
violence against defenders.

 In chapter IV, the Special Rapporteur details the current challenges faced by human 
rights defenders in Armenia in their legitimate activities. She highlights that the events of 
March 2008 have contributed to a very politicized environment, preventing constructive 
cooperation between the authorities, the Ombudsperson and human rights defenders. Other 
challenges include restrictions on freedom of association, impediments to the freedom of 
assembly, restrictions on the freedom of expression and impunity for abuses against human 
rights defenders. 
</p>
<p> Finally, in chapter V the Special Rapporteur formulates her conclusions and 
recommendations for consideration by the Government and relevant stakeholders.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 60/251 and Human Rights Council 
resolution 7/8, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders conducted 
an official visit to Armenia from 12 to 18 June 2010, at the invitation of the Government. 
</p>
<p>2. The purpose of the visit was to assess the situation of human rights defenders in 
Armenia in light of the principles set forth in the Declaration on the Right and 
Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect 
Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (hereinafter the 
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders). An examination of the legal framework in the 
country, the institutional policies, and the mechanisms for promotion and protection of 
human rights were of particular importance to this assessment. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government for its ongoing 
cooperation with the special procedures of the Human Rights Council, for extending the 
invitation to her, and for its cooperation prior to and during the mission. During her visit, 
she had the opportunity to meet with the Prime Minister; the Deputy Minister of Foreign 
Affairs; the Minister of Justice; the Chair of the Standing Committee on Protection of 
Human Rights and Public Affairs; the President of the Court of Cassation; the Chair of the 
Constitutional Court; the Deputy Chair of the Standing Committee on State and Legal 
Affairs and the Deputy Head of Police.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur also met with a broad segment of civil society and with 
human rights defenders engaged in a wide range of civil, political, economic, social and 
cultural rights work, as well as with members of the opposition parties, representatives of 
United Nations agencies, diplomatic missions and intergovernmental organizations. She 
would like to thank them for their cooperation and availability throughout her visit. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur would also like to thank the organizations and individuals 
who made her visit possible by coordinating her meetings with the authorities and with civil 
society. In particular, she would like to thank the United Nations Resident Coordinator and 
the Resident Representative of the United Nations Development Programme in Armenia as 
well as her staff at UNDP for the excellent support provided in organizing the visit. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General context in which human rights defenders operate  
</b></p>
<p>6. A state of the Soviet Union starting from 1920, Armenia&#8217;s independence was 
formally declared on 23 September 1991, following a national referendum two days earlier. 
Since then, Armenia has been a democratic republic with a presidential system of 
government, with legislative power belonging to Parliament. Armenia joined the United 
Nations in 1992, and in 2006 issued a standing invitation to all special procedures.  
</p>
<p>7. The most traumatic events of recent Armenian history took place following 
presidential elections on 19 February 2008, in which Serzh Sargsyan, the incumbent Prime 
Minister, was elected President of Armenia. Although Mr. Sargsyan was declared to have 
won the election with 52 per cent of the votes, political opposition groups refused to 
recognize the result and organized popular demonstrations which developed into a 
continuous protest in Yerevan city centre. On 1 March 2008, police forces violently 
dispersed the protesters. Ten persons were killed, two of whom were police officers, while 
hundreds were reported to have been injured. At least 102 demonstrators were arrested, and 
more than 27 cases were documented of detainees alleging ill-treatment while en route to 
police stations or while in police custody. In addition, at least 81 prominent opposition 
political figures and their supporters were arrested between 25 and 27 March 2008, some of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/44/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>whom also alleged ill-treatment whilst in police custody. Furthermore, there were 
documented violations of due process, including incommunicado detention and lack of 
access to a lawyer of one&#8217;s choosing.1   
</p>
<p>8. The international community, including the Council of Europe and the Organization 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), quickly expressed concern regarding the 
violence and arrests. On 2 March 2008, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights issued a press statement expressing her concern regarding &#8220;reports that force had 
been used against peaceful demonstrators and that opposition protestors had been 
detained&#8221;. She called upon the authorities &#8220;to exercise the utmost restraint and to ensure 
that due process is followed in the case of any detention&#8221;.2  
</p>
<p>9. A state of emergency declared between 1 and 21 March 2008 provided for a 
temporary blackout of media reporting on opposition activities, and also saw the adoption 
by Parliament of new, restrictive amendments to the Law on Peaceful Assemblies. The 
political situation since then has stabilized, yet opposition groups and large sectors of civil 
society continue to criticize the ruling administration. In addition, implications of the 
March 2008 violence continue to impact on the working environment for human rights 
defenders in Armenia.  
</p>
<p>10. The amendments to the Law on Peaceful Assemblies were withdrawn on 22 April 
2008, following international criticism, yet public assemblies and demonstrations continue 
to be restricted under the pre-existing 2004 legislation. Although an amnesty adopted by the 
National Assembly on 19 June 2009 led to the release of the majority of the remaining 
detainees,3 human rights groups and the opposition have alleged that over a dozen 
opposition supporters remain in prison to date, and called for their recognition as political 
prisoners. The Government in turn claims that those detained in connection with the March 
2008 events are not being detained for political reasons, but rather for specific offences, 
including the illegal storage of weapons and ammunition.4 
</p>
<p>11. In a statement on 14 May 2010, following a visit to Armenia, the President of the 
Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), stated that reforms were 
urgently needed in order to demonstrate &#8220;clear determination&#8221; to &#8220;restore public 
confidence, move towards reconciliation and consolidate the democratic process in the 
country&#8221;.5  
</p>
<p>12. Days after taking office, President Sargsyan established a high-level working group 
to coordinate the implementation of the proposals contained in PACE resolution 1609 
related to the activities of democratic institutions in Armenia. The group, which includes 
representatives of all three branches and from the National Radio and Television 
Commission, has worked towards the implementation of democratic reform. 
</p>
<p>13. In June 2008, the National Assembly of Armenia set up an Ad Hoc Commission for 
Inquiry into the events of 1 and 2 March 2008, which has completed its work and made its 
report public.  Also in June 2008, the Public Council of Armenia was created in accordance 
with the President&#8217;s decree.

</p>
<p>14. In particular, international organizations, international NGOs and local human rights 
groups have repeatedly criticized the lack of any meaningful investigation into the deaths 
and injuries of 1 March 2008, and into the allegations of ill-treatment and violations of due 
process.6 The Government asserts that satisfactory investigations into the allegations of 
police ill-treatment have already been completed.7 As an unresolved issue, this and other 
concerns including corruption, impartiality of the judiciary, lack of independence of the 
media and restrictions to freedom of assembly and association have formed the basis of a 
lingering resentment towards the authorities. Many of those who met with the Special 
Rapporteur during her mission described a pervasive sense of impunity and corruption 
which has profoundly impacted upon the context within which human rights defenders 
operate in Armenia.  
</p>
<p>15. Civil society and, in particular, human rights defenders, function within an 
increasingly politicized environment. Few actors have been unaffected by the political 
divisions of recent years, particularly in the wake of the 2008 events. Few NGOs support 
the Government, yet those who do not openly align themselves with the political opposition 
are often perceived as holding a pro-Government bias, making it increasingly difficult for 
human rights defenders to adopt or maintain positions of political neutrality.  
</p>
<p>16. This trend of politicization has led to suspicion, cynicism, discouragement and 
fragmentation within civil society itself, as human rights defenders find themselves 
competing within an increasingly defensive and adversarial environment, in which they are 
required to protect themselves from discredit and stigmatization. As a result, human rights 
defenders find it difficult to form networks or coalitions between themselves to work more 
effectively, or to cooperate with the government in order to address matters of concern.  
</p>
<p>17. The prevailing atmosphere of political dispute has also led to a context within which 
civil and political rights defenders appear to predominate within the human rights 
community. In contrast, economic and social rights activists, including those who work on 
women&#8217;s&#8217; and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights as well as other social 
issues, are able to escape much of the politicization of other organizations, and the 
authorities have been responsive to some of their recommendations. However, economic 
and social rights activists often find themselves marginalized within dominant human rights 
discourse and are successful in their work insofar as it does not impact on civil and political 
issues, or touch on the vested interests of powerful individuals within society.   
</p>
<p>18. Many international organizations and diplomatic representatives are active in 
Armenia. In particular, international institutions such as PACE and OSCE have been vocal 
in their response to the events of March 2008, as well as in calling for reform. In addition, 
the international community has made considerable funding initiatives in Armenia since 
independence. However, criticism has been expressed that these efforts have at times been 
ineffective. Piecemeal funding has seen much of the development of the past decade 
focused on donor-led projects, with little emphasis on institution- or capacity-building, with 
the effect of restricting the output and focus of the work of human rights defenders. 
Criticism was also expressed to the Special Rapporteur that a lack of coordination between 
members of the international community in the country, as well as lack of a shared 
emphasis on human rights issues, had limited their potential effectiveness in pressuring the 
authorities to recognize and provide necessary infrastructure for human rights defenders.

<p>However, it seems clear that the politicization of human rights organizations has the effect 
of impeding effective cooperation with the diplomatic and international community. 
</p>
<p>19. A lack of human rights infrastructure has impacted in particular on human rights 
defenders with regard to the proposed National Action Plan for Human Rights. The slow 
pace of progress in the drafting and implementation of the plan has been interpreted as 
emblematic of the lack of recognition and working space granted to human rights defenders 
as actors within civil society. In response to calls for the elaboration and implementation of 
a National Action Plan,8 the Government points to the work of the Office of the Human 
Rights Defender (Ombudsperson) in preparing a concept note, and predicts that the first 
draft of the plan should be ready before the end of 2010. However, concerns have been 
expressed regarding the exclusion of human rights defenders and civil society actors from 
this process.   
</p>
<p><b>  III. Legal and institutional framework for the promotion and 
protection of human rights  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1.  Domestic level 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a)  Constitution 
</i></p>
<p>20. Chapter 1 of the Constitution of Armenia, adopted in 1995, specifies that Armenia is 
a sovereign, democratic, social State governed by the rule of law (art. 1). Article 3 further 
specifies that the human being, his or her dignity and fundamental human rights and 
freedoms are of ultimate value. The State shall ensure the protection of fundamental human 
and civil rights in conformity with the principles and norms of international law. The 
Constitution specifies: &#8220;The State shall be limited by fundamental human and civil rights as 
a directly applicable right&#8221; (art. 3).  
</p>
<p>21. Article 6 declares that international treaties shall come into force in the country only 
after being ratified or approved. The international treaties are a constituent part of the legal 
system of the Republic of Armenia.  
</p>
<p>22. Chapter 2 of the Constitution encompasses a set of fundamental human and civil 
rights and freedoms, including the respect for human dignity (art. 14), the right to equality 
before the law (art. 14 (1)), and the prohibition of discrimination based on any ground (art. 
14 (1)). Chapter 2 also includes civil and political rights such as the prohibition of torture 
and inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment (art. 17), the right to effective legal 
remedies (art. 18), the right to freedom of movement (art. 25), the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression (art. 27), the right to freedom of association (art. 28), and the right 
to freedom of peaceful and unarmed assembly (art. 29). The Constitution further grants 
certain economic, social and cultural rights, including the rights to strike and to fair 
remuneration (art. 32), and the right to preserve his or her national and ethnic identity (art. 
41), among many others. 
</p>
<p>23. A referendum on a series of amendments to the Constitution of Armenia took place 
on 27 November 2005. The referendum introduced numerous substantive provisions 
regarding human rights and fundamental freedoms, bringing the Constitution further into 
compliance with international human rights standards.  
</p>
<p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/44/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Law on conducting meetings, assemblies, rallies and demonstrations 
</i></p>
<p>24. The Law of the Republic of Armenia on Conducting Meetings, Assemblies, Rallies 
and Demonstrations was adopted on 28 April 2004. The stated objective of the law is to 
create the necessary conditions to conduct peaceful, unarmed meetings, assemblies, rallies 
and demonstrations while protecting national security and public safety of a democratic 
State, public order, public health and morals, rights, freedoms, dignity and the reputation of 
others (art. 1 (1)).  
</p>
<p>25. The law defines the various categories of meetings and assemblies and declares that, 
as a general rule, mass public events may be organized only after written notification to the 
relevant bodies (art. 10 (1)). The police has the right to terminate the mass public event if it 
is conducted without prior notification, it is prohibited (art.9.4), all organizers are absent, or 
organizers or participants continue violating public order despite warning by a police 
representative (art. 14 (1)).  
</p>
<p>26. The Law has been amended on several occasions notably following criticism by the 
Venice Commission and the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights 
(ODIHR)9 since certain provisions imposed unjustified and excessive restrictions on the 
freedom of assembly.    
</p>
<p><i> (c) Law on public organizations 
</i></p>
<p>27. The Law of the Republic of Armenia on Public Organizations (NGO Law), adopted 
on 4 December 2001, is the core domestic text governing the exercise of the right to 
freedom of association in Armenia. The law establishes a regime of notification in relation 
to the legal existence of non-governmental organizations (NGOs). These may function 
without State registration; however, an unregistered NGO is not recognized as a legal 
entity. 
</p>
<p>28. Public organizations shall be considered registered, unless the registration is 
rejected, or upon expiry of the term set for the consideration of the application for 
registration. The registration of an organization is carried out upon submission of its 
application. The State registration body is obliged to consider the registration application 
and either register the organization or reject its application within 21 days upon receiving 
all required documents.  
</p>
<p>29. A Draft Law on the Amendments to the Law on Public Organizations was approved 
by the Government of Armenia on 23 September 2009. The Draft Law would require the 
convening of the governing body of the organization once every four years (instead of the 
current requirement of no less than once in every two years), the proposed amendments 
would introduce a new requirement for the executive body of the organization to report, in 
order to enhance transparency, on the work and property use of the organization (including 
finances) by 1 April of the following year. This report should be published in at least 1,000 
copies and one copy should be submitted to the relevant State body.  
</p>
<p>30. In the justification of the Draft Law, the Government mentions, inter alia, that a 
number of NGOs have expressed their disappointment that some provisions of the NGO 
Law would create complications for their activities; they have made a series of proposals 
related to enhancing the effectiveness of NGO activities, including amendments to 
legislation. However, since its introduction, more than 90 civil society organizations have 
expressed their opposition to the proposed amendments and various NGO representatives

</b></p>
<p>who met the Special Rapporteur stated that were neither consulted nor were their concerns 
taken into account. It is felt by a coalition of NGOs that by introducing the amendments, 
the Government is attempting to limit the right to establish unions. Further objections relate 
to the perception that by adopting the amendments in their current form, the principle of 
self-governance of civil society organizations would be put in danger, that the State will 
have an opportunity to directly interfere in the internal working of the organization, that the 
reporting requirements would put a significant financial burden on NGOs and that the 
additional paperwork requirement would duplicate the functions of state supervisory 
organs.  
</p>
<p>31. On 30 October 2009, in a letter addressed to the Head of the OSCE Office in 
Yerevan, the Minister of Justice requested an assessment of the draft NGO Law. According 
to OSCE/ODIHR, the Draft Law in its current form lacks overall coherence. Some of the 
changes could possibly be interpreted as improvements to the workings of public 
organizations in Armenia, but others impose additional burdens and attempt to strengthen 
the control of the State over public organizations.  Some of the provisions are therefore 
difficult to justify, and are in tension with relevant international standards and practices. 
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur concurs with the views and analysis of the OSCE/ODIHR 
and wishes to stress the importance of the full and meaningful involvement of 
representatives of civil society in deliberations regarding the Draft Law. The Special 
Rapporteur further regrets that despite requests to this end to the Ministry of Justice and the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, she has not received the latest version of the Draft Law and 
was therefore only able to consider the publicly available version. The Special Rapporteur 
wishes to emphasize the importance of transparency and inclusion of affected organizations 
in the legislative process.  
</p>
<p><i> (d) Law on the human rights defender (Ombudsperson) 
</i></p>
<p>33. The Law of the Republic of Armenia on the Human Rights Defender 
(Ombudsperson), adopted on 21 October 2003,10 regulates the organizational structure and 
functioning of the Ombudsperson&#8217;s Office. Article 2 of the Law of the Republic of Armenia 
on the Human Rights Defender (hereinafter the Law on Human Rights Defender) defines 
the Ombudsperson as an official acting pursuant to the Constitution and the Law of the 
Republic of Armenia, as well as to principles and norms of international law, and who, on 
behalf of the State, protects the human rights and fundamental freedoms if they are violated 
by central and local government agencies or their officials.   
</p>
<p>34. The Ombudsperson is elected by the National Assembly by a three-fifths majority 
for a term of six years. The Ombudsperson is independent in executing his/her powers and 
not subordinated or accountable to any central or local government agency or official (art. 
5). The Ombudsperson considers complaints concerning violations of central and local 
government agencies or their officials of human rights and fundamental freedoms provided 
by the Constitution, laws, other legal acts and the international treaties of the Republic of 
Armenia, and by the principles and norms of international law (art. 7). The Ombudsperson 
can attend Cabinet meetings and sessions of the National Assembly, has free access to 
military units, police detention centres as well as to other places of detention. Under articles 
11 and 12, complaints must be submitted to the Ombudsperson one year from the day when 
the complainant became aware of, or should have become aware of, the violation of his or 
her rights and freedoms. Although the Ombudsperson cannot intervene in judicial 
processes, he or she can ask for information on any case that is at the stage of trial and can

<p>35. Pursuant to section 42 of the Decree of the President of the Republic of Armenia No. 
NH-174-N of 18 July 2007, draft laws concerning human rights and freedoms, prior to their 
submission to the Government, shall be presented to the Ombudsperson for an opinion. The 
Ombudsperson is also designated as the national preventive mechanism pursuant to the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment.

<p><b> 2. Regional level 
</b></p>
<p>36. Armenia has been a member of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (OSCE) since 30 January 1992, of the Council of Europe since 2001, and has 
ratified most of its major human rights instruments, including the Convention for the 
Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms in 2002, the Framework 
Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (1998), the European Social Charter 
(2004), and the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment (2002).  
</p>
<p>37. The Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, the Council of 
Europe Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), and the PACE regularly issue 
reports and adopt recommendations on the human rights situation in Armenia.  
</p>
<p>38. European Union relations with Armenia are governed by the EU-Armenia 
Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, signed in 1996 and entered into force in 1999. 
Armenia became part of the European Neighbourhood Policy in 2004. The first round of 
the EU-Armenian Human Rights Dialogue took place on 9 December 2009.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. International level 
</b></p>
<p>39. As at October 2010, Armenia is a State party to the major United Nations human 
rights treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its 
two Optional Protocols, concerning the right of individual petition and the abolition of the 
death penalty, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and its 
Optional Protocol, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment and its Optional Protocol, the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child and its two Optional Protocols, on the involvement of children in armed conflict and 
on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.  
</p>
<p>40. Armenia has also signed the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Protection of the Rights of 
All Migrant Workers, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its 
Optional Protocol, and the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance.  
</p>
<p>41. Armenia is also a party to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and to the 
Additional Protocols I and II. Armenia signed the Rome Statute of the International 
Criminal Court. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/44/Add.2

</b></p>
<p><b> B.  Institutional framework  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. The Human Rights Defender Office  
</b></p>
<p>42. The Office of the Human Rights Defender was set up in 2004. The International 
Coordinating Committee of National Human Rights Institutions (ICC) accredited the Office 
with &#8220;A&#8221; status in 2006.  
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur met the former and current Ombudspersons, Larisa 
Alaverdyan and Armen Harutyunyan. The latter was appointed in February 2006 in a 
difficult climate, following the departure of the first Ombudsperson. As the institution is 
gradually expanding its activities and gaining recognition, the number of individual 
complaints received is rising.  
</p>
<p>44. In April 2008, the Ombudsperson presented a report on the March 2008 post-
election violence which criticized conduct of the authorities and pointed to a number of 
irregularities committed during and after the 1 March 2008 demonstrations.11 The 
Government unfortunately did not answer questions raised in the Ombudsperson&#8217;s report.  
</p>
<p>45. The Office of the Ombudsperson expressed concern about the lack of financial and 
human resources hindering its mandate and the possible establishment of regional branches. 
The Special Rapporteur is therefore concerned that understaffing as well as the low wages 
of staff members could have a negative impact on the Office&#8217;s independence.  
</p>
<p>46. Several human rights defenders whom the Special Rapporteur met expressed 
skepticism about the role and efficiency of the Office. Their perception is that it is not 
independent and does not necessarily work with human rights defenders. The absence of a 
focal point on human rights defenders and the lack of systematic consultation with the civil 
society were seen as a real impediment to a fruitful collaboration. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. The Standing Committee on Protection of Human Rights and Public Affairs 
</b></p>
<p>47. The Standing Committee on Protection of Human Rights and Public Affairs of the 
National Assembly (hereinafter the Standing Committee) has a supervisory function and 
receives a number of complaints from the general public (approximately 100 since June 
2007).12 
</p>
<p>48. It is composed of nine deputies and its spheres of activities include human and civil 
rights and freedoms, law and notary services, children&#8217;s rights, parties and other public 
associations, religion, gender issues, national minorities, information.13 In particular, the 
Standing Committee has a role in drafting laws and was involved in the drafting of the 
NGO Law.  
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur met with the Chair of the Standing Committee who reported 
that public hearings were convened on the Draft NGO Law and that NGOs then had the 
opportunity to comment on the draft amendments. Nonetheless, he had received a letter of 
complaint signed by 280 NGOs about the amendments and transmitted the NGOs&#8217; concerns 
to the Chair of the National Assembly. The Special Rapporteur was assured by the Chair

<p>that the Draft NGO Law will not be adopted before new public hearings following the 
summer judicial recess. 
</p>
<p>50. In relation to the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, the Standing Committee 
expresses its readiness to amend relevant laws if the Ombudsperson was to submit a 
proposal of draft legislation on the domestication of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p><b> 3.  The National Television and Radio Commission  
</b></p>
<p>51. The National Television and Radio Commission (NTRC) is the regulatory body 
appointed to oversee regulation and licensing of private broadcast media in Armenia. 
Established under article 37 of the Law on Television and Radio Broadcasting 2000,14 the 
NTRC is described as &#8220;an independent State regulating body&#8221;.15 This is not to be confused 
with the Council of Public Television and Radio, established under article 29 of the same 
act, which oversees regulation of public broadcast media. Concern has been expressed that 
neither body is free of interference from the Government.  
</p>
<p>52. In particular, given its role in the regulation of independent media, the composition 
of NTRC has been criticized. Under article 5 of the legislative regulations set out in 2001, 
NTRC is composed of nine members appointed directly by the President. Other comments 
on the NTRC have included OSCE&#8217;s criticism that the 2010 amendments to the Law on 
Broadcasting failed to ensure political and ideological pluralism of NTRC. In addition, the 
system of financing NTRC does not provide for an automatic guarantee of its financial 
independence from the State. In addition, there has been criticism of the transparency of 
broadcasting tender processes. Although legislation provides that NTRC can include 
independent experts in the tender processes, to date it has never done so. Serious concerns 
are expressed that these various issues undermine NTRC&#8217;s impartiality and integrity as an 
independent broadcast regulator.  
</p>
<p><b> IV.  Challenges faced by human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Overview of civil society in Armenia  
</b></p>
<p>53. In the course of her visit, the Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to engage 
actively with representatives of civil society in Armenia. Extensive consultations were held 
in the capital, Yerevan, during which human rights defenders were able to voice their 
concerns and share information with the mandate holder about the challenges they are 
currently facing. Human rights defenders in Armenia are active mostly in the field of civil 
and political rights but also in some areas of economic, social and cultural rights. Most 
NGOs are concentrated in the capital.  
</p>
<p>54. According to Government estimates, there are currently approximately 3,000 NGOs 
registered in Armenia. However, according to information received by the Special 
Rapporteur, only a small fraction of these organizations is actually active. Civil society 
appears to be deeply divided along political lines and is often characterized by apathy, 
disillusionment and frustration. The deep divisions experienced within civil society 
contribute to the problems and challenges faced by human rights defenders today, as 
independent human rights work and monitoring seems to be almost entirely impossible. 
NGOs and human rights defenders are quickly labelled according to their perceived

<p><b>A/HRC/16/44/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>political affiliation and categorized as either pro-Government or pro-opposition, leaving no 
neutral ground to carry out quality human rights work.  
</p>
<p>55. Civil society organizations appear to be largely dependent on donor funding. 
Additionally, civil society appears to consist primarily of NGOs; there appears to be a lack 
of trade unions, community organizations or similar entities.  
</p>
<p>56. The Government seems not to consider NGOs as potential partners, nor are they 
perceived by society as representative. Awareness about the activities of civil society 
organizations is also very low. The media often ignores NGO initiatives, reports and press 
conferences, and, furthermore, NGOs are frequently denied access to the media. The 
Special Rapporteur notes with serious concern that human rights defenders are regularly 
depicted in a distorted manner in State-controlled media and even smeared. Human rights 
defenders have been time and again labelled as foreign agents, spies, cronies and the &#8220;fifth 
column&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>57. While certain human rights defenders have experienced direct violence and assaults, 
especially in the aftermath of the 2008 Presidential elections, in the majority of the cases 
harassment and intimidation are carried out by more subtle and sophisticated methods, such 
as stigmatization by the media and certain politicians; smear campaigns; intrusive tax 
inspections; threatening phone calls; and pressure on donors.  
</p>
<p>58. As will be explained further, freedom of assembly remains particularly problematic 
for civil society in general, and for human rights defenders in particular, in Armenia.  
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur was also informed by several of her interlocutors that the 
right to access to information is often violated and the provisions of the relevant law are not 
implemented in practice.  
</p>
<p>60. Among the most vulnerable groups of human rights defenders in Armenia are those 
working of the rights of LGBT persons, women human rights defenders, NGOs working in 
remote areas and environmental activists.  
</p>
<p>61. Defenders working on the rights of LGBT persons frequently face hate speech by 
the media and verbal and physical abuse by representatives of law enforcement agencies. 
Intimidation of LGBT defenders is recurrent and it is felt that they are not understood even 
by some other parts of the civil society. There is a lack of awareness about issues related to 
LGBT persons in society in general, but also within civil society itself. Defenders working 
on LGBT issues are not able to register their organization as such, and are often forced to 
carry out their activities as human rights and sexual health organizations.  
</p>
<p>62. Women human rights defenders are scrutinized by the media and public opinion and 
frequently receive no support from their families. NGOs in the regions, especially in remote 
areas remain very rare and face severe difficulties in carrying out their work. 
Environmental activists receive threatening phone calls, are beaten by policemen and face 
prosecution for their activities.  
</p>
<p>63. Further challenges are faced by NGOs due to a lack of coordination between various 
donor organizations and agencies and the various regional and international organizations 
present in Armenia which often result in duplication of activities and efforts. The Special 
Rapporteur believes that a more coordinated approach which delivers coherent messages, 
would significantly contribute to enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of human 
rights NGOs in Armenia.  
</p>
<p>64. At the same time, the Special Rapporteur also wishes to highlight and commend best 
practices and positive examples, including the prison monitoring group formed in 2004 by 
the Ministry of Justice. The group is significant in that it is authorized to monitor and 
supervise the protection of human rights of persons in detention. The group has free access </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/44/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>to all penal institutions, may request information on the content of various documents, 
including the personal files and letters of prisoners, to examine the conditions at places of 
detention, and to have unrestricted, unsupervised access and contact to the detainees 
themselves. In 2006, a police monitoring group was established. NGOs nominate members 
of the group from among themselves. Members of the group are elected for a three-year 
term and work pro bono, receiving no State funding for the functioning of the group. There 
are 11 NGOs represented in the group. A similar monitoring group has been set up recently 
regarding closed pedagogical institutions for the mentally disabled.  
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur considers that networks (national, regional and 
international) of human rights defenders and NGOs not only contribute to a sense of 
solidarity between such organizations, but also significantly contribute to their effectiveness 
by exchanging strategies, challenges and practices,. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur 
commends initiatives such as the South Caucasus Network of Human Rights Defenders and 
encourages the expansion of membership of this and similar initiatives. Networks of human 
rights defenders are also important in raising the profile of defenders and contribute to 
enhancing their security and protection.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Illegitimate restrictions on freedom of association  
</b></p>
<p>66. Pursuant to article 28 of the Armenian Constitution, everyone has the right to create 
an association, trade union, or political party, and to be a member thereof. Limitations are 
placed on police officers, those serving in the military, members of the national security, 
prosecutor&#8217;s office, as well as on judges and members of the Constitutional Court.16. 
</p>
<p>67. The activities of NGOs in Armenia are regulated by the Law of the Republic of 
Armenia on Public Organizations, adopted on 4 December 2001.17 As stated, a draft NGO 
Law is currently being discussed and various NGO representatives met by the Special 
Rapporteur expressed concerns about the suggested amendments. 
</p>
<p>68. As previously stated, the Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that certain proposed 
amendments will further impede the activities of public organizations. Concerns about the 
proposed amendments relate mainly to the requirement of re-registration in case of change 
of address or change of the executive body of the organization thus contradicting the 
recommendations of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe (CM Rec 2007 
14) on the legal status of non-governmental organizations in Europe which stipulate that 
approval from the State is not required for changes to the statute of an organization, unless 
it concerns their name and objectives; to the requirement of providing 1,000 copies of the 
annual report of the organization, which could potentially create an extra burden on the 
finances of small organizations; and to the proposal that a failure to provide information as 
requested, the State authorized body will be able to convene a meeting. 
</p>
<p>69. Concerning the latter, in case of failure to provide information as requested by the 
new article 16, the State-authorized body may on its own initiative submit a request for 
convening a special meeting. If the special meeting is not convened within a month after 
the request is made, the requesting party (in this case the State authorized body) can go to 
court with a claim to convene a meeting. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the 
lack of clarity of this new provision and the risk that vesting the State authorized body with 
the power to request a meeting could lead to the dissolution of a human rights organization 
if the State-authorized body is dissatisfied with the information provided. 
</p>
<p>  
 16 Restrictions on freedom of association are outlined in arts. 44, 45 and 55 of the Constitution.

<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>70. In 2003, the Ministry of Justice tried to pass a Law on Foreign Grants.  This attempt 
of the Government was stopped, following public discussions with civil society and its 
sharp criticism. 
</p>
<p><b> C.  Impediments to the freedom of assembly 
</b></p>
<p>71. The right to freedom of assembly is enshrined in article 29 of the Constitution of the 
Republic of Armenia.18 After declaring independence in 1991, Armenia did not have a law 
regulating demonstrations and rallies. From 1995 on, article 29 of the Constitution applied. 
However, starting from the 1990s, the Yerevan City Administration prohibited on various 
grounds the demonstrations initiated by the opposition or NGOs, found them to be 
unauthorized and often applied administrative or criminal penalties in respect of the 
organizers and some participants. Since Armenia ratified the European Convention on 
Human Rights, several applications raising this issue were brought before the European 
Court of Human Rights.19 In several cases, the Court found a violation of article 11 of the 
Convention (freedom of assembly and association). 
</p>
<p>72. On 28 April 2004, following the mass opposition protest on 12 April 2004, and 
while the state of emergency was still ongoing, the Law on Conducting Meetings, 
Assemblies, Rallies and Demonstrations was adopted by the National Assembly.  The Law 
distinguishes between different types of assembly, namely mass public event, non-mass 
public event, spontaneous event and other event. 
</p>
<p>73. Pursuant to article 10 of the law, with the exception of spontaneous public events, 
mass public events may be held only after notifying the authorizing body in writing. The 
decision to prohibit conducting a mass public event may be appealed in court.  
</p>
<p>74. In March 2008, the National Assembly approved the last amendments to the law and 
the Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that certain provisions of the Draft Law still 
constitute unjustified and excessive restrictions to the freedom of assembly. In particular, 
article 9 states that a mass event could notably be prohibited if &#8220;there is credible 
information, according to which the event creates imminent threat of violence or poses a 
real threat to national security, the public order, the health and morals of the public, the life 
and health of persons, the constitutional rights and freedoms of others, or is conducted with 
the aim of forcibly overthrowing the constitutional order, inciting ethnic, racial, or religious 
hatred, or preaching violence or war, or may result in mass disorder, or inflict significant 
property damage to the State, a community, or natural or legal persons. Such information 
may be deemed credible, if an official substantiated opinion thereon has been submitted by 
the Republic of Armenia by the Police or National Security Service. In the same manner, 
these bodies issue an opinion on the termination of such grounds&#8221;. The vagueness of this 
article as well as the fact that what could constitute credible information is that which the 
police or the National Security Service confirm as such justifying the prohibition of a mass 
event may be used to unduly restrict defenders&#8217; right to assemble. Furthermore, the 
provision does not say whether the credible information would be accessible to the 
organizer of the demonstration and whether it would be subject to appeal. Moreover, the 
</p>
<p>  
 18 Restrictions may apply pursuant to article 43 of the Constitution. 
 19 See <i>Mkrtchyan v. Armenia </i>(Application no. 6562/03), Judgment, 11 January 2007; <i>Galstyan v. 
</i></p>
<p><i>Armenia</i> (application no. 26986/03), Judgment, 15 November 2007; <i>Ashughyan v. Armenia 
</i>(application no. 33268/03), Judgment, 17 July 2008. In all three cases, the European Court of Human 
Rights found a violation of Article 11 of the European Convention (right to freedom of peaceful 
assembly). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/44/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur is concerned that the application in practice of some of the amended 
provision(s) relating to spontaneous assemblies is still problematic. 
</p>
<p><b>  Restrictions on demonstrations and rental of meeting spaces 
</b></p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur is concerned by restrictions on gatherings in public spaces. 
According to various persons met by the Special Rapporteur, within the past three years, 
several applications to hold rallies, notably in Freedom Square, Yerevan were rejected.  
</p>
<p>76. Although gatherings of less than 100 participants do not legally require 
authorization, only notification, in practice the right to peaceful assembly is often denied or 
interfered with. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur was told that since the March 2008 
events, defenders&#8217; freedom of assembly had been reduced.  
</p>
<p>77. In particular, peaceful demonstrators have been systematically followed and 
provoked by the police. Many defenders who periodically assemble to ask for impartial 
investigation into the events of March 2008 are verbally harassed by the police during their 
demonstrations. These allegations of provocation by the police during authorized rallies 
were, however, denied by the police. 
</p>
<p>78. Similarly, indoor gatherings have been hindered since March 2008, and the 
difficulties experienced by NGOs in renting meeting space appear to be systematic. Many 
NGOs attempting to organize events in venues such as hotel conference rooms have been 
refused due to unavailability. In the year 2009 alone, five such instances were reported to 
the Special Rapporteur. The justification was that owners of such conferences halls in 
Yerevan have allegedly been reluctant to rent out their facilities to avoid any problems. 
However, it was reported that hotel employees had to get approval from the State for each 
request for hall rental made by certain organizations. The Special Rapporteur is concerned 
about such instances of non-State actors impeding the freedoms of defenders for unknown 
and unjustifiable reasons.  
</p>
<p>79. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that the current restrictions may be 
tightened in the years to come, especially before, during and after the next Parliamentary 
elections in 2012. As identified by the Special Rapporteur in her thematic report to the 
thirteenth session of the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/13/22), human rights defenders 
are often most vulnerable in the run-up to, during and directly after elections. Special 
efforts need to be made to ensure that the rights and freedoms provided by international 
human rights instruments and national legislation are not unduly restricted during election 
periods. The Special Rapporteur recalls her recommendations in this regard (ibid., para. 
56). 
</p>
<p><b> D.  Restrictions on the freedom of expression  
</b></p>
<p>80. During her mission the Special Rapporteur met with various representatives of the 
media. It was noted that freedom of expression is nominally respected in Armenia. 
However, the Special Rapporteur is disturbed regarding reports of violence and attacks 
against journalists, with the overall impression of a climate of self-censorship, particularly 
concerning sensitive issues. In addition, the Special Rapporteur is dismayed regarding 
reports of judicial harassment, governmental restrictions, other forms of &#8220;informal 
pressure&#8221;, and the lack of independent news media in the country.  
</p>
<p>81. Journalists appear to be most at risk when working on civil and political issues, 
adopting a critical stance against the authorities, or reporting on issues which may affect 
vested interests, such as corruption. It was reported that journalists have been violently 
attacked in the past two years. The Special Rapporteur expresses particular dismay 
regarding reports of the failure of the police and judiciary to investigate such incidents and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/44/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>bring perpetrators to justice, leading to a prevailing trend of impunity for human rights 
violations which further encourages a cycle of self-censorship and reluctance to engage in 
investigative and human rights reporting.  
</p>
<p>82. Instances of violence against journalists include an attack against Edik 
Baghdasaryan, Chair of the Armenian Association of Investigative Journalists and editor of 
the on-line magazine HetqOnline. On 17 November 2008, Mr. Baghdasaryan was attacked 
by three unknown assailants as he was getting into his car, hitting him over the back of his 
head with a blunt object. Although the Armenian authorities condemned the attack and a 
criminal investigation was promptly opened, serious shortcomings in the investigations 
were reported: only one of three perpetrators was brought to trial, while the other two were 
released due to the lack of sufficient evidence. 
</p>
<p>83. On 24 February 2010, a photojournalist working for the newspaper<i> Aravot</i> was on 
duty at the Office of the Prosecutor when a man approached him and told him to stop taking 
photographs. When the photographer refused and produced his press identification, the man 
began to physically and verbally abuse him. This incident was captured on film and posted 
online, and the perpetrator was later identified as an investigator working in the Special 
Investigation Service of the Army and Police. An investigation into the incident was 
opened, but investigators later announced their conclusion that the photographer had 
assaulted the investigator, who had been trying to appease him. In addition, it was reported 
that the journalist had lodged a false claim with the Office of the Prosecutor in relation to 
the case.  
</p>
<p>84. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned that there may be a correlation 
between violence against reporters and recent political events in the country. For example, 
six documented incidents of assault and harassment of journalists took place during the 
2009 Yerevan Municipal Elections. This included threats, physical and verbal assaults and 
journalists being prevented from entering polling stations, taking pictures, or carrying out 
other duties on 31 May 2009. Some of these instances were reported to the authorities but 
no action was taken in response.  
</p>
<p>85. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention was drawn to the concentration of independent 
media in the Yerevan area with the result that self-censorship, interference in media 
freedom and intimidation are more prevalent in the regions. Journalists in regional and rural 
areas are reportedly more reluctant to engage in investigative journalism or report on issues 
which may affect those with vested interests, and are equally more vulnerable to violence, 
intimidation or other forms of informal pressure.   
</p>
<p>86. Furthermore, several representatives of civil society interviewed by the Special 
Rapporteur described their difficulty in getting media attention regarding their human rights 
activities. For example, reports and publications issued by human rights organizations were 
not publicized or reported on by the media, and press conferences are poorly attended. It is 
believed that this may relate to the practice of self-censorship by news outlets.  
</p>
<p>87. The Special Rapporteur commends the National Assembly for its adoption on 18 
May 2010 of amendments to the Armenian Criminal and Civil Codes, decriminalizing 
defamation and removing imprisonment from the list of penalties for insult, libel or slander. 
However, serious misgivings are expressed regarding the amendments&#8217; introduction of high 
monetary fines for slander through civil suits, primarily to be imposed upon media outlets. 
In addition, definitions of &#8220;insult&#8221; and &#8220;libel&#8221; contained in the provisions are considered 
overly vague, while legal matters such as permissible defences are not clarified by the 
legislative amendments.20 Although criminal prosecution for defamation was relatively rare 
</p>
<p>  
 20 See OSCE, &#8220;Analysis of the Draft Laws Amending the Defamation Legislation in the Republic of 
 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/44/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>under the previous legal provisions, civil suits filed against media organizations in recent 
years indicate a pattern of stigmatization and financial punishment of critical or 
investigative reporters. It is feared that the new provisions do not contain sufficient 
procedural safeguards for freedom of expression, and that they may be used restrictively 
against independent reporting.  
</p>
<p>88. The Special Rapporteur also expresses her dismay regarding the introduction to law 
on 17 June 2010 of amendments to Armenia&#8217;s Law on Radio and Television. Both local 
human rights defenders and members of the international community &#8211; including the OSCE 
Representative on Freedom of the Media and the European Union delegation in Armenia, 
among others &#8211; have expressed their belief that these amendments will allow the 
Government to reduce plurality of the media and prevent the emergence of independent 
broadcasting.  
</p>
<p>89. The amendments extend a suspension of the issuance of new broadcasting licenses, 
which was introduced in 2008 until a process of digitalization of broadcast frequencies is 
completed, with the effect of limiting the number of TV channels on the air in Armenia. 
The amendments are characterized by a lack of clear guidelines and rules for licensing 
procedures as well as the regulation of broadcasting by the regulating body, the National 
Television and Radio Commission (NTRC). In addition, provisions have been added 
specifying the content that channels may broadcast.21 The Government claims to have 
accepted most of the recommendations made by the OSCE on the proposed bill.22 However, 
the Special Rapporteur regrets that many key provisions of the bill were not altered before 
it was signed into law, and that an opportunity was lost to engage in this regard with 
international experts in the field. 
</p>
<p>90. The new legislative provisions are particularly worrying, given that it appears that 
few media outlets in Armenia are independently operated. Although print media enjoys a 
high degree of freedom &#8211; in contrast to broadcast media -- most publications are aligned 
with various political groups. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the politicization of civil 
society thus appears to affect the press, with the effect that little news is impartially 
reported or published.

<p>91. The case of TV channel A1+ is seen as emblematic of governmental restrictions on 
freedom of the press. In 2002, independent TV channel A1+ was closed under the NTRC&#8217;s 
mandatory broadcast licensing mechanism. Since then, A1+ has been repeatedly denied a 
renewal of its broadcast license. In 2008, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that 
the denial of service to A1+ was in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights, 
and fined the Government of Armenia &#8364;30,000, although it did not order the authorities to 
grant A1+ a license to broadcast.23 To date A1+ remains off the air but continues its 
campaign against the NTRC&#8217;s decisions while maintaining an online presence.  
</p>
<p>92. However, the 2010 amendments also grant NTRC power to enforce regulation of 
mobile and Internet-provided broadcasting, despite the lack of prior legislation providing 
for the regulation of these areas. It is thus feared that this may affect the ability of A1+ to

<p>carry out Web broadcasts in lieu of TV broadcasting. It has been stated with regard to the 
2010 amendments that, &#8220;these norms compromising legal certainty seem to be not an 
incidental omission but a deliberate attempt to put all forms and types of audiovisual media 
services under strict regime of licensing (or permissions) of the NTRC and subject them to 
bureaucratic scrutiny and discretion&#8221;.24 
</p>
<p>93. Many stakeholders expressed great pessimism to the Special Rapporteur regarding 
the impact on Armenian media of the amendments to the Law on Radio and Television, 
with many fearing that freedom of the press and of the right to freedom of expression 
would be irreversibly damaged. Furthermore, several stakeholders expressed their belief 
that governmental restrictions on the media, such as the broadcasting amendments, were 
damaging public trust and interest in news reporting in general.   
</p>
<p><b> E. Impunity for abuses against defenders  
</b></p>
<p>94. A major concern conveyed by human rights defenders to the Special Rapporteur is 
the question of impunity for violations committed against human rights defenders and 
journalists. A culture of impunity is deeply rooted in Armenian society and the law 
enforcement and legal systems.  
</p>
<p>95. One of the fundamental concerns frequently raised with the Special Rapporteur is 
the impunity surrounding the events of March 2008. According to information received, 
only two policemen have been charged so far and no one has been convicted.  
</p>
<p>96. Violence against journalists and human rights defenders frequently goes unpunished, 
with the police being reluctant, in some cases, to open investigations. Even in cases where 
investigations are opened, they are inconclusive and do not lead to prosecutions. Impunity 
for violations against human rights defenders and journalists has often led to further self-
censorship.  
</p>
<p>97. The lack of public and political accountability was often noted in discussions with 
the Special Rapporteur. Society in general has a rather low level of trust both in the police 
and the judiciary. Widespread corruption adds to the perception of impunity. The Special 
Rapporteur wishes to acknowledge the efforts of the Government to crack down on 
corruption and increase the effectiveness of the police and the independence of the 
judiciary. The integrated anti-corruption programme is a right step in this direction. At the 
same time, the Special Rapporteur strongly stresses that the programme must be 
implemented in its entirety. The quality of investigations and prosecutions is believed to be 
sub-standard and needs to be enhanced urgently.  
</p>
<p>98. As noted, the apparent culture of impunity is closely related to deep-rooted problems 
within the police system and shortcomings of the justice system. The Special Rapporteur 
notes with serious concern that decisions of the Constitutional Court are frequently 
unheeded and that judgements of the European Court of Human Rights are very often not 
implemented.  
</p>
<p>99. On 21 May 2008, Mikael Danielyan, the head of the local Helsinki Association, was 
assaulted by and shot at by a person who was known to the authorities and whose identity 
was confirmed by eyewitnesses. The charges against the alleged perpetrator were dismissed 
and Mr. Danielyan was not recognized as the victim of the assault. According to 
information provided by the Government after the visit, during the preliminary

<p>investigation phase into the incident, several witnesses had been interrogated, forensic 
medical investigation had been launched and the police department received instructions to 
reveal the exact circumstances of the case. The Government further reported that the 
evidence acquired during the investigation did not reveal any connection between the 
assault and the human rights or other professional activities of Mr. Danielyan.  
</p>
<p>100. Mariam Sukhudian, an environmental activist and whistle-blower who reported on 
instances of sexual abuse committed against children in a boarding school, was initially 
charged with perjury, later downgraded to slander. The attention of the investigation and 
prosecution focused initially mainly on Ms. Sukhudian, instead of the alleged perpetrator of 
the abuses. According to the information provided by the Government after the visit, the 
criminal pursuit against Ms. Sukhudian was terminated. Moreover, a criminal case was 
initiated on the acts of child abuse against a former teacher in the boarding school who has 
been convicted and sentenced to two years of imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>101. The tragic events following the 2008 Presidential elections constitute another 
example of violations which have not been duly investigated. Investigations need to be 
undertaken with a view to ensuring meaningful and effective prosecution in compliance 
with international legal standards, including the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders.  
The Special Rapporteur wishes to stress that prompt, thorough and impartial investigations 
of all human rights violations are crucial to create a safe and enabling environment in which 
human rights defenders can carry out their activities.  
</p>
<p><b> V.  Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>Despite the creation of the Office of the Ombudsperson and the establishment 
of the existing legal framework, human rights defenders operate in a difficult 
environment in Armenia.  
</b></p>
<p>103.<b> The recently adopted and proposed amendments to the existing legislative 
framework, notably the NGO Law and the amendments to the Law on Broadcasting, 
constitute regressive developments, and will obstruct the activities of human rights 
defenders. Hindrances to the right to freedom of assembly and to freedom of 
expression by Armenian law enforcement officers as well as private actors are also of 
concern to the Special Rapporteur. In particular, the Special Rapporteur is disturbed 
regarding reports of violence against human rights defenders, in particular 
journalists, and of a failure to fully and thoroughly investigate and prosecute such 
incidents.  
</b></p>
<p>104.<b> The events of March 2008 have contributed to a very politicized environment in 
Armenia, preventing constructive cooperation between the authorities, the 
Ombudsperson and human rights defenders. In addition, continuing impunity for the 
alleged violations committed during this period further contribute to a climate of 
suspicion between different actors within civil society and within Armenian society in 
general. The Special Rapporteur hopes that her visit and report will create 
momentum for better cooperation between the authorities and Armenian civil society, 
and recalls the urgent necessity to ensure the accountability of those responsible for 
the abuses during the 2008 events in order to move towards a safer environment for 
all human rights defenders. In particular, bearing in mind the invaluable contribution 
that committed leadership can provide towards the national reconciliation required to 
overcome these divisions, the Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate a request 
she made to the Prime Minister during her meeting with him to publicly acknowledge </b></p>

<p>105.<b> The Special Rapporteur looks forward to a continued constructive dialogue 
with the Government on the situation of human rights defenders in all parts of the 
country. She calls on the United Nations agencies, donors and other international 
actors to improve their cooperation not only with civil society and in particular 
human rights defenders, but also with each other. The Special Rapporteur reminds 
the Government of Armenia of its human rights obligations and in particular calls 
upon it to fully implement the recommendations formulated during the universal 
periodic review.
