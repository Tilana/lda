<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its eleventh session from 2 
to 13 May 2011. The review of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was held at the 13th 
meeting on 10 May 2011. The delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was headed 
by Camillo M. Gonsalves, Permanent Representative of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 
to the United Nations. At its 17th meeting, held on 13 May 2011, the Working Group 
adopted the report on Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. 
</p>
<p>2. On 21 June 2010, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines: Argentina, 
Malaysia and Norway.  
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted and a written presentation made in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/11/VCT/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/VCT/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/VCT/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, 
Latvia, Maldives, the Netherlands, Slovenia and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland was transmitted to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines through the troika. 
These questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b>I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines welcomed the opportunity to participate in the 
universal periodic review, and to engage in dialogue with members of the international 
community on the human rights record and accomplishments of the State. The delegation 
viewed the dialogue as an important opportunity to identify the areas for improvement and 
international priority, while simultaneously allowing the Human Rights Council to learn 
about the context, beliefs and perspectives of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. 
</p>
<p>6. The delegation noted that development of human rights in Saint Vincent and the 
Grenadines, and its national approaches in that regard, were informed by the State&#8217;s unique 
historical, physical, political and socio-economic characteristics. Saint Vincent and the 
Grenadines was an archipelago of over 32 islands, with roughly 110,000 citizens. Those 
citizens were highly migratory people, with a high proportion living and working in other 
States.  
</p>
<p>7. The human rights history of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines had been shaped in 
part by slavery, colonialism and the genocide of its indigenous peoples. Slavery had been 
introduced by colonial powers, which also had participated in the extermination and exile 
of the indigenous Garifuna people. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines noted that, in modern 
times, it had largely solved many of the ethnic and racial tensions that bedevilled other </p>


<p>States. The descendants of the slaveholders, the enslaved and the indigenous lived in peace 
and relative harmony with each other and with the more recent immigrants from Asia, the 
Middle East and Europe.  
</p>
<p>8. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was a plural and fully inclusive participatory 
democracy. Since independence in 1979, it had enjoyed eight free and fair elections and 
three peaceful transfers of power between opposing political parties. The delegation 
indicated that the country was host to a boisterous free press &#8211; including some media outlets 
that were highly critical of the Government &#8211; and a lively and largely unregulated Internet 
blogosphere. Freedom of expression and assembly was constitutionally protected and 
actively practiced in a variety of contexts. Women, youth and various racial and ethnic 
groups played strong roles in successive Governments of the country. 
</p>
<p>9. The national Constitution had been adopted in 1979, and had been largely 
unchanged since then. The Constitution explicitly protected the rights to life, to personal 
liberty, and to the freedoms of conscience, expression, assembly, association and 
movement. The Constitution also provided protection from slavery and forced labour, 
inhuman treatment, deprivation of property, arbitrary search and entry, and discrimination 
on the grounds of sex, race, place of origin, political opinions, colour or creed, and it 
secured the protection of the law, including the right to a fair hearing and the presumption 
of innocence. 
</p>
<p>10. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines unsuccessfully attempted to reform its 
Constitution in 2009 via a referendum. The proposed constitution was the product of 
extensive consultations with all stakeholders. It contained a number of innovations and 
advancements in governance and human rights, including rights relating to employment, 
political participation, protection of the environment, heritage and culture. The elderly, 
youth, women, teachers and the press also were to receive additional constitutional 
recognition and protection. The proposed document would have provided for the creation of 
a human rights commission and an ombudsman, among other bodies. Unfortunately, the 
bipartisan effort on constitutional reform had been derailed by political considerations in 
the lead-up to scheduled elections in 2010, which had contributed to the failure of the 
referendum. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines had accepted the results of the referendum. 
</p>
<p>11. Like many other Caribbean Community States, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 
acknowledged its tardiness in meeting certain reporting commitments under the treaties to 
which it was a party. The tardiness was a product of practical constraints, not an absence of 
political will or a diminished commitment to human rights. The preparation for the UPR 
process had highlighted the fact that Saint Vincent and the Grenadines had been tardy in 
meeting some of its reporting commitments, and one tangible benefit of the UPR was that it 
had caused the Government to revisit the manner in which Saint Vincent and the 
Grenadines prepared for and responded to its treaty commitments. The Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs had dedicated legal staff to coordinate the national responses in a more systematic 
manner and would form a multisectoral committee to review and expedite compliance with 
its outstanding commitments. In that regard, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines welcomed 
any technical or capacity-building assistance that might be offered. 
</p>
<p>12. In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, the enhancement of human rights was not a 
sterile legislative process. Rather, it was a holistic approach that was responsive to the 
needs and demands of its citizens. While it is critical that universal human rights are 
enjoyed universally, it is often necessary for poor countries to prioritize the legislative 
means by which such rights are formally recognized. The State&#8217;s serious commitment to 
human rights did not allow for a &#8220;checklist approach&#8221; or a cosmetic response to legislation. 
Instead, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines adopted a more forward-looking and positive 
legislative stance, coupled with a respect for the ability of its courts and common law </p>


<p>system to shape legal precedent and constitutional interpretation in such a way as to reflect 
evolving understandings of human rights. 
</p>
<p>13. The adoption of a human-rights based culture required overlapping approaches, the 
engagement of civil society and an analysis of regional best practices within a conducive 
environment of public debate. 
</p>
<p>14. The delegation reported that human rights were part and parcel of the Government&#8217;s 
broader developmental thrust and focus. Given the relationship between development and 
human rights, the advancement of such rights and a rights-based culture were inextricably 
linked to continued development. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, recognizing the 
twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration on the Right to Development, reemphasized its 
belief that development is a human right. The establishment and advancement of all 
universal human rights were viewed through this developmental prism. Accordingly, 
significant investments and marked improvements had been achieved in the areas of 
housing, health, education, economic development, poverty reduction, and assistance to the 
elderly, youth and prison populations. 
</p>
<p>15. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines could reflect with some pride on its rapidly 
developing and improving post-independence human rights record. Nonetheless, there was 
significant room for improvement. The right of persons with disabilities to be fully 
integrated in society still left much to be desired, as did the continued stigmatization of 
persons living with HIV/AIDS. There was ongoing concern with violence against women 
and the sexual abuse of minors. An unwelcome increase in political tribalism had spurred 
the creation of the Ministry of National Reconciliation. 
</p>
<p>16. The delegation referred to climate change as a real and immediate threat to the rights 
to life, to property and to development. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>17. During the interactive dialogue, 33 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report.  
</p>
<p>18.<b> </b>Algeria commended efforts in the areas of the promotion of the right to housing for 
economically disadvantaged persons, the right to education, literacy and the protection of 
childhood. It also noted that efforts in the area of health had contributed to improve the life 
expectancy of the population. It expressed solidarity with the efforts to address poverty, 
drug trafficking and criminality and the effects that the international trade system had had 
on employment. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>19.<b> </b>Cuba<b> </b>commended Saint Vincent and the Grenadines for its programmes to combat 
poverty and to prioritize education, promoting universal education at all levels, as well as 
for its programmes in the area of health and the prevention of HIV/AIDS. Cuba also made 
reference to efforts undertaken to address the rights of children, women, and persons with 
disabilities and with respect to social security. Cuba made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>20.<b> </b>The United Kingdom acknowledged the commitment of Saint Vincent and the 
Grenadines to human rights and non-discrimination and the progress it has made to ensure 
the rights of all its citizens were respected despite its challenges as a small island. It noted 
efforts in addressing child abuse and the introduction of the National Child Abuse Register. 
It inquired about plans to provide safe and secure facilities for juveniles who had 
committed criminal offences, in keeping with its obligations under the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child. The United Kingdom encouraged Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to 
improve transparency in the system of complaints against officials in the justice and 
security sectors. It made recommendations. </p>


<p>21.<b> </b>Brazil congratulated Saint Vincent and the Grenadines for its engagement in the 
universal periodic review. It noted with appreciation progress made in the areas of health 
and education. Brazil asked the delegation how its Government intended to address the 
concerns of the Committee on the Rights of the Child in relation to discrimination against 
children, especially those belonging to minorities and those with disabilities. Brazil 
expressed concern about the persistent use of corporal punishment in schools and the very 
low age applied to criminal responsibility. It also noted with concern the high incidence of 
violence against women, in particular domestic violence, and the lack of legal and policy 
instruments to address it. Brazil made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>22.<b> </b>Malaysia acknowledged the geographical, economic and environmental challenges 
to improving the socio-economic situation of its people, which could affect negatively the 
enjoyment of the full range of human rights on the ground. Malaysia noted the emphasis 
that Saint Vincent and the Grenadines placed on education, aiming at making education at 
all levels more accessible to a larger section of the population. It noted with appreciation 
the country&#8217;s commitment to ease the financial and economic burdens of the population 
through social security measures. Malaysia made recommendations.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>23. Austria noted the consultations with civil society that Saint Vincent and the 
Grenadines had undertaken in the preparation of its national report. Austria referred to the 
country&#8217;s delays in complying with its reporting obligations to treaty bodies. It also 
expressed concern about the continued existence of the death penalty in the country&#8217;s legal 
system. Austria expressed concern about the situation in prisons, especially due to 
overcrowding. It commended the Government&#8217;s efforts to address that issue. Austria asked 
about the timeline of the project to build a new prison, and asked about other planned steps 
to improve conditions of detention. It also asked for an explanation of the high ratio of 
incarceration in relation to the country&#8217;s overall population. Austria made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>24.<b> </b>The United States of America<b> </b>commended Saint Vincent and the Grenadines for its 
attention to combating discrimination against persons with disabilities. It welcomed the 
ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and encouraged the 
country to implement it effectively. The United States remained concerned at the continued 
reports of violence against women, which was not specifically criminalized in the law, and 
noted that in many instances domestic violence went unpunished. The United States also 
remained concerned that homosexual acts were illegal under certain statutes. It made 
recommendations.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>25.<b> </b>Belgium commended the adoption of a specific law on corporal punishment of 
minors but regretted that the law still authorized beating with a stick, in violation of the 
prohibition of cruel, inhuman and degrading punishments under article 7 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It noted that beating with a stick was 
widespread in institutions such as schools, in the administration of justice and within the 
family. It restated that Belgium advocated for the abolition of capital punishment as it had 
been proven that capital punishment had no deterrent effect and led to many errors and 
abuses. It made recommendations.<b>  
</b></p>
<p>26.<b> </b>Norway noted the retention by Saint Vincent and the Grenadines of the death 
penalty, but welcomed the fact that there had been no executions for more than 10 years. It 
raised concern about the reports of violence against women. Norway welcomed the 
commitment to principles of equality and non-discrimination, the measures taken to address 
and reduce rates of HIV/AIDS, and the efforts to bridge the gap between prevention and 
support services. It noted the criminal provisions prohibiting sexual relations between 
consenting adults of the same sex. Norway made recommendations. </p>


<p>27.<b> </b>Nicaragua commended the delegation for progress made in the areas of education, 
health, housing and work. It also welcomed the actions taken to build an egalitarian society, 
in which there was an awareness that discrimination and exclusion needed to be eradicated 
from the society and in which women played an important role. Nicaragua also referred to 
efforts needed to address poverty. Nicaragua made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>28. France noted that the death penalty was still enshrined in the legislation, even 
though there had been no execution since 1997. It also noted that violence against women 
remained an issue of concern. It inquired about measures envisaged to prevent sexual 
exploitation of children and to assist and reintegrate child victims of such exploitation in 
accordance with recommendations made by the Committee on the Rights of the Child. It 
also inquired whether the recommendations of the Committee on the Rights of the Child 
calling for a study on the scope of the phenomenon of street children had been 
implemented. It noted that section 146 of the Penal Code criminalized sexual relations 
between consenting adults of the same sex. It made recommendations.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>29. In response to comments and additional questions, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 
indicated that its national legislation included a variety of provisions that dealt with sexual 
activity between consenting adults. Existing legislation against incest, prostitution, public 
indecency, same-sex acts and buggery all enjoyed wide popular support in the State and 
there was no legislative support for repealing any of these provisions. To the extent that 
recommendations were specifically targeted to consensual sex between members of the 
same sex, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines noted that its legislation on buggery was 
inherited from the United Kingdom, whose Buggery Act and Offences against the Person 
Act both pre-dated the local legislation. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines noted the 
hundreds of years that it took for the United Kingdom to repeal similar legislation, and the 
harsh nature of the sentences imposed under British law, and compared them to the 
relatively short period of time that Saint Vincent and the Grenadines had been an 
independent State, and the less punitive sanctions involved. In the context of the moral, 
societal and cultural make-up of the State, there was currently no desire to revisit that 
legislation. 
</p>
<p>30. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was concerned with all instances of violence 
against women and domestic violence. Work was being done to strengthen the existing 
Domestic Violence Act. Additionally, the Police Service had been receiving special training 
to help officers to be more sensitive in dealing with issues of domestic violence. Similarly, 
the police had been receiving additional training to show greater sensitivity to prevent 
instances of excessive force. 
</p>
<p>31. The delegation recognized the existence of corporal punishment of juveniles 
although the legislation constrained the instances in which corporal punishment could be 
used in juveniles. There were very strict child abuse laws and no one could recall the last 
time that corporal punishment had actually been carried out as part of a criminal sentence. 
</p>
<p>32. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines cited its unsuccessful attempt to revise its 
Constitution via a referendum as an example of the seriousness with which it approached 
changes in legislation that affected the rights of citizens. That process had involved years of 
consultation with civil society, radio and television programmes, and meetings with citizens 
both locally and in the diaspora. 
</p>
<p>33. Regarding prison overcrowding, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines indicated that a 
new correctional facility had been constructed, and that transfers of prisoners would 
commence in June 2011. The national rate of incarceration was not unduly high. Using a 
measure of prisoners per 100,000 persons was statistically misleading in a country whose 
population was just slightly over 100,000. Also, consideration should be paid not only to 
the rate of incarceration but to the length of sentences imposed. </p>


<p>34. Regarding street children, the delegation referred to the existence of a rehabilitation 
project and a pilot programme to get those children back to school and reconcile them with 
their parents, and to the investment in improving facilities for children who did not have a 
home. 
</p>
<p>35. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines noted that it had voted against United Nations 
resolutions calling for a moratorium on the death penalty as such resolutions were 
inconsistent with existing national legislation. However, although the specific legislation on 
the death penalty had not been amended, a series of judicial rulings had limited the scope 
and applicability of capital punishment in the national context. Courts had removed the 
death penalty as a mandatory sentence, and had reserved capital punishment for only the 
most heinous crimes. Additionally, persons who had been on death row for over five years 
had their sentences commuted to life in prison. Since it was not currently possible for a 
prisoner to exhaust his appeals in a five-year period, it was not possible in practice to 
impose the death penalty, which had not been exercised since 1995. The delegation 
encouraged States with civil law jurisdictions to consider the ways in which judicial 
precedent could alter the applicability of legislation in common law jurisdictions. 
</p>
<p>36. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines welcomed the focus of many States&#8217; comments on 
the right to development and their recognition of its efforts in that regard. Development was 
viewed as a means by which other human rights could be further enhanced. In turn, 
education was the key to national development. The State had therefore invested heavily in 
improving preschool, primary and tertiary education in recent years. Saint Vincent and the 
Grenadines expressed its gratitude to States that had assisted the country with its national 
development efforts. 
</p>
<p>37. Honduras congratulated Saint Vincent and the Grenadines for the support provided 
for the creation of the foundation to promote the cultural heritage of the Garifuna people. 
While aware of the efforts and initiatives for the promotion and protection of human rights, 
Honduras expressed concern about gender violence and the opportunities of children and 
adolescents to education. It asked if the country had considered extending an open and 
standing invitation to the United Nations special procedures mechanisms. Honduras made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. Spain congratulated Saint Vincent and the Grenadines for the initiatives taken to 
combat HIV/AIDS and encouraged it to continue its efforts in this area. Spain also 
welcomed the programme of action in cooperation with the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund 
(UNICEF) for 2008-2011. Spain noted the efforts to build a new State prison and 
encouraged the country to take measures to end overcrowding and address the conditions of 
prisoners. Spain made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>39. South Africa welcomed the focus placed on poverty reduction. It also commended 
the focus on economic growth, job creation, education, health, social security and 
infrastructure development. South Africa encouraged Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to 
see to it that that the policies aimed at poverty reduction were allocated the necessary 
resources to ensure that they were effectively implemented. South Africa asked the 
delegation to provide further information on racial discrimination affecting children and the 
steps being taken to combat and prevent all discrimination against children. South Africa 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>40. Slovenia commended the determination of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to 
alleviate poverty and to empower the people by improving the educational system. It 
welcomed the country&#8217;s efforts to combat HIV/AIDS. Slovenia inquired about measures 
taken by Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to improve food security, especially for 
children. Slovenia made recommendations. </p>


<p>41. Thailand shared the views, reflected in the national report, that poverty reduction 
and sustainable growth are part and parcel of enhancing good governance and contribute to 
the promotion and protection of human rights in the long run. It indicated that it stood ready 
to cooperate and exchange best practices with Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in areas 
such as socio-economic development and health. Thailand noted with appreciation the 
improvement of the correctional facilities and referred to the United Nations Rules for the 
Treatment of Women Prisoners and Non-custodial Measures for Women Offenders adopted 
by the General Assembly in 2010. Thailand made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. Australia welcomed the protection given by Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to the 
rights of women, children, and persons with disabilities and the efforts to advance the 
economic and social rights of its citizens, including through equality of opportunity in 
education. It was concerned by continuing reports of unwarranted police practices, 
including the use of excessive force, and urged Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to 
thoroughly investigate complaints from citizens about assault or other abuse by the police. 
It welcomed the de facto moratorium on the death penalty and encouraged the country to 
remove the death penalty from its laws. Australia made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>43. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela noted the efforts made by Saint Vincent and 
the Grenadines in the drafting of the national report under the universal periodic review 
mechanism, which reflected the country&#8217;s commitment to human rights. It highlighted 
efforts made by the country in the area of economic, social and cultural rights, in particular 
relating to the right to education. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>44. Germany commended the achievements Saint Vincent and the Grenadines had made 
in the area of human rights. Germany inquired about plans to address the issue of the age of 
criminal responsibility, fixed at 8 years of age, recalling that in 2002 the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child had noted that it was too low and that juvenile justice protection was not 
afforded to all persons under the age of 18. It asked for information on how the 
Government intended to secure children&#8217;s rights in national legislation. Germany made 
reference to the concern expressed by the Human Rights Committee in 2008 that 
consensual acts between adults in private were still criminalized under section 146 of the 
Criminal Code. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>45. Mexico welcomed efforts to strengthen the legal and institutional framework for the 
protection of all persons in the country. It noted measures in the areas of administration of 
justice, empowerment of women and legislative reforms, in particular to address gender 
discrimination and slavery. Mexico reiterated its support in the area of security and 
education and hoped that that bilateral cooperation would soon lead to a better human rights 
situation in the country. Mexico made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>46. Hungary noted the programmes Saint Vincent and the Grenadines had implemented 
in the areas of good governance, poverty reduction, socio-economic development and 
education. It was concerned about the country&#8217;s vote against the adoption of General 
Assembly resolution 62/149 on a moratorium on the death penalty. Hungary acknowledged 
climate change challenges, including the full enjoyment of the right to food and health. 
Hungary encouraged the Government to further strengthen its work with human rights 
NGOs and its cooperation with human rights mechanisms, including the implementation of 
UPR recommendations. Hungary made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>47. Uruguay recognized efforts made by Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, in particular 
in the area of poverty, in a context of vulnerability due to, inter alia, the effects of climate 
change and natural disasters. It welcomed efforts to prevent the abuse of children and to 
implement youth programmes with UNICEF. Uruguay referred to the regular use of 
corporal punishment of children and the legal framework, as well as to the age of criminal 
responsibility currently being 8 years. Uruguay made recommendations. </p>


<p>48. Canada took note of the human rights commitment shown by Saint Vincent and the 
Grenadines. Canada was concerned at the challenges faced in protecting juveniles in the 
legal system; at the poor prison conditions, mistreatment, corruption by guards and the 
uncontrolled presence of weapons and drugs; at the legal sanctions and discrimination 
based on sexual orientation and gender identity; and at the death penalty. Canada made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>49. Maldives referred to the challenges faced by Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in the 
promotion and protection of human rights due to its small size and its capacity constraints, 
and indicated that the Working Group should understand and appreciate that during the 
review. It noted that, despite its development challenges, the country had made important 
progress across key indicators, including health, education, poverty eradication and child 
and disability rights. Maldives made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>50.<b> </b>Slovakia commended Saint Vincent and the Grenadines for its ratification of the 
main human rights instruments and noted the Constitutional provision on redress for 
victims of human rights violations. It noted the country&#8217;s efforts towards sustainable growth 
and poverty eradication. Slovakia also noted with appreciation steps taken towards the 
improvement of the country&#8217;s judicial administration. It commended the de facto 
moratorium, in place since 1997, on capital punishment. It expressed concern about 
reported complaints against unwarranted police practices, such as excessive use of force 
and a high ratio of convictions based on confessions. Slovakia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>51. Chile congratulated Saint Vincent and the Grenadines for its efforts to improve the 
living conditions of its population, including the establishment of a fund for poverty 
reduction, the Social Recovery Programme, the Basic Needs Trust Fund, the Programme 
for Social Security Networks and the Street Children Rehabilitation Programme, among 
others. It encouraged the Government to continue strengthening those policies. Chile made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. The proposed new Constitution would have created an independent human rights 
entity similar to the one being recommended by many members of the Human Rights 
Council. In the light of the defeat of the constitutional referendum, that and other provisions 
were being reviewed. The country also hoped to strengthen civil society. 
</p>
<p>53. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines categorically rejected the implication that there 
were notable occurrences of racial discrimination affecting children, including children of 
minorities such as Amerindians. Given its own history, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 
took such implications very seriously. The descendents of indigenous peoples had been 
banished to very rural areas by the pre-independence colonial powers. To the extent that 
those children experienced difficulties, they were the product of their rural location, and 
such difficulties would be indistinguishable from other rural children, irrespective of race or 
ethnicity. 
</p>
<p>54. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines also questioned the basis for the assertion that 
large numbers of children were suffering from severe food insecurity. A number of policy 
interventions were in place to prevent such conditions, ranging from providing meals in 
schools to increasing social security payments to mothers and other means of strengthening 
the social safety net.  
</p>
<p>55. Regarding teen pregnancy, the delegation referred to the policy initiatives to return 
mothers to school after giving birth and provide them with health care and child support as 
regional best practices. 
</p>
<p>56. Noting the number of States that raised the issue of technical cooperation and the 
need for more timely responses in fulfilling reporting obligations under various human 
rights treaties, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines stressed the need for such cooperation and </p>


<p>expressed its willingness to avail itself of capacity-building assistance in whatever form it 
was offered. As a small State dedicated to human rights, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 
was eager to add its voice to the weight of international consensus on human rights through 
the ratification of the relevant treaties. However, each of the treaties incurred a financial 
cost or a reporting burden that was often difficult to meet. In acting in solidarity with 
international opinion on human rights issues, small States often found themselves later 
singled out for failing to meet their reporting burdens.  
</p>
<p>57. Regarding the issuance of a standing invitation to special procedures, Saint Vincent 
and the Grenadines expressed caution that, given the existing number of special procedures, 
a standing invitation might impose an unwelcome financial burden on small States. No 
Caribbean Community State had extended a standing invitation to special procedures. 
However, more than half of the 82 States that had extended such an invitation were from 
Europe. In the light of those facts, the Human Rights Council was encouraged to explore 
ways in which the benefits of a standing invitation could be better explained to other States. 
Also, the Council should consider extending assistance to small States that issued standing 
invitations. 
</p>
<p>58. With regard to child pornography, the delegation referred to the existing legislative 
framework, which would make it difficult for child pornography to flourish. 
</p>
<p>59. Regarding female offenders, the delegation clarified that women in prison facilities 
were held separately from male detainees and their rights were respected. On the excessive 
use of force of the police service, the delegation admitted its existence and reported that the 
Government was training police forces, although there was still some insensitivity in that 
regard.  
</p>
<p>60. With regard to the criminal age of responsibility, the delegation invited concerned 
States to review the Common Law. The law provided that a child aged 8 or under would 
not be considered criminally responsible, but between the ages of 8 and 16 there was a 
judicial inquiry into the capacity of a child to understand right or wrong and whether the 
child should be charged as an adult.  
</p>
<p>61. The delegation indicated that juveniles were not hosted together with the adult 
population but in a separate detention facility. Referring to the Debtors Act and its criminal 
penalties, the delegation reported that it had been revised. 
</p>
<p>62. Some successes in the battle against HIV/AIDS had been recorded. Mother-to-child 
transmission of the disease had been virtually eliminated, and the rate of infection had 
stabilized. Infected persons were also living for longer periods of time. Because of that, 
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines currently faced the challenge of sourcing more advanced 
antiretroviral medication, and called on the producers of such second-line medicines to 
make them available to poor and small States. 
</p>
<p>63. Regarding the impacts of climate change on the enjoyment of human rights, Saint 
Vincent and the Grenadines emphasized the devastating impact of recent hurricanes and 
flash floods. Those weather events were becoming increasingly frequent and intense, and 
were occurring beyond the traditional &#8220;seasons&#8221; for such activity. Climate change was 
causing massive damage to homes and infrastructure, and to the enjoyment of individual 
rights. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines thanked States that had provided assistance in the 
wake of recent weather events. 
</p>
<p>64.<b> </b>Jamaica noted that it was mindful of the challenges faced by small island developing 
States. Jamaica congratulated Saint Vincent and the Grenadines for its accomplishments in 
the areas of housing, education, social security, health and provisions for children, women 
and persons with disabilities. It highlighted positive results in the area of education, such as 
the increase in accessibility to education for children with disabilities, and the reduction in </p>


<p>the functional illiteracy rate. Jamaica welcomed the creation of the Gender Affairs 
Department and the pilot study on gender budgeting and Government resource allocation. 
Jamaica called on OHCHR to respond appropriately to the needs and concerns expressed, 
by providing effective and timely technical assistance and capacity-building support.  
</p>
<p>65. Portugal noted with appreciation the progress achieved in recent years in the fields 
of democracy, governance and social, economic and cultural rights, with health care and 
education being provided free of charge to the population. It inquired about measures being 
considered to prevent the use of corporal punishment against children. It also asked whether 
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines intended to amend legal provisions, including the Penal 
Code, so as to replace the death penalty with other penalties that did not include cruel, 
inhuman or degrading punishments. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. Barbados embraced the constitutional protection of human rights, the empowerment 
of its people and the development of a sustained partnership with civil society. It welcomed 
efforts to undertake a revision of the Domestic Violence Act of 1998 to include the 
protection of the rights of women, girls and children from sexual exploitation. Barbados 
noted the initiatives to ensure the rights of women and their full and active participation in 
mainstream society. It commended the country on its initiatives to provide social safety nets 
and its emphasis on initiatives to achieve socio-economic development through 
improvements in education and health. It encouraged the provision of technical assistance 
for the revision of legislation and policies in human-rights related areas on which the 
country was presently working. Barbados made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>67. Trinidad and Tobago noted that despite being severely affected by the global 
financial crisis, a hurricane and a decision within the World Trade Organization that had 
eroded the viability of its once-thriving banana industry, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 
had managed to honour its commitment to promote human rights. It commended the 
importance given to children&#8217;s rights and youth development, as evidenced by the country&#8217;s 
social programmes. It commended the delegation for efforts to address poverty, gender 
equality and the empowerment of women and to combat domestic violence and sexual 
exploitation of women, and also commended it for the country&#8217;s HIV/AIDS programmes. 
Trinidad and Tobago stated its hope that development partners would be responsive to the 
needs of that highly vulnerable State. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>68. Ecuador noted advances made by Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in the area of 
human rights. It noted the challenges with regard to poverty, unemployment and unequal 
distribution of wealth. Ecuador encouraged Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to continue 
developing the country and improving human rights. It congratulated the country on its 
ratification of human rights international instruments such as the Convention on the Rights 
of Persons with Disabilities and the Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All 
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. Ecuador made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>69. Costa Rica asked about measures taken by the country to prevent the negative 
impact of climate change and the degradation of the environment on the enjoyment of 
fundamental rights. Costa Rica recognized the challenges and limitations confronted by 
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and took note of actions taken, particularly in the area of 
gender equality and the empowerment of women. Costa Rica made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>70. Haiti congratulated Saint Vincent and the Grenadines for the measures adopted and 
for its results in the areas of housing and education. It commended the country for its 
implementation of programmes to improve the living conditions of the population and for 
the ratification of the main universal human rights instruments. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>71. In response to comments on individual complaint mechanisms, the delegation 
indicated that Saint Vincent and the Grenadines would hope that, in any context, 
individuals would exhaust first the domestic legal remedies before going to international </p>


<p>bodies. The delegation noted that the judicial system in the country was robust, independent 
and active. 
</p>
<p>72. Regarding the issue of the rights of the child, the delegation added that the State 
took the issue very seriously in its policy initiatives on youth and children.   
</p>
<p>73. The Government was also focusing on actions to protect and promote the rights of 
persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>74. The delegation reported that Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was reviewing the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, in particular with regard to the burden that it would entail. Although torture 
was foreign to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, the country would like to add its voice to 
the international consensus, without also incurring additional costs and burdens on the 
State.  
</p>
<p>75. In conclusion, the delegation reiterated the commitment of Saint Vincent and the 
Grenadines to improving the human rights situation in the country and thanked delegations 
for their comments and recommendations.
