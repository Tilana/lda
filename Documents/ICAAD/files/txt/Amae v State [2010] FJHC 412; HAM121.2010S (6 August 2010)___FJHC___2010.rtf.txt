Ruling: 6th August 2010 

RULING ON BAIL APPLICATION

1. In High Court Miscellaneous Case No. 56/10 and 69/10, I refused the applicants' application for bail for the reasons explained in that ruling. I said that, if the applicants' want to relodge their bail application in future, new grounds must be provided to enable the court to deal with their new applications.

2. I have read and carefully considered the applicants' notice of motion for bail, and their affidavits in support. I have also read and carefully considered the State's affidavit in reply from police investigation officer DC Solomoni Vorakitaki. The applicants really have provided no new grounds. I therefore repeat what I said in my ruling on 21st May 2010, and attach a copy of that ruling for your benefit. The applicants' application for bail are denied, and my ruling of 21st May 2010 remains.
