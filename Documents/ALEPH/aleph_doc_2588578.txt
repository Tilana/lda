MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
FOR THE PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2016
This  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  (“MD&A”)  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  condensed  consolidated  interim  financial
statements of Endeavour Silver Corp. (“Endeavour” or “the Company”) for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 and
the related notes contained therein, which are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by
the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”). In addition, the following should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the related MD&A. We use certain non-IFRS financial measures in this MD&A.
For a description of each of the non-IFRS measures used in this MD&A, please see the discussion under “Non-IFRS Measures”. Additional
information relating to the Company, including the most recent Annual Information Form, is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com, and the
Company’s most recent annual report on Form 40-F has been filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). This MD&A
contains “forward-looking statements”  that  are  subject  to  risk  factors  set  out  in  a  cautionary  note  contained  herein.  All  dollar  amounts  are
expressed i n United States (“US”) dollars and tabular amounts are expressed in thousands of US dollars unless otherwise indicated. This
MD&A is dated as of August 2, 2016 and all information contained is current as of August 2, 2016 unless otherwise stated.
Cautionary  Note  to  US  Investors  concerning  Estimates  of Mineral  Reserves  and  Measured,  Indicated  and  Inferred  Mineral
Resources:
This  MD&A  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  the  securities  laws  in  effect  in  Canada,  which  differ  from  the
requirements  of  US  securities  laws.  Unless  otherwise  indicated,  all  reserve  and  resource  estimates  included  in  this  MD&A  have  been
prepared  in  accordance  with  Canadian  National  Instrument  43-101 –  Standards  of  Disclosure  for  Mineral  Projects  (“NI  43-101”)  and  the
Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the “CIM”) - CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves,
adopted by the CIM Council, as amended. NI 43 101 is an instrument developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators that establishes
standards  for  all  public  disclosure  an  issuer  makes  of  scientific  and  technical  information  concerning mineral  projects.  The  terms  “mineral
reserve”, “proven mineral reserve” and “probable mineral reserve” are Canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with NI 43 101 and
CIM standards. These definitions differ from the definitions in SEC Industry Guide 7 under the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“Securities Act”).
Under  United  States  standards,  mineralization  may  not  be  classified  as  a  “reserve”  unless  the  determination  has  been  made  that  the
mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. Under SEC Industry
Guide 7 standards, a “final” or “bankable” feasibility study is required to report reserves, the three-year historical average price is used in any
reserve  or  cash  flow  analysis  to  designate  reserves  and  the  primary  environmental  analysis  or  report  must  be  filed  with  the  appropriate
governmental authority.
In addition, the terms “mineral resource”, “measured mineral resource”, “indicated mineral resource” and “inferred mineral resource” are defined
in and required to be disclosed by NI 43-101; however, these terms are not defined terms under SEC Industry Guide 7 and are normally not
permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of
mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into reserves. “Inferred mineral resources” have a great amount of uncertainty as to
their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral
resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of
feasibility  or  pre-feasibility  studies,  except  in  rare  cases.  Investors  are  cautioned  not  to  assume  that  all  or  any  part  of  an  inferred  mineral
resource exists or is economically or legally mineable. Disclosure of “contained ounces” in a resource is permitted disclosure under Canadian
regulations; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute “reserves” by SEC Industry Guide
7 standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures.
Accordingly, information contained in this MD&A contains descriptions of Endeavour’s mineral deposits that may not be comparable to similar
information made public by US companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements under the US federal securities laws and the
rules and regulations thereunder.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
FOR THE PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2016
Forward-Looking Statements
This MD&A contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and
“forward-looking  information”  within  the  meaning  of  applicable  Canadian  securities  legislation. Such  forward-looking  statements  and
information herein include, but are not limited to, statements regarding Endeavour’s anticipated performance in 2016, including silver and gold
production, timing and expenditures to develop new silver mines and mineralized zones, silver and gold grades and recoveries, cash costs per
ounce, capital expenditures and sustaining capital. Forward-looking statements are frequently characterized by words such as “plan”, “expect”,
“forecast”, “project”, ”intend”, ”believe”, ”anticipate”, “outlook” and other similar words, or statements that certain events or conditions “may” or
“will” occur. Forward- looking statements are based on the opinions and estimates of management at the dates the statements are made, and
are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those
projected in the forward-looking statements.
The Company does not intend to, and does not assume any obligation to update such forward-looking statements or information, other than as
required by applicable law. Forward-looking statements or information involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that
may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements of the Company and its operations to be materially different from
those expressed or implied by such statements. Such factors include, among others: fluctuations in the prices of silver and gold, fluctuations in
the currency markets (particularly the Mexican peso, Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar); changes in national and local governments, legislation,
taxation, controls, regulations and political or economic developments in Canada and Mexico; operating or technical difficulties in mineral
exploration, development and mining activities; risks and hazards of mineral exploration, development and mining (including, but not limited to
environmental  hazards,  industrial  accidents,  unusual  or  unexpected  geological  conditions,  pressures,  cave-ins  and  flooding);  inadequate
insurance, or inability to obtain insurance; availability of and costs associated with mining inputs and labour; the speculative nature of mineral
exploration and development, diminishing quantities or grades of mineral reserves as properties are mined; the ability to successfully integrate
acquisitions; risks in obtaining necessary licenses and permits, and challenges to the Company’s title to properties; as well as those factors
described  in  the  section  “risk  factors”  contained  in  the  Company’s  Annual  Information  Form  filed  with  the  Canadian  securities  regulatory
authorities and as filed with the SEC in our Annual Report on Form 40-F. Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors
that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements or information, there may be other factors
that cause results to be materially different from those anticipated, described, estimated, assessed or intended. There can be no assurance that
any forward-looking statements or information will prove to be accurate as actual results and future events could differ materially from those
anticipated  in  such  statements  or  information.  Accordingly,  readers  should  not  place  undue  reliance  on  forward-looking  statements  or
information.

Silver equivalents are calculated using a 70:1 ratio for 2015 and a 75:1 ratio for 2016
The Company reports non-IFRS measures which include cash costs net of by-products on a payable silver basis, total production costs
per ounce, all-in sustaining costs per ounce and direct production costs per tonne, in order to manage and evaluate operating
performance at each of the Company’s mines. These measures, some established by the Silver Institute (Production Cost Standards,
June 2011), are widely used in the silver mining industry as a benchmark for performance, but do not have a standardized meaning.
These measures are reported on a production basis. See Reconciliation to IFRS beginning on page 15.
Cash costs net of by-products per payable silver ounce include mining, processing (including smelting, refining, transportation and
selling costs), and direct overhead, net of gold credits. See Reconciliation to IFRS on page 17.
Total production costs per ounce include mining, processing (including smelting, refining, transportation and selling costs), direct
overhead, amortization, depletion and amortization at the operation sites. See Reconciliation to IFRS on page 17.
All-in sustaining cost per ounce include mining, processing (including smelting, refining, transportation and selling costs), direct
overhead, corporate general and administration, on-site exploration, share-based compensation, reclamation and sustaining capital net
of gold credits. See Reconciliation to IFRS on page 18.
Direct production costs per tonne include mining, processing (including smelting, refining, transportation and selling costs) and direct
overhead at the operation sites. See Reconciliation to IFRS on page 17.
Silver co-product cash cost and gold co-product cash cost include mining, processing (including smelting, refining, transportation and
selling costs), and direct overhead allocated on pro-rated basis of realized metal value. See Reconciliation to IFRS on page 19
Mine operating cash flow is calculated by adding back amortization, depletion, inventory write downs and share-based compensation to
mine operating earnings. Mine operating earnings and mine operating cash flow are before taxes. See Reconciliation to IFRS on page
15.
See Reconciliation to IFRS on page 15 for the reconciliation of operating cash flow before working capital changes and the operating
cash flow before working capital changes per share.
See Reconciliation of Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization on page 16.
The  above  highlights  are  key  measures  used  by  management,  however  they  should  not  be  the  sole  measures  used  in  determining  the
performance of the Company’s operations.

HISTORY AND STRATEGY
The Company is engaged in silver mining in Mexico and related activities including property acquisition, exploration, development, mineral
extraction, processing, refining and reclamation. The Company is also engaged in exploration activities in Chile.
Historically, the business philosophy was to acquire and explore early-stage mineral prospects in Canada and the US. In 2002 the Company
was re-organized, a new management team was appointed, and the business strategy was revised to focus on acquiring advanced-stage
silver mining properties in Mexico. Mexico, despite its long and prolific history of metal production, appeared to be relatively under-explored
using modern exploration techniques and offered promising geological potential for precious metals exploration and production.
After evaluating several mineral properties in Mexico in 2003, the Company negotiated an option to purchase the Guanaceví silver mines and
process plant located in Durango, Mexico in May 2004. Management recognized that even though the mines had run out of ore, little modern
exploration had been carried out to discover new silver ore-bodies. Exploration drilling commenced in June 2004 and was quickly met with
encouraging results. By September 2004, sufficient high-grade silver mineralization had been outlined to justify the development of an access
ramp into the newly discovered North Porvenir ore-body. In December 2004, the Company commenced the mining and processing of ore from
the new North Porvenir mine to produce silver doré bars.
In 2007, the Company replicated the success of Guanaceví with the acquisition of the Bolañitos (formerly described as “Guanajuato”) mines
project in Guanajuato State. Bolañitos was very similar in that there was a fully built and permitted processing plant, and the mines were
running out of ore, so the operation was for sale. The acquisition was finalized in May 2007 and as a result of the successful mine rehabilitation
and  subsequent  exploration  work,  silver  production,  reserves  and  resources  grew  rapidly  and  Bolañitos  became  an  integral  part  of  the
Company’s asset base.
Both Guanaceví and Bolañitos are good examples of Endeavour’s historical business model of acquiring fully built and permitted silver mines
that were about to close for lack of ore. By bringing the money and expertise needed to find new silver ore-bodies, Endeavour has successfully
re-opened  and  expanded  these  mines  to  develop  their  full  potential.  The  benefit  of  acquiring  fully  built  and  permitted  mining  and  milling
infrastructure is that if new exploration efforts are successful, the mine development cycle from discovery to production only takes a matter of
months instead of the several years normally required in the traditional mining business model.
In 2012, the Company acquired the El Cubo silver-gold mine located in Guanajuato, Mexico. El Cubo had similar challenges to Endeavour’s
past acquisitions, but with two significant exceptions; the property came with substantial reserves and resources, and the mine was already
operating  at  1,100  tonnes  per  day  (tpd).  After  acquisition,  Endeavour  initiated  a  two  year  operational  turn-around  and  capital  investment
program aimed at increasing throughput, grade and productivity in order to reduce operating costs and return the operation to profitability.
The Company has historically funded its exploration and development activities through equity financings and convertible debentures. Equity
financings  also  facilitated  the  acquisition  and  development  of  the  Guanaceví  and  Bolañitos  mines  projects.  However,  since  2004,  the
Company has been able to finance more and more of its acquisition, exploration, development and operating activities from production cash
flows. In 2012 the Company obtained a credit facility to help support its acquisition, exploration and capital investment programs, which was
subsequently converted to a term loan. The Company may choose to engage in equity, debt, convertible debt or other financings, on an as-
needed basis, in order to facilitate its growth.

Consolidated Production
Silver equivalents are calculated using a 70:1 ratio for 2015 and a 75:1 ratio for 2016.
Three months ended June 30, 2016 (compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015) 
Consolidated silver production during Q2, 2016 was 1,551,851 ounces (oz), a decrease of 14% compared to 1,805,569 oz in Q2, 2015, and
gold production was 15,649 oz, an increase of 17% compared to 13,430 oz in Q2, 2015. Plant throughput was 377,198 tonnes at average
grades of 148 grams per tonne (gpt) silver and 1.58 gpt gold compared to 371,745 tonnes grading 180 gpt silver and 1.32 gpt gold in Q2, 2015.
Silver production decreased due to lower grades partially offset by higher recoveries. Gold production increased due to higher grades, partially
offset by lower recoveries. The increased throughput at Bolañitos, which processed lower silver grades than the other operations and lower
silver grades at Guanaceví were the primary drivers of these variations from 2015.
Six months ended June 30, 2016 (compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015) 
Consolidated silver production during 2016 was 3,061,916 oz, a decrease of 16% compared to 3,625,619 oz in 2015, and gold production was
31,609 oz, an increase of 8% compared to 29,238 oz in 2015. Plant throughput was 785,751 tonnes at average grades of 143 gpt silver and
1.53 gpt gold compared to 752,537 tonnes grading 177 gpt silver and 1.42 gpt gold in 2015. Silver production decreased due to lower grades
partially offset by higher throughput. Gold production increased due to higher throughput and grades, partially offset by lower recoveries. The
increased throughput at Bolañitos, which processed lower silver grades than the other operations and lower silver grades at Guanaceví were
the primary drivers of these variations from 2015.
Consolidated Operating Costs
Three months ended June 30, 2016 (compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015) 
The weaker Mexican peso, reduction of contractors and continued focus on cost reductions resulted in lower consolidated costs per tonne,
which fell 12% to $73.01 compared to Q2, 2015. Cash costs, net of by-product credits (a non-IFRS measure and a standard of the Silver
Institute), decreased 38% to $5.37 per oz of payable silver compared to $8.60 per oz in Q2, 2015 as a result of the lower costs per tonne and
higher gold credit. The lower costs per tonne and the suspension of exploration and development expenditures at the Bolañitos and El Cubo
operations resulted in all-in-sustaining costs (also a non-IFRS measure) decreasing 38% to $10.53 per oz compared to $16.86 per oz in Q2,
2015.

Six months ended June 30, 2016 (compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015) 
The weaker Mexican peso, reduction of contractors and continued focus on cost reductions resulted in lower consolidated costs per tonne,
which fell 11% to $73.66 compared to 2015. Cash costs, net of by-product credits (a non-IFRS measure and a standard of the Silver Institute),
decreased 18% to $6.49 per oz of payable silver compared to $7.88 per oz in 2015 as a result of the lower costs per tonne and higher gold
credit offset partially due to lower ore grades. The lower costs per tonne and the suspension of exploration and development expenditures at
the  Bolañitos  and  El  Cubo  operations  resulted  in  all-in-sustaining  costs  (also  a  non-IFRS  measure)  decreasing  28%  to  $10.82  per  oz
compared to $15.09 per oz in 2015.

Silver equivalents are calculated using a 70:1 ratio for 2015 and a 75:1 ratio for 2016.
The Company reports non-IFRS measures which include cash costs net of by-product on a payable silver basis, total production costs
per ounce, all-in sustaining costs per ounce and direct production costs per tonne, in order to manage and evaluate operating
performance at each of the Company’s mines. These measures, some established by the Silver Institute (Production Cost Standards,
June 2011), are widely used in the silver mining industry as a benchmark for performance, but do not have a standardized meaning.
These measures are reported on a production basis. See Reconciliation to IFRS beginning on page 15.
Cash costs net of by-product per payable silver ounce include mining, processing (including smelting, refining, transportation and
selling costs), and direct overhead, net of gold credits. See Reconciliation to IFRS on page 17.
Total production costs per ounce include mining, processing (including smelting, refining, transportation and selling costs), direct
overhead, amortization, depletion and amortization at the operation sites. See Reconciliation to IFRS on page 17.
All-in sustaining cost per ounce include mining, processing (including smelting, refining, transportation and selling costs), direct
overhead, corporate general and administration, on-site exploration, share-based compensation, reclamation and sustaining capital net
of gold credits. See Reconciliation to IFRS on page 18.

Direct production costs per tonne include mining, processing (including smelting, refining, transportation and selling costs) and direct
overhead at the operation sites. See Reconciliation to IFRS on page 17.
Silver co-product cash cost and gold co-product cash cost include mining, processing (including smelting, refining, transportation and
selling costs), and direct overhead allocated on pro-rated basis of realized metal value. See Reconciliation to IFRS on page 19.
Guanaceví has produced more than 26 million ounces of silver and over 63,000 ounces of gold since Endeavour acquired it in 2004. Although
the historic mine was closed and the plant was struggling to process 100 tpd of old tailings in 2004, Guanaceví is now producing 1,200 tpd of
high-grade ore. The Company has discovered five high-grade silver-gold ore bodies along a five kilometre length of the prolific Santa Cruz
vein and developed four new mines, one of which is now mined out. The Guanaceví operation currently includes three underground silver-gold
mines, a cyanidation leach plant, mining camp, and administration and housing facilities. Guanaceví provides steady employment for 550
people and engages 350 contractors.

Guanaceví Production Results
Three months ended June 30, 2016 (compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015) 
Silver production at the Guanaceví mine during Q2, 2016 was 629,221 oz, a decrease of 34% compared to 958,581 oz in Q2, 2015, and gold
production was 1,365 oz, a decrease of 30% compared to 1,946 oz in Q2, 2015. Plant throughput was 98,756 tonnes at average grades of 232
gpt silver and 0.49 gpt gold compared to 108,817 tonnes grading 325 gpt silver and 0.64 gpt gold in Q2, 2015. Metal production decreased due
to lower throughput and ore grades. The lower ore grades were a result of mining lower grade material within the ore-bodies, while the prior
year’s  higher  grades  were  due  to  the  contribution  of  the  higher  grade  Porvenir  Cuatro  ore-body,  which  resulted  in  higher  silver  and  gold
production in Q2, 2015. Throughput was lower due to mine development being behind plan. The Company changed the mining contractor in
January and changed the operation manager in May. Management expects to attain the planned level of production in the second half of 2016.
Six months ended June 30, 2016 (compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015) 
Silver production at the Guanaceví mine during 2016 was 1,280,952 oz, a decrease of 29% compared to 1,811,687 oz in 2015, and gold
production was 2,933 oz, a decrease of 23% compared to 3,823 oz in 2015. Plant throughput was 197,532 tonnes at average grades of 241 gpt
silver and 0.52 gpt gold compared to 214,923 tonnes grading 312 gpt silver and 0.64 gpt gold in 2015. Metal production decreased due to
lower ore grades and throughput. The lower ore grades were a result of mining deeper within the ore-bodies where grades tend to be lower,
while the prior year’s higher grades were due to the contribution of the higher grade Porvenir Cuatro ore-body, which resulted in higher silver
and  gold  production  in  the  first  half  of  2015.  Throughput  was  lower  due  to  mine  development  being  slightly  behind  plan.  The  Company
changed the mining contractor in January and changed the operation manager in May. Management expects to attain the planned level of
production in the second half of 2016. In Q1, 2016, the ore stockpile built over the last six years was fully depleted resulting in 23,800 more
tonnes processed than estimated in stockpile.
Guanaceví Operating Costs
Three months ended June 30, 2016 (compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015) 
Direct  production  costs  per-tonne  decreased  by  10%  in  Q2,  2016  compared  to  Q2,  2015  due  primarily  to  the  weaker  Mexican  peso  and
management’s continued focus on reducing costs. The lower direct costs per tonne were offset by lower ore grades resulting in higher cash
costs per oz, net of by-product credits (a non-IFRS measure and a standard of the Silver Institute), which rose 33% to $10.82 per oz of payable
silver compared to $8.14 per oz in Q2, 2015. The lower ore grades and higher development expenditures resulted in higher all-in-sustaining
costs (also a non-IFRS measure) which increased 50% to $20.11 per oz.
Six months ended June 30, 2016 (compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015) 
Direct  production  costs  per-tonne  decreased  by  14%  in  2016  compared  to  2015  due  primarily  to  processing  more  stockpile  tonnes  than
previously estimated. After adjusting for the additional stockpile tonnes, the Company estimates direct costs per tonne to be approximately $82
per tonne. The lower adjusted direct costs compared to the prior year were due to the weaker peso and management’s continued focus on
reducing costs. The lower direct costs per tonne were offset by lower ore grades resulting in slightly higher cash costs per oz, net of by-product
credits (a non-IFRS measure and a standard of the Silver Institute), which increased 15% to $9.43 per oz of payable silver compared to $8.19
per  oz  in  2015.  The  lower  ore  grades  and  higher  development  expenditures  resulted  in  higher  all-in-sustaining  costs  (also  a  non-IFRS
measure) which increased 33% to $16.46 per oz.

The  Bolañitos  mine  encompasses  three  operating  silver-gold  mines  and  a  flotation  plant  and  is  located  10  kilometres  from  the  city  of
Guanajuato in the state of Guanajuato. Following Endeavour’s acquisition in 2007, cash costs of production were as high as $32 per oz and
the operation was struggling to produce 300,000 ounces of silver per year. Following the execution of management’s business strategy, cash
costs of production became negative due to economies of scale and the rising gold credits as production grew. Bolañitos’ processing plant
was expanded in phases from 500 tpd in 2007 to 1,600 tpd in 2012. In 2013, additional mine output was processed at the El Cubo facilities
allowing  production  to  exceed  plant  capacity  whereas,  in  2014,  production  reverted  to  the  1,600  tpd  Bolañitos  plant  capacity.  In  2015,
Bolañitos  reduced  mine  output  to  1,000  tpd  as  underground  resources  focused  on  the  development  of  the  LL-  Asunción  ore-body.  Since
acquisition, the Bolañitos operation has produced over 12 million ounces of silver and over 197,000 ounces of gold. Bolañitos provides steady
employment for 350 people and engages 220 contractors.

Bolañitos Production Results
Three months ended June 30, 2016 (compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015) 
Silver production at the Bolañitos mine was 276,885 oz during Q2, 2016, a decrease of 26% compared to 376,305 oz in Q2, 2015, and gold
production was 8,470 oz compared to 4,982 oz in Q2, 2015. Plant throughput in Q2, 2016 was 136,322 tonnes at average grades of 80 gpt
silver and 2.38 gpt gold, compared to 106,148 tonnes grading 131 gpt silver and 1.72 gpt gold in Q2, 2015. Silver production was down due to
lower silver grades and recoveries, while gold production increased due to the higher gold grades. Bolañitos production came primarily from
the LL-Asunción ore-body which has lower silver grades and higher gold grades compared to historical production from the Lucero ore-bodies.
Mine development and exploration expenditures were halted in Q1, 2016 as further development of the LL-Asunción ore-body and Plateros
discovery provided insufficient returns with 2015 gold and silverprices. The mine focused on extracting and processing the accessible ore to
maximize cash flow during the quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, the Company revised its operating plan. See the 2016 Outlook section on
page 25 for additional discussion.
Six months ended June 30, 2016 (compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015) 
Silver production at the Bolañitos mine was 611,454 oz during 2016, a decrease of 32% compared to 897,422 oz in 2015, and gold production
was 16,919 oz compared to 13,403 oz in 2015. Plant throughput in 2016 was 273,450 tonnes at average grades of 87 gpt silver and 2.35 gpt
gold, compared to 242,224 tonnes grading 136 gpt silver and 2.05 gpt gold in 2015. Silver production was down due to lower silver grades and
recoveries, while gold production increased due the higher gold grades. Bolañitos production came primarily from the LL-Asunción ore-body
which has lower silver grades and higher gold grades compared to historical production from the Lucero ore-bodies. Bolañitos operated at its
existing  capacity  of  1,600  tpd  in  the  first  quarter  2015,  but  gradually  reduced  to  1,000  tpd  over  the  course  of  2015.  The  mine  halted
development and exploration expenditures at the end of 2015 as further development of the LL-Asunción ore-body and Plateros discovery
would  have  provided  insufficient  returns  based  on  the  2015  closing  metal  prices.  The  mine  focused  on  extracting  and  processing  the
accessible to ore to maximize cash flow during the quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, the Company revised its operating plan. See 2016
Outlook section on page 25 for additional discussion.
Bolañitos Operating Costs
Three months ended June 30, 2016 (compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015)
In Q2, 2016, direct production costs per tonne fell 10% to $63.94 per tonne due to the weaker Mexican peso, reduced contractor activity and
management’s focus on reducing costs. The lower costs per tonne resulted in significantly lower cash costs per oz, net of by-product credits
(which is a non-IFRS measure and a standard of the Silver Institute), falling to negative $7.08 per oz of payable silver compared to $4.82 per
oz the same period in 2015. Similarly, all-in sustaining costs (also a non-IFRS measure) fell 131% to negative $4.25 per oz compared to
$13.80 per oz in Q2, 2015, due to the lower costs per tonne and the suspension of development and exploration activities.
Six months ended June 30, 2016 (compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015) 
In  2016,  direct  production  costs  per  tonne  fell  15%  to  $61.98  per  tonne  due  to  the  weaker  Mexican  peso,  reduced  contractor  activity  and
management’s focus on reducing costs. The lower costs per tonne resulted in significantly lower cash costs per oz, net of by-product credits
(which is a non-IFRS measure and a standard of the Silver Institute), falling to negative $6.60 per oz of payable silver compared to $2.12 per
oz over the same period in 2015. Similarly, all-in sustaining costs (also a non-IFRS measure) fell 142% to negative $3.87 per oz compared to
$9.13 per oz in 2015, due to the lower costs per tonne and the suspension of development and exploration activities.

Endeavour’s  third  mine,  El  Cubo,  was  acquired  in  July  2012.  El  Cubo  was  a  good  fit  with  Endeavour's  business  strategy  of  buying  and
rejuvenating struggling old mines in historic mining districts. However, unlike Guanaceví and Bolañitos, which had low throughputs and no
reserves, El Cubo offered the potential to quickly become a core asset for Endeavour, by already having throughput of 1,100 tpd output and a
reasonable reserve/resource mine life. Located in the southeastern part of the historic Guanajuato mining district, the producing El Cubo silver
and gold mine is only 15 kilometres from Endeavour’s Bolañitos project, and included many mine adits, ramps, and shafts, as well as a 400 tpd
leach plant.. Since acquisition, the El Cubo operation has produced over 6 million ounces of silver and over 80,000 ounces of gold. El Cubo
currently employs 590 people and engages 150 contractors.

El Cubo Production Results
Three months ended June 30, 2016 (compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015) 
Silver production at the El Cubo mine was 645,745 ounces in Q2, 2016, an increase of 37% compared to 470,683 oz in Q2, 2015 and gold
production was 5,814 oz in Q2, 2016, a decrease of 11% compared to 6,502 oz in Q2, 2015. Plant throughput in Q2, 2016 was 142,120 tonnes
at average grades of 156 gpt silver and 1.56 gpt gold, compared to 156,780 tonnes grading 112 gpt silver and 1.51 gpt gold in Q2, 2015. The
significantly higher silver grades and recoveries resulted in higher silver production. Gold grades were slightly higher, however lower gold
recoveries and throughput resulted in lower gold production. The 2016 operational plan originally called for throughput gradually reducing over
the year until the mine went on care and maintenance by year-end, with efforts focused on extracting and processing the accessible to ore to
maximize cash flow over the year. Subsequent to quarter end, the Company revised its operating plan. See 2016 Outlook on page 25 for
additional discussion.
Six months ended June 30, 2016 (compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015) 
Silver  production  at  the  El  Cubo  mine  was  1,169,510  ounces  in  2016,  an  increase  of  28%  compared  to  916,510  oz  in  2015  and  gold
production was 11,757 oz in 2016, a decrease of 2% compared to 12,012 oz in 2015. Plant throughput in Q2, 2016 was 314,769 tonnes at
average  grades  of  131  gpt  silver  and  1.46  gpt  gold,  compared  to  295,390  tonnes  grading  113  gpt  silver  and  1.48  gpt  gold  in  2015.  The
significantly higher silver grades and recoveries, combined with higher throughput resulted in higher silver production, while gold production
was slightly lower due primarily to lower recoveries. The 2016 operational plan originally called for throughput gradually reducing over the year
until the mine went on care and maintenance by year-end, with efforts focused on extracting and processing the accessible to ore to maximize
cash  flow  over  the  year.  Subsequent  to  quarter  end,  the  Company  revised  its  operating  plan.  See  2016  Outlook  section  on  page  25  for
additional discussion.
El Cubo Operating Costs
Three months ended June 30, 2016 (compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015) 
The reduced use of contractors, the weaker peso and management efforts to reduce costs drove direct production costs per tonne lower by
11% compared to the same period in 2015. The lower costs per tonne and higher ore grades decreased cash costs net of by-product credits (a
non-IFRS measure and a standard of the Silver Institute) by 59% to $5.21 per oz of payable silver compared to $12.59 per oz in the same
period in 2015. All-in sustaining costs decreased by 73% to $7.20 per oz compared to $26.56 per oz in Q2, 2015 due to the lower costs per
tonne, higher ore grades and the suspension of exploration and developments activities.
Six months ended June 30, 2016 (compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015) 
The reduced use of contractors, the weaker Mexican peso and management efforts to reduce costs, offset by development expensed in Q1,
2016 drove direct production costs per tonne lower by 5% compared to the same period in 2015. The lower costs per tonne and higher ore
grades decreased cash costs net of by-product credits (a non-IFRS measure and a standard of the Silver Institute) by 23% to $9.99 per oz of
payable silver compared to $12.91 per oz over the same period in 2015. All-in sustaining costs decreased by 54% to $12.09 per oz compared
to $26.50 per oz in 2015 due to the lower costs per tonne, higher ore grades and the suspension of exploration and developments activities
part way through the first quarter.
Exploration Results
In January, the Company guided exploration expenditures totaling $2.5 million on exploration drilling at Guanaceví and property holding costs
in Mexico, with a contingent budget to invest an additional $7.0 million on additional exploration, engineering and land acquisition, primarily at
Terronera,  subject  to  financing.  Endeavour’s  cash  and  working  capital  positions  grew  substantially  during  the  first  half  of  2016  (See  the
Liquidity and Capital Resources section on page 27) due to higher metal prices, stronger cash flows, and two “At-The-Market” equity offerings.
12
During the first half of 2016, the Company incurred expenditures of $2.9 million related to mapping, sampling, drilling and engineering. Of this
amount $1.4 million was incurred at the Terronera project for drilling, mapping and engineering work. To date, mapping has extended the
Terronera vein system over a seven square km area and identified nine additional veins in the northern half of the property. Sampling of the
Terronera vein system confirmed that high-grade, low sulphidation epithermal silver-gold mineralization is present in many of the veins.
The  remaining  exploration  expenditures  were  across  the  Company’s  other  properties  including  drilling  at  Guanaceví,  and  mapping  and
surveying at Guadalupe y Calvo and the Chilean properties.
On May 27, 2016, the Company issued 2,147,239 common shares to Canarc Resource Corp (“Canarc”), a related party of the Company, and
assumed Canarc’s obligation to pay an aggregate of 165 troy ounces of gold to Marlin Gold Mining Ltd to acquire a 100% interest in Canarc’s
wholly-owned subsidiary, Oro Silver Resources Ltd, which owns the El Compas project through its wholly owned Mexican subsidiary, Minera
Oro Silver de Mexico SA de CV (“Minera Oro Silver”).
The 3,990 hectare El Compas project in Zacatecas, Mexico consists of 28 concessions fully permitted for mining with 22 concessions subject
to a 1.5% net smelter return royalty and six concessions subject to a 3.0% net smelter return royalty.
Minera Oro Silver also holds a five year operating lease, renewable for an additional five years, on a 500 tpd ore processing plant located in
Zacatecas,  Mexico  for  a  total  annual  lease  cost  of  MXN  1,632,000  (approximately  $90,000),  adjusted  annually  for  inflation.  The  plant  is
currently not operational and will require capital investment to restore to an operational state. Preliminary capital investment estimates are $4.0
million to $6.0 million to recommence operations at the plant.
In July, the Company approved the contingent budget, as well as additional expenditures for the newly acquired El Compas project, of which
$6.7 million is budgeted for the second half of 2016. The Company now expects to spend $10.1 million on exploration this year including
29,400 metres of drilling, primarily at Terronera and secondarily at Guanaceví, El Cubo, El Compas and Guadalupe y Calvo. In addition to
exploration work focused on growing the Company’s silver and gold resources, the budget includes acquisitions, engineering and permitting
work pursuant to a pre-feasibility study for Terronera and a preliminary economic assessment for El Compas.
Consolidated Financial Results
Three months ended June 30, 2016 (compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015) 
For the three-month period ended June 30, 2016, the Company’s mine operating earnings were $12.9 million (Q2, 2015: $6.8 million) on sales
of $44.5 million (Q2, 2015: $47.7 million) with cost of sales of $31.6 million (Q2, 2015: $40.9 million).
The Q2, 2016 operating earnings were $7.8 million (Q2, 2015: $1.8 million) after exploration costs of $1.9 million (Q2, 2015: $2.5 million) and
general and administrative costs of $3.2 million (Q2, 2015: $2.5 million).
Earnings before taxes in Q2, 2016 were $5.6 million (Q2, 2015: $1.0 million) after finance costs of $0.3 million (Q2, 2015: $0.4 million), a
foreign exchange loss of $1.8 million (Q2, 2015: $0.7 million) and a loss in investment and other income and expenses of $0.1 million (Q2,
2015: investment and other income of $0.3 million. The Company realized net earnings for the period of $1.7 million (Q2, 2015: net loss of $1.0
million) after an income tax expense of $3.9 million (Q2, 2015: $2.0 million).
Sales of $44.5 million in Q2, 2016 represented a 7% decrease over the $47.7 million in sales for the same period in 2015. There was a 22%
decrease in silver oz sold and a 1% increase in the realized silver price resulting in a 21% decrease in silver sales, and there was an 11%
increase  in  gold  oz  sold  and  an  8%  increase  in  the  realized  gold  price  resulting  in  a  20%  increase  in  gold  sales.  During  the  period,  the
Company sold 1,493,790 oz silver and 15,364 oz gold, for realized prices of $16.54 and $1,289 per oz respectively, compared to sales of
1,912,595 oz silver and 13,797 oz gold, for realized prices of $16.34 and $1,191 per oz respectively, in the same period of 2015. The realized
prices of silver and gold during the period were within 3% of the average silver and gold spot prices during the period of $16.81 per oz and
$1,261 per oz, respectively, with differences due to the timing of sales and the mark-to-market adjustments for the concentrate sales that are
pending finalization and forward contracts.
13
The Company decreased its finished goods silver inventory to 154,273 oz and decreased its finished goods gold inventory to 1,124 oz at June
30, 2016 compared to 156,299 oz silver and 1,504 oz gold at March 31, 2016. The cost allocated to these finished goods was $3.1 million,
compared to $3.3 million at March 31, 2016. As of June 30, 2016, the finished goods inventory fair market value was $4.3 million compared to
$4.3 million at March 31, 2016.
Cost of sales for Q2, 2016 was $31.6 million, a decrease of 23% over the cost of sales of $40.9 million for the same period of 2015. The 23%
decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to cost reduction measures, the weakening of the Mexican peso against the US dollar and reduced
depletion due to accounting impairments recorded in 2015 that reduced the carrying value of the El Cubo operation.
Exploration  expenses  decreased  in  Q2,  2016  to  $1.9  million  from  $2.5  million  in  the  same  period  of  2015  based  on  reduced  exploration
activity. General and administrative expenses increased to $3.2 million for the period compared to $2.5 million in the same period of 2015. As
general and administrative expenses are largely incurred in Canadian dollars, the increased strength of the US dollar against the Canadian
dollar was offset by an increase in the fair market value of directors’ deferred share units.
The Company recorded a foreign exchange loss of $1.8 million during the period compared to a loss of $0.7 million for the same period of
2015. The $1.8 million loss was primarily due to the strengthening of the US dollar against the Mexican peso during the period, which resulted
in lower valuations on the Mexican peso cash and receivable amounts.
There was an income tax expense of $3.9 million during the period compared to an income tax expense of $2.0 million for the same period of
2015. The $3.9 million tax expense is comprised of $3.5 million in current income tax expense (Q2, 2015: $1.0 million) and $0.4 million in
deferred  income  tax  expense  (Q2,  2015  $1.0  million).  The  lower  operating  costs  positively  impacted  the  profitability  of  the  operations
increasing both the income tax expense and special mining duty compared to the same period in the prior year.
Six months ended June 30, 2016 (compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015)
For the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, the Company’s mine operating earnings were $19.2 million (Q2, 2015: $15.9 million) on sales
of $86.0 million (Q2, 2015: $98.8 million) with cost of sales of $66.8 million (Q2, 2015: $82.9 million).
Operating earnings were $10.9 million (Q2, 2015: $7.9 million) after exploration costs of $3.1 million (Q2, 2015: $3.6 million) and general and
administrative costs of $5.2 million (Q2, 2015: $4.4 million).
Earnings before taxes in Q2, 2016 were $8.8 million (Q2, 2015: $6.6 million) after finance costs of $0.6 million (Q2, 2015: $0.7 million), a
foreign exchange loss of $1.3 million (Q2, 2015: $1.3 million) and investment and other expenses of $0.2 million (Q2, 2015: investment and
other income of $0.7 million). The Company realized net earnings for the period of $3.5 million (Q2, 2015: $0.4 million) after an income tax
expense of $5.3 million (Q2, 2015: $6.2 million).
Sales of $86.0 million in the first half of 2016 represented a 13% decrease over the $98.8 million for the same period in 2015. There was a 20%
decrease in silver ounces sold and a 5% decrease in the realized silver price resulting in a 25% decrease in silver sales, and there was a 3%
increase in gold ounces sold and a 4% increase in realized gold prices resulting in an 8% increase in gold sales. During the period, the
Company sold 3,005,109 oz silver and 30,619 oz gold, for realized prices of $15.86 and $1,254 per oz respectively, compared to sales of
3,774,570 oz silver and 29,596 oz gold, for realized prices of $16.72 and $1,207 per oz respectively, in the same period of 2015. The realized
prices of silver and gold during the period were within 3% of the average silver and gold spot prices during the period of $15.86 per oz and
$1,254 per oz, respectively, with differences due to the timing of sales and the mark-to-market adjustments for the concentrate sales that are
pending finalization and forward contracts.
The Company decreased its finished goods silver inventory to 154,273 oz and increased its finished goods gold inventory to 1,124 oz at June
30, 2016 compared to 194,496 oz silver and 1,285 oz gold at December 31, 2015. The cost allocated to these finished goods was $3.1 million,
compared to $3.4 million at December 31, 2015. As of June 30, 2016, the finished goods inventory fair value was $4.3 million compared to the
fair value of $4.1 million at December 31, 2015.
14
Cost of sales for the first half of 2016 was $66.8 million, a decrease of 19% over the cost of sales of $82.9 million for the same period of 2015.
The 19% decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to cost reduction measures, the weakening of the Mexican peso against the US dollar
and  reduced  depletion  due  to  accounting  impairments  recorded  in  2015  that  reduced  the  carrying  value  of  the  El  Cubo  and  Bolañitos
operation.
Exploration expenses decreased in 2016 to $3.1 million from $3.6 million in the same period of 2015 based on the timing of the exploration
activities and the reduction of exploration activities. General and administrative expenses increased to $5.2 million for the period compared to
$4.4  million  in  the  same  period  of  2015.  As  general  and  administrative  expenses  are  largely  incurred  in  Canadian  dollars,  the  increased
strength of the US dollar against the Canadian dollar was offset by an increase in the fair market value of director’s deferred share units.
The Company experienced a foreign exchange loss of $1.3 million during the period compared to a loss of $1.3 million for the same period of
2015. The $1.3 million loss was primarily due to the strengthening of the US dollar against the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso during the
period, which resulted in lower valuations on the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso cash and receivable amounts.
There was an income tax expense of $5.3 million during the period compared to an income tax expense of $6.2 million for the same period of
2015. The $5.3 million tax expense was comprised of $4.9 million in current income tax expense (Q2, 2015: $4.1 million) and $0.4 million in
deferred income tax expense (Q2, 2015: $2.1 million deferred income tax recovery). The increase in the current income tax expense was
primarily due to the impact of the lower operating costs for the Company. In 2015, the Company recognized a $2.1 million deferred income tax
expense as a result of the falling Mexican peso, where as in 2016 the peso closed flat not impacting the deferred income taxes.
Non-IFRS Measures
Mine operating cash flow is a non-IFRS measure that does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be
comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Mine operating cash flow is calculated as revenue minus direct production costs
and royalties. Mine operating cash flow is used by management to assess the performance of the mine operations, excluding corporate and
exploration activities and is provided to investors as a measure of the Company’s operating performance.

EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure, which excludes the following from net earnings:
•
Income tax expense;
•
•
Finance costs;
Amortization and depletion
Adjusted EBITDA excluded the following additional items from EBITA
•
Share based compensation;
Management believes EBITDA is a valuable indicator of the Company’s ability to generate liquidity by producing operating cash flow to fund
working capital needs, service debt obligations, and fund capital expenditures. Management uses EBITDA for this purpose. EBITDA is also
frequently used by investors and analysts for valuation purposes whereby EBITDA is multiplied by a factor or “EBITDA multiple” based on an
observed or inferred relationship between EBITDA and market values to determine the approximate total enterprise value of a Company.
EBITDA is intended to provide additional information to investors and analysts and does not have any standardized definition under IFRS and
should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of operating performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. EBITDA
excludes the impact of cash costs of financing activities and taxes, and the effects of changes in operating working capital balances, and
therefore is not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined by IFRS. Other companies may calculate
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently.

Cash costs per ounce, total production costs per ounce and direct production costs per tonne are measures developed by precious metals
companies in an effort to provide a comparable standard; however, there can be no assurance that Endeavour’s reporting of these non-IFRS
measures are similar to those reported by other mining companies. Cash costs per ounce, production costs per ounce and direct production
costs per tonne are measures used by the Company to manage and evaluate operating performance at each of the Company’s operating
mining units, and are widely reported in the silver mining industry as a benchmark for performance, but do not have a standardized meaning
and are disclosed in addition to IFRS measures. The following tables provide a detailed reconciliation of these measures to Endeavour’s cost
of sales, as reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

(1) Special mining duty is an EBITDA royalty tax in Mexico presented as a current income tax in accordance with IFRS.

All-in sustaining costs per ounce and all-in costs per ounce are measures developed by the World Gold Council (and used as a standard of the
Silver Institute) in an effort to provide a comparable standard within the precious metal industry; however, there can be no assurance that
Endeavour’s reporting of these non-IFRS measures are similar to those reported by other mining companies. These measures are used by the
Company to manage and evaluate operating performance at each of the Company’s operating mining units and consolidated group, and are
widely reported in the silver mining industry as a benchmark for performance, but do not have a standardized meaning and are disclosed in
addition to IFRS measures. The following tables provide a detailed reconciliation of these measures to Endeavour’s cost of sales, as reported
in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Key Economic Trends
The prices of silver and gold are the largest single factor in determining profitability and cash flow from operations, therefore, the financial
performance of the Company has been, and is expected to continue to be, closely linked to the prices of silver and gold. During 2016, the
average price of silver was $15.67 per ounce, with silver trading between a range of $13.58 and $18.36 per ounce based on the London Fix
silver price. This compares to an average of $16.55 per ounce during first half of 2015, with a low of $15.47 and a high of $18.23 per ounce.
During the first half of 2016, the Company realized an average price of $15.86 per silver ounce compared with $16.72 for the corresponding
period in 2015.
During the first half of 2016, the average price of gold was $1,222 per ounce, with gold trading between a range of $1,077 and $1,324 per
ounce based on the London Fix PM gold price. This compares to an average of $1,206 per ounce during the first half of 2015, with a low of
$1,147 and a high of $1,295 per ounce. During 2016, the Company realized an average price of $1,254 per ounce compared with $1,207 for
the corresponding period in 2015.
During 2015, the average price of silver was $15.68 per ounce, with silver trading between a range of $13.71 and $18.23 per ounce based on
the London Fix silver price. This compares to an average of $19.08 per ounce during 2014, with a low of $15.28 and a high of $22.05 per
ounce. During 2015, the Company realized an average price of $15.79 per ounce compared with $18.76 for 2014.
During 2015, the average price of gold was $1,159 per ounce, with gold trading between a range of $1,049 and $1,296 per ounce based on the
London Fix PM gold price. This compares to an average of $1,266 per ounce during 2014, with a low of $1,142 and a high of $1,385 per
ounce. During 2015, the Company realized an average price of $1,148 per ounce compared with $1,273 for 2014.
The major influences on precious metals prices from Q2, 2014 to January 2016 included weaker investment demand, selling from precious
metal  exchange  traded  funds,  as  well  as  strong  US  equity  and  bond  markets  that  pulled  investments  from  other  asset  classes,  including
precious metals. In addition, precious metal prices were also affected by an expectation of improving economic conditions, which led to the
reduction of the US Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing program in 2014 and the anticipation of rising borrowing rates over the past two
years. Since February 2016, supply concerns, prevailing low to negative interest rates and uncertainty in the Eurozone since the Brexit vote
led to renewed investment demand in precious metals.
22
Currency Fluctuations
The  Company’s  operations  are  located  in  Mexico  and  therefore  a  significant  portion  of  operating  costs  and  capital  expenditures  are
denominated in Mexican pesos. The corporate activities are based in Vancouver, Canada with the significant portion of these expenditures
being denominated in Canadian dollars. Generally, as the US dollar strengthens, these currencies weaken, and as the US dollar weakens,
these currencies strengthen.
During the first half of 2016 the Mexican peso continued to depreciate with significant volatility against the US dollar. During 2016, the average
foreign exchange rate was $18.06 Mexican pesos per US dollar, with the peso trading within a range of $17.17 to $19.09. This compares to an
average of $15.13 during the first half of 2015, with a range of $14.52 to $15.71 Mexican pesos per U.S. dollar.
During 2015, the Mexican peso continued to depreciate against the US dollar with volatility increasing late in the year. The average foreign
exchange rate was $15.86 Mexican Pesos per US dollar, with the peso trading within a range of $14.52 and $17.39. This compared to an
average of $13.30 during 2014, with a range of $12.84 and $14.78 Mexican peso per US dollar.
During the first half of 2016, the Canadian dollar initially depreciate relative to the US dollar, however appreciated until the middle of the
second quarter. During 2016, the average foreign exchange rate was $1.3308 Canadian dollar per US dollar, with the Canadian dollar trading
within a range of $1.2533 and $1.4602. This compares to an average of $1.234 during the first half of 2015, within a range of $1.160 and
$1.278 Canadian dollar per U.S. dollar.
During  2015,  the  Canadian  dollar  depreciated  relative  to  the  US  dollar.  During  2015,  the  average  foreign  exchange  rate  was  $1.2774
Canadian dollar per US dollar, with the Canadian dollar trading within a range of $1.1599 and $1.3955. This compares to an average of
$1.1041 during 2014, with a range of $1.0627 and $1.1643 US dollar per Canadian dollar.
23
Cost Trends
The Company’s profitability is subject to industry wide cost pressures on development and operating costs with respect to labour, energy,
consumables and capital expenditures. Underground mining is labour intensive and approximately 33% of Endeavour’s production costs are
directly  tied  to  labour.  In  order  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  higher  labour  and  consumable  costs,  the  Company  focuses  on  continuous
improvement, both by promoting more efficient use of materials and supplies, and by pursuing more advantageous pricing, while increasing
performance and without compromising operational integrity. Over the past eight quarters, the Company has benefitted from its continuous
improvement programs, a depreciating Mexican peso, reduction of contractors and a decrease in cost pressures as metal prices fell.
24
2016 Outlook
Production 
In January, the Company publicly guided silver production of 4.9 to 5.3 million oz and gold production of 40,000 to 43,000 oz for fiscal 2016.
The projected decrease in production compared to 2015 was due to the Company’s focus on minimizing all-in sustaining costs and improving
after-tax  free  cash  flow  rather  than  maintaining  metal  output.  Since  January,  rising  precious  metal  prices,  stronger  cash  flows  and  two
successful equity offerings prompted the Company to revises its capital and exploration budgets in the second half of 2016 and as well as its
production guidance. Management now expects silver production of 5.5 to 6.0 million oz and gold production of 49,000 to 54,000 oz in fiscal
2016.
At Guanaceví, throughput of 1,085 tonnes per day in the first half of 2016 lagged behind plan as a new mining contractor focused on mine
development in order to provide better stope access for the second half of 2016. In July, management announced production would likely meet
the low end of the range of the January 2016 production guidance and revised its production range lower to 2.9 to 3.1 million oz of silver and
and 6,000 to 7,000 oz of gold. Production in the second half is expected to average plant capacity of 1,200 tpd primarily from the Santa Cruz,
Porvenir Norte, and Porvenir Centro deposits.
At Bolañitos, throughput averaging 1,502 tpd in the first half of 2016 exceeded plan as mining at LL- Asunción uncovered new extensions of
the  orebody  beyond  the  resource  blocks  and  also  in  and  around  historic  mine  workings.  Management  has  revised  the  2016  production
guidance higher to 0.9 million to 1 million oz silver and 24,000 to 26,000 oz gold, with throughput still expected to decline to 800 tpd in H2,
2016 as originally guided.
At El Cubo, throughput was above plan in the first half of 2016 at 1,730 tpd as management elected to continue ore development sufficient to
sustain 1,500 tpd in Q2, 2016 and 1,000 tpd in H2, 2016 given the rising precious metal prices. In July the Company made a decision not to
ramp  down  production  to  care  and  maintenance  by  year-end  as  previously  guided,  and  various  operating  plans  are  under  evaluation  for
production to return to 1,500 tpd with additional mine development. Management has revised the 2016 production guidance higher to 1.7
million to 1.9 million silver ounces and 19,000-21,000 gold ounces.

Operating Costs 
Consolidated cash costs of production, net of gold by-product credits, was guided to be $8-9 per oz of silver in 2016, slightly higher than the
2015 cash costs due to the lower value of the gold credit assumption. Consolidated cash costs on a co-product basis are anticipated to be
$10.50 -$11.50 per oz silver and $800-$850 per oz gold. Cash costs have been lower than the expected due to higher gold prices, while cash
costs have aligned on a co-product basis. Management expects costs on a per ounce basis to be slightly higher in the second half of the year.
All-in sustaining cost (AISC) of production, net of gold by-product credits, in accordance with the World Gold Council standard, was guided to
be $12-13 per oz of silver in 2016, substantially lower than our estimated 2015 AISC due to the lower Mexican peso to U.S. dollar exchange
rate and lower sustaining capital and exploration investments. When non-cash items such as stock based compensation are excluded, AISC,
net of gold by-product credits, is forecast in the $11.50 -$12.50 range. The higher gold credit resulted in lower AISC for the first half of the year.
Management expects AISC to increase in the second half of the year with the increase in mine development and exploration expenditures.
Direct operating costs were guided to be in the $77-81 per tonne range for the year. The direct operating costs were expected to be higher in
the second half of the year therefore should align to the lower part of management guidance for the year.
25
Capital Investments 
In January, the Company guided capital expenditures totaling $11.3 million in 2016, primarily for mine development at Guanaceví, in order to
access reserves for mining and replace reserves by converting measured and indicated resources. A contingent budget was also prepared to
invest $4.5 million on additional mine development at Guanaceví, subject to financing plus small capital investments at Bolañitos and El Cubo
subject to higher metal prices. Endeavour has therefore revised its 2016 capital investment guidance as follows:

At Bolañitos, the Company plans a $1.7 million capital investment in H2, 2016 to develop the Plateros orebody located 50 metres from the
existing LL-Ascuncion mine workings. The development will access an indicated resource of over 130,000 tonnes grading 116 g/t silver and
1.61 g/t gold, still open at depth. Underground drilling is planned to continue exploring the mineralized zone once underground access is
available.
At El Cubo, the Company will invest $1.6 million in H2, 2016 to extend the V- Asunción ramp an additional 1.6 km in order to access an
indicated resource of more than 300,000 tonnes grading 141 g/t silver and 1.55 g/t gold. The V- Asunción orebody extends well south of the
current mine plan but further evaluation work is needed before Endeavour can commit to any additional development.
Exploration Expenditures 
In January, the Company guided exploration expenditures totaling $2.5 million on exploration drilling at Guanaceví and property holding costs
in Mexico, with a contingent budget to invest an additional $7.0 million on additional exploration, engineering and land acquisition, primarily at
Terronera, subject to financing. Endeavour’s cash and working capital positions grew substantially during the first half of 2016 due to higher
metal prices, stronger cash flows, and the “At-The-Market” equity offerings.
In July, the Company approved the contingent budget, as well as additional expenditures for the newly acquired El Compas project, of which
$6.7 million is budgeted for the second half of 2016. The Company now expects to spend $10.1 million on exploration this year including
29,400 metres of drilling, primarily at Terronera and secondarily at Guanaceví, El Cubo, El Compas and Guadalupe y Calvo. In addition to
exploration work focused on growing the Company’s silver and gold resources, the budget includes acquisitions, engineering and permitting
work pursuant to a pre-feasibility study for Terronera and a preliminary economic assessment for El Compas.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash  and  cash  equivalents  significantly  increased  from  $20.4  million  at  December  31,  2015  to  $56.8  million  at  June  30,  2016,  while  the
amount drawn on the credit facility decreased by $8.0 million to $14.0 million. The Company had working capital of $72.1 million at June 30,
2016 (December 31, 2015 - $17.3 million). The $54.8 million increase in working capital was primarily due to $39.7 million gross proceeds
from equity offerings, $5.3 million from proceeds of exercised stock options with the remainder primarily generated from operating activities.
Operating activities generated cash of $7.4 million during the first half of 2016 compared to generating $23.3 million during the same period in
2015. The significant non-cash adjustments to the net income of $3.5 million were amortization and depletion of $9.4 million, share-based
compensation of $1.9 million, finance costs of $0.6 million, and a change in non-cash working capital of $9.5 million. The change in non-cash
working capital was primarily due to payment of income taxes and special mining duty during the period and the increase in trade receivables
and decrease in accounts payable, offset by a decrease in inventories.
Investing activities during the period used $6.6 million compared to $18.0 million in the same period of 2015. The investments in 2016 primarily
relate to mine development at Guanaceví, offset by proceeds on the sale of available for sale assets and a return of a long term deposit. In
2015, the Company invested similarly at each operation.
Capital spending totalled $7.2 million in property, plant and equipment during 2016. $6.3 million was invested at Guanaceví, with $5.5 million
spent on 4.1 kilometres of mine development and $0.1 million spent on the tailings dam and $0.7 million spent on various equipment. At
Bolañitos, the Company invested $0.3 million on tailings expansion and various equipment. At El Cubo, the Company invested $0.1 million on
various items. The Company spent $0.5 million on capitalized exploration and corporate equipment.
On May 27, 2016, the Company issued 2,147,239 common shares to Canarc and assumed Canarc’s obligation to pay an aggregate of 165 troy
ounces of gold to Marlin Gold Mining Ltd to acquire a 100% interest in Canarc’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Oro Silver Resources Ltd, which
owns the El Compas project through its wholly owned Mexican subsidiary, Minera Oro Silver. The 3,990 hectare El Compas project located in
Zacatecas, Mexico consists of 28 concessions fully permitted for mining with 22 concessions subject to a 1.5% net smelter return royalty and
six  concessions  subject  to  a  3.0%  net  smelter  return  royalty.  Minera  Oro  Silver  also  holds  a  five  year  operating  lease,  renewable  for  an
additional  five  years,  on  a  500  tpd  ore  processing  plant  located  in  Zacatecas,  Mexico  for  a  total  annual  lease  cost  of  MXN  1.6  million
(approximately $90 thousand), adjusted annually for inflation.
Financing activities during 2016 increased cash by $35.7 million, compared to reducing cash by $4.5 million during the same period in 2015.
During  2016  the  Company  paid  $8.0  million  to  reduce  its  credit  facility,  paid  $0.4  million  in  interest,  paid  debt  re-structuring  costs  of  $0.4
million, reduced its finance lease obligation by $0.4 million, received proceeds of $5.3 million from exercised stock options and raised gross
proceeds through at-the-market offerings of $41.1 million with $1.4 million in share issue costs. By comparison, during 2015, the Company
paid $0.2 million in interest and reduced its credit facility by $4.0 million.
In July 2014, the Company filed a short form base shelf prospectus (the “Base Shelf”) that qualifies the distribution of up to CDN$ 200 million of
common shares, warrants or units of the Company comprising any combination of common shares and warrants (“Securities”). The distribution
of  Securities  may  be  effected  from  time  to  time  in  one  or  more  transactions  at  a  fixed  price  or  prices,  which  may  vary  with  market  prices
prevailing at the time of sale, or at prices related to such prevailing market prices to be negotiated with purchasers and as set forth in an
accompanying prospectus supplement, including transactions that are deemed to be at the market distributions. The Base Shelf also provided
the Company with the ability to conduct an “At-The-Market” offering through an “At-The-Market” facility (“ATM”) equity distribution agreement.
On November 25, 2015, the Company entered into an ATM facility with Cowen and Company, LLC, acting as sole agent. Under the terms of
this ATM facility, we may, from time to time, sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering value of up to US$16.5 million on
the New York Stock Exchange. The Company determines, at its sole discretion, the timing and number of shares to be sold under this ATM
facility. A prospectus supplement to the Base Shelf was filed on November 25, 2015 to qualify the shares to be sold under the ATM facility up
to a maximum of $16.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company issued 799,569 common shares under the ATM
facility at an average price of $1.43 per share for net proceeds of $1.1 million.
27
During 2016, the Company completed this ATM facility issuing 7,218,125 common shares at an average price of $2.13 per share for proceeds
of $14.9 million, net of commission. Under this ATM Facility the Company issued a total of 8,017,694 shares for net proceeds of $16.0 million.
The  common  shares  were  issued  in  at-the-market  distributions  on  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange  pursuant  to  the  effective  registration
statement on Form F-10, which registers the offer and sale of the common shares under the ATM facility.
In May 2016, the Company filed a short form base shelf prospectus that qualifies the distribution of up to CAN $175 million common shares,
warrants or units of the Company comprising any combination of common shares and warrants (“Securities”). The distribution of Securities may
be effected from time to time in one or more transactions at a fixed price or prices, which may vary with market prices prevailing at the time of
sale, or at prices related to such prevailing market prices to be negotiated with purchasers and as set forth in an accompanying prospectus
supplement, including transactions that are deemed to be ATM distributions.
On May 5, 2016, the Company entered into a second ATM equity facility with Cowen and Company, LLC, acting as sole agent. Under the
terms of this ATM facility, the Company may, from time to time, sell common stock having an aggregate offering value of up to US$40.0 million
on the New York Stock Exchange. The Company determines, at its sole discretion, the timing and number of shares to be sold under the ATM
facility. From launch to the period ended June 30, 2016, the Company had 7,056,388 common shares issued or issuable under the ATM facility
at an average price of $3.65 per share for proceeds of $25 million, net of commission.
During  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2016,  the  Company  also  recognized  $788  of  additional  transaction  costs,  related  to  the  two  ATM
financings, as share issuance costs.
Subsequent to June 30, 2016, the Company substantially completed the second ATM by issuing an additional 3,188,959 shares under the
ATM facility at an average price of $4.46 per share for proceeds of $13.9 million, net of commission.
The  Company  believes  operating  cash  flow  and  existing  working  capital  will  be  sufficient  to  cover  2016  capital  requirements  and
commitments. See the 2016 Outlook section on page 25 for further discussion.
As at June 30, 2016 the Company’s issued share capital was $422.5 million, representing 120,983,022 common shares (December 31, 2015:
$368.9 million representing 102,776,470 common shares).
As at June 30, 2016, the Company had options outstanding to purchase 6,492,250 common shares with a weighted average exercise price of
CAN $3.93. Subsequent to period end, 1,471,500 options were exercised with a weighted average price of CAN $4.05.
On  January  19,  2016,  the  Company  signed  an  amended  and  restated  credit  facility  (“the  Amended  Facility”)  to  convert  the  remaining
outstanding balance under the existing revolving credit facility into a two year facility amortized quarterly and maturing on December 31, 2017.
The Amended Facility came into effect April 1, 2016 on completion of precedent conditions. The Amended Facility is principally secured by a
pledge  of  the  Company’s  equity  interests  in  its  material  operating  subsidiaries,  including  Refinadora  Plata  Guanaceví  SA  de  CV,  Minas
Bolañitos SA de CV and Compania Minera del Cubo SA de CV. The interest rate margin on the Amended Facility is be 4.5% over LIBOR and
the Company agreed to pay a fee of $300,000 upon signing. The Facility and subsequent Amended Facility are subject to the same qualitative
and quantitative covenants, including a debt to EBITDA leverage ratio, an interest service coverage ratio and a tangible net worth calculation.
At June 30, 2016, the Company had $14 million outstanding on the Amended Facility. (December 31, 2015 -$22 million).

Contingencies 
Minera Santa Cruz y Garibaldi SA de CV (“MSCG”), a subsidiary of the Company, received a MXN$238 million assessment on October 12,
2010 by Mexican fiscal authorities for failure to provide the appropriate support for certain expense deductions taken in MSCG’s 2006 tax
return, failure to provide appropriate support for loans made to MSCG from affiliated companies, and deemed an unrecorded distribution of
dividends to shareholders, among other individually immaterial items. MSCG immediately initiated a Nullity action and filed an administrative
attachment to dispute the assessment.
In June 2015, the Superior Court ruled in favour of MSCG on a number of the matters under appeal; however, the Superior Court ruled against
MSCG for failure to provide appropriate support for certain deductions taken in MSCG’s 2006 tax return. In June 2016, the Company received a
MXN$123 million assessment, which includes interest and penalties by Mexican fiscal authorities for failure to provide the appropriate support
for certain expense deductions taken in MSCG’s 2006 tax return, failure to provide appropriate support for loans made to MSCG from affiliated
companies, and deemed an unrecorded distribution of dividends to shareholders, among other individually immaterial items. If MSCG agrees
to pay the tax assessment, or a lesser settled amount, it is eligible to apply for forgiveness of 100% of the penalties and 50% of the interest,
with the latter amounting to MXN $53.4 million (~USD $2.9 million) on the MXN $46.5 million estimated tax assessment.
Included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, are net assets of $240,000, including $42,000 in cash, of MSCG. Following the
Tax Court’s rulings, MSCG is in discussions with the tax authorities with regards to the shortfall of assets within MSCG to settle its estimated
tax  liability.  An  alternative  settlement  option  would  be  to  transfer  the  shares  and  assets  of  MSCG  to  the  tax  authorities.  The  Company
recognized  an  allowance  for  transferring  the  shares  and  assets  of  MSCG  amounting  to  $240,000.  The  Company  is  currently  assessing
MSCG’s settlement options, however the Tax Court assessment must be received before any negotiation can be finalized or a decision is
made.
On acquisition of the El Cubo operation, under the terms of the acquired Las Torres lease, the Company was required to provide financial
guarantees to the owner of the Las Torres Facility as security against any environmental damages. As at June 30, 2016, there was a $1 million
letter of credit provided by the Company as security to the owner of the Las Torres facility that expires on August 14, 2018.
Capital Requirements
In January, the Company guided capital expenditures totaling $11.3 million in 2016, primarily for mine development at Guanaceví, in order to
access reserves for mining and replace reserves by converting measured and indicated resources. A contingent budget was also prepared to
invest $4.5 million on additional mine development at Guanaceví, subject to financing plus small capital investments at Bolañitos and El Cubo
subject to higher metal prices. Endeavour revised its 2016 capital investment guidance as follows:

At Bolañitos, the Company plans a $1.7 million capital investment in H2, 2016 to develop the Plateros orebody located 50 metres from the
existing LL-Ascuncion mine workings. The development will access an indicated resource of over 130,000 tonnes grading 116 g/t silver and
1.61 g/t gold, still open at depth. Underground drilling is planned to continue exploring the mineralized zone once underground access is
available.
At El Cubo, the Company will invest $1.6 million in H2, 2016 to extend the V- Asunción ramp an additional 1.6 km in order to access an
indicated resource of more than 300,000 tonnes grading 141 g/t silver and 1.55 g/t gold. The V- Asunción orebody extends well south of the
current mine plan but further evaluation work is needed before Endeavour can commit to any additional development.
29
In the first half of 2016, capital spending totalled $7.2 million in property, plant and equipment during 2016. Of this, $6.3 million was invested at
Guanaceví, with $5.5 million spent on 4.1 kilometres of mine development,$0.1 million spent on the tailings dam and $0.7 million spent on
various equipment. At Bolañitos, the Company invested $0.3 million on tailings expansion and various equipment. At El Cubo, the Company
invested $0.1 million on various items. The Company spent $0.5 million on capitalized exploration and corporate equipment.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy establishes three levels to classify the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair
value. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices in
markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable
for the asset liability (for example, interest rate and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, forward pricing curves used to value
currency and commodity contracts and volatility measurements used to value option contracts), or inputs that are derived principally from or
corroborated by observable market data or other means. Level 3 inputs are unobservable (supported by no or little market activity). The fair
value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level inputs and the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.
Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include:

The Company holds marketable securities classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy and as available for sale financial assets. The fair
values of available for sale investments are determined based on a market approach reflecting the closing price of each particular security at
the reporting date. The closing price is a quoted market price obtained from the stock exchange that is the principal active market for the
particular security, being the market with the greatest volume and level of activity for the assets. Changes in fair value on available-for sale
marketable securities are recognized in other comprehensive income or loss, unless there is objective evidence of impairment.
31
Trade receivables
The trade receivables consist of receivables from provisional silver and gold sales from the Bolañitos and El Cubo mine. The fair value of
receivables arising from concentrate sales contracts that contain provisional pricing mechanisms is determined using the appropriate quoted
closing  price  on  the  measurement  date  from  the  exchange  that  is  the  principal  active  market  for  the  particular  metal.  As  such,  these
receivables, which meet the definition of an embedded derivative, are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Derivative instruments
Derivative instruments, including embedded derivatives, are recorded on the statement of financial position at fair value. Changes in the fair
value of derivative instruments are recognized in net earnings.
As at June 30, 2016, the Company had a derivative liability of $1.4 million related to the change in fair value for the forward sale to be settled in
Q3, 2016 of 878,190 ounces of silver and 980 ounces of gold. The change in the fair value has been recognized as a reduction of revenue for
the Guanaceví mine.
Financial Instrument Risk Exposure and Risk Management
The  Company  is  exposed  in  varying  degrees  to  a  variety  of  financial  instrument  related  risks.  The  Board  approves  and  monitors  the  risk
management process. The types of risk exposure and the way in which such exposure is managed is provided as follows:
Credit Risk 
The Company is exposed to credit risk on its bank accounts, investments and accounts receivable. Credit risk exposure on bank accounts and
short  term  investments  is  limited  through  maintaining  the  Company’s  balances  with  high-credit  quality  financial  institutions,  maintaining
investment policies, assessing institutional exposure and continual discussion with external advisors. Value added tax (“IVA”) receivables are
generated on the purchase of supplies and services to produce silver which are refundable from the Mexican government. Trade receivables
are generated on the sale of concentrate inventory to reputable metal traders.
Liquidity Risk 
The Company ensures that there is sufficient capital in order to meet short term business requirements. The Company’s policy is to invest cash
at floating rates of interest, while cash reserves are to be maintained in cash equivalents in order to maintain liquidity after taking into account
the Company’s holdings of cash equivalents, money market investments, marketable securities and receivables. The Company believes that
these sources, operating cash flow and its policies will be sufficient to cover the likely short term cash requirements and commitments.
Market Risk 
The significant market risk exposures to which the Company is exposed are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, and commodity price risk.
Foreign Currency Risk – The Company’s operations in Mexico and Canada make it subject to foreign currency fluctuations. Certain of the
Company’s operating expenses are incurred in Mexican pesos and Canadian dollars; therefore the fluctuation of the US dollar in relation to
these currencies will consequently have an impact upon the profitability of the Company and may also affect the value of the Company’s
assets and the amount of shareholders’ equity. The Company has not entered into any agreements or purchased any instruments to hedge
possible currency risks.
Interest Rate Risk – In respect of financial assets, the Company’s policy is to invest cash at floating rates of interest and cash reserves are to
be maintained in cash equivalents in order to maintain liquidity. Fluctuations in interest rates impact the value of cash equivalents. The Facility
is subject to interest rate risk as amounts outstanding are subject to charges at a LIBOR-based rate payable according to the quoted rate term.
The interest rate charge for the period was approximately 4%. As at June 30, 2016, with other variables unchanged, a 1% increase in the
LIBOR rate would be result in additional interest expense of $140,000.
32
Commodity Price Risk – Gold and silver prices have historically fluctuated significantly and are affected by numerous factors outside of the
Company’s  control,  including,  but  not  limited  to  ,  industrial  and  retail  demand,  central  bank  lending,  forward  sales  by  producers  and
speculators, levels of worldwide production, short-term changes in supply and demand because of speculative hedging activities and certain
other factors. The Company has not engaged in any hedging activities, other than short term metal derivative transactions less than 90 days, to
reduce its exposure to commodity price risk. At June 30, 2016 there are 242,306 ounces of silver and 2,735 ounces of gold which do not have
a final settlement price and the estimated revenues have been recognized at current market prices. As at June 30, 2016, with other variables
unchanged, a 10% decrease in the market value of silver and gold would result in a reduction of revenue of $0.8 million.
Outstanding Share Data
As of August 2, 2016, the Company had the following securities issued and outstanding:
•
•
•
125,643,481 common shares
425,000 performance share units
5,020,750 common shares issuable under stock options with a weighted average exercise price of CAN$3.90 per share expiring
between May 23, 2017 and May 13, 2020.
The Company considers the items included in the consolidated statement of shareholders’ equity as capital. The Company’s objective when
managing capital is to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and
benefits for other stakeholders. The Company manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic
conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may issue new
shares  through  private  placements,  prospectus  offerings,  convertible  debentures,  asset  acquisitions  or  return  capital  to  shareholders.  The
Company is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Changes in Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates
Accounting standards adopted during the period:
Amendments to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements (“IAS 1”) 
On December 18, 2014, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 as part of its major initiative to improve presentation and disclosure in financial
reports. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016 with early adoption permitted. The Company
intends to adopt these amendments in its financial statements for the annual period beginning on January 1, 2016. The Company does not
anticipate this amendment to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
Changes in IFRS not yet adopted:
New standards and amendments have been proposed; however, they do not impact the condensed consolidated interim financial statements
and are not anticipated to impact the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements. The nature and impact of each new standard and
amendment applicable to the Company are described below:
Amendments to IAS 7, Statement of Cash Flows (“IAS 7”) 
On January 7, 2016, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 7. The amendments apply prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after
January 1, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The amendments require disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate
changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flow and non-cash changes. The Company
intends to adopt the amendments to IAS 7 in its financial statements for the annual periods beginning on January 1, 2017. The extent of the
impact of adoption of the amendments has not yet been determined.
33
Amendments to IAS 12, Income Taxes (“IAS 12”) 
On January 19, 2016, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 12. The amendments apply retrospectively for annual periods beginning on or after
January 1, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The amendments clarify that the existence of a deductible temporary difference depends solely
on a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset and its tax basis at the end of the reporting period, and is not affected by possible future
changes in the carrying amount or expected manner of recovery of the asset. The amendments also clarify the methodology to determine future
income tax profits used for assessing the utilization of deductible temporary differences. The Company intends to adopt the amendments to
IAS 12 in its financial statements for the annual period beginning on January 1, 2017. The extent of the impact of adoption of the amendments
has not yet been determined.
Amendments to IFRS 2, Share-based Payment (“IFRS 2”) 
On June 20, 2016, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 2 clarifying how to account for certain types of share-based payment transactions.
The amendments provide requirements on the accounting for: the effects of vesting and non-vesting conditions on the measurement of cash-
settled share-based payments; share-based transactions with a net settlement feature for withholding tax obligations; and a modification to the
terms and conditions of a share-based payment that changes the classification of a transaction from cash-settled to equity settled.
The amendments apply for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. As a practical simplification, the amendments can be applied
prospectively. Retrospective, or early, application is permitted if information is available without the use of hindsight. The Company intends to
adopt the amendments to IAS 2 in its financial statements for the annual period beginning on January 1, 2018. The extent of the impact of
adoption of the amendments has not yet been determined.
IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (“IFRS 9”) 
In  November  2009,  the  IASB  issued  IFRS  9, Financial Instruments,  as  the  first  step  in  its  project  to  replace  IAS  39 Financial  Instruments:
Recognition and Measurement. On July 24, 2014 the IASB issued the complete IFRS 9. IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement
model and establishes two primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortized cost and fair value. The basis of classification
depends on an entity’s business model and the contractual cash flows of the financial asset. Classification is made at the time the financial
asset is initially recognized, namely when the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
IFRS 9 amends some of the requirements of IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, including added disclosures about investments in
equity  instruments  measured  at  fair  value  in  OCI,  and  guidance  on  the  measurement  of  financial  liabilities  and  de-recognition  of  financial
instruments. The mandatory effective date of IFRS 9 is for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 with early adoption permitted.
The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting IFRS 9 on its consolidated financial statements, including the applicability of early
adoption.
IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“IFRS 15”) 
On May 28, 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 15. The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 with early
adoption permitted. IFRS 15 will replace IAS 11 Construction Contracts, IAS 18 Revenue, IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes, IFRIC 15
Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate,  IFRIC  18 Transfer of Assets from Customers  and  SIC  31 Revenue  – Barter  Transactions
Involving Advertising Services.
The standard contains a single model that applies to contracts with customers and two approaches to recognizing revenue: at a point in time or
over  time.  The  model  features  a  contract-based  five-step  analysis  of  transactions  to  determine  whether,  how  much  and  when  revenue  is
recognized.  New  estimates  and  judgmental  thresholds  have  also  been  introduced,  which  may  affect  the  amount  and/or  timing  of  revenue
recognized.
On April 12, 2016 the IASB issued Clarifications to IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which is effective at the same time as
IFRS 15. The clarifications to IFRS 15 provide additional guidance with respect to the five-step analysis, transition, and the application of the
standard to licenses of intellectual property.
The  Company  intends  to  adopt  IFRS  15  and  the  clarifications  in  its  consolidated  financial  statements  for  the  annual  period  beginning  on
January 1, 2018. The extent of the impact of adoption of the standard has not yet been determined.

IFRS 16, Leases (“IFRS 16”) 
On January 13, 2016, the IASB published a new standard, IFRS 16, Leases, eliminating the current dual accounting model for lessees, which
distinguishes between on-balance sheet finance leases and off-balance sheet operating leases. Under the new standard, a lease becomes an
on-balance sheet liability that attracts interest, together with a new right-of-use asset. In addition, lessees will recognize a front-loaded pattern
of expense for most leases, even when cash rentals are constant. IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1,
2019,  with  earlier  adoption  permitted.  The  Company  has  not  yet  completed  an  assessment  of  the  impact  of  this  standard  on  its  financial
statements.
The  Company  has  not  early  adopted  any  other  standard,  interpretation  or  amendment  in  the  condensed  consolidated  interim  financial
statements that have been issued, but not yet effective.
Critical Accounting Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements requires the Company to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Significant areas requiring the use of management judgement relate to the determination of mineralized reserves,
plant and equipment lives, estimating the fair values of financial instruments and derivatives, estimating the fair value of convertible debenture
components, impairment of non-current assets, reclamation and rehabilitation provisions, recognition of deferred tax assets, and assumptions
used in determining the fair value of non-cash share-based compensation.
Critical judgments in applying policies that have a significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for the
period include the following:
•
Acquisition of Oro Silver Resources Ltd. – critical judgments include the determination of asset purchase versus business combination
in respect of the Company’s acquisition of Oro Silver Resources Ltd. during the period. In making its determination, the Company
considered established mineral resources associated with the El Compas property and other contracts assumed in the transaction
See “Critical Accounting Estimates” in the Company’s annual MD&A for a detailed discussion of the other areas in which critical accounting
estimates are made.
