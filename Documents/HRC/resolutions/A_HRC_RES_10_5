<p><b>    Tenth Session

<p><b>Resolution 10/5.  Composition of staff of the Office of the United Nations 
   High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>paragraph 5 (g) of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, in 
which the Assembly decided that the Council should assume the role and responsibilities of 
the Commission on Human Rights relating to the work of the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights, as decided by the Assembly in its resolution 48/141 of 
20 December 1993, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note </i>of all relevant resolutions on this issue adopted by the General Assembly, the 
Commission on Human Rights and the Council, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note also </i>of the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
on the composition of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner (A/HRC/10/45), 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note further</i> of the reports of the Joint Inspection Unit on the follow-up to the 
management review of the Office of the High Commissioner (A/59/65-E/2004/48 and Add.1) 
and on the funding and staffing of the Office (JIU/REP/2007/8), 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>that an imbalance in the composition of the staff could diminish the 
effectiveness of the work of the Office of the High Commissioner if it is perceived to be 
culturally biased and unrepresentative of the United Nations as a whole, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing</i> its concern that, despite the repeated requests to correct the unbalanced 
geographical distribution of the staff, the situation remains that one region accounts for more 
than half of the posts of the Office of the High Commissioner and for more posts than the four 
remaining regional groups combined, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming </i>the importance of continuing the ongoing efforts to address the imbalance 
regarding the regional representation of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner, 
</p>
<p> <i>Underlining</i> that the paramount consideration for employing staff at every level is the need 
for the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity, and taking into account 
Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, expressing its conviction that this 
objective is compatible with the principle of equitable geographical distribution, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the 
General Assembly entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters, </p>

<p> </p>
<p> 2

Rights in her report that achieving geographical balance in the staff of the Office of the High 
Commissioner will remain one of her priorities, and requests the High Commissioner to continue 
to take all measures needed to redress the current imbalance in geographical distribution of the 
staff of the Office; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Notes</i> the increase in the percentage of staff from regions identified as requiring

</p>
<p> 4. <i>Requests </i>the High Commissioner to work on the broadest geographic diversity of her 
staff by enhancing the implementation of measures to achieve a better representation of countries 
and regions that are unrepresented or underrepresented, particularly from the developing world, 
while considering applying a zero-growth cap on the representation of countries and regions 
already overrepresented in the Office of the High Commissioner; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Welcomes</i> the efforts made towards the achievement of a gender balance in the 
composition of the staff and the decision to continue to pay special attention to this issue; 
</p>

made in the fulfilment of the goal of a geographical balance in the composition of the staff of the

recruitment of and promotion to high-level and Professional posts, including senior managers, as 
a principle of the staffing policies of the Office of the High Commissioner; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Affirms </i>the vital importance of geographical balance in the composition of the staff 
of the Office of the High Commissioner, taking into account the significance of national and 
regional specificities and various historic, cultural and religious backgrounds, as well as of 
different political, economic and legal systems, to the promotion and protection of the 
universality of human rights; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Recalls </i>the provisions contained in section X, paragraph 3, of General Assembly 
resolution 55/258 of 14 June 2001, on human resources management, in which the Assembly 
reiterated its request to the Secretary-General to increase further his efforts to improve the 
composition of the Secretariat by ensuring a wide and equitable geographical distribution of staff 
in all departments, and also recalls the request that he submit to the General Assembly proposals 
for a comprehensive review of the system of desirable ranges, with a view to establishing a more 
effective tool to ensure equitable geographic distribution in relation to the total number of staff 
of the Secretariat; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Encourages </i>the General Assembly to consider further measures for promoting 
desirable ranges of geographical balance in the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner </p>
