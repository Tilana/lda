JUDGMENT OF FINNIGAN J

This is an application by the 1st Defendant for an order striking out Plaintiffs statement of claim. It was filed in August 1999.

In the meantime the Plaintiff has died and the executor and trustee of his estate was substituted as Plaintiff by order on 27 March 2000. No party has filed any documents other than that order the affidavit of service of that order and the submissions filed on behalf of the 1st Defendant in support of this application. The correct Plaintiff in the action now pursuant to the order made in March 2000 is as above. 

On 3 June 2005 the Plaintiff sought a hearing and two dates were allocated, 4 July 2006 and 2 October 2006. In the meantime this interlocutory motion was to be disposed of and I programmed submissions. Of the Defendants only the first filed submissions and the Plaintiff has not replied. I had previously directed the Plaintiff to file and serve an affidavit by 4.00pm on 19 May 2005 and that did not occur either.

The Plaintiff may well have conceded the 1st Defendants point. I can proceed only on the basis of the 1st Defendants submissions. 

I accept all the submissions filed on behalf of the 1st Defendant. I accept that the law requires me not to strike out actions except in plain and obvious cases, wherein a Plaintiff clearly has no chance of success. I accept there is no jurisdiction pursuant to S. 105 (8) (e) of the Property Law Act Cap 130. I accept also that on the affidavit evidence there is no viable cause of action against the 1st Defendant. 

The case against the 2nd Defendant follows. The action is struck out. I make no order for costs.
