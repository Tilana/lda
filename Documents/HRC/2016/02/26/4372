outstanding contribution to the creation of a non-racial, non-sexist, democratic South 
Africa,

<p><i>Recognizing also </i>Nelson Mandela&#8217;s values and his dedication to the service 
of humanity, as a humanitarian, in the fields of conflict resolution, race relations, 
promotion and protection of human rights, reconciliation, gender equality and the 
rights of children and other vulnerable groups, as well as the upliftment of poor and 
underdeveloped communities,  
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> General Assembly resolution 64/13 of 10 November 2009, in 
which the Assembly proclaimed 18 July Nelson Mandela International Day, to be
