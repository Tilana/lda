<p><b>  Report of the Independent Expert on human rights and 
international solidarity, Virginia Dandan 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Preliminary text of a draft declaration on the right of peoples 
and individuals to international solidarity 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Preambular Paragraphs 
</b></p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the Preamble of the Charter of the United Nations, in particular the 
determination by States to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and 
worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and 
small; to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising 
from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained; to promote social 
progress and better standards of life in larger freedom; and to employ international 
machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that there is an overwhelming collective manifestation of international 
solidarity by States as expressed in the multitude of commitments and promises relating to 
human rights and development that they have made most notably the adoption of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of 
Action in 1993, the Declaration on the Right to Development in 1986 and the Millennium 
Declaration in 2000, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the recognition as set forth in the declaration adopted by the heads of State 
and Government at the Millennium Summit of the United Nations of the fundamental value 
of solidarity to international relations in the twenty-first century, stating that: global 
challenges must be managed in a way that distributes costs and burdens fairly, in 
accordance with basic principles of equity and social justice; those who benefit least, 
deserve help from those who benefit most; responsibility for managing worldwide 
economic and social development, as well as threats to international peace and security, 
must be shared among the nations of the world and should be exercised multilaterally;1 in 
addition to their separate responsibilities to their individual societies, they have a collective 
responsibility to uphold the principles of human dignity, equality and equity at the global 
level; 2as well as the resolve to create an environment &#8211; at the national and global levels 
alike &#8211; which is conducive to development and to the elimination of poverty,3 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling further</i> that the World Conference on Human Rights where States adopted 
the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action in June 1993, contains various references 
to notions of international cooperation and solidarity; thus, in the preamble, respect for the 
principles of &#8220;peace, democracy, justice, equality, rule of law, pluralism, development, 
better standards of living, and solidarity&#8221; is cited and strengthened by the determination &#8220;to

<p>take new steps forward in the commitment of the international community with a view to 
achieving substantial progress in human rights endeavours by an increased and sustained 
effort of international cooperation and solidarity,&#8221; 
</p>
<p> <i>Considering</i> that in development forums, States are increasingly developing 
consensus around the notion of mutual accountability,4 described at the Busan High Level 
Forum on Aid Effectiveness as the need for accountability to the intended beneficiaries of 
our cooperation, as well as to our respective citizens, organizations, constituents and 
shareholders.&#8221;5 
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> that international solidarity is a fundamental conception of mutually 
reinforcing relations among persons, groups and nations; as an essential binding element 
that underpins global partnerships; a key approach to poverty eradication; and an 
indispensable component of the efforts to realize all human rights, including the right to 
development, and the Millennium Development Goals, 
</p>
<p> <i>Affirming</i> that international solidarity is not limited to international assistance and 
cooperation, aid, charity or humanitarian assistance; that it is a broader concept and 
principle that includes sustainability in international relations, especially international 
economic relations, the peaceful coexistence of all members of the international 
community, equal partnerships and the equitable sharing of benefits and burdens,6 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking into account </i>the repeated emphasis on the importance of cooperation by the 
General Assembly contained in its resolution 60/251 and in the preamble recognizing that 
&#8220;the promotion and protection of human rights should be based on the principles of 
cooperation and genuine dialogue and aimed at strengthening the capacity of Member 
States to comply with their human rights obligations for the benefit of all human beings&#8221;, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reiterating</i> the commitment of States expressed in the last paragraph of the 
Millennium Declaration: &#8220;The United Nations is the indispensable common house of the 
entire human family, through which we will seek to realize our universal aspirations for 
peace, cooperation and development. We therefore pledge our unstinting support for these 
common objectives and our determination to achieve them.&#8221;7 
</p>
<p><b> II. Preliminary Operational Paragraphs 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Article 1 
</b></p>
<p>1. International solidarity is the union of interests, purposes and actions between and 
among peoples, individuals, States and their international organizations, to preserve the 
order and the very survival of international society, and to achieve common goals that 
require international cooperation and collective action based on the international normative 
system of obligations, duties and responsibilities, which they implement and practice to 
foster peace and security, development and human rights, in accordance with the Charter of 
the United Nations.

<p>2. International solidarity is evident in the actions collectively undertaken by States, 
that have a positive impact on the exercise and enjoyment of human rights by peoples and 
individuals within and outside of their respective territories, particularly in matters 
pertaining <i>inter alia </i>to bilateral and multilateral trade, investment, taxation, finance, 
environmental protection, and development cooperation. 
</p>
<p>3. These actions include ratification by States of the United Nations international 
human rights treaties; the commitments, agreements and pledges adopted and agreed upon 
between and among States at the intergovernmental, regional and international levels; the 
measures and policies by each State in relation to its foreign relations including its actions 
within international organizations; and its domestic measures and policies that arise from, 
or that inform their international commitments.  
</p>
<p>4. International solidarity responds to the need for transformative change that 
encompasses the objectives of equity, sustainability, security and empowerment that are 
applicable to all countries, not only developing countries.  
</p>
<p><b>  Article 2 
</b></p>
<p>1. Preventive solidarity aims at overcoming the root causes of poverty, inequality and 
gender imbalances, implying that States fully respect and comply with their obligations 
under international law, pledged at the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>2. Preventive solidarity is essential to the achievement of both intergenerational and 
intra-generational solidarity and is a vital component of the duty of State to provide and 
seek international cooperation for the purpose of assistance in the implementation of its 
human rights obligations, particularly for its most vulnerable and marginalized peoples and 
individuals. 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 3 
</b></p>
<p> International solidarity is also evident in the actions across borders undertaken 
together by peoples and individuals, the former being interpreted to include groups, 
associations, organizations, civil society, and those that are not accommodated in dominant 
paradigms, but that share similar values and concerns and are structured in some way8 such 
as those in: 
</p>
<p>(a) Local and grassroots communities, who are unrepresented in and isolated 
from, mainstream civil societies and organizations;  
</p>
<p>(b) Social spheres that transcend national borders such as transnational 
communities, and diaspora communities among others; 
</p>
<p>(c) Transnational advocacy networks including those that participate in domestic 
and international activities simultaneously, bound by shared values and discourses, and who 
engage in dense exchanges of information and services;9 and, 
</p>
<p>(d) Virtual communities of differently situated individuals who are linked 
through the Internet and who together, consequently develop similar world views.

<p><b>  Article 4 
</b></p>
<p> As such, the general objective of international solidarity is to create an enabling 
environment where all human rights including the right to development, can be 
progressively realized for all peoples and individuals, through effective multilateral 
preventive solidarity measures undertaken by States and international organizations, in 
active partnerships with each other and with peoples and individuals who constitute the 
international society with a view to: 
</p>
<p>(a) Preventing and removing the root causes of the asymmetries and inequalities 
between developed and developing countries and populations, as well as the structural 
obstacles that generate poverty worldwide; and,  
</p>
<p>(b) Fostering the equitable, just and fair distribution of benefits in a globalized 
world through the protection and promotion of all human rights.  
</p>
<p><b>  Article 5 
</b></p>
<p> The right to international solidarity encompasses and bears upon: 
</p>
<p>(a) The fulfilment of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United 
Nations in the true spirit of oneness and harmony; 
</p>
<p>(b) Adherence to the principles of justice, equity, peaceful coexistence, non-
interference, self-determination, mutual respect and accountability in international 
relations; 
</p>
<p>(c) The right to development as a common concern of humanity to be realized 
based on partnerships and the mutual recognition of responsibility and accountability of all 
partners; 
</p>
<p>(d) Equitable, just and fair partnerships of States as the basis of international 
cooperation with regard to international assistance, official development aid, and other 
international cooperation agreements in the contemporary circumstances of globalization 
and growing interdependence; 
</p>
<p>(e) The permanent sovereignty of each State over its own natural wealth and 
resources; 
</p>
<p>(f) The right and the responsibility of each State and its peoples to determine 
freely their own objectives of social development, to set their own priorities and to decide, 
in conformity with the principles of the Charter of the United nations, the means and 
methods of their achievement, without any external interference;10 
</p>
<p>(g) The responsibilities of the multiple non-State actors in the development 
process; 
</p>
<p>(h) The primary responsibility of States in meeting their respective national 
human rights obligations as well as the extraterritorial obligations jointly shared with other 
States; 
</p>
<p>(i) The accountability of all States to their peoples with regard to the 
implementation of their foreign policy, bilateral, regional and international agreements and 
partnerships;

<p>(j) The accountability of all States before international structures and 
mechanisms such as, <i>inter alia</i>, the Universal Periodic Review and the United Nations 
human rights treaty bodies, and the supporting national policies aiming to respect, protect, 
promote, and fulfil human rights, including respect for cultural diversity and the right to 
peace; 
</p>
<p>(k) Good practices of collective action on the ground &#8211; whether among 
individuals, peoples or States &#8211; that give rise to desirable outcomes in advancing the respect 
for, protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without 
distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion; 
</p>
<p>(l) The achievement of gender equality in all sustainable development 
initiatives, including in areas related to climate change, water management, renewable 
energy generation, access to resources, services, social protection, education and markets; 
</p>
<p>(i) The structural analysis and consequent dismantling of the root causes that 
perpetuate discrimination against women resulting in poverty and in the violation of 
women&#8217;s human rights; 
</p>
<p>(j) Global partnerships aimed at achieving the United Nations Development 
Agenda before and beyond 2015. 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 6 
</b></p>
<p>1. The right to international solidarity is a fundamental human right which peoples and 
individuals have the freedom to enjoy, on the basis of equality and non-discrimination, the 
benefits of a harmonious international society with a just and fair international political and 
economic order, in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms may be fully 
realized.11  
</p>
<p>2. Everyone holds in common the birthright of human rights that link peoples and 
individuals together in solidarity, across cultural diversities and variations in language, 
religion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status, and therefore entitles 
everyone to the freedom to exercise and enjoy the right of peoples and individuals to 
international solidarity, and to participate and contribute to its full realization in accordance 
with applicable international human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>3. The right of peoples and individuals to international solidarity draws on the human 
rights norms and principles already codified in international legal instruments reflecting 
core economic, social and cultural rights as well as civil and political rights, and the right to 
development.  
</p>
<p>4. The right of peoples and individuals to international solidarity therefore consists of 
their entitlements along with the obligations of States that are well-established in 
international human rights treaties, with the addition of common but differentiated 
responsibilities arising from interactions in the various relevant fields at the national, 
regional and international level.  
</p>
<p>5. The right to international solidarity guarantees that peoples and individuals should 
benefit from the fulfilment of commitments, agreements and pledges arranged and agreed 
upon between and among States at the bilateral, intergovernmental, regional and 
international levels.

<p><b>A/HRC/26/34/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Article 7 
</b></p>
<p> Peoples and individuals have the right, individually and in association with others 
within their territories and beyond national boundaries, and as provided for in human rights 
and other applicable international instruments: 
</p>
<p>(a) To seek, obtain, receive and impart to others, information about their right to 
international solidarity, and to have access to knowledge about how this right and its related 
freedoms, are given effect in domestic and international legislative, judicial or 
administrative systems; 
</p>
<p>(b) To establish political spaces domestically or transnationally, in which actors 
in different situations and locations can peacefully share and disseminate information, 
interact with each other, negotiate and undertake&#8212;formally or informally&#8212;their social, 
cultural, and political interests, in order to foster the respect, protection and fulfilment of all 
human rights for all;  
</p>
<p>(c) To form, join, interact with, and participate in organizations, virtual 
networks, or in groups, on the regional and international levels, for the purpose of 
advocating and influencing policy decisions and outcomes that affect them, and of 
monitoring compliance by States with their international human rights obligations, and non-
State international actors with their responsibilities and ethics of conduct.  
</p>
<p>(d) To seek redress before national and international human rights mechanisms, 
where failure by States to fulfil their commitments made at the regional and international 
levels, results in deprivation and/or violations of human rights.  
</p>
<p><b>  Article 8 
</b></p>
<p>1. International cooperation among States is an integral part of the right to international 
solidarity, as a complement to the primary responsibility of each State to implement their 
national human rights obligations, with the effective and immediate fulfilment of core 
obligations as a priority, while at the same time taking concrete, deliberate and targeted 
steps with the maximum of available resources, to move expeditiously towards the 
progressive realization of human rights, including the right to development.  
</p>
<p>2. The duty of international cooperation rests on the premise that some members of the 
international community may not possess the resources necessary for the full realization of 
rights set forth in international human rights treaties, and that States in a position to do so 
should provide international assistance, acting separately and jointly, to contribute to the 
fulfilment of human rights in other States, in a manner consistent with the fundamental 
principles of international human rights law: non-discrimination and equality including 
gender equality, participation, transparency and accountability.  
</p>
<p><b>  Article 9 
</b></p>
<p> The right to international solidarity entails a human rights based approach to 
international cooperation and all global partnerships in responding to global challenges 
such as those relating to global governance, regulation and sustainability in the fields of 
climate change, the environment, humanitarian assistance, trade, finance, taxation, debt 
relief, human trafficking, dumping of toxic wastes, social protection, universal health 
coverage, reproductive and sexual health, food security, water management, renewable 
energy resources, social standards, migration and labour, and strengthening participatory </p>

</p>
<p>global governance in order to address structural inequalities such as gender inequality, and 
in creating a global enabling environment for a people-centred development. 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 10 
</b></p>
<p>1. The right to international solidarity requires that international cooperation should be 
based on equal partnerships, mutual commitments and obligations, including mutual 
accountability enhanced through transparency in the use of development resources obtained 
through international cooperation, and joint assessment of mutual progress.  
</p><p>2. The right to international solidarity in international cooperation, holds partner States 
accountable to each other and to their respective constituents at the national level, for the 
outcomes of policies, strategies and performance at the bilateral, regional and international 
level, which should reflect the best interests of their peoples.  
</p>
<p><b>  Article 11 
</b></p>
<p>1. States should strive for the fulfilment of the right to peace, for friendly relations and 
cooperation with each other, irrespective of differences in their cultural, social, economic 
and political systems and for the peaceful settlement of international disputes without 
resorting to or threatening the use of force. 
</p>
<p>2. The right to international solidarity holds inviolable the right of each State and 
peoples to determine freely their own objectives of social development, to set their own 
priorities and to decide, in conformity with the principles of the Charter of the United 
Nations, the means and methods of their achievement without any external interference. 
</p>
<p>3. In light of the common challenges of humankind in the contemporary world, the 
right to international solidarity requires States to act with common but differentiated 
responsibilities, taking into account their historical advantages and contributions to the 
challenges facing humanity. 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 12 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the elaboration and implementation of international agreements and related 
standards, States must ensure that the procedures and outcomes are fully compliant with 
their human rights obligations, including those relating to international trade, investment, 
finance, taxation, environmental protection, development cooperation, and security, with a 
view to creating an international enabling environment conducive to the universal 
fulfillment of human rights. 
</p>
<p>2. As a member of an international organization, the State continues to be responsible 
for its own conduct in relation to its human rights obligations within and outside its 
territory, and therefore should ensure that the relevant international organization acts 
consistently with the State&#8217;s international human rights obligations12 including its 
extraterritorial obligations. 
</p>
<p>3. It is the responsibility of States to cooperate in creating mechanisms on the national, 
regional and international levels, to hold accountable all relevant actors &#8211; State and non-

and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 13 
</b></p>
<p>1. States should respect and protect <i>inter alia</i>, the rich variety and diversity in the 
cultures of peoples and individuals who make up international society and the reciprocal 
influences they exert on one another, their right to participate in decision-making from the 
local to the international levels, their access to communication and free exchange of 
information without unnecessary restrictions, and the privacy of the individual.  
</p>
<p>2. States should ensure that there is a balanced gender representation in States&#8217; 
delegations to diplomatic and international decision-making forums, on all issues and 
levels, and not just on women&#8217;s rights. 
</p><p>3. States should cooperate jointly, to address the intersection of gender based 
discrimination, poverty, socio-economic marginalization and violence, as well as the links 
among trafficking in human beings, corruption, terrorism, militarism, trade in small arms, 
and gender-based violence, and devote sustained and consistent attention to the issue of 
women and girls in all situations of vulnerability and multiple forms of discrimination who 
are particularly at risk of gender-based violence. 
</p>
<p>4. The right to international solidarity requires that States engaged in actions of 
international cooperation should refrain from imposing conditions that would hinder the 
exercise and enjoyment by peoples and individuals of their human rights. 
</p><p>5. States should respect, protect and promote good practices of peaceful and productive 
collective action &#8211; whether among individuals, peoples or among States &#8211; that give rise to 
desirable outcomes in advancing all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all. 
</p>
<p>6. States should respect and protect the right of peoples and individuals exercise their 
right to seek, obtain, receive and impart to others, information about the right to 
international solidarity, including through giving effect to this right in domestic and 
international legislative, judicial or administrative systems; 
</p><p>7. States should respect, protect and ensure the right of peoples and individuals to 
access remedies and redress through national and international human rights mechanisms, 
when the failure of States to fulfil their commitments made at the regional and international 
levels, results in deprivation and violations of human rights.  
</p>
<p>8. The right to international solidarity imposes on States particular negative obligations 
required by applicable international human rights instruments including:  
</p>
<p>(a) Not adopting free trade agreements that would undermine peoples&#8217; 
livelihoods or other rights; 
</p>
<p>(b) Not increasing or contributing to global warming;  
(c) Not causing the depletion of or irreparable damage to natural resources; 
(d) Not engaging in irregular weapons trading; and  
(e) Not impeding access to information and communications technology.
