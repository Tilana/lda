<p><b>  Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p><b>  28/34 . Prevention of genocide 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided </i>by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, 
</p>
<p>and other relevant international instruments,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> its resolutions 7/25 of 28 March 2008 and 22/22 of 22 March 2013 on the 
</p>
<p>prevention of genocide, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the significance<b> </b>of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of 
</p>
<p>the Crime of Genocide, adopted on 9 December 1948 and succeeded by the adoption of the 
</p>
<p>Universal Declaration of Human Rights on the next day, as an effective international 
</p>
<p>instrument for the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that the crime of genocide is recognized in the Convention as an 
</p>
<p>odious scourge that has inflicted great losses on humanity, and that further international 
</p>
<p>cooperation is required to facilitate the timely prevention and punishment of the crime of 
</p>
<p>genocide,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> about the occurrence in recent history of genocide, recognized as 
</p>
<p>such by the international community, on the basis of and as defined in the Convention, and 
</p>
<p>bearing in mind that massive, serious and systematic violations of human rights and 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law might result in genocide,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Taking into consideration</i> that States parties to the Convention on the Non-
</p>
<p>Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity of 26 
</p>
<p>November 1968 have agreed that no statutory limitation shall apply to such crimes, 
</p>
<p>including the crime of genocide, irrespective of the date of their commission,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Affirming</i> that impunity for the crime of genocide, war crimes and crimes against 
</p>
<p>humanity encourages their occurrence and is a fundamental obstacle to the furtherance of 
</p>
<p>cooperation among peoples and the promotion of international peace and security, and that 
</p>
<p>fighting impunity for such crimes is an important factor in their prevention,<b> 
</b></p>
<p> 
United Nations A/HRC/RES/28/34 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>General Assembly 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>

<p><i>Condemning </i>impunity for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, and 
</p>
<p>emphasizing the responsibility of States to comply with their obligations under relevant 
</p>
<p>international instruments to end impunity and, to that end, to thoroughly investigate and 
</p>
<p>prosecute persons responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes or other 
</p>
<p>massive, serious or systematic violations of human rights and international humanitarian 
</p>
<p>law in order to avoid their recurrence and to seek sustainable peace, justice, truth and 
</p>
<p>reconciliation,<b> </b>and in this regard stressing also the importance of strengthening the capacity 
</p>
<p>of domestic jurisdictions and inter-State cooperation, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> the significant progress made by the international community, 
</p>
<p>including within the United Nations system, in developing relevant mechanisms and 
</p>
<p>practices to prevent and punish the crime of genocide, thereby contributing to the effective 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Convention,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>General Assembly resolution 96 (I) of 11 December 1946, in which the 
</p>
<p>Assembly declared genocide a crime under international law, and all subsequent resolutions 
</p>
<p>within the United Nations system that have contributed to the establishment and 
</p>
<p>development of the process of prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide, 
</p>
<p>including Assembly resolution 60/1 of 16 September 2005,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Acknowledging with appreciation </i>that genocide is defined among the most serious 
</p>
<p>crimes of concern to the international community as a whole in the Rome Statute of the 
</p>
<p>International Criminal Court, and also acknowledging the role of the Court and other 
</p>
<p>relevant international criminal tribunals in helping to increase accountability for the crime 
</p>
<p>of genocide,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> the importance of the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees 
</p>
<p>of non-recurrence to the prevention of genocide, and also stressing that perpetrators of this 
</p>
<p>crime should be held criminally accountable on the national or international level,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> the work of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, 
</p>
<p>justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence and its positive impact on the 
</p>
<p>prevention of gross violations of human rights and serious violations of international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law through a holistic approach to transitional justice, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging also </i>the reports of the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights on the right to the truth,1 and encouraging States to 
</p>
<p>cooperate with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and 
</p>
<p>guarantees of non-recurrence, 
</p>
<p><i>Encouraging</i> States to promote the ascertainment of the truth by appropriate means 
</p>
<p>as an important element in combating impunity and promoting accountability as part of the 
</p>
<p>prevention of genocide and comprehensive reconciliation,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that an important factor for the prevention of genocide is the 
</p>
<p>identification of the root causes of genocide, as well as early warning signs, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting with concern</i> that attempts to deny or to justify the crime of genocide, as 
</p>
<p>defined in the Convention and established as such under international law, may risk 
</p>
<p>undermining the fight against impunity, reconciliation and efforts to prevent genocide, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that the Human Rights Council was mandated by the General Assembly to 
</p>
<p>address situations of violations of human rights, including gross and systematic violations, 
</p>
<p>and to make recommendations thereon, and that it should also promote the effective 
</p>
<p>coordination and mainstreaming of human rights in the United Nations system,<b> 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>

<p><i>Recognizing</i> the important contribution of the United Nations human rights system 
</p>
<p>to efforts towards preventing situations in which the crime of genocide could be committed,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> its full support for the mandate of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-
</p>
<p>General on the Prevention of Genocide, who acts as, inter alia, an early warning mechanism 
</p>
<p>to prevent potential situations that could result in genocide,<b>

<p><i>Taking note</i> of the new framework of analysis for atrocity crimes developed by the 
</p>
<p>Office of the Special Advisers on the Prevention of Genocide and on the Responsibility to 
</p>
<p>Protect as one of the tools to assess the risk of genocide in any situation, and encouraging 
</p>
<p>Member States and regional and subregional organizations to use relevant frameworks, as 
</p>
<p>appropriate, for guidance in their prevention work,<b> 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>General submitted to the Human Rights Council on the implementation of the Five-Point

</p>
<p>in the prevention of genocide and response to situations that may lead to genocide, and 
</p>
<p>taking note in this respect of the establishment of the Regional Committee for the
