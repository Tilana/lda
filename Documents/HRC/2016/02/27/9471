<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> This report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council decision 1/102 and 
considers one of the issues of special concern to the Special Rapporteur on the right to education: 
the right of persons with disabilities to inclusive education.  The right to inclusive education 
implies that it is possible for all children and young people, regardless of their situations or 
differences, to learn together.  The paradigm of inclusive education is a response to the 
limitations of traditional education, which has been described as patriarchal, utilitarian and 
segregational, as well as to the shortcomings of special education and policies to integrate 
learners with special needs into mainstream educational systems. 
</p>
<p> The concept of inclusive education is contained implicitly in article 13, paragraph 1, of 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and articles 23 and 29 of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, and expressly, inter alia, in the Salamanca Statement and 
Framework for Action on Special Needs Education adopted in 1994 by the World Conference on 
Special Needs Education:  Access and Quality and the recently adopted Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which establishes the obligation of States to ensure an 
inclusive education system. 
</p>
<p> The report recommends a series of legislative, policy and financial measures that need to 
be adopted in order to give effect to this right.  It also identifies some of the obstacles that 
prevent the fulfilment of the right to inclusive education, as indicated in the responses submitted 
by various States and non-governmental organizations to a questionnaire, sent out by the Special 
Rapporteur, the purpose of which was to assess the degree to which international standards are 
being implemented in this area.  Among other obstacles, it cites the discrepancy that exists 
between the normative framework and the resources available for realizing the right to inclusive 
education, as well as the lack of genuine political will to achieve this goal. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. By its resolution 1998/33, the Commission on Human Rights established the mandate of 
the Special Rapporteur on the right to education.  In 2004, the Commission renewed the mandate 
for a period of three years, by its resolution 2004/25.  The present report is submitted in 
accordance with paragraph 12 of Commission resolution 2005/21 as well as decision 1/102 of 
the Human Rights Council in which the Council decided to extend exceptionally for one year, 
subject to the review to be undertaken by the Council in conformity with General Assembly 
resolution 60/251, the mandates and the mandate-holders of all the special procedures of the 
Commission on Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>2. In the past year, the Special Rapporteur carried out a broad and intensive programme of 
work that included frequent trips undertaken at the invitation of Governments, universities and 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) for the purpose of conducting activities related to his 
mandate.  He also carried out a mission to Germany in January and another to Morocco in 
November and December.  The Special Rapporteur sent letters of allegation to the Governments 
of Burundi, Chile, China, Poland, Romania, the Russian Federation and Slovenia, but received 
replies only from the Governments of Chile, China and Romania. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur decided to devote his third annual report to the question of the 
right to education of persons with disabilities, given that his work principally involves 
addressing the needs of persons subjected to discrimination, among whom persons with 
disabilities are one of the groups most affected by exclusion from education.  Moreover, the 
General Assembly&#8217;s adoption on 13 December 2006 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities, article 24 of which recognizes the right to education of such persons, is a 
development of particular concern to the Special Rapporteur.  Consequently, this report seeks to 
strengthen the impact and promote the ratification and implementation of that Convention and to 
encourage efforts to implement, among other relevant instruments, the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the 
Convention against Discrimination in Education, which was adopted by the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). 
</p>
<p>4. In the efforts to promote the right to education, organizations of persons with disabilities 
and their families have proved to be a bastion for the advancement of the rights of persons with 
disabilities.  This report recognizes and pays tribute to their achievements.  The Special 
Rapporteur wishes to express his thanks for the contributions from the Latin American Forum 
for Educational Policies (FLAPE), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR) and Inclusion International (International League of Associations for 
Persons with Mental Disabilities), which greatly facilitated his work. 
</p>
<p>5. In cooperation with the Special Rapporteur, OHCHR organized a seminar, involving a 
multidisciplinary panel of experts, on &#8220;The right to education of persons with disabilities&#8221;.  The 
seminar was held on 23 and 24 November 2006 and had two principal aims:  to assist the Special 
Rapporteur in his exploration of the various opportunities and numerous challenges regarding the 
right to education of persons with disabilities; and to promote active and effective monitoring of 
its fulfilment.  From that seminar it became clear that there is a common and multidisciplinary 
agreement that the fulfilment of the right to education depends on &#8220;inclusive education&#8221;, a 
concept which forms the focus of this report. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>6. The remaining structure of the report reflects this focus and is divided into 
seven sections.  Section one introduces the concept of inclusive education as the main 
characteristic of the right to education for persons with disabilities.  Section two briefly 
considers the applicable normative framework to inclusive education from the perspective of 
both treaty law and programmatic declarations.  Section three identifies and considers specific 
treaty obligations and responsibilities of States (and indeed other actors) pertinent to the right to 
education of persons with disabilities, and introduces - but only as an outline - the minimum 
requirements of legislative, policy and financial frameworks needed to fulfil these obligations.  
Section four examines the main challenges to inclusive education, followed by section five, 
which briefly reviews the main bodies that have a role to play in monitoring the fulfilment of the 
right.  It also introduces the importance of the prompt development and agreement on the right to 
education indicators and benchmarks.  Section six sums up responses to a questionnaire sent out 
by the Special Rapporteur to Governments and civil society organizations.  These responses are 
noted with gratitude at this point as they actively informed the entire report.  Concluding 
observations and recommendations form section 7. 
</p>
<p><b>I. THE RIGHT TO INCLUSIVE EDUCATION 
OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES 
</b></p>
<p>7. That persons with disabilities, of both genders and all ages, have a right to education 
cannot now be disputed.  Unfortunately, neither can it now be disputed that persons with 
disabilities, of both genders and all ages and in most parts of the world, suffer from a pervasive 
and disproportionate denial of this right.  The impact of a denial of education, generally at all 
ages and in all spheres of life, has been powerfully demonstrated in previous reports of the 
Special Rapporteur on the right to education.  As the estimate of persons with disabilities is 
between 500 and 600 million persons (of which 120 to 150 million are children, 80 to 90 per cent 
of whom live in poverty in developing countries) and some 15 to 20 per cent of all students have 
been estimated as having special needs at some point in their educational careers,<b>1</b> the current 
and potential future impact is both unacceptable and causes considerable concern. 
</p>
<p>8. Inadequate State monitoring of the education of persons with disabilities has led to 
uncertainty as to the exact level of their exclusion from education.  Nonetheless, the statistics 
that do exist indicate a simply unacceptable extent and breadth of such exclusion across all age 
ranges and both sexes and, indeed, within the disability &#8220;community&#8221; itself.  Two simple 
examples will suffice to illustrate this point.  First, while the net enrolment rate in primary 
education in the developing world has now increased to 86 per cent over all regions,<b>2</b> estimates

<p>of the number of children with disabilities attending school in developing countries range from 
less than 1 per cent to 5 per cent.<b>3</b>  Second, literacy rates for disabled women are 1 per cent, as 
compared to an estimate of about 3 per cent for people with disabilities as a whole.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>9. In response to this exclusion, a strengthening partnership of the &#8220;human rights&#8221; and 
&#8220;disability&#8221; movements has promoted the educative paradigm now generally known, and 
referred to above, as inclusive education.  Inclusive education is based on the principle that all 
children should learn together, wherever possible, regardless of difference.<b>5</b>  Inclusive education 
acknowledges that every child has unique characteristics, interests, abilities and learning needs 
and that those learners with special education needs must have access to and be accommodated 
in the general education system through a child-centred pedagogy.  Inclusive education, by 
taking into account the diversity among learners, seeks to combat discriminatory attitudes, create 
welcoming communities, achieve education for all as well as improve the quality and 
effectiveness of education of mainstream learners.<b>6</b>  In this way, educational systems should no 
longer view persons with disabilities as problems to be fixed; instead, they should respond 
positively to pupil diversity and approach individual differences as opportunities to enrich 
learning for all.<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>10. The concept of inclusive education involves two closely related processes:  on the one 
hand, it questions traditional (patriarchal, utilitarian and segregational) education and, on the 
other, it refers to a specific mechanism that seeks to provide appropriate and relevant education 
for persons with disabilities and other groups subjected to discrimination, which is why it aspires 
to become a systemic and systematic model.  Having established this, it is clear that, as inclusive 
education pursues its unstoppable course, school loses the sterile, catalytic meaning that has been 
ascribed to it for centuries and is now being called upon to change radically. 
</p>
<p>11. In direct contrast with this there is the &#8220;special education&#8221; paradigm.  Policies following 
this paradigm promote segregated education that leads to the development of separate 
educational systems:  one for persons with disabilities, often referred to as &#8220;special schools&#8221;; and

<p>one for those without disabilities, or &#8220;mainstream&#8221; schools.  The special schools, often based on 
the belief that persons with disabilities are uneducable and a burden on the mainstream 
educational system, often were - and remain - inflexible, non-individual-student specific and 
they fail to provide or even offer optimum results for their students.  The negative impact of 
these beliefs is reflected on national and international educative assessments.  The consequence 
is that mainstream &#8220;schools are pushing out those scores that do not measure up to performance 
goals, resulting in a reluctance to include students with disabilities and to expel students whom 
they find difficult to teach&#8221;.<b>8</b>  In addition, the practice of separating students with disabilities can 
lead to greater marginalization from society, a situation that persons with disability face 
generally, thus entrenching discrimination.  In contrast, inclusive education has been shown to 
limit marginalization.  This marginalization contributes to misconceived stereotyping, prejudice 
and thus discrimination.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>12. Transition from segregated, special education, to inclusive education is not a simple 
exercise, and the complex issues it raises must be both acknowledged and squarely faced.  
Corners cannot be cut.  For example, &#8220;integration&#8221;, often in the guise, or in the place, of true 
inclusion in education, has created its own difficulties.  Attempts to a simple integration into 
mainstream schools without accompanying structural changes (for instance, organization, 
curriculum and teaching and learning strategies) have been shown, and will continue for a 
variety of reasons, to fail to meet the educational rights of persons with disabilities.  Indeed, 
integration may simply lead to exclusion in the mainstream rather than in the special schools.  It 
is clear, therefore, that current and future education policy must identify and remedy all 
structural biases leading to potential exclusion in the mainstream education system.  Policies and 
resources aimed at developing genuinely &#8220;inclusive&#8221; practices must take precedence over the old 
practices. 
</p>
<p>13. Inclusive education challenges the appropriateness of segregated education both on the 
grounds of effectiveness as well as from the perspective of respect for human rights.<b>10</b>  As to 
effectiveness, current research suggests that, within the realm of education, States are 
increasingly realizing the inefficiency of multiple systems of administration, organizational

</p>
<p>structures and services, and specifically the lack of financial viability of special schools.<b>11</b>  
It has further been suggested that inclusive education can be both cost-efficient and 
cost-effective.<b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>14. True access is, as noted by the predecessor of the Special Rapporteur, a vital component 
of the right to education for students with and without disabilities and implicates factors both 
external and personal to each student.  A combination of unaddressed external and personal 
factors specific to persons with disabilities has frequently led to a total denial of their access to 
education, inclusive or otherwise.  Simple but effective measures needed to address these factors 
have been noted elsewhere on numerous occasions.  As these measures are too often ignored, a 
non-exhaustive list, more pertinent to inclusion, is given here with the aim of reiterating their 
importance.  To overcome external factors limiting access to education, they include altering the 
physical environment, such as the design of hallways and classrooms, desks, widening entrances, 
building ramps, installation of elevators, altering or reconsidering geographical locations, 
adapting rules and admission standards; and personal factors, such as the provision of 
supplementary classes, alternative/additional forms of communication, special tutors or support 
staff, and nutritious meals. 
</p>
<p>15. Two disparate but important points are made to conclude this section.  First, inclusive 
education should be viewed under an expansive perspective, embracing lifelong learning, 
stretching from early childcare to vocational training, basic education for adults to life-skills 
education for older persons.  Secondly, States must both respect the liberty of parents to choose 
schools for their children with disabilities,<b>13</b> and the right of those children to express, and have 
heard, their own views in such matters.<b>14</b> 
</p>
<p><b>II. THE RIGHT TO INCLUSIVE EDUCATION -  
NORMATIVE FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p>16. The aim of this section is simply to introduce the applicable normative framework of 
inclusive education:  it is by no means exhaustive, as it can readily be found elsewhere.  As 
noted by numerous commentators, States first recognized the human right to education 
internationally in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948.  In 1960, 
UNESCO adopted its Convention against Discrimination in Education.  Several binding

 <p> 
</p>
<p>instruments followed, the most pertinent for this report being the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in 1966.  Article 13 of the Covenant gave further detail to 
the Universal Declaration by formally acknowledging the right of everyone to free and 
compulsory primary education as well as, progressively, to free secondary and tertiary education.  
This acknowledgement was reiterated in article 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
some 23 years later. 
</p>
<p>17. Although these instruments do not refer explicitly to inclusive education, certain 
elements of the right to education implicitly serve to promote the concept.  Notably, article 13 of 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights highlights education&#8217;s role 
of enabling, &#8220;all persons to <i>participate effectively </i>in a free society&#8221; [emphasis added].  Again, 
the principle was reiterated in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, but this time more 
explicitly in its articles 29 and 23:  the former by focusing on the purposes of education and the 
latter, relating specifically to children with disabilities, by imposing an obligation on States to 
ensure that children with disabilities have &#8220;effective access to and receive education, training, 
health-care services, rehabilitation services, preparation for employment and recreation 
opportunities in a manner conducive to the child&#8217;s achieving the fullest possible social 
integration and individual development&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>18. The principal applicable programmatic frameworks include the World Conference on 
Education for All, held in Jomtien, Thailand, in 1990, which set the now well-known goal of 
&#8220;education for all&#8221;, promoting equity and universal access to education.  In a further 
development, the Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with 
Disabilities were adopted in 1993, focusing, as their title suggests, on the &#8220;equalization of 
opportunities and participation in all aspects of society&#8221; for persons with disabilities.  The 
Salamanca Statement on Principles, Policy and Practice in Special Needs Education of UNESCO 
followed in 1994, asserting that education for all could not be achieved without including all 
types of learners in one learning environment.  Notably, its paragraph 2 states that &#8220;regular 
schools with this inclusive orientation are the most effective means of combating discriminatory 
attitudes, creating welcoming communities, building an inclusive society and achieving 
education for all&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>19. The World Education Forum, held in Dakar from 26 to 28 April 2000, reiterated the need 
to focus on access to education and inclusion for learners from disadvantaged or marginalized 
backgrounds.  To meet this goal, the expanded commentary on the Dakar Framework for Action 
stresses that &#8220;education systems must be inclusive, actively seeking out children who are not 
enrolled, and responding flexibly to the circumstances and needs of all learners&#8221; (para. 33). 
</p>
<p>20. In September 2006, the Committee on the Rights of the Child adopted its 
general comment No. 9 on the rights of children with disabilities.  This general comment 
specifically views inclusive education as the goal of educating children with disabilities and 
indicates that States should aim at providing &#8220;schools with appropriate accommodation and 
individual support&#8221; for these persons.<b>15</b>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>21. Most recently, in December 2006, the General Assembly in its resolution 61/106 adopted 
the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (Disability Convention).  This 
Convention unambiguously recognized the link between inclusive education and the right to 
education of persons with disabilities in its article 24 as follows:  &#8220;States Parties recognize the 
right of persons with disabilities to education.  With a view to realizing this right without 
discrimination and on the basis of equal opportunity, States Parties shall ensure an inclusive 
education system at all levels and lifelong learning.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>III. OBLIGATIONS IN RELATION TO THE RIGHT TO  
EDUCATION OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES 
</b></p>
<p><b>The nature of responsibilities of States parties to human rights treaties 
</b></p>
<p>22. Human rights law places three broad obligations on States in relation to the right to 
education.  First, the State must not interfere with the enjoyment of this right.  Secondly, the 
State must protect against discrimination and ensure the equal enjoyment of this right between 
men and women.<b>16</b>  Thirdly, the State must take steps, using the maximum of available 
resources, with a view to achieving the full realization of the right to education.<b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>23. As parties to human rights treaties, it is of course States that have the primary legal 
obligation to respect, protect and fulfil the right to education under those treaties.  However, in 
practice the active, non-discriminatory involvement of a wide range of additional actors is 
essential, if inclusive education is to be realized.  Indeed, inclusion encompasses not only the 
rights of marginalized learners but also, more broadly, the acceleration of cultural and value 
shifts both in the education system and in the wider community generally.  In this respect, three 
specific points are made below.  These are followed by a brief review of minimum requirements 
of State legislative, policy and financial frameworks.  Similarly, the success of inclusive 
education sometimes also depends on empowering local authorities to make decisions on 
accessibility and inclusion and holding these authorities accountable. 
</p>
<p>24. At the central government level, responsibility for the right to education of persons with 
disabilities is often spread among different institutions, such as a ministry for social affairs or a 
ministry of health.  The potential for incoherent policy and legislation and their implementation 
in the context of inclusive education is obvious.  A single government institution, the ministry of 
education, should therefore have the responsibility of ensuring the fulfilment of the right to 
inclusive education for all. 
</p>
<p>25. Responsibility for, and realization of, inclusive education is also of course inevitably 
dependent upon parents, communities and teachers.  The United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund 
(UNICEF) states that all three are keys to supporting all aspects of society, and indeed all three

</p>
<p>have the responsibility to promote and protect the right to inclusive education.  However,  
prevalent misconceptions about disability generally, the belief that children with disabilities must 
either &#8220;adapt&#8221; to mainstream schools and/or that segregated schools are appropriate are currently 
held by all three groups.  It is vital that these misconceptions are broken down, and swiftly.  To 
this end, States should consider programmes to provide information and raise awareness among 
the community generally on the importance of inclusive education.  More specifically, if indeed 
&#8220;teacher attitudes and tolerance are the vehicles for the construction of an inclusive and 
participatory society&#8221;,<b>18</b> as convincingly asserted by UNICEF, focused pre- and in-service 
training for teachers is imperative, as is the establishment of training programmes for school 
administrators, education planners and policy makers. 
</p>
<p><b>Policy, legislative and financial frameworks 
</b></p>
<p>26. Adequate domestic policy, legislative and financial frameworks are a prerequisite for 
States&#8217; meeting their obligations in relation to the right to education generally and inclusive 
education specifically.  States should consequently ensure adequate, focused and effective 
legislative, policy and financial frameworks.  It is important here to emphasize that legislation is 
not an end in itself and the impact of legislative frameworks depends on the level of 
implementation, the sustainability of funding, effective monitoring and evaluation, as well as 
more detailed policy frameworks that ensure that legal norms are translatable into practical terms 
and programmes.  At a minimum and with the above points in mind, these frameworks should:<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(a) Recognize inclusive education as a right 
</b>27. States should recognize inclusive education as an inherent component of the right to 
education.  To give guidance to the meaning of legislation and to entrench it, States should make 
specific reference to any relevant treaty obligations under international human rights law. 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Identify minimum standards in relation to the right to education 
</b>28. States should formally identify standards of education to ensure that persons with 
disabilities can enjoy available, accessible, acceptable and adaptable education on an equal basis 
with others.  These standards should cover at the minimum:  physical access, communication 
access (sign language and Braille), social access (to peers), economic access (affordability) of 
schooling; early identification of special education needs and early childhood intervention; the 
promotion of curriculum development that is common to all learners and fosters human rights 
education and learning; the guarantee of mandatory pre-service and in-service training for 
teachers and school administrators; the provision of individualized student support, where 
necessary; the linking of all areas of education reform to ensure consistency throughout with the 
right to education and inclusive education.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>(c) Identify minimum standards in relation to the underlying determinants of the 
right to education 
</b></p>
<p>29. States should both view and ensure the family, community and civil society as active 
participants in inclusive education.  Policy and legislation should seek to ensure such 
participation of the community, including of course those learners with disabilities themselves, 
in decision-making, through capacity-building, combating habitual and discriminatory attitudes 
and misconceptions about persons with disabilities, ensuring the liberty of parents to choose 
educational institutions for their children and raising general awareness about the rights of 
persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p><b>(d) Ensure a transition plan 
</b>30. The specific detail of the introduction and transition to inclusive education is often a 
process that has, and it can be expected will continue, to differ across States.  Whichever form 
such a process might take, legislative and policy frameworks should specifically provide for a 
transition plan to ensure that learners are not left stranded in reform processes. 
</p>
<p><b>(e) Identify duty-bearers and their responsibilities  
</b>31. States must identify the responsibilities of relevant actors and devolve responsibilities - 
central, provincial and local government, ministries of education, school administrators, teachers 
and others, such as community organizations, where relevant. 
</p>
<p><b>(f) Provide resources 
</b>32. States should guarantee adequate minimum and sustainable resource allocations, and seek 
international assistance where resources or knowledge are lacking. 
</p>
<p><b>(g) Establish monitoring and evaluation mechanisms 
</b>33. States should establish effective and transparent monitoring and evaluation procedures, 
including thorough provision for statistical and data collection and analysis.  They should also 
make provision for an effective individual remedy, including judicial remedies and ensure an 
active role for national human rights commissions and disability ombudsmen. 
</p>
<p>34. Priority areas for funding to promote inclusive education include:  pre-service training for 
teachers and school administrators; in-service training for teachers and administrators and 
professional development; the conversion of special schools into resource centres and the use of 
staff in special schools to provide expertise in mainstream schools; the guarantee of adequate 
remuneration for teaching and related staff and the introduction of reasonable accommodations 
(physical, technological, structural) to ensure that the learning environment is accessible for all 
students with disabilities. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>IV. CHALLENGES TO THE REALIZATION OF THE RIGHT  
TO EDUCATION OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES 
</b></p>
<p>35. A principal issue that must be addressed for the achievement of the right to education of 
persons with disabilities is the identification and management of challenges that prevent 
effective inclusion.  Potential challenges have been noted above and include:  existing negative 
attitudes and values towards persons with disabilities; inattention to the specific needs of women 
with disabilities; inadequate skills among teachers and administrators; inaccessibility of 
education, particularly physical access to buildings and access to learning materials; resource 
constraints; and inadequate attention to the special education needs of learners in mainstream 
education.  Many of these challenges can be addressed at the macrolevel, reaffirming the State&#8217;s 
position as primary duty-bearer with regard to human rights. 
</p>
<p>36. Of these, the principal challenge is the deeply embedded social stigmatization of persons 
with disability.  Stereotypical images, often combined with hostility and traditional attitudes 
towards persons with disabilities, currently prevalent among teachers, school authorities, local 
authorities, communities and even families, can reinforce exclusion of learners with disabilities, 
and clearly hinder inclusion.  Indeed, this is recognized in the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities, which formally records that it is not &#8220;disability&#8221; that hinders full and 
effective participation in society, but rather &#8220;attitudinal and environmental barriers&#8221; in that 
society.  Such barriers and stigmatization underscore the imperative of keeping rights clearly 
articulated and entrenched in policy and legislative frameworks.  Consequently, the institution of 
awareness-raising campaigns on inclusive education and, more broadly, on the Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, as well as training programmes for teachers and other 
professionals related to lifelong learning, are essential.<b>20</b> 
</p>
<p>37. Inclusion is too often misconceived as prohibitively expensive, impractical or a strictly 
disability-specific issue.  Research suggests, however, that States that have appropriately 
implemented the inclusive education model have found it can be less costly to implement and 
operate than segregated special education services; have broader educational and social benefits 
for children and contribute significantly to the ongoing professional development and job 
satisfaction of educators.<b>21</b> 
</p>
<p>38. This is not to say that inclusive education, in order to be implemented successfully, is 
without resource implications.  It was estimated in the Education for All 2000 Assessment that 
achieving education for all globally would require an increase in financial support by donors of 
approximately US$ 8 billion a year.<b>22</b>  Given that many countries have limited resources that 
have to be divided among a range of social sectors, it is important that States use the &#8220;maximum

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of available resources&#8221; in such a way that resources are used optimally and focused on meeting 
clear benchmarks.  This implicates the necessity of early identification and implementation of 
appropriate, cost-effective measures.  National action plans for human rights as well as 
rights-based budgeting will contribute to the success of all such measures.  Similarly, it is 
important to ensure the sustainability of education funding.  If education programmes are set to 
ensure greater inclusion and then the budget is cut, the adverse effects on inclusion are obvious. 
</p>
<p>39. A particular challenge in the context of promoting and protecting the general right to 
education is, clearly, the need to ensure that the education system meets the special education 
needs of persons with disabilities.  An early response was, as noted above, to provide segregated 
schools.  While positive in some respects (for instance, facilitating social contact with some peer 
groups, and specific academic achievements), segregated education has tended to perpetuate the 
marginalization and stereotyping of persons with disabilities and to reduce their capacity to 
participate effectively in community life.  It is now widely recognized that inclusion of learners 
with disabilities in mainstream schools confers significant psychological advantages, as well as 
greater fulfilment of intellectual and, especially, social and emotional needs through regular and 
natural interaction with a diverse group of learners.  The current challenge is how best to provide 
appropriate opportunities for these learners within mainstream schools.  Continued research to 
this effect is necessary. 
</p>
<p>40. However, the relationship between special education and inclusive education remains 
extraordinarily complex.  For example, it is necessary for deaf learners to learn sign language 
and blind learners to study Braille at the beginning of their education.<b>23</b>  Such learning may take 
place, even in a school committed to inclusion, by way of separation of, for instance, a deaf 
learner from those that hear.  Here, therefore, the goal of inclusion might be thwarted.  Another 
challenge, briefly touched on above, arises when &#8220;integration&#8221; is confused with &#8220;inclusion&#8221;:  
where learners with disabilities are merely placed in mainstream schools without the additional 
support required to accommodate their individual needs.  The &#8220;integration&#8221; of learners with 
disabilities without full inclusion can lead to isolation of the learner and ultimately, an obstacle 
to meeting the education needs of all learners. 
</p>
<p>41. A combination of the above leads the Special Rapporteur to underline the fact that the 
inclusive education paradigm should not be seen as a &#8220;one-system-fits-all&#8221; solution.  Embracing 
principles of participation and non-discrimination, innovative, individually focused and flexible 
implementation, which addresses all disabilities and cultural variability, is crucial.  First and 
foremost however, inclusive education - when considering education of child learners - must 
take into account &#8220;the best interests of the child&#8221;.  In so doing, the focus must move away from 
disability - an approach typical of the medical model - towards the individual education needs of 
all children, whether they are learners with or without disabilities.  Such considerations must be 
taken fully into account within the overall framework of an inclusive general education system.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>V. MONITORING THE RIGHT TO EDUCATION OF 
PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES 
</b></p>
<p>42. At the international level, the various treaty bodies, such as the Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the future Committee 
on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, together with the Special Rapporteur on the right to 
education and the Special Rapporteur on disability, have a combined role to play in monitoring 
the right to inclusive education of persons with disabilities.  At the national level, this role falls 
to the courts, to national human rights institutions, to ombudsmen, to administrative tribunals 
and to government and independent experts and academics.  Monitoring should be &#8220;across the 
board&#8221; and, while access to quality free and compulsory primary education is a paramount 
consideration, it is important to bear in mind that the right to education applies to the broad and 
entire spectrum of lifelong learning. 
</p>
<p>43. Of particular relevance is the role of courts and quasi-judicial tribunals in providing 
remedies for breaches of the right to education.  Preliminary research has identified relevant 
cases in numerous jurisdictions, including Argentina, Australia, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, 
India, Ireland, Israel and the United States of America.<b>24</b>  It should be noted here however that, 
while judicial notice and enforcement of the right to education of persons with disabilities is 
important, such decisions have not necessarily met the standards required by international human 
rights norms, and now specifically detailed in the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities.  In making this point, the need for legal reform and judicial training is 
underscored.<b>25</b>  Significantly, the Optional Protocol to the Disability Convention acknowledges 
the justiciability of all rights, including the right to education of persons with disabilities.

<p>  See Purvis, ibid:  &#8220;Where the majority narrowly constructed disability so that the behavioural 
manifestations of a child&#8217;s disability were excluded from the definition of &#8216;disability&#8217; - thus the 
school&#8217;s decision to expel the child from school was held not to constitute unlawful 
discrimination.&#8221; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>44. Similarly, national human rights institutions and ombudsmen have a significant role to 
play in monitoring the right to education of persons with disabilities.  Internationally, 
intergovernmental organizations such as the United Nations, UNESCO, UNICEF and the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have already undertaken 
significant work in the area of inclusive education.  These organizations, together with civil 
society initiatives, in particular organizations representing persons with disabilities, have a role 
to play in developing conceptually inclusive education within a human rights framework, in 
monitoring implementation, gathering statistics and data and in compiling best practices. 
</p>
<p>45. Monitoring the right to education and inclusive education in particular, requires a 
capacity to measure progress.  To date, such capacity is lacking.  Establishing clear quantitative 
and qualitative human rights indicators and the setting of benchmarks for future progress will 
therefore provide important means for doing so and may go some way towards filling the current 
gap in adequate, available data on disability generally, and disability and education in particular.  
While a quantitative indicator might provide, for instance, information on the number of children 
with disabilities enrolled in schools, a qualitative indicator will describe the quality of the 
syllabus and the extent to which disability is mainstreamed or sidelined within the curriculum.  
Accordingly, the Special Rapporteur encourages Governments, treaty bodies and United Nations 
agencies to develop indicators to measure the right to education of persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONNAIRE 
</b>46. In order to compile up-to-date information on the situation of the right to education of 
persons with disabilities, the Special Rapporteur sent out a detailed questionnaire to 
Governments, United Nations agencies, NGOs and independent experts. 
</p>
<p>47. By the deadline for submission, responses had been received from the Governments of 
Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Costa Rica, Croatia, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, 
Iraq, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Japan, Mauritius, Mexico, Morocco, Panama, the Philippines, 
Poland, Portugal, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Spain, Turkey and Uganda.  
Responses were also received from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and UNESCO, and from 
local government authorities, universities, national human rights institutions, experts and NGOs 
from Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, 
El Salvador, the European Union, Germany, Ghana, Honduras, India, Israel, Italy, Kenya, 
Malawi, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Peru, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Spain, 
Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Uganda, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland, the United States of America and Viet Nam.  The Special Rapporteur also received 
regional responses from the African, Central Asian and Asia-Pacific regions, and from specific 
regions of some countries.  The information provided below includes some comments made by 
the Special Rapporteur in order to place the responses received in the appropriate context.<b>26</b> 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Stubrin, Carlos Skliar and Lucila Rosso. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Legal and conceptual aspects 
</b></p>
<p>48. First of all, the Special Rapporteur wishes to point out that many of the countries 
consulted have national frameworks for the protection of human rights, even if those frameworks 
do not always take account of persons with disabilities.  However, formal legal recognition does 
not always lead to effective practices that guarantee decent and quality education for persons 
with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>49. For those reasons, there is a need for a wide-ranging debate on the meanings and 
implications of the concepts of &#8220;inclusion&#8221; and &#8220;education for all&#8221; in order to ensure that 
changes in education systems are not merely reclassifications of groups and individuals who are 
considered to be &#8220;different&#8221;, but rather introduce new methods of pedagogical interaction 
between all members of the education community. 
</p>
<p>50. It should be pointed out that inclusion is not merely the opposite of exclusion.  This is 
why the Special Rapporteur believes that inclusive education involves a radical political and 
cultural change in education systems.  In other words, the system that excludes cannot be the 
same system that includes or promises to include, since that would imply a mechanism that 
merely substituted inclusion for exclusion in order to maintain control over excluded groups.  
One has only to think of the many forms of exclusionary inclusion, such as so-called &#8220;integrated 
education&#8221;, which give rise to separation based on the subjective effects of &#8220;being included&#8221;. 
</p><p>51. In many of the countries surveyed, the role of regulatory legal frameworks and that of the 
programmes and public policies pursued by some Governments appear to be inadequate.  The 
shortage of available financing and resources and the lack of political will on the part of local 
government authorities in countries with decentralized administrations appear to be the main 
factors responsible for the partial or inadequate implementation of policies and provisions aimed 
at guaranteeing the right to education of children and young people with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>52.  On the basis of the responses received, the Special Rapporteur notes that the vast 
majority of the countries surveyed have mixed arrangements in which special education schools 
are combined with the inclusion or integration of students with disabilities in mainstream 
schools.  In most cases, there appears to be a tendency to give priority to educating persons with 
disabilities in mainstream schools.  However, such practices are very ineffectively implemented 
and their results usually do not meet the aspirations and goals that motivate them. 
</p>
<p>53. There is almost universal recognition of the need to promote inclusive education 
practices.  However, the concept of inclusive education does not seem to be clearly recognized in 
all countries, many of which identify it with integrated education.  There does not appear to be a 
consensus on the meanings and implications of the two pedagogical approaches or methods. 
</p>
<p>54. Some continental trends may be established on the basis of these assessments.  In African 
and Asian countries, the term &#8220;inclusive education&#8221; is used to refer to the process of 
incorporating children and young people with disabilities into the regular education system 
without any reference to integrated education.  However, there does not appear to be any 
distinction between these two pedagogical concepts and trends.  In Latin America, both are 
mentioned as prerequisites for the egalitarian implementation of the right to education of persons 
with disabilities, but again, no clear differentiation is made between them. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Institutional aspects 
</b></p>
<p>55. Although many of the respondents advocate the promotion of models of inclusive 
education, most also believe that it is necessary to maintain special education systems for 
children with severe disabilities or for those who simply prefer special attention.  Many countries 
opt for combined systems of regular and special education that include a variety of modalities:  
regular education with special classes; special education only for those with a specific disability 
(usually motor or multiple); and preschool or temporary special education, such as institutions 
that prepare children with disabilities for educational inclusion. 
</p>
<p>56. The theories of inclusion and integration appear to contradict one another, with a marked 
tendency towards the persistence of modalities of segregated education.  The recognition of these 
modalities as a prerequisite for guaranteeing the effective exercise of the right to education of 
persons with disabilities is accompanied by calls for a number of radical changes in education 
systems. 
</p>
<p>57. In the past, the special education system tended to treat individuals uniformly where no 
uniformity existed, and to differentiate among individuals where no differentiation was 
necessary.  This arrangement has remained more or less unchanged in the shift towards inclusive 
education.  Even today, a population segment may be considered to have &#8220;special educational 
needs based on disability&#8221;, without taking into account the fact that the effects of inclusion, even 
when access to inclusion is widely available, are subject to change and vary enormously in terms 
of their duration and content. 
</p>
<p>58. Mention should be made of the situation of deaf people in such countries as Sweden or 
the United Kingdom where, according to the NGOs surveyed, access to bilingualism is 
considered to be a prerequisite for egalitarian education; or the situation of blind people in 
Switzerland, where initial support results in subsequent equal education opportunities.  In both 
cases, the principles of compensation and differentiation applied cannot be considered 
discriminatory since they recognize principles and rights, such as access to the country&#8217;s sign 
language and to literacy training in certain conditions.  In short, the inclusion approach does not 
mean overlooking the particular features of the groups comprising the &#8220;disabled&#8221; population.  It 
does, however, mean that those particular features should not be viewed as negative or deficient 
according to criteria and discourse derived exclusively from the medical model. 
</p>
<p>59. Systems for, and experience in, evaluating the quality and relevance of the education of 
persons with disabilities (both in regular and in special education) are practically non-existent.  
The European countries are the only countries that implement strategies and policies for 
evaluating these practices.  It is more common to find evaluations of the performance of learners 
with disabilities, but such evaluations are still in the early stages. 
</p>
<p>60. In many of the countries considered in this report, public debt and inadequate investment 
are factors that limit the attainment and expansion of the right to education of persons with 
disabilities.  The lack of resources for education as a result of financial dependence and the 
privatization and commercialization of education are obstacles to the expansion of this right. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>61. Few countries accept the general practice of charging fees in public education systems.  
However, many of the responses to the questionnaire recognize the existence of indirect 
fee-charging practices in public education, such as for the purchase of school supplies or 
payment of registration or exam fees.  In the case of children and young people with disabilities, 
additional costs are higher owing primarily to the quantity of specialized materials and 
equipment required to &#8220;guarantee&#8221; adequate learning conditions.  As the Special Rapporteur and 
his predecessor have repeatedly indicated, in cases in which it is recognized that direct or 
indirect fees for public education are charged to students with disabilities, the fees and charges 
for other related items have a negative impact on the ability of such persons to enter and remain 
in the education system. 
</p>
<p>62. Another interesting fact concerns the number of specialized schools in each country:  this 
number varies depending on vital rates, the amount of financial resources allocated to education 
and the degree of development of inclusive education policies, among other factors.  In many 
countries, there are a number of educational alternatives for children and young persons with 
disabilities, which are organized outside the formal education system.  NGOs, informal 
education centres, rehabilitation centres subordinate to health ministries and departments, 
religious groups and community organizations offer a variety of activities ranging from home 
schooling to leisure and recreational facilities. 
</p>
<p><b>The question of difference 
</b></p>
<p>63. It is clear that inclusive education should be part of a process and transformation initiated 
and carried out by the regular education system to a much greater extent than by the special 
education system. 
</p>
<p>64. From this perspective, what the responses seem largely to convey is the fact that inclusive 
education is in danger of being transformed into a new and improved policy of differentiation; in 
other words, into a process that, once again, singles out persons considered to be different from 
the rest; this contradicts the very spirit of the shift in education towards inclusion.  If, it is a 
matter of refocusing the rules, and deciding who is and who is not covered by them, inclusion 
may end up being understood as a simple process of establishing rules that apply to certain 
groups or to certain specific environments. 
</p>
<p><b>Non-governmental organizations 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur notes that the specific strategies and practices of inclusion are in 
many cases promoted by NGOs.<b>27</b>  Some countries clearly assign responsibility for inclusion to 
these organizations, thereby relinquishing their obligations.  This creates, without a doubt, a 
complicated situation:  since the State does not assume the function of inclusion - not only 
academic but, more generally, social economic and cultural inclusion - many middle- or 
upper-class families resolve the issue of the inclusion of their children with disabilities by

</p>
<p>directly hiring private teachers to provide instruction, without involving the educational 
community.  It is, furthermore, clear that the absence of institutional change leads to the 
creation of groups of parents who prefer a system of special education for their children. 
</p>
<p><b>Statistical information 
</b></p>
<p>66. Among the responses received by the Special Rapporteur, there is a conspicuous lack of 
statistical data on the number of persons with disabilities, and even less information on the 
number of persons with disabilities enrolled in school.  Moreover, the variety of methods of 
counting and statistical measurement makes it extremely difficult to compare data.  
Comparability of data is particularly important for understanding the seriousness of the problem 
of educating persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>67. There is also very little statistical information on school abandonment or dropout rates for 
children and young people with disabilities, and there are practically no statistics that compare 
these rates with those for students without disabilities.  Nevertheless, preliminary data indicate 
that the dropout rate for children with disabilities is comparatively higher than for children 
without disabilities.  This phenomenon is attributed to the stigmatization to which children with 
disabilities are subjected, poor teacher training, limited resources and the inadequacy of 
educational infrastructures. 
</p>
<p>68. Similarly, there is little information on the academic success or failure (absolute and 
comparative) of children and young people with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>69. It would be particularly interesting to know the institutional movements of the disabled 
population over a relatively significant period of time.  In some countries this population has 
been transferred, in whole or in part, from special education to regular education systems, and it 
is probable that the enrolment rate was initially high.  However, it is important to know what 
happened and what happens when this population drops out of a system that has not been able 
and/or has not known how to include it.  If, as has occurred in some countries or in some regions 
of some countries, special education institutions have totally or partially disappeared, where has 
the disabled population gone? 
</p>
<p><b>Support services and teacher training 
</b></p>
<p>70. The inclusion measures listed in the responses to the questionnaire sent out by the Special 
Rapporteur refer mainly to institutions providing support and assistance to teaching staff as part 
of the process of integrating persons with disabilities into mainstream schools.  However, the 
vast majority of responses point out the precariousness and inadequacy of these programmes, 
provisions and policies.  In Western European countries, inclusion programmes are more 
systematic and structured, while in Latin America and Africa they are limited to isolated 
strategies that are rarely implemented. 
</p>
<p>71. Most of the countries and organizations surveyed refer to the need to invest in the 
training of regular teachers for children with special needs, through educational institutions that 
provide both initial training and specialization courses and in-service training. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur also notes that, in many cases, mechanisms aimed at ensuring 
equal access to education of children and young people with disabilities, as well as many 
inclusion measures promoted at the national or local level by government authorities, are usually 
restricted to infrastructure projects designed to facilitate the physical access and mobility of 
persons with motor, visual or hearing disabilities in schools.  Nevertheless, it should be 
recognized that accessibility is a condition and not the final aim of inclusion, and that education 
based on the best interests of children and on their relations with others must always be the 
central pedagogical approach.  The responses to the questionnaire reflect this overemphasis on 
physical accessibility, even though there does not appear to be the same concern, in a large 
number of the cases analysed, for the inclusion of students with disabilities in all other aspects of 
school activity, including essential areas of learning. 
</p>
<p>73. Public transport for persons with disabilities is free of charge in many of the countries 
surveyed.  However, very few countries provide school transport services that are free of charge 
and adapted to the needs of such persons. 
</p>
<p><b>Regional differences 
</b></p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur notes a marked disparity between rich countries and poor 
countries with regard to the conditions in which persons with disabilities are educated in schools.  
In European countries, there is a strong trend towards inclusive education, and there are many 
programmes that provide support and financial assistance to families; special materials are paid 
for by the State.  In Latin America and in many regions of Asia and Africa, programmes aimed 
at ensuring effective conditions for the education of persons with disabilities have very limited 
resources and provide negligible financial assistance to families. 
</p>
<p>75. The inadequacy or non-existence of health centres in peripheral and rural areas greatly 
complicates life for persons with disabilities.  In some countries, particularly in Latin America 
and Africa, poverty and rurality usually go hand in hand, exacerbating the prejudices to which 
these persons are subjected. 
<b>Multiple discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>76. Numerous factors combine with disability to exacerbate the discriminatory and 
exclusionary effects noted in many education systems.  Belonging to certain identity and social 
groups (such as nomadic tribes, persons of African descent, Dalits, Roma or indigenous peoples), 
social conditions and gender (girls and women with disabilities are subjected to more 
discrimination than boys or men with the same conditions) are factors that make life even more 
difficult. 
</p>
<p>77. There are extremely few educational policies and special facilities for children and young 
people with multiple disabilities. 
</p>
<p>78. Opinions are divided as to whether or not education contributes to the empowerment of 
learners with disabilities.  Those who claim that education processes make an effective 
contribution to empowering persons with disabilities and improving their living conditions cite 
the learning of daily life skills and integration into the labour market.  Those who claim that this 
contribution is preliminary or limited argue that the attainment of practical skills and academic </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>knowledge does not improve the performance of such persons in other spheres of social life.  It 
should be noted that the term &#8220;empowerment&#8221; is not used uniformly, and has different meanings 
and characteristics in each of the responses. 
</p>
<p><b>Participation 
</b></p>
<p>79. In most countries, neither persons with disabilities nor their relatives or representatives 
take part in designing specific education programmes and curriculum guidelines, or else, their 
participation is essentially reduced to orientation courses or to collective learning or recreational 
activities.  There are virtually no specific measures aimed at ensuring this type of intervention.  
In African countries, however, the need to involve the community in decisions on education is 
starting to gain importance.  In some regions of Latin America, parents are made aware of the 
importance of their cooperation in developing pedagogical proposals in regular schools, and 
some European countries are carrying out programmes and policies that call for the active 
participation of parents in decision-making concerning the education of their children, as is the 
case in Finland.  In that country, parents&#8217; participation in special education is obligatory, and 
they freely choose where to educate their children, without any additional cost.  Moreover, in its 
report A6-0351/2006 of 13 October 2006 on the situation of people with disabilities in the 
enlarged European Union, the European Parliament stresses the need to encourage initiatives to 
develop greater interaction between the public and the mentally disabled, and to de-stigmatize 
people with mental health problems, and appeals for the necessary support for the families of 
people with a profound disability. 
</p>
<p>80. The right of parents of persons with disabilities to choose the most appropriate education 
for their children appears to be recognized in some countries, in legislative frameworks that 
regulate education systems.  However, the effective exercise of this right is conditioned by a set 
of factors that often make its full enjoyment impossible. 
</p>
<p><b>VII.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> The existing human rights legal and programmatic frameworks clearly recognize 
inclusive education as an indispensable element of the right to education for persons with 
disability.  Inclusive education, in short, seeks to avoid the exclusion of all learners, 
including learners with disabilities, from education.  By definition, the exclusion of learners 
from education - particularly primary and secondary - indicates a breach of the right to 
education.  </b> 
</p>
<p>82. <b>At the same time, implementing inclusive education also raises challenges in 
practice.  The provision of adequate and sustainable resources, ensuring an accessible and 
accommodating learning environment, changing traditional or discriminatory attitudes 
towards persons with disabilities, helping teachers, school administrators, families and 
communities understand and participate in decisions and processes related to inclusive 
education and, most significantly, ensuring that the special education needs of learners 
with disabilities are met within the general education system are all important challenges to 
inclusive education.  When these challenges are put in the context of the existing strains on 
schools and communities, they should not be underestimated. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>83. <b>Nonetheless, while such challenges exist, the alternative of excluding large sections 
of the community from enjoying their right to education and the related consequences - 
inequality, exclusion of persons with disabilities from participating in society including 
through employment, the entrenchment of barriers and discriminatory attitudes and 
practices, the maintenance of costly segregation in education and so on - provides the 
impetus to seek solutions to such challenges.  Importantly, much can be done to work 
towards inclusive education either at little additional costs or through the more efficient 
and effective use of existing resources. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that States take the following steps towards 
ensuring an effective inclusive education system: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Eliminate legislative or constitutional barriers to children and adults alike 
with disabilities, being included in the regular education system.  In this regard States 
should: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Ensure a constitutional guarantee of free and compulsory basic education to 
all children; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Adopt and entrench legislation aimed at ensuring the rights of persons with 
disabilities; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Ensure that legislation prohibiting discrimination in employment is adopted 
and enforced.  This will enable persons with disabilities to become teachers; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Ensure that one ministry is responsible for the education of both children 
and adults.  States may therefore need to: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Amend legislation so that the Ministry of Education is responsible for the 
provision of all education; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Ensure that one school system is responsible for the education of all children 
in their region.  To this end, States may need to: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Amalgamate budgets and administration of special education and regular 
education within a geographical area; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Adopt policy priorities and legislation that promotes inclusion of all students 
in the mainstream education system; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Transform existing special education resources - special schools or classes - 
into resources to assist the mainstream system.  To do this States may need to: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Train special educators to serve as additional resources to regular teachers; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Transfer students from special programmes to regular classes supported by 
the resource staff; </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Allocate financial resources for the adequate accommodation of all students 
and for technical assistance to support ministry of education officials, at the 
district, school and classroom level; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Revise testing methods to ensure that accommodation is made for students 
with disabilities; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Provide pre-service and in-service training to teachers so that they can 
respond to diversity in the classroom.  To this end, States may therefore need to: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Train teachers in classroom techniques such as differentiated instruction and 
cooperative learning; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Encourage persons with disabilities to train as teachers; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Use pyramid training techniques where teachers, once trained in inclusive 
education methodologies, teach other teachers and so on; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Provide training to educational administrators and support staff on best 
practice in response to individual student needs.  States may need to: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Provide models of practice that provide support such as &#8220;school-based 
support teams&#8221;; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Provide regular access to new knowledge on school and classroom &#8220;best 
practices&#8221;; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Ensure that conditions that constrain teachers to teach inclusively are 
addressed.  To do this, States may need to: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Address class size.  Smaller class sizes are generally considered to be most 
effective; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Revise and adapt curriculum content in accordance with best practice; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Ensure that school buildings and materials are accessible to children with 
disabilities; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Contribute to, cooperate with and disseminate ongoing international and 
domestic research into best practice as it relates to inclusive education; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Invest in inclusive early childhood care and education (ECCE) programmes, 
which can lay the foundation for lifelong inclusion of children with disabilities in both 
education and society.  States may need to: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Undertake a consultative process, including disabled people&#8217;s organizations 
and groups for parents of disabled children, to develop a national ECCE 
policy; </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Include ECCE in key government resource documents such as national 
budgets, sector plans and poverty reduction strategy papers; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Provide training to parents of children with disabilities so that they know 
about their rights and what to do about it.  Here States may need to: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Support civil organizations, including those of parents of children with 
disabilities, to build capacity on the right to education and how to influence 
effective policy and practice; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Develop accountability mechanisms in order to monitor exclusion, school 
registration and completion of education by persons with disabilities.  States should 
therefore, as a minimum: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Adopt and revise reporting mechanisms to disaggregate data on school 
participation.  Such data should specifically include type of disability; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Seek, and act upon, assistance as required.  To this end, States may need to: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Seek assistance on best practice from States and international and/or 
intergovernmental organizations; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Integrate these best practices into legislative and policy frameworks;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Where adequate resources are lacking, seek international assistance. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Special Rapporteur also recommends: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>To the World Bank:  compilation of best practice where the special education 
needs of persons with disabilities have been met through general education.  
Research into rights-based funding formulas to ensure effective, efficient and 
sustainable resource allocations for the right to education of persons with 
disabilities; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>To the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights:  
to continue assisting human rights mechanisms to review and research 
specific challenges to the rights of persons with disabilities, as the right to 
education will not be realized if their other rights are neglected; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>To national human rights institutions and civil society:  to participate 
actively in the design of inclusive education and to help monitor 
implementation and raise awareness; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>To the Human Rights Council:  to request information on challenges faced 
by States in their prompt ratification of the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities and to request all human rights mechanisms to 
include in their work attention to the situation of persons with disabilities.
