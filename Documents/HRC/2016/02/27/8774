<p><b>Report of the independent expert on the situation of human rights 
in Somalia, Shamsul Bari</b>*<b>

*  The report was submitted after the deadline in order to include the most recent developments. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> There was a general expectation that the human rights situation in Somalia would improve 
with the relocation of the new Transitional Federal Government to Mogadishu in early 2009. 
However, President Sheikh Sharif&#8217;s Government was heavily challenged by hard-line Islamist 
opposition groups, principally Al-Shabaab and Hizbul Islam, beginning with a significant 
offensive for control of Mogadishu on 7 May 2009. Repeated, inaccurate and indiscriminate 
exchanges of mortar fire between all parties have resulted in numerous civilians being killed and 
many injured, with bombs landing on civilian homes, marketplaces and mosques, as well as 
causing tens of thousands to flee the capital and other areas of the conflict. The extreme 
interpretations of sharia law by armed opposition groups, mainly Al-Shabaab and Hizbul Islam 
and local clan militias in control of Kismayo, has led to severe corporal punishment &#8211; for 
example, amputations and stoning &#8211; that illustrates the extent to which violence is still 
substituted for the rule of law in many areas. Grave violations committed against women and 
children have been reported throughout the country, including the recruitment and use of 
children by all parties to the conflict. Reports of killing, maiming and sexual and gender-based 
violence in the context of the conflict are also rife.<b> 
</b></p>
<p> Troops of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) which guards Mogadishu and 
key Government installations have frequently been targeted by the Islamists, the worst such 
incident occurring in September 2009 when the Deputy Force Commander and at least 17 
peacekeepers were killed in coordinated suicide attacks on AMISOM troops. As the latter 
retaliated against the attacks, many of which were launched from civilian populated areas such as 
Baakara Market, there were reports of civilian casualties resulting therefrom and from the 
opposition forces&#8217; counter-attacks. There was also significant displacement of population from 
the capital. Journalists and human rights defenders in all parts of Somalia, including in Puntland 
and Somaliland, continue to face increasing risks, severe threats and targeted killings for their 
work. The most devastating of these attacks was the suicide bombing on 3 December 2009 of the 
graduation ceremony of medical students in which Government ministers, doctors, journalists, 
medical students and teachers were killed. 
</p>
<p> The independent expert welcomes the Government&#8217;s recent decision to ratify the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, but reiterates his concern about the continuing violations 
of human rights and humanitarian law in Somalia. He believes that the key tasks of the 
Government include the establishment of the rule of law and good governance in Somalia. This 
will help generate popular support for its efforts to ensure peace and reconciliation. He urges all 
parties to the conflict to come together for the sake of peace in Somalia, where the people have 
suffered one of the worst nightmares in history from which they deserve to be released. He 
stresses the negative impact of piracy, mixed migrations and related human trafficking in 
Somalia, which could undermine the fragile stability of Puntland and Somaliland. He therefore 
urges the international community to deal with the ground realities of these phenomena with a 
holistic approach; highlights the urgent need to establish an appropriate mechanism to combat 
impunity and hold the perpetrators of the potential war crimes and massive human rights and 
humanitarian law violations accountable; recommends that the United Nations moves the hub of 
its activities from Nairobi to the safer areas in Somalia; and urges the international community to 
provide the necessary funds to the Government and to the United Nations to enable them to fulfil 
their various responsibilities.<b> </b></p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 12/26 of 
September 2009, in which the Human Rights Council expressed its deep concern at the human 
rights and humanitarian situation in Somalia and renewed the mandate of the independent expert 
for one year, requesting him to submit a report thereon to the thirteen session of the Human 
Rights Council in March 2010. To this end, the independent expert undertook his fourth field 
visit to Kenya and Somalia from 12 to 24 January 2010. He visited Hargeisa in Somaliland and 
Bossasso and Garowe in Puntland. In Kenya, he held meetings in Nairobi and visited the Dadaab 
refugee camps. He was, unfortunately, unable to visit Mogadishu and the south-central regions 
of Somalia. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>2. It may be recalled that the independent expert had presented his third report to the Council 
in September 2009. The present report covers the period from September 2009 to February 2010. 
It is based on the independent expert&#8217;s meetings with Somali stakeholders, members of the 
Transitional Federal Government and Parliament, civil society organizations, refugees and the 
United Nations. 
</p>
<p>3. The independent expert is grateful to all interlocutors, as well as to the United Nations 
Political Office for Somalia (UNPOS), OHCHR, the United Nations Department of Safety and 
Security, UNHCR, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United 
Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) staff for their hospitality and logistical support during his 
stay in Nairobi and his trips to Hargeisa, Bossaso and Garowe.  
</p>
<p><b>II.  MEETINGS AND INFORMATION-GATHERING  
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Meetings with the Transitional Federal Government 
</b></p>
<p>4. The visit of the President of Somalia to Nairobi during the independent expert&#8217;s stay in the 
city gave the expert the opportunity to meet the President for the first time since the latter 
assumed office. The independent expert also had separate meetings with the Minister for Gender, 
Women and Family Affairs, Fauzia Mohamed Sheikh, who is also the Focal Point for Human 
Rights, and the Minister for Finance and Deputy Prime Minster, Sharif Hassan Sheikh Aden. He 
expresses his gratitude to them for agreeing to see him despite their tight schedule. 
</p>
<p>5. The independent expert conveyed to the President his concerns about the continuing 
human rights and humanitarian law violations in Somalia and underlined the importance of the 
role of the Government in protecting the people. Despite the Government&#8217;s limited resources and 
capacity, there is a need for it to demonstrate that it is nevertheless determined, committed and 
able to lead the country out of the conflict and bring peace, reconciliation and recovery. 
</p>
<p>6. The President shared the expert&#8217;s concerns but underlined the many challenges his 
Government faced. He said that human rights would continue to be violated for as long as war 
prevailed in Somalia and peace and stability had not returned. The primary need for his country, 
therefore, was to improve the security situation; this in turn would ensure protection of the 
population and improve their human rights. There was also a need to build the capacity of the </p>

 <p> 
Government to discharge its various responsibilities. The Government needed more troops to end 
the insurgency, as well as the support of the international community both financially and in 
terms of technical support.  
</p>
<p>7. The Minister for Gender, Women and Family Affairs and the Minister for Finance echoed 
the views of the President. They emphasized that the Government was awaiting fulfilment of the 
pledges made by the international community at the International Conference on Somalia held in 
Brussels in April 2009 to fund Government activities.  
</p>
<p>8. The Government hopes that the tide would turn soon in the fight against anti-Government 
elements, particularly Al-Shabaab. It is in the process of adding more troops to its security forces 
and training them properly; some troops have already been trained in neighbouring countries. 
The Government&#8217;s efforts are hampered by a lack of resources, however, and sometimes the 
troops cannot even be paid their salaries or provided with sufficient food allowance. 
Nevertheless, the Government hopes to take on the enemy in the near future.  
</p>
<p>9. The Government has plans for improving the education and health system in the country; 
for example, the Government hopes to open more educational institutions, including in camps for 
internally displaced persons (IDPs). Such institutions would help prevent children in the camps 
joining Al-Shabaab. Given many people&#8217;s financial difficulties and the need to survive in a war-
torn country, children&#8217;s primary reason for joining Al-Shabaab is to feed themselves and help 
their families. Al-Shabaab is taking advantage of this situation and recruiting children from 
poorer families by offering them money. The Government also wants to create jobs in IDP 
camps so families can support their children rather than send them to join opposition forces. It is 
also seeking to return IDPs. 
</p>
<p>10. The Government believes that Al-Shabaab is fast losing the people&#8217;s trust, especially since 
the suicide bombing at Shamo Hotel in December 2009, during which innocent people and 
children were killed. People saw how Al-Shabaab was destroying mosques, attacking symbols of 
indigenous Sufi culture and killing people in the name of jihad. Al-Shabaab is planting fear into 
the minds of the people in areas under their control and receiving support from Al-Qaida and 
other unpopular foreign criminal elements. The Government is thinking of creating human rights 
courts that would help people follow up their cases against the perpetrators of human rights 
violations. The Government&#8217;s removal of the heads of the security forces and police 
demonstrated the determination of Government to clean up the administration. The ratification of 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child is under way. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Meetings with United Nations officials and others 
</b></p>
<p>11. There is a general consensus among United Nations officials that the survival of the 
Transitional Federal Government for one year in a very challenging security situation is in itself 
a significant achievement. The Government has undertaken a number of initiatives which 
showed that it has started to take up the functions of State seriously. The initiatives include: 
relocation of the new Government to Mogadishu; formulation of an annual budget for Somalia 
for the first time in years; collection of revenue internally; the launching of a radio station, etc. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>12. Additionally, the Government has sought dialogue and reconciliation with the armed 
opposition groups. Partial success has been achieved in this regard, but not enough to transform 
the political arena. This approach and the concomitant resilience of the Government in 
withstanding and repulsing the military offensives of the armed opposition can be said to have 
broken the back of the ideological thrust of the religious extremists that seek to overthrow the 
Government. The Government&#8217;s policy in terms of reconciliation and reaching out to people and 
opposition forces, as well as the development of security-sector institutions and a coordination 
mechanism with the international community, was contained in a set of documents prepared by 
the Government and presented to the meeting of the International Contact Group on Somalia in 
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in December 2009. The preparation of such documents shows the 
Government&#8217;s maturity. 
</p>
<p>13. The Government is engaged in speeding up the accommodation and integration process 
with Ahlu Sunnah, as well as bringing the reconciliation process to local level and engaging 
different sections of the community, including the diaspora, by reporting on and explaining the 
Government&#8217;s programmes and priorities. The Government has also made known its readiness to 
approach and negotiate with all willing armed opposition groups. All this work requires time to 
produce result. The international community must therefore continue its support to the 
Government and, more importantly, provide the financial and other assistance the Government 
needs to succeed in this regard. 
</p>
<p>14. The lack of necessary support from the international community to the Government is a 
matter of serious concern and threatens its survival. The infighting between various groups 
within the Transitional Federal Government is another matter of concern. The declaration of 
support by Al-Shabaab to the insurrection of Al-Huti Shiaist rebels in Yemen should be taken 
seriously by the international community. Regionalization and internationalization of the Somali 
conflict could rapidly affect all countries in the Horn of Africa.  
</p>
<p>15. It will not be possible to restore peace and security in Somalia by watching passively the 
deteriorating security, humanitarian and human rights situation. A policy of simply containing 
attacks against Mogadishu will not last long. The capacity of the Government to protect civilians 
&#8211; including women, children, IDPs and minorities &#8211; against the wave of violence and harsh 
imposition of sharia law by the Islamist forces (leading to cruel, inhuman and degrading 
treatment on a daily basis) must be helped to develop rapidly. 
</p>
<p>16. A new development in the fight between the forces of the Transitional Federal Government 
and Al-Shabaab is the latter&#8217;s professionalization and internationalization as a result of influx of 
foreign jihadists coming from Afghanistan, Pakistan and the Gulf countries. The outsiders are 
reportedly taking over from Somali nationalist jihadists. The bomb attack at the Shamo Hotel in 
Mogadishu during the graduation ceremony of medical students is said to have provoked a split 
within the movement. The attack was reportedly launched by foreign fighters against the will of 
Somali nationalists.  
</p>
<p>17. There are credible reports that the training camps of the jihadists are well-organized and 
young boys are being recruited from Madrasas and Koranic schools to be trained and enrolled as 
fighters. An appalling new dimension of the conflict is the involvement of young boys from the 
Somali diaspora, mainly from Minneapolis in the United States of America and the Nordic 
countries. It is troubling that the perpetrators of the two recent attacks were from the diaspora </p>

 <p> 
and those behind these attacks did not hesitate to claim responsibility for their actions. This new 
strategy of Al-Shabaab is probably to replace local clan-affiliated leaders with foreign jihadists, 
which might deepen the split within the extremist Islamist movement. 
</p>
<p>18. Al-Shabaab is more focused on the training needs of its troops than the Transitional 
Federal Government. Its training camps for Somali youths are better organized. Government 
troops are not paid regularly and some of them even sleep under trees. There is a need for more 
troops simply to defend Mogadishu properly. To achieve even this, the proposed short-term goal 
of the Government to have 10,000 troops ready soon will be insufficient unless there is support 
from the major clans.  
</p>
<p>19. There is a need for more coordination among and within the United Nations agencies. 
Some feel that the commitment of the United Nations to the people of Somalia would be better 
demonstrated if its offices serving Somalia from Nairobi were to move to Somalia itself. A 
positive development in this regard is the recent assessment by the Department of Safety and 
Security of possible relocation of the United Nations to Mogadishu and identification of an area 
in the Somali capital where a secure United Nations compound could be built close to AMISOM. 
The United Nations agencies should move away from the so-called &#8220;Nairobi syndrome&#8221;, which 
means that United Nations operations for Somalia based in Nairobi are actually working <i>on</i> 
Somalia rather than <i>in</i> Somalia.  
</p>
<p>20. On the humanitarian and human rights front, the situation of women and children had 
become more precarious as they bear the brunt of the Somali conflict. Somalia has one of the 
highest maternal mortality rates (14&#8211;17 per cent) due to the disintegration of public medical 
institutions. Women&#8217;s literacy is around 12&#8211;14 per cent, while 80 per cent of young girls married 
early. Although the Somali Constitution of 1991 criminalized female genital mutilations, 97 per 
cent of young girls still face such mutilations.  
</p>
<p>21. There are no credible statistics on violence against women. Cases of gender-based violence 
recorded by women&#8217;s organizations, support programmes and others show that reports of rape 
are increasing in some areas, though this could be due in part to a greater willingness to report. 
As Somali women are more dynamic in the marketplace since they have to earn a living and 
support their family, they are exposed to vulnerable situations. Women are often victims of rape 
by warlords.  
</p>
<p>22. Any peace agreement in Somalia should give greater voice to women. No amnesty should 
be allowed for violence against women that qualifies as crimes against humanity, in line with 
Security Council resolutions 1325 and 1820. Women are often the victims in clan infighting. The 
time has come for women to be at the centre of the peace process. The Government should 
announce a clear policy for the protection of women and children. 
</p>
<p>23. The main concern regarding children is their recruitment by all parties to the conflict. 
There are, however, some positive developments. Despite insecurity in the south-central region, 
child health days organized by UNICEF reached, for the first time ever, children and women in 
the infamous Afgoye Corridor, considered to be world&#8217;s most densely populated IDP settlement, 
and six districts of Mogadishu. Some one million Somali children were vaccinated in 2009, 
which would not have been possible without the cooperation of all, including the opposition 
forces.  </p>

 <p> 
24. By mid-2009, over 11,000 children were enrolled in community schools in Mogadishu 
and 33,000 in Afgoye, the two most war-affected regions in Somalia.<b> </b>This was a 100 per cent 
increase in enrolment since the end of 2008 and was possible largely because most of the actors 
involved had cooperated. There is also significant community support for UNICEF activities, 
even in war-affected areas. Such experience shows that community-based approaches have a 
better chance of success in Somalia. There is a need, therefore, to involve the people and civil 
society in finding solutions to the country&#8217;s long-standing problems. 
</p>
<p>25. Developments in relation to food security, particularly in the context of drought in some 
areas of the south-central region, are matters of serious concern. The situation is compounded by 
restrictions imposed by Al-Shabaab on the World Food Programme (WFP), resulting in the 
suspension of its humanitarian assistance programme for vulnerable populations. This 
suspension was triggered by the Al-Shabaab attack on WFP offices in August 2009 in Buale and 
Wajid, where seven international staff were posted. Thereafter, WFP continued working using 
national staff only; however, new developments soon led to their withdrawal as well.  
</p>
<p>26. Following the above incident, an 11-point list of demands was issued by Al-Shabaab, 
which included a number of restrictions to be placed on the local population. These included 
banning of women from working for the United Nations and payment of USD 30,000 every six 
months for the security of United Nations staff. The United Nations as a whole rejected these 
conditions. As a result, the central shura of Al-Shabaab issued a directive whereby, as from 1 
January 2010, no food would be allowed in from abroad. Only locally procured food would be 
permitted. On 18 December 2009, WFP decided to suspend its operation in the south-central 
region.  
</p>
<p>27. An important development in recent months has been the emergence of new group 
dynamics of the Islamist forces. The conflict between clan dynamics and the moderate Sufi 
tradition of Islam, on the one hand, and the stern Wahabi/Salafi tradition of Islam that was being 
imposed in urban areas by jihadists from outside, on the other, are important elements to bear in 
mind in understanding the evolving situation in south-central Somalia.  
</p>
<p>28. Two new dimensions are being introduced by the Islamist forces to the conflict in Somalia: 
international jihad elements in Somalia are being linked to the Al-Huti insurrection in Yemen 
and the Al-Quds Brigade of Palestine; and jihad is being used as a political tool and the Al-
Shabaab operations are being professionalized. Their operations are now planned well in 
advance and implemented with greater precision and brutality. Such professionalism was not 
present in 2008.  
</p>
<p>29. Al-Shabaab appears to be operating not just within the traditional clan system in Somalia 
but also by accommodating minorities that lack the protection of the major clans. It is also 
promoting inter-ethnic marriages. Its ally Hizbul Islam controls access to the Afgoye Corridor. It 
also controls the port city of Kismayo and is generating income by imposing local taxes and 
levies on the international khat trade. Al-Shabaab&#8217;s relationship with the local population varies 
from location to location. Although it has managed to gain support of the local population in 
many places, its extreme interpretation of sharia law (including corporal punishment imposed 
through summary, if any, proceedings and the strictest dress code), have alienated the sympathy 
of women in particular. It has taken over United Nations property and premises in many places 
and is doing business with its equipment. There are indications that Al-Shabaab is cash-starved.  </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>30. The regionalization and internationalization of the Somali conflict with the introduction of 
Al-Qaida elements and the impact of piracy-related activities in Puntland could be a threat to 
international peace and security. Somalia for Yemen is becoming like Pakistan for Afghanistan.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Meetings with refugees in Dadaab, Kenya 
</b></p>
<p>31. The independent expert&#8217;s talks with newly arrived refugees from Somalia at the Dadaab 
refugee camps in Kenya were, as before, his main source of first-hand information on the 
situation in Mogadishu and the south-central region. His other source was newly arriving IDPs in 
Bossaso, Puntland. 
</p>
<p>32. During his previous visits to the Dadaab camps, refugees had expressed a rather positive 
view of hard-line Islamists. During this visit, the expert was struck by the anger refugees felt 
towards such Islamists. Women were particularly vocal in opposing their extreme interpretation 
of sharia law, corporal punishments &#8211; including floggings and amputations &#8211; and the requirement 
for women to cover their faces fully. They felt such an interpretation was in conflict with Somali 
culture and the Islam to which they were accustomed. Therefore, they did not at present see any 
alternative to the Transitional Federal Government. If Al-Shabaab took control of Mogadishu 
and the south-central region, none of the IDPs would return to those areas. Many had fled the 
region to protect their children from forcible recruitment by Islamists. They warned that such 
recruitment could spread to the refugee camps.  
</p>
<p>33. The refugees with whom the independent expert spoke called for greater military and 
financial support for the Government from the international community. They urged the expert 
to seek support for the Government to create job opportunities in Somalia, which would relieve 
the situation for the population.  
</p>
<p>34. The refugees also called for higher education opportunities for young boys and girls who 
had completed their secondary schooling in the camps. In this respect, the independent expert 
noted with appreciation that, in line with his previous recommendation, the World University 
Service of Canada had provided 28 scholarships to Somali refugees in 2009. Similarly, Egypt 
and Malaysia had provided the Government with a number of scholarships for Somali students.  
</p>
<p>35. As in the past, the refugees once again emphasized the importance of being involved in the 
peace process. The independent expert was heartened to hear Somali refugees claiming that, 
while their country was experiencing war and violence, they were practising democracy and 
respect for human rights in the camps, as representatives were elected from within communities 
and all decisions were taken after free and fair discussions prior to their endorsement by 
UNHCR. 
</p>
<p>36. According to UNHCR reports, there are presently some 310,000 Somali refugees in Kenya 
(another 163,000 in Yemen, and about 100,000 in Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Uganda, among 
others). New arrivals in Kenya had continued unabated, although the numbers were not as high 
as one year previously. In December 2009, some 3,329 refugees arrived in Kenya, while the 
corresponding figure in January 2009 was 8,894 (2, 134 arrived in Yemen in December 2009). 
The single greatest reason given by the refugees for seeking refuge abroad was insecurity.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>III. DEVELOPMENTS IN POLITICAL, SECURITY  
AND HUMANITARIAN FIELDS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Political developments 
</b></p>
<p>37.<b> </b>The Transitional Federal Government celebrated, on 29 January 2010, its first anniversary 
as a government of national unity in Mogadishu. On this occasion, the President highlighted the 
achievements of the transitional federal institutions, noting that significant advances had been 
made in re-establishing the Somali security forces and institution-building. He announced 
Government plans in 2010 to look to strengthening institutions providing essential services, such 
as education and health. He reiterated his call to all Somalis to join the peace process. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>38. On 15 December 2009, the High-Level Committee established under the Djibouti peace 
process met in Nairobi, chaired by UNPOS. The Somali delegation was led by the Prime 
Minister. Participants discussed the Government&#8217;s initiatives to engage groups still outside the 
peace process. They also discussed the Government&#8217;s preparation of a six-month budget and its 
efforts to finance some of its programmes through its own resources. They underlined the critical 
role of security stabilization as a precondition for successful implementation of humanitarian and 
recovery programmes in the country. The meeting further welcomed the documents that the 
Government had prepared for the International Contact Group meeting which subsequently took 
place in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on 17 December 2009 under the auspices of the Organization of 
the Islamic Conference and Saudi Arabia. Over 120 delegates from Governments and institutions 
attended the meeting. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>39. As a follow-up to the Jeddah meeting, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
for Somalia, accompanied by the Commissioner for Peace and Security of the African Union, 
visited Mogadishu on 25 January 2010. They discussed with the Government a wide range of 
issues, including the international community&#8217;s support to Somalia, human rights, the fight 
against impunity and humanitarian assistance. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Security situation 
</b></p>
<p>40. The renewed fighting in Mogadishu has once again exposed the vulnerability of the 
civilian population &#8211; especially women and children &#8211; to violence and inhuman suffering. As in 
the past, there have been allegations of the use of improvised explosive devices and 
indiscriminate firing of mortars into areas populated or frequented by civilians by all parties to 
the conflict, without respect for provisions of international humanitarian law. As a result, civilian 
deaths and casualties, including of women and young children, have been significant. Massive 
displacement of the population has continued, with access of the affected population to 
humanitarian assistance restricted. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>41. On 3 December 2009, hard-line Islamists launched one of their most brutal attacks 
targeting prominent Somalis, including Government ministers, students and journalists. The </p>

 <p> 
attack took place in the meeting hall of Shamo Hotel in Mogadishu, where hundreds of people 
were attending a graduation ceremony, only the second in 20 years. The independent expert 
strongly condemned the attack in a public statement.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>42. At least 30 people were killed and 80 injured in Somalia following violent confrontations 
between various factions from 29 December 2009 to 5 January 2010. Six people were reported to 
have died, while 50 more were injured, when Al-Shabaab allegedly fired mortars at the 
presidential palace in Mogadishu on 1 February 2010. On 30 January 2010, at least 19 people, 
among them women and children, were reported killed when Al-Shabaab attacked Government 
and African Union bases in Mogadishu.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Humanitarian situation 
</b></p>
<p>43. The humanitarian situation in Somalia continues to be severely affected by the ongoing 
fighting, particularly in the south-central region. Factors which continue to drive the protracted 
and complex humanitarian emergency in Somalia include the following: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Armed conflict in the south-central region which creates generalized insecurity and 
conditions that increase criminality and protection concerns, all of which lead to a 
reduction in access for humanitarian actors. Eight humanitarian aid workers were killed 
between January and October 2009 and ten are still being held captive in Somalia. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Significant internal population displacement, particularly in and around Mogadishu and 
along the Afgoye Corridor, owing to conflict, with increasing displacement due to 
drought and loss of livelihood in other parts of Somalia. As a result of the major attack 
launched in May 2009 by hard-line armed groups, the Afgoye Corridor has become 
home to an estimated 360,000 IDPs. It is reported that over 150,000 of these IDPs have 
arrived in the corridor since May 2009, mainly fleeing Mogadishu-based violence. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; An economic crisis prompted by a devalued currency, continuing high food prices and a 
sharp decrease in remittances from the diaspora; and 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A severe drought in parts of the south-central region that expanded northward into 
Somaliland and Puntland, affecting a large number of pastoral and agro-pastoral 
communities. 
</p>
<p>44. On 2 February 2010, UNHCR reported a sharp rise in violence in Somalia in January 
which regrettably left nearly 260 civilians dead, in addition to uprooting over 80,000 and causing 
widespread destruction. According to UNHCR, many IDPs are sleeping in the open with little 
shelter and water. There are growing concerns about health conditions of particularly vulnerable 
groups such as children, women and the elderly.<b>2</b>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>IV. HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN THE  
SOUTH-CENTRAL REGION 
</b></p>
<p>45. The new Transitional Federal Government was greeted initially with some optimism by the 
local population in Mogadishu in January 2009. There was general expectation that the human 
rights situation would improve. However, President Sheikh Sharif&#8217;s Government was heavily 
challenged by hard-line Islamist opposition groups, principally Al-Shabaab and Hizbul Islam, 
beginning with a major offensive for control of Mogadishu on 7 May 2009. Outside Mogadishu, 
which was itself only partly controlled by Government forces, alliances between and within 
armed groups changed constantly, resulting in a continuing volatile situation in south-central 
Somalia. In some areas not controlled by either Al-Shabaab, Hizbul Islam or the Transitional 
Federal Government, local administrations were set up by local communities, where the situation 
was slightly better.  
</p>
<p>46. As the fighting between the Government and the armed Islamists (and in some places 
within the armed groups) was primarily concentrated in the south-central region, it is there that 
most of the human rights violations occurred. The spillover effect was also felt in the north.   
</p>
<p>47. In the absence of an effective central Government and in the context of ongoing armed 
conflicts, civilians, especially women and children, continued to suffer from indiscriminate 
attacks and retaliatory acts from both sides. The continuous flow of arms to all parties to the 
conflict and the lack of accountability for serious violations of human rights and humanitarian 
law exacerbated the culture of impunity. Below is a summary of human rights violations suffered 
by the population in the south-central region grouped under four broad categories.  
</p>
<p><b>A.  The right to life and physical integrity 
</b></p>
<p>48. The horrific attacks by hard-line Islamists during the period under review left a large 
number of persons dead and wounded. The most devastating of such attacks was the suicide 
bombing of the graduation ceremony of medical students, mentioned earlier, on 3 December 
2009. Protection of civilians in the conflict thus remains one of the most serious concerns in 
relation to the right to life and physical integrity. Conducting hostilities in an urban area, with 
Al-Shabaab taking up positions and firing from civilian areas, and retaliatory fire from 
Government forces supported by AMISOM inevitably increased the risks to the civilians. There 
have been allegations that the principles of proportionality and of only attacking clearly 
identified military targets have not been respected. The introduction of suicide-bombing by the 
insurgents has added a new dimension to the conflict.   <b> 
</b></p>
<p>49. The AMISOM troops who guarded Mogadishu and key Government installations were 
themselves frequently targeted by the Islamists. The worst incident of this kind occurred in 
September 2009 when the Deputy Force Commander and at least 17 peacekeepers were killed in 
coordinated suicide attacks on AMISOM troops. Retaliatory attacks by the latter reportedly also 
caused civilian casualties.  </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>50. To topple the Transitional Federal Government at any cost, the Islamist forces were 
reported not to have spared even hospitals and the surviving medical institutions in Mogadishu. 
It has been reported that, on 25 January 2010, they carried out a vicious attack on a hospital 
behind Mogadishu Airport run by AMISOM, killing innocent Somali patients. This was 
reportedly the second attack on this health centre which treats Somali civilians. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Freedom of opinion and expression 
</b></p>
<p>51. As in most conflict situations, freedom of opinion and expression have become a particular 
victim in the south-central region. To muzzle the media, targeted attacks by the Islamist 
opposition have claimed the lives of media executives, reporters, photojournalists and 
cameramen working with electronic media. Large numbers of journalists have also been 
wounded and arrested. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>52. According to the National Union of Somali Journalists, in 2009, nine journalists were 
killed either in the line of duty or in targeted, brutal attacks, making Somalia the most dangerous 
place for journalists in Africa. Seven out of the nine journalists were killed in Mogadishu. One 
was killed in Afgoye and another in Beledweyne. A total of 12 journalists were wounded and 15 
others arrested in Somalia in 2009. Another 100 journalists reportedly received death threats, 
causing many of them to leave their respective areas or to exercise self-censorship. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>53. Domestic violence victimizing women continues to be a major problem in all parts of 
Somalia. Women victims of sexual and gender-based violence have no functioning judicial 
system to which they can turn. Rape and other forms of sexual and gender-based violence are 
dealt with by clans as a civil dispute, not involving the victim, and are often solved by either the 
payment of blood money or a forced marriage between the victim and the perpetrator. 
</p>
<p>54. Women reportedly continue to face cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment on a daily 
basis, particularly in Al-Shabaab-controlled areas. On 18 November 2009, according to reports 
from a village near the town of Wajid, a 20-year-old divorcee woman accused of committing 
adultery was taken to an open area where she was buried up to her waist and then stoned to death 
in front of a large crowd.  
</p>
<p>55. It may be mentioned in this connection that men are also subjected to inhuman and cruel 
treatment for their illicit relationships with women. In November 2009, a man was stoned to 
death for rape in the port town of Merka. Under the Al-Shabaab&#8217;s interpretation of sharia law, 
anyone who was ever married &#8211; even a divorcee &#8211; who has an affair, is liable to be found guilty 
of adultery and punished by stoning to death. Following this incident, the independent expert 
issued a public statement and strongly condemned executions by stoning in Al-Shabaab-
controlled areas, urging all Islamist groups and religious leaders to abide by human rights and 
international humanitarian law obligations.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Children&#8217;s rights 
</b></p>
<p>56. The major violation of human rights of children is the recruitment of child soldiers by all 
parties to the conflict in Somalia. The Islamists normally recruit them from Madrasas and 
Koranic schools. A survey commissioned by UNICEF revealed the alarming scale and nature of 
child recruitment. Children are being recruited, even for use on the front line, and are the victims 
of rape and other forms of sexual violence. Children&#8217;s education continues to suffer as more and 
more schools close as a result of the conflict, especially in Mogadishu. 
</p>
<p>57. Despite this grim picture, the good news is that UNICEF efforts benefited some 1.8 million 
people in 2009, mostly children, with basic health and nutrition services provided through, inter 
alia, a network of maternal and child health centres. Child health days &#8211; including an essential 
life-saving health and nutrition package &#8211; benefited over 1 million children under 5 and 800,000 
women of childbearing age. These interventions were able to reach even most difficult areas, 
such as Afgoye and parts of Mogadishu, in south Somalia. UNICEF also supported access to 
quality education for more than 157,000 emergency-affected children by providing school 
supplies and textbooks.  
</p>
<p><b>V. HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN PUNTLAND 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Meeting with the Puntland Government 
</b></p>
<p>58.<b> </b>In the absence of the President of Puntland, the independent expert met with the Vice-
President, Abdi Samed, and the entire cabinet on 20 January 2010. The independent expert 
believes that their readiness for such a meeting could be taken as evidence of their commitment 
to his mandate. The discussions were focused primarily on the human rights situation of IDPs, 
the policy response of the Government to piracy and human trafficking. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>59. Out of 1.5 million IDPs in Somalia, Puntland hosts 104,000. The Vice-President reiterated 
the commitment of the authorities to continuing to welcome them; however, with limited 
resources, Puntland felt overburdened with IDPs and refugees and asylum-seekers from Ethiopia 
and Eritrea. The Puntland Government sees the new arrivals as a major security threat in the 
context of infiltration of hard-line Islamists from the south. It claimed that some IDPs had 
committed politically motivated assassinations. This led the Government at one point to ask 
IDPs to return to places in the south of the country where there was peace. The independent 
expert urged the Government to continue to protect the rights and freedoms of IDPs and drew 
attention to the report of the Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of 
internally displaced persons, who visited Somalia from 14 to 21 October 2009.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>60. With regard to piracy off the Somali coasts and the huge sums of money it generates 
through ransom payment, the Puntland Government considered that it posed a threat not only for 
Somalia but for the region as a whole. Millions of US dollars are paid to organized pirates in 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>3</b>  A/HRC/13/21/Add.2. </p>

 <p> 
ransom, who see this as a lucrative industry compared to spending many weeks at sea in search 
of fish. With poor or no Government patrolling, the Somali coast is today home to heavily armed 
pirates who capture maritime fleets or fishing boats for ransom.  
</p>
<p>61. The effect of piracy and the income it generates on a pastoralist society such as Somalia 
can be well imagined. In a society where the weight of tradition is used to regulate social life, 
piracy is helping to destroy social structures. Pirates who earn a lot of money are playing an 
increased role in the society that has led, inter alia, to trafficking in persons, in particular of 
women and young girls. The pirates&#8217; connections with the clan system undermine the efforts of 
the local authorities to hold them accountable. Advocacy activities engaging community leaders, 
traditional elders and Islamic scholars to prevent new recruitment and convince pirates to engage 
in a normal social reintegration have been undertaken by the Government. More than 200 pirates 
have been arrested and 21 boats, 8 vehicles and large quantity of arms and ammunitions 
confiscated from pirates. The Puntland authorities have managed to free hostages and repossess 
fishing boats captured by the pirates belonging to neighbouring Yemeni and Omani fishermen. 
The political will of Puntland is not sufficient to fight against the phenomenon unless the 
international community is committed to dealing with the realities on the ground, including the 
protection of the right to Somalis to fish freely in their water and develop accountability 
mechanisms against foreign vessels dumping toxic and nuclear wastes in Somali waters. 
</p>
<p>62. With regard to human trafficking, thousands of Somali teenagers flee war and chaos in 
south-central Somalia and sail to Yemen, where officials who have long welcomed Somali 
refugees are now concerned that extremist elements could find growing Somali refugee camps in 
Yemen a fertile ground for recruiting and human trafficking. Human smuggling is thus a major 
concern for the Puntland authorities. It is attracting vulnerable IDPs and illegal migrants from 
Ethiopia and Eritrea to choose this path.  
</p>
<p>63. The independent expert was pleased to learn from his meeting with Abdi Yasin, the 
Deputy Minister of Interior of Puntland, whom he met separately in Bossaso, that the latter had 
not only read the expert&#8217;s most recent report to the Human Rights Council, but also taken action 
to deal with the concern the expert had expressed therein about the terrible detention conditions 
of the central prison in Garowe, in particular keeping prisoners in shackles. Concerning IDPs, he 
informed the expert that young pastoralists who once used to walk long distances behind their 
camels in the vast pastures of Somalia were now playing with millions of US dollars generated 
by piracy. The consequence of this on Somali society is a matter for serious reflection by all 
concerned. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  General comments on the human rights situation in Puntland 
</b></p>
<p>64. It appears to the independent expert that the Government of Puntland has made some 
significant achievements in reorganizing police and security forces and shown its commitment to 
rule of law and democracy. However, a continuous influx of new arrivals of IDPs from the 
south-central region, piracy and human trafficking are challenging the stability of Puntland. 
Whatever the reason, the high-handedness of Government&#8217;s response to what it considers to be 
threats emanating from Islamist infiltrators coming from the south remain a matter of concern. 
There have been reports of arrest/harassment of IDPs, refugees, asylum-seekers, journalists and 
those involved in the media.  </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>65. From the independent expert&#8217;s meeting with representatives of Puntland civil society, he 
learnt about the gaps that existed with regard to human rights, rule of law and access to justice. 
He was pleased to learn that, with UNDP funds provided under a project, a team of 15 lawyers 
and 16 paralegals have been employed to improve access to justice for vulnerable groups, 
particularly through monitoring human rights violations committed against minorities, IDPs, 
economic migrants and refugees. One representative raised a concern about the limited capacity 
of the judiciary when the region was witnessing increased criminality generated by the influx of 
mixed migrants and related human trafficking.  
</p>
<p>66. Only a limited number of judges are trained to apply the criminal law inherited from Italy. 
Murder cases are more often than not dealt with under sharia law. The same judge could decide 
to apply both the Italian-inherited criminal law and sharia law in a case. While the majority of 
the population appears to be in favour of the application of sharia law, the issue of harmonization 
of the various Somali laws appears not to be a priority. Minorities who lack the protection of the 
major clans are likely to be victims of the discrepancies between customary, criminal and sharia 
law. 
</p>
<p>67. From his visit to an IDP camp in Bossaso, the independent expert learnt that, while the 
living conditions in the camp, like those of the local population in the vicinity, remain harsh, the 
relative stability of Puntland provides the IDPs with opportunities to improve their social and 
economic conditions. For the women and children in the camp (who are in the majority), the lack 
of physical security, rape and other instances of sexual and gender-based violence in and around 
the settlements and domestic violence are reported to be common. Access to primary education 
for internally displaced children and health care at the General Hospital of Bossasso remain 
limited. Despite this, however, many IDPs said they preferred the durable solution of local 
reintegration to risking travelling to Yemen or returning to the south of the country. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN SOMALILAND 
</b></p>
<p>68<b>. </b>During his visit to Somaliland, the independent expert had the opportunity to meet with the 
Minister of Justice, the Minister of Interior, the Speaker of the House of Elders, members of civil 
society organizations and the President of the Somaliland Human Rights Commission. He also 
visited the Mandhera prison outside Hargeisa and interacted with students of Hargeisa 
University. These exchanges, in addition to briefings from United Nations agencies, provided a 
good insight into the human rights situation in Somaliland. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Access to justice and rule of law 
</b></p>
<p>69.<b> </b>The independent expert expresses his gratitude to the Minister of Justice for his frankness 
in discussing the human rights of IDPs, refugees and asylum-seekers and some discrepancies 
relating to rule of law and access to justice. The Minister sought to underline the Government&#8217;s 
efforts to improve access to justice. He stated that there were now some 100 judges employed 
across Somaliland. The judges resort to a combination of civil, customary and sharia law, but 
only a small number of judges have appropriate legal qualifications in these fields.  
</p>
<p>70. The expert raised with the Minister concerns that he had heard that the courts at all levels 
in Somaliland failed to challenge arbitrary and illegal detention of journalists, human rights 
defenders and &#8220;undisciplined&#8221; juveniles. The Constitution of Somaliland requires that </p>

 <p> 
individuals taken into custody be brought before a judge within 48 hours of arrest. Police 
officials regularly flout this requirement and judges do normally not challenge them. Journalists 
are often targets of intimidation and abuse by Government officials. While detention sometimes 
last only a few hours, the fact remains that Government officials at all levels and the police have, 
for example, ordered on occasions arrests of journalists in response simply to critical reporting, 
or to pre-empt such reporting.  
</p>
<p>71. According to the Minister of Justice, many journalists lacked professionalism and had 
never studied or got a degree on journalism. It was important that they abide by the rules and 
regulations governing media ethics. He, however, readily recognized concerns relating to abuses 
committed by the regional security committees.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Human rights violations committed by the regional security committees 
</b></p>
<p>72. The main problem with the regional security committees was that their acts were, 
according to a scholar, &#8220;based on Siyad Barre&#8217;s draconian decrees and not the 1963 law.&#8221;<b>4</b> The 
1963 Public Order Law did not grant broad powers of detention and other extraordinary powers 
to the authorities, expect in a state of emergency. The current Somaliland administration, 
however, claims that the law makes the security committees legal and gives them the power to 
detain anyone &#8220;seen as a menace to public order&#8221;. However, the committees are primarily used 
not for alleged national security offences, but to deal with ordinary criminal and juvenile cases in 
order to save the Government the trouble of proving charges in court.  
</p>
<p>73. It appears to independent expert that the regional security committees are used in some 
regions of Somaliland as much as or even more frequently than the courts to incarcerate people, 
including juveniles. During his visit to the Mandhera prison, the expert was shocked to see that a 
large number of juveniles were in jail at the request of parents who alleged that their children 
were disobedient, involved with gangs, drank alcohol or were violent. Many were not accused of 
anything amounting to a criminal offence under the law but were simply sent there by the 
regional security committees who took decisions based on traditional Somali law, or <i>Xeer</i>. The 
expert was, in particular, saddened to see a teacher being held in jail to protect him from clan 
revenge for a murder committed by his cousin who fled to Kenya and was believed to be dead. 
Although, the expert respects the local culture and tradition, a way must be found to deal with 
individual and collective fundamental freedoms in compliance with international standards. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Need for capacity-building 
</b></p>
<p>74. The circumstances detailed above underline the importance of capacity-building in 
Somaliland to improve compliance of law enforcement officials with human rights standards. 
Training of the police and security forces is particularly necessary, and the expert believes that 
UNPOS Human Rights Unit could play an important role in this regard, in collaboration with 
UNDP. The Minister of Interior stressed his Government&#8217;s disappointment at the suspension of 
</p>

 <p> 
the police training programme by UNDP. On the question of human rights violations committed 
by the regional security committees, the Minister believed that could be resolved in the context 
of a broader reform of justice undertaken under the UNDP Rule of Law and Security 
Programme. 
</p>
<p><b>VII.  OBSERVATIONS ON THE SITUATION IN SOMALIA 
</b></p>
<p>75. The situation in Somalia has continued to be one of the most difficult humanitarian crises 
in the world in recent years. It is also among the most dangerous for all concerned &#8211; the people, 
the warring factions and the international community as a whole. The security situation has 
worsened, with more lethal fighting. As a result, the humanitarian and human rights situation 
continues to be deplorable. Too many people are being killed, maimed, gagged, silenced, 
humiliated, made homeless and displaced within and outside the country. It is a free-for-all<b> 
</b>situation, with total impunity. What is happening to the people of Somalia is a scandal and a blot 
on humanity&#8217;s conscience. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>76. This unconscionable state of affairs appears to have been endless. Two decades of 
suffering of a people is too long. There are, of course, other such crises in the world &#8211; in 
Afghanistan, Iraq, Palestine, Sudan, etc. &#8211; but in all these, international efforts have been 
engaged, more or less, in finding solutions. In Somalia, there has been no sustained international 
effort. What the United Nations and others are doing can only be described as first aid. As a 
result, the situation has gone from bad to worse; if it is allowed to fester, it can only deteriorate.  
</p>
<p>77. By all indications, Somalia is turning into a hot spot for international terrorism which, left 
unattended, is bound to spill over to neighbouring countries. Equally importantly, the growing 
menace of piracy in and around Somalia waters is fast assuming alarming proportions given its 
exploitation by professional criminal syndicates. It is no longer the work of some unemployed 
youths looking for a livelihood and easy money. The criminals are taking advantage of the lack 
of an effective central Government. The international community must act fast and in a united 
manner to prevent the situation from deteriorating further.  
</p>
<p>78. The independent expert believes that the time has come for the international community to 
take a fresh look at the situation in Somalia and consider what has been done to find a solution to 
the Somali crisis. The first step would be to take stock of the peace process initiated by the 
Djibouti Agreement of 2008, by asking the following questions: is it working as envisioned; if 
not, what factors are impeding the process; what would help to move it forward; and is there a 
need to amend the process?  
</p>
<p>79. A year ago, the independent had been more upbeat and optimistic about Somalia, but that 
had changed in the last six months. He had expected that the new Transitional Federal 
Government would act fast to consolidate the goodwill with which it began. He thought that the 
opposition forces would suffer from dwindling popular support. He felt that the withdrawal of 
Ethiopian troops from Somalia, war fatigue of the population and imposition of a harsh alien 
version of sharia law on the people would weaken the position of the hard-line Islamists. 
However, there is no clear indication to that effect, nor is there any indication that the 
Government is gaining the upper hand.  </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>80. It can, of course, be said that more time is needed for the efforts of Government to bear 
fruit. While that is true, it is also true that Al-Shabaab also appears to be gaining ground in the 
mean time. Al-Shabaab should either be halted or weakened or won over; the independent expert 
believes that the latter two strategies have the best chance of success, as he sees little chance of 
the Government prevailing through military means alone.  
</p>
<p>81. From his talks with newly arriving refugees in Dadaab camps, IDPs in Bossaso and others, 
the independent expert is of the view that the people still see the Transitional Federal 
Government as the best option for governance, although they are not yet convinced of its ability. 
The Government will have to work hard and imaginatively to consolidate the Somali people&#8217;s 
support. If it succeeds, the expert foresees defections from opposition ranks, particularly from 
the nationalist elements among the hard-liners. To facilitate the process, the Government must 
have a clear strategy to provide necessary concessions, offers and welcome to those who wish to 
defect.  
</p>
<p>82. For the Government&#8217;s strategy to succeed, the independent expert believes there is a need 
for greater involvement of the people of Somalia. It has so far appeared that the people have not 
been significantly involved in the peace/reconciliation process. Refugees in Kenya and Yemen 
have time and again pleaded not only for their own involvement in the peace process, but also 
for the involvement of clans, their leaders, business people and the diaspora, inter alia. The 
Government&#8217;s policy paper referred to earlier involved all those groups. Is it not possible to start 
a process in the near future where all these groups may be consulted, either together or 
separately? Whatever the outcome, the process itself will send a message to all concerned that 
without popular support, neither the Government nor the opposition can prevail.   
</p>
<p>83. Consultations should take place in Somalia itself, wherever feasible. An effort must be 
made to move away from what is referred to above as &#8220;Nairobi syndrome&#8221;. The Government 
should be seen to be consulting with the people as much as with other Governments and the 
United Nations. Refugees in Dadaab told the independent expert that they wanted to see 
members of the Transitional Federal Government and Somali Parliament visit them in the 
refugee camps regularly and observe how they lived. There is a need for the Government to 
show compassion for the people.  
</p>
<p>84. The independent expert remains concerned that the hub of United Nations activities for 
Somalia is still in Nairobi not Somalia. While many local staff and some international staff are 
posted in Somalia, the expert asks why is it not possible to move some or most of the United 
Nations country offices for Somalia to Somalia itself, at least to areas where there is relative 
peace, say in Somaliland and Puntland. While a wholesale move may not yet be possible, a start 
could be made, as the expert has been informed that a site for common United Nations 
compound in Mogadishu has already been identified. It would reportedly not be impossible to 
make arrangements for additional secure premises for the United Nations and accommodation 
for its staff in Somaliland and Puntland, although it would require the political will of the United 
Nations and some investment.  
</p>
<p>85. There would, of course, be serious worries in the beginning, as the opposition forces would 
not like to see the United Nations move to Somalia fully. Nevertheless, the effects of the move 
on the minds of the people of Somali and the confidence it would generate would likely to pay 
early, rich dividends, neutralizing the scare tactics of the opposition. The independent expert </p>

 <p> 
welcomes that the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Somalia is personally 
inclined to set up the base of his operations in Somalia, in Mogadishu. His office could become 
an example for others. 
</p>
<p>86. It appears to the independent expert that it would be a tremendous psychological boost for 
the refugees and the people of Somalia if the Government could announce that it would welcome 
qualified refugees now living in camps abroad who return home to help the Government to run 
the various affairs of the State. The Somali diaspora is already helping the Government in many 
ways, so why not the refugees?

<p><b>VIII.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  For the Transitional Federal Government 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Government has the primary responsibility for providing protection to its 
population, despite its limited capacity. The Government must, therefore, ensure relevant 
training for all concerned on basic standards of international humanitarian and human 
rights laws.  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The Government&#8217;s recent decision to ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
should be turned into law as soon as possible, thus clearly demonstrating the Government&#8217;s 
political will to follow international standards in this and other fields. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Government has the key role to play in the success of the Somalia peace process. 
It has been entrusted by the people of Somalia, through a unique representational process, 
to bring the long-standing conflict in Somalia to an end by all possible means, including 
thorough negotiations and reconciliation. It is for the Government, therefore, to take the 
initiative in making the peace and reconciliation process work. In this respect, the 
independent expert welcomes the recent initialling of an agreement ahead of the signing of 
the Framework for Cooperation, between the Government and Ahlu Sunnah. This is an 
important step in expanding and broadening the scope of dialogue and reconciliation in 
Somalia.  
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>When it assumed office, the Government inherited a rich reservoir of knowledge and 
experience and a large number of lessons learned from all past experiences of peacemaking 
in Somalia. These lessons should be identified, made public and used as a guide for the 
Government.  
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>While most, if not all Somalis, are fiercely attached to their clan identity and wish to 
ensure proper clan representation in any future Government set-up, they are also keen to 
maintain the territorial integrity of their country and live together in an arrangement that 
recognizes local/regional differences and provides for rule of law and good governance. The 
Government should therefore focus on securing peoples&#8217; confidence in its efforts in this 
regard through strengthening the institutions of rule of law and good governance. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>To ensure rule of law and good governance, the Government should begin by 
removing corrupt, inefficient or uncommitted Government officials and replace them with 
dedicated, properly trained and people-friendly officials. The recent change of ill-reputed </b></p>

 <p> 
<b>security and police chiefs was well received by the people. The Government should set 
clear-cut standards for good governance, with proper norms and principles. The setting up 
of a national human rights commission (through the constitution-drafting process) and 
human rights courts would also send positive signals to the people. A firm announcement 
by the Government that it is seeking to banish the culture of impunity altogether from 
Somalia is of paramount importance.  
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The Government should consider arranging consultation meetings with a broad 
range of people to seek their views on affairs of the State and, in particular, the future 
Constitution of Somalia, to let people know that their views matter, although this will not 
be easy given the country&#8217;s circumstances. The consultations could take place on a 
geographical, group or gender basis, as appropriate. They should, however, take place 
within Somalia, wherever possible.  
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The Government should make arrangements for visits by Government ministers and 
senior officials to refugee camps in Kenya and Yemen and seek refugees&#8217; views on whether 
they would be interested in returning home under proper arrangements and working for 
the Government. In addition, Government ministers and senior officials simply visiting the 
camps regularly would boost the morale of the refugees. Similar arrangements should also 
be made for visits by members of the Parliament and other transitional federal institutions. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The Government should also focus on three other key issues which emerged from the 
independent expert&#8217;s talks with the refugees in particular. These are: creation of livelihood 
opportunities; reopening of schools and support to education institutions; and 
strengthening medical services. Such work should be conducted in parallel with 
Government efforts to end insurgency. There is no alternative to the Government&#8217;s efforts 
to help the youth, for example, to withstand financial inducement offered by the insurgents 
to join them.  
</b></p>
<p><b>B.  For the Somaliland authorities 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>While the independent expert acknowledges the Somaliland authorities&#8217; efforts to 
improve rule of law and democracy, he urges them to put an end to the practice of the 
regional and district security committees ordering arrest and detention and imposing 
prison sentences or other penalties by bypassing the courts. Appropriate measures should 
be taken to release all persons currently imprisoned by the security committees or charge 
them for cognizable criminal offences before regular criminal courts.  
</b></p>
<p><b>C.  For the Puntland authorities 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>While appreciating the efforts of the Puntland authorities to host IDPs despite 
legitimate security concerns, the independent expert urges them to refrain from 
threatening to expel IDPs to the south or any other area. Women and young girls should be 
protected from rape, domestic violence and sexual and gender-based violence and provided 
with health care, psychosocial and rehabilitation and redress support.  </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>D.  For the opposition groups 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The independent expert urges all the opposition forces, in particular Al-Shabaab and 
Hizbul Islam, to seriously engage with the Government in negotiating a peaceful settlement 
to the conflict in Somalia. Some are reportedly already involved in the process and the 
expert urges others to engage soon for the sake of the people of Somalia, who have long 
suffered some of the worst violations of human rights and humanitarian law in the world. 
He also recalls that, as long as they are still fighting, their troops should respect the basic 
principles of human rights and humanitarian law. The independent expert would welcome 
communications from them in this or any other regard. 
</b></p>
<p><b>E.  For the United Nations 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>Although the United Nations consolidated appeal for Somalia is underfunded, there 
are some key activities that the United Nations must nevertheless continue. These include 
humanitarian assistance by WFP, UNICEF activities in relation to women and children, 
the role of UNESCO in the field of education, the role of UNDP in constitution-building 
and implementation of the Rule of Law and Security Programme, the role of UNHCR for 
refugees and IDPs and the role of the UNPOS Human Rights Unit in standard-setting in 
the field of human rights and humanitarian laws. Many of these activities relate to 
capacity-building and standard-setting and are important for the Government&#8217;s efforts in 
relation to rule of law and good governance.  
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>The key United Nations agencies should consider moving their country offices to 
Somalia as soon as possible. This should be possible with the construction of more secure 
office spaces and staff accommodation in the safer areas of Somalia. What is needed is the 
political will. There are many difficult places in the world where security situation is 
perhaps more precarious but where full-fledged United Nations offices nevertheless exist.  
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>The independent expert welcomes that the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General for Somalia himself is in favour of moving his office to Somalia and has initiated 
measures in this regard, and suggests that the Human Rights Unit also moves with him. In 
any case, the Unit&#8217;s staff should move to safer areas of Somalia as soon as possible and 
their numbers increased. In 2009, despite many promises, there has been no increase in its 
staff of two; this is too few a number to cover a country like Somalia. OHCHR itself should 
consider a full-fledged presence in Somalia, as it could do much to promote human rights 
in that country, including monitoring and reporting on human rights violations and 
training and building the capacity of institutions that are capable of providing human 
rights protection.  
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>The independent expert welcomes the deployment of an international consultant by 
OHCHR/UNPOS in October&#8211;November 2009 in Nairobi to assess the feasibility of a 
preliminary documentation assessment on the past and current human rights and 
international humanitarian law abuses as a way of moving forward on impunity and 
accountability. He hopes the recommendations will be actively followed up and reiterates 
the need to establish an appropriate mechanism to combat impunity and hold the 
perpetrators of these potential war crimes and massive human rights and humanitarian 
law violations accountable. </b></p>

 <p> 
103. <b>The independent expert is concerned about the suspension of the humanitarian 
assistance, in particular the discontinuation of the food distribution following the 
restrictions of humanitarian access imposed by extremist armed groups on WFP. The 
United Nations should continue its efforts to keep the long-standing humanitarian crisis in 
Somalia under international focus. He reiterates his call to the Human Rights Council to 
reconsider holding a special session on Somalia and calls upon thematic special procedures 
to consider focusing upon aspects of the situation in Somalia that pertain to their respective 
mandates. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>Given the special circumstances of Somalia, he urges UNHCR to consider extending 
education facilities for Somali refugees beyond the high-school level. Somalia will need 
trained people to fill the Government jobs that will open up when circumstances change. 
UNHCR should also seek more scholarships for higher studies for Somali refugees. 
</b></p>
<p><b>F.  For the international community 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>The international community should substantially increase its financial and technical 
support to the Transitional Federal Government to fulfil its many responsibilities beyond 
the security sector. The Government needs support in undertaking key reforms to establish 
rule of law and good governance. Its success in this regard is fundamental to its success in 
cementing peoples&#8217; support, while such support would in turn help fight insurgency.  
</b></p>
<p>106.<b> He urges all donor Governments to respond generously to the consolidated appeal of 
the United Nations agencies for funds to implement its activities in Somalia. The 
independent expert was saddened to learn that in 2009 it remained largely underfunded. 
Despite its many shortcomings, the United Nations is doing a formidable job in Somalia 
against tremendous odds. It is the main lifeline for many and deserves to be assisted 
adequately. Furthermore, he calls on all Governments to provide scholarships for Somali 
refugee students. Somalia will need such students when peace returns. 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>Piracy, mixed migrations and related human trafficking and terrorism remain major 
concerns in Puntland and Somaliland. As warned by United Nations Office on Drugs and 
Crime, the continued instability in Somalia is transforming East Africa into &#8220;a free 
economic zone for all sorts of trafficking: drugs, migrants, guns&#8221;.</b>5<b> The independent expert 
therefore urges the international community to deal with the realities on the ground of 
these phenomena with the seriousness they deserve. There are thousands of young men and 
girls in Somalia who are unemployed, uneducated and desperate. In this context, the 
combined efforts of the maritime powers to fight the menace militarily are unlikely to stop 
piracy. The time has come to explore and implement a comprehensive approach that 
incorporates a genuine political and economic solution for Somalia. 
</b></p>
<p>                                                 
<b>5</b> Address by Antonio Maria Costa to the Security Council on 8 December 2009. Available from 
http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/about-unodc/speeches/2009-08-12-africa-under-attack.html. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>G.  For the African Union/AMISOM 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>The independent expert recognizes the commendable efforts of AMISOM forces in 
protecting key installations in and around Mogadishu under most challenging security 
conditions. As long as the Transitional Federal Government continues to be supported by 
the international community as the best option for dealing with the situation in Somalia, 
there is no alternative to this. He therefore urges all African Union and OIC countries to 
strengthen AMISOM. In particular, he calls upon all African Union member States that 
have pledged troops to AMISOM to make good their pledges to enable AMISOM to reach 
its authorized strength.  
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>In view of continuing allegations of human rights and humanitarian law violations by 
AMISOM troops, the expert recommends that efforts are undertaken to increase the 
troops&#8217; compliance with the basic standards in those fields. They should, in particular, 
make sure that under no circumstances are populated areas targeted by indiscriminate 
shelling.
