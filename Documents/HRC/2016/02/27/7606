<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its eighteenth session 
from 27 January to 7 February 2014. The review of Eritrea was held at the 12th meeting on 
3 February 2014. The delegation of Eritrea was headed by Tesfamichael Gerahtu. At its 
17th meeting held on 6 February 2014, the Working Group adopted the report on Eritrea. 
</p>
<p>2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Eritrea: Austria, Indonesia and Sierra Leone. 
</p><p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
Eritrea: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/18/ERI/1);  
 (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/18/ERI/2); 
 (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/18/ERI/3).  
</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, 
Liechtenstein, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America was 
transmitted to Eritrea through the troika. Those questions are available on the extranet of 
the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation of Eritrea thanked the States that had sent advance questions and 
concerns as well as expressions of support and stated that Eritrea valued all constructive 
engagements on the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms.  
</p><p>6. The delegation stated that the contents of the UPR report focused mainly on the 
implementation of the accepted recommendations and related issues. It had been prepared 
through a process of broad participation and high responsibility. A steering committee 
composed of representatives from all relevant line ministries and chaired by the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs had been established and civil society organizations were represented in the 
committee. The United Nations country team in Eritrea also provided input. 
</p>
<p>7. Higher level consultations had been carried out, including with law enforcement 
agencies, members of the judiciary, regional administration and civic organizations, on the 
draft laws, which were now ready for proclamation. Furthermore, new laws on access to 
water, food security, privatization of State-owned enterprises and access to justice, as well 
as the accountability of judicial services and the expansion and extended jurisdiction of 
community magistrate courts had been introduced.  
</p>
<p>8. The the Constitution was the source of all legislative measures and the basis of 
economic, social, cultural and political policies and actions. While local and regional </p>


<p>elections had been held, national election remained pending until the threats to national 
security and sovereignty had been eliminated. The delegation acknowledged that more 
effort was needed to establish some institutions provided for in the Constitution. Despite 
challenges and problems, efforts to strengthen the legal system and the rule of law had 
gained significant momentum in the past four years. 
</p>
<p>9. National development efforts focused on the consolidation of all aspects of social 
justice to ensure that every citizen had the ability to lead a life of dignity with development 
in a society that reflected the common values and aspirations. Equal rights and 
opportunities had become the hallmarks of the Government&#8217;s strategic interventions to 
ensure equitable distribution of basic services and the expansion of even development in all 
regions and localities.  
</p>
<p>10. The delegation stated that microcredit schemes for rural farmers, women cooperative 
farms, disadvantaged women, disabled citizens and other needy sections of the community 
had expanded significantly. The major Government institutions, the Eritrean Development 
Bank and other stakeholders had thus increased the level of investment and the degree of 
support to these disadvantaged groups. 
</p>
<p>11. The privatization of Government-owned entities and enterprises and the 
establishment of a privatization agency under the Proclamation issued in 2013 was 
expected to widen the opportunities for all citizens to benefit from the wealth of the nation 
at various levels.  
</p>
<p>12. Programmes to assist all the disadvantaged social groups had been expanded by the 
Government in collaboration with stakeholders and Eritreans inside and outside of the 
country.  
</p>
<p>13. The delegation provided information on the steps taken towards cultural 
transformations as well as to explore the cultural heritage of all the ethnic groups in 
conformity with the ideals of national unity and national development.  
</p>
<p>14. The delegation stated that Eritrea had redoubled its efforts to improve the life style 
and conditions of living of its entire population. The strategy targeting poverty elimination 
and transforming living standards was an ongoing effort.  
</p>
<p>15. The demographic distribution of services by the Government had shown remarkable 
progress in terms of access, coverage and viability. In the previously disadvantaged areas, 
as well as rural sections and periphery parts of the country, there had been continuing 
growth on all social indicators in the past four years.  
</p>
<p>16. Eritrea was on course to achieving three Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 
(Goal 4 on reducing child mortality, Goal 5 on improving maternal health and Goal 6 on 
combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases). It was also on track with four other 
goals.  
</p>
<p>17. With regard to human dignity, the Eritrean Correctional and Rehabilitation Services 
(ECRS) had a major undertaking of rehabilitating and reintegrating convicted prisoners into 
society upon release.  
</p>
<p>18. The delegation stated that torture was criminalized in the domestic legal system and 
thus close monitoring had been an established practice in the past four years. Moreover, 
evidence collected through these means remained inadmissible in courts of law.  
</p>
<p>19. The Government had also continued its strict policy of zero tolerance for all forms 
of sexual violence. Awareness campaigns had been stepped up by all concerned agencies 
and the police had conducted public forums and campaigns in high schools. </p>


<p>20. The delegation stated that any contract of marriage between persons below 18 years 
of age was null and void. Spouses and witnesses to such marriage faced punishment under 
the Penal Code.  
</p>
<p>21. The Government had outlawed the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM) and 
cutting and that an extensive campaign was ongoing. Reported cases submitted to the courts 
had been penalized. However, challenges still remained in addressing that problem, 
including reaching nomadic populations and bringing about behavioural changes through 
knowledge and awareness.  
</p>
<p>22. The rights of the child were at the centre of Government policies and strategies. 
Efforts had been made to strengthen the family unit, provide a better environment for the 
growth and development of children and empower communities to coordinate and promote 
good child care and appropriate socialization practices. The community-based orphan 
reintegration programme had also been successfully expanded..  
</p>
<p>23. The delegation stated that there were no cases of child labour in Eritrea. Children 
were not recruited for labour, but there was a culture, tradition and practice of children 
participating in family activities and work. Raising the monitoring capacity and awareness 
of all concerned were major challenges.  
</p><p>24. The Government had established a probation service to provide counselling and to 
integrate children who had been in conflict with the law into schools and neighbourhoods 
after their release.  
</p>
<p>25. The political and social roles of women in political activities, the elected assemblies, 
administration at local and regional levels and in other government positions had improved 
in the past four years.  
</p>
<p>26. The delegation provided information on the efforts made to bridge the gender gap in 
education and enhance the quality of girls&#8217; education in the school system. With regard to 
combating adult illiteracy, data from the 2011/2012 academic year showed that 52,747 
adults had participated in adult literacy programs, with women constituting 95 per cent of 
the participants. Similarly, the number of vocational training programmes for women had 
also been significant and during that academic year, 38 per cent of the 4,640 students 
enrolled were women.  
</p>
<p>27. The delegation stated that Eritrea continued to encourage the voluntary repatriation 
of persons who might have left the country illegally and in violation of the immigration 
laws, and that several rehabilitation and reintegration programmes for people returning on 
their own volition had been created. The Government was working to establish a 
mechanism to facilitate access to relevant international bodies, particularly the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, in accordance with recommendation 107 from 
the first UPR cycle.  
</p>
<p>28. The delegation provided information on the reorganization and restructuring of its 
structures, starting from the local level, in accordance with the motto, &#8220;political dynamism, 
effective management and organization&#8221;. The Government was focusing on activating the 
involvement of communities in managing their own affairs, with emphasis on local 
empowerment through greater devolution of authority to local governance and regional 
administrations.  
</p>
<p>29. The delegation stated that the political landscape respected fundamental freedoms, 
namely freedom of expression, association and religion. No one had been detained for 
expressing his or her views or ideas, including for criticizing government policies and 
actions; there had never been any restriction on accessing the Internet and religious 
harmony, mutual respect, mutual understanding of the religions continued to flourish.  </p>


<p>30. The delegation stated that Eritrea had submitted reports under the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child and the eight fundamental conventions of the International Labour 
Organization (ILO). The Government had responded to many questionnaires and letters 
from those monitoring bodies and had also responded positively to communications 
transmitted under the complaint procedure of the Human Rights Council, as well as directly 
to the Council during its twentieth and twenty-first sessions. Eritrea had attended all the 
regular sessions of the Council since the nineteenth session with the objective of working 
closely with the Council.  
</p>
<p>31. The delegation stated that Eritrea had been wrongly targeted with politically 
motivated resolutions of the Council that denigrated the ongoing efforts of the Government 
in promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms. Eritrea considered 
that country-specific resolutions did not serve the advancement of human rights and 
constituted a double standard and a deviation from the UPR process, which was a forum for 
constructive engagement.  
</p>
<p>32. The imposition of unjustified sanctions had negatively impacted the full enjoyment 
of human rights. Eritrea had been subjected to a litany of accusations of gross violations of 
human rights, while the facts on the ground illustrated that those accusations were invalid 
and were mainly motivated by sinister political agendas.  
</p>
<p>33. The sanctions imposed on Eritrea by the United Nations and the continued 
occupation of sovereign Eritrean territories entailed the prolongation of national service and 
other onerous burdens on the country and its people, which also deserved consideration. 
Unnecessary expenditure for defence as well as undesirable delays in some aspects of the 
political process were byproducts of that reality and it was in that respect that the continued 
occupation of its sovereign territories violated the right of the Eritrean people to live in 
peace. In that regard, the delegation called on the Council to give due regard in its agenda 
to the right of the Eritrean people to live in peace.  
</p>
<p>34. The delegation provided information on some of Eritrea&#8217;s best practices in the 
advancement of human rights, which included the community-based approach to addressing 
social problems, the approach to orphans and other vulnerable children with disabilities,  
provision of free education up to the tertiary level, charging of a nominal fee for health 
services up to referral treatment and the institution of the Injury Surveillance System. The 
country also observed United Nations recognized international days as occasions to 
promote public awareness on critical issues.

expressing his or her views and that media censorship was not practiced. Also, no journalist 
had been detained for performing his or her duty under the professional ethics of 
journalism.  
</p><p>86. Freedom of association was guaranteed under the Constitution and other laws, and 
various associations were working without any restrictions and with full freedom. Labour 
unions existed and the autonomy of trade unions was guaranteed under Labour 
Proclamation No. 118/2001. Eritrea had signed and ratified seven ILO conventions and it 
was duly submitting its reports in that regard.  
</p>
<p>87. The Government issued the 1995 Proclamation on religions and the 2002 
registration decree, requiring all religious organizations to register and declare their 
property. Some groups which refused to adhere to the law alleged that they have been 
persecuted.  </p>


<p>88. Following the criminalization of FGM, an intensive anti-FGM campaign had been 
conducted and yielded good results. Underage marriage was also criminalized. The 
Government followed a strict policy of zero tolerance to sexual violence.  
</p>
<p>89. The delegation stated that consensual same-sex sexual conduct was against the 
values and culture of Eritrean society.  
</p>
<p>90. The delegation stated that there was no arbitrary detention in Eritrea. National 
Service was not limited to military service and encompassed reconstruction and 
rehabilitation of the war-damaged country. The law strictly prohibited child soldiers and 
only persons 18 years of age and older did national service.  
</p>
<p>91. Trafficking in persons was a criminal act and Eritrea was cooperating with all 
concerned countries and agencies in that regard.  
</p>
<p>92. All the provisions enshrined in the Constitution, with the exception of those dealing 
with national election &#8212; for the obvious reason of the &#8220;no-war-no-peace situation&#8221;&#8212;, were 
strictly implemented and adhered to.  
</p>
<p>93. The so-called &#8220;G15&#8221;, who were high government officials, had been detained for 
treason and subversive acts committed at the time of war, when the very existence of the 
country was under threat. By those acts, they had abdicated their membership. The Eritrean 
National Assembly, at its 14th session, had discussed their cases and mandated the 
Government to handle the matter appropriately.  
</p>
<p>94. The delegation stated that the death penalty could serve as deterrent factor and had 
been used in very exceptional and limited cases.  
</p>
<p>95. The dossiers for ratification of CAT, CRPD, ICRMW and ILO Convention No. 182 
on the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour have been internally processed and 
were ready for approval and endorsement. Normally the process took some time to be 
reviewed by all the government institutions concerned and examined by the Ministry of 
Justice for harmonization with the other national laws. 
</p>
<p>96. The delegation stated that Eritrea endeavoured to submit its regular reports under the 
conventions and treaties that it had signed, and would consider requests for visits by Special 
Rapporteurs on a case-by-case basis, however, country-specific special procedures mandate 
holder did not promote human rights, but rather negated neutrality and objectivity. The 
appointment of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in  Eritrea was 
politically motivated and intended to undermine the UPR mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>97. Slovakia noted that further efforts were needed to address challenges to the 
freedoms of movement and expression. It called on Eritrea to cooperate fully with special 
procedures mandate holders and OHCHR to improve the human rights situation in the 
country.  
</p>
<p>98. Slovenia commended efforts to achieve the MDGs and noted the decrease in cases 
of FGM. It expressed concern at reports of rape and sexual harassment in military and 
educational training camps or during interrogation, domestic violence and harsh conditions 
in detention facilities. 
</p>

religious diversity and to work towards a lasting peace among all the people in the Horn of 
Africa.  
</p>
<p>100. South Sudan acknowledged progress in the field of education at all levels, 
particularly in school enrolment of girls. It noted that, despite progress made in combating 
FGM, it remained prevalent, and encouraged the Government to make further efforts.  </p>


<p>101. Spain was concerned at the human rights situation in Eritrea and at the lack of 
implementation of many of the recommendations from the previous UPR. It noted progress 
with regard to the right to safe drinking water and sanitation and in the area of child 
protection, but considered that there remained many shortcomings.  
</p>
<p>102. Sudan noted efforts to improve the rights of women, persons with disabilities and 
children, particularly the provision of assistance to orphan children and juveniles. It called 
upon the relevant bodies to provide the technical cooperation requested to improve human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>103. Sweden acknowledged progress on certain health-related MDGs, but noted that 
recommendations to improve political and civil rights had not been addressed. It was 
concerned about violations of freedom of speech and the press and that the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Eritrea had not been granted access to the 
country.  
</p>
<p>104. Germany deplored the lack of progress in the human rights situation since the first 
UPR cycle and noted that none of the accepted recommendations it had made had been 
implemented. It expressed deep concern at the continued forced labour of conscripts.  
</p>
<p>105. Thailand noted that challenges remained to the promotion of women&#8217;s rights, 
including protection from domestic violence and FGM. It noted the commitment to 
establish a standing committee to receive complaints of human rights violations and 
encouraged Eritrea to consider areas of cooperation with OHCHR.  
</p>
<p>106. Togo noted some progress in implementing the recommendations from the previous 
UPR, the adoption of programmes to provide assistance to orphans and street children, the 
provision of free compulsory education and the focus on education for girls.  
</p>
<p>107. Tunisia reaffirmed its support for the Eritrean people, the creation of a democratic 
State and respect of human rights. It noted the adoption of legislation to strengthen the 
judicial system, protect children&#8217;s rights and ensure gender equality.  
</p><p>108. Turkey considered that Eritrea&#8217;s invitation to the OHCHR should pave the way for 
further cooperation through technical support. It noted the emphasis on education for 
women and girls and the policy to eradicate FGM, as part of its efforts to achieve gender 
equality. 
</p>
<p>109. Uganda noted the programme for the economic empowerment of women, the 
Integrated Rural Development Schemes, the Nomadic Education Policy Framework, the 
establishment of vocational training schools, the provision of adult and lifelong education 
and the prohibition of FGM.  
</p>
<p>110. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland urged Eritrea to 
cooperate with the United Nations and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights in Eritrea. Regretting the lack of progress in the area of human rights, it hoped that 
concrete improvements would be forthcoming. Eritrea should fully implement its 
Constitution.  
</p>
<p>111. The United States of America urged Eritrea to promote human rights and 
fundamental freedoms and to invite the Special Rapporteur. It expressed concern that the 
Government did not prioritize civil and political rights and had not accounted for the 
disappearance of political prisoners. It noted the lack of democracy.  
</p>
<p>112. Uruguay encouraged Eritrea to redouble its efforts to implement all the 
recommendations, strengthen cooperation with the United Nations and strengthen efforts to 
incorporate international obligations into its new legislation. It recognized progress in the 
fight against FGM.  </p>


<p>113. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) noted the development of social investment 
programmes for more equal wealth distribution, which had improved health, food security 
and access to water and sanitation. It noted progress in basic and compulsory education.  
</p>
<p>114. Yemen noted suitable changes to the jurisdiction of the courts, the revision of 
procedures and legislation to ensure social justice, access to food security, health services, 
education and infrastructure, and other amendments to domestic legislation. 
</p>
<p>115. Afghanistan noted progress in the protection of children&#8217;s rights through the 
provision of free basic education and the prohibition of the engagement of minors in any 
occupation that endangered their physical and mental development, as well as measures for 
health protection. 
</p>
<p>116. Algeria considered that the ratification of certain international instruments would 
positively contribute to the human rights situation. It noted that efforts were needed to 
combat poverty and prevent violence, including FGM, and discrimination against women. 
Technical assistance would be required for Eritrea to fulfil its human rights obligations.  
</p>
<p>117. Argentina shared the concerns relating to the political, security, humanitarian and 
human rights situation in Eritrea, which were expressed in the latest resolution of the 
Human Rights Council on the human rights situation in Eritrea.  
</p>
<p>118. The delegation of Eritrea stated that the recommendation relating to the 2-per cent 
tax and the destabilization of the Horn of Africa was out of context. Eritrea is an active 
member that tries to promote peace and stability. It considered that the issue lacked a 
human-rights dimension and was abusive. In that connection, the delegation called upon the 
President of the Human Rights Council to strike the recommendation from the record.  
</p>
<p>119. Eritrea was committed to working with the Council on the advancement of human 
rights under the UPR mechanism. The delegation stated that the country-specific resolution 
on Eritrea was unjustified as it was initiated for political reasons to attain political 
objectives. In its view, that kind of approach undermined the UPR process. 
</p><p>120. Eritreans had fought long and hard and paid enormous sacrifices for their self-
determination. It was therefore fit and proper that the country&#8217;s priority should be ensuring 
peace and security, accelerating the development agenda and preserving the life and dignity 
of its people. The delegation called upon the Council to exercise its moral authority in 
lifting the sanctions and ending the occupation. Those were challenges that could not be 
taken lightly as they continued to impede the country&#8217;s efforts in the fulfilment of its human 
rights obligations.  
</p>
<p>121. The President of the Human Rights Council brought to the attention of the 
delegations the rules and procedures for the preparation of the reports of the Working 
Group, according to which those reports must be factual and must reflect the interventions 
made by the State under review and the delegations taking the floor. 
</p>
