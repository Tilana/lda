</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation stated that the first universal periodic review of Kazakhstan provided 
</p>
<p>an opportunity for the Government to assess its achievements and challenges in the 
</p>
<p>promotion and protection of human rights.  
</p>
<p>6. The national report of the second review, which provided information on the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the recommendations of the first review, was subject to broad 
</p>
<p>discussions with representatives of civil society and independent experts, before its 
</p>
<p>submission to the Human Rights Council. The advisory body, entitled &#8220;Dialogue Platform 
</p>
<p>on the Human Dimension&#8221;, comprised representatives of government agencies, civil 
</p>
<p>society, parliament and international organizations. It has been tasked with coordinating the 
</p>
<p>implementation of recommendations from the universal periodic review, from the mandate 
</p>
<p>holders of the special procedures of the Human Rights Council and from the human rights 
</p>
<p>treaty bodies. The Government adopted an action plan for effective implementation of the 
</p>
<p>recommendations of the first review and indicated that a similar approach would be utilized 
</p>
<p>for the implementation of recommendations received during the second review. 
</p>
<p>7. The delegation expressed Kazakhstan&#8217;s commitment to the promotion and protection 
</p>
<p>of human rights and fundamental freedoms, which have remained the highest priorities. </p>


<p>Sustainable development also remained a priority area in the country&#8217;s development. 
</p>
<p>Initiatives such as &#8220;Global Energy Strategy&#8221; and the &#8220;Green Bridge&#8221; partnership 
</p>
<p>programme aimed at achieving sustainable development. The main State priorities outlined 
</p>
<p>in the policy document &#8220;Strategy &#8211; 2050&#8221; called for progress toward durable democracy, 
</p>
<p>the rule of law and protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.  
</p>
<p>8. Kazakhstan has recorded substantive economic growth. The country&#8217;s gross 
</p>
<p>domestic product increased substantially and Kazakhstan has featured among the top five 
</p>
<p>fastest growing economies in 2013. This has enabled Kazakhstan to significantly increase 
</p>
<p>budget spending on education and health. 
</p>
<p>9. Kazakhstan has achieved the Millennium Development Goals on poverty reduction, 
</p>
<p>access to education and gender equality. The country has therefore adopted the agenda of 
</p>
<p>the &#8220;MDG +&#8221;, including advanced targets.  
</p>
<p>10. The protection of maternal and infant health remained an important national priority. 
</p>
<p>Efforts to improve related indicators contributed to the achievement of Goal 6 and a 
</p>
<p>reduction in HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis infection rates. The Government continued its 
</p>
<p>efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emission indicators in order to achieve Goal 7.  
</p>
<p>11. Due to progress in industrialization, Kazakhstan has achieved high levels of 
</p>
<p>employment with decent wages. The Government supported small and medium-sized 
</p>
<p>businesses. The National Chamber of Entrepreneurs was established in order to protect the 
</p>
<p>rights of businesses. Recently, a national concept of corporate social responsibility has been 
</p>
<p>in the process of discussion.  
</p>
<p>12. The delegation reported on measures undertaken to improve the population&#8217;s access 
</p>
<p>to public services, including through the use of information technology. Representatives of 
</p>
<p>civil society took part in various advisory and expert groups that worked to analyse and 
</p>
<p>practice the human rights legal framework. 
</p>
<p>13. The Government has been modernizing the national pension system. It also took 
</p>
<p>measures to ensure access to housing through various programmes. Programmes have also 
</p>
<p>been implemented to improve infrastructures, focusing primarily on access to drinking 
</p>
<p>water in rural areas.  
</p>
<p>14. The protection of the rights of persons with disabilities, especially children and 
</p>
<p>young people, remained an integral part of social policy. The Government has implemented 
</p>
<p>a national action plan to protect and improve quality of life for persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>The delegation noted the Government&#8217;s cooperation with civil society on various social 
</p>
<p>projects. The delegation also reported on work towards the creation of an Ombudsman for 
</p>
<p>the Rights of the Child.  
</p>
<p>15. The Government has revised its approaches to migration and made improvements in 
</p>
<p>the visa regime, including the introduction of visa-free travel for tourism and investment, to 
</p>
<p>attract foreign labour and capital.  
</p>
<p>16. The delegation noted some achievements made in ensuring inter-ethnic and 
</p>
<p>interreligious peace and harmony in the country and expressed its readiness to share 
</p>
<p>Kazakhstan&#8217;s experiences in establishing unique inter-ethnic and interfaith bodies, 
</p>
<p>including the &#8220;Assembly of People&#8221; and the &#8220;Congress of World Religions&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>17. The Government undertook the revision of a number of laws, including its Criminal 
</p>
<p>and Criminal Procedural Codes, in order to strengthen the rule of law and improve the 
</p>
<p>administration of justice. The revised Criminal Codes paid special attention to the broader 
</p>
<p>use of alternative measures to imprisonment and strengthened legal safeguards for persons 
</p>
<p>involved in criminal procedures. A law was adopted to ensure legal assistance by the State, 
</p>
<p>especially to persons belonging to vulnerable groups. An online database of domestic </p>


<p>legislation has been created to ensure free access to legal documents. The delegation noted 
</p>
<p>a number of measures taken to ensure better protection of persons&#8217; rights and liberty, 
</p>
<p>including continuous modernization of law-enforcement agencies.  
</p>
<p>18. The delegation provided responses to a number of advanced questions. Regarding 
</p>
<p>the death penalty, Kazakhstan has been firmly moving towards gradual abolition. Despite 
</p>
<p>the fact that Kazakhstan has not yet ratified the Second Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death 
</p>
<p>penalty (ICCPR-OP 2), the Government has followed international standards by declaring a 
</p>
<p>moratorium on the death penalty and by utilizing alternatives to life imprisonment.  
</p>
<p>19. In relation to the use of torture, the delegation stated that Kazakhstan has applied a 
</p>
<p>strict policy of zero tolerance. A national preventive mechanism has been established to 
</p>
<p>prevent torture based on the model of &#8220;Ombudsman +&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>20. The Government continued to pay special attention to combating trafficking in 
</p>
<p>human beings. With respect to visits of the special mandate holders of the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council, the delegation emphasized that, in 2009, Kazakhstan issued a standing invitation 
</p>
<p>to all special mandate holders.  
</p>
<p>21. Domestic legislation was reformed to bring it into line with the 1951 Convention 
</p>
<p>relating to the Status of Refugees. Therefore, stateless persons have been entitled to the 
</p>
<p>right to work in Kazakhstan. The law prohibited the expulsion of refugees and asylum 
</p>
<p>seekers in the case of threats to life and freedom.  
</p>
<p>22. The delegation expressed the Government&#8217;s commitment to continue its work 
</p>
<p>towards further improvement of national legislation and practice in human rights, taking 
</p>
<p>into account international standards and commitments. The Government acknowledged that 
</p>
<p>building democracy and the rule of law requires continuous efforts and progressive 
</p>
<p>realization. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review

</p>
<p>made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>

</p>
<p>26. Cuba noted Kazakhstan&#8217;s efforts to address unemployment, especially among young

</p>
<p>27. The Czech Republic commended the legislative reforms relating to Kazakhstan&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>first UPR. However, it regretted that many of the recommendations it had accepted during

<p>the review had not yet been fully implemented. The Czech Republic made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>28. Djibouti noted with satisfaction the Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy, which was a new

<p>29. Egypt commended efforts to ensure equal access to employment and education and 
</p>
<p>the political process for all ethnicities and faiths. It invited the delegation to outline its best 
</p>
<p>practices regarding diversity in schools. Egypt made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>30. Estonia noted Kazakhstan&#8217;s steps to reform its legislation and judicial system to 
</p>
<p>implement the recommendations of the first review. However, many of those 
</p>
<p>recommendations remained unfulfilled. It encouraged Kazakhstan to ease restrictions on 
</p>
<p>civil society, avoid penalizing non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that received 
</p>
<p>foreign funding and strengthen measures to combat violence against women and children. 
</p>
<p>Estonia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>31. Ethiopia noted with satisfaction Kazakhstan&#8217;s efforts to achieve universal enrolment, 
</p>
<p>protect women and children against violence, increase women&#8217;s political representation, 
</p>
<p>combat human trafficking and counter terrorism. It noted Kazakhstan&#8217;s road map for 
</p>
<p>transitioning to a &#8220;green economy&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>32. Finland was concerned about the deterioration of freedom of expression and asked

</p>
<p>expression for all. Finland made recommendations.  
</p>

</p>
<p>operational, what resources were available to it and whether its activities were driven by 
</p>
<p>targets. France made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34. Germany noted with appreciation Kazakhstan&#8217;s efforts to improve human rights and 
</p>
<p>commended its interreligious dialogue and cooperation with international organizations. 
</p>
<p>However, some issues remained of concern. Germany made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. Hungary commended Kazakhstan&#8217;s almost universal enrolment in primary and 
</p>
<p>secondary education but was concerned that migrant and refugee children were often 
</p>
<p>excluded from education. Despite several UPR recommendations, libel remained a 
</p>
<p>punishable offence under the new criminal law. It welcomed the plan of action on the rights 
</p>
<p>of persons with disabilities. Hungary made recommendations.

</p>
<p>human trafficking. Iraq made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>40. Ireland encouraged Kazakhstan to seek to attain top-level status for its national 
</p>
<p>human rights institutions. It hoped that the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
</p>
<p>rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly 
</p>
<p>and of association would visit the country. Ireland made recommendations. 
</p>

<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. Japan encouraged Kazakhstan to continue its efforts to promote the rule of law by

<p>corruption and torture and ill-treatment by law enforcement agencies. Japan made

</p>
<p>a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>47. Latvia welcomed amendments to legislative acts to prevent domestic violence, 
</p>

<p>Principles). It commended the national plan on human trafficking, the advancement of 
</p>

</p>
<p>51. Maldives encouraged Kazakhstan to create safe havens for victims of domestic 
</p>
<p>violence. It commended the adoption of the national plans to support persons with 
</p>

</p>
<p>52. Montenegro noted that women were underrepresented in political life and asked 
</p>
<p>about measures to eliminate stereotypes regarding women and men roles. It enquired about 
</p>
<p>plans to complete the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
</p>
<p>Disabilities (CRPD). Montenegro made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>53. The Netherlands remained concerned about limited implementation of previous UPR 
</p>
<p>recommendations. It noted that the treatment of so-called &#8220;non-traditional&#8221; religious groups 
</p>
<p>had deteriorated and fell short of international standards. The Netherlands made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. </p>


<p>54. Norway commended efforts to reform the prison system and the adoption of a 
</p>
<p>national preventive mechanism against torture. It expressed concern about deterioration of 
</p>
<p>freedom of speech, particularly restrictions on independent media and further 
</p>
<p>criminalization of libel. Norway made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. Pakistan welcomed efforts to promote gender equality, especially in public life, and 
</p>

</p>
<p>commitment to the prevention of tuberculosis. Pakistan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>56. The Philippines acknowledged efforts to provide high-quality health care for all, and 
</p>
<p>progress in achieving universal primary and secondary education and in combating 
</p>
<p>domestic violence. It welcomed the adoption of the national plan on human trafficking. It 
</p>
<p>made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>57. The delegation noted that no one religion dominated in Kazakhstan, that religions 
</p>
<p>were not separated as being either traditional or non-traditional and that all religions 
</p>
<p>received equal treatment and protection under the law. The registration process for religious 
</p>
<p>groups was simple and the Act on Religious Activities and Religious Associations 
</p>
<p>complied with international standards and did not infringe on the rights of any faith. 
</p>
<p>Following the 2014 visit by the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, who 
</p>
<p>had taken positive note of the regulation of religious activities, consultations were being 
</p>
<p>held with experts on amendments to the Religious Activities Act. 
</p>
<p>58. The delegation stated that Kazakhstan was party to various instruments to protect 
</p>
<p>children&#8217;s rights. Legislation provided protection, in particular to vulnerable children, while 
</p>
<p>an inter-agency system protected neglected children from violence and ill-treatment. A 
</p>
<p>Committee for the Protection of Children&#8217;s Rights supported the inter-agency provision of 
</p>
<p>social, medical, legal and other services for children. The new Criminal Code established 
</p>
<p>criminal liability for the sexual or economic exploitation of children, kidnapping or 
</p>
<p>trafficking of children and for violence perpetrated against children. A lifetime ban on 
</p>
<p>working with children was imposed on persons who had been convicted of sexual offences 
</p>
<p>against children. Kazakhstan had achieved Goal 2 on achieving universal primary 
</p>
<p>education. Furthermore, it enjoyed high levels of literacy and had launched a State 
</p>
<p>programme to develop education that would ensure high quality instruction throughout the 
</p>
<p>country. The children of immigrants enjoyed the same rights to secondary, technical and 
</p>
<p>tertiary education as Kazakh citizens. Levels of female participation in education were 
</p>
<p>high, with gender parity visible throughout the education system and high numbers of 
</p>
<p>female teachers in secondary schools. 
</p>
<p>59. The delegation stated that the new Criminal Code was intended to increase public 
</p>
<p>confidence in the justice system, extend the powers of the court and reduce the prison 
</p>
<p>population. New categories for offences should serve to prevent crime and two new 
</p>
<p>chapters provided for medical crimes and computer-related crimes. Persons convicted of 
</p>
<p>corruption were banned from holding official State positions. Alternative measures to 
</p>
<p>deprivation of liberty were emphasized, while the penalties for dangerous crimes had been 
</p>
<p>toughened.  
</p>
<p>60. Regarding the questions on defamation, the delegation stated that a defamation case 
</p>
<p>could only be launched at the request of a citizen. Although defamation was addressed by 
</p>
<p>the Criminal Code, proceedings were akin to civil cases and the public prosecutor played no 
</p>
<p>role in such cases. The process of launching a case had been simplified, in order to protect 
</p>
<p>citizen&#8217;s rights and guarantee that cases could be dealt with more quickly and thoroughly.  
</p>
<p>61. The rights and responsibilities of detainees were read aloud to them on arrest and 
</p>
<p>evidence obtained from a person whose detention had not complied with procedures was 
</p>
<p>inadmissible. Cooperation and plea deals had been introduced, along with various 
</p>
<p>limitations on criminal proceedings. Citizens&#8217; rights and freedoms were protected by two-</p>


<p>step judicial monitoring and all the measures introduced complied with the international 
</p>
<p>and domestic obligations of Kazakhstan. Appeals could be made against decisions by the 
</p>
<p>prosecutor and some of the prosecutor&#8217;s authority had been transferred to the court under 
</p>
<p>the new Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>62. At present, the Government was considering the ratification of CRPD and efforts 
</p>
<p>were under way to provide for persons with disabilities, particularly with regard to 
</p>
<p>improving access to services and transport and fostering a positive approach to persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities in society. National policies ensured the provision of modern medical assistance 
</p>
<p>and free aid and rehabilitation was available to victims of radiation from the Semipalatinsk 
</p>
<p>nuclear test zone, as well as other social benefits and compensation.  
</p>
<p>63. The Trade Unions Act of 2014 clearly indicated the organization of the trade union 
</p>
<p>movement and increased its role in protecting workers&#8217; rights and interests. Trade unions 
</p>
<p>could be formed without prior authorization and local trade unions could join together to 
</p>
<p>form an organization. 
</p>
<p>64. Kazakhstan enjoyed a wide range of media outlets, the majority of which were not 
</p>
<p>operated by the State. Digital broadcasting was being introduced and satellite broadcasts 
</p>
<p>were available throughout the country. Internet access was being expanded and the State 
</p>

</p>
<p>framework for democratic freedoms. Many peaceful assemblies had taken place in the past

</p>

</p>
<p>109. The delegation stated that a national preventive mechanism on torture had been

<p>social workers. Persons working for the national preventive mechanism enjoyed unlimited 
</p>
<p>access to a wide range of places of detention and the mechanism had been allocated

<p>Institutions. The Human Rights Commissioner worked directly with the human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms of the United Nations and the Council of Europe, and a number of NGOs, 
</p>
<p>including Human Rights Watch. Work to bring the mechanism into line with the Paris 
</p>
<p>Principles is set to continue, taking into account the recommendations put forward by 
</p>
<p>delegations during the review. 
</p>

</p>
<p>particular focus was given to inclusive education, and the State programme to develop the 
</p>
<p>education system included targets for establishing zones of inclusive education. Children 
</p>

</p>
<p>regardless of gender, studied the same curriculum and all children studied a course called 
</p>
<p>self-knowledge that focused on society&#8217;s values, the role of the family and questions of 
</p>
<p>gender.  
</p>

</p>
<p>including farm work, and criminal liability for using child labour had been tightened. 
</p>
<p>113. The appreciation of justice system reform expressed by delegations was welcomed. 
</p>
<p>The justice system was based on the principles of judicial independence, equality before the 
</p>
<p>law and the presumption of innocence. In 2013, the World Economic Forum had noted 
</p>
<p>improvements to the justice system of Kazakhstan, notably the competitive selection of 
</p>
<p>judges and the transparent and accessible system, which used modern technology and 
</p>
<p>provided for alternative dispute resolution. The new Code of Criminal Procedure 
</p>
<p>strengthened the role of the court in protecting human rights and the role of the defendant in 
</p>
<p>legal proceedings. International standards had been introduced on the training and 
</p>
<p>qualifications of judges. 
</p>
<p>114. Kazakhstan noted an influx of foreigners and efficiency of administrative measures 
</p>
<p>on their support and further development, as well as favourable steps taken to attract

</p>
<p>non-visa regime with the aim of investment and tourism for civilians of some countries.  
</p>
<p>115. Kazakhstan has continuously made reforms of the penitentiary system aimed at 
</p>
<p>bringing it into line with international standards. Detainees enjoyed in practice all rights 
</p>
<p>enshrined in the constitutional and domestic legislation. Various measures were specified, 
</p>
<p>including alignment of facilities with international standards, including improvements to 
</p>
<p>medical services, and revised food standards for persons who remain in custody, especially 
</p>
<p>women, children and persons with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>116. The delegation emphasized various measures taken to address and prevent domestic 
</p>
<p>violence, including the adoption of preventive laws, the establishment of State-supported 
</p>
<p>crisis centres and a dedicated hotline. Regarding measures related to sexual exploitation of 
</p>
<p>minors, Kazakhstan specified an ongoing commitment to improve legislation and 
</p>
<p>strengthen provisions, and cited an increase to the age of criminal liability. The delegation 
</p>
<p>noted several preventive measures to combat human trafficking and cited recommendations 
</p>
<p>by the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and its 
</p>
<p>consequences, which have been included in a draft of the Government&#8217;s Plan for the period 
</p>
<p>of 2015-2017.  
</p>
<p>117. The delegation highlighted several policies and programmes implemented to 
</p>
<p>improve the access to health care of mothers and children. The Government took measures </p>


<p>to reduce infant mortality rate/s over the past five years and to achieve the goal of making 
</p>
<p>available full reproductive health services by 2015. Concerning migrant workers, 
</p>

</p>
<p>workers.

<p>in gender policy and reaffirmed Kazakhstan&#8217;s commitment to implement its obligations 
</p>
<p>under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 
</p>
<p>and other relevant international polices. In reference to early marriages, the delegation 
</p>
<p>noted clear prohibitions under the legislation as well as criminal sanctions in cases of 
</p>
<p>abduction and forced marriages.  
</p>
<p>119. In relation to the ratification of (ICCPR-OP 2), the delegation noted the associated 
</p>
<p>financial obligations and stated that the accession to the Protocol would be considered when 
</p>
<p>those obligations could be realistically achieved. 
</p>
<p>120. The delegation noted that there were many recommendations regarding criminal 
</p>
<p>laws. Kazakhstan adopted entirely new approaches in the new Criminal and Criminal 
</p>
<p>Procedure Codes, which will come into force in January 2015. Therefore, during the 
</p>
<p>follow-up period of the review, Kazakhstan will be able to report about its achievements in 
</p>
<p>this area. 
</p>
<p>121. Regarding the ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, 
</p>
<p>the delegation noted the current legal practices and lengthy procedures of the Court. 
</p>
<p>Kazakhstan would follow the developments of the Court before making a decision to join it.  
</p>
<p>122. Kazakhstan referenced two forthcoming mandate holder visits by the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association and by the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on the implications for human rights of the environmentally sound 
</p>
<p>management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. The delegation recalled that

</p>
