Financial and Operating Report
FINANCIAL AND CORPORATE REVIEW
AngloGold Ashanti delivered a solid operating and financial performance for the first half of 2016, continuing to execute on its strategy 
to improve cash flows and returns on a sustainable basis and to develop  optionality within the business. The results show improved 
earnings and free cash flow given strong ongoing focus on cost and capital discipline, and the rising gold price.
“We  will  continue  to  push  hard  to  improve  operational  and  cost  performance,  as  well  as  our  overall  balance  sheet  flexibility, 
regardless  of  the  gold  price  environment,” Chief  Executive  Officer  Srinivasan  Venkatakrishnan  said.  “Our  focus  remains  to  improve 
margins and grow cash flow and returns on a sustainable basis.” 
 
Production was 1.745Moz at a total cash cost  of $706/oz for the six months to 30 June 2016, compared to 1.878Moz at $726/oz in the 
first  six  months  of  2015,  from  continuing  operations.  The  decrease  in  production  from  continuing  operations  was  led  by  weaker 
production from Kibali and a planned decrease in head grades at Tropicana, as noted earlier in the year. AISC improved by $13/oz 
over  the  first  half  of  last  year,  decreasing  from  $924/oz  to  $911/oz.  The  improvement  in  AISC  reflects  continued  cost  discipline 
throughout  the  group,  weaker  currencies  and  lower  capital  expenditure.  Our  portfolio  of  assets  continued  to  deliver  strong  and 
consistent performance as a whole. 
 
Free  cash  flow  of  $108m  was  recorded  for  the  half  year,  more  than  triple  the  $31m  for  the  first  half  of  2015,  resulting  in  3 
consecutive quarters of free cash flow generation.  Free cash flow was affected by negative working capital movements which will 
unwind in the second half  of the year, specifically  $28m from the sale  of metal from Argentina  which  was delayed  until the  week 
immediately following half year.  
 
This overall improvement in free cash flow, however, was driven by continued efforts to contain costs and improve efficiencies, weaker 
currencies in key operating jurisdictions, $33m in interest savings, and a 1% higher gold price received.   
 
Cash inflow from operating activities decreased by $37m, or 7%, from $513m in the six months ended 30 June 2015 to $476m in the 
six  months  ended  30  June  2016,  reflecting  a  7%  drop  in  production  from  continuing  operations  and  negative  working  capital 
movements, which included timing of gold shipments from Argentina, and movements in VAT receivables in South Africa. 
 
AHE were $159m, or 39 cents per share, compared with $61m, or 15 cents, in the first half of 2015. Net profit attributable to equity 
shareholders during the first half of 2016 was $52m compared with a net loss from continuing operations of $23m a year earlier. During 
the six months ended 30 June 2016, AngloGold Ashanti settled foreign denominated debt resulting in a recycling of historic foreign 
exchange losses of $60m from the Foreign Currency Translation Reserve to the Income Statement. This was added back for headline 
earnings. In addition, the effective tax rate reduced from 113% to 46% as the tax charges decreased from $115m in the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to $51m in the six months ended 30 June 2016. This was largely due to the currency impact on the translation of 
the deferred tax balance in South America.  
 
Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (adjusted EBITDA) decreased by 12m, or 2% from $793m in the 
six month period ended 30 June 2015 to $781m in the six months ended 30 June 2016. The lower production year-on-year was largely 
offset by cost improvements over the same period. The ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA at the end of June 2016 was 1.44 times, 
compared with the 1.47 times recorded at the end March 2016, and 1.95 times  at the end of June 2015, highlighting the success of 
AngloGold Ashanti’s continued efforts to deleverage and sustain improvements in cash flow. 
 
Net  debt  fell  by  32%  to  $2.098bn,  from  $3.076bn  at  the  end  of  June  2015,  mainly as a result of  the proceeds received on the sale 
of Cripple Creek & Victor (CC&V) for $819m which was concluded last year, as well as continued  strong  cost  management,  which 
saw improvements across most cost areas. 
 
The balance sheet remains robust, with strong liquidity comprising $1.0bn available on the US dollar revolving credit facility (RCF) at 
the end of June 2016, A$190m undrawn on the A$500m Australian dollar RCF, approximately R3.2bn available from the South African 
RCF and other facilities and cash and cash equivalents of $470m as at the end of June 2016. 
 
This strong liquidity position allowed AngloGold Ashanti to draw down $330m from the US dollar RCF at the end of July to partially fund 
the redemption of the $503m outstanding in 8.5% bonds due in 2020. The remainder was funded by cash on hand. The redemption 
was executed on 1 August 2016 at a predetermined price of 106.375 cents on the dollar, thereby eliminating the company’s highest-
cost  debt,  and  reducing  both  interest  payments  and  the  concentration  of  debt  maturities  in  2020,  improving  free  cash  flow  and 
introducing additional balance-sheet flexibility by reducing the company’s hardened debt levels. This will reduce interest charges by 
$40m on an annualised basis.  
 
The  South  African  operations  reported  a  3%  drop  in  production  year-on-year  to  486,000oz,  alongside  a  13%  improvement  in 
AISC which declined to $958/oz, from  $1,098/oz in the same period last year.  Mponeng delivered the standout  performance in the 
region,  with  a  25%  increase  in  production  and  a 28%  decrease  in  AISC  year-on-year.  However,  whilst  the  weaker  rand  benefitted 
costs, production continued to  be  hampered  by  increased  safety-related  stoppages  which  have  become  a  feature  of  the  country’s 
underground  mining  industry. The  frequent  and  unpredictable  nature  of  Section  54  stoppages  and  mass  compliance  audits  by  the 
Department of Mineral Resources has created an element of risk to production levels from the region, given the resultant downtime and 
production ramp-up periods. 
 
The  International  operations  delivered  production  of  1.259Moz  at  an  AISC  of  $873/oz,  compared  with  1.378Moz  at  an  AISC  of 
$840/oz  in  the  same  period  last  year.  These  mines,  all  outside  South  Africa,  accounted  for  72%  of  AngloGold  Ashanti’s  total 
production, and benefited from weaker currencies in Argentina, Australia and Brazil. There were especially strong cost performances 
from  Sunrise Dam and  Cerro  Vanguardia,  which  posted significant  efficiency gains  during the first half of 2016. As  indicated  at the 
beginning  of  the  year,  production  was  lower  in  accordance  with  the  plans  at  Geita  and  Tropicana,  whilst  Kibali  continued  to  face 
challenges encountered in mining and processing different ore types, and the first attempt during the first quarter to test the transition to 
a sulphide processing circuit.
Capital  expenditure  (including  equity  accounted  entities)  was  $318m  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2016  compared  to  $426m 
(including  discontinued  operations)  in  the  same  period  last  year.  This  reduction  was  partially  due  to  favourable  exchange  rate 
movements,  impediments  in  reaching  investment  targets  caused  by  ongoing  safety stoppages  in  South  Africa,  and  the  cessation  of 
work on the underground decline access at Obuasi in Ghana. It is expected that capital expenditure will increase in the second half of 
the year in line with past trends.

SAFETY UPDATE 
 
The all injury frequency rate (AIFR), the broadest measure of workplace safety, was 8.03 per million hours worked in the first half, 
from 7.51  in  the  same  period  last  year,  a  7%  regression  mainly  due  to  the  South  Africa  region,  while  the  International  operations 
recorded AIFR at 2.19, a 31% improvement from 3.17 reported last year. Regrettably, there were three fatalities in this period, a fall of 
ground  fatal  in  TauTona  and  two  fatalities  which  occurred  in  seismic  events  at  the  Savuka  section  of  TauTona,  with  the  largest 
measuring 3.5 on the Richter scale. 
 
In  South  Africa,  work  on  the  execution  of  the  Safe  Production  Strategy  which  focuses  on  improving  skills,  behaviour  and 
attitude, planning work and protecting workers from risk continues. As a result, Moab Khotsong managed to achieve one million fatality 
free  shifts  on  10  May  2016,  Mponeng  achieved  one  million  fatality  free  shifts  during  the  first  quarter  of  the  year,  whilst  Kopanang 
achieved one million fatality free shifts on 14 June 2016 as well as one-year fatality-free on 1 July 2016. 
 
The safe management of mobile equipment remains a key focus area across the International operations, especially in the Continental 
Africa region. Training programmes aimed at improving competence of equipment operators and supervisors are being implemented to 
reduce the risks associated with mobile equipment. High potential incident audits are conducted regularly to mitigate safety challenges 
across the group, which include fall of ground and heavy mobile equipment incidents. 
 
OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS 
 
The South  African operations produced 486,000oz at a total cash cost of $809/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared 
to 500,000oz at a total cash cost of $894/oz in the same period last year. Safety stoppages resulted in approximately 44,085oz of lost 
production, given the downtime and resultant ramp-up period.  Costs  benefitted  from  the  weaker  exchange  rate  despite  these  lower 
production volumes, inflationary pressures on labour and power, and the court-ordered re-instatement of the 542 employees dismissed 
in 2013. 
 
At  West  Wits,  production  was  214,000oz  at  a  total  cash  cost  of  $786/oz  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2016  compared  to 
207,000oz at  a  total  cash  cost of  $910/oz  in  the  same  period  last  year.  Production  was  affected  by  the  fall-of-ground  incident  in 
January  at  TauTona,  and  a  seismic-related  fatal  accident  at  the  Savuka  section  of  the  same  mine  in  April.  Both  incidents  led  to 
prolonged stoppages,  impacting negatively on production and development. Work is underway to revise the production plan to further 
improve  access to  working  areas.  This  was  more  than  offset  by  the  strong  production  performance  from  Mponeng,  which  showed 
recovery from  the safety- related production interruptions encountered in  the six months ended 30 June 2015.  Mponeng  was  one of 
the  lowest  cost  producers  for  the  South  African  region  in  the  first  half  of  2016  at  a  total  cash  cost  of  $692/oz  reflecting  an 
improvement of 25% year-on-year. 
 
Vaal River production was 173,000oz at a total cash cost of $843/oz for the six months ended June 2016, compared to 191,000oz at a 
total cash cost of $861/oz in the same period last  year. Production was  negatively impacted by safety-related stoppages,  with Moab 
Khotsong most affected.
Production at Surface Operations was 93,000oz at a total cash cost of $797/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2016, compared to 
97,000oz at a total cash cost of $925/oz in the same period last year. The most significant impact on production was a decline in 
yield  from  the  reclamation  of  the  lower  grade  Tailings  Storage  Facilities  at  the  West  Wits  section.  The  Vaal  River  section  saw 
improved  grades  from  the  success  of  the  screening  initiative  to  upgrade  the  Kopanang  marginal  ore  dumps.    Production  at  Mine 
Waste Solutions improved as a result of an improved reclamation strategy and from the commissioning of the East Pump Station in 
the  third  quarter  of  2015.  The  flotation  plant  was  recommissioned  in  June  and  it  is  expected  that  the  Uranium  plant  will  be  fully 
operational during the third quarter of this year, which is expected to result in improved gold and uranium recovery. 
 
In the  Continental  Africa region, production was 620,000oz at a total cash cost of $690/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2016 
compared to 719,000oz at a total cash cost of $675/oz in the same period last year.  Costs were impacted by overall low production 
volumes,  despite  strong  ongoing  cost  control.  Production  was  affected  by  the  planned  lower  production  from  Geita,  a 
disappointing performance from Kibali, and the cessation of tailings retreatment at Obuasi. 
 
In the  Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo, Kibali’s  production was  114,000oz at a  total cash cost  of  $802/oz for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 compared to 148,000oz at a total cash cost of $588/oz in the same period last year. The lower production was 
due  to  lower  throughput,  recovery  and  grade  while  the  operation  manages  the  complexity  of  several  different  surface  and 
underground ore types. Ahead of commissioning of the shaft in the second half of 2017 and an increase in the proportion of sulphide 
ore,  a  plant  trial  was  undertaken  on  100%  sulphide.  The  trial  highlighted  a  number  of  areas  where  improvements  will  be 
needed  including  fine grinding and  sulphide  concentrate leaching.   To  provide improved  flexibility two  high -grade satellite pits  are 
being  developed  in  the  current  year  and  in  2017.    Development  of  the  underground  mine  is  progressing  on  schedule  with  shaft 
equipping completed, and off- shaft development and integration with the decline system in progress. 
 
In Ghana, Iduapriem’s production increased 13% to 99,000oz at a total cash cost of $931/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2016, 
compared to 88,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,037/oz in the same period last year. The production improvement was driven by a 6% 
higher  recovered  grade  as  well  as  a  6%  increase  in  tonnage  treated  as  a  result  of  improved  plant  utilisation  compared  to  the 
same  period  last  year  when  throughput  was  impacted  by  an  extensive  plant  shutdown.  Total  cash  costs  consequently  decreased 
mainly a s a result of higher production together with the once-off benefit of a reversal of contractor mining costs for the settlement of 
historical claims with the previous mining contractor. 
 
At Obuasi, the first  half of  2016 has  been dominated by the incursion of illegal miners onto the operating area.  Despite extensive 
engagements with the authorities at all levels to re-establish law and order, illegal miners continue to occupy the lease area. The mine 
has been placed on care and maintenance,  with only essential dewatering,  ventilation and water treatment activities  being underta 
ken. Meanwhile, future options for recommencing operations continue to be evaluated. 
 
At  Siguiri  in  Guinea,  production was  126,000oz  at  a  total  cash cost  of  $706/oz for  the  six months ended 30  June  2016  compared 
to 132,000oz  at  a  total  cash  cost  of  $837/oz  in  the  same  period  last  year.  Production  was  lower  due  to  a  planned  7%  decrease 
in recovered grade, partly compensated by a 2% increase in tonnage throughput given the increased plant availability. Total cash costs 
were  lower  as  a  result  of  weaker  currency  exchange  rates,  lower  fuel  prices,  a  once-off  benefit  of  a  reversal  of  the  contractor 
mining costs for the settlement of historical claims with the previous mining contractor, and favourable ore stockpile movements. 
 
In  Mali,  Morila’s  production  was  13,000oz  at  a  total  cash  cost  of  $965/oz  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2016  compared  to 
35,000oz at  a  total cash cost  of $569/oz in  the  same period last year.  Production decreased as  the  operation transitions  to  end -of- 
life, treating marginal and tailings grade. 
 
At Sadiola, production was 36,000oz at a total cash cost of $826/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared to 36,000oz at 
a total cash cost  of  $840/oz in the same  period last  year. Production was maintained,  while  total cash cost  decreased due to  lower 
fuel prices and good cost management. 
 
In Tanzania, Geita  produced  229,000oz  at  a  total  cash  cost  of  $496/oz  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2016  compared  to 
250,000oz  at  a  total  cash  cost  of  $487/oz  in  the  same  period  last  year.  Production  decreased  as  a  result  of  a  planned  11% 
reduction  in  recovered grade from  mining  lower  grade  ore  in  the  Nyankanga  pit  compared  to  the  same  period  last  year.  This  was 
partly  compensated  for by  a  3% increase in plant throughput as a result of consistent plant operations. The focus for Geita over the 
next few quarters will be toward improving mining efficiencies in the new underground development and step-up productivity to planned 
levels. 
 
In  the  Americas,  production  was  388,000oz  at  a  total  cash  cost  of  $549/oz  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2016  compared 
to 377,000oz at a total cash cost of $632/oz in the same period last year. The AISC at $816/oz compared to $849/oz this period last 
year, were  due  to  good cost controls,  weaker  exchange rates, and higher  by-product  sales  in Argentina,  partially  tempered by high 
inflation, particularly in Brazil. 
 
In  Argentina, Cerro  Vanguardia  produced  136,000oz  at a  total  cash  cost of  $543/oz  for  the  six  months ended  30  June  2016 
compared to 135,000oz at a total cash cost of $641/oz in the same period last year. Total cash costs were 15% lower than in the same 
period  last  year, helped by the local currency devaluation and a 35% increase in by-product sales of silver.   These were partially  offset 
by inflationary  pressures  which  included  initial  salary  increases  following  a  wage  settlement  reached  in  February.  It is  expected 
that  a second round of negotiations will take place early in the second half of the year. Unfavourable stockpile movements resulted 
from  lower tonnes mined during a short, unprocedural strike in January. Free cash flow for the six months ended 30 June 2016 was 
negatively impacted due to a delay in the receipt of cash from gold and silver sales of $28m. 
 
In Brazil, production was 252,000oz at a total cash cost of $545/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared to 242,000oz a 
total cash cost of $627/oz in the same period last year. AISC were $857/oz compared to $816/oz for same period last year. The lower 
costs reflect higher capital expenditure partially offset by higher gold sold, lower operating expenditure and favourable exchange rates 
in the current period. 
 
At AngloGold Ashanti Mineração, production was 188,000oz at a total cash cost of $531/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2016 
compared to 181,000oz at a total cash cost of $598/oz in the same period last year. Production increased due to higher tonnage at 
both the Cuiabá and Córrego do Sítio complexes together with higher grades from the latter. The improvement was due to increased 
developed reserves at the beginning of the year at Cuiabá, in addition to better operational performance at both the mine and plant 
in  the Córrego do Sítio complex.  Production  at  the  Cuiabá  complex  was  slightly  affected,  where  access  to  higher  grade  areas  -
some as high as 20g/t - was delayed due to geotechnical issues. However, changes in the mining plan have already been made and it 
is expected that production will improve in the second half of the year. Total cash costs were 11% lower compared to same period last 
year mainly due to higher production, continued cost saving initiatives and the weaker currency, partially offset by higher inflation. 
 
At  Serra  Grande  production  was  64,000oz  at  a  total  cash  cost  at  $584/oz  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2016  compared  to 
61,000oz at a total cash cost of $714/oz in the same period last year. Production increased as a result of higher recovered grade and 
tonnage treated, reflecting operational improvements in the plant. Total cash costs were 18% lower due to higher gold produced, cost 
saving initiatives from labour and primary development credits, and local currency devaluation, partially impacted by higher inflationary 
impacts including power costs. Drilling ahead of our retreat mining development has revealed areas in the Minas III ore body where 
mineralised  material  extends  significantly  further  than  anticipated.  This  will  result  in  a  longer-than-anticipated  development  period, 
compensated for with additional ounces in the production profile. We are working on improving this outcome in future by looki ng at 
augmenting existing exploration budgets. 
 
In Australia,  production  was  251,000oz  at  a  total  cash  cost  of  $806/oz  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2016  compared  to 
282,000oz at  a  total cash cost of  $703/oz  in the same period  last  year.  Production  was  down  despite  better mill  throughput  due to 
lower  grades at both operations. A plant optimisation and upgrade project at Tropicana to lift throughput to 7.5 Mtpa is expected to be 
completed by the end of September. 
 
Production  at  Sunrise  Dam  was  113,000oz  at  a  total  cash  cost  of  $858/oz  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2016  compared 
to 115,000oz at a total cash cost of $958/oz in the same period last year. Production was impacted by lower grades and marginally 
lower  metallurgical  recovery,  despite  a  6%  increase in mill throughput.  Total  cash costs  decreased with  the impact of  lower  grades 
more  than  offset  by  favourable ore stockpile  movements together  with good cost controls.   The  efficiencies   were   derived   from 
reduced  mining, processing and maintenance costs  and reduced underground mining costs,  whereby the cost  per tonne mined was 
11%  lower than in the same period last year when there was a higher ore stock drawdown. Ore production at Sunrise Dam has now 
increased to an annualised rate of 2.8 Mt, almost doubling underground volumes since 2012, and continuing to displace mill-feed 
from low-grade stockpiles with higher-grade underground material. 
 
At  Tropicana,  production  was  137,000oz  at  a  total  cash  cost  of  $704/oz  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2016,  compared  to 
167,000oz  at  a  total  cash  cost  of  $476/oz  in  the  same  period  last  year.  Production  was  lower  due  to  the  planned  end  to  grade 
streaming in December 2015, which meant the head grade was 27% lower in the first half of 2016 compared to the corresponding 
period in 2015. Total cash costs increased compared to the same period last year, primarily due to lower production and inventory 
movement, with 19% more ore mined. The plant optimisation project remains on schedule for completion in September and the plant 
achieved a record throughput rate of 7.28 Mtpa in May and June. The Long Island Study, which has been considering innovative, low 
cost  approaches  to  mining  the  depth  extensions  of  the  Tropicana  mineralised  system,  has  advanced,  supported  by  extensive 
drilling.  An  updated  Ore  Reserve  and Mineral Resource estimate is expected at the end of the year and the study is expected to be 
completed in the first half of 2017. 
 
PERSONNEL 
 
A number of key personnel changes have been made across our operations. These changes highlight the strength and depth of our 
internal talent pool, an area on which we have spent considerable time, expertise and resources over the past several years. These 
changes are also consistent with our commitment to timeous succession planning in all roles across the business. 
 
Ludwig  Eybers,  who  has  been  with  the  company  for  five  years,  and  has  led  the  remarkable  turnaround  of  our  Continental  Africa 
portfolio since 2013, has been appointed Deputy Chief Operating Officer: International. Ludwig, who has had extensive experience 
working  across  a  number  of  international  jurisdictions  over  a  20-year  career,  has  overseen  an  increase  in  productivity  for  the 
Continental Africa region, along with  an improvement in safety. He will work closely with Ron Largent on budgeting and business 
planning, as well as on the execution of Operational Excellence initiatives. 
 
Ludwig  replaces Helcio Guerra,  who has  decided, for  personal reasons, to take  early  retirement  at the end  of  December,  after  a 
distinguished mining career of almost four decades, the past eight  years of which were spent with AngloGold Ashanti. Helcio was 
most  recently  the  Deputy  COO:  International  following  his  position  as  Senior  Vice  President:  Americas.  Helcio  has  been  a  key 
member of our operational management team and contributed to the transformation of the International Portfolio over the past three 
years in particular.  He has mentored a world-class team in Argentina and Brazil, and leaves behind a suite of assets with an exciting 
range of future options for AngloGold Ashanti. We wish him all the best in his well-deserved retirement. 
 
Sicelo Ntuli, who has for the past three years led the turnaround of the Iduapriem mine in Ghana, where costs have  decreased, will 
replace Ludwig as Senior Vice President: Continental Africa. Sicelo, a mining  engineer, has extensive operating experience across 
the group’s open pit and deep underground assets, as well as in business planning and strategy roles over his career for more than 
20 years spent with AngloGold Ashanti. He will work closely with Ludwig as he transitions into his new role. (Sicelo will be replaced 
at Iduapriem by Jasper Musadaidzwa, currently the operations manager at Siguiri Mine). 
 
Lowe  Billingsley,  Vice  President  of  Planning  and  Strategy,  in  the  International  business  unit,  will  assume  the  role  of  Senior  Vice 
President: Americas. In his most recent post he had oversight of strategy implementation and long-range planning for the Americas 
portfolio.  Lowe  is  a  trained  geologist  who  has  also  held  several  important  posts  during  his  26  years  with  the  company,  including 
General Manager of the Cripple Creek & Victor Mine during its successful mine-life extension project. He will work closely with Helcio 
as he transitions into his new role. 
 
Moses Madondo, general manager of the Moab Khotsong mine, will assume a broader suite of responsibilities as he assumes his 
new role of Senior Vice President of the Vaal River Region in South Africa. Moses, a mining engineer who has extensive experience 
spanning strategy, planning and operations, will continue to work closely with Chris Sheppard, COO: South Africa, and his executive 
management team in South Africa, as they continue their work to safely improve productivity in the region. 
 
UPDATE ON CAPITAL PROJECTS 
 
At  Mponeng,  in  Phase  1:  126  level,  the  implementation  of  the  secondary  support  strategy  continued  to  produce  positive  results 
during the second quarter.  The ore handling infrastructure at  126 level,  which includes  the sinking of  reef  and waste silos,  remains 
ahead of schedule. This project is scheduled for completion in July 2018.
In Phase 2, critical execution activities continued, including the construction of the surface substation which was completed during 
the  second  quarter,  which  is  now  awaiting  commissioning  from  Eskom,  along  with  the  continuation  of  equipping  the  ice  pipe  and 
other  associated  activities.    The  balance  of  Phase  2  is  scheduled  to  commence  in  January  2018  and  a  pre-feasibility  is  being 
conducted on the Carbon Leader ore body extension. 
 
At  Kibali,  remedial  work  on  the  Ambarau  hydro  power  station  was  completed,  following  the  river  flood  event  in  November  2015. 
Construction is back on track, and commissioning is scheduled for the end of 2016. Early works have commenced on the third hydro-
power station at Azambi. 
 
At  Siguiri,  AngloGold  Ashanti  plans  to  invest  about  $115m  over  a  little  over  two  years  to  add  a  hard-rock  plant  to  the  current 
processing infrastructure, providing the ability to develop the significant sulphide-ore potential that exists on the current concession. 
during the first half of the year the company reached an agreement with the Government of Guinea on the Convention de Base, a 
legal  and  fiscal  framework  covering  the  life  of  the  project.  The  accord  will  now  progress  through  the  mandatory  legal  and 
parliamentary ratification processes. 
 
At  Sadiola,  AngloGold  Ashanti  and  joint-venture  partner  IAMGOLD  Corporation  are  completing  a  final  optimisation  of  the  Sadiola 
Sulphides Project, ahead of an investment decision later this year. The project, to add sulphide-ore processing capability to the plant, 
was  suspended  in  2013  after  the  precipitous  decline  in  the  gold  price  that  year. Whilst  the  technical  and  financial  aspects  of  the 
optimised project look promising, it is important that the Government of Mali – itself an owner of a 18% stake in the mine  – provide 
assurances around the renewal of the construction and operating permits, power agreement and fiscal terms relating to the project, 
as previously negotiated, before an investment commitment can be made. The early timing of these assurances and renewals from 
the Government are especially important in order for the upgraded plant to be fully operational before all existing sources of oxide ore 
are depleted. The project aims to significantly extend the life of the project, with increased production and lower operating costs from 
the current levels. 
 
Colombia remains an area of long-term focus for us, particularly given its attractive and under-explored geological potential, AngloGold 
Ashanti’s first-mover advantage in the country and its significant exploration success to date. Whilst bearing in mind that we remain in 
an environment in which financial resources are constrained, we have committed to completing the update of the pre-feasibility studies 
for the Gramalote and La Colosa projects by the end of next year. We anticipate that the successful completion of these studies will 
enable the declaration of reserves to take place. 
 
Technology and Innovation update  
 
1.           Reef Boring 
 
1.1         Small range: 
 
Commisioning of the Sandvik/Cubex machine commenced at Savuka Mine earlier in the quarter with operational readiness having 
been the key focus during this period. Training of operators will continue during the third quarter with the first cycle of operational test 
results expected soon thereafter. 
 
1.2          Medium Range: 
 
With a blue print cycle time of 72 hours/hole, the 3 MK III machines in the Carbon Leader site at TauTona mine have drilled a total of 
16 holes during the quarter.  Overall performace for the quarter has improved to just over 82 hours/hole as opposed to the previous 
quarters  performance  of  96  hours/hole.  As  is  the  case  with  the  MK  IV  machine,  machine  availability/reliability  is  an  issue,  but  is 
receiving attention. As planned, an additional MK III machine was successfully commissioned in the VCR site during the quarter. 
 
The MK IV machine has for the second consecutive quarter performed at just above the 92 hour/hole mark. Key issues affecting the 
performance  remain  rock  handling  and  more  importantly  machine  availability  where  dedicated  resources  have  been  deployed  to 
assist in resolving these issues. 
 
All  sites  were  affected  by  mine  wide  safety  stoppages  as  well  as  a  geotechnical  incidence  resulting  in  the  total  number  of  holes 
completed being lower than planned for the quarter. 
 
2.      Ore body Knowledge and Exploration 
 
The first prototype drill rig was delivered to TauTona mine during the quarter and after a number of surface commisioning challenges 
were resolved, was moved into position at the drill site late in the second quarter. Underground commissioning will commence early 
in the third quarter, upon which our first prototype machine tests will commence focussing on deflection optimisation trials. 
 
3.     Ultra High Strength Backfill (UHSB) 
 
Construction of the surface solution plant at TauTona mine is still ongoing and on schedule. 
 
Site development for the permanent UHSB plant at Savuka mine has been delayed due to safety stoppages. However, in the interim 
period,  the  temporary  plant  has  been  used  to  fill  all  the  drilled  holes  allowing  testing  of  the  small  range  reef  boring  machine  to 
continue. 
 
Designs  for  the  TauTona  Below  120  (B120)  plant  has  been  finalised. The  tendering  process  will  commence  in  quarter  three  and 
construction is planned to commence in the fourth quarter.   
 
GREENFIELDS 
 
During  the  first  half  of  the  year,  Greenfields  exploration  activities  were  undertaken  in  Australia,  Colombia,  Brazil,  Argentina, 
USA,  Guinea  and  Tanzania.  The  Greenfields  exploration  team  completed  1,219m  of  diamond  drilling  in  Colombia  and  14,016m  of 
aircore drilling in Australia. Total expenditure for the six months ended 30 June 2016 was $10m.
In Australia, at the Tropicana Mine there was a formal hand-over to the mine-based team of the accountability for all tenements within 
60kms of  the mine.  Further  to  the  south in  the  Tropicana  joint-venture  on  the  Oak  Dam  tenement,  the  Greenfields  team  continued 
to  work  with  the traditional  owners  to  determine  where  access  for  exploration  would  be  allowed.   In  the  Laverton  District,  aircore 
drilling was completed over  priority  targets  with  91  holes  drilled  for  a  total  of  5,742m.  At  the  Strawbridge  Project  (100%  AngloGold 
Ashanti)  the  field  work comprised  geological  mapping,  surface  soil  geochemical  sampling  and  first  pass  aircore  drilling.  A  total  of 
778 soil samples  and 197 aircore holes for 8,274m were completed over priority target areas. 
 
In  Colombia, drilling  was  completed  at  the  Guintar  project  (100%  AngloGold Ashanti) situated 40km west  of  Medellin.  Three holes 
for 1,219m  were completed in the first half of the year. Final  compilation and review recommended that no further work is required. 
Work  has  now  shifted  to  the  Margaritas  project  area  2kms  to  the  south  where  mapping,  rock  and  soil  geochemistry  has  been 
completed. Reconnaissance work was conducted in other locations within Antioquia province in the mid-Cauca belt. 
 
Generative  exploration  occurred  in  Brazil,  Argentina,  USA,  Guinea  and  Tanzania. In  a  significant  development, the  Greenfields 
exploration  team  signed  a  new  farm-in  and  joint-venture  agreement  with  Luna  Gold  to  explore  approximately  2,000km2  tenement 
package  located  in  the  Maranhão  state  of  Brazil.  In  Tanzania  the  Meia  license  applications  (850  km2)  in  the  Lake  Victoria 
Greenstone  Belt  of Tanzania are pending and should be granted in the third quarter. The first phase of exploration was completed at 
the Niandan license in Guinea (100km2, 90km from Siguiri) and 491 surface samples were collected.  Early stage work is progressing 
in Argentina and the USA. 
 
BROWNFIELDS  
 
During  the  first  half  of  the  year,  Brownfields  exploration  activities  were  undertaken  across  the  globe.  Brownfields  exploration, 
including  equity  accounted  joint-ventures,  completed  285,877m  of  diamond  drilling  at  a  total  expenditure  for  the  six  months  ended  
30 June 2016 of which $27m was capitalised and $33m was expensed. 
 
South  Africa:  The  mother  hole  of  borehole  UD59  successfully  intersected  a  1.82m  thick  VCR  reef  at  3,888m  below  surface  on  
11  April.  Borehole  UD60  reached  3,345m  (284m  drilled  during  the  half)  and  continued  to  experience  in-hole  complications. 
Borehole  UD58A completed piloting to a depth of 3,027m. The final establishment of the ultra-deep derrick has been completed and 
drilling commenced. 
 
Tanzania:  At  Geita,  drilling  activities  included  infill  drilling  at  Nyankanga  Cut  9  (Block  5  UG),  Nyankanga  Cut  8,  Star  &  Comet  Cut 
3, Geita Hill East  Cut  2,  and Mineral Resource delineation drilling at Star &  Comet UG and Geita Hill East UG. A  total  of  10,372m 
was drilled, comprising 4,392m reverse circulation (RC) and 5,980m diamond drilling (DD). 
 
Guinea:    At  Siguri,  a  total  of  29,415m  was  drilled.  Exploration  drilling  included  infill  and  reconnaissance  drilling  at  Bidini  North, 
Bidini  South,  Soloni,  Kalamagna  PB2,  Seguelen  PB2,  Seguelen  satellite  pit,  Silakoro,  Kami  ‘starter  pit’,  Balato  NE  and  sterilisation 
drilling  at  Boukaria.  Additionally,  exploration  supported  the  drilling  of  12,893m  allocated  to  Advance  Grade  Control  within  the  Kami 
starter pit. 
 
Ghana: At Iduapriem, on the Bankyem/Block 1E target, the remaining trenches from 2015 exploration were sampled early in the first 
quarter. A total of 1,597m drilling was completed over the target, comprising 421m RC and 1,176m DD. At Block 4S, 2,456m drilling 
was completed, including 501m RC and 1,955m DD, with some encouraging assay results returned. Within the southern area at Block 
7&8, a total of 796m were drilled during the quarter with some encouraging results. The programme is ongoing. 
 
Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo:  At  Kibali,  exploration  focused  on  Kombokolo,  the  Agbarabo-Rhino-Pakaka  corridor,  Tete 
Bakangwe,  Sessenge  SW  and  the  KCD  super  pit.    The  forecast  production  shortfall  has  resulted  in  an  emphasis  on  projects 
with  potential  to  deliver  oxide  ounces  to  the  plant  in  the  relatively  short  term.  Regional  targets  explored  include  Aindi  Watsa, 
Memekazi Ridge and Zambula. A total of 7,953m was drilled near mine and 3,519m was drilled on regional targets. 
Republic  of  Mali  –  At  Sadiola  and  Yatela,  RC  drilling  totaling  11,716m  was  completed  during  the  first  half  of  the  year.  Drilling 
focused on Sadiola North/FN (4,624m), FE2S (5,454m) and FE1W (1,638m). 
 
In Argentina, drilling commenced at Cerro Vanguardia during Q2 after a delayed start with most of the drilling meters completed at the 
nearby Claudia joint-venture.  During the second quarter 4,174m were drilled in total, including 3,618m at the Claudia joint-venture. 
 
In Brazil, exploration continued at the Cuiabá, Lamego and Córrego di Sítio production centers for AGABM with 61,221m drilled during 
the quarter from the combined surface and underground drilling programmes. 
 
At Serra Grande, 36,295m were drilled as part of the exploration and Mineral Resource conversion programmes. Surface exploration 
continued as preparation to establish drilling targets. 
 
In Colombia, the Gramalote joint-venture completed 1,279m of drilling to support site and infrastructure investigations as well as infill 
drilling to better define the saprolite horizon. At La Colosa, 1,453m were drilled as the site investigation geotechnical drilling continued. 
The Quebradona JV programme did not complete drilling during the half year and was focused on study work. 
 
In Australia, at Sunrise Dam drilling targeted Vogue South, Vogue Deeps, north extensions to Cosmo and Cosmo East, Carey Shear, 
Below Carey high grade zone and Ulu Steeps for a total of 28,758m. 
 
At  Tropicana,  a  100m  x  100m  exploration  drilling  programme  continues  to  test  the  along-strike  and  down  dip  extensions  of  the 
Tropicana gold system to provide data for the Long Island Mining Study. Infill drilling was also carried out on the Havana South high 
grade zone identified during the June quarter. A total of 16,670m of RC and 34,695m of DD drilling was completed in the first half of 
2016. A Mineral Resource model update is in progress. 
 
A  new  regional  exploration  group  was  set-up  based  at  Tropicana  to  manage  the  TJV  exploration  tenements  (excluding  the  mine 
lease). In the first half of the year, regional exploration consisted of drilling and a ground-based geophysical survey. Aircore, RC and 
DD totalled 13,360m. 
 
The regional dataset review and a large amount of regional structural re-interpretation work to aid targeting has been completed with a 
number of areas identified as being potentially prospective. A large number of these will be systematically targeted.

OBUASI UPDATE  
 
In early February 2016, following the incursion of hundreds of illegal miners inside the fenced area of the Obuasi mine site, AngloGold 
Ashanti Ghana was forced to declare force majeure and, in the interests of safety, withdrew all employees performing non-essential 
functions. Until then, work had been underway to investigate the viability of investing in the redevelopment of the mine as a modern, 
productive and long-life mining operation. 
 
Since then, the remaining employees have been performing critical services related to the operation of underground water pumping, 
environmental and potable water treatment, provision of medical services, and maintenance of facilities that provide power and water 
to employees’ homes and surrounding communities. 
 
In its declaration of force majeure, AngloGold Ashanti Ghana explained that the current situation is precluding it from fulfilling certain 
conditions of its Amended Programme of Mining Operations, which was agreed with the government in November 2014. In particular, 
the presence of illegal miners on the mine’s operational footprint, in its underground tunnels and in areas which host key infrastructure 
at the mine is impacting directly on the company’s ability to continue to perform even the most essential services. 
 
Given inaction by the authorities with respect to bringing an end to the invasion and illegal occupation of the site, illegal mining has 
continued to grow since the initial invasion and the miners are now estimated to number several thousand who work on the site on any 
given day. Whilst there has been no impact on AngloGold Ashanti’s production and all-in sustaining costs as the site was not forecast 
to be in production for at least this year, the damage to  the  site  infrastructure  and  ore  body  will  have  a  direct  impact  on  the  mine’s 
future viability. 
 
AngloGold Ashanti Ghana filed a Request for Arbitration against the Government of Ghana with the International Centre for Settlement 
of  Investment  Disputes  (ICSID)  on  8  April  2016.  The  case  was  registered  on  2  May  2016.  ICSID  is  an  international  arbitration 
institution, headquartered in Washington, D.C., which facilitates dispute resolution between international investors and host states. The 
relevant authorities’ in Ghana, including the Attorney General, have been duly notified of the commencement of proceedings. 
 
On 3 June 2016, the company also asked ICSID to make an urgent order compelling the Government of Ghana to use its authority to, 
among other things,  reinstate military security and restore law and order to the Obuasi  Mine for the protection of AngloGold Ashanti 
Ghana’s personnel and the preservation of AngloGold Ashanti Ghana’s assets.  
 
Discussions are ongoing with Ghanaian authorities in respect of their request to our local subsidiary, made after the end of the second 
quarter, to post an additional bond of $150m by 31 August 2016 in respect of its environmental obligations at Obuasi Mine. The present 
value of these obligations has already been provided for in the financial statements.  
 
MINERAL RESERVES AND RESOURCES STATEMENT 
 
There have been no material changes to the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimates as disclosed in the 2015 Ore Reserve 
and Mineral Resource report. 
 
OUTLOOK 
 
The production guidance provided to the market for the 2016 full year remains unchanged. Gold production for the year is estimated 
to be between 3.6Moz to 3.8Moz. Estimated total cash costs are expected to remain between $680/oz and $720/oz whilst AISC are 
expected to remain between $900/oz and $960/oz at average exchange rates of ZAR14.97/$, BRL3.51/$, $0.74/A$ and AP15.10/$, 
and Brent Crude Oil at $42/bl average for the year. Capital expenditure for the full year is still expected to be between $790m and 
$850m. 
 
Both  production  and  cost  estimates  assume  neither  labour  interruptions,  power  disruptions  or  changes  to  asset  portfolio  and/or 
operating mines. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on our future results. Outlook data 
is forward-looking information which is further discussed on the front cover of this document.

Independent  auditor’s  review  report  on  the Condensed  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for the  six  months ended 
30 June 2016 to the Shareholders of AngloGold Ashanti Limited
We have reviewed the condensed consolidated financial statements of AngloGold Ashanti Limited (the company) contained in 
the accompanying interim report on pages 11 to 24, which comprise the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of 
financial  position  as  at  30  June  2016,  the  condensed  consolidated  income  statement,  statement  of  comprehensive  income, 
statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the six months then ended, and selected explanatory notes.  
Directors’ Responsibility for the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
The  directors  are  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  presentation  of  these  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  in 
accordance  with  the  International  Financial  Reporting  Standard,  IAS  34  Interim  Financial  Reporting  as  issued  by  the 
International  Accounting  Standards  Board  (IASB),  the  SAICA  Financial  Reporting  Guides,  as  issued  by  the  Accounting 
Practices Committee and Financial Reporting Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council, and 
the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error.  
Auditor’s Responsibility 
Our  responsibility  is  to  express  a  conclusion  on these  interim  financial statements  based  on  our  review. We  conducted  our 
review  in  accordance  with  International  Standard  on  Review  Engagements  (ISRE)  2410,  Review  of  Interim  Financial 
Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity. This standard requires us to conclude whether anything has 
come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim financial statements are not prepared in all material respects in 
accordance  with  the  applicable  financial  reporting framework.  This standard  also  requires  us  to comply  with  relevant  ethical 
requirements.  
A  review  of  interim  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  ISRE  2410  is  a  limited  assurance  engagement.    We  perform 
procedures, primarily consisting of making enquiries of management and others within the entity, as appropriate, and applying 
analytical procedures and evaluating the evidence obtained.   
The  procedures  performed  in  a  review  are  substantially  less  than  and  differ  in  nature  from  those  performed  in  an  audit 
conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing.  Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on these 
financial statements. 
Conclusion 
Based  on  our  review,  nothing  has  come  to  our  attention  that  causes  us  to  believe  that  the  accompanying  condensed 
consolidated financial  statements  of  the company for the  six  months  ended  30 June  2016  are  not prepared,  in  all material 
respects, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standard, IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting  as issued by the 
IASB,  the  SAICA  Financial  Reporting  Guides  as  issued  by  the  Accounting  Practices  Committee  and  Financial  Reporting 
Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and the requirements of the Companies Act of South 
Africa.

Includes the group’s attributable share of capital commitments relating to associates and joint ventures.
(1)
Liquidity and capital resources
To  service  the  above  capital  commitments  and  other  operational  requirements,  the  group  is  dependent  on  existing  cash 
resources, cash generated from operations and borrowing facilities.  
 
Cash generated from operations is subject to operational, market and other risks. Distributions from operations may be subject to 
foreign investment, exchange control laws and regulations and the quantity of foreign exchange available in offshore countries. In 
addition, distributions from joint ventures are subject to the relevant board approval. 
 
The credit facilities and other finance arrangements contain financial covenants and other similar undertakings. To the extent that 
external borrowings are required, the group’s covenant performance indicates that existing financing facilities will be available to 
meet the above commitments. To the extent that any of the financing facilities mature in the near future, the group believes that 
sufficient measures are in place to ensure that these facilities can be refinanced.
14.  Financial risk management activities
Borrowings 
The $1.25bn bonds are carried at fair value. The rated bonds are carried at amortised cost and their fair values are their closing 
market  values  at  the  reporting  date  which  results  in  the  difference  noted  in  the  table  below.  The  interest  rate  on  the  remaining 
borrowings  is  reset  on  a  short-term  floating  rate  basis  and  accordingly  the  carrying  amount  is  considered  to  approximate  the  fair 
value.

Derivatives 
The  fair  value  of  derivatives  is  estimated  based  on  ruling  market  prices,  volatilities,  interest  rates  and  credit  risk  and  includes  all 
derivatives carried in the statement of financial position. 
Embedded derivatives are included as derivatives on the statement of financial position. 
The group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments: 
Level 1: 
Level 2:
quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
inputs  other  than  quoted  prices  included  in  level  1  that  are  observable  for  the  asset  or  liability,  either  directly 
(as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); and 
inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

On  28  June  2016,  AngloGold  Ashanti  (“AGA”)  announced  that  its  wholly  owned  subsidiary,  AngloGold  Ashanti  Holdings  plc 
(“AGAH”),  is  compelling  the  surrender  following  the  notice  to  buy  back  the  remaining  principal  amount  of  its  outstanding  8.5% 
high-yield bonds that mature in May 2020, as part of its strategy to reduce debt and lower finance charges.  On 1 August 2016, 
the remaining portion of the notes  were settled for a total consideration of $503m consisting of a $471m principal payment, a 
surrender premium of $30m and interest of $2m.
On 24 August 2015, AngloGold Ashanti announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, AngloGold Ashanti Holdings plc, was offering 
to buy back up to $810m in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 8.5% high-yield bonds that mature in 2020, as part of its 
strategy  to  reduce  debt  and  lower  interest  payment.    On  25  September  2015,  62.34%  of  the  notes  were  settled  for  a  total 
consideration of $850m consisting of a $779m principal payment, a tender premium, being the difference between the par value of 
the bond and the redemption price of $58m and interest of US$13m.  Included in the tender premium on the $1.25bn bond (note 
5) was a realised fair value loss of $11.5m being the difference between the fair value on redemption date and the redemption 
price.
Environmental obligations
Pursuant  to  environmental  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  operate,  we  are  obligated  to  close  our  operations  and 
rehabilitate the lands which we mine in accordance with these regulations. As a consequence AngloGold Ashanti is required in 
some  circumstances  to  provide  either  reclamations  bonds  issued  by  third  party  entities,  establish  independent  trust  funds  or 
provide  guarantees  issued  by  the  operation,  to  the  respective  environmental  protection  agency  or  such  other  government 
department  with  responsibility  for  environmental  oversight  in  the  respective  country  to  cover  the  potential  environmental 
rehabilitation obligation in specified amounts.
In  most  cases,  the  environmental  obligations  will  expire  on  completion  of  the  rehabilitation  although  in  some  cases  we  are 
required to potentially post bonds for events unknown that may arise after the rehabilitation has been completed.
In  South  Africa  we  have  established  a  trust  fund  which  has  assets  of  ZAR  1.33bn  and  guarantees  of  ZAR  1.37bn  issued  by 
various  banks,  for  a  current  carrying  value  of  the  liability  of  ZAR  1.4bn.  In  Australia,  since  2014,  we  have  paid  into  a  Mine 
Rehabilitation Fund an amount of AUD $1m for a current carrying value of the liability of AUD $95.3m. At Iduapriem we have 
provided  a  bond  comprising  of  a  cash  component  of  $9.7m  with  a  further  bond  guarantee  amounting  to  $33.9m  issued  by 
Ecobank Ghana Limited (expired on 31st May 2016 but renewal process is underway) for a current carrying value of the liability of 
$43.8m. At Obuasi we have provided a bond comprising of a cash component of $20.1m with a further bank guarantee amounting 
to $30m issued by Nedbank Limited for a current carrying value of the liability of $218.1m. In some circumstances we may be 
required to post further bonds in due course which will have a consequential income statement charge for the fees charged by the 
providers of the reclamation bonds.

(1)   Occupational Diseases in Mines and Works Act (ODMWA) litigation - On 3 March 2011, in Mankayi vs. AngloGold Ashanti, 
the Constitutional Court of South Africa held that section 35(1) of the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases 
Act,  1993  does  not  cover  an  “employee”  who  qualifies  for  compensation  in  respect  of  “compensable  diseases”  under the 
Occupational Diseases in Mines and Works Act, 1973 (ODMWA). This judgement allows such qualifying employee to pursue 
a  civil  claim for  damages  against  the  employer.  Following  the  Constitutional  Court  decision, AngloGold  Ashanti  has  been 
subject  to  numerous  claims  relating  to  silicosis  and  other  Occupational  Lung  Diseases  (OLD),  including  several  potential 
class actions and individual claims. 
In November 2014, Anglo American South Africa, AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields Limited, Harmony Gold Mining Company 
Limited and Sibanye Gold Limited formed an industry working group on OLD to address issues relating to compensation and 
medical care for occupational lung disease in the gold mining industry in South Africa.  The working group now also includes 
African Rainbow Minerals (ARM).  The companies believe that fairness and sustainability are crucial elements of any solution 
and have embarked on an extensive engagement process with all stakeholders to work together to design and implement a 
comprehensive  solution  that  is  both  fair  to  past,  present  and  future  gold  mining  employees,  and  also  sustainable  for  the 
sector. 
The companies are among respondent companies in a number of lawsuits related to OLD. The companies do not believe 
that  they  are  liable  in  respect  of  the  claims  brought,  and  they  are  defending  these.  They  do,  however,  believe  that  they 
should work together to seek a solution to this South African mining industry legacy issue. 
The  companies  active  in  gold mining  have  been  working  for many  years  to  try  to  eliminate  the  incidence  of  OLD.  These 
efforts continue. 
These legal proceedings are being defended, and the status of the proceedings are set forth below. 
AngloGold Ashanti, along with other mining companies including Anglo American South Africa,  ARM, Gold Fields Limited, 
Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited, DRDGold Limited, Randgold and Exploration Company Limited, and Sibanye Gold 
Limited, were served with a consolidated class action application on 21 August 2013. On 13 May, 2016, the South Gauteng 
High Court of South Africa ruled in favour of the applicants and found that there were sufficient common issues to certify two 
industry-wide  classes:  a  Silicosis  Class  and  a  Tuberculosis  Class,  each  of  which  cover  current  and  former  underground 
mineworkers who worked in South African mines from 12 March, 1965 and who have contracted the respective diseases (or 
the  dependents  of  mineworkers  who  died  of  those  diseases).    The  High  Court  ordered  a  two-stage  process  in  the  class 
action.  The  first stage  is  to  resolve  common  issues  and  allow  the  individuals  to  opt  out.  The second  stage  will  allow  the 
individuals to opt in to the class to make their claims against the respondent mining companies.  The High Court also decided 
that claims for general damages (i.e., pain and suffering and loss of amenities of life) will be transferable to the estate or 
executor  of  any  deceased  mineworker  who  dies  after  the  date  of  filing  of  the  certification  application.    On  3  June  2016, 
AngloGold Ashanti, together with certain of the other mining companies, filed an application with the High Court for leave to 
appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal. Arguments in the application for leave to appeal were heard on 23 June 2016. On 24 
June 2016, leave to appeal was (i) granted in respect of the issue of the transferability of deceased mineworkers' claims for 
general damages but (ii) denied in respect of all other orders of the High Court. On 15 July 2016 AngloGold Ashanti, along 
with several other respondent companies, filed a petition with the Supreme Court of Appeal for leave to appeal such other 
orders of the High Court. 
 
It is possible that additional class actions and/or individual claims relating to silicosis and/or other OLD will be filed against 
AngloGold  Ashanti  in  the  future.  AngloGold  Ashanti  will  defend  all  current  and  subsequently  filed  claims  on  their  merits. 
Should  AngloGold  Ashanti  be  unsuccessful  in  defending  any  such  claims,  or  in  otherwise  favourably  resolving  perceived 
deficiencies in the national occupational disease compensation framework that were identified in the earlier decision by the 
Constitutional Court, such matters would have an adverse effect on its financial position, which could be material. Given the 
inherent legal and factual uncertainties with respect to the pending claims and other claims not yet filed against the company, 
no reliable estimate can be made for the obligation. 
 
Litigation - On 11 October 2011, AngloGold Ashanti (Ghana) Limited (AGAG) terminated Mining and Building Contractors 
Limited’s  (MBC)  underground  development  agreement,  construction  on  bulkheads  agreement  and  diamond  drilling 
agreement  at  Obuasi  mine.  The  parties  reached  agreement  on  the  terms  of  the  separation  and  concluded  a  separation 
agreement on 8 November 2012.  On 20 February 2014, AGAG was served with  a writ issued by MBC claiming a total of 
$97m.  In  December  2015,  the  proceedings  were  stayed  in  the  High  Court  pending  arbitration.    In  February  2016,  MBC 
submitted the matter to arbitration.

(3)
Litigation - AGAG received a summons on 2 April 2013 from Abdul Waliyu and 152 others in which the plaintiffs allege that 
they were or are residents of the Obuasi municipality or its suburbs and that their health has been adversely affected by 
emission  and/or  other  environmental  impacts  arising  in  connection  with  the  current  and/or  historical  operations  of  the 
Pompora  Treatment  Plant  (PTP),  which  was  decommissioned  in  2000.  The  plaintiffs’  alleged  injuries  include  respiratory 
infections, skin diseases and certain cancers.  The plaintiffs subsequently did not timely file their application for directions, 
but AGAG intends to allow some time to pass prior to applying to have the matter struck out for want of prosecution.  On  
24 February 2014, executive members of the PTP (AGAG) Smoke Effect Association (PASEA), sued AGAG by themselves 
and on behalf of their members (undisclosed number) on grounds similar to those discussed above, as well as economic 
hardships as a result of constant failure of their crops. This matter is set for hearing in October 2016. In view of the limitation 
of current information for the accurate estimation of a liability, no reliable estimate can  be made for  AGAG’s  obligation  in 
either matter.
(4)   Mill contractor claims - On 3 August 2015, AngloGold Ashanti and Newmont concluded the sale of the Cripple Creek & Victor 
mine  in  Colorado  to  Newmont.   As  part  of  the  negotiated  transaction,  the  parties  agreed  to  a  cost/recovery  sharing 
arrangement relative to cost claims asserted for or against CC&V based on work performed by contractors during the design 
and manufacture of the High Grade Mill.  Under the agreement, AngloGold Ashanti has the right to manage any negotiation, 
settlement, or legal proceedings associated with each cost claim.  The total value of the cost claims asserted against CC&V, 
by  two  contractors,  is  $20m.  On  1  April  2016,  CC&V  was  added  as  a  defendant  to  a  lawsuit  in  the  U.S.  District  Court 
(Colorado) between one of the contractors and a subcontractor,  and the cost claims are being litigated there. Separately, 
CC&V has cost claims against the mill design contractor. These claims are proceeding in arbitration.
With reference to items (1) - (4) above, provisions have been raised where the amount of the potential claim or settlement 
can be reasonably estimated.
Tax claims
(5)   Other tax disputes - In November 2007, the Departamento Nacional de Produção Mineral (DNPM), a Brazilian federal mining 
authority,  issued  a  tax  assessment  against  AngloGold  Ashanti  Brazil  Mineração  Ltda  (AABM)  in  the  amount  of  $14m  
(2015: $11m) relating to the calculation and payment by AABM of the financial contribution on mining exploitation (CFEM) in 
the period from 1991 to 2006. The matter has been dormant since 2007. AngloGold Ashanti Limited’s subsidiaries in Brazil 
are involved in various other disputes with tax authorities. These disputes involve federal tax assessments including income 
tax,  royalties,  social  contributions  and  annual  property  tax.  The  amount  involved  is  approximately  $14m  (2015:  $11m). 
Management is of the opinion that these taxes are not payable.
(6)   VAT disputes - Mineração Serra Grande S.A. (MSG) received a tax assessment in October 2003 from the State of Minas 
Gerais  related  to  VAT  on  gold  bullion  transfers.  The  tax  administrators  rejected  the  company’s  appeals  against  the 
assessment.  The  company  is  now  appealing  the  dismissal  of  the  case  to  the  State  of  Minas  Gerais.  The  assessment  is 
approximately $13m (2015: $11m).
(7)   Tax dispute - In January 2013, AngloGold Ashanti Colombia S.A. (AGAC) received notice from the Colombian Tax Office 
(DIAN)  that  it  disagreed  with  the  company’s tax  treatment  of  certain  items  in the  2010  and  2011  income  tax  returns.  On  
23 October 2013, AGAC received the official assessments from the DIAN which established that an estimated additional tax 
of  $22m  (2015: $20m)  will  be  payable  if  the  tax  returns  are  amended.  Penalties  and  interest  for  the  additional  taxes  are 
expected to be $119m (2015: $108m). The company believes that the DIAN has applied the tax legislation incorrectly. AGAC 
subsequently challenged the DIAN’s ruling by filing lawsuits in March 2015 and April 2015 before the Administrative Tribunal 
of Cundinamarca (trial court for tax litigation). On 8 July 2016, the tribunal held an initial procedural hearing on the 2010 tax 
dispute.
(8)   Tax  dispute  -  On  12  July  2013,  Cerro  Vanguardia  S.A.  (CVSA)  received  a  notification  from  the  Argentina  Tax  Authority 
(AFIP) requesting corrections to the 2007, 2008 and 2009 income tax returns of about $7m (2015: $8m) relating to the non-
deduction of tax losses previously claimed on hedge contracts. The AFIP is of the view that the financial derivatives could not 
be considered as hedge contracts, as hedge contract losses could only be offset against gains derived from the same kind of 
hedging contracts. Penalties and interest on the disputed amounts are estimated at a further $22m (2015: $24m). CVSA and 
AFIP have corresponded on this issue over the past several years and while management is of the opinion that the taxes are 
not payable, the government continues to assert its position regarding the use of the financial derivatives.  CVSA filed an 
appeal with the Tax Court on 19 June 2015.
Other
(9)   Groundwater  pollution  -  AngloGold  Ashanti  has  identified  groundwater  contamination  plumes  at  certain  of  its  operations, 
which have occurred primarily as a result of seepage from mine residue stockpiles. Numerous scientific, technical and legal 
studies  have  been  undertaken  to  assist  in  determining  the  magnitude  of  the  contamination  and  to  find  sustainable 
remediation solutions. The group has instituted processes to reduce future potential seepage and it has been demonstrated 
that Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA) by the existing environment will contribute to improvements in some instances.  
Furthermore, literature reviews, field trials and base line modelling techniques suggest, but have not yet proven, that the use 
of  phyto-technologies  can  address  the  soil  and  groundwater  contamination.  Subject  to  the  completion  of  trials  and  the 
technology being a proven remediation technique, no reliable estimate can be made for the obligation.
(10)   Deep  groundwater  pollution  -  The  group  has  identified  potential  water  ingress  and  future  pollution  risk  posed  by  deep 
groundwater in certain underground mines in Africa. Various studies have been undertaken by AngloGold Ashanti since 1999 
to  understand  this  potential  risk.   In  South  Africa,  due  to  the  interconnected  nature  of  mining  operations,  any  proposed 
solution needs to be a combined one supported by all the mines located in these gold fields. As a result, the Mineral and 
Petroleum  Resources  Development  Act  (MPRDA)  requires  that  the  affected  mining  companies  develop  a  Regional  Mine 
Closure Strategy to be approved by the Department of Mineral Resources. In view of the limitation of current information for 
the accurate estimation of a liability, no reliable estimate can be made for the obligation. 
 
Contingent asset 
Indemnity - As part of the acquisition by AngloGold Ashanti of the remaining 50% interest in MSG during June 2012, Kinross 
Gold Corporation (Kinross) has provided an indemnity to a maximum amount of BRL255m against the specific exposures

discussed in item 6 above. At 30 June 2016, the company has estimated that the maximum contingent asset is $8m (2015: 
$7m).
AngloGold  Ashanti  and  Anglo  American  South  Africa  settle  stand-alone  silicosis  claims  – On 4 March 2016 AngloGold 
Ashanti announced that together with Anglo American South Africa, the companies have concluded an agreement which resolves 
fully  and  finally  stand-alone  silicosis  claims.  The  settlement  relates  to  the  approximately  4,400  separate  claims  which  were 
instituted  against  Anglo  American  South  Africa  and  included  in  this  figure  are  the  roughly  1,200  separate  claims  against 
AngloGold Ashanti. 
 
The settlement has been reached without admission of liability by AngloGold Ashanti and Anglo American South Africa and the 
terms of the agreement remain confidential. Both companies will contribute, in stages, up to $30 million. 
 
AngloGold Ashanti noted publication of draft Mining Charter – On 18 April 2016 AngloGold Ashanti noted the publication by 
South Africa’s department of Mineral Resources of the draft reviewed Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment charter for the 
South African mining and minerals industry 2016. 
 
AngloGold Ashanti rating action by Standard and Poor’s rating agency (S&P) – On 26 April 2016 AngloGold Ashanti 
confirmed that Standard & Poor’s rating agency (S&P) had affirmed AngloGold Ashanti’s BB+ long-term corporate credit 
rating and revised the outlook to stable from negative. 
 
S&P cited the reduction in debt and increasing local currency gold prices as reasons for the increase in earnings, cash 
flows,  liquidity  and  credit  metrics  for  AngloGold  Ashanti.  The  stable  outlook  reflects  S&P’s  expectation  that  AngloGold 
Ashanti can maintain core credit metrics at the higher end of their intermediate category. 
 
AngloGold  Ashanti  Holdings  plc  announces  issuance  of  a  notice  for  the  conditional  redemption  of  all  of  its 
outstanding 8.5% notes due 2020 – On 28 June 2016 AngloGold Ashanti Holdings plc (the “Company”) announced that 
it had issued a notice for the conditional redemption (subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the condition described below) 
of all of its outstanding 8.5% Notes due 2020 (the “Notes”). 
 
Under the notice, the redemption of the Notes was conditioned upon the receipt by the Company of borrowings under the 
Company’s  $1,000,000,000  revolving  credit  facility  in  a  sufficient  amount,  together  with  available  cash  in  an  amount 
determined by the Company, to pay the redemption price for the Notes, including any applicable premium, and accrued 
and unpaid interest in full and pay all related expenses on or before the redemption date. The redemption date was 1 
August 2016. 
 
The notes were redeemed at a redemption price equal to 106.375% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, 
plus additional amounts, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the redemption. The Notes were redeemed in full.

Forward-looking statements
Certain statements contained in this document, other than statements of historical fact, including, without limitation, those concerning the economic outlook for the gold mining industry, 
expectations regarding gold prices, production, total cash costs, all-in sustaining costs, all-in costs, cost savings and other operating results, return on equity, productivity improvements, 
growth  prospects  and  outlook  of  AngloGold  Ashanti’s  operations,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  including  the  achievement  of  project  milestones,  commencement  and  completion  of 
commercial  operations  of  certain  of  AngloGold  Ashanti’s  exploration  and  production  projects  and  the  completion  of  acquisitions,  dispositions  or  joint  venture  transactions,  AngloGold 
Ashanti’s liquidity and capital resources and capital expenditures and the outcome and consequence of any potential or pending litigation or regulatory proceedings or environmental health 
and safety issues, are forward-looking statements regarding AngloGold Ashanti’s operations, economic performance and financial condition. These forward-looking statements or forecasts 
involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause AngloGold Ashanti’s actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated 
results, performance or achievements expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. Although AngloGold Ashanti believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking 
statements are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Accordingly, results could differ materially from those set out in the forward-
looking statements as a result of, among other factors, changes in economic, social and political and market conditions, the success of business and operating initiatives, changes in the 
regulatory  environment  and  other  government  actions,  including  environmental  approvals,  fluctuations  in  gold  prices  and  exchange  rates,  the  outcome  of  pending  or  future  litigation 
proceedings, and business and operational risk management. For a discussion of such risk factors, refer to AngloGold Ashanti’s annual reports on Form 20-F filed with the United States 
Securities and Exchange Commission. These factors are not necessarily all of  the  important  factors  that  could  cause  AngloGold  Ashanti’s  actual  results  to  differ  materially  from  those 
expressed in any forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on future results. Consequently, readers are cautioned not to 
place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. AngloGold Ashanti undertakes no obligation to update publicly or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect 
events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except to the extent required by applicable law. All subsequent written or oral forward-
looking statements attributable to AngloGold Ashanti or any person acting on its behalf are qualified by the cautionary statements herein.

GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the reported operating results or cash flow from operations or any other measures of performance 
prepared in accordance with IFRS. In addition, the presentation of these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures other companies may use. AngloGold Ashanti posts 
information  that  is  important  to  investors  on  the  main  page  of  its  website  at  www.anglogoldashanti.com  and  under  the  “Investors”  tab  on  the  main  page.  This information  is  updated
