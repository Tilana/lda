<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Submission of the report 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 
16/22 and decision 17/119, in which the Council requested the secretariat to provide an annual 
written update on the operations of the Voluntary Fund for participation in the universal 
periodic review and resources available to it. The present report provides an overview of the 
activities funded, as well as contributions received and expenditures incurred, on the basis of 
the terms of reference of the Fund. As this is the first such report prepared by the secretariat, 
information is provided retroactively to the establishment of the Fund in 2008. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Establishment of the Fund 
</b></p>
<p>2. In its resolution 5/1, the Human Rights Council called for the establishment of a 
voluntary trust fund to facilitate the participation of developing countries, particularly least 
developed countries, in the universal periodic review mechanism. At its sixth session, the 
Council adopted resolution 6/17, in which it reiterated its request for the Secretary-General 
to establish, inter alia, such a fund and requested the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to take the necessary measures with a view to 
expeditiously operationalizing the mechanism, and urged all member States, observers and 
other stakeholders of the Council to support its operationalization. 
</p>
<p>3. Following the approval of its terms of reference, the Fund became operational as a 
voluntary trust fund administered by the Secretary-General through OHCHR. Given the 
nature of the Fund and the activities it was designed to support, it was deemed unnecessary 
to establish a board of trustees. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Mandate of the Fund 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Fund can receive voluntary contributions from States, intergovernmental and 
non-governmental organizations or private institutions and individuals. Financial assistance 
may be requested by developing countries, in particular least developed countries, that are 
States Members of the United Nations.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Travel to meetings 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Fund was established to provide financial support for, inter alia: 
</p>
<p>(a) The travel of official representatives of developing countries, in particular the 
least developed countries, to Geneva to present the national report, take part in the ensuing 
interactive dialogue and be involved in the adoption of the report in the sessions of the 
Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review during which their country is considered; 
</p>
<p>(b) The travel of official representatives of developing countries, in particular the 
least developed countries, that are members of the Human Rights Council and that do not 
have a permanent mission in Geneva, to act as rapporteurs (that is, a member of the 
&#8213;troika&#8214;). 
</p>
<p>6. During the first cycle, in response to the request of numerous member States, the 
activities of the Fund were expanded to include funding for the participation of developing </p>


<p>countries, in particular least developed countries, in the plenary session of the Human 
Rights Council during which the outcome of their review is adopted. 
</p>
<p>7. Under the terms of reference, the travel assistance is provided through a retroactive 
payment procedure. The reimbursement of travel expenses to attend the sessions of the 
Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review and the sessions of the Human Rights 
Council is initiated upon request for financial assistance from the State concerned.  
</p>
<p>8. In accordance with established United Nations practice, arrangements were made for 
the Fund to cover one round-trip economy class ticket per delegation for a representative 
not residing in Geneva, as well as daily subsistence allowance (DSA) at the Geneva rate at 
the time of the meeting. Confirmation of approval is issued with an indication of the 
maximum ticket cost to be reimbursed. Applicable United Nations rules and procedures for 
official travel are followed and reimbursement is made only after completion of travel and 
upon receipt of a travel claim with supporting documentation. Reimbursement is made 
directly to the Government concerned, possibly through its permanent mission in either 
Geneva or New York. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Pre-session briefings to assist States in preparation for the review 
</b></p>
<p>9. During the first cycle, a number of briefings were organized prior to the sessions of 
the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review. Their objective was to inform 
Member States on how to prepare for their participation in the universal periodic review, 
including organizing a process of national consultation, drafting the national report and 
participating in the interactive dialogues in the Working Group and the Human Rights 
Council plenary. These briefings also focused on the policies and procedures of the Council 
and the Working Group as well as on the exchange of good practices and lessons learned. 
</p>
<p>10. The programme of these briefings consisted of plenary segments and break-out 
group discussions. During the plenary segments, the main provisions of Human Rights 
Council resolutions and decisions relating to the universal periodic review were presented. 
The break-out group segments allowed for more focused presentations and discussions on 
the main features of the universal periodic review process, such as the methodology for 
preparing the national report, including the consultation process, and the review process in 
the Working Group and in the Council plenary. The programmes were designed to ensure a 
balance between general presentations and specific segments, and keeping in consideration 
the fact that the universal periodic review is a holistic human rights process, as well as a 
cycle. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Financial situation of the Fund 
</b></p>
<p>11. Tables 1 and 2 show, respectively, the detailed financial situation of the Fund as at 
31 December 2011 (statement of income and expenditure) and the status of contributions as 
at the same date. 
</p>
<p>12. Since its establishment, 13 countries have made financial contributions to the Fund. 
Table 2 provides an overview of all contributions received. 
</p>
<p>13. Most of the contributions come from a small group of countries. Given the universal 
nature of the mechanism, all Member States are encouraged to contribute within their 
means. From 2008 to 2011, the income used to fund activities included both the annual 
voluntary contributions and the unallocated amounts carried over from previous years. 
Since the Fund has not enjoyed a predictable pattern of income, substantial resources have 
been kept as a reserve for future activities. The absence of regular pledges by donors </p>


<p>accounts for the conservative disbursement pattern, which is intended, inter alia, to ensure 
that enough funding is available at all material times for travel of delegations requesting 
financial assistance.

</p>
<p><b> IV. Activities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Travel to meetings 
</b></p>
<p>14. Since the establishment of the Fund, 67 States1 have requested financial assistance for 
travel to the Working Group sessions during which they were reviewed. Of these, 30 were 
least developed countries. In addition, 10 States requested financial assistance to travel to the 
session of the Human Rights Council for the adoption of the outcome of their review. As the 
Fund only became operational starting from the second session of the Working Group, 
countries reviewed during the first session did not have the possibility to request assistance. 
</p>
<p>  
 1 A total of 67 Member States have received support from the Voluntary Fund during the first cycle of 
</p>
<p>the universal periodic review: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Armenia, Belize, Bhutan, Bolivia 
(Plurinational State of), Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, 
Chad, Comoros, Costa Rica, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Dominica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Fiji, Grenada, Guinea, 
Guinea-Bissau, Honduras, Jamaica, Kenya, Kiribati, Kyrgyzstan, Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic, 
Lesotho, Liberia, Malawi, Maldives, Mali, Marshall Islands, Mauritania, Mauritius, Micronesia 
(Federated States of), Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nauru, Nicaragua, Niger, Palau, Papua New 
Guinea, Paraguay, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Sao 
Tome and Principe, Senegal, Seychelles, Solomon Islands, Suriname, Swaziland, Tajikistan, Timor-
Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, Uganda, Vanuatu and Yemen.  </p>


<p>15. The figure below and table 3 provide a breakdown of the financial assistance for the 
travel of Government delegates to Geneva by region and an overview of annual 
expenditures, complete with the amount authorized and the status of reimbursement, as well 
as total commitments to 31 December 2011. Only 26 out of 67 requests have been fully 
settled, with the remaining claims not yet closed because the recipient countries have not 
submitted the necessary documentation.

</b></p>
<p><b>Grand total   267,362 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p><p>16. To date, all States elected to the Human Rights Council have a permanent mission in 
Geneva. Consequently, there have been no requests for financial assistance to participate in 
a session as a rapporteur. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Training activities 
</b></p>
<p>17. A total of 23 briefings to assist countries in preparing for the universal periodic 
review have been organized by OHCHR and financed from the Fund (see annex). To date, a 
total of 106 countries have participated in these briefings, seminars and workshops. Due to </p>


<p>the fact that the first two sessions of the Working Group were held shortly after the 
adoption of Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, the countries reviewed at those sessions 
did not have the possibility to participate in training activities before their review. Many of 
them, however, participated in later seminars and briefings as resource countries. 
</p>
<p>18. In most cases these briefings were initiated by the secretariat and brought together 
both developing and developed countries; only the participation of the former was covered 
by the Fund in the form of reimbursement of travel expenses and DSA. 
</p>
<p>19. A few briefings were initiated at the request of States, other United Nations entities 
or intergovernmental organizations, such as the Organisation Internationale de la 
Francophonie (OIF), the Commonwealth Secretariat and the Council of Europe. The 
initiating entity produced a detailed description of the proposed training course, information 
on training arrangements, including location, facilities, logistical aspects, number and 
position of trainees, and an itemized statement of estimated cost. The venue for the 
briefings was determined based on proximity for intended participants and the availability 
of facilities. 
</p>
<p>20. Of the 23 briefings, 17 were held at the regional level, while the others were held at 
the national, subregional and interregional levels. During the first cycle, four national 
briefings were organized at the request of the countries concerned and, in the case of 
Somalia, following the Human Rights Council&#8217;s call for assistance to facilitate the 
country&#8217;s participation in the universal periodic review  
</p>
<p>21. The briefings drew extensively on the experience of States that had already 
undergone the review, as well as on the expertise of OHCHR regional offices, the 
secretariat and other intergovernmental or regional organizations. They were a forum for 
the exchange of information, and were aimed at helping States to organize a broad and 
participatory process of national consultation, to prepare a comprehensive and balanced 
national report and to become acquainted with the rules of procedure of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review and the plenary session of the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>22. The need to ensure a balance between the participation of a critical mass of States&#8212;
to ensure effective information and experience sharing&#8212;and the timeliness of the briefing 
for all participants, ideally six to nine months prior to the review, was possibly the main 
challenge of holding regional briefings, as not all countries were reviewed at the same 
session or even in the same calendar year. Countries were clearly at different stages of 
preparation, with some of those scheduled for review two or more years later not having 
even constituted the national teams yet. It is for this reason primarily that the secretariat 
proposed shifting to an interregional format, with all countries scheduled for review at the 
same session being briefed together. Such an approach is also aimed at promoting the 
exchange of information and best practices among countries from different geographical 
regions. Three such interregional briefings, for States scheduled for review during the first 
three sessions of the second universal periodic review cycle, were held in Madrid, Bangkok 
and Tunis at the end of 2011. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>23. <b>Throughout the first universal periodic review cycle, the Voluntary Fund for 
participation in the universal periodic review has been used to finance the 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation of requesting Member States in the relevant sessions of the Working 
</b></p>
<p><b>Group on the Universal Periodic Review. Assistance was also provided for Member 
</b></p>
<p><b>States that do not have representation in Geneva, in order to enable them to 
</b></p>
<p><b>participate in the adoption of their outcome document in the Human Rights Council </b></p>


<p><b>plenary. The Fund has also been used to organize and fund the participation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>officials in field-based preparatory briefings for the universal periodic review. 
</b></p>
<p>24. <b>Although the parameters for financing the participation of developing country 
Member States in the universal periodic review sessions are consistent with 
</b></p>
<p><b>established practice for the General Assembly, the post facto reimbursement 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedure has proven unsatisfactory, as the recipient Member States have 
</b></p>
<p><b>experienced difficulties in submitting the required documentation to enable the 
</b></p>
<p><b>settlement of the claims. The secretariat is therefore proposing a revision of the terms 
</b></p>
<p><b>of reference for the Fund to make it possible for tickets to be provided in advance of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the sessions. Upon approval of the proposed modifications, a detailed note with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>revised modalities will be circulated to all delegations. 
</b></p>
<p>25. <b>During the review of the work and functioning of the Human Rights Council, 
Member States again requested that the Fund be strengthened and operationalized in 
</b></p>
<p><b>order to encourage the significant participation of developing countries, particularly 
</b></p>
<p><b>least developing countries; they also requested that special attention be given to small 
</b></p>
<p><b>island developing States (Council resolution 16/21, para. 14). Accordingly, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>secretariat is proposing that that the revision of the terms of reference of the Fund 
</b></p>
<p><b>provide for a more substantial travel assistance for least developing countries and 
</b></p>
<p><b>small island developing States. 
</b></p>
<p>26. <b>As regards the pre-session briefings organized by the secretariat, it is planned 
to further pursue the recently initiated shift to interregional briefings. Moreover, it is 
</b></p>
<p><b>proposed that national human rights institutions consistent with the principles 
</b></p>
<p><b>relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights (Paris Principles) be more systematically associated with these briefings. </b></p>
