<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> In 2006, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health visited Sweden. The primary purpose of this 
mission was to prepare a report on how the Government was implementing the right to the 
highest attainable standard of health within the territory of Sweden. Additionally, however, the 
mission briefly considered some of Sweden&#8217;s impressive international policies relating to 
development and the promotion of human rights, including the right to health. The Special 
Rapporteur submitted his report on this mission to the Human Rights Council in 2007 
(A/HRC/4/28/Add.2). 
</p>
<p> Subsequently, the Government agreed that the Special Rapporteur might examine in more 
detail the implementation of Sweden&#8217;s international policies that bear upon the right to health. In 
October 2006, the Special Rapporteur visited Washington, D.C. to discuss with the Executive 
Directors of the Nordic-Baltic countries in the World Bank and International Monetary Fund 
(IMF), as well as other staff, how they sought to take account of Sweden&#8217;s international human 
rights policies in their work. In February 2007, the Special Rapporteur visited Uganda to 
examine how Sweden, especially the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency 
(Sida), contributes to the realization of the right to the highest attainable standard of health in 
Uganda. The present report is based on these visits and discussions. 
</p>
<p> Section I outlines the human rights responsibility of international assistance and 
cooperation in health. It applies generally to all donors and members of the World Bank and 
IMF. The report then applies this framework to aspects of Swedish policy and practice in 
Uganda, as well as the work of the relevant Executive Directors in the World Bank and IMF. 
</p>
<p> The report pays particular attention to the issue of how to enhance accountability for the 
discharge of donors&#8217; human rights responsibility of international assistance and cooperation in 
health. It includes numerous recommendations bearing upon a wide range of actors. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p><b>Background:  the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit to Sweden in 2006 
</b></p>
<p>1. In January 2006, the Special Rapporteur undertook a mission to Sweden. While the 
primary objective of this visit was to examine Sweden&#8217;s right to health duties within its 
jurisdiction, the visit also provided an opportunity to consider how Sweden gives effect to the 
right to health in its international policies and programmes. 
</p>
<p>2. In his report on the mission (A/HRC/4/28/Add.2), which he presented to the Human Rights 
Council in 2007, the Special Rapporteur commended the Government of Sweden for its 
commitment to mainstreaming human rights in its foreign policies, including those on 
international development. This commitment is enshrined in an important document, 
<i>Human Rights in Swedish Foreign Policy</i>, which was adopted in 2003. 
</p>
<p>3. In his mission report, the Special Rapporteur raised the following two fundamental 
questions about the operationalization of Sweden&#8217;s international human rights policy: 
</p>
<p> (a) To what degree has this policy actually been brought to bear upon all aspects of 
Sweden&#8217;s foreign policy? For example, while the policy has been given careful consideration by 
the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), has it also been given due 
attention in relation to Sweden&#8217;s policies regarding the World Bank, International Monetary 
Fund (IMF) and international trade? 
</p>
<p> (b) To what degree has the policy actually been operationalized? Has Sida, for example, 
managed to operationalize the policy on the ground in developing countries?  
</p>
<p>4. In his report, the Special Rapporteur remarked that if these questions were to be subject to 
close examination, they should not only be put to public officials in Stockholm, but also to some 
of those working overseas. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur is therefore very grateful to the Government of Sweden for 
inviting him to pursue these questions by meeting those Executive Directors who represent 
Sweden&#8217;s interests in the World Bank and IMF, and by visiting the Swedish Embassies in 
Uganda and Zambia, two countries where Sida provides significant support for health-related 
activities. 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur subsequently wrote to the Governments of Uganda and Zambia 
requesting to undertake visits to these countries. While the Government of Uganda agreed to the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, to his regret the Government of Zambia did not extend an invitation. 
Therefore the Special Rapporteur met with the Executive Directors representing Sweden in the 
IMF and World Bank in Washington, D.C. and visited Uganda but not Zambia. 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur undertook a mission to Uganda in March 2005. The primary 
objective of this visit was to address the issue of neglected diseases in relation to the right to the 
highest attainable standard of health in Uganda. One of the objectives of the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s visit to Uganda in February 2007 was to follow up on the recommendations made </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/11/Add.2 
  page 5 
 
</p>
<p>in the report on his mission undertaken in 2005 (E/CN.4/2006/48/Add.2). The Special 
Rapporteur will pursue this very important right to health issue by way of letter to the 
Government of Uganda. The letter and all subsequent correspondence will be included in next 
year&#8217;s Communications report. 
</p>
<p><b>Visit to Uganda 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur visited Uganda from 4 to 7 February 2007. The central objective of 
the mission was to understand how Sweden, in particular Sida, contributes to the realization of 
the right to the highest attainable standard of health in Uganda. In other words, the report 
considers Sweden&#8217;s human rights responsibility of international assistance and cooperation in 
health in the Ugandan context. 
</p>
<p>9. During the mission, the Special Rapporteur met with the Minister for Health and officials 
at the Ministry of Health. He also met the Minister of State and senior officials of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and of the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development. The 
Special Rapporteur held extensive discussions with senior staff at the Swedish Embassy, 
including the Charg&#233; d&#8217;Affaires and the First Secretary responsible for health. He held meetings 
with a number of representatives of international organizations and United Nations agencies 
working in Uganda, including the World Health Organization (WHO), the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the 
United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the United Nations Children&#8217;s 
Fund (UNICEF). He also met other international organizations and donors, including the 
World Bank, European Commission, Belgian Technical Cooperation and the Danish 
International Development Agency. The Special Rapporteur met with the Uganda Human Rights 
Commission. He also held consultations with representatives of numerous civil society 
organizations, including the Ugandan Medical Association. 
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur visited Mpingi district, where he met with the District Director of 
Health Services, as well as a village health team. He also visited three civil society organizations 
working on sexual and reproductive health issues and supported by Sida, namely TASO, the 
Straight Talk Foundation, and the Naguru Teenage Information and Health Centre. 
</p>
<p><b>Visit to Washington, D.C. 
</b></p>
<p>11. On 20 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur held meetings with the Executive Directors 
and other staff of the Nordic-Baltic countries at the World Bank and the IMF in 
Washington, D.C. The central objective of this visit was to understand the role of Sweden in 
relation to its membership of the World Bank and IMF and in the context of the right to the 
highest attainable standard of health. In other words, the report considers Sweden&#8217;s human rights 
responsibility of international assistance and cooperation in health in the context of its 
membership of the World Bank and IMF. 
</p>
<p><b>The present report 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur takes this opportunity to thank all those whom he met on his visits 
to Uganda and Washington, D.C. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/11/Add.2 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>13. While much of this report focuses on these visits, the following section has general 
application. It outlines the human rights responsibility of international assistance and 
cooperation in health. This is not only relevant to Sweden, but all donors, as well as members 
of the World Bank and IMF. 
</p>
<p>14. The human rights responsibility of international assistance and cooperation in health 
extends to all States, both developed and developing. All States, for example, have a human 
rights duty to &#8220;do no harm&#8221; to their neighbours. This report, however, focuses on the human 
rights responsibility of international assistance and cooperation in relation to high-income 
countries, such as Sweden. 
</p>
<p>15. There is increasingly rich discussion about what international assistance and cooperation 
means when this phrase is used in international human rights instruments.<b>1</b> International 
assistance and cooperation is easier to grasp when focusing on specifics. Thus, this report looks 
at international assistance and cooperation in relation to one sector (health), one donor (Sweden), 
and one recipient country (Uganda). Its focus is practice, rather than doctrine. The report aims to 
give practical guidance about the application of the human rights responsibility of international 
assistance and cooperation in health. 
</p>
<p>16. One of the recurrent themes in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s reports since 2003 has been the 
human rights responsibility of international assistance and cooperation in health. He has looked 
at this issue in several thematic reports (such as E/CN.4/2005/51, A/59/422 and A/60/348) and 
country reports (such as E/CN.4/2006/48/Add.2 and E/CN.4/2004/49/Add.1). The present report 
aims to build on, and further particularize, this work. 
</p>
<p><b>II. THE HUMAN RIGHTS RESPONSIBILITY OF INTERNATIONAL  
ASSISTANCE AND COOPERATION IN HEALTH 
</b></p>
<p>17. Health is not just a matter of domestic laws, policies and circumstances. The policies of 
other States, including in trade and development, as well as the policies of intergovernmental 
organizations such as the World Bank and the IMF, also have a profound impact on health. The 
control of infectious diseases, the dissemination of health research and so on has an international 
dimension. In practice, the realization of the right to the highest attainable standard of health is 
dependent upon international assistance and cooperation. This is especially crucial in relation to 
low-income countries. Thus, it is very important to clarify the contours and content of the human 
rights responsibility of international assistance and cooperation in health.

food e.g. E/CN.4/2005/47; and the work of the Working Group on the Right to Development 
e.g. A/HRC/4/WG.2/2. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/11/Add.2 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>18. The right to the highest attainable standard of health is recognized in international human 
rights treaties ratified by Sweden, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). As a State 
party to ICESCR and CRC, Sweden not only has a duty to give effect to the right to health 
domestically, but also through &#8220;international assistance and cooperation&#8221;.<b>2</b> This human rights 
responsibility of international assistance and cooperation is reflected in other important 
international instruments, not least the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights and the Declaration on the Right to Development. Moreover, this human rights 
responsibility resonates with other international commitments, such as Millennium Development 
Goal 8. 
</p>
<p>19. In recent years, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and others have 
developed a way of analysing or &#8220;unpacking&#8221; the right to the highest attainable standard of 
health with a view to making it easier to understand and apply.<b>3</b> The Special Rapporteur and 
others have refined this analytical approach and, more importantly, applied it to specific health 
issues (e.g. mental disability, the skills drain, and maternal mortality) and particular country 
situations (e.g. Peru, Romania and Mozambique). 
</p>
<p>20. Drawing upon this analytical approach, as well as experience gained from its application, 
the following paragraphs outline the contours and content of the human rights responsibility of 
international assistance and cooperation in health. 
</p>
<p>21. <i>A supplementary responsibility</i>: Sweden&#8217;s human rights responsibility of international 
assistance and cooperation in health does not qualify, limit or condition the obligation of the 
Government of Uganda to do all it can to realize the right to the highest attainable standard of 
health within its available resources and consistent with its other human rights responsibilities. 
</p>
<p>22. <i>Responsibilities</i> <i>to seek and provide assistance</i>: International assistance and cooperation 
includes a responsibility on States to seek appropriate assistance and cooperation, and a 
responsibility on States in a position to assist to provide appropriate assistance and cooperation. 
</p>
<p>23. <i>Resource availability</i>: States are required to take targeted steps to progressively realize the 
right to health, subject &#8220;to the maximum of its available resources&#8221;.4 This includes resources 
available from the international community. Hence the responsibility of a developing State to 
seek appropriate international assistance and cooperation. 
</p>
<p>24. Equally, however, the human rights responsibility to <i>provide</i> international assistance and 
cooperation is also subject to the resources available to a donor. This gives rise to difficult 
questions. For example, how much should a donor be expected to contribute in the light of its 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  ICESCR articles 2.1 and 12; CRC article 4. Also see the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p>articles 55 and 56 and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, articles 22 and 28.

</b>  ICESCR, art. 2, para. 1. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/11/Add.2 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>resource availability? When addressing this question, it can be very instructive to consider the 
record of comparable donors. It is because international assistance and cooperation give rise to 
complex, sensitive and important issues that it should be subject to appropriate mechanisms of 
accountability (see below). 
</p>
<p>25. <i>Financial assistance</i>: The human rights responsibility of international assistance and 
cooperation includes a duty on high-income States to urgently take deliberate, concrete and 
progressive measures towards devoting a minimum of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product 
(GNP) to development assistance.<b>5</b> In 2001, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights commended Sweden for meeting and sometimes surpassing this target.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>26. <i>Non-financial dimensions of assistance and cooperation</i>: Crucially, international assistance 
and cooperation must not be narrowly understood as a duty to provide financial assistance. States 
must ensure their various international policies do not obstruct, but support, the realization of the 
right to the highest attainable standard of health in other countries. They have a responsibility to 
work actively towards an equitable multilateral trade, investment and financial system conducive 
to the reduction of poverty and the realization of human rights, including the right to the highest 
attainable standard of health. 
</p>
<p>27. <i>Key right-to-health features that international assistance and cooperation should support</i>: International assistance and cooperation should be directed to give effect to key features of the 
right to the highest attainable standard of health, including the following: 
</p>
<p> (a) <i>Freedoms and entitlements</i>: Freedoms include the right to be free from 
discrimination. Entitlements encompass medical care and underlying determinants of health, 
such as safe drinking water and adequate sanitation. The right to health includes specific 
entitlements to maternal, child and sexual and reproductive health. Guaranteeing such freedoms 
and entitlements should be central to States&#8217; development and other international policies. The 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights confirms that donors should give particular 
priority to helping low-income countries realize their &#8220;core obligations&#8221; arising from the right to 
health;<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p> (b) <i>Equality and non-discrimination</i>: These are integral to the right to the highest 
attainable standard of health. In their international policies, States should give particular 
attention to securing the right to health for disadvantaged individuals, communities and 
populations, such as women, ethnic minorities, indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, the 
elderly, children, persons living with HIV/AIDS, sexual minorities, and those living in poverty; 
</p>
<p> (c) <i>Participation</i>: Those affected are entitled to participate in health-related 
policymaking and implementation. Thus, in the recipient country, international assistance and 
</p>

  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>cooperation in health should promote such participation, especially by those who are 
disadvantaged. Also, donors&#8217; policies of international assistance and cooperation in health should 
themselves be designed and implemented with the participation of such groups; 
</p>
<p> (d) <i>Monitoring and accountability</i>: Without monitoring and accountability, the right to 
health can be no more than window dressing. Accordingly, international assistance and 
cooperation in health should promote effective monitoring and accountability in recipient 
countries. Also, donors should themselves be held to account for the discharge of their human 
rights responsibilities of international assistance and cooperation in health (see below). 
</p>
<p>28. <i>Obligations to respect, protect </i>and<i> fulfil</i>: The right to health gives rise to three layers of 
obligations on States: to <i>respect, protect </i>and <i>fulfil</i>. In the context of international assistance and 
cooperation in health, States must ensure that their actions <i>respect</i> the right to health in other 
countries. They must also, so far as possible, <i>protect </i>against third parties undermining the right 
to health in other countries. Depending on resource availability, States&#8217; obligations to <i>fulfil</i> the 
right to health include responsibilities to facilitate access to essential health facilities and services 
in other countries.<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>29. <i>Procedural fairness</i>: The requirements of procedural fairness extend to international 
assistance and cooperation. For example, donors have a responsibility not to withdraw critical 
right-to-health aid without first giving the recipient reasonable notice and opportunity to make 
alternative arrangements.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>30. <i>Coherence</i>: The international right to health must be applied consistently and coherently 
across all relevant national and international policymaking processes.<b>10</b> This includes, for 
example, the policies of international financial institutions, such as the World Bank and the IMF, 
as well as States&#8217; international development, trade and other policies that bear upon health.<b>11</b> 
</p>
<p><b>III. SWEDEN&#8217;S POLICY FRAMEWORKS ON DEVELOPMENT,  
HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>Sweden&#8217;s national policy commitments 
</b></p>
<p>31. During his mission to Sweden in 2006, the Special Rapporteur was impressed by the 
commitment to human rights in Sweden&#8217;s foreign policies, including its international

</p>
<p>development policies. <i>Human Rights in Swedish Foreign Policy </i>emphasizes that human rights 
are a primary concern of Swedish foreign policy. The document includes a commitment to 
mainstream human rights into the work of global and regional organizations. 
</p>
<p>32. Human rights are also one of four key objectives in <i>Shared Responsibility: Sweden&#8217;s 
Policy for Global Development. </i>The policy includes an important commitment to mainstream 
human rights across all areas of policy connected to international development. Sweden&#8217;s key 
health and development policy, <i>Health is Wealth</i>, as well as <i>Sweden&#8217;s International Policy on 
Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights</i>, also both include commitments to a human 
rights-based approach to health and development issues. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Sweden&#8217;s international policy commitments 
</b></p>
<p>33. In addition to Sweden&#8217;s national policies, it has globally agreed commitments on 
development and health. Only some of these commitments explicitly embrace human rights. 
</p>
<p>34. Global commitments which have shaped the development and international agenda include 
the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development 
(1994), the Platform for Action of the Fourth World Conference for Women (1995), the 
Millennium Declaration (2000), the Monterrey Consensus on Financing for Development 
(2002), and the Plan of Implementation of the World Conference on Sustainable Development 
(2002). These commitments explicitly recognize the links between development, health and 
human rights. They have informed, and support, Sweden&#8217;s international development assistance 
policies.  
</p>
<p><b>Millennium Development Goals  
</b></p>
<p>35. The Millennium Development Goals have come to play a defining role in international 
development, including the policies of donors such as Sida, as well as those of international 
organizations such as the World Bank and the IMF, and developing countries such as Uganda. 
Three of the Millennium Development Goals are directly focused on health - the reduction of 
child mortality, improvement of maternal health and combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other 
diseases. While the Millennium Development Goals do not explicitly include a commitment 
to human rights, they have great potential to support the realization of the right to health 
(see A/60/438). 
</p>
<p><b>Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness 
</b></p>
<p>36. The Paris Declaration, agreed in 2005 by 90 States, including Sweden, and 26 multilateral 
organizations, enshrines 56 commitments to make aid more effective. The commitments are 
organized around five main principles: 
</p>
<p> (a) <i>Ownership</i>: Partner countries exercise effective leadership over their development

development strategies, institutions and procedures; </p>

</p>
<p> (c) <i>Harmonization</i>: Donors&#8217; actions are more harmonized, transparent and collectively 
effective; 
</p>
<p> (d) <i>Managing for results</i>: Donors and partners manage and implement aid in a way that 
focuses on the desired results and uses information to improve decision-making; 
</p>
<p> (e) <i>Mutual accountability</i>: Donors and partners are accountable for development results. 
</p>
<p>37. In 2007, the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) published the <i>Action-Oriented Policy Paper on Human 
Rights and Development</i>, in which it emphasized the &#8220;potential for the international human rights 
framework and the Paris Declaration to reinforce and benefit from each other&#8221;.<b>12</b> The Paris 
Declaration has the potential to support the realization of the right to health, while in turn the 
right to health can support the realization of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>38. However, if the Paris Declaration is to support the right to health, then this fundamental 
human right must help to define the processes and outcome of development. Without a concerted 
effort to protect and integrate the right to health in the context of national ownership, alignment 
and harmonization, there is a danger that the right to health will be sidelined. There is a risk that 
the Paris Declaration will lead to the &#8220;lowest common denominator&#8221;, whereby consensus is 
achieved at the expense of the promotion and protection of the right to health, including 
particularly sensitive issues such as sexual and reproductive health rights. 
</p>
<p>39. All States have ratified at least one international treaty recognizing the right to health. 
Many also have national constitutional and other legal or policy commitments towards the right 
to health. The right to health therefore represents a shared commitment of donors and aid 
recipients. It can act as a common platform for development partnerships in contexts of national 
ownership, alignment and harmonization. As such, the right to health can and should be 
integrated into development agreements and policies. 
</p>
<p><b>The challenge of implementation 
</b></p>
<p>40. Sweden&#8217;s policies on health, development and human rights are among the best in the 
world and deserve applause and support. On the whole, Sweden&#8217;s policies are consistent with its 
human rights responsibility of international assistance and cooperation in health. The challenge 
is to put these policies into practice.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>41. While some of Sweden&#8217;s international development commitments explicitly recognize the 
links between health, human rights and development, regrettably the Millennium Development 
Goals and the Paris Declaration do not. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that Sweden 
give particular attention to ensuring that its human rights policies and international 
human rights obligations are given central attention in the context of implementation of the 
Millennium Development Goals and the Paris Declaration.

<p><b>IV. INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE AND COOPERATION  
IN HEALTH:  SIDA&#8217;S EXPERIENCE IN UGANDA 
</b></p>
<p>42. This section considers Sweden&#8217;s human rights responsibility of international assistance and 
cooperation in health (outlined above in section II) in the specific context of Uganda. It focuses 
on the work of Sida.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  The right to health in Uganda 
</b></p>
<p>43. Uganda is - like Sweden - a State party to international human rights instruments 
recognizing the right to the highest attainable standard of health, including ICESCR, CRC and 
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. 
</p>
<p>44. Uganda&#8217;s national Constitution also provides that &#8220;all Ugandans enjoy rights and 
opportunities and access to education, health services, clean and safe water, work, decent shelter, 
adequate clothing, food security and pension and retirement benefits&#8221;,<b>13</b> and makes special 
reference to the human rights of women, children and persons with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>45. <b>In view of Sweden&#8217;s responsibilities under ICESCR and CRC, the principle of 
alignment enshrined in the Paris Declaration, and Uganda&#8217;s domestic and international 
right to health obligations, the Special Rapporteur welcomes Sweden&#8217;s international 
assistance and cooperation in health, which helps the Government of Uganda to fulfil its 
constitutional and international obligations towards the right to health.</b> 
</p>
<p>46. The Ugandan health and development context provides important background to 
understanding how Sweden contributes to the realization of the right to health in this country. 
Due to the word limits of this report, the Special Rapporteur refers readers to the analysis of 
health and development provided by the report on his mission to Uganda in 2005.<b>14</b>  
</p>
<p><b>B. How does Swedish development assistance support the realization  
of the right to health in Uganda? 
</b></p>
<p><b>Sida&#8217;s development assistance strategy in Uganda 
</b></p>
<p>47. Sweden&#8217;s <i>Country Strategy for Development Cooperation, Uganda: 2001-2005</i> remained 
the basis for Sida&#8217;s development assistance to Uganda at the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
mission. The Strategy emphasizes that combating poverty in accordance with Uganda&#8217;s Poverty 
Eradication Action Plan (PEAP) is Sweden&#8217;s overall objective for development collaboration 
with Uganda. Key elements of the Strategy include support to the social sector, including health, 
and to democratic development and the promotion of fundamental human rights. The Strategy 
places particular emphasis on strengthening the rights of women and children. 
</p>
<p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/11/Add.2 
  page 13 
 
</p>
<p>48. Despite its commendable focus on health and human rights, the Strategy does not explicitly 
recognize the right to health. Human rights are not mainstreamed consistently throughout 
Sweden&#8217;s development cooperation in Uganda, including in Sida&#8217;s support to the health sector. 
<b>Sida should mainstream human rights, including the right to health, in its Uganda Country 
Strategy. Consideration of the key features of the right to health will help Sweden realize 
its human rights responsibility of international assistance and cooperation in health.</b> 
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn that Sida&#8217;s staff in Kampala is committed to 
integrating a human rights-based approach into Sweden&#8217;s forthcoming Uganda Country Strategy. 
An adequate understanding of human rights, including the right to health, by Sida staff in 
country offices such as Uganda is vital if the organization is to operationalize its excellent 
policies on health, human rights and development in Uganda and elsewhere. <b>The Special 
Rapporteur recommends that Sida enhance its provision of training, resources and advice 
on health and human rights that is available to its staff in country offices, including in 
Uganda.</b> 
</p>
<p>50.<b> As far as possible, Sida should also extend training and capacity-building on human 
rights to Ugandan health policymakers and other health development partners in Uganda. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The level of assistance for the right to health provided by Sweden to Uganda 
</b></p>
<p>51. A large number of international organizations, donors and non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs) are engaged in development assistance in Uganda. Between 1994 and 2004, aid flows 
averaged 11 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). However, the Uganda health sector 
remains seriously underfunded. While African heads of State and Government have set a target 
of devoting at least 15 per cent of their budgets to health,<b>15</b> the Government of Uganda currently 
devotes only 9 per cent. Without more funds, many of Uganda&#8217;s impressive health policies, 
including many elements of the Health Sector Strategic Plan II (HSSPII), will not be 
operationalized. 
</p>
<p>52. In terms of volume of aid for health, Sida is one of the largest donors working in Uganda, 
providing significant assistance to the health sector. In 2006, Sida provided US$ 55 million 
development assistance to Uganda, including US$ 13 million for health, as well as 
US$ 13 million for humanitarian assistance, which encompassed health. 
</p>
<p>53. While commending the Government of Sweden, the Special Rapporteur urges Sida to 
continue to provide generous support to health in Uganda, and to work together with the 
Government of Uganda and other donors to ensure that adequate funding is provided to the 
health sector.

</p>
<p><b>Sida&#8217;s support to key right-to-health stakeholders in Uganda 
</b></p>
<p>54. Sida provides support to a range of actors who have a critical role in operationalizing the 
right to health in Uganda, including the Government, international organizations, the Uganda 
Human Rights Commission and civil society. 
</p>
<p><i>Government 
</i></p>
<p>55. <i>The right to health in Sweden&#8217;s agreements with the Government of Uganda</i>: Four 
agreements form the basis of this support: the Memorandum of Understanding between the 
Government of Sweden and the Government of Uganda on Development Cooperation 
(2001-2003);<b>16</b> the Specific Agreement between the Government of Sweden and the Government 
of Uganda on Health Sector Support (July 2003-June 2007); the Partnership Principles between 
the Government of Uganda and its Development Partners (2003); and the Memorandum of 
Understanding between the Government of Uganda and various health partners for the 
Implementation of the National Health Policy and the HSSPII (2005-2010).  
</p>
<p>56. Significantly, none of these agreements refer to the right to health. Only the first agreement 
includes human rights as a point of reference. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
right to health, and other human rights, are explicitly and consistently integrated into 
Sida&#8217;s development cooperation agreements with Uganda. 
</b></p>
<p>57. <i>Sector and direct budget support</i>: Concerned by fragmented planning and delivery of aid, 
the Government of Uganda is keen to ensure that aid is aligned with national policies and 
administrative processes. With this in mind, the Government has encouraged donors to commit 
to budget or sectoral support, rather than project-based support. 
58. The health-related development cooperation agreements between the Government of 
Uganda and Sida emphasize that Sida&#8217;s support to the Government will be primarily provided by 
way of health sector support and direct budget support. In 2006, Sida delivered approximately 
one third of its development assistance by way of direct budget support, and one third by way of 
sectoral support to the health sector. 
</p>
<p>59. The provision of development assistance by way of sector or budget support means that 
much of Sida&#8217;s development assistance to the Government is aligned to the priorities identified 
in Uganda&#8217;s national health-related policies. In order to understand how Sida supports the right 
to health in Uganda, it is therefore important to understand how the right to health is promoted 
and protected in the context of Uganda&#8217;s national health-related policies. 
</p>
<p>60. In recent years, the Government and its development partners, including Sida, as well as 
international organizations and civil society, have begun to give attention to the relationship 
between the Government&#8217;s health policies and human rights. The Government, with support 
from WHO and OHCHR, convened a health and human rights stakeholders&#8217; meeting in 2006. In 
the same year, the Ministry of Health and other partners established a Health and Human Rights

</p>
<p>Team, to be coordinated by the Ministry of Health. During his mission, the Special Rapporteur 
participated in a workshop organized by the Ministry of Health, Sida, WHO and OHCHR on the 
issue of a human rights-based approach to health. 
</p>
<p>61. The workshop provided important insights into the strengths and weakness of HSSPII from 
the point of view of the right to health, such as: 
</p>
<p> (a) <i>Explicit commitment to the right to health and other human rights</i>: The HSSPII does 
not explicitly recognize the right to health, or mainstream a right to health approach. However, 
the Plan does include explicit commitments to the rights of people with psychosocial disabilities 
(&#8220;the mentally ill&#8221;) and to sexual and reproductive health rights; 
</p>
<p> (b) <i>Attention to key right to health issues</i>: Although the right to health is not explicitly 
mainstreamed throughout HSSPII, the document nevertheless includes commitments to 
important right to health issues, including health systems strengthening. While the document 
includes a commitment to sexual and reproductive health rights, with a particular focus on 
reducing maternal mortality, it does not give adequate attention to important but particularly 
sensitive sexual and reproductive health rights issues in Uganda, such as the high rate of unsafe 
abortion, and the right to health of particular groups, including men who have sex with men; 
</p>
<p> (c) <i>Equality and non-discrimination</i>: HSSPII includes gender as a cross-cutting theme. It 
enshrines the right to health principles of equality and non-discrimination through attention to 
the rights of children, women and other vulnerable groups, including people living in poverty;  
</p>
<p> (d) <i>Participation</i>: HSSPII includes important commitments to participation. Civil society 
was involved in the development of the policy, and is also playing an important role in 
implementation and monitoring. HSSPII includes important commitments to community 
participation in the development and delivery of health care and promotion, including through 
the mechanism of Village Health Teams (VHTs). VHTs usually constitute five volunteers from 
the community and trained by the Ministry of Health. The teams help deliver drugs and health 
information. They have a potentially important role to help identify communities&#8217; health needs. 
The VHTs serve as the first link between the community and the formal health providers. 
HSSPII states that the establishment of functional VHTs is a priority; 
</p>
<p> (e) <i>Monitoring and accountability</i>: HSSPII includes a focus on monitoring and 
accountability. However, from the point of view of the right to health, some features should be 
strengthened. For example, indicators are not consistently disaggregated, making it difficult to 
monitor the human rights principles of equality and non-discrimination. 
</p>
<p>62. <b>In order to support the realization of the right to health in Uganda, the Special 
Rapporteur encourages Sida to support the Government of Uganda in its endeavours to 
mainstream the right to health in HSSPII, as well as other health-related policies, such as 
the Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP).  
</b>63. <b>The Special Rapporteur also recommends that Sida endeavour to ensure that 
important right to health issues which are not fully captured in the Governments policies, 
such as sexual and reproductive health rights, are given attention in its dialogue and 
agreements with the Government and other actors. </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/7/11/Add.2 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>64. <b>Despite the merits of HSSPII, the Special Rapporteur emphasizes that some of the 
Plan&#8217;s priorities remain underfunded. He urges Sida to work with the Government of 
Uganda to ensure adequate funding for implementation of the Plan. 
</b></p>
<p>65. <i>Harmonization between donors</i>: As well as promoting donor alignment with national 
policies, the Government of Uganda promotes harmonization of development assistance between 
donors. This has led, for example, to the Health Sector Wide Approach (2000), the Partnership 
Principles for the PEAP (2003) and, most recently, the Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy 
(UJAS: 2005-2009) prepared by seven donors including Sida. The UJAS will form a framework 
for Sida&#8217;s development cooperation with Uganda until 2009.  
</p>
<p>66. <b>Alignment and harmonization have reportedly led to greater coordination between 
donors in planning and delivery of aid, and have also lessened administrative burdens on 
the Government of Uganda. From this point of view, the Special Rapporteur commends the 
efforts of donors. 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>The Special Rapporteur encourages Sida to ensure that the right to health informs 
harmonization and is not neglected in the search for common ground between donors. 
</b></p>
<p><i>International organizations 
</i></p>
<p>68. In Uganda, Sida provides financial support for programmes and activities of, and engages 
in dialogue with, a range of international organizations, including WHO, UNFPA, UNAIDS and 
UNICEF. Many of them support important programmes, or provide technical advice, relating to 
the right to health in Uganda. 
</p>
<p>69. Since 2005, Sida has provided funding for the appointment of a Health and Human Rights 
Officer in WHO Uganda, who played an important role in promoting awareness of health and 
human rights issues in Uganda and supporting initial steps towards the integration of human 
rights in policy and development planning within the health sector. <b>The Special Rapporteur 
warmly commends this important collaboration between Sida and WHO Uganda. The 
Special Rapporteur encourages Sweden to continue to provide strategic support to 
international organizations working on health and human rights in Uganda. He encourages 
Sida to continue to provide support to WHO in Kampala by ensuring funding for the post 
of a Health and Human Rights Officer. 
</b></p>
<p><i>Uganda Human Rights Commission 
</i></p>
<p>70. The Uganda Human Rights Commission is active on issues such as human rights 
education, complaints handling, visits to places of detention, and the situation of disadvantaged 
groups, such as women, children and people living with HIV/AIDS. In 2005-2006, Denmark, 
Ireland and Sweden contributed US$ 1.4 million to the Commission by way of a basket-fund. 
</p>
<p>71. To its great credit, the Commission has recently established a right-to-health unit to 
monitor, and hold to account, national and international actors in the public and private health 
sectors. However, currently the unit has negligible funding. <b>The Special Rapporteur </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/11/Add.2 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p><b>emphasizes that accountability provided by national human rights institutions has an 
important role to play in holding duty bearers to account for the right to health. He 
therefore vigorously encourages Sida and other development partners to support this 
important new initiative.  
</b></p>
<p><i>Civil society organizations 
</i></p>
<p>72. Civil society organizations (CSOs) play an important role as health service providers in 
Uganda. In recent years, they have also become increasingly engaged in advocacy. They have 
engaged with the Government in formulating, implementing and monitoring key health policies, 
such as HSSPII and PEAP. Through their advocacy, they have enhanced awareness of human 
rights issues in the health sector. 
</p>
<p>73. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that Sida support the participation of CSOs in 
policymaking forums and monitoring mechanisms, such as health sector working groups, 
Joint Review Missions and the National Health Assembly. 
</b></p>
<p>74. In 2005, Sida contributed approximately US$ 15 million for organizations working on 
HIV/AIDS and also on young people. <b>The Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to visit 
three of these organizations during his visit (see above) and commends Sida for its support 
to these excellent organizations, which are making important contributions to realizing 
sexual and reproductive health rights, including for adolescents. 
</b></p>
<p>75. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur learned that some donors, including Sida, were 
discussing the establishment of a basket-fund (i.e. pooled funding) for health-focused CSOs. 
While the details were not finalized at the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, some CSOs 
were concerned that a basket-fund would jeopardize their funding. <b>If or when a basket-fund is 
established for health NGOs, this must not jeopardize Sida&#8217;s support for CSOs working on 
right to health issues, including those committed to sensitive initiatives, such as the 
provision of sexual and reproductive health information for adolescents. 
</b></p>
<p><i>Health professionals 
</i>76. While health professionals have a pivotal role to play in realizing the right to health, they 
require human rights training. The Ugandan Medical Association recently established a Health 
and Human Rights Committee that will examine the issue of human rights training for health 
professionals. Similarly, the Action Group for Health, Human Rights and HIV/AIDS recently 
co-organized an international training course on human rights for health professionals in 
Kampala. <b>The Special Rapporteur encourages Sweden and other development partners to 
support such initiatives. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Accountability for Sweden&#8217;s human rights responsibility of international assistance and 
cooperation in health 
</b></p>
<p>77. Accountability is a vital feature of human rights, including the right to health. In the 
development context, accountability has focused on recipient countries. Recipients have had to 
show that aid is spent as intended and with the desired outcomes. Such accountability is vitally 
important. However, the right to health (and other human rights) also demands the accountability </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/11/Add.2 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>of donors. Donors&#8217; accountability moves in two directions. Firstly, they are accountable to their 
taxpayers, usually through Parliament. Secondly, they are accountable to recipients and the 
international community. These paragraphs focus on donors&#8217; accountability to recipients. For 
recipients the key question is: has the donor honoured its pledges and policies? In other words, 
has the donor discharged its human rights responsibility of international assistance and 
cooperation in health? 
</p>
<p>78. In Uganda, many stakeholders - including the Government, international organizations, 
civil society and donors - impressed upon the Special Rapporteur how important it is that all duty 
bearers, including donors, are held to account in relation to their duties arising from the right to 
health. 
</p>
<p>79. Commendably, Sweden and some other donors have produced Millennium Development 
Goal Reports, highlighting how they are supporting the fulfilment of the Millennium 
Development Goals. The OECD Development Assistance Committee also has a peer review 
process that assesses the development policies and efforts of its members. The Paris Declaration 
on Aid Effectiveness enshrines a commitment to &#8220;mutual accountability&#8221;, in other words, a 
commitment to mutual assessment by donors and partners regarding implementation of agreed 
undertakings. The accountability of donors to the Governments of recipient countries is 
beginning to receive serious attention. 
</p>
<p>80. A lack of information about donors&#8217; policies and programmes, as well as a scarcity of 
accountability mechanisms, present significant obstacles to donors&#8217; accountability in Uganda. 
</p>
<p>81. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that Sida prepare and distribute accessible 
information about its programmes in Uganda and their implementation. Pamphlets in local 
languages could be made publicly available, and newspapers could be invited to carry 
articles and notices. The Special Rapporteur also recommends that Sida work with the 
Government of Uganda and other development partners to enhance public access to 
information on national health policies and processes, such as HSSPII and the JRMs, since 
these initiatives are vital vehicles for donors&#8217; international assistance and cooperation in 
health. 
</b></p>
<p>82. As well as access to information, appropriate mechanisms are required to hold Sida 
accountable. The following paragraphs signal a range of complementary mechanisms that may 
be developed to enhance the accountability of donors, such as Sida. 
</p>
<p>83. <i>Government</i>: Joint Review Missions (JRMs) annually assess the performance of the health 
sector. They also monitor implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding between the 
Government of Uganda and its health development partners. The Missions are composed of 
representatives from the Ugandan Government and its health development partners. The JRMs 
already provide an opportunity to assess and hold donors to account for their sectoral budget 
support. They could be developed to deepen donors&#8217; public accountability. 
</p>
<p>84. <i>Parliament</i>: The Ugandan Parliament could provide a forum to hold Sida accountable. The 
Sessional Committee on Social Services of the Ugandan Parliament is mandated to oversee the 
activities of the Ministry of Health, as well as other health-related government bodies, such as 
the Uganda AIDS Commission. This Committee could play a role in exercising parliamentary </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/11/Add.2 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>accountability not only for the performance of national ministries, but also for the support 
provided by health donors. The Swedish Ambassador, for example, could be invited to make a 
presentation to the Committee and answer questions. 
</p>
<p>85. <i>Uganda Human Rights Commission</i>: <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
Commission&#8217;s right-to-health unit monitor the policies of Uganda&#8217;s donors, as well as those 
of the national Government, with a view to deepening accountability. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <i>Civil society</i>: Sida should be encouraged to report to key civil society meetings. 
</p>
<p>87. <i>Multi-stakeholder forums</i>: The National Health Assembly meets every two years. A range 
of stakeholders attends: health-related ministries, local health authorities, parliamentarians, 
international organizations and civil society. The Assembly reviews health sector performance 
and strategizes about future work. With appropriate information, the Assembly could review 
donors&#8217; contributions to the realization of the right to health in Uganda. 
</p>
<p>88. <b>Sida should be accountable to Uganda for its initiatives that impact upon the health of 
the Ugandan people. The Special Rapporteur recommends that Sida, and others, actively 
seek practical, realistic ways to enhance accountability to the Ugandan Government, 
Parliament and public. For example, Sida could submit reports to a Committee of the 
Ugandan Parliament, as well as to the National Health Assembly. The Uganda Human 
Rights Commission could monitor Sida&#8217;s health-related initiatives. These and other 
possibilities - some of them signalled in the preceding paragraphs - should be actively 
explored in close consultation with the Government of Uganda. 
</b></p>
<p><b>V.  WORLD BANK AND THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
</b></p>
<p>89. The World Bank is a significant source of financial and technical assistance to developing 
countries. The institution provides low-interest loans and interest free credit and grants to 
support developing countries, including in relation to health. Poverty reduction is a central 
objective of the Bank. 
90. The mandate of the IMF includes the promotion of international monetary cooperation, 
fostering economic growth and high employment, and providing temporary financial assistance 
to countries to help ease balance-of-payments adjustments.<b>17</b> In recent years, IMF policies and 
activities have been adapted to support the context of poverty reduction policies in developing 
countries. 
</p>
<p>91. World Bank and IMF policies and programmes have sometimes a significant impact on the 
right to the highest attainable standard of health, in particular in low-income countries.<b>18</b> For 
instance under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative the World Bank and IMF

</p>
<p>provide concessional lending and debt relief to poor countries. To receive debt relief, countries 
must prepare a poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) for approval by the IMF and 
World Bank, who then periodically assess implementation. Most strategy papers include a 
multi-year budget projection called a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF), which 
includes spending targets for various sectors of the Government. While the HIPC provides 
debt relief to countries with unsustainable debt burdens, and thereby helps in accelerating 
progress towards the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals, in some countries 
health-spending targets identified in the MTEF have functioned, at least temporarily, as 
health-spending ceilings.<b>19</b>

<p>92. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s meetings with the Executive Directors representing Sweden at 
the IMF and World Bank provided him with an opportunity to discuss how Sweden is 
implementing its policies on health, development and human rights in the context of its 
membership of these institutions, as well as obstacles encountered. 
</p>
<p>93. In 2001, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights encouraged Sweden, as a 
member of international financial institutions, in particular the World Bank and IMF, to &#8220;do all it 
can to ensure that the policies and decisions of those Organizations are in conformity with the 
obligations of States parties to the Covenant, in particular the obligations contained in 
articles 2.1, 22 and 23 concerning international assistance and cooperation&#8221;.<b> 20</b> 
</p>
<p>94. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s meetings with the Executive Directors also provided him with an 
opportunity to discuss how Sweden is implementing the Committee&#8217;s recommendation. 
</p>
<p><b>A. Governance of the IMF and World Bank:  Sweden&#8217;s  
role and human rights responsibilities 
</b></p>
<p>95. The decision-making procedures of the IMF and World Bank have a significant bearing on 
Sweden&#8217;s opportunities to mainstream its international policies on development, health and 
human rights in the context of its membership of these organizations.  
</p>
<p><b>Boards of Governors 
</b></p>
<p>96. Both the World Bank and IMF are composed of 185 shareholding member States. The 
highest decision-making body of each institution is a Board of Governors, which consists of 
representatives from each shareholder&#8217;s Government. The Boards of Governors meet on an 
annual basis.

</p>
<p>97. The Minister for Finance represents Sweden on the World Bank Board of Governors, and 
Sweden&#8217;s Alternate Governor to the World Bank is the Minister for International Development 
Cooperation. The governor of the central bank in Sweden represents Sweden on the IMF Board 
of Governors, and Sweden&#8217;s Alternate Governor to the IMF is the State Secretary to the Minister 
for Finance. 
</p>
<p>98. <b>The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that Sweden&#8217;s representatives on the Boards of 
Governors should ensure that their votes and other activities are informed by Sweden&#8217;s 
international human rights obligations, including its human rights responsibility of 
international assistance and cooperation in health. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Executive Directors and Executive Boards 
</b></p>
<p>99. The Governors delegate responsibility for overseeing the day-to-day business of the 
institutions to their designated representatives on the World Bank and IMF Executive Boards. 
The Executive Boards for the World Bank and IMF are each made up of 24 Executive Directors 
representing the 185 member countries. 
</p>
<p>100. The Executive Directors are based in Washington and normally meet twice a week to 
oversee day-to-day business, including approving loans and guarantees, new policies, the 
administrative budget, country support strategies, and borrowing and financial decisions. Even 
though Executive Directors are accountable to the Governments which they represent, it is 
anticipated that they exercise their functions independently. 
</p>
<p>101. Sweden shares its representation on the Executive Board of the Bank and IMF with 
Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Norway. Mr. Svein Aass (Norway) is 
currently the Executive Director representing these countries on the Executive Board of the 
World Bank, and Mr. Tuomas Saarenheimo (Finland) is the incumbent Nordic-Baltic Executive 
Director at the IMF. Each Executive Director is supported by an Alternate Executive Director 
and a team of advisors from the member countries. 
</p>
<p>102. The decisions of the Executive Boards are, by and large, based on consensus. In situations 
where there is a conflict of views amongst the Executive Directors, the issue is decided by a 
simple majority of the voting power. Votes are weighted among the Executive Directors on the 
basis of the size of the shareholding of the countries that they represent. 
</p>
<p>103. As a rule, Executive Directors representing more than one country must cast a single block 
vote for the member countries that they represent. The joint voting share of Sweden and the other 
Nordic and Baltic countries on the Executive Board of the World Bank (International Bank of 
Reconstruction and Development) is 3.34 per cent of the total votes and 3.45 per cent of total 
votes on the Executive Board of the IMF. 
</p>
<p>104. The meetings that the Special Rapporteur held with the Executive Directors confirmed that 
support and political guidance from constituency countries play an important role in defining 
Nordic-Baltic policy positions in deliberations of the Executive Boards. However, since the 
decisions of the Boards are based on consensus, and the positions of individual Executive 
Directors or the countries that they represent are normally undisclosed, it is difficult to assess </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/11/Add.2 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p>Sweden&#8217;s impact on the overall decisions made by the Board. <b>The Special Rapporteur 
encourages Sweden to make publicly available the views and positions taken by its 
Executive Directors in Executive Board discussions. 
</b></p>
<p>105. In a move to create greater transparency and accountability, the Spanish Parliament has 
recently passed a motion requiring its World Bank and IMF Executive Directors to report 
annually to Parliament on the positions taken by them on behalf of Spain at the World Bank and 
IMF. <b>The Special Rapporteur encourages Sweden to establish a transparent, accessible and 
effective mechanism to monitor and hold to account their Executive Directors in respect of 
human rights and their functions at the World Bank and the IMF. 
</b></p>
<p>106. All the countries represented by the Nordic-Baltic Executive Directors have ratified 
ICESCR and CRC, and all therefore have a human rights responsibility of international 
assistance and cooperation in health. <b>The Government of Sweden should do all in its power to 
ensure that the positions taken by the Nordic-Baltic Executive Directors in Executive 
Board meetings promote policies and decisions that are in conformity with the obligations 
of States parties to ICESCR and CRC. The Special Rapporteur encourages other member 
countries of the Nordic and Baltic office to support Sweden in implementing human 
rights-based policies and programmes. 
</b></p>
<p><b>B.  Human rights and the World Bank and IMF:  institutional obstacles 
</b></p>
<p>107. While Sweden&#8217;s international policies on development, health and human rights are among 
the best of the world, there are some institutional barriers in the operationalization of these 
programmes and policies in the World Bank and the IMF. 
</p>
<p><b>The mandates of the World Bank and IMF to address human rights 
</b></p>
<p>108. Over the years, some senior World Bank and IMF staff have argued that their institutions 
have neither the mandate nor competence to address human rights issues. For instance, in 2001 
the IMF General Counsel Fran&#231;ois Gianviti, in an informal opinion, rejected the applicability of 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to the Fund on the grounds 
that the obligations imposed by the Covenant applied only to States, not to international 
organizations.<b>21</b> Regrettably, these views have tended to discourage other staff from examining 
the human rights dimensions of their work. 
</p>
<p>109. These views are being challenged from both within and outside these institutions. In a 
recent analysis it is argued that the IMF, as a subject of international law, has human rights 
obligations; economic, social and cultural rights are a part of general international law that is 
binding outside the treaty regimes and therefore create binding obligations for the IMF.<b>22</b>  
</p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/11/Add.2 
  page 23 
 
</p>
<p>110. Similarly, Roberto Danino, the then General Counsel of the World Bank, argued that the 
Bank&#8217;s objectives and activities are deeply supportive of human rights and that a more explicit 
approach to human rights is not only consistent with the organization&#8217;s Articles of Agreement, 
but is essential if the institution is to fulfil its poverty reduction mission of economic growth and 
social equity in a changing world.<b>23</b> More recently, the new World Bank General Counsel, 
Ana Palacio, also expressed support for the incorporation of human rights concepts into the work 
of the organization.<b>24</b> <b>The Special Rapporteur supports this view and encourages Sweden to 
use its influence on the Governing and Executive Boards of the World Bank and IMF to 
ensure that these institutions respect human rights in force in borrowing countries, and to 
promote and integrate human rights within their policies and programmes in accordance 
with their mandates. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Familiarity with human rights within the World Bank and the IMF 
</b></p>
<p>111. Certain institutional and cultural barriers within the World Bank and IMF impede the 
integration of human rights dimensions within their policies, programmes and projects.<b>25</b> For 
instance, the Bank and IMF primarily consist of economists and financial experts who specialize 
in lending techniques that can be measured quantitatively. This approach regards economic and 
financial variables as the ones that matter and largely ignores their critically important social 
context. In addition the &#8220;approval culture&#8221; in the Bank reflects an emphasis on the approval of 
large projects with large amounts to the neglect of negative environmental and social impacts of 
these projects.<b>26</b>  
112. Another obstacle in the development of human rights policies and programmes within the 
Bank and IMF is the lack of human rights training opportunities for the staff, as well as the 
members of the Executive Boards of these organizations. The lack of understanding of human 
rights contributes to internal resistance in the Executive Board to the application of human rights 
in these institutions.<b>27</b> As a result, human right concerns are not adequately considered by the 
Executive Board. Even when they are, their scope is generally limited to civil and political rights 
only.

<p>113. <b>The Special Rapporteur encourages Sweden to provide its Executive Directors, as 
well as other staff in the Nordic and Baltic office, with human rights training, resources 
and advice. He also calls on the Government of Sweden and Sweden&#8217;s Executive Directors 
to support the provision of human rights training for other World Bank and IMF 
Executive Directors and the staff in their respective offices, and staff working in the 
World Bank and IMF themselves.  
</b></p>
<p><b>The Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness 
</b></p>
<p>114. The World Bank and many of its members, including Sweden, are signatories to the Paris 
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. As the Special Rapporteur has already emphasized, there is 
significant potential for mutual reinforcement between human rights and the Paris Declaration. 
However, a restrictive interpretation of the Paris commitments to national ownership, alignment 
and harmonization, whereby progressive policies are watered down to a &#8220;lowest common 
denominator&#8221;, could obstruct promotion and protection of the right to health in the context of the 
Bank&#8217;s operations.  
</p>
<p>115. Similarly, &#8220;new aid modalities&#8221; are often interpreted as leading towards a diminishing 
support for CSOs. CSOs play an important role in the promotion and protection of human rights 
and in ensuring donor accountability. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls upon Sweden to ensure 
that &#8220;new aid modalities&#8221; do not lead to diminishing support for CSOs.  
</b></p>
<p>116. The &#8220;managing for results&#8221; requirement under the Paris Declaration is about promoting a 
results-oriented approach in aid relationships. Human rights should be used to define the results 
to be achieved and the strategies needed to achieve them. 
</p>
<p>117. <b>The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government of Sweden to ensure that its 
Executive Directors and Governors support the right to health in the contexts of 
national ownership, alignment, harmonization, managing for results and mutual 
accountability. In other words, they should ensure that the Bank supports countries to 
realize their right-to-health commitments, and that Bank policies and strategies are also 
supportive of the right to health.  
</b></p>
<p>118. Along these lines, the Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn that the Nordic-Baltic 
Executive Directors, and several other Executive Directors, recently acted to ensure that the 
Bank&#8217;s Strategy for Health, Nutrition and Population (2007) incorporated sexual and 
reproductive health and rights, issues which had been marginalized in the earlier draft strategy. 
</p>
<p><b>Unequal representation on the Executive Boards 
</b></p>
<p>119. The programmes and policies of the World Bank and the IMF affect the lives of people 
living in developing countries in many ways. However, decision-making in respect of these 
programmes and policies often fails to take into account particular circumstances existing in 
these countries. Unequal representation of developing countries on the Executive Boards could 
be seen as one of the reasons for such a failure. For instance, while Sweden has 1.09 per cent of 
the total voting power on the Executive Board of the IMF, Mozambique has only 0.06 per cent.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/11/Add.2 
  page 25 
 
</p>
<p>120. There is a need to strengthen the voice of developing countries in decision-making 
processes. There is therefore a need to make the process more democratic and transparent by 
giving equal voice to developing country members, in terms of both their voting capacity and 
their membership on the Board. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that Sweden support 
the development of more democratic decision-making structures on the Executive Boards 
of the World Bank and the IMF. 
</b></p>
<p><b>C.  Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>121. To take the human rights agenda forward in the World Bank, Sweden and the other 
Nordic countries have proposed a trust fund for justice and human rights in this institution for a 
five-year period.  
</p>
<p>122. Initially, the proposed fund will finance capacity-building for World Bank staff on human 
rights issues, selected pilot projects linked to the national Poverty Reduction Strategies and the 
development of indicators for efficient human rights and justice programmes. In addition, it will 
contribute to promoting the participation of the World Bank in donor coherence dialogues on 
human rights and related issues. 
</p>
<p>123. The Nordic fund aims to enhance the World Bank&#8217;s capacity to undertake human rights 
analysis. It also aims to support the Bank&#8217;s launch of some pilot projects to test the relationship 
between human rights, democratic processes and poverty reduction. <b>The Special Rapporteur 
warmly commends all those involved in this initiative and encourages them to work 
towards implementing this proposal, and to develop a similar fund for building the 
capacity of the IMF on human rights issues.  
</b></p>
<p>124. The activities of the World Bank and IMF affect human rights outcomes in developing 
countries in positive and negative ways. Their policies and programmes can reinforce societal 
divisions and exacerbate conflict if issues such as race, ethnicity and gender are not taken into 
consideration. The World Bank and IMF should therefore promote human rights, equity and 
social inclusion in their policies and programming. <b>The Special Rapporteur encourages 
Sweden to work with other members of the World Bank and IMF to ensure that human 
rights are integrated in the policies and programmes of these institutions.  
</b></p>
<p>125. In the longer term, the Special Rapporteur considers that there is a need for the IMF and 
the World Bank to adopt human rights policies. This would give greater legitimacy to difficult 
and contested policy choices, and strengthen policy coherence and coordination among donors. 
<b>The Special Rapporteur encourages Sweden to work proactively with other members of the 
World Bank and IMF to support the development of human rights policies for these 
organizations. 
</b></p>
<p>126. <b>The policy decisions taken by the Executive Directors are dependent on the guidance 
received from the countries they represent. In this regard the Special Rapporteur calls on 
Sweden to ensure that in its interactions with the Executive Directors, economic, social and 
cultural rights, such as the rights to health, housing, food and education, are given due 
consideration.  </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/7/11/Add.2 
page 26 
 
</p>
<p>127. The Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) annually assesses the quality of 
IBRD and IDA borrowers&#8217; policy and institutional performance in areas relevant to economic 
growth and poverty reduction. In the past the CPIA process has privileged a limited category of 
rights. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls on Sweden to ensure that economic, social and cultural 
rights are given due consideration in the CPIA. 
</b></p>
<p>128. <b>At present, there is a fragile link between the World Bank and the IMF and the 
people that are affected by their operations. The only formal recourse available to a 
recipient country to express its discontent in relation to a particular programme or policy 
is at the annual meeting of the Board. The Special Rapporteur encourages staff and 
members of the Nordic-Baltic office representing Sweden to use these meetings as an 
opportunity to ascertain and take on board the developing country perspectives on their 
programmes and policies. 
</b></p>
<p>129. <b>The Special Rapporteur encourages Executive Directors representing Sweden at the 
World Bank and the IMF to devise mechanisms to deepen their dialogue with all 
stakeholders in developing countries. For example, they should engage with CSOs at both 
global and national levels. Further, they should consider developing accountability 
arrangements comparable to those outlined in paragraphs 76 to 87. 
</b></p>
<p><b>VI.  CONCLUSION 
</b></p>
<p>130. <b>This report has taken a practical, specific and detailed approach with a view to 
exploring the scope of the human rights responsibility of international assistance and 
cooperation in health. In conclusion, however, a few words are needed about one 
fundamental legal issue. 
</b></p>
<p>131. <b>Throughout his mandate, the Special Rapporteur has taken the position that the 
human rights responsibility of international assistance and cooperation is underpinned by 
legal obligation. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and others, 
adopt the same position. The legal obligation can be traced from the Charter of the 
United Nations, through to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and binding human 
rights treaties, such as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities. 
</b></p>
<p>132. <b>Sweden does not accept that it has a legal obligation of international assistance and 
cooperation. While other high-income States share Sweden&#8217;s view, middle-income and 
low-income countries disagree. 
</b></p>
<p>133. <b>However, if there is no legal obligation underpinning the human rights responsibility 
of international assistance and cooperation, inescapably all international assistance and 
cooperation fundamentally rests upon charity. While such a position might have been 
tenable in years gone by, it is unacceptable in the twenty-first century. </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/11/Add.2 
  page 27 
 
</p>
<p>134. <b>From the right-to-health perspective, Sweden&#8217;s international policies on development, 
health and human rights are among the best in the world. Generally, Sweden provides very 
significant support for developing States. While there is scope for improvement, Sida&#8217;s 
programmes in Uganda are broadly consistent with Sweden&#8217;s human rights responsibility 
of international assistance and cooperation in health. 
</b></p>
<p>135. <b>Recognition of a legal obligation underpinning its human rights responsibility of 
international assistance and cooperation in health would primarily serve to reinforce 
Sweden&#8217;s existing international policies and practices. For a country with Sweden&#8217;s 
commendable record, recognition of a legal obligation would not demand a significantly 
different approach. Accordingly, the Special Rapporteur encourages Sweden to play a 
leading role in exploring the contours, content and legal nature of the human rights 
responsibility of international assistance and cooperation.
