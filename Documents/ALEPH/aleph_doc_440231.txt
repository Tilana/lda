1  Summary
1.1  Introduction 
The purpose of this technical report is to support the mineral resource estimate released July 31st, 2015 in 
accordance  with  the  guidelines  of  National  Instrument  43-101.  This  report  updates  and  supersedes  the 
previous mineral resource estimate (Davis et al., 2014) based on  additional data from the Phase IV drill 
program.  The  mineral  resource  estimate  in  this  Technical  Report  represents  a  substantial  change  from 
the  previous  estimate  (Davis  et  al.,  2014)  which  was  used  as  the  basis  for  the  updated  Preliminary 
Economic Assessment (“PEA”) detailed in the Technical Report dated February 13, 2015 (Kuchling et al., 
2015). Hence, that PEA is no longer current and will not be carried forward.
The mineral resource estimate and associated information in this report was prepared under the direction 
of Robert Sim, P.Geo, SIM Geological Inc. (SGI), Bruce Davis, FAusIMM, BD Resource Consulting, Inc. 
and  Bruce  Smith,  MAusIMM  CP(Geo).  Based  on  education,  work  experience  relevant  to  this  style  of 
mineralization and deposit type, and membership in a recognized professional organization, both Mr. Sim 
and Mr. Davis are independent Qualified Persons (“QP”) and Mr. Smith is a non-independent QP, within 
the requirements of NI 43-101 for the purpose of the report.
1.2  Project Description
The Chinchillas Project is located in the Puna region of northwestern Argentina, in the province of Jujuy, 
department  of  Rinconada,  approximately  280  kilometres  from  the  provincial  capital  of  San  Salvador  de 
Jujuy.
The  Project  is  composed  of  three  contiguous  claims,  totaling  2,043  hectares.    Golden  Arrow  holds  a 
100% interest in the claims, with a commitment for a $1.2M payment to the vendors of the Chinchilla and 
Chinchilla I Minas upon the commencement of commercial production.
Access to the Chinchillas Project is by paved road to the town of Abra Pampa via National Route No. 9 
and  then  66  kilometres  west  across  public  gravel  roads,  through  the  village  of  Santo  Domingo.  Santo 
Domingo is  equipped  with  electricity,  natural  gas,  and  water  services.  Abra  Pampa  has  a hospital,  and, 
along with San Salvador, provides other supplies necessary for exploration.
The  topography  of  the  Project  area  is  large  rounded  hills  surrounding  an  elliptical  depression,  with  an 
altitude ranging from 4,000 to 4,200 masl.
1.3  History
The Chinchillas Project area was first prospected and mined on a small scale in the eighteenth century by 
Jesuit missionaries and, in the late 1960’s, there was a period of small underground production by a local 
company  using  adits  and  tunnels.  In  1994,  Aranlee  Resources  conducted  surface  sampling  and  drilled 
seven reverse circulation drill holes for a total of 780 metres.  Silex Argentina, a subsidiary of Apex Silver, 
acquired the property  and began exploration in 2004.  Silex completed 2,220 metres of drilling in seven 
holes.
In  early  2011  Golden  Arrow  personnel  identified  the  Chinchillas  Project  as  a  potential  advanced-stage 
acquisition  target.  The  Company  completed  an  option  agreement  with  the  underlying  landowners  in 
August  of  the  same  year.      Exploration  work  commenced  in  the  spring  of  2012  following  community 
relations  meetings  and  approval  of  work  permits.  Golden  Arrow  has  since  completed  four  phases  of 
exploration and drilling and published four Technical Reports detailing resource estimates and preliminary 
economic assessments, all of which are filed on SEDAR.

1.4  Geological Setting and Mineralization
The  Chinchillas  silver-lead-zinc  deposit  is  located  in  the  Puna  geological  belt.  Stratigraphy  in  the  belt 
includes  metamorphosed  Proterozoic  sediments  in  the  basement,  through  Paleozoic  marine  back-arc 
sediments,  to  more  recent  volcanic  sequences  and  continental  sediments.  The  Puna  is  the  most 
important terrane in Jujuy Province for mineral deposits, including: mesothermal quartz veins with native 
gold  and  base  metals;  polymetallic  quartz-sulphide  veins  with  base  and  precious  metals;  gold,  tin  and 
copper placer  deposits;  SEDEX deposits  with lead-zinc-silver  and; Bolivian-type tin-silver sulphide  veins 
related to intrusive stocks.
The Chinchillas deposit is located in a dacitic volcanic centre. The deposit formed at a dilational fault jog 
within a regional scale east-west trending fault structure where an explosive volcanic vent has cut through 
marine  meta-sedimentary  basement  rocks.    The  resulting  topographic  depression  or  diatreme  volcanic 
throat  is  elliptical  in  shape,  approximately  two  kilometres  long  by  1.6  kilometres  wide,  and  infilled  with 
pyroclastic  rocks  (breccias  and  tuffs).  At  the  contact  between  pyroclastic  volcanics  and  basement 
metasediments, a wide zone of hydraulic fracturing and brecciation of the basement has formed.  Dacite 
dome  lavas  and  subvolcanics  intrude  on  the  southern  margin  of  the  basin  at  the  contact  between 
metasediments and pyroclastics.
The  Chinchillas  deposit  has  significant  silver-lead-zinc  mineralization  in  four  main  areas:  the  Silver 
Mantos  and  Mantos  Basement  zones  in  the  west  part  of  the  project,  and  the  Socavon  del  Diablo  and 
Socavon Basement zones in the east part.
The Silver Mantos zone is situated in the western third of the basin, covering an area of approximately 30 
hectares.  Shallow  disseminated  silver  mineralization  occurs  within  clay  altered  pyroclastic  breccias  and 
tuffs. This is concentrated in layers or “mantos” that average greater than 20 metres in thickness and  are 
generally situated  between the surface and 100 metres depth.   A significant  new mantos  zone has also 
been defined between 170 and 230 metres depth, and it remains open to expansion.
Located below  the  Silver  Mantos,  the  Mantos  Basement  comprises  an  area  320  metres  wide and up  to 
120 metres thick, with an average thickness of 80 metres.  It is hosted entirely within the basement pelites 
and sandstones and  is comprised predominantly  of breccias, crackle breccias  with minor small  veinlets, 
fracture  filling  and  mineralized  structures.  Mineralization  within  the  Mantos  Basement  is  open  to 
expansion downdip in some areas to the east and south.
The Socavon del Diablo zone is situated in the eastern third of the basin and defined by drilling over an 
area of approximately five hectares. Mineralization is generally lower in silver content and higher in zinc 
grade, and is dominated by manto-style disseminated sulphides within favorable shallow dipping volcanic 
tuff horizons.
The  Socavon  Basement  zone  is  mainly  hosted  within  the  Ordovician  interbedded  pelite  and  sandstone 
basement,  situated  to  the  northeast  of  the  main  Socavon  zone.  Immediately  to  the  east  of  the  dacite 
dome that limits the Socavon, biotitic horizontal tuffs are covering the newly discovered south expansion 
of  the  Socavon  Basement  zone.  Here,  the  mineralization  is  hosted  in  open  space  breccias  filled  with 
argentiferous  galena plus  a stockworking  of  sphalerite-siderite-galena  which in  places  carries  low  grade 
silver-zinc mineralization along widths of over 300 metres.
1.5  Deposit Types
The  Chinchillas  deposit  is  considered to  be  part  of  the Bolivian  tin-silver-zinc  belt  that  extends  from  the 
San  Rafael  tin-copper  deposit  in  southern  Peru  into  the  Puna  region  of  Jujuy.    Deposits  with  similar 
environments and styles of mineralization include San Cristóbal, Potosí, Pulacayo and Pirquitas.
Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Page | 2
These  deposits  are  generally  characterized  by  intrusion  of  dacite  dome  complexes  with  mineralization 
hosted in shears and breccias within the dacite domes and / or within shears and breccias within the host 
rocks.    More  rarely,  as  in  the  case  of  Chinchillas  and  San  Cristóbal,  the  deposits  also  contain 
disseminated  flat lying manto  bodies  within sediments  and pyroclastic  rocks  that  are  cut by  the  “feeder” 
shears. All the deposits are known to have large vertical extents.
1.6  Exploration and Drilling
Golden Arrow’s surface exploration program in 2011 and 2012 included detailed mapping with a special 
emphasis on structures, rock chip sampling, trenching and talus sampling.  These programs identified the 
major  structural  zones,  the  strong  east-west  control  on  basin  formation,  and  new  mineralized  target 
areas.   These interpretations defined drill targets for the Phase I and Phase II drill  programs.   In 2013 
the Company completed geophysical surveys (IP/Resistivity, CSAMT, Magnetics) and a re-interpretation 
of the 2008 IP as well as collected 453 soil samples and 174 rock chip samples in a surface exploration 
program.        The  work  resulted  in  the  identification  of  new  structural  zones  and  areas  of  mineralization 
around  the  existing  deposit,  and  the  identification  of  a  new  target  area  to  the  south,  called  Chinchillas 
South.
Golden Arrow has completed four drilling programs.  The first drilling phase, conducted in May and June 
2012,  included  27  drill  holes  for  3,224  metres  of  drilling.    The  second,  conducted  between  November 
2012  and  February  2013,  included  49  drill  holes  and  7,278  metres  of  drilling.    Between  February  24th 
2014 and June 17th 2014, Golden Arrow completed a Phase III drill program including 38 drill holes and 
8,985 metres.  The most recent drilling was the Phase IV program, conducted between November 2014 
and April 2015, which included 55 drill holes with 11,175 metres length.
Prior to Golden Arrow’s work, Silex Argentina S.A.  drilled seven core holes on the property for a total of 
2,220  metres.      Therefore  the  drill  database  supplied  by  Golden  Arrow  contains  176  core  drill  holes 
representing a total of 32,881 metres.
No other type of drilling or surface sampling was used in the resource estimate.
1.7  Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security
All drilling was completed by professional drilling companies using standard industry methods.
The database from Silex lacks results from several certified reference materials (CRMs or standards), but 
re-sampling  work  conducted  by  Golden  Arrow  validates  the  Silex  data  and  the  results  have  been 
incorporated into the resource database.
Sample  and  assay  procedures  applied  by  Golden  Arrow  in  the  drilling  program  are  consistent  with 
generally  accepted  industry  best  practices.  The  statistical  analysis  of  quality  control  data  show  good 
accuracy and precision with no significant contamination. It is the opinion of the authors that the data are 
suitable for the estimation of resources.
1.8  Data Verification
No  material  sample  bias  was  identified  by  the  QPs  during  the  review  of  the  drill  data  and  assays. 
Observation  of  the  drill  core  during  the  site  visits  and  inspection  and  validation  of  the  data  collected 
convinced the QP’s that the drill data are adequate for the estimation of Inferred and Indicated resources.
1.9  Metallurgy
A metallurgical test program was initiated in January 2013 and continued in stages, with the most recent 
work completed in July 2014.  The test work is undertaken by Bureau Veritas Commodities Canada Ltd.,
Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project

The metallurgical test work program will continue as the project progresses, and in the future will include 
samples  from  the  Socavon  Basement.  For  the  purposes  of  this  resource  estimate  the  metallurgical 
parameters  and  recoveries  for  the  Socavon  Basement  are  assumed  to  be  the  same  as  the  Mantos 
Basement, based on similarities in geology and mineralization.
1.10  Resource Estimate
The  mineral  resource  has  been  estimated  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  CIM  Estimation  of 
Mineral  Resources  and  Mineral  Reserves  Best  Practices  Guidelines  (November,  2003)  and  reported 
according  to the  CIM Definition  Standards  for  Mineral  Resources  and Mineral  Reserves,  (CIM,  2014)  in 
accordance with the Canadian Securities Administrators’ (CSA) National Instrument 43-101 (“NI 43-101”) 
(CSA, 2011).
Estimations  were  made  from  3D  block  models  based  on  geostatistical  applications  using  commercial 
mine  planning  software  (MineSight®  v10.0-2).    The  model  uses  a  nominal  block  size  of  10  x  10  x  5  m 
(LxWxH).
The resource estimate has been generated from drill hole sample assay results and the interpretation of a 
geologic  model  which  relates  to  the  spatial  distribution  of  silver,  lead  and  zinc.  Interpolation 
characteristics  were  defined  based  on  the  geology,  drill  hole  spacing,  and  geostatistical  analysis  of  the 
data.  The resources were classified according to their proximity to sample data locations.
Table 1-2 summarizes the estimate of Mineral Resources for the Chinchillas Project.
Mineral  resources,  which  are  not  mineral  reserves,  do  not  have  demonstrated  economic  viability.  The 
estimate  of  mineral  resources  may  be  materially  affected  by  environmental,  permitting,  legal,  title,
Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Page | 4
taxation,  sociopolitical,  marketing,  or  other  relevant  issues.  The  quantity  and  grade  of  reported  Inferred 
resources  are  uncertain  in  nature  and  there  has  been  insufficient  exploration  to  classify  these  Inferred 
resources as Indicated or Measured, and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them 
to an Indicated or Measured category.
Due  to  the  polymetallic  nature  of  the  deposit,  mineral  resources  were  calculated  on  a  silver-equivalent 
basis  (AgEq)  using  the  formula:  AgEq  =  Ag  g/t  +  (Pb%  ∗  36.09)  +  (Zn%  *  36.09).  Silver  equivalents 
(AgEq)  are  calculated  in  model  blocks,  for  use  in  the  floating  cone  algorithm,  using  the  contributions  of 
silver,  lead  and  zinc  and  include  adjustments  for metallurgical  recoveries.  There are  no  adjustments  for 
mining  losses  or  dilution.  Since  this  is  a  resource  limiting  pit  shell,  and  the  fact  that  mineral  resources 
must  show  reasonable  prospects  for  eventual  economic  extraction,  an  elevated  silver  price  of  $25  per 
ounce was used to generate the pit shell.
The following technical and economic parameters were used (all prices are in US dollars):
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Metal prices for Silver Equivalent calculation: silver $19/oz, lead $1/lb, zinc $1/lb
Metal price used to generate resource limiting pit shell: silver $25/oz
Recoveries: 90% silver equivalent.
Mining cost: $2.45/t
Process cost: $16/t
General and Adminstrative (“G&A"): $8.30/t
Pit slope: 45 degrees
Based  on  a  $19/oz  silver  price,  the  base  cut-off  grade  for  the  resource  is  estimated  to  be  45  g/t  silver 
equivalent.

Notes to Table 1-2:
Totals may not add correctly due to rounding
 
  Mineral resources are contained within a pit shell generated using a silver price of $25/oz. 
  Silver  equivalent  grades,  and  the  base  case  cut-off  grade  of  45g/t  AgEq,  are  based  on  metal  prices  of
$19/oz silver and $1/lb for Lead and Zinc.
  Mineral resources, which are not mineral reserves, do not have demonstrated economic viability.  

The quantity and grade of reported Inferred resources are uncertain in nature and there has been insufficient 
exploration  to  classify  these  Inferred  resources  as  Indicated  or  Measured,  and  it  is  uncertain  if  further 
exploration will result in upgrading them to an Indicated or Measured category.
1.11  Conclusions and Recommendations
There is a good understanding of the geology and mineralization of the deposit, and the resource model 
is a reasonable reflection of deposit geology.  Exploration activities have been carried out in accordance 
with  industry  standard  best  practices  and  are  suitable  to  support  resource  estimates.  Sampling  and 
assaying include appropriate quality assurance and control procedures.  The resource model developed 
for the Chinchillas deposit uses accepted modeling and grade estimation methods.
The  estimated  Indicated  resource,  using  a  cut-off  grade  of  45  g/t  of  equivalent  silver,  is  25.9  Mt  with 
grades of 77.2 g/t silver, 0.66% lead, and 0.66% zinc. A further Inferred resource of 47.1 Mt, with grades 
of 50.2 g/t silver, 0.52% lead, and 0.64% zinc, has been estimated using the same cut-off grade.
Potential remains to expand the current resource and to define new resources.  This expanded resource 
estimate  and  recent  metallurgical  testing  warrants  updating  the  economic  study  for  the  Chinchillas 
deposit.  A  further  economic  evaluation  beyond  a  PEA  level  study,  such  as  a  Feasibility  Study  (“FS”)  or 
Pre-Feasibility  Study  (“PFS”),  will  require  upgrading  of  the  resource categories.   Additional metallurgical 
testing will be required to confirm the optimum processing for all mineralization types.
A  further  10,000  metres  of  infill  drilling  is  recommended  to  upgrade  resources  from  the  Inferred  to 
Indicated  categories.  In  addition,  in  preparation  for  a  Feasibility  Study,  the  authors  recommend  5,000 
metres  of  condemnation,  metallurgical,  geotechnical  and  hydrogeological  drilling  and  additional  detailed 
metallurgical  testing.    The  estimated  budget  for  these  items  including  the  infill  drill  program  is  $4.8M.  
Golden Arrow should also continue its social and environmental programs and initiate the mine permitting 
process.

Introduction
2.1  Introduction and Terms of Reference
Golden Arrow  Resources  Corporation  (“Golden  Arrow”)  is  a Vancouver-based exploration company  that 
trades on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol GRG.  The Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project 
(“Chinchillas”  or  “the  Project”)  in  Jujuy  Province,  Argentina,  is  the  flagship  project  for  the  Company.   
Golden  Arrow  is  a  member  of  the  Grosso  Group:  a  management  company  specialized  in  resource 
exploration in Argentina since 1993.
Golden  Arrow  commissioned  independent  consultants  Bruce  Davis,  Ph.D.,  F.AusIMM  of  BD  Resource 
Consulting Inc.  and  Robert  Sim,  P.Geo., of  SIM Geological  Inc.,  and  non-independent consultant Bruce 
Smith,  MSc,  Chartered  Professional  Geologist,  MAusIMM,  to  provide  an  updated  mineral  resource 
estimate  for  the  Chinchillas  Project.    Dr.  Davis,  Mr.  Sim  and  Mr.  Smith  are  qualified  persons  within  the 
meaning  of  Canadian  Securities  Administrator’s  National  Instrument  43-101  Standards  of  Disclosure  for 
Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”) and Form 43-101F. The scope of work consisted of auditing the database, 
including  aspects  of  data  quality,  review  of  the  geologic  model,  development  of  a  block  model,  and 
determination  of  reasonable  prospects  for  eventual  economic  extraction  of  the  mineral  resources  in  the 
Project,  in  accordance  to  the  CIM  Definition  Standards  for  Mineral  Resources  and  Mineral  Reserves, 
(CIM,  2014).  Dr.  Davis  conducted  geostatistical  analysis  of  the  drill  data  and  directed  and  validated  the 
grade estimation in the block model. Mr. Sim constructed the resource model, and Mr. Smith provided the 
geological interpretation.
The purpose of this technical report is to support the mineral resource estimate released July 31st, 2015 in 
accordance  with  the  guidelines  of  National  Instrument  43-101.  This  report  updates  and  supersedes  the 
previous mineral resource estimate (Davis et al., 2014) based on  additional data from the Phase IV drill 
program.
The mineral resource estimate in this Technical Report represents a substantial change from the previous 
estimate  (Davis  et  al.,  2014)  which  was  used  as  the  basis  for  the  updated  Preliminary  Economic 
Assessment  (“PEA”)  detailed  in  the  Technical  Report  dated  February  13,  2015  (Kuchling  et  al.,  2015). 
Hence, that PEA is no longer current and will not be carried forward.

4  Property Description and Location
4.1  Location
The Chinchillas Project is located in the Puna region of northwestern Argentina, in the province of Jujuy, 
department  of  Rinconada,  approximately  280  kilometres  from  the  provincial  capital  of  San  Salvador  de 
Jujuy.    The  property  is  centred  at  approximately  at  3,473,150E  and  7,512,360N  (Gauss  Kruger, 
Argentina, Posgar Zone 3; 22⁰30′13″ S, 66°15′39″ W) at elevations ranging from 4,000 to 4,200 masl.
Figure 4-1: Location of the Chinchillas Project and Other Projects and Mines in the District.
The  Chinchillas  Project  is  located  within  the  Bolivian  tin-silver-lead-zinc  belt  (Figure  4-1)  which  extends 
into  northern  Argentina.  Similar  projects  in  the  district  include  Silver  Standard  Resources  Inc.'s  Mina 
Pirquitas,  located  approximately  30  kilometres  southwest  of  Chinchillas,  and  Sumitomo’s  San  Cristobal 
Mine in Bolivia.
4.2  Land Tenure
4.2.1  Exploitation Concessions
Exploitation  concessions  in  Argentina  are  called “Minas”.  Minas  are  defined  by  the  following categories: 
First  Category  Minas  include  substances  such  as  gold,  silver,  platinum,  iron,  lead,  copper,  zinc, 
aluminium,  lithium,  potassium,  etc.  and  Second Category  Minas  comprise substances  such as  precious 
stones in river beds, any metal not included in the first category and others.
Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Page | 10
The Mina is comprised of one or more “pertenencias” which are units of mining properties. Pertenencias 
must  be  rectangular  in  shape.  In  disseminated  deposits  such  as  Chinchillas,  the  pertenencias  can 
encompass  up  to  100  hectares.  The  mining  property  fee  or  “canon”  for  a  Mina  is  ARS$3,200  per 
pertenencia per year.
Individuals are entitled to explore for, exploit and dispose of Minas as owners by means of a legal licence 
or  legal  concession  granted  by  the  competent  authority  under  the  provisions  of  the  Argentine  Mining 
Code. The legal concessions granted for the exploitation of Minas are valid for an undetermined period of 
time,  and  are  considered  “real  property”  giving  the  concessionaire  the  right  to  recover  metals  from  the 
subsurface  vertically  underneath  the  concession,  provided  that  the  title  holder  complies  with  the 
obligations set out in the Argentine Mining Code.
The  Chinchillas  Project  consists  of  three  contiguous  First  Category  Minas  that  cover  an  area  of 
approximately 2,042.56 hectares (See Figure 4-2):

The Chinchilla Mina is broken down into four pertenencias, while the Chinchilla I Mina has 9 pertenencias 
and Chinchilla II has 9 pertenencias.  All Minas are valid and in good standing.
4.2.2  Option Agreement
As  of  July  2015,  the  Company,  through  its  wholly-owned  Argentine  subsidiary,  Valle  del  Cura  S.A., 
(“VDC”)  has  completed  option  payments  to  earn  a  100%  interest  in  the  Chinchilla  and  Chinchilla  I 
properties, to a total of US$1,866,000 paid.
The  Company  must  make  an  additional  payment  of  US$1,200,000  to  the  vendors  upon  the 
commencement of commercial production on these two properties.
The Chinchilla II Mina was acquired directly by VDC and is not subject to option payments.

4.4  Environmental liabilities
Prior  to  initiating  work  on  the  Chinchilla  Mina,  an  inspection  was  performed  by  the  mining  and 
environmental authorities regarding potential pre-existing environmental liabilities. There are remnants of 
historic mining activities in the Project area, such as small buildings, small areas of workings excavated in 
the  1960`s,  historic  drilling  platforms,  trenches  and  holes.  All  of  these  liabilities  were  declared  as  pre-
existing in the Company`s Environmental Impact Assessment report (“EIA”) for the Chinchilla Mina, there 
were  no  findings  and/or  requests  by  the  environmental  authorities,  and  the  Chinchilla  EIA  report  was 
approved.
4.5  Factors and risks
To  the  extent  known,  there  are  no  additional  factors  or  risks  that  may  affect  the  access,  title,  right  or 
ability to perform work on the Chinchillas Project.

5  Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography
The Chinchillas Project  is  accessed primarily by National Route No. 9 from the provincial capital  of San 
Salvador  de  Jujuy,  northwards  along  the  Humahuaca  River  to  the  town  of  Abra  Pampa.  The  route 
continues along Provincial Route No. 7 westward for 66 kilometres, through the village of Santo Domingo. 
The roads are maintained by the Province and are accessible year round. Several temporary rivers cross 
the route so four wheel drive vehicles are recommended in the rainy season.
A  second route  to the  Project  is  more  appropriate  for  heavy  transport  vehicles,  and is  used by  traffic  to 
the  Pirquitas  mine  situated  30  kilometres  to  the  southwest  of  Chinchillas.  This  route  follows  National 
Route No. 9 northwards from San Salvador de Jujuy to Purmamarca, then turns northwest on paved road 
No. 52 to the town of Susques. From there, National Route No. 40 heads to Provincial Route No. 70 that 
leads to the Project at the Fundiciones mountain pass (Figure 5-1).
Figure 5-1: Location Map with Access Routes to the Project Area.
5.1  Physiography, Climate and Vegetation
The  Chinchillas  Project  area  has  an  elliptical,  caldera-like  shape  with  steep  rolling  hills  surrounding  the 
caldera depression. It is located near the Fundiciones mountain pass, with the Rinconada and Carahuasi 
ranges  extending  from  north  to  south.  Elevations  range  from  about  4,000  to  4,200  masl.  The  highest 
elevation in the area is Cerro Granada (5,696 masl) 28 kilometres to the southwest.
The  climate  is  arid  to  semi-arid,  tropical-subtropical  influenced  by  high  desert  (Blasco,  2011).  Rain  is 
scarce and mainly occurs during the rainy season (November – March), with a mean precipitation of 300 
millimetres per annum. The annual mean temperature is 18°C, however during the winter it ranges from 
-7.7 ºC to 7.5 ºC. Dry and windy conditions often prevail in the area.
Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Page | 14
The  Uquillayoc  river  runs  through the  Project  area, and  is  fed  by  many  tributaries. Water  volume in the 
Uquillayoc is sufficient to be the main source of water for the village of Santo Domingo (Blasco, 2011).
Vegetation  is  patchy  to  sparse  and  consists  of  xerophilous  and  steppe  bushes  like  iro  (Festuca 
ortophylia),  and  coirón  (Stipachrysophylla).  Acantoliphia  haustata  is  the  predominant  species  with  the 
Yareta  (Azorella  compacta),  less  frequent.  The  tola  (Parastrepia  ssp)  and  small  trees  like  the  queñoa 
(Polylepis tomentella) can be found in depressions (Blasco, 2011).
Animal species found in the area include mammals such as llamas, puna foxes and vizcachas, as well as 
several  mice species,  chinchillas  and ferrets.  Other  fauna  in the  area  include lizards,  and birds  such as 
small rheas, owls, ducks, condors and falcons (Blasco, 2011).
5.2  Local resources and infrastructure
Chinchillas  is  located  in  the  rural  zone  of  Rinconada  department.  Rinconada  has  an  approximate 
population  of  2,500  people.  It  covers  an  area  of  6,407  square  kilometres  and  has  basic  public  services 
including  a  police  department  and  health  center.  The  main  communities  in  the  department  are:  Pan  de 
Azúcar,  Nuevo  Pirquitas,  Antiguyo,  Carahuasi,  Casa  Colorada,  Casti,  Ciénaga  Grande,  Cincel,  Rosario 
de  Coyaguayma,  Esquina  Blanca,  Laguna  Larga,  Lagunillas  de  Pozuelos,  Lagunita,  Loma  Blanca, 
Orosmayo,  Liviara,  Tiomayo,  Ojo  de  Agua,  Pozuelos,  Ramadas,  Santo  Domingo,  Uquillayoc  and 
Vizcachayoc (Blasco, 2011).
Golden  Arrow’s  exploration  camp  is  located  in  the  village  of  Santo  Domingo,  at  an  elevation  of  4,000 
masl. Santo Domingo is a  small community  with a school, church, bus transportation, electricity, natural 
gas and water services. Most people in the village are ranchers (sheep and llamas) while others work in 
larger towns like Abra Pampa or Rinconada.  During exploration work periods supplies are obtained from 
Abra Pampa and San Salvador de Jujuy.
Golden Arrow has invested in building enhancements, and has installed two gas tanks to supply natural 
gas  in  the  village.  Health  care  services  are  available  in  Orosmayo  or  Rinconada,  both  30  kilometers 
away. The nearest hospital is located in Abra Pampa, 66 kilometres away.
Field  infrastructure  at  the  Project  includes  two  office  containers,  a  core  logging  facility,  a  core  cutting 
machine, three storage tents, two cisterns for diesel fuel (7,000 and 10,000 litres) and four warehouses of 
144  square  metres  each,  for  the  storage  of  the  core  boxes,  including  a  bathroom  for  personnel.  
Electricity  is  provided  by  a  46kva  diesel  generator.  Water  supply  for  domestic  and  human  consumption 
comes from public service and mineral water purchases.

6  History
Chinchillas  was  first  prospected  and  mined  in  small  scale  in  the  eighteenth  century  by  Jesuit 
missionaries.    Relicts  of  ancient  furnaces  used  to  melt  lead  and  silver  can  still  be  found  at  the  Project 
area (Kulemeyer, 2011). In 1956 Mr. Antonio Mercado requested a concession based on the discovery of 
galena  veins  in  the  basement  rock.  In  1968,  the  mine  was  sold  to  Ing.  Pichetti  who  later  formed  the 
Sociedad Pirquihuasi  Company  together  with the  Pirquitas  Company,  and  some adits  and  tunnels  were 
opened for small scale production. In 1982 the mine license expired and the mine was acquired by Shell 
CAPSA S.A. From December 1982 to 1989 consulting geologist for Shell, Jorge Daroca, carried out some 
exploration work and after Shell dropped the property, Mr. Daroca requested it for himself, convinced of 
the  good  potential  of  the  area  (Daroca,  undated).  Roads,  remnants  of  infrastructure,  and  minor 
underground workings remain from this activity but no records of this work are available.
In 1994, Aranlee Resources conducted surface sampling and drilled seven reverse circulation drill holes 
for  a  total  of  780  metres.  Assay  results  from  this  work  are  available,  but  there  are  no  samples  for  re-
analysis  or  quality  control  information,  therefore  the  data  have  not  been  incorporated  into  the  resource 
estimate. Locations of drill holes are shown in Figure 10-1.
In  2004  Silex  Argentina,  a  subsidiary  of  Apex  Silver,  conducted  preliminary  reconnaissance  work 
including  trenching,  pitting  and  surface  sampling,  with  a  total  of  165  samples  taken.    Between  October 
2007  and  July  2008,  40  manual  pits  and  nine  trenches  were  sampled.  Surface mapping was also 
completed  at  different  scales  across  the  Chinchillas  property.  A  total  of  1,036  surface  samples  were 
collected  by  Silex  before  drilling  2,220  metres  in  seven  diamond  drill  holes  (Figure  10-1).  Drill  hole 
samples  were  taken  at  one  or  two  metre  intervals.  Drill  hole  locations  and  a  summary  of  intercepts  are 
available in Appendix I. Silex had planned to drill 22 holes but cut the program short during the 2008-2009 
financial crisis. In early 2009 Apex entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and with a payment due on 
the property, opted to drop Chinchillas in favor of its more advanced El Quevar project. The core from the 
Silex drill program remains at Chinchillas (Silex, 2008 and Caranza and Carlson, 2012).
At  the beginning  of  2008,  Quantec  Geoscience  Argentina S.A.  (“Quantec”)  performed  a 16  kilometre  IP 
resistivity survey, comprising nine sections. The pole-dipole interval was 50 metres with 300 metres depth 
readings (Figure 6-1). The  objective of the  program was to detect  and delineate  sulphides related to an 
intermediate  to  high-sulphidation  epithermal  system.  The  data  were  presented  as  pseudo-sections  and 
2D  inversions  of  apparent  resistivity  and  chargeability,  with 2D  level  plan maps  from  3,900m  to 4,250m 
(Quantec, 2008). The mineralized zones at Chinchillas do not appear to be related to chargeability, and to 
date the IP data have been of limited use. However there is a strong resistivity contrast between volcanic 
units  and  basement  schists  and  resistivity  data  have  been  an  effective  tool  for  imaging  the  volcanic 
diatreme shape (Figure 6-2).

In  early  2011  Golden  Arrow  personnel  identified  the  Chinchillas  Project  as  a  potential  advanced-stage 
acquisition  target.  Following  a  property  tour  and  a  review  of  existing  data,  the  Company  completed  an 
option    agreement    with    the    underlying    land    owners    in    August    of    the    same   year.  Golden  Arrow 
subsequently  initiated  community  relations  meetings  with  the  local  communities  at  Santo  Domingo, 
Livaria,  and  Rinconada  as  well  as  with  the  individual  land  owners,  and  submitted  a  new  environmental 
impact  statement  for  exploration  drilling. The  Government  of  Jujuy  convened meetings  of  the  Provincial 
Environmental Management Unit (“La Unidad de Gestión Ambiental Provincial” or “UGAMP”) to approve 
the  environmental  impact  statement  and  work  plans  (see  Chapter  20  for  additional  information).  At  the 
UGAMP  meeting,  all  environmental,  community,  political  and  mining  representatives  agreed  to  Golden 
Arrow’s exploration plan. The plan was approved in March 2012 for a period of two years and exploration 
work  commenced.  Golden  Arrow  has  since  completed  four  phases  of  exploration  and  drilling  (see 
Chapters  9  and  10  for  details)  and  published  four  Technical  Reports  detailing  resource  estimates  and 
preliminary economic assessments, all of which are filed on SEDAR.

7  Geological Setting and Mineralization
7.1  Regional Geology
The Chinchillas silver-lead-zinc deposit is located in the north-northeast to south-southwest trending Puna 
geological belt in the western half of Jujuy province (Figure 7.1).
Figure 7-1: Jujuy Regional Geology Map with Geologic Terranes by Age, and Location of the
Chinchillas Project.
The  elevation  of  the  Puna  ranges  from  3,900  to  6,700  masl.  Basement  rocks  include  Proterozoic 
sediments  exhibiting  medium  to  low  grade  metamorphism.  A  series  of  units  unconformably  overly  the 
basement rocks, including Paleozoic (Acoite Formation) marine sediments deposited in an early to middle 
Ordivician  back  arc  basin  that  are  overlain  by  Silurian  to  Devonian  sediments  (Board  et  al.,  2011).  The 
Puna  was  subjected  to  compressive  events  in  the  Late  Ordovician  to  Early  Devonian  and  Paleogene. 
However, by the late Miocene a basin and range geomorphology had developed and this resulted in the 
development  of  andesitic  to  dacitic  stratovolcanoes  and  large  caldera  structures  with  associated 
extensive  ignimbrites.  (Soler  et  al.,  2007;  Board  et  al.,  2011).  This  volcanic  activity,  and  its  associated 
mineral  deposits,  was  concentrated  along  certain  corridors  defined  by  lineaments  such  as  Coranzuli-
Lipez, El Toro-Olacapato and Arizaro (See Figure 7-2) (Ramos, 1999, Coira et al., 2004, Gorustovich et 
al., 2011).
In  recent  times,  geological  activity  in  the  Puna  belt  has  included  basaltic  volcanism,  continental 
sedimentation  and  the  creation  of  salt  flats,  or  salars.  The  Puna  is  the  most  important  terrane  in  Jujuy

Province for mineral deposits, including: lithium and borate salar deposits; mesothermal quartz veins with 
native gold and base metals; polymetallic quartz-sulphide veins with base and precious metals; gold, tin 
and  copper  placer  deposits;  SEDEX  deposits  with  lead-zinc-silver;  and,  Bolivian-type tin-silver-lead-zinc 
sulphide vein deposits related to intrusive stocks. (Board et al., 2011)

(Modified from Gorustovich S., et al., 2011).
7.2  District Geology
The Chinchillas  deposit  is  located in the southern part of the  Rinconada Range (Figure 7-3). The range 
has a regional north-northeast to south-southwest trend and is delimited by thrust faults to the west and 
east. Various Miocene age volcanic dome complexes with associated hydrothermal alteration exist in the 
area, including Cerro Redondo, Pan de Azucar, Rachaite, and the Chinchillas dome complex. High angle

faulting  and  folding  also  characterize  the  area.  Chinchillas  is  located  within  a  structural  window  at  the 
intersection of northwest fracturing associated with the Lipez-Coranzuli regional lineament and east-west 
controlling structure and lesser northeast trending structures.
The Chinchillas deposit is hosted by the Ordovician Acoite Formation, described by Board et.al., (2011), 
as a strongly folded package of low-grade metamorphosed marine sandstone, siltstone and minor shale 
beds. Deformation and folding of these sediments occurred during the Ocloyic Phase (Coira et al., 2004) 
of  late  the  Ordovician  and  they  are  overlain  by  Cretaceous  marine  clastic  sediments  through  a  major 
unconformity.  These  sediments  are  then  overlain  by  Oligocene  to  middle  Miocene  volcanic,  continental 
sedimentary and volcaniclastic lithologies.

Deposit.  (Main structures and trends are also shown.) (Modified from Caffe 2002)

7.3  Property Geology
The Chinchillas deposit is located in a dacitic volcanic centre with an age of 13±1 Ma (Caffe and Coira, 
2008) as product of a phreatomagmatic diatreme. The deposit was controlled by a dilational fault within a 
regional  scale east-west  trending  fault  structure. At  the dilation  zone  an explosive  volcanic  vent  has  cut 
through marine meta-sedimentary Ordovician basement rocks.  The resulting topographic  depression  or 
diatreme volcanic throat is  elliptical in shape, approximately two kilometres long by  1.6  kilometres  wide, 
and  infilled  with  pyroclastic  rocks  (breccias  and  tuffs).  At  the  contact  between  pyroclastic  volcanics  and 
basement  metasediments  a  wide  zone  of  hydraulic  fracturing  and  brecciation  of  the  basement  has 
formed.  Dacite dome lavas and subvolcanics intrude on the southern margin of the basin at the contact 
between metasediments and pyroclastics (Figures 7-4 and 7-5).

basement rocks, the volcaniclastic sequence infilling the depression, and the dacite domes flanking the
southern border of the deposit.)

Projected to Surface.
7.3.1  Marine Sedimentary Basement Sequence
The  Chinchillas  basin  basement  lithology  (Figures  7-6  and  7-7)  is  composed  of  a  succession  of 
interbedded  layers  of  fine-grained  marine  sandstones  and  pelites  with  minor  layers  of  carbonaceous 
shale. The formation has a low grade of metamorphism and is faulted with local folding. This sedimentary 
sequence  corresponds  to  the  Acoite  Formation,  of  Ordovician  age.  The  Miocene  phreatomagmatic 
explosion produced an intense fracturing and brecciation of the basement that now is in contact with the 
tuffs and breccias that filled the caldera. The fractured and brecciated basement has a thickness of up to 
150 metres and is the main host of basement mineralization.
The same basement sequence is found in the Chinchillas  South area, up to 1.5 kilometres  south of the 
Socavon and Silver Mantos areas, and also hosts mineralization (Figure 7-5).

7.3.2  Pyroclastic  Breccias and Tuffs
The pyroclastic breccias and tuffs erupted from the volcanic centre and filled in the resulting depression, 
contouring the vent walls. This most likely occurred via airfall deposition and flows of ignimbrites as there 
is  no  observed  evidence  of  water-lain  deposits  or  sediments.  The  pyroclastic  breccias  and  tuffs  are 
generally similar in composition and vary mainly in clast size and the ratio of matrix of volcanic, basement 
and dacite clasts. Contacts between flows are subtle with often just a change  in clast size as evidence. 
The  pyroclastics  mantle  the  topography,  infilling  the  basin  and  dipping  moderately  towards  the  centre. 
Contacts between the underlying basement sediments and breccias are sharp. The breccias and tuffs are 
mainly matrix-supported but sometimes clast-supported. The clasts are sub-rounded to angular and vary 
from  fine  grained  to  large  metre-scale  blocks.  The  clast  compositions  are  predominantly  re-worked 
pyroclastic  tuffs,  lava  fragments,  and  intrusive  fragments  of  dacitic  composition,  with  lithoclasts  of 
sedimentary basement pelite or sandstone. Most of the volcanic clasts and matrix are altered by intense 
hydrothermal  activity,  whereas  the  sedimentary  basement  clasts  are  generally  better  preserved  (Figure 
7-8).
Figure 7-8: Typical Chinchillas Medium Grained Pyroclastic Breccia with Dacitic Volcanic Clasts
Dominant and Secondary Dark Grey Clasts of Basement Sandstone and Pelite.
In  some  surface  outcrops  and  drill  holes,  particularly  at  Socavon  del  Diablo,  a  characteristic  coarse 
grained clast-supported breccia is observed (Figure 7-9). Clast type and composition is similar to the rest 
of the pyroclastics within the basin, with dacitic volcanic fragments and lesser pelite and sandstone clasts. 
Clasts range from two to 40 centimetres in diameter. Within the matrix and between clasts there are often
Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Page | 25
voids,  large  vugs  and  sulphide  mineralization  cementing  the  breccia.  Previous  companies  focused  on 
these breccias and  they  have often been  interpreted as hydrothermal explosion breccias (i.e.  Caffe and 
Coira, 2008). These coarse clast-supported breccias are volumetrically minor within the project areas. An 
alternative interpretation is that these breccias are not of hydrothermal origin, rather just a coarse-grained 
pyroclastic breccia, possibly originating near vents within the basin.
Some  drill  holes  intercepted  dykes  of  tuff-like  clastic  volcanics  at  depth  intruding  into  the  brecciated 
basement rocks. These feeders conduits range from centimetres to several metres (Figure 7-10).  In other 
cases, blocks of basement rocks of up to 20 metres within the pile of the pyroclastic tuffs and breccias are 
interpreted as collapses of the host rock inside the diatreme during its formation (“roof pendant”).
In the Chinchillas South area (Figure 7-11), recent drilling confirmed the presence of argillic altered tuffs 
and  breccias  sub-outcropping  or  covered  by  recent  sediments.  These  tuffs,  located  outside  the  main 
basin of Chinchillas, may be related to an additional volcanic center or a ring tuff surrounding the volcanic 
center.

7.3.3  Dacite Domes
Three  main  dacite  domes  outcrop  along  the  southeast  edge  of  the  Chinchillas  basin  between  the 
pyroclastic breccias and basement contact. The domes have a medium to fine grained porphyrytic texture 
with  phenocrysts  of  quartz,  (35  to  45  percent)  plagioclase,  biotite  and  minor  sanidine  (Caffe  and  Coira, 
2008).  The  dacite  domes  are  generally  massive  in  texture  with  limited  flow  banding  and  some  flow 
brecciation along the margins. Drilling confirms that the dacite outcrops are part of larger bodies located 
below the Socavon del Diablo area. At surface they lie horizontally above tuff breccias (Figure 7-12).
Figure 7-12: Showing Contact Between Dacite Flow Overlaying the Tuff Breccias.
7.4  Alteration
Typical hydrothermal alteration is described below separately for basement sedimentary sequences and 
pyroclastic volcanics and dacites.
7.4.1  Alteration in the Marine Sedimentary Basement
In  the  basement  sedimentary  sequence,  mineralization  is  restricted  to  breccias,  fracture  filling,  and 
veinlets  with different frequency  or intensity.  Alteration of the  host  pelite or sandstone in general  is very 
weak,  with  carbonate,  clay  and  chlorite  alterations  close  to  sheared  structures,  with  abundant  siderite 
filling fractures and minor oxides of iron and manganese observed on fractures. Disseminated crystalline 
pyrite is abundant and is syngenetic with the sediments. To date there has been no detailed petrographic 
studies  completed  on  the  basement  and  there  may  be  micro-crystalline  pervasive  alteration  that  is  not 
easily visible in hand specimen.

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Page | 28
7.4.2  Alteration in Pyroclastic Tuffs and Breccias
The  pyroclastic  tuffs  and  breccias  have  undergone  several  different  types  of  alteration,  including:    clay 
alteration,  sericitization,  silicification,  and  carbonate  alteration  mainly  as  siderite.  The  most  extensive 
alteration  is  the  clay  alteration  with  feldspars,  silica  and  pumiceous  fragments  altered  to  different 
assemblages including quartz-adularia-sericite, illite-quartz-sulphides or siderite-sphalerite-pyrite. Biotites 
are commonly altered to sericite-kaolonite-quartz assemblages (Caffe, 2013). There is also extensive fine 
grained  silicification  within  the  suite  of  rocks.  The  clay  alteration,  sericitization  and  silicification  are 
somewhat contemporaneous as they are observed to overprint each other, indicating that the alteration of 
these  rocks  was  a  prolonged  and  variable  event,  probably  over  a  range  of  temperatures  and  depths. 
Carbonate  alteration  is  locally  pervasive  and  appears  late  in  most  thin  sections  studied  (Marshall  and 
Mustard, 2012). Plagioclasts are commonly replaced by siderite and illite (Caffe, 2013).
7.4.3  Alteration in the Dacitic Domes
The  porphyritic  dacites  were  hydrothermally  altered  to  sericite  and  siderite  with  minor  silicification. 
Alteration is more developed in the matrix and in the plagioclasts (Caffe, 2013).
7.5  Mineralization
Mineralization  at  Chinchillas  is  dominated  by  silver  with lesser  amounts  of  lead  and  zinc.  Mineralization 
occurs as disseminated sulphides and matrix infilling within the volcanic tuffs and as matrix and fracture 
filling  in  breccias  within  the  basement  meta-sediments.  There  are  rarely  mineralized  shears,  veinlets  or 
vein-like  structures  within  the  dacites  and  volcanics.  Within  the  basement  lithologies  shears  and 
structures  are  more  commonly  mineralized.  Depth  of  oxidation  is  just  a  few  metres  within  the  volcanics 
and  is  insignificant  within  the  basement  rocks.  Silver,  lead  and  zinc  bearing  minerals  include  silver 
sulfosalts,  freibergite,  boulangerite,  tetrahedrite,  schalenblende,  sphalerite  (zinc  and  iron),  and  galena 
(including argentiferous examples). Associated mineral assemblages include chalcopyrite, quartz, pyrite, 
siderite,  limonites,  manganese  oxides,  cerusite,  smithsonite,  anglesite  and  malachite  (Marshall  and 
Mustard, 2012 and Coira et al., 1993).
7.5.1  Main Mineralized Zones
The  resource  model  for  the  Chinchillas  deposit,  as  defined  to  date,  includes  significant  silver-lead-zinc 
mineralization in four main areas: the Silver Mantos and Mantos Basement zones in the west part of the 
project,  and  the  Socavon  del  Diablo  and  Socavon  Basement  zones  in  the  east  part  (Figure  7-13).  The 
main  structural  elements  controlling  the  location  of  mineralization  are:  the  inverted  cone  shape  of  the 
volcanic  diatreme  forming  the  contact  between  basement  sediments  and  overlying  volcanic  rocks;  and 
the  dominant  east-west  and  subordinate  north-west,  north  and  north-northeast  trending  structures  that 
control  formation  of  the  Chinchillas  volcanic  centre  (Figure  7-5).  The  phreatomagmatic  explosion  that 
produced  the  diatreme  generated  a  symmetrical  cylindrical  shaped  caldera,  with  mineralized  brecciated 
basement  rocks  along  the  contacts  and  horizontal  layers  in  the  tuffs  with  disseminated  mineralization 
(Figure 7-13).

7.5.1.1
Silver Mantos
Located in the upper part of the western area of the deposit, the Silver Mantos zone comprises an area of 
approximately 30 hectares (700 metres by 450 metres) and is currently defined by 71 drill holes, with drill 
hole spacing between 30 and 100 metres (Figure 7-14).  Phase IV drilling expanded the resource area to 
the north across the creek and to the south-east defining a new manto body at lower depths.
Mineralization  is  disseminated  in  several  shallow  (±  5⁰)  dipping  layers  hosted  within  clay  altered 
pyroclastic tuffs and breccias (Figure 7-15). The mineralization occurs between surface and 100 metres 
depth  in  mantos  that  range  between  two  and  60  metres  thick,  averaging  greater  than  20  metres  in 
thickness. These layers are open for expansion to the east. Phase IV drilling defined an additional layer at 
170 to 230 metres deep, referred to as “Deep Manto”. The Deep Manto was defined by 12 drill holes in 
the south-east part of the Silver Mantos and remains open for expansion (Figure 7-16).
Good  continuity  of  the  mantos  mineralized  layers  is  noted  from  hole  to  hole.  Petrographic  studies  on 
samples from the Chinchillas Project area indicate that silver occurs mostly in silver sulphosalts, such as 
freibergite,  boulangerite  and  tetrahedrite,  which  occur  as  black  fine-grained  and  disseminated  crystals 
with galena and sphalerite in the volcanic tuffs (Marshall and Mustard, 2012 and Ma and Redfearn, 2014). 
Sulphide mineralization is also occasionally noted as matrix infill of breccia structures and open spaces in 
coarser tuffs.
The  geometry  of  the  Silver  Mantos  (near  surface  and  shallow  dip  towards  the  center  of  the  basin)  is 
thought to be controlled by the paleo-water table, where mineralizing fluids or gases have percolated up 
through the volcanic pile, and/or along the basement contact, and precipitated upon contact with surface 
waters whose geometry would have reflected the basin topography. In the Silver Mantos area it is thought 
that several main structures control the development of the Chinchillas volcanic centre and mineralization. 
The dominant east-west fault and subordinate north and north-northeast faults all intersect at depth and 
may be the conduits or primary feeder system for mineralization at Silver Mantos.

7.5.1.2
Mantos Basement
Located below  the  Silver  Mantos,  the  Mantos  Basement  comprises  an  area 320  metres  wide and up  to 
120  metres  thick,  with  an  average  thickness  of  80  metres,  dipping  from  surface  at  approximately  40 
degrees to the north (Figure 7-14). The  zone has been traced down dip approximately  350 metres. The 
Mantos  Basement  is  hosted  entirely  within  the  basement  pelites  and  sandstones  and  is  comprised 
predominantly  of  breccias,  crackle  breccias  with  minor  small  veinlets,  fracture  filling  and  mineralized 
structures  (Figure  7-17).    The  Mantos  Basement  is  currently  defined  by  35  drill  holes,  with  drill  hole 
spacing ranging from 50 to 70 metres.
The  mineralized  breccias  within  the  Mantos  Basement  are  aligned  along  the  contact  between  the 
basement meta-sediments and the overlying pyroclastic breccias. The control on mineralization is thought 
to be a result of two complementary structural features.
During the violent eruption and development of the volcanic center the basement rocks on the margins of 
the volcanic diatreme underwent a process of intense fracturing and brecciation.  This created space for 
mineralizing  fluids  to  deposit  silver-lead-zinc  sulphides  as  infill  and  breccia  cement  during,  and  post, 
volcanism.
The location of the Chinchillas volcanic center is coincident with major east–west and subordinate north- 
south and north-northeast secondary structures and it is likely that the development of the volcanism and 
emplacement of the dacite intrusion were controlled by these structures. These structures are thought to 
be “feeders” or mineralizing conduits.
Mineralization within the Mantos Basement is open to expansion downdip in some areas to the east and 
to the south.

7.5.1.3
Socavon del Diablo
The  Socavon  del  Diablo  zone  (“Socavon”)  is  located  in  the  eastern  area  of  the  deposit  (Figure  7-18), 
where 21 drill holes have defined a mineralized area of approximately five hectares (300 metres by 180 
metres).  Drill  hole  spacing  ranges  from  30  to  70  metres.  Mineralization  is  dominated  by  manto-style 
disseminated sulphides within favorable shallow dipping volcanic tuff horizons.
Figure 7-18: Socavon del Diablo and Socavon Basement Zones with Drill Hole Locations and
Mineralized Zones Projected to Surface.
Mineral  occurrences,  textures,  alteration  and ore types  within  the  volcaniclastic  lithologies  are  similar  to 
those  described  for  the  Silver  Mantos  target  (Section  7.5.1.1),  but  the  mineralization  is  thought  to  be
Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Page | 34
related to a different fluid event. There may have been a different vent source within the volcanic centre 
as the Socavon del Diablo mineralization is generally lower in silver and higher in zinc content.
The  mineralization  at  Socavon  is  apparently  controlled  by  the  intersection  of  the  major  basin-forming 
east-west  fault  and  cross-cutting  north  trending  subordinate  structure.  At  this  junction  old  workings, 
including a tunnel and surface cut, exposed a small face of coarse, vuggy breccia with clasts up to a half 
metre  in  diameter  cemented  by  silver-lead-zinc  mineralized  sulphides  (Figure  7-9).  This  was  typically 
interpreted  by  previous  explorers  as  a  hydrothermal  breccia.  Drilling  has  confirmed  this  breccia  to  be 
volumetrically small and it  forms only  a minor part of  the  Socavon mineralized area. The majority of the 
mineralization occurs as disseminated sulphides within pyroclastic tuffs similar to the Silver Mantos. The 
shape of the greater mineralization at Socavon is an inverted cone structure which is probably controlled 
by intersecting faults allowing upward percolating fluids to contact the surface water table.
There is limited potential to expand the Socavon zone to the north and east.
7.5.1.4
Socavon Basement
The  Socavon  Basement  zone  is  mainly  hosted  within  the  Ordovician  interbedded  pelite  and  sandstone 
basement. This zone was originally defined by nine drill holes (CGA-28, -29, -71, -85, 98, 13, 75, 107 and 
115) situated northeast of the main Socavon  zone (Figure 7-18). Drilling during Phase IV expanded this 
zone at deeper levels to the south and to the west. The Socavon del Diablo zone is limited to the east by 
a dacitic dome structure that at depth intruded in the tuff units but at surface flowed over the tuffs (Figure 
7-12).  Immediately  to  the  east  of  this  dacite  dome,  biotitic  horizontal  tuffs  of  up  to  80  metres  deep  are 
covering the newly discovered south expansion of the Socavon Basement zone. Here, the mineralization 
is  hosted  in  open  spaces  breccias  filled  with  argentiferous  galena  plus  a  stockworking  of  sphalerite-
siderite-galena  with  a  total  thickness  of  up  to  320  metres.  The  breccias  have  some  high  grade  Ag-Pb 
zones which were intercepted in five holes (CGA160, CGA-166, CGA-170, CGA-179 and CGA-181) with 
widths  between  two  and  six  metres  (Table  7-1).  Additional  drilling  is  necessary  to  define  the  shape  of 
these breccias. The stockworking carries low grade  silver-zinc mineralization  along considerable widths, 
such as 319 metres averaging 21 g/t silver and 0.6 % zinc as intersected in CGA-181.

The  Socavon  Basement  zone  was  also  expanded  to  the  north-west  (Figure  7-18)  where  mineralization 
was encountered at the contact between the basement rocks and upper  volcanic tuffs. Additionally, this 
zone includes limited breccia and veinlet hosted mineralization within dacite sub-volcanics (Figure 7-19).

7.5.2  Chinchillas South Area
The  Chinchillas  South  area  is  located  immediately  south  of  the  outcropping  dacite  domes  in  an  area  of 
1.2  by  1.2  kilometres  (Figure 7-5).  Magnetic,  IP/Resistivity  and CSMAT  geophysical  surveys  carried out 
during 2013, plus detailed geological mapping, defined a series of targets that were tested with nine core 
holes  in  the  Phase  III  drill  program.  This  drilling  encountered  wide  zones  of  low  grade  silver-zinc-lead 
mineralization.  The  current  resource  estimate  does  not  include  any  of  the  drilling  in  Chinchillas  South 
area.  Mineralization  is  open  in  all  directions  and  additional  drilling  is  required.  This  area  represents  an 
important target for future exploration.
7.5.2.1
Mn Breccia Target
Within the Chinchillas South area, the “Mn Breccia” target (Figure 7-20) was tested with three holes. It is a 
breccia  outcropping  over  an  area  600  by  300  metres  with  a  distinct  triangular  shape.  The  clasts  in  the 
breccia  are  fragments  of  pelites  and  sandstones  from  the  basement  with  manganese-iron  oxides  filling 
open  spaces  and  coating  the  clasts.  The  limited  drilling  on  this  target  intersected  mineralization  over  a 
wide  zone, including  84 metres averaging 26 g/t silver and 0.7%  zinc in hole CGA-124,  and  15 metres 
averaging 181 g/t silver and 1.1% lead in hole CGA-113.
7.5.2.2
Pascua Target
The  Pascua  target  (Figure  7-20)  is  located  1.2  kilometres  south  of  Socavon  del  Diablo  and  was 
delineated based on large geophysical anomalies with no detectable surface expression. In each of four 
holes in this area low grade mineralization  was encountered throughout the brecciated basement rocks, 
including prolific microveinlets of sphalerite, galena and siderite in each hole. These basement rocks are 
partially covered by pyroclastic tuff breccias. Outcrops of basement rocks on the south edge of this target 
show  silver-lead-zinc  mineralization  in  the  form  of  sub-parallel  veinlets  in  a  similar  situation  to  the 
outcrops south of the Mantos Basement.

7.5.3  Resource Expansion and Other Target Areas
Mineralization  at  Chinchillas  in  the  Silver  Mantos,  Mantos  Basement,  Socavon  Basement  and  Socavon 
del  Diablo  are  still  open  to  expansion,  particularly  the  deeper  zones  of  Silver  Mantos  and  Socovon 
Basement.  The  Chinchillas  South  area  provides  further  potential  to  add  significant  resources  to  the 
project.  Other  targets  with  only  a  few  drill  holes  provide  significant  scope  for  increasing  the  size  of  the 
resource,  including:  the  northern  slope  of  the  basin;  the  area  between  the  Silver  Mantos  and  Socavon 
zones;  and  the  dacite  domes.  Figure  7-21  below  summarizes  the  main  areas  and  targets  for  future 
drilling.

The  rest  of  the  area  within  the  concessions  remains  untested,  however  it  has  the  potential  of  being 
mineralized and could include additional future targets.

8  Deposit Types
The  Chinchillas  deposit  is  considered  to  be  part  of  the  Bolivian  tin-silver-zinc  belt  which  occupies  the 
back-arc  portion  of  the  central  Andes  and  extends  from  the  San  Rafael  tin-copper  deposit  in  southern 
Peru to northern Argentina (Figure 8-1). The Bolivian tin-silver deposits are associated typically with felsic 
volcanic domes of broadly rhyodacitic composition (Cunningham et al., 1991). The Chinchillas deposit is 
modeled as a Tertiary aged diatreme volcanic center that has intruded the Paleozoic basement low grade 
metamorphic sediments. The resulting depression, filled with volcanic breccias and tuffs is approximately 
1.5 kilometres in diameter. Mineralization occurs within the basin, hosted in favorable volcanic tuff units, 
on the margins of the basin within footwall sediments and across the sediments-volcanic contacts as on 
structural zones. The mineralization occurs mostly as disseminations, veinlets and matrix filling.
Figure 8-1: Bolivian Tin-Silver-Zinc Belt with Major Deposits
The  Chinchillas  Project  geology  has  some  similarities  to  the  San  Cristóbal  Mine  in  Bolivia  where  silver- 
zinc-lead  is  mined  from  an  open  pit  with  a  mineralized  dacite  dome  complex  and  also  mineralization 
disseminated  in  adjacent  basin-filling  sediments.  The  San  Cristóbal  mine  has  estimated  reserves  (June 
30th,  2011)  of  285  million 
lead,  and  53.0  g/t  silver 
(www.minerasancristobal.com, Sept 1st 2015).   Chinchillas has similarities to many other nearby Bolivian-
type  tin-silver-zinc  deposits,  namely:  Potosí  (Local  co-operative  miners  and  UNESCO  mining  world 
heritage site in Bolivia) and Pulacayo (27 million ounces of silver in Probable reserve at March 1st, 2013; 
www.apogeesilver.com, Sept 1st 2015) and Pirquitas (Silver Standard Resources Inc., 38  million ounces 
of Silver in Probable reserves at Dec 31st 2014, www.silverstandard.com, Sept 1st 2015).

Each  of  the  nearby  deposits  has  some  similar  characteristics  to  Chinchillas,  and  several  have  mining 
histories  spanning  hundreds  of  years.    The    study    of    these    nearby    deposits    has    helped    in    the 
understanding of Chinchillas and forms the basis for continuing exploration (Figure 8-2). In particular, all 
the  deposits  are  known  to  have large  vertical  extents,  with both  Potosí  and  Pulacayo mined over  1,000 
metres  of  vertical  extent,  implying  that  there  could  be  potential  for  additional  mineralization  at  depth  at 
Chinchillas.
Figure 8-2: Simplified Model of Important Bolivian-style Sn-Ag-Zn-(Pb) Deposits and the
Chinchillas Deposit.
Most  of  these  deposits  are  characterized  by  the  intrusion  of  dacite dome complexes  with mineralization 
hosted in shears and breccias within the dacite domes and / or within shears and breccias within the host 
rocks.  At  Pulacayo,  Potosí  and  San  Cristóbal,  where  associated  domes  are  present  there  has  been 
significant  mineralization  found  within  the  domes.    More  rarely,  as  in  the  case  of  Chinchillas  and  San 
Cristóbal,  the  deposits  include  disseminated  mineralization  in  flat  lying  manto  bodies  within  sediments 
and pyroclastic rocks. Chinchillas demonstrates phreatomagmatic diatreme morphology associated with a 
dome structure, as shown in Figure 8-3.

9  Exploration
Exploration conducted by Golden Arrow since 2011 includes detailed mapping, sampling and geophysics 
to aid in the targeting of drill holes.  Special  emphasis was placed on mapping lithologies, alteration and 
structures to understand the controls of the mineralization. In the  basement rocks bedding, foliation and 
brecciation were recorded.
A  handheld  X-ray  Fluorescence  (“XRF”)  analyzer  is  used  to  measure  approximate  silver,  lead  and  zinc 
values in all prospective outcrops. A total of 2,609 points were recorded. Additionally 1,491 rock samples 
were  collected  and  assayed  including  chip  and  channel  samples.  At  Chinchillas  South  and  north  of 
Socavon  del  Diablo,  (Figure  9.1)  502  soil  samples  were  collected,  151  of  them  were  assayed  and  the 
remainder were checked with the handheld XRF analyzer.

Five trenches were completed at Chinchillas with an excavator. Two were located at the southern contact 
of  Silver  Mantos  close  to  holes  CGA-81  and  CGA-82  (see  Figure  7.14)  to  sample  the  tuff  unit  and  the 
contact  with  the  basement.  Another  trench  was  dug 120  metres  east  of  hole CGA-31  (see  Figure  7.18) 
and  north  of  the  creek  at  a  small  showing  of  a  breccia  with  iron  oxides.  A  breccia  with  a  N20E  strike 
assayed  178  g/t  silver  over  0.9  metres.  It  was  one  of  the  first  indications  of  mineralization  on  the  north 
side  of  the  creek.    Two  additional  trenches  were  excavated  north  and  east  of  hole  CGA-158  at  the 
northern contact between the tuffs with the basement.
Talus  sampling  was  carried  out  on  the  north  of  the  Socavon  del  Diablo  and  west  of  the  Mantos 
Basement,, and on the south margin of the  dacitic dome. Results on the north  area showed anomalous 
values of silver, lead and zinc, and later drilling successfully intersected mineralization in holes CGA-59, 
CGA-75,  CGA-107  and  CGA-115  (see  Figure  7.18).  A  grid  of  soil  samples  was  also  completed  at 
Chinchillas South.
The  2013  geophysical  surveys  (IP/Resistivity,  CSAMT,  Magnetics)  together  with  the  re-interpretation  of 
the  2008  IP  survey  was  useful  for  targeting  the  Chinchillas  South  area,  detecting  deep  structures  and 
define the contact between the tuff unit and basement rocks.

10  Drilling
10.1  Summary
Six  drill  programs  have  been  completed  on  the  Chinchillas  property  (Table  10-1).    Aranlee  Resources 
completed the first program in 1994, which included seven RC holes (CH1 to CH7). The results from the 
Aranlee holes were not used in any resource modeling as there is no quality control data.

10.2  Silex Argentina S.A. Drilling
The seven core holes drilled by Silex were HQ3 size (6.11cm diameter). Silex conducted a basic QA/QC 
program including blank, duplicate and SRM samples. Golden Arrow re-surveyed all the Silex drill collars 
using a differential GPS (“DGPS”).  The remaining half core was re-logged and quarter core re-sampled 
at intervals for additional quality control checks. The Silex drilling cut two target zones. Holes CHD-10 and 
CHD-12  cut  mineralized  Socavon  del  Diablo  breccias.    Holes  CHD-14,  CHD-15  and  CHD-16  targeted 
deep  mineralization  at  the  centre  of  the  volcanic  throat.  The  holes  averaged  350  metres  in  length  and 
were unsuccessful at locating significant deep mineralization, however holes CHD-15 and CHD-16 did cut 
the Silver Mantos target at shallow depths (between five and 55 metres). These Silver Mantos intercepts 
were  interpreted  as  narrow  vertical  structures.    Subsequent  re-logging  by  Golden  Arrow  re-interpreted 
these intercepts as disseminated flat lying mineralization within pyroclastic tuffs and breccias.

10.3  Golden Arrow Drilling
10.3.1 Methodology
Energold Argentina S.A. (“Energold”) was the contract diamond driller for Golden Arrow throughout Phase 
I and II drilling.   All drill core was HQ diameter (6.35 centimetre) except for 21 holes, (CGA-44, 53, 55,57, 
59, 60, 62, 65, 67, 69, 70, 72, 73, 74, 77, 81, 82, 85, 87, 89 and 91) which were drilled with the S-3 rig 
with HQ diameter up to 150 metres deep and then reduced to NTW diameter (5.71 centimetre) until the

end of the hole.  Phase III and IV drilling were performed by Falcon Drilling Argentina using HQ and HQ3 
(6.35 and 6.11 centimetre) diameter core except for holes CGA-127, CGA-149, CGA-170 and CGA-181, 
which were reduced to NQ (4.76 centimetre) to reach deeper depths.
The  drill  cores  were  extracted  and  placed  in  appropriate  boxes  marked  with  drill  hole  number  and  the 
depth  in  metres.  The  boxes  were  transported  by  trained  personnel  from  Golden  Arrow.  The  contractor 
performed the measurement of the down hole deviation of the hole using single shot reflex instruments at 
50 metre intervals down the hole. Once finished (depth, azimuth, dip), the information was transferred to 
Golden Arrow geologists in digital format. Following completion, the drill pad was cleaned and a PVC tube 
was cemented at the drill collar with hole number, depth and azimuth inscribed on a metal ticket.
The  Golden  Arrow  drilling  team  followed  a  detailed  written  drilling  and  safety  protocol  for  handling  drill 
core (see Chapter 11). Once the core boxes reached the core shed, they were reviewed and organized. 
Measurements  of  recovery  of  every  metre  of  the  core  and  geotechnical  measurements  (fracture 
frequencies and  RQD)  were recorded. The cores in the boxes  were subsequently  photographed. Select 
intervals  were  temporarily  removed  for  measurement  of  specific  gravity.  Golden  Arrow  staff  recorded 
geological  descriptions  and  marked  the  samples  at  one  metre  intervals  in  mineralized  zones  and  two 
metre  intervals  in  areas  with  no  expected  mineralization.  The  core  was  split  using  an  electric  saw  and 
sampled according to marked intervals.
10.3.2 Program Details 
Golden  Arrow’s  first  drilling  program,  conducted  between  May  2nd  and  June  26th  2012,  included  27  drill 
holes for 3,224.5 metres of drilling (CGA-17 to CGA-43). The program included one diamond drill core rig 
with the team working 24 hours in two shifts.
The second drilling program, conducted between November 14th 2012 and February 27th 2013, included 
49 drill holes and 7,277.5 metres of drilling (CGA-44 to CGA-92). Hole CGA-51 had low recoveries within 
mineralized  zones.  Hole  CGA-92  was  re-drilled  in  the  same  location.  The  second  phase  drill  program 
used two diamond drill core rigs with the team working 24 hours in two shifts.
The third drilling program conducted in the first half of 2014 was performed with a track mounted drill rig. 
On hole CGA-96 the rods were trapped at 194.3 metres, ending in mineralization. The hole was re-drilled 
as hole CGA-126. A similar situation occurred at hole CGA-112, which was re-drilled as hole CGA-112B.
The  fourth  drilling  program  was  conducted  from  November  5th  2014  until  April  9th  2015  with  the  same 
track mounted drill rig. Due to issues with drilling, holes CGA-171 and CGA-174 were re-drilled as CGA-
171B and CGA-174B respectively.
The  average  recovery  from  the  30,661.1  metres  drilled  by  Golden  Arrow  was  94  percent,  including  the 
first six metres where recovery was commonly less than 50 percent.
Appendix III includes summary tables of the mineralized intercepts from all drill programs.

11  Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security
The following  details  the  sample preparation,  analysis  and security  details  used  by  Golden  Arrow  in the 
Phase  IV  drill  campaign.    For  details  of  methodologies  used  by  Silex  Argentina  and  Golden  Arrow  in 
earlier drill campaigns, the reader  is referred to Chapter 11  of the previous technical reports (Davis  and 
Howie, 2013; Davis et al., 2014).
11.1  Sampling Method and Approach
For details of Golden Arrow drilling procedures please refer to Section 10.3.1. Subsequent to drilling, the 
core was placed in wooden boxes and Golden Arrow´s technicians measured the recovery  and RQD. A 
handheld  XRF  analyzer  was  used  to  measure  approximate  silver,  lead  and  zinc  values  every  metre. 
These results were useful to identify mineralized intervals and check subsequent assay values.
All  core  in boxes  was  photographed and  the specific  gravity  was  measured every  10  to  20  metres  (see 
Section  11.5).  The  core  was  logged  and  samples  were  marked  with  an  interval  of  one  metre  in 
mineralized  zones  and  two  metres  in  areas  with  no  expected  mineralization.  Intervals  deemed  to  have 
low  or  no  mineralization  had  pulps  composited  by  the  laboratory  prior  to  analysis,  using  equal  masses, 
with the resulting composite samples representing two to six metre intervals.
Except  for  some  intervals  of  holes  CGA-166,  CGA-168,  CGA-169,  CGA-170  and  CGA-171B  where  no 
mineralization was expected, the rest of the holes were sampled and assayed in their entirety. The core 
was  marked  and  cut  in  half  for  sampling  using  a  diamond  saw.  Half  the  core  was  returned  to  the  box 
while the  other  half was  bagged.  Corresponding tags were inserted, one  in the  plastic sample bag and 
the  second  in  the  wooden  box.  Quality  control  samples  were  inserted  in  sample  bags  and  allocated  in 
order for the laboratory to have a control sample in every batch.
11.2  Sample Custody and Security
Samples  bags  were  placed  in  larger  sacks  (between  six  and  ten  samples  per  sack)  and  were  sealed. 
Sealing  numbers  were  recorded  in  the  Chain  of  Custody  database.  The  sacks  were  shipped  by  private 
truck  to  the  Alex  Stewart  (Assayers)  Argentina  S.A.  laboratory  in  Mendoza,  (“Alex  Stewart”)  where  the 
sample preparation and analysis was performed.
Samples were received by the laboratory and the reception was reported to Golden Arrow. No damage or 
missing samples were ever reported during transportation.
11.3  Sample Preparation
Samples  were  prepared  by  method  P-5  which  includes  drying  the  samples  at  90°C,  crushing  the  entire 
sample up to 80 percent passing 10 mesh, splitting 1,000 grams with a Jones riffle splitter and pulverizing 
to  95  percent  passing  140  mesh.  The  pulverized  material  or  pulp  was  then  sampled  and  200  grams  of 
pulp was sent to the laboratory. In the case of the composites, equal masses of correlative sample pulps 
were combined to form the composite.
11.4  Sample Analysis
Alex Stewart was the primary laboratory and ALS in Peru (“ALS”) was used as the secondary laboratory 
(see Section 11.6.5 for details). All samples were tested for a suite of 39 elements including silver, lead 
and  zinc  by  a  four  acid  digestion  method  and  analysis  by  Inductively  Coupled  Plasma  Spectrometry, 
(“ICP”)  method  ICP-MA-39).  Silver  greater  than  200  ppm  was  assayed  by  fire  assay  using  a  50  gram 
sample  with  gravimetric  finish  (method  Ag4A-50).    Lead  and  zinc  greater  than  10,000  ppm  were  re-
assayed by an oxidizing acid digestion for ore grade material and reading by ICP (method ICP-ORE).

Alex  Stewart  is  an  international  laboratory  certified  under  ISO  9001:2008,  ISO  17025:2008  and  ISO 
14001: 2004.
11.5  Specific Gravity
During  the  Phase  IV  drill  program,  Golden  Arrow  collected  692  samples  of  core  approximately  ten 
centimeters long every 15 metres to determine specific gravity (“SG”). Samples were dried for two hours 
at 90°C in an electric oven. After cooling, the samples were sealed with a plastic film to cover the entire 
piece of core. The weight of the plastic was ignored in the calculations since the volume was insignificant 
(less  than  1  gram  of  plastic  film  compared  with  the  900  gram  average  weight  of  each  sample).  The 
samples were weighed in air and then weighed in water while hanging from a frame. The results from 692 
samples produced an average specific gravity  of 2.37, but as expected, the  SG values of the basement 
rocks  and  dacites  (2.59  and  2.40  respectively)  were  greater  than  the  volcanic  tuffs  (2.13).  The  overall 
average SG from samples collected on Phases II, III and IV was 2.59 for the basement rocks, 2.40 for the 
dacites and 2.10 for the tuffs. One outlier SG of 9.6 in a tuff was removed from the calculations due to a 
likely error in the measurements. The formula applied for the calculation was:

11.6  Quality Assurance and Quality Control
The  same Quality  Assurance and Quality  Control  (“QA/QC”)  system  established  for  the  previous  drilling 
phases  was  used  in  this  fourth  drilling  phase.  The  system  specifies  the  procedures  for  handling  and 
sampling  of  the  core,  the  logging,  the  QC  samples  to  include  in  the  batches  and  the  procedure  for  the 
chain of custody.  QC samples, including blanks, duplicates and certified reference materials (“CRM’s”), 
were inserted in the field in each batch of samples, to check the precision and accuracy of the laboratory.
A total of 1431 quality control samples were inserted as shown in Table 11-1.

11.6.1 Blanks
Coarse  and  fine  blanks  were  used  to  detect  contamination  problems  and  cross  labeling  in  the  process. 
The  blank  used  was  not  a  certified  material  from  a  vendor  but  was  made  from  a  tuff  breccia  with 
essentially  no  silver mineralization  and  low  grade base metals  values.  It  was  sampled  by  Golden  Arrow 
personnel and assayed by Alex Stewart Assayers showing the following grades:

An  internal  certificate  was  produced  (BL-CH-1G)  with  these  averages.  The  blank  material  used  for  QC 
purposes  was  not certified  by  a  round robin  process  at several  accredited  laboratories;  however,  assay 
QC results indicate the material appears to be sufficiently homogeneous to detect sample contamination.  
The  acceptance  values  were  three  times  the  reference  value.  In  the  case  of  the  silver  the  acceptance 
value was three times the detection limit (1.5 ppm silver).
Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Page | 50
From the 211 coarse blank samples, there were nine outliers in silver, lead and zinc as shown in Figure 
11-2.  Following  the  internal  protocol,  coarse  rejects  of  these  samples  plus  two  samples  above  and  two 
below  were  re-assayed.  In  all  cases,  values  were  confirmed.  The  original  weight  of  the  samples  was 
coincident with the weight of the blanks. However, the colour of the pulps and rejects of the outlier blanks 
were  not  coincident  with  the  colour  of  the  typical  blanks.  After  investigation,  it  was  concluded  that  the 
outlier “blank” samples were incorrectly obtained from a bag of mineralized hand rock specimens instead 
of the bag with the blank tuff material. Actions were taken to avoid this error in future.

Figure 11-2: Silver Values in Coarse Blanks (BL-CH-1G)
The  fine  blanks  were  made  from  the  fine  rejects  of  coarse  blanks  of  the  previous  drilling  phase.  The 
original  assays  were  averaged  and  an  internal  report  was  produced  (BL-CH-2F).  Average  values  were: 
<0.5 ppm silver, 23 ppm lead and 69 ppm of zinc. The acceptance values were three times the reference 
value.
During the present drilling phase, a total of 214 fine blanks were inserted in the batches as part of the QC 
program.  Silver  values  were  always  below  the  acceptance  limit  of  1.5  g/t  silver.  Lead  and  zinc  values 
were also below the acceptance limit except for five outliers in lead with values between 82 and 201 ppm 
and  two  outliers  in  zinc  with  values  between  261  and  265  ppm.  These  values  might  reflect  some 
contamination  in  the  laboratory  but  the  absolute  values,  even  though  higher  than  the  acceptance  limit, 
were not deemed to be significant.

11.6.2 Field Duplicates
Field  duplicates  were  intended  to  check  the  homogeneity  of  the  mineralization,  sampling  errors  in  the 
splitting and any  cross  labeling  of  samples.  They  were generated by  cutting  the  samples  in  half,  so the 
duplicate  and  its  original  each  represent  one  quarter  of  the  entire  core.  A  total  of  209  pairs  of  field 
duplicates were produced during Phase IV drilling.
The  pairs  with  values  close  to  the  lower  detection  limit  were  removed  due  to  the  poor  repeatability  of 
results. The criterion applied was six times the lower detection limit, which corresponds to 3 ppm of silver, 
12 ppm of lead and 6 ppm of zinc. The same criterion was applied for the coarse and fine duplicates and 
for the comparison between the primary and secondary laboratories.
For  the  evaluation  of  the  data,  three  types  of  graphics  were  produces:  X/Y  with  the  Coefficient  of 
Determination  R2  (Figure  11-3),  the  Mean  Percentage  Difference  (MPD)  versus  average  grade  (Figure 
11-4)  and  the  Accumulated  MPD  (Figure  11-5).  The  MPD  is  calculated  as  the  percentage  of  Ix1-x2I  / 
(x1+x2)/2.
A  pair  of  field  duplicates  of  hole  CGA-135  from  140  to  141  metres  showed  the  greatest  difference  with 
161 g/t silver and 4926 g/t  lead versus the duplicate with 630 g/t silver and 18400 g/t lead. Re-assay of 
these samples confirmed the previous values. The reason of such difference is attributed to the presence 
of a fracture subparallel to the core filled with coarse galena. The two sub-samples probably host different 
amounts of the argentiferous galena. By removing this pair of duplicates the Coefficient of Determination 
R2 increase to 0.924 in silver and 0.77 in lead.

By removing the pair of duplicates mentioned before, the field duplicates from the Phase IV drilling show 
a similar correlation to the previous Phases II and III drill programs (Davis et al, 2014). Table 11-3 shows 
the  different  statistical  values  from  the  three  drilling  phases.  In  the  Phase  IV  drilling  campaign,  the 
percentage  of  pairs  with  less  than  30%  MPD  decreased  to  60  in  silver,  remained  similar  in  lead  and 
increased to 84 in the case of the zinc.

During the previous drilling program, several pairs of field duplicates with a difference of more than thirty 
percent  for  one  metal  were  re-assayed  and  in  all  cases  the  original  values  were  confirmed.  The 
differences are, therefore, attributed to the variability of the mineralization.

11.6.3 Coarse and Fine Duplicates
During  the  Phase  IV  drill  program,  coarse  and  fine  duplicates  were  incorporated  in  the  quality  control 
process. A total of 125 of the coarse rejects (at 10 mesh) were re-labeled with a new number, re-assayed 
at Alex Stewart and considered as coarse duplicates. The same procedure was applied to 277 fine rejects 
(pulps)  and  these  were  considered  as  fine  duplicates.  Assay  of  the  fine  duplicates  is  not  intended  to 
validate the assay process since each part of the duplicate pair was assayed in the same lab.
Figure 11-5 shows a summary of all three types of duplicates for the silver. Curves for lead and zinc show 
similar tendency as for the silver.

11.6.4 Certified Reference Materials
A  set  of  Certified  Reference  Materials  (“CRM”)  was  used  to  check  the  accuracy  and  precision  of  the 
laboratory.  The  same  three  reference  materials  used  during  Phase  III  were  used  during  this  Phase  IV. 
They were: 1-CH, 2-CH and 3-CH. These were originally prepared by ACME-Mendoza at the request of 
Golden  Arrow  from  rejects  of  previous  drill  core  from  the  Chinchillas  Project.  The  1-CH  and  2-CH 
standards  have  low  (41g/t)  and  intermediate  (146g/t)  silver  grades  and  were  packaged  in  30  gm

Page | 54
envelopes because they do not require fire assay. 3-CH with high silver content (862 g/t) was packaged 
in 120 gm envelopes to accommodate the larger sample requirements of the fire assay testing.
A  total  of  78  CRM  of  1-CH,  78  of  2-CH  and  72  of  CH-3  were  inserted  along  the  Phase  IV  drilling.  All 
assay  results  from  the  1-CH  fell  within three  standard  deviations  (Figure  11-6).  In the  case  of  the  2-CH  
there  is  one  value  outside  three  standard  deviations,  (Figure  11-6)  which  is  in  process  of  re-analysis 
along with two samples immediately before and after in the assay stream. The results of the assays of 3-
CH fell within two standard deviations (Figure 11-7).

Figure 11-7: Silver Values from Reference Material 3-CH
Lead  reference materials  1-CH  to  3-CH  show  lower  precision  in  the  last  batch of  holes,  numbers  CGA-
170 to CGA-182 (Figure 11-9). To assess the situation 198 samples are being re-analyzed. Results from 
this remedial program are outstanding at this time. Any changes to the final results for these samples are 
not likely to have any material impact on the resource estimate.

Figure 11-8: Lead Values from Reference Materials 1-CH, 2-CH and 3-CH
In  the  case  of  the  zinc,  reference  materials  2-CH  and  3-CH  were  assayed  by  method  ICP-MA  and  all 
values  are  within  ±  two  standard  deviations,  except  for  one  sample  below  the  three  standard  deviation 
limit  (Figures  11-9  and  11-10).  Reference  material  1-CH  was  assayed  by  method  ICP-ORE.  The  CRM 
shows a possible bias in the values from the last batch of samples. The re-assay program in process for 
the lead samples includes samples >1% zinc.

11.6.5 Secondary Laboratory for Checks
ALS  Peru  was  used  as  secondary  laboratory.  A  total  of  181  pulps  were  sent  to  ALS  to  be  tested  by 
method ME-ICP61 based on a four acid digestion and reading by ICP. Samples greater than one percent 
lead  or  zinc  were  re-tested  using  ore  grade  method  Pb-OG62  and  Zn-OG62.  Samples  in  the  range  of 
100-1,500  ppm  silver  were  re-assayed  by  ore  grade  method  Ag-OG62  which  uses  an  Aqua  Regia 
digestion and ICP or AAS (“Atomic Absorption Spectrometry”) analytical finish. Samples above 1,500 ppm 
silver  were re-assayed by fire assay  with gravimetric finish (method Ag-GRA21).  ALS Peru is part of an 
international laboratory system and has ISO 9001:2008 and 17025:2005 certifications.
As  with  the  field/coarse/fine  duplicates,  the  lab  duplicate  pairs  with  values  close  to  the  lower  limit  of 
detection  were  removed  due  to  the  poor  precision  of  results,  leaving  only  the  greater  than  three  ppm 
silver values.
Figure 11-11 shows the comparison for the silver-lead-zinc values. The curve of lead values reflects the 
same difference as reported for the reference material.

11.7  Conclusions and recommendations
The authors believe the sample preparation, security, and analytical procedures are adequate to support 
resource  estimation.  Remedial  assays  now  in  progress  will  not  materially  impact  overall  resource 
estimates.

12  Data Verification
12.1  Database Validation
12.1.1 Collar Coordinate Validation
Validation of collar elevation data was done by comparing elevations from DGPS field surveys against the 
satellite photo digital elevation model (“DEM”). Precision of the DGPS is between 15 and 70 centimetres. 
The GeoEye high resolution stereo ortho-rectified DEM purchased by GRG provided elevation values for 
comparison.  Most  elevation  differences  in  the  collars  were  less  than  one  metre.  The  largest  difference 
occurred in three aligned holes (CGA-143, CGA-149 and CGA-153)  where differences between  3.6 and 
4.3 metres with the DEM are due to a local depression in the terrain because of a small drainage.
12.1.2 Down-Hole Survey Validation
Before  the  beginning  of  Phase  III  drilling  it  was  noted  that  the  correction  of  the  magnetic  declination 
between  true  north  and  magnetic  north  was  correct  in  angle  but  had  the  opposite  direction.  For  this 
reason, all azimuths of drill holes of Phases I and II were corrected by 13 degrees counterclockwise. No 
other adjustments were necessary for the other drilling phases.
The  down-hole  survey  data  were  validated  by  searching  for  large  discrepancies  between  the  dip  and 
azimuth reading against the previous reading. No significant discrepancies were found.
12.1.3 Assay Verification
All  the  collars,  surveys,  geology  and  assays  were  exported  from  Micromine  Geobank  software  into 
EXCEL® files and then into Minesight® software. The validation process of Geobank confirms that each 
sample ID is associated with a drillhole, there are no identical sample ID’s, all FROM_TO data are zero or 
positive and no interval can exceed the total depth of the hole. To validate the data, the following checks 
were confirmed:
  The maximum depth of samples were checked against hole depth;
  The  values  of  less  than  the  detection  limit  were  converted  into  a  positive  number  one-half  the
detection limit;
  The  highest  silver  values  and  at  least  one  random  value  from  each  drill  hole  were  checked
against the original assay certificate
  The units were converted from parts per million (ppm) into percent (%) for lead and zinc values
Two methods of analysis were used for silver. Initially, samples were analysed using a four acid digestion 
followed by ICP. Samples with silver values greater than 200 ppm were further analyzed by fire assay on 
a 50 gram sample charge with a gravimetric finish.
Core recovery averaged just over 95%. The more friable tuff unit had an average recovery of 93.8%. The 
Dacite average recovery was 97.9% while the basement unit average was 96.6%. There is no indication 
that grade is related to core recovery.
Following the completion of the mineral resource model, the sample data from 8 randomly selected drill 
holes  completed between  2012  and  2015,  representing  approximately  5%  of  the holes  in  the  database, 
was  exported  from  MineSight®  for  validation  purposes.  The  silver,  lead and  zinc  grades  were manually 
compared to the values listed in certified assay certificates provided from the lab. Of the 1,232 samples 
checked, no errors were identified.
Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Page | 61
Silex drillhole assay data were validated as reported in a previous Technical Report (Davis et al, 2013).
12.2  QA/QC protocol
A  review  of  the  QA/QC  protocols  was  conducted  prior  to  drilling  and  formalized  in  a  detailed  QA/QC 
manual developed by Golden Arrow. Onsite reviews were conducted during drilling phases (years 2012, 
2013,  2014,)  by  QP  Bruce  Smith.  The  procedures  for  core  processing,  the  insertion  of  blanks  and 
standards,  and  for  the  duplicate  sampling  regime  were  examined.  The  QA/QC  program  has  been 
conducted in accordance with industry best practice as described in Section 11 of this report.
12.3  Geological Data Verification and Interpretation
While  several  geology  variables  were  captured  during  core  logging,  only  lithology  was  built  into  the 
geological  model.  Therefore,  geology  data  verification  was  limited  to  determining  that  the  lithology 
designation was correct in each sample interval.  This included the following:

From – to intervals for gaps, overlaps and duplicated intervals;
  Collar and sample identification mismatches;
  Correct geology codes.
A geological legend was provided by Golden Arrow and compared to the values logged in the database. 
Data  were  loaded  into  modeling  software  and  examined  for  discrepancies  in  logging.  Errors  were  fixed 
after consultation with field geologists. The geological models were constructed in collaboration between 
Golden  Arrow  field  geologists,  Chief  Geologist  Hugo  Caranza  and  QP  Bruce  Smith.  Initial  geological 
modelling was exported to DXF for inclusion in MineSight.
The geological model is reasonable and adequate for use in the 2015 resource estimate.
12.4  Conclusion
No  material  sample  bias  was  identified  by  the  QP’s  during  the  review  of  the  drill  data  and  assays. 
Observation  of  the  drill  core  during  the  site  visits  and  inspection  and  validation  of  the  data  collected 
convinced the QP’s that the drill data is adequate for the estimation of Inferred and Indicated resources.

13  Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing
A metallurgical test program was initiated in January 2013 and continued in stages, with the most recent 
work completed in July 2014.  The test work is undertaken by  Bureau Veritas Commodities Canada Ltd,                                       
Inspectorate Metallurgical  Division  (“Inspectorate”) of Richmond, B.C Canada, under the direction of Mr. 
John R. W.  Fox,  B.Sc.,  P.Eng.  of  Laurion  Inc.,  independent consultant  to the  Company  and a  Qualified 
Person as defined in National Instrument 43-101.  To date all testing has been bench-scale. Results from 
the early test work stages are summarized in the previous technical report (Kuchling et.al., 2014).
The  following  is  a  summary  of  the  most  recent  testing  program,  on  composite  samples  from  the  Silver 
Mantos zone, (“MAN-2”) the Socavon del Diablo Zone (“SOC-2”) and the Mantos Basement zone (“BAS-
1”).  This  program  included  locked  cycle  testing,  providing  the  most  representative  view  of  the  overall 
metallurgical  performance  of  the  samples  to  date.    The  following  summary  is  excerpted  from  the  final 
report titled “2014 Project Report on Metallurgical Testing on the Chinchillas Project” prepared by Bureau 
Veritas Commodities Canada Ltd,   Inspectorate Metallurgical Division (Chen and Redfearn, 2014):
[Seven  core]  samples  [received  on  October  15,  2013  weighing  102  kg]  were  air  dried  and 
separated into three composites.  Each composite was individually crushed to 6 mesh, mixed and 
split  into  the  required samples  for  testing.  Silver  contents  range  from  94.2 to 150.6  g/tonne and 
base metals include lead and zinc.
In  this  testing  program,  it  was  confirmed  that  Chinchillas  samples  are  usually  amenable  to 
conventional  lead  and  zinc  flotation  process.  For  most  of  the  samples,  the  majority  of  Ag  was 
recovered in Pb circuit. Overall Ag, Pb, and Zn recoveries are above 95%. Most products cleaned 
well.  Upgrading  of  composites  BAS-1,  MAN-2,  and  SOC-2  generated  Pb  products  with  grades 
ranging from 65% to 79% Pb while Zn products graded 52 to 62%.
Locked cycle tests on three samples (BAS-1, MAN-2, and SOC-2) proved that very high Ag and 
Pb  recoveries  in  Pb circuit  can  be  achieved  along  with good  Pb grades.  For  composites  BAS-1 
and  SOC-2,  good  Zn  concentrates  grading  51.8%  and  60.1%  respectively  were  obtained.  The 
overall metallurgical performance is summarized in the following table:

The metallurgical test work program will continue as the project progresses, and in the future will include 
samples from the Socavon Basement, which is a newly defined zone. For the purposes of this resource 
estimate the metallurgical parameters and recoveries for the Socavon Basement are assumed to be the 
same as the Mantos Basement, based on similarities in geology and mineralization.

14  Mineral Resource Estimates
14.1
Introduction
This  chapter  describes  an  update  to  the  mineral  resource  model  for  the  Chinchillas  deposit  located  in 
Jujuy  Province,  Argentina.  The  resource  estimate  is  based  on  a  database  provided  by  Golden  Arrow 
Resources  Corporation  on  July  8,  2015  which  includes  drill  hole  sample  data  and  a  series  of  3D 
(wireframe) objects representing the distribution of various lithologic units and the surface topography.
This mineral resource estimate was prepared under the direction  of Robert Sim, P.Geo,  SIM Geological 
Inc.  (“SGI”),  with  the  assistance  of  Bruce  Davis,  FAusIMM,  BD  Resource  Consulting,  Inc.  (“BDRC”). 
Based  on  education,  work  experience  relevant  to  this  style  of  mineralization  and  deposit  type,  and 
membership  in  a  recognized  professional  organization,  both  Sim  and  Davis  are  independent  Qualified 
Persons within the requirements of National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) for the purpose of the mineral 
resource estimate contained in this report.
The  mineral  resource  has  been  estimated  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  CIM  Estimation  of 
Mineral  Resources  and  Mineral  Reserves  Best  Practices  Guidelines  (CIM,  2003)  and  is  reported  in 
accordance  with  the  Canadian  Securities  Administrators’  (“CSA”)  NI  43-101  (CSA,  2011).  Mineral 
resources  are  not  mineral  reserves  and  they  do  not have demonstrated economic  viability.  Bruce  Davis 
was  involved  in  the  generation  of  two  previous  resource  models  for  the  Chinchillas  project  (Davis  and 
Howie, 2013, Davis et. al, 2014).
Estimations are made from 3D block models based on geostatistical applications using commercial mine 
planning  software  (MineSight®  v10.0-2).    The  project  limits  are  based  on  metric  UTM  coordinates.    The 
nominal block size in the model is 10 x 10 x 5 m (LxWxH). Sample data is derived from diamond drill core 
holes dating back to 2007. The majority of drilling on the property has been conducted by Golden Arrow 
since 2012.
The resource estimate has been generated from drill hole sample assay results and the interpretation of a 
geologic  model  which  relates  to  the  spatial  distribution  of  silver,  lead  and  zinc.  Interpolation 
characteristics  were  defined  based  on  the  geology,  drill  hole  spacing,  and  geostatistical  analysis  of  the 
data.    The  resources  were  classified  according  to  their  proximity  to  sample  data  locations  and  were 
reported, as required by NI 43-101, according to the CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and 
Mineral  Reserves  (CIM  Standing  Committee  on  Reserve  Definitions,  2014).  All  prices  are  listed  in  US 
dollars.
14.2  Available Data
On July 8, 2015, Golden Arrow provided the drill hole database in a series of spreadsheet (Excel™) files 
containing collar and survey  data as  well as assay results and geologic information.  Also provided were 
3D interpretations, in DXF format, representing the various lithologic units in the deposit area. These data 
were formatted and imported into MineSight®. Silver, lead and zinc mineralization occurs in two areas on 
the  property  which,  for  the  purposes  of  grade  estimation,  are  separated  into  a  western  area  termed 
“Mantos” and eastern termed “Socavon” (see 14.5.4).  The Mantos area includes the Silver Mantos and 
Mantos Basement mineralized  zones,  while the Socavon includes the Socavon  del  Diablo and  Socavon 
Basement  zones,  as  described  in  section  7.5.1.    Elevated  silver,  lead  and  zinc  grades  tend  to  occur 
together  throughout  the  deposit  area  and,  as  a  result,  equivalent  silver  grades  are  utilized  in  the 
generation and reporting of mineral resources at Chinchillas.
The database contains a total of 176 diamond drill (core) holes with a cumulative length of 32,881 m.  The 
distribution  of  drilling  relative  to  the  surface  topography  is  shown  in  Figure  14-1.  A  total  of  55  new  drill

holes  have  been  completed  since  the  previous  resource  estimate  was  generated  in  August  2014.  The 
distribution  of  these  new  drill  holes  is  shown  in  Figure  14-2.  The  most  recent  drilling  program  has 
expanded the mineralization laterally and at depth in both the Mantos and Socavon areas.

Figure 14-2: Isometric View Showing the Distribution of New Drilling Completed Since the
Previous Resource Estimate Completed in October 2014
There are a total of 24,033 individual samples in the assay database. The majority of these samples have 
been analyzed by ICP for a suite of 39 elements. The silver, lead and zinc data has been extracted from 
the  main  database  and  imported  into  MineSight  in  the  development  of  the  resource  model.  A  total  of
Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Page | 66
1,109  metres  of  drilling  (3.4%)  has  not  been  sampled  and  analyzed.  The  majority  of  these  unsampled 
intervals occur in overburden and the others represent intervals with no core recovery. There have been 
no  adjustments  to  the  database  to  account  for  these  missing  samples  –  they  are  ignored  during  the 
development of the resource model.
The  database  also  contains  a  total  of  1,673  samples  that  have  been  tested  for  bulk  density.  These 
samples  were  obtained  from  core  selected  at  approximately  15  metre  intervals  down  most  drill  holes 
giving a relatively consistent distribution of density data throughout the deposit areas.
Individual assay sample intervals range from 0.1 metres to 10 metres, and average 1.32 m in length. 77% 
of  the  samples  are  exactly  one  metre  in  length  and  19%  of  the  samples  are  two  metres  long.  Values 
analyzed  below  the  detection  limit  (<DL)  were  assigned  values  equal  to  one  half  of  the  detection  limit 
(½DL). The basic statistical summary of the assay sample data is shown in Table 14-1

1 A few sample intervals were split at geology contacts when the data is loaded into MineSight®. Therefore, the total 
number of samples listed may be higher than the original data provided by Golden Arrow. 
2 Statistics for silver, lead and zinc are weighted by sample length.
Core recovery averaged just over 95%. The more friable tuff unit had an average recovery of 93.8%. The 
dacite  average  recovery  was  97.9%  while  the  basement  unit  average  was  96.6%.  There  was  no 
indication of a relationship between core recovery and grade.
14.3  Geologic Model, Domains and Coding
The Chinchillas deposit is interpreted to be formed as a result of a Tertiary aged diatreme intrusion into a 
host  of  Paleozoic  basement  schists.  Heat  from  the  intrusion  resulted  in  mineralization  in  the  form  of 
disseminations,  veinlets  and  matrix  filling  within  the  volcanic  breccias  and  tuffs  as  well  as  within  the 
originals schists.
Geologists  from  Golden  Arrow  provided  a  series  of  3D  wireframe  domains  representing  the  various 
lithologic units present on the property. The general distribution of these units is shown in cross section in 
Figure 14-3. Note that higher-grade silver (and lead and zinc) mineralization occurs predominantly in the 
tuffaceous  phase  of  the  intrusive  rocks  and  also  within  the  brecciated  zone  in  the  underlying  basement 
schists. However, relatively high grade mineralization can be found in all rock types.
There  are  no  significant  zones  of  oxidation  or  supergene  enrichment  and  overburden  tends  to  be  non-
existent or, when present, less than five metres in thickness.

14.4  Compositing
Compositing of drill hole samples is carried out in order to standardize the database for further statistical 
evaluation.  This step eliminates any effect related to the sample length that may exist in the data.
To  retain  the  original  characteristics  of  the  underlying  data,  a  composite  length  is  selected  which 
reasonably  reflects  the  average  original  sample  length.    The  generation  of  longer  composites  results  in 
some degree of smoothing which could mask certain features of the data.  Sample intervals are relatively 
consistent in the database: 77% of the samples are exactly one metre in length and 19% of the samples 
are  two  metres  long.  As  a  result,  a  standard  composite  length  of  one  metre  has  been  applied  to  the 
sample data.
Drill  hole  composites  are  length-weighted  and  have  been  generated  down-the-hole;  this  means  that 
composites begin at the top of each hole and are generated at 1-m intervals down the length of the hole. 
Several holes were randomly selected and the composited values were checked for accuracy. No errors 
were found.
14.5  Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory  data analysis (EDA) involves the statistical summarization of the database in order to better 
understand  the  characteristics  of  the  data  that  may  control  grade.    One  of  the  main  purposes  of  this 
exercise  is  to  determine  if  there  is  evidence  of  spatial  distinctions  in  grade  which  may  require  the 
separation  and  isolation  of  domains  during interpolation.    The  application of  separate domains  prevents 
unwanted mixing of data during grade interpolation so that the resulting grade model will better reflect the 
unique properties of the deposit. However, applying domain boundaries in areas where the data are not 
statistically unique may impose a bias in the distribution of grades in the model.
A  domain  boundary,  which  segregates  the  data  during  interpolation,  is  typically  applied  if  the  average 
grade  in  one  domain  is  significantly  different  from  that  of  another  domain.    A  boundary  may  also  be

applied where there is evidence that a significant change in the grade distribution exists across a geologic 
contact.
14.5.1 Basic Statistics by Lithology Domain
Basic  statistics  for  the  distributions  of  silver,  lead  and  zinc  were  generated  by  lithology  type  and  are 
presented in the boxplots below (Figures 14-4 to 14-6).
The  distributions  are  similar  for  all  three  metals;  higher  grades  in  the  Tuff  and  Basement  Breccia  but 
relatively  high  grades  can  also  be  found  in  the  Dacite  and  Basement  rocks.  Higher  zinc  grades  are 
present in the Socavon area.

Figure 14-6: Boxplots Showing Zinc by Lithology Type
14.5.2 Contact Profiles
Contact  profiles  evaluate  the  nature  of  grade  trends  between  two  domains:  they  graphically  display  the 
average  grades  at  increasing  distances  from  the  contact  boundary.  Those  contact  profiles  that  show  a 
marked difference in grade across a domain boundary  indicate  that the two datasets should be  isolated 
during  interpolation.  Conversely,  if  a  more  gradual  change  in  grade  occurs  across  a  contact,  the 
introduction  of  a  hard  boundary  (e.g.,  segregation  during  interpolation)  may  result  in  a  much  different 
trend in the grade model; in this case, the change in grade between domains in the model is often more 
abrupt  than  the  trends  seen  in  the  raw  data.  Finally,  a  flat  contact  profile  indicates  no  grade  changes 
across  the  boundary;  in  this  case,  hard  or  soft  domain  boundaries  will  produce  similar  results  in  the 
model.
Contact profiles were generated to evaluate the change in grades across prominent lithologic types. The 
results for silver, lead and zinc are quite similar. Examples of the results for silver are shown in the figures 
below.
Figure  14-7  shows  similar  or  transitional  changes  in  grade  between  the  Basement  Breccia  verses  the 
Basement rocks and the Tuff verses the Dacite.

Figure 14-7: Contact Profiles of Silver by Lithology Type
The distributions shown in Figure 14-8 show an abrupt change in grade between the Tuff and Basement 
Breccia but essentially no difference between the Tuff and Basement rocks.

14.5.3 Modeling Implications
The  results  of  the  EDA  indicate  that  elevated  grades  tend  to  occur  in  the  Tuff  and  Basement  Breccia 
rocks but high grades can also occur in the other lithologic types. The contact profiles suggest that abrupt 
changes in grade occur between some rock types. However, visual review of the data shows that in some 
areas  there  are  sharp  changes  in  grade  at  lithologic  contacts  but  in  other  areas,  high-grades  persist 
across these boundaries. Overall, the distribution of grades in the deposit tends to occur near the contact 
between the intrusive volcanic phases and the host schist rocks and mineralization can occur in any and 
all  rock  types.  Therefore,  lithologic  type  is  not  a  distinct  control  over  the  distribution  of  mineralization  in 
this deposit.
14.5.4 Generation of Grade Probability Shell
In most parts of the deposit there is a relatively strong correlation between silver, lead and zinc, with silver 
as  the  main  economic  contributor.  Parts  of  Socavon  are  quite  rich  in  zinc  and  relatively  low  in  silver 
content.  All  metals  contribute  to  the  economic  potential  of  the  project  and,  as  a  result,  these  are 
combined, in a general way, for use in the generation of the grade probability shell domain. The combined 
“silver  equivalent”  (AgEq)  grades  are  calculated  for  all  composited  sample  intervals  based  on  the 
following assumptions:
  Silver price: $19/oz Ag
  Lead price: $1/lb Pb
  Zinc price: $1/lb Zn
  AgEq = Au g/t + (Pb% ∗ 36.09) + ( Zn% * 36.09)
Indicator values are assigned to samples using a grade threshold of 20 g/t AgEq. This threshold is below 
the economic cut-off, ensuring that some internal dilution is appropriately retained in the model,  but this 
provides  a  reasonable  segregation  of  mineralized  and  unmineralized  rocks.  Probability  estimates  were 
made  in  model  blocks  using  ordinary  kriging,  and  a  shell  was  created  that  enveloped  areas,  within  a 
maximum  distance  of  100  metres  from  drilling,  where  there  is  a  >50%  probability  that  the  grade  will 
exceed  20  g/t  AgEq.  Note  that  separate  indicator  variograms  were  generated  for  the  main  Mantos  and 
Socavon  areas  in  order  to  reflect  the  differing  trends  of  the  mineralization  in  these  two  areas.  The 
resulting probability shell is shown in Figure 14-9.

14.5.5 Conclusions
Ultimately,  the distributions  of  silver,  lead and  zinc  in  the  resource model  are  controlled  using the  silver 
equivalent probability  shell  as  a hard boundary  domain, meaning sample data inside  and  outside of  the 
domain is not mixed during block grade interpolation.
14.6  Bulk Density Data
Specific  gravity  (SG)  measurements  were  conducted  on  a  total  of  1,673  drill  core  samples  from  the 
various  drill  programs  using  the  methodology  described  in section 11.5.    These SG measurements  are 
utilized  as  bulk  densities  to  generate  resource  tonnages  from  the  block  block  model.  Individual  density 
(SG) measurements range from 1.5 t/m3 to 2.91 t.m3 and average 2.34t/m3. Note that one anomalous (or 
incorrect) value of 9.50t/m3 was removed from the database.
The available density data was loaded into MineSight® and reviewed. It is quite evident that variations in 
rock density occur in the various lithologic units. The density of the Tuff averages 2.09 t/m3 and the Dacite 
is 2.38 t/m3. The underlying Basement Breccia and Basement rocks are similar with averages of 2.58 t/m3 
and  2.61t/m3  respectively.  Density  measurements  have  been  taken  at  approximately  15  metre  intervals 
down  the  majority  of  the  drill  holes.  The  volume  and  distribution  of  density  data  is  considered  to  be 
sufficient  to allow  for  direct  interpolation of  density  values  into  model  blocks. The  lithologic  domains  are 
used to control the distribution of density data during this process.
14.7  Evaluation of Outlier Grades
Histograms and probability plots  of the distribution of all  elements were reviewed in order to identify the 
existence of anomalous outlier grades in the composite database. Potential outlier samples were visually 
reviewed  to  determine  their  location  in  relation  to  the  surrounding  data.  It  was  decided  that  anomalous 
samples  would  be  controlled,  in  most  cases,  using  a  combination  of  traditional  top-cutting  and  outlier 
limitations.  Samples  above  the  outlier  limit  threshold  grades  are  restricted  to  a  maximum  distance  of 
influence  during  interpolation  of  75  metres  when  interpolating  silver  grades  and  50  metres  for  lead  and
Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Page | 73
zinc. This difference in the range of influence is a reflection of the somewhat lower degree of continuity in 
the distribution of lead and zinc compared to silver in the deposit.
The various controls applied to potentially anomalous sample data are summarized in Table 14-2. In the 
main  Mantos  area,  these  measures  have  resulted  in  a  reduction  in  contained  metal  of  four  percent  for 
silver, two percent for lead and one percent for zinc. In the Socavon area, contained silver is reduced by 
five percent, lead by four percent and zinc by 0.5 percent. The proportion of metal lost in the model due to 
these controls is considered appropriate for all elements.

14.8  Variography
The degree of spatial variability in a mineral deposit depends on both the distance and direction between 
points of comparison. Typically, the variability between samples increases as the distance between those 
samples increases. If the degree of variability is related to the direction of comparison, then the deposit is 
said  to  exhibit  anisotropic  tendencies  which  can  be  summarized  with  the  search  ellipse.  The  semi-
variogram is a common function used to measure the spatial variability within a deposit.
The  components  of  the  variogram  include  the  nugget,  the  sill,  and  the  range.  Often  samples  compared 
over  very  short  distances,  even  samples  compared  from  the  same  location,  show  some  degree  of 
variability.  As  a  result,  the  curve  of  the  variogram  often  begins  at  some  point  on  the  y-axis  above  the 
origin:  this  point  is  called  the  nugget.  The  nugget  is  a  measure  of  not  only  the  natural  variability  of  the 
data over very short distances, but also a measure of the variability which can be introduced due to errors 
during sample collection, preparation, and the assay process.
The  amount  of  variability  between  samples  typically  increases  as  the  distance  between  the  samples 
increases.    Eventually,  the  degree  of  variability  between  samples  reaches  a  constant,  maximum  value; 
this is called the sill, and the distance between samples at which this occurs is called the range.

The  spatial  evaluation  of  the  data  in  this  report  was  conducted  using  a  correlogram  rather  than  the 
traditional  variogram. The  correlogram  is  normalized  to the  variance of  the data  and  is  less  sensitive to 
outlier values, generally giving better results.
Correlograms  were  generated  using  the  commercial  software  package  SAGE  2001©  (Isaaks  &  Co.). 
Multidirectional  correlograms  were  generated  for  the  three  metals  in  each  of  the  Mantos  and  Socavon 
areas.  Correlograms  were  generated  using  data  inside  of  the  probability  shell  domain  and  these  were 
used when interpolating grades both inside and outside of the shell domain. The results are summarized 
in Table 14-3.

Blocks  in  the  model  were  coded  on  a  majority  basis  with  the  various  lithologic  and  probability  shell 
domains. During this stage, blocks along a domain boundary are coded if >50% of the block occurs within 
the boundaries of that domain.
The proportion of blocks which occur below the topographic surfaces are also calculated and stored in the 
model as individual percentage items.  These values are used as weighting factors to determining the in-
situ resources for the deposit.
14.10  Interpolation Parameters
The  block  model  grades  for  all  elements  are  estimated  using  ordinary  kriging  (“OK”).  The  results  of  the 
OK estimation are compared with the Hermitian Polynomial Change of Support method, also referred to 
as the Discrete Gaussian Correction. This method is described in greater detail in Section 14-11.
The Chinchillas OK models were generated with a relatively limited number of samples in order to match 
the  change  of  support  or  Herco  (HERmitian  COrrection)  grade  distribution.    This  approach  reduces  the 
amount of smoothing or averaging in the model and, while there may be some uncertainty on a localized 
scale, this  approach produces  reliable  estimations  of  the  recoverable grade  and  tonnage for  the overall 
deposit.
All grade estimations use length-weighted composite drill hole sample data.  The interpolation parameters 
are summarized in Tables 14-5, 14-6 and 14-7.

Specific gravity estimates were made in model blocks using the inverse distance weighting to the power 
of two (“ID2”) interpolation method. Densities  are  estimated with a maximum of two composites per  drill 
hole and a maximum of six composites in total. The lithology domains provide hard boundary conditions 
during estimation and samples below 1.75t/m3 excluded as these are considered to be anomalous.
14.11  Validation
The  results  of  the  modeling  process  were  validated  using  several  methods.    These  include  a  thorough 
visual review of the model grades in relation to the underlying drill hole sample grades, comparisons with 
the  change  of  support  model,  comparisons  with  other  estimation  methods,  and  grade  distribution 
comparisons using swath plots.
14.11.1
Visual Inspection
A  detailed  visual  inspection  of  the  block  model  was  conducted  in  both  section  and  plan  to  ensure  the 
desired results following interpolation.  This included confirmation of the proper coding of blocks within the 
various  domains.    The  distribution  of  block  grades  were  compared  relative  to  the  drill  hole  samples  in 
order to ensure the proper representation in the model.
14.11.2
Model Checks for Change of Support
The relative degree of smoothing in the block model estimates is evaluated using the  Discrete Gaussian 
Correction;  it  is  also  referred  to  as  the  Hermitian  Polynomial  Change  of  Support  method  (Journel  and 
Huijbregts,  1978).  With  this  method,  the  distribution  of  the  hypothetical  block  grades  can  be  directly

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Page | 77
compared to the estimated OK model through the use of pseudo-grade/tonnage curves. Adjustments are 
made  to  the  block  model  interpolation  parameters  until  an  acceptable  match  is  made  with  the  Herco 
(HERmitian COrrection) distribution. In general, the estimated model should be slightly higher in tonnage 
and slightly lower in grade when compared to the Herco distribution at the projected cut-off grade. These 
differences  account for  selectivity  and other  potential  ore-handling  issues  which  commonly  occur  during 
mining.
The  Herco distribution  is  derived  from  the  declustered composite grades  which  are  adjusted  to  account 
for  the  change  in  support,  moving  from  smaller  drill  hole  composite  samples  to  the  larger  blocks  in  the 
model. The transformation results in a less-skewed distribution, but it has the same mean as the original 
declustered samples.
All  modeled  elements  were  validated  using  the  Herco  approach,  even  though  selectivity  (and  the 
economic  contribution)  is  primarily  dependent  on  the  silver  content.  All  models  show  an  appropriate 
degree of correlation with the Herco distributions. Examples from the  silver, lead and zinc models inside 
the probability shell domain are shown in Figures 14-10, 14-11 and 14-12, respectively.

Comparison of Interpolation Methods
For  comparison  purposes,  additional  grade  models  were  generated  using  both  the  inverse  distance 
weighted  (“ID”)  and  nearest  neighbour  (“NN”)  interpolation  methods  (Note:  The  NN  model  was  created 
using  data  composited  to  five  metre  intervals).    The  results  of  these  models  are  compared  to  the  OK 
models at a series of cut-off grades in a series of grade/tonnage graphs.  Examples of blocks inside the 
probability  shell  are  shown  in  Figures  14-13,  14-14  and  14-15.  Overall,  there  is  very  good  correlation 
between  the  models.    Reproduction  of  the  model  using  different  methods  tends  to  increase  the 
confidence in the overall resource.

Swath Plots (Drift Analysis)
A  swath  plot  is  a  graphical  display  of  the  grade  distribution  derived  from  a  series  of  bands,  or  swaths, 
generated in several directions throughout the deposit. Using the swath plot, grade variations from the OK 
model are compared to the distribution derived from the declustered NN grade model.
On  a  local  scale,  the  NN  model  does  not  provide  reliable  estimations  of  grade,  but,  on  a  much  larger 
scale,  it  represents  an  unbiased  estimate  of  the  grade  distribution  based  on  the  underlying  data. 
Therefore, if the OK model is unbiased, the grade trends may show local fluctuations on a swath plot, but 
the overall trend should be similar to the NN distribution of grade.
Swath plots  were  generated in three  orthogonal  directions  for  the  distributions  of  all  modeled  elements. 
There is  very  good  agreement between  all  of  the  models.  Examples  of  the  silver,  lead and  zinc  models 
inside the probability shell are shown in Figures 14-16, 14-17 and 14-18. The degree of smoothing in the 
OK model is evident in the peaks and valleys.

14.12  Resource Classification
The  mineral  resources  for  the  Chinchillas  deposit  were  classified  in  accordance  with  the  CIM  Definition 
Standards  for  Mineral  Resources  and  Mineral  Reserves  (CIM  Standing  Committee  on  Reserve 
Definitions,  2014).  The  classification  parameters  are  defined  in  relation  to  the  distance  to  sample  data 
and are intended to encompass zones of reasonably continuous mineralization.
Measured resources are defined as material in which the continuity of mineralization is  demonstrated by 
the drilling.  Similarly, Indicated resources are defined as material in which the continuity of mineralization 
can be reasonably assumed by the drilling. At this stage of project evaluation, the current distribution of 
drilling  information  is  insufficient  to  define  resources  in  the  Measured  category.  Based  on  statistical 
analysis  of  drilling  information  and  the  level  of  understanding  of  the  geologic  environment,  continuity  of 
mineralization can be reasonably assumed  by drilling spaced at 50 metre intervals. Areas of the deposit 
that  consistently  meet  the  criteria  were  manually  outlined  with  interpreted  wireframe  domains  that  are 
used  to  classify  blocks  in  the  model.  This  approach  ensures  that  the  consistency  and  continuity  is 
retained in the distribution of these higher-level resources. There has been a reduction in the amount of 
Indicated resources in the main Mantos area; the previous approach to classification had several patches 
of  resources  in  the  Indicated  category  that  were  restricted  around  individual  drill  holes.  This  type  of 
distribution  does  not  exhibit  the  desired  level  of  continuity  of  mineralization  required  for  higher-level 
resources.
Indicator  variograms  generated  from  silver  equivalent  sample  data  shows  continuity  of  mineralization  at 
the  projected  base  cut-off  grade  of  40g/t  AgEq  of  over  100  metres  in  some  directions.  Based  on  these 
results,  resources  are  included  in  the  Inferred  category  if  they  are  within  a  maximum  distance  of  75 
metres from a drill hole.

Indicated Resources –  Model blocks that are delineated by drilling with holes  spaced on a nominal 50 
metre grid pattern.
Inferred Resources – Model blocks which do not meet the criteria for Indicated resources but are within 
a maximum distance of 75 metre from a drill hole.
The distribution of resources in the Indicated and Inferred categories is shown in Figure 14-19.

14.13  Mineral Resources
The estimate of mineral resources is restricted within a pit shell that has been generated using technical 
and  economic  factors  that  are  felt  to  be  appropriate  for  an  operation  of  this  type  and  location.  Many  of 
these factors are derived from Silver Standard’s nearby Pirquitas Mine.
Due  to  the  polymetallic  nature  of  the  deposit,  mineral  resources  are  calculated  on  a  silver-equivalent 
basis  using  the  same  parameters  as  described  previously  in  Section  14.5.4  of  this  report.  Silver 
equivalents  (AgEq)  are  calculated  in  model  blocks,  for  use  in  the  floating  cone  algorithm,  using  the 
contributions  of  silver,  lead  and  zinc  and include  adjustments  for metallurgical  recoveries.  There  are  no 
adjustments  for  mining  losses  or  dilution.  Since  this  is  a  resource  limiting  pit  shell,  and  the  fact  that 
mineral resources must show reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction, an elevated silver 
price of $25 per ounce is used to generate the pit shell. This approach, and the prices used, is similar to 
that used by Silver Standard.
The following technical and economic parameters were used:
  Metal prices for Silver Equivalent calculation: silver $19/oz, lead $1/lb, zinc $1/lb
  Metal price used to generate resource limiting pit shell: silver $25/oz
  Recoveries: 90% silver equivalent.
Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Page | 84
  Mining cost: $2.45/t
  Process cost: $16/t
  G&A: $8.30/t
  Pit slope: 45 degrees
Based  on  a  $19/oz  silver  price,  the  base  cut-off  grade  for  the  resource  is  estimated  to  be  45  g/t  silver 
equivalent.  Mineral  resources  are  listed  in Table 14-8. The  distribution of mineral  resources  is shown  in 
Figure 14-20.
There  are  no  known  factors  related  to  environmental,  permitting,  legal,  title,  taxation,  socio-economic, 
marketing, or political issues which could materially affect the mineral resource.

Mineral  Resources  do  not  have  demonstrated  economic  viability.  Mineral  resources  are  contained  within  a  pit 
shell generated using a silver price of $25/oz. Silver equivalent grades, and the base  case cut-off grade of 45g/t 
AgEq, are based on metal prices of $19/oz silver and $1/lb for lead and zinc.

Mineral  Resources  do  not  have  demonstrated  economic  viability.  Mineral  resources  are  contained 
within a pit shell generated using a silver price of $25/oz. Silver equivalent grades, and the base case 
cut-off grade of 45g/t AgEq, are based on metal prices of $19/oz silver and $1/lb for lead and zinc.
In  order  to  be  consistent  with  previous  resource  estimates,  these  are  segregated,  using  the  lithologic 
domains, into various types corresponding to the main mineralized zones described in Chapter 7.5.1, as 
shown in Table 14-10.

Mineral Resources do not have demonstrated economic viability. Mineral resources are contained within a 
pit shell generated using a silver price of $25/oz. Silver equivalent grades, and the base case cut-off grade 
of 45g/t AgEq, are based on metal prices of $19/oz silver and $1/lb for lead and zinc.
14.14  Comparison with previous estimate
The  previous  resource  estimate  was  generated  in  October  2014.  Table  14-11  compares  the  previous 
resource estimate with the current one.

A  reduction  in  the  silver  grade  and  increase  in  zinc  grade  in  the  Indicated  category  is  the  result  of  two 
factors; First, recent drilling has resulted in upgrading  of a portion of Socavon to the  Indicated category.
Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Page | 87
Second, adjustments  in the designation  of  resources  in the  Indicated  category  in the  main Mantos  area 
has downgraded some deeper and peripheral mineralization to the Inferred category.
There has been a significant increase in Inferred resources, primarily the result of additional drilling in the 
Socavon area.
There  are  several  significant  changes  made  in  the  approach  to  resource  classification  and  reporting 
parameters as listed below:
1.  Classification  of  Inferred  resources  has  been increased from  a maximum  distance of  50  metres
from drilling to 75 metres.
2.  The  classification  of  Indicated  resources  has  resulted  in  a  somewhat  more  restricted  volume  in
the Mantos area and an addition of Indicated resources in the Socavon area.
3.  The  old resource limiting  pit  shell  was  based  on NSR  calculations  using  $35/oz  silver  and $2/lb 
lead and zinc prices. The current resource is contained within a pit shell assuming $25/oz silver 
price.
4.  The  old  resource  is  tabulated  based  on  equivalent  silver  grades  calculated  using  $22/oz  silver 
and  $1/lb  lead  and  zinc.  The  new  resource  is  based  on  silver  equivalent  grades  using  $19/oz 
silver and $1/lb for lead and zinc.
5.  The old resource uses a 40g/t AgEq cut-off threshold where the new resource uses a 45g/tAgEq
grade.
6.  While  rock  type  domain  names  are  similar  the  interpretations  have  changed  the  volumes  and
configurations of the different domains making direct comparisons impossible.
In  order  to  show  a  more  direct  comparison  of  resources,  the  new  model  has  been  subjected  to  the  old 
parameters.  The  results  are  presented  in  Table  14-12  and  the  resource  limiting  pit  shells  are  shown  in 
Figure 14-21.

those listed in Table 14-8, also indicating that there has been an increase in resources as a result of the 
recently competed drilling program.

19.1  Commodity Pricing
Resources reported in Chapter 14 are summarized using silver equivalent grades calculated using metal 
prices of $19/oz silver and $1/lb for lead and zinc. These commodity price assumptions were developed 
by  Golden Arrow  using  a review  of  recent  comparable peer  reports  and projected  price  information  and 
were deemed reasonable by the Qualified Person.

20  Environmental Studies, Permitting, and Social or Community Impact
The majority of this chapter was part of the last Technical Report detailing the updated PEA (Kuchling et 
al.,  2015).    Due  to  the  substantial  change  in  resources  detailed  in  this  report,  the  previous  report  is  no 
longer considered current; however most of the information contained in this chapter is still relevant to the 
mineral  resource  estimate  and  on-going  work  at the  Project.   Therefore  the  chapter  has  been  reviewed 
and updated by the Qualified Person to reflect the current status and  information relevant to the current 
mineral resource estimate.
The  Company  has  made  considerable  efforts  in  environmental  programs  and  community  engagement. 
The following presents a brief summary of the environmental aspects, permitting and social or community 
impacts of the work program to date.
20.1  Environmental
20.1.1 Drilling Permit Process
In  Jujuy  province  drill  permits  are  issued  following  the  completion  and  acceptance  of  an  Environmental 
Impact Assessment report. The EIA is submitted for review to the Provincial Environmental Management 
Unit,  or  UGAMP.  The  UGAMP  is  a  multi-stakeholder  group  chaired  by  a  technical  appointee  from  the 
Mining Department who recommends approval or rejection of the EIA and related work application to the 
provincial  mining  authorities.  Meetings  are  held  to  allow  UGAMP  members  to  review  the  proposed 
materials  with  members  of  the  Company.      UGAMP  representatives  reviewing  the  work  applications  for 
the Chinchillas Project have included:
  Local Communities of Santo Domingo, Orosmayo, Liviara
  Municipal Commissioners of Rinconada and Mina Pirquitas
  Mining Workers Unions
  Provincial Department of Water Resources
  Provincial Department of Mines – Mining Police
  Provincial Secretary of Environmental Management Provincial College of Geologists
  Provincial Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Policies
  Provincial Department of Human Rights
  National University of Jujuy
  Chamber Mining Jujuy
  National Parks Administration
  Corporation for the Development of Laguna de Pozuelos
  Provincial Secretary of Public Health
  Provincial Department of Agriculture and Livestock Control
  Provincial Department of Industry and Commerce
  Representatives from Golden Arrow.
Once the  UGAMP  process  is  successfully  completed  the  EIA  is  accepted  and  an  Environmental  Impact 
Declaration (“DIA”  for  Declaración  de  Impacto Ambiental  in  Spanish)  is  awarded.    These are  valid for  a 
two-year period, after which they must be renewed in order for drilling to continue.
Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Page | 95
The Chinchillas Project consists of three contiguous properties (minas) as described in Chapter 4. Golden 
Arrow  completed  the  UGAMP  process  for  the  Chinchilla  mina  and  received  its  first  DIA  in  March  2012. 
Following  a  second  UGAMP,  this  permit  was  renewed  in  March  2014  for  a  further  two  years.  Golden 
Arrow  received  the  first  DIA  for  the  Chinchilla  I  property  in  July  2013  following  a  successful  UGAMP 
process.  Following  a  second  UGAMP,  the  Chinchilla  I  permit  was  renewed  in  June  2015.  Chinchilla  II 
property received its first DIA in December 2014.
20.1.2 Surface Monitoring
In accordance with Argentinean national and provincial legislation, Golden Arrow maintains environmental 
programs  that  include:  Fauna  and  Flora  Monitoring;  Archeological,  Cultural  and  Historical  Patrimony 
Monitoring;  Meteorological  Monitoring,  and;  Surface  Water  Quality  Monitoring  Programs.    Field  surveys 
have been undertaken in  which local residents from Santo Domingo participated and assisted  with data 
collection.
The  goal  of  the  Fauna  and  Flora  Monitoring  Program  is  to  develop  baseline  data  and  to  be  able  to 
evaluate any changes to protected fauna and flora species over time.
The Archeological, Cultural and Historical Patrimony Monitoring Program is undertaken to identify objects 
and/or  areas  that  have  to  be  protected  and  preserved  from  exploration  activities  due  to  cultural  and 
historical value, in coordination with the Secretary of Culture.
Weather  data  are  collected  via  a  meteorological  station  installed  by  Golden  Arrow  at  the  Chinchillas 
Project as part of the Meteorological Monitoring Program.
The goal of the Surface Water Quality Monitoring Program is to develop baseline data and evaluate the 
quality  of  hydrological  resources.  Samples  of  surface  water  are  collected  and  analyzed  for  baseline 
reference.
20.1.3 Laguna de los Pozuelos
Situated approximately 25 kilometres northeast of Chinchillas is the “Laguna de los Pozuelos”, a National 
Natural  Monument  protected  by 
the  “Administracion  de  Parques  Nacionales”  (National  Parks 
Administration)  as  well  as  a  RAMSAR  Wetland  of  International  Importance  and  the  core  zone  of  a 
Biosphere Reserve.  It covers a surface of approximately  16,000 hectares and in this area all economic 
activities, including mining, are prohibited.
Argentina  has  established  13  Biosphere  reserves  recognized  under  UNESCO’s  Man  and  Biosphere 
Programme.    “Biosphere  reserves  are  sites  established  by  countries  and  recognized  under  UNESCO's 
Man  and  the  Biosphere  (“MAB”)  Programme  to  promote  sustainable  development  based  on  local 
community efforts and sound science.” (www.unesco.org)  The Pozuelos Biosphere Reserve core zone is 
surrounded by  a buffer  zone  of  approximately  380,000  hectares  that  is  administered by  the Jujuy  multi-
sector organization Corporation for the Development of the Pozuelos Basin  (CODEPO, for Corporación 
para  el  Desarrollo  de  la  Cuenca  de  Pozuelos  in  Spanish).    As  shown  in  Figure  20.1,  the  Secretaria  de 
Minería  GIS  data  indicate  that  the  Chinchillas  project  is  partially  located  inside  the  buffer  zone,  while 
boundaries provided by the Universidad Nacional de Jujuy (UNJU) follow the UNESCO model and divide 
the buffer zone into an outer transition zone and internal buffer zone, with the Chinchillas property located 
outside of both zones.   Although neither are definitive, the Ministry data of the buffer outline is the most 
recent  and  has  been  adopted  for  this  report.    In  either  case,  economic  activities,  including  mining  and 
exploration,  are  allowed  in  these  areas,  following  the  UGAMP  process  described  above  and  the  mine

permitting  process  described  in  section  20.2.      Furthermore,  consultants  Knight  Piésold  advised  the 
Company  that  in  their  opinion  proper  and  conscientious  development  of  the  Chinchillas  deposit  can  be 
done in accordance with the UNESCO objectives in a manner that will not impact the conservation values 
of  the  Laguna  de  Pozuelos.    Knight  Piésold  does  not  believe  the  Reserve  buffer  zone  designation 
represents an impediment to the continued development of the Chinchillas deposit (Kuchling et. al, 2014).

20.1.4 Historic Liabilities
Some remnants of historic mining activities in the Project area, such as small buildings and historic drilling 
platforms, trenches, tunnels and holes, still exists in the area. All of these liabilities were declared as pre-
existing in the Company’s EIA report for the Project.
20.2  Social & Community Aspects
In  accordance  with  Argentinean  national  and  provincial  legislation,  Golden  Arrow  maintains  Information 
and Consulting Programs, and Social Sustainability Programs.
The aim of the Information and Consulting Program is to establish clear and direct lines of communication 
with  local  inhabitants  and  stakeholders  such  as  Aboriginal  Communities  leaders  and  Municipal 
Commissioners.
The goals of the Social Sustainability Program are to contribute to local development of infrastructure and 
to help local inhabitants to develop new skills and potential commercial activities that can support mining 
activities development in the area.
Golden Arrow  has  been  working  closely  with local  authorities  and communities  since 2011. The  area of 
influence of the Project includes the communities of Santo Domingo, Liviara, and Orosmayo. In general, 
the  communities  are  engaged  in  rural  activities  and  their  settlement  patterns  and  spatial  dispersion  is 
associated  with  pastoral  activity.  Golden  Arrow  has  designed  and  implemented  a  Community  Relations 
Plan for long-term cooperation with the local communities. At this early stage of work the communities of 
Liviara and Orosmayo have been consulted and informed about the Company’s works and plans, but the 
immediate  area  of  the  Chinchillas  Project  is  part  of  the  Santo  Domingo  community  and  this  community 
has participated most actively in the Project plans and works.
Golden  Arrow  regularly  participates  in  community  assemblies  to  discuss  hiring  personnel,  benefits  and 
other improvements to the community.
In  addition,  Golden  Arrow  has  established  access  agreements  with  local  landowners  in  the  Chinchillas 
Project area.
20.3  Mine Permitting
Golden Arrow has reviewed the process for mine permitting in order to facilitate the timely completion of 
the process once a positive feasibility study for the project is completed.
The legal framework for mine permitting is derived mainly from the second section of the Mining Code of 
Argentina  and  its  supporting  National  Law  No.  24.585.  The  institutional  framework  for  the  permitting 
process is driven by stipulations in Law No. 24.585,  with technical Support  of UGAMP and the  National 
Mining Secretariat who is advised in turn by the National Unit of Environmental Management (UGAN for 
La Unidad de Gestión Ambiental Nacional in Spanish).
The  main  focus  of  permitting  is  the  detailed  EIA,  which  must  be  submitted  prior  to  commencement  of 
operations. Upon successful review of the EIA and a UGAMP process similar to that described in section 
20.1,  authorities  issue  the  DIA.    Annex  III  of  Law  24.585  establishes  the  minimum  contents  of  the  EIA, 
which must include:
  Description of the Environment (physical, biological, and socio-economic)
  Project Description
Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Page | 98
  Description of Environmental Impacts
  Environmental Management Plan (which includes measures and actions to prevent and mitigate
environmental impact)
  Plan of Action on Environmental Contingencies, and
  Methodology Used.

23  Adjacent Properties
Silver Standard Resources Inc´s Pirquitas  silver-zinc mine is located  approximately 30 kilometres to the 
southwest  of  the  Chinchillas  Project  in  Jujuy  province.  Pirquitas’  2014  mineral  resources  and  reserves 
summary includes proven and probable reserves of 40.8 million ounces of silver1. As outlined in Section 
8, Pirquitas and Chinchillas share some geologic characteristics. The host rocks and mineralization in the 
Mantos  and  Socovon  Basement  zones  at  Chinchillas  are  similar  in  style  to  the  Pirquitas  deposit 
mineralization.  As such, the Pirquitas deposit provides an important exploration model for the Chinchillas 
Project.
Glencore Xstrata’s Aguilar silver, lead, zinc mine is located 90 kilometres southeast of Chinchillas within 
the  same  province  of  Jujuy.  Glencore  published  2014  proven  and  probable  reserves  of  3.4Mt  at  4.9% 
zinc,  5.6%  lead  and  120  g/t  silver2.  Aguilar  has  been  in  almost  constant  production  for  80  years.  Lead 
concentrates  produced  from  the  mine  are  treated  in  Aguilar’s  smelter  in  Palpala,  Jujuy  and  the  zinc 
concentrate is treated at the AR Zinc smelter, located in Santa Fe province, in central Argentina. Although 
the  Aguilar  deposit  has  different  geology  (mineralization  is  hosted  in  a  skarn  re-mobilized  sedex 
environment) the mine gives important indications of logistics and economic costs of mining in Jujuy and 
Argentina, as well as examples of potential alternative ore processing in Argentina.
Properties directly adjacent to the Chinchillas Project include: mina 543-M-2006 to the south, cateo 855-
S-2007  to  the  west,  mina  1943-V-13  to  the  northwest,  mina  1784-M-2012  to  the  north-northwest,  mina 
1497-M-2010 to the north, mina 1644-R-2011 to the northeast, and cateo 854-S-2007 to the east. Mineral 
deposits of real or potential economic significance are not known to exist on these properties.
Mr.  Bruce  Smith  has  visited  Pirquitas  and  Aguilar  mines  to  compare  the  geology  with  Chinchillas. 
Resource  and  Reserve  information  for  Pirquitas  and  Aguilar  deposits  has  been  obtained  from  Silver 
Standard´s and Glencore’s public data on their respective websites. This information was not considered 
during  the  resource  estimation  and  is  not  necessarily  indicative  of  the  mineralization  at  the  Chinchillas 
Project.

25  Interpretations and Conclusions
All  exploration  data,  methods  and  resource  estimates  detailed  in  this  report  were  completed  to  be 
compliant with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 as set forth in CIM Definition Standards for Mineral 
Resources and Mineral Reserves, (CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions, 2014).
The Phase IV drill program completed by the Company from November 2014 to July 2015 was designed 
to  follow  the  recommendations  from  the  updated  PEA  study  (Kuchling  et  al.,  2015),  which  included 
11,000 metres of drilling to define the limits of the deposit and convert Inferred resources to the Measured 
and  Indicated  classifications,  as  well  as  5,000  metres  of  condemnation,  metallurgical,  geotechnical  and 
hydrogeological  drilling,  in  order  to  prepare  the project  for  a pre-feasibility  or  feasibility  study.    However 
the results obtained as the Phase IV drill program progressed indicated that new mineralization was being 
encountered  around  and  below  the  deposit,  and  the  limits  of  the  deposit  were  not  reached  in  all  areas 
despite the completion of over 11,000 metres of drilling.  It was decided to postpone the remaining 5,000 
metre condemnation metallurgical and geotechnical program until after the completion of a new resource 
estimate and a re-evaluation of program requirements.   Results from the drilling resulted in a substantial 
increase  in  resources  but  not  an  upgrade  of  a  significant  portion  to  higher  categories,  as  was  originally 
planned.
The authors conclude that:
  There is a good understanding of the geology and mineralization of the deposit.
  Exploration  drilling,  sampling,  sample  preparation,  assaying,  specific  gravity  measurements  and 
drill hole surveys have been carried out in accordance with industry standard best practices and 
are  suitable  to  support  resource  estimates.  Sampling  and  assaying  include  appropriate  quality 
assurance and control procedures.
  The  resource  model  developed  for  the  Chinchillas  deposit  uses  accepted  modeling  and  grade
estimation methods. The model is a reasonable reflection of deposit geology.
  The  estimated  Indicated  resource  using  a  cut-off  grade  of  45  g/t  of  equivalent  silver  is  25.9  Mt 
with grades of 77.2 g/t silver, 0.66% lead, and 0.66% zinc. A further Inferred resource of 47.1 Mt 
with  grades  of  50.2  g/t  silver,  0.52%  lead,  and  0.64%  zinc  has  been  estimated  using  the  same 
cut-off grade.
  Metallurgical  studies,  including  locked-cycle  tests,  have  been  completed  on  representative 
samples. The results indicate that the recovery of silver, lead, and zinc is likely to be very good. 
Additional  metallurgical  testing  will  be  required  to  confirm  the  optimum  processing  for  all 
mineralization types.
  Based on conclusions in the previous PEA (Kuchling, 2015), the expanded resource estimate in
this report warrants updating the economic study of the Chinchillas deposit.
  Upgrading of the resource categories will be required to further advance the project to feasibility.
  Potential remains to expand the current resource, and to define new resources on the property.

26  Recommendations
The  Phase  IV  exploration  drill  program  and  re-estimation  of  resources  for  the  deposit  has  added 
significantly  to  the  resource  base.        A  new  economic  study  is  required  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  these 
new  resources  and  the  current  economic  and  market  conditions  on  the  project  design  and  viability.  A 
detailed  evaluation  such  as  Feasibility  Study  (“FS”)  or  Pre-Feasibility  Study  (“PFS”),  will  require 
converting  Inferred  resources  to  the  Measured  and/or  Indicated  classification  through  an  in-fill  drill 
program.
The following activities are recommended to advance the Chinchillas Project:
  Update the existing PEA based on the results of the Phase IV exploration program

Initiate  Feasibility  Study  or  Pre-Feasibility  Study.    In  preparation  for  that  study,  the  following  is 
recommended:
o  A  further  10,000  metres  of  infill  drilling  to  convert  Inferred  resources  to  the  Indicated
classification.   The estimated budget is $3M.
o  5,000  metres  of  condemnation,  metallurgical,  geotechnical  and  hydrogeological  drilling.
The estimated cost is $1.5M
o  Continue with metallurgical testing.  The estimated cost $0.3M.
o  Golden Arrow should continue with its social and environmental programs
o
Initiation of the mine permitting process.
A  detailed  plan  and  budget  for  a  PFS  or  FS  is  recommended  once  the  above  work  programs  are 
complete.
