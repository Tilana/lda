<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The 15th Workshop on Regional Cooperation for the Promotion and Protection of 
Human Rights in the Asia-Pacific Region was held in Bangkok from 21 to 23 April 2010. It 
was attended by 71 participants, including 31 Member States from the region, as well as 
representatives of subregional organizations, national human rights institutions (NHRIs), 
United Nations agencies and programmes, and non-governmental organizations.1 The 
theme proposed by Thailand and accepted by Member States for the Workshop was 
&#8220;Strengthening regional human rights mechanisms by sharing best practices and 
experiences&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>2. In preparation for the Workshop, the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) invited five resource persons with expertise in 
regional human rights systems, namely, Mr. Christof Heyns, Mr. George Wachira, Ms. 
Christina Cerna, Mr. Vitit Muntarbhorn, and Ms. Sriprapha Petcharamesree, to facilitate the 
thematic sessions and make presentations on the topic. Ambassador Sihasak 
Phuangketkeow of Thailand chaired the meeting and also made an expert contribution on 
the newly created Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Intergovernmental 
Commission on Human Rights (AICHR).  
</p>
<p><b> II. Opening of the 15th Workshop 
</b></p>
<p>3. The Workshop was addressed at its opening by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of 
Thailand, Mr. Kasit Piromya, and by Mr. Homayoun Alizadeh, Regional Representative for 
OHCHR in South-East Asia, who delivered a statement on behalf of the United Nations 
Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ms. Kyung-wha Kang. The Minister 
observed that Thailand had hosted the workshop once before in 2001, and that Thailand 
was a candidate for the Human Rights Council in May 2010. He noted that the development 
of AICHR reflected the aspiration of ASEAN to be committed to international human rights 
standards, that regional arrangements had a powerful role to play in reinforcing 
international standards, and lastly, that human rights and democratic practice would be the 
practice of any country that was part of ASEAN. 
</p>
<p>4. The Deputy High Commissioner in her opening statement, delivered by the Regional 
Representative, reviewed some of the achievements of the last 20 years with regard to the 
original objective of the Asia-Pacific Regional Framework, and welcomed especially 
developments such as the creation of the Committee of Experts on Human Rights under the 
Arab Charter on Human Rights, as well as the creation of the AICHR. She also noted the 
consultations on the development of a human rights mechanism begun by the Organization 
of the Islamic Conference (OIC). The Deputy High Commissioner hailed the significant 
developments made in the region with regard to national human rights institutions, noting 
there were currently 13 &#8220;A&#8221; accredited institutions in the Asia-Pacific region, and 
highlighted the two workshops that took place in Manila and Samoa in 2007 and 2009 on 
the creation of NHRIs in accordance with the principles relating to the status of national 
institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (the Paris Principles). With 
regard to the right to development and economic, social and cultural rights, she welcomed 
the adoption by the General Assembly of the Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on 10 December 2008, and noted that, 
</p>
<p>  
 1 Unfortunately the participation of the Deputy High Commissioner and representatives of some 
</p>
<p>Member States was prevented by flight cancellations in the wake of the Icelandic volcanic eruption.  </p>


<p>unfortunately, there had not been any ratifications of that important protocol yet in the 
Asia-Pacific region. The Deputy High Commissioner then outlined some of the 
characteristics of credible and effective regional human rights mechanisms and offered the 
assistance of OHCHR in providing technical expertise in their creation and strengthening, 
including the sharing of information and lessons learned.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Review of the four pillars of the Tehran Framework  
</b></p>
<p>5. The first day&#8217;s discussions consisted of statements by States and national human 
rights institutions, which updated participants on developments at the national level and 
emphasized their commitment to the goals of the workshop and of the Asia-Pacific 
Regional Framework process. Member States and NHRIs used the opportunity to make 
statements on their achievements, experiences and lessons learned under each of the four 
pillars under the Tehran framework; namely, human rights education, economic, social and 
cultural rights and the right to development, national human rights action plans and NHRIs. 
The civil society representative from the Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development 
(Forum-Asia) made a statement on behalf of the organizations, which included 25 civil 
society organizations, 12 NHRIs and the Asia-Pacific Forum of NHRIs, that had 
participated in the civil society consultations the day before the official workshop began. 
</p>
<p>6. Several States highlighted the new opportunities presented by the universal periodic 
review, as well as challenges in implementing the recommendations coming out of that 
mechanism. Regarding the Tehran Framework of Regional Technical Cooperation 
Programme for Asia and the Pacific (Tehran Framework)2, Governments updated one 
another on the ratification of human rights treaties and their optional protocols as well as on 
developments with regard to NHRIs, human rights education and national human rights 
action plans. The challenges faced by Governments in fulfilling their reporting 
requirements of the various treaty bodies was mentioned, as well as the importance of 
capacity-building, and the need to focus more on economic, social and cultural rights in the 
light of the recent global financial crisis. OHCHR field presences were hailed as crucial 
partners to the Member States in the region on human rights. OHCHR was requested to 
continue its assistance to the Pacific region in terms of preparations for the universal 
periodic review process, and the database of universal periodic review recommendations 
from the Regional Office in Bangkok was welcomed. 
</p>
<p>7. The continued relevance of the four pillars of the Tehran Framework in developing 
some of the core national components and capacities needed at the country level was noted, 
as was the emergence of new regional human rights infrastructures, particularly with the 
development of mechanisms in the League of Arab States, OIC and ASEAN. The growing 
importance of new processes at the international level was emphasized, particularly the 
universal periodic review and the recent Human Rights Council mandated seminars which 
brought together the different regional mechanisms at the international level. Several 
participants noted the relationship between the universal periodic review and the four 
pillars, including refocusing attention on economic, social and cultural rights and the 
development of national human rights action plans. Many Member States noted the 
challenges that the global financial crisis posed to economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>8. It was noted that effective and independent national human rights institutions had 
developed strongly under the Tehran Framework. Many Member States reported on their 
NHRIs, and several highlighted that they were exploring, or already had explored, the 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>2010/files/introduction_key_documents_annual_meetings.pdf. </p>


<p>possibility of drafting legislation for their establishment. The NHRIs represented at the 
meeting reported on some of their important activities as well as the regional networking 
which had developed among them, particularly through the Asia Pacific Forum of National 
Human Rights Institutions and the South East Asia National Human Rights Institutions 
Forum. It was noted that a first meeting of NHRIs of the South Asian region had taken 
place last year, and that in April 2010, the national human rights institutions of the Gulf 
Cooperation Council States had held a regional meeting, which was attended by the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights during her official visit to the region. 
</p>
<p>9. Many Member States reported on the value of national human rights action plans in 
giving momentum and coherence to their national efforts. Several Member States are now 
in the process of developing and implementing their second - even third - national human 
rights action plans. Two significant trends were highlighted in that discussion. First, some 
of the more recent plans, such as those in Indonesia and in the Philippines, were being 
increasingly localized, i.e. there was decentralization of implementation from the national 
to the local government level. The recent review of the National Human Rights 
Commission legislation of India was also noted in that respect, as it provided a greater role 
for state-level human rights commissions. 
</p>
<p>10. A second element that emerged was the linkage between the universal periodic 
review process and the development of national human rights action plans. It was noted that 
there was a lot of potential synergy between the preparation and follow-up to the universal 
periodic review, and the development and implementation of a national human rights action 
plan, and there was a lot of interest in the sharing of further experiences and best practices 
in that respect. While most representatives welcomed the universal periodic review 
mechanism, many delegations noted the strain that Governments were under in both 
reporting to that mechanism and following up on the recommendations together with the 
treaty body recommendations. In that context, more assistance and capacity-building from 
OHCHR was needed. Examples were given of OHCHR trainings in New Zealand, 
Viet Nam, Thailand and Malaysia that had served to assist Member States with these 
additional obligations. 
</p>
<p>11. States reported various new initiatives in the field of human rights education and 
economic, social and cultural rights. The current context of the global economic crisis was 
highlighted in that respect. Mr. Muntarbhorn emphasized that those agendas engaged 
different actors, particularly the various line ministries involved in education, social policy 
and protection issues. 
</p>
<p>12. The meeting also heard from civil society representatives their interest in supporting 
those different dimensions of the Asia-Pacific Regional Framework on an ongoing basis. 
The representatives stressed the importance of involving them in intersessional activities 
and on ensuring more comprehensive monitoring and evaluation of the progress made in 
each of those areas.  
</p>
<p>13. In summary, the three main observations that emerged from the first day of 
discussions were that: (a) developments at the international level, such as the universal 
periodic review, had reinvigorated national processes, including those specified under the 
Tehran Framework; (b) involvement of civil society had increased in both international and 
regional intergovernmental processes, while at the same time there was a call for more 
systematic consultation and cooperation between key actors, including national human 
rights institutions; and (c) increased capacity-building was needed to help support Member 
States fulfil their national commitments made through new mechanisms at the international 
and regional level, including the universal periodic review. </p>


<p><b> IV. Thematic discussions  
</b></p>
<p>14. The second day of the programme was devoted to an in-depth and specialized 
discussion on the development of regional human rights mechanisms in Asia and the 
Pacific and in other parts of the world. After an overview by Mr. Vitit Muntarbhorn, there 
were presentations on the development of AICHR by Ambassador Sihasak Phuangketkeow, 
as well as by Ms. Sriprapha Petcharamesree and Mr. Rafendi Djamin, the representatives of 
Thailand and Indonesia to AICHR, respectively. The meeting also received positive inputs 
from representatives of the Pacific Islands Forum and the Secretariat of the Pacific 
Community, as well as insights into South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation 
(SAARC) initiatives on women and children, and the development of an OIC independent 
commission on human rights. That was followed by expert presentations by the resource 
persons on the development of regional human rights systems in Africa, the Americas and 
Europe, and some of the common experiences and elements that could be identified from 
these systems.  
</p>
<p>15. Mr. Muntarbhorn made a presentation entitled &#8220;Promotion and protection of human 
rights in Asia and the Pacific: re-energising the regional panorama&#8221;, outlining the 
background of the Asia-Pacific Regional Framework and the current status of initiatives at 
the subregional level in developing human rights arrangements. In particular, he 
emphasized some of the recent developments, such as the increased ratifications of human 
rights treaties by Asia-Pacific countries; the full participation of Asia-Pacific countries in 
the universal periodic review process; the greater access for United Nations special 
rapporteurs to the region and the expansion of United Nations presences and teamwork on 
human rights in the region. The presenter outlined the current status of the ASEAN human 
rights system, the Pacific Islands initiatives, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and 
SAARC, noting the different forms of regional arrangements that were possible. He 
described how regional arrangements in the Asia-Pacific region tended to concentrate more 
on cooperation and promotion than on the protection of human rights (such as 
investigations, field visits, monitoring and complaints procedures), and that the presence of 
the United Nations in the region was important to ensure that there were no protection gaps 
left. He emphasized that national, regional and international systems were needed for the 
promotion and protection of human rights, and that the different stakeholders involved 
needed to link up. He put forward a new concept entitled &#8220;universality in diversity&#8221; as a 
way to characterize the need to balance the universality of human rights with the need to 
respect and take into account cultural diversity (and sovereignty) in the region. Against that 
backdrop, he asked participants to consider the possibility of adding a review of 
regional/subregional mechanisms as either a fifth pillar of the Tehran Framework, or as a 
permanent agenda item at the workshops. He ended by stating that there was no substitute 
for the effective implementation of human rights at the national level. 
</p>
<p>16. The presentation by Ambassador Sihasak Phuangketkeow revealed the steps towards 
the creation of the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights. He informed 
participants that the possibility of establishing such a mechanism was first discussed by 
ASEAN in 1993, following the conclusion of the 1993 Vienna World Conference on 
Human Rights. In 1995, the idea was taken up and kept alive at the non-government level 
with the establishment of the Working Group for an ASEAN Human Rights Mechanism, 
which was comprised of people with a variety of backgrounds. By 1998, annual meetings 
were being held between the Working Group and senior ASEAN government officials to 
discuss how the idea of establishing an ASEAN human rights mechanism could be moved 
forward. The adoption of the Charter of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in 2007 
marked the beginning of the official intergovernmental process towards the creation of 
AICHR, and in 2008, 16 meetings had been held over a 15-month period to negotiate the 
terms of reference for the body. AICHR had been inaugurated in October 2009, and had so </p>


<p>far met three times (two informal meetings and one formal meeting). Despite the principle 
of non-interference that ASEAN adhered to, the speaker noted that there currently existed 
within ASEAN increasing recognition of the universality of human rights and that human 
rights were not only domestic concerns but transcended national borders. He noted that a 
balance had had to be reached in the establishment of AICHR, recognizing the diversity in 
the region, while seeking to make it a credible mechanism. The speaker acknowledged 
arguments that there were contradictions in the AICHR terms of reference, but stated that 
compromises had to be made and argued that ASEAN was taking an evolutionary approach 
and that was just the beginning. 
</p>
<p>17. Regarding the key elements in the AICHR terms of reference, the speaker specified 
that AICHR was an intergovernmental body, distinguishing it from other regional 
mechanisms that were more independent. It was the overarching human rights body for 
ASEAN, not in the sense that it would subsume other human rights bodies, but that it would 
help to coordinate the human rights work of ASEAN. He observed that AICHR would 
operate according to a consensus that emerged from discussion as opposed to voting, with 
one or two countries not holding back the views of the majority. In terms of promotion and 
protection, he acknowledged the criticism of AICHR for its &#8220;lack of teeth&#8221; in terms of a 
protection mandate, with no explicit mandate given, for instance, to consider individual 
complaints. However, he countered that AICHR still had &#8220;baby teeth&#8221;, and that it did have 
the mandate to obtain information on human rights developments, write reports on human 
rights issues for submission to ASEAN foreign ministers, engage with civil society, and 
meet in different countries of the region. Furthermore, there were elements that could lead 
to a protection role if AICHR members were creative enough. He acknowledged that 
AICHR must have the means to do its work, touching on the importance of funding and 
secretariat support. The speaker said that, following its second formal meeting at the end of 
June and the agreement of its workplan, AICHR would move on to promotion, norm-setting 
and the development of elements of protection. He emphasized that AICHR would have to 
make the process of evolution an inclusive one, and that it would have to act as a catalyst to 
encourage national Governments to strengthen national legislation and institutions. 
</p>
<p>18. Ms. Sriprapha Petcharamesree, the representative of Thailand to AICHR, noted that 
AICHR was the first step towards the development of an Asia-Pacific regional human 
rights system, and also noted that it was an important milestone for the people of ASEAN. 
She emphasized that the terms of reference represented the maximum that was acceptable 
to ASEAN members, and that by raising awareness of the human rights responsibilities of 
Governments AICHR would help to prevent some human rights violations from occurring 
in the region. She expressed her hope that AICHR would eventually become a credible 
human rights institution. She noted the diversity of the AICHR members, with diplomats, 
human rights commissioners, a judge and civil society representatives all sitting together. 
The speaker acknowledged that there would be a wide range of ideas being aired, which 
was good in that many voices would be heard, but that would also make reaching a 
consensus a challenge. Focusing on the value added, she said that regional human rights 
mechanisms did not obviate the need for national mechanisms, and that human rights were 
still best implemented at the national level. Nevertheless, regional mechanisms had an 
important role to play in capacity-building, education, creating regional networks and 
assisting with the creation and development of national human rights mechanisms. The 
speaker said regional mechanisms were also able to bring more focus and regional 
specificity to the work of the international human rights system. In conclusion, she 
reminded participants that AICHR was still only six months old, and had yet to learn how 
to manage or bridge its gaps, but emphasized that dialogue with all stakeholders was vital 
in the process. She noted that the process was very much an evolutionary one and expressed 
her hope that AICHR would not take too long to evolve into an effective mechanism. </p>


<p>19. Ms. Petcharamesree acknowledged that while there had been a lot of criticism 
regarding the independence of AICHR, much came down to how the individual members 
interpreted their role. With respect to the development of an ASEAN Human Rights 
Declaration, she stressed the importance of it not falling below international standards. She 
stated that AICHR did not exist in isolation, but formed part of a wider ASEAN 
architecture of which human rights should also be a part. She also emphasized that in order 
for AICHR to know what needed changing and for it to become a relevant body, it would 
need to get close to those who suffered from human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>20. Mr. Rafendi Djamin noted three points in respect of AICHR. First, regarding the 
fundamental issue of independence, he observed that the AICHR members were 
Government appointees and were accountable to their respective Governments. 
Nevertheless, he stated that the terms of reference provided the opportunity for each 
member State to organize consultations at the national level in selecting their 
representatives to AICHR, and two of the current members had come from an open national 
selection process. Therefore, he saw hope that more countries in the future would follow 
that example. He also explained that AICHR was a principal organ of ASEAN and a 
Charter-based institution which would have a key role to play in integrating the three 
ASEAN pillars (security, socio-cultural and economic) into one ASEAN community. 
Regarding the other human rights mechanisms and instruments being developed by 
ASEAN, the speaker emphasized that AICHR had an overarching role to play in bringing 
those different elements together to strengthen the overall human rights framework. 
Concerning the ability to receive petitions, he observed that civil society was already 
demanding that AICHR take on that role. He saw that as a good sign, as it showed that 
there was a lot of expectation and hope coming from civil society. Lastly, he noted that it 
would be important to reflect on how the Asia-Pacific Regional Framework could support 
the establishment of new regional mechanisms and help link regional processes with the 
international human rights system. 
</p>
<p>21. The Pacific Islands Forum updated participants on developments in its region, 
noting that the Pacific Plan included mention of human rights, and that the Forum hoped to 
start a scoping study for the creation of a regional human rights mechanism for the Pacific. 
It was noted that in the Pacific region, the universal periodic review had inspired dialogue 
about regional human rights mechanisms and national human rights institutions. 
</p>
<p>22. In the discussion, the importance of the regional context was highlighted, in 
particular that regional mechanisms had emerged out of the broader regional dynamics or 
community-building processes in their different regions. That had resulted in a flexible, 
evolutionary process, as mechanisms had grown and developed and found new ways to 
enrich both their regional systems and the international human rights system. As a result, 
there was diversity among regional human rights mechanisms in terms of their form, 
substance, powers, membership and resources. What was common, though, was the way in 
which they had evolved historically and contextually over time to play an ever more 
influential and protective role. For example, the League of Arab States updated the Arab 
Charter on Human Rights, the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights 
strengthened the criteria and independence of its membership, and the Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights developed a method for handling individual complaints and 
experimented with country visits. Mr. Muntarbhorn also reminded participants that the real 
test for all human rights mechanisms, whether national or international, was the 
implementation and enforcement of their various findings and recommendations. 
</p>
<p>23. There was a recognition that regional arrangements played a fundamental role in 
promoting and protecting human rights, and that while those arrangements would evolve 
differently in different regional contexts, they should reinforce universal human rights 
standards as contained in international human rights instruments. There was strong interest </p>


<p>in further exchanges of that kind to follow developments and cross-fertilize experiences 
among the different regions and parts of Asia and the Pacific. There was also 
encouragement for strengthened cooperation with the United Nations, including OHCHR, 
in promoting and strengthening regional human rights arrangements and the provision of 
technical assistance in that regard. 
</p>
<p>24. Noteworthy in that respect was the process which had been evolving over the past 
two years under the Human Rights Council,3 which brought together the existing regional 
arrangements to explore closer contact and collaboration with each other and with the 
international human rights mechanisms of the United Nations. That had already produced 
an interesting series of meetings and consultations, including the international workshop on 
&#8220;Enhancing cooperation between international and regional human rights mechanisms&#8221; 
organized by OHCHR and held in Geneva on 3 and 4 May 2010. AICHR, Governments, 
NHRIs and NGOs from the Asia-Pacific region were invited to participate in the 
workshop.4 Participants were very much encouraged by the participation of Asia-Pacific 
Member States and regional organizations in that process at the Geneva level and 
regionally, which could be very useful for regions in the early stages of developing regional 
human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>25. The presentation by Mr. George Mukundi focused on the regional human rights 
system in Africa. He reviewed its key legal instruments adopted between 1969 and 2008. 
Some of the key institutions and organs he described included the Assembly and the 
Executive Council of the African Union and the African Commission on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights (ACHPR). He informed participants that ACHPR had 11 members, and 
was today recognized as an independent body. The speaker mentioned that ACHPR held 
two sessions a year, and engaged in promotion work, undertook studies and research, 
organized seminars, assisted NGOs, and made recommendations to Governments, including 
on technical cooperation. He emphasized how in its work ACHPR cooperated with other 
African and international human rights mechanisms. He also informed participants of other 
mechanisms and mandates in the African system, including special rapporteurs and 
working groups. Current challenges to the system that were mentioned included lack of 
implementation and enforcement mechanisms, inadequate financial and human resources, 
and perceived concerns over its independence and impartiality. Regarding the African 
Court on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights (1998) that established the Court entered into force in 2004. He informed 
participants that the Court was based in Arusha, Tanzania, was made up of 11 judges, and 
that in 2008 there had been a decision by the Assembly of the African Union to merge it 
with the African Court of Justice. The speaker noted that the Court faced many challenges, 
including access to the Court by individuals and NGOs, enforcement of decisions, and the 
implications of a merger with the Court of Justice. 
</p>
<p>26. The presentation by Ms. Christina Cerna focused on the development of the Inter-
American human rights system. She informed participants that the American Declaration of 
the Rights and Duties of Man (1948) was originally meant only to be an aspiration, but that 
the Organization of American States (OAS) came to apply it as a legally binding 
instrument. She explained that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (created 
</p>
<p>  
 3 See resolution 12/15 of the Human Rights Council.  
 4 In preparation for the workshop, OHCHR organized in November and December 2009 regional 
</p>
<p>consultations with existing regional human mechanisms in Africa, in Addis Ababa; the Americas, in 
Washington D.C.; and Europe, in Strasbourg. The consultations concluded that cooperation could be 
enhanced in several areas, in particular, in information sharing, possible joint activities and follow-up 
to decisions and recommendations resulting from international and regional human rights 
mechanisms. </p>


<p>in 1959) held four meetings a year, each one to two weeks in duration. Article 9 of the 
Commission&#8217;s Statute was referred to, which provided the Commission with the mandate to 
develop awareness, make recommendations to Governments, prepare studies or reports, 
request Governments to supply information regarding measures adopted pertaining to 
human rights, and serve as an advisory body to the Organization of American States.  
</p>
<p>27. The speaker took note of the evolutionary nature of the Commission, referring to the 
first on-site visit of the Commission in 1961 (to the Dominican Republic) and the 
expansion of its mandate in 1965 allowing it to receive, analyse, investigate and make 
recommendations on individual petitions. She looked in more detail at the important areas 
of work that had been conducted by the Commission over the years, such as the writing of 
country reports, the processing of individual petitions, the hearings held by the 
Commission, the issuance of precautionary measures, and the role it played following the 
establishment of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in 1979. In its role of referring 
cases to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the Commission rejected 
approximately 90 per cent of complaints, as they failed to meet the minimum criteria for 
admissibility, which were the exhaustion of domestic remedies, a six-month statute of 
limitations, the requirement that a petition cannot be pending in another international 
proceeding, and that the facts refer to a violation of the American Convention on Human 
Rights or the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man. If a case reached a 
friendly settlement, the terms of settlement were published in an annual report. The speaker 
emphasized that people more often go to the regional court rather than United Nations 
bodies, as the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights was more responsive in terms 
of making reparations for requesting parties. Ms. Cerna also referred to other instruments 
and mechanisms that made up the Inter-American human rights system, including a system 
of special rapporteurs established to address thematic human rights issues, including 
freedom of expression, the rights of indigenous peoples, the rights of women, the rights of 
children, the rights of persons of African descent and against racial discrimination, the 
situation of migrant workers and their families, and persons deprived of liberty. 
</p>
<p>28. The last presentation, by Mr. Christof Heyns, compared the regional human rights 
systems in Africa, the Americas and Europe. His presentation highlighted the four common 
features of credible regional human rights systems: (a) each are part of a comprehensive 
intergovernmental organization and pursue the human rights objectives of those 
organizations; (b) all have a strong legal basis, (c) all engage in monitoring work; and (d) 
and all have a mandate for human rights promotion <i>and</i> protection, with individuals able to 
lodge complaints.  
</p>
<p>29. The speaker outlined the substantive norms covered in the different regional human 
rights instruments, emphasizing that the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights 
was the only instrument to refer to peoples&#8217; rights. He compared the ratification of United 
Nations human rights instruments in the different regions, observing that Asia and Oceania 
lagged behind the other regions. He highlighted the human rights elements of the 
constitutive instruments of the parent bodies in the different regions, namely the African 
Union, the Organization of American States and the Council of Europe. He described the 
criteria for the appointment of members for the different regional human rights 
mechanisms, and the requirement for independence and impartiality. For instance, in the 
African Commission the Interim Rules of Procedure specified that the position of a member 
of the Commission was incompatible with any activity that might interfere with his or her 
independence or impartiality, such as serving as a member of Government or a diplomatic 
representative. The speaker also compared the complaints procedures of the three regional 
systems, highlighting that all required the exhaustion of local remedies and that the same 
complaint was not being considered by another body. The speaker outlined the reporting 
requirements of the three systems, both for reporting by States and reporting on States, and 
gave an overview of the special procedures mechanisms that had been established. He also </p>


<p>compared the budget and staffing of the three regions, emphasizing that the African system 
was the most constrained by resources. Due to the size of the African region,  the speaker 
pointed out, it had been beneficial to develop human rights mechanisms at the subregional 
level as well. In that regard, he referred to the development of the African Peer Review 
Mechanism, which was a political process along the lines of the universal periodic review 
and provided a review of human rights practices of Member States. He pointed out that 
there might be lessons there for the diverse Asia-Pacific region.  
</p>
<p>30. Regarding the development of credible and effective regional human rights 
mechanisms, the speaker underlined the importance of the political will of the Governments 
involved, as well as that of pressure and support from civil society. He ended by referring 
to the practice of holding moot court sessions as a means of paving the way for the 
development of human rights mechanisms that were able to issue legally binding decisions. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusion  
</b></p>
<p>31. The Bangkok Action Points reflecting the principal elements of the discussion were 
adopted by consensus (see annex). 
</p>
<p>32. In closing, the Secretary of the Workshop, on behalf of the High Commissioner and 
the Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, expressed his deep appreciation to the 
Government of Thailand for hosting the 15th Workshop, and for the warm hospitality 
extended to all participants. He extended thanks to all participants from Member States, 
national human rights institutions, regional organizations, members of the newly 
established AICHR, and the distinguished resource people for their invaluable contributions 
to the meeting, as well as the staff of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Permanent 
Mission of Thailand in Geneva, and OHCHR in Bangkok, Geneva, Cambodia and Nepal. 
</p>
<p>33. The Secretary noted that the discussions had demonstrated the ongoing relevance 
and value of the Asia-Pacific Regional Framework process. Indeed, with the development 
of the new ASEAN human rights system, it was noted that an exciting new stage was 
beginning in the long journey towards a regional human rights system for the diverse and 
dynamic Asia-Pacific region. The meeting showed the degree to which participants could 
learn from each others&#8217; experiences and the different regional models which had evolved, 
in developing effective regional mechanisms which added value to the needs of the regional 
community and at the same time reflected and reinforced international human rights 
standards. The Secretary emphasized that OHCHR was very committed to accompanying 
the States Members of the United Nations and other stakeholders of the region on that 
journey and to facilitate the exchange of technical assistance and comparative experience 
along the way. The Secretary also noted the appreciation of the strong partnerships that had 
developed with national human rights institutions and civil society, which would continue 
to be such an important driving force in that process.
