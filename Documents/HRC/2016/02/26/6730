<p><b>Algeria (on behalf of the African Group):  Draft resolution 
5/&#8230; Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate-holders  
</b></p>
<p><b>of the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i> Guided</i> by the aims and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and recognizing the ensuing obligations inter alia of 
States to cooperate in promoting universal respect for human rights as enshrined therein, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted on 25 June 1993 by 
the World Conference on Human Rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> <i>also</i> that in resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, entitled &#8220;Human Rights 
Council&#8221;, the General Assembly: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Reaffirmed that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interrelated, 
interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that all human rights must be treated in a fair and 
equal manner on the same footing and with the same emphasis; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Acknowledged that peace and security, development and human rights are the pillars 
of the United Nations system and that they are interlinked and mutually reinforcing; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Decided that members elected to the Council shall uphold the highest standards in 
the promotion and protection of human rights and shall fully cooperate with the Council; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Stressed the importance of &#8220;ensuring universality, objectivity and non-selectivity in 
the consideration of human rights issues, and the elimination of double standards and 
politicization&#8221;; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) Further recognized that the promotion and protection of human rights &#8220;should be 
based on the principles of cooperation and genuine dialogue and aimed at strengthening the 
capacity of Member States to comply with their human rights obligations for the benefit of all 
human beings&#8221;; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) Decided that &#8220;the work of the Council shall be guided by the principles of 
universality, impartiality, objectivity, and non-selectivity, constructive international dialogue and 
cooperation, with a view to enhancing the promotion and protection of all human rights, civil, 
political, economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to development&#8221;; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) Also decided that &#8220;the methods of work of the Council shall be transparent, fair and 
impartial and shall enable genuine dialogue, be results-oriented, allow for subsequent follow-up 
discussions to recommendations and their implementation and also allow for substantive 
interaction with special procedures and mechanisms&#8221;; </p>
<p><i> Underlining</i> the centrality of the notions of impartiality and objectivity, as well as the 
expertise of mandate-holders, within the context of special procedures, along with the need to 
give the required degree of attention to all human rights violations, wherever they may be taking 
place, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>that the efficiency of the system of special procedures should be 
reinforced through the consolidation of the status of mandate-holders and the adoption of 
principles and regulations taking the specificities of their mandate into consideration, </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Considering</i> that it is necessary to assist all stakeholders, including States, national human 
rights institutions, non-governmental organizations and individuals, to better understand and 
support the activities of mandate-holders, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>articles 100, 104, 105 of the Charter of the United Nations, section 22 of 
article VI of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations 
of 13 February 1946 and paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>decision 1/102 of 30 June 2006, in which the Council decided to extend 
exceptionally for one year the mandates and mandate-holders of the special procedures of the 
Commission on Human Rights of the Sub-Commission for the Promotion and Protection of 
Human Rights as well as the procedure established pursuant to Economic and Social Council 
resolution 1503 (XLVIII) of 27 May 1970, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting</i> <i>also </i>decision 1/104 of 30 June 2006, in which the Council established the 
Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group entrusted with the task of formulating 
recommendations on the issue of the review, and possibly the enhancement and rationalization, 
of all mandates, mechanisms, functions and responsibilities of the Commission on Human 
Rights, in order to maintain a regime of special procedures in accordance with paragraph 6 of 
General Assembly resolution 60/251, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting further </i>resolution 2/1 of 27 November 2006, in which the Council requested the 
Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group to &#8220;draft a code of conduct regulating the work 
of the special procedures&#8221;, 
</p>
<p><i> Considering</i> that this code of conduct is an integral part of the review, improvement and 
rationalization called for in General Assembly resolution 60/251 that, inter alia, seeks to enhance 
the cooperation between Governments and mandate-holders which is essential for the effective 
functioning of the system, 
</p>
<p><i> Considering</i> <i>also </i>that such a code of conduct will strengthen the capacity of 
mandate-holders to exercise their functions whilst enhancing their moral authority and credibility 
and will require supportive action by other stakeholders, and in particular by States, </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Considering</i> <i>further </i>that one should distinguish between, on the one hand, the 
independence of mandate-holders, which is absolute in nature, and, on the other hand, their 
prerogatives, as circumscribed by their mandate, the mandate of the Human Rights Council, and 
the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i> Mindful of the fact</i> that it is desirable to spell out, complete and increase the visibility of 
the rules and principles governing the behaviour of mandate-holders, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>the Regulations Governing the Status, Basic Rights and Duties of Officials other 
than Secretariat Officials, and Experts on Mission that was adopted by the General Assembly in 
resolution 56/280 of 27 March 2002, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting</i> <i>also </i>the draft Manual of the United Nations Human Rights Special Procedures 
adopted in 1999 by the sixth annual meeting of mandate-holders, as revised, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note</i> of the deliberations and proposals of the Open-ended Intergovernmental 
Working Group<b> </b>on<b> </b>Review of Mandates, 
</p>
<p> 1.<i> Urges<b> </b></i>all States to cooperate with, and assist, the special procedures in the 
performance of their tasks and to provide all information in a timely manner, as well as respond 
to communications transmitted to them by the special procedures without undue delay; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Adopts</i> the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate-Holders of the Human 
Rights Council, the text of which is annexed to the present resolution and whose provisions 
should be disseminated by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights, to the mandate-holders, to the Member States of the United Nations and to other 
concerned parties. </p>
