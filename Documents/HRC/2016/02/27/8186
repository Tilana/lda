<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Independent Expert in the field of cultural rights, Farida Shaheed, visited 
Austria from 5 to 15 April 2011, at the invitation of the Government. The mission was the 
first official visit to Austria by an expert appointed by the Human Rights Council. The 
Independent Expert&#8223;s visit included Vienna, Burgenland, Carinthia and Styria. 
</p>
<p>2. During her mission, the Independent Expert met with senior officials at the federal, 
federal provinces (Landers) and municipal levels dealing with all aspects of cultural rights 
as well as in the areas of education, population statistics, women&#8223;s issues, minority issues, 
</p>
<p>the media, internal and foreign affairs. She also engaged with public institutions working in 
the field of culture and media, equality and redress. She met UNESCO Austria and 
interacted with academics, civil society organizations, representatives of minority 
associations and religious groups.  
</p>
<p>3. The expert visited a number of community projects and public-private partnership 
initiatives that facilitate people&#8223;s access to and ability to contribute to cultural life and that 
</p>
<p>promote cultural diversity in Vienna, Graz, Eisenstadt and Klagenfurt. She was able to see 
multilingual educational institutions and projects of minority associations that promote the 
use of minority languages and safeguard cultural traditions as living heritage.  
</p>
<p>4. In the course of the visit, the Independent Expert assessed the realization of the 
cultural rights of all persons in Austria and the measures adopted by the Government to 
promote cultural diversity and to foster intercultural as well as inter-religious dialogue. She 
studied the relevant normative and institutional framework, and looked particularly at the 
achievements and challenges in the realization of cultural rights of national, ethnic, 
religious and linguistic minorities, migrants, as well as persons with disabilities and those 
living in relative poverty. 
</p>
<p>5. The Independent Expert thanks the Government of Austria for the opportunity to 
examine the situation of cultural rights in the country. She extends her thanks to all 
stakeholders and interlocutors for their time, information and insights. 
</p>
<p>6. In the present report, the Independent Expert presents her observations and 
recommendations in the spirit of fostering further cooperation and with a view to 
contributing to the efforts to strengthen cultural rights in Austria.  
</p>
<p><b> II. General background  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The federal administrative framework  
</b></p>
<p>7. Austria is a federal republic comprised of nine independent Federal Provinces: 
Burgenland, Carinthia, Lower Austria, Upper Austria, Salzburg, Styria, Tyrol, Vorarlberg 
and Vienna. These administrative districts, called &#8220;L&#228;nder&#8221; in German, have some 
autonomy, including constitutional authority to enact certain legislation and take 
administrative decisions. Nevertheless, most public affairs fall under the competence of the 
federal authority: L&#228;nder do not have a stand-alone judiciary, have comparatively few 
actual legislative powers and rely for most of their budget on the federal government. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/26/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p><b> B. Ethnic, linguistic and religious diversity 
</b></p>
<p>8. Austria is a culturally diverse society enriched by communities from various ethnic, 
linguistic and religious backgrounds. According to the 2011 register-based census, the total 
population in Austria exceeded 8.4 million inhabitants.1 In 2009, 1,468 million people 
residing in Austria had a migrant background, 385,500 being second-generation migrants 
and 1,082 million first-generation migrants.2 Currently, the number of foreign nationals 
living in Austria is 957,000, approximately 11 per cent of the population.3 Nationals from 
all countries of former Yugoslavia represent the largest group of immigrants, followed by 
those from Germany and Turkey.4 Other foreign nationals include people from other States 
in Europe, as well as Africa, Asia and America. Austria is also home to 13 different 
religious communities. 
</p>
<p>9. Six national minorities, called &#8220;ethnic groups&#8221; in national laws, are officially 
recognized in Austria: Hungarians, Croats, Slovenes, Czechs, Roma and Sinti, and Slovaks. 
Other minorities, such as the Jenische and the Poles, are not recognized as national 
minorities.  
</p>
<p>10. A decade ago, the 2001 census enumerated 25,884 Austrian citizens using 
Hungarian as their colloquial language concentrated in Burgenland and Vienna; 19,374 
Burgenland Croatian-speaking citizens; 17,953 Slovene-speaking citizens mainly in 
Carinthia and Styria; 11,035-Czech speaking citizens mostly living in Vienna and Lower 
Austria; 4,348 Romanes-speaking citizens mostly in the eastern part of the country, 
particularly Burgenland, Vienna and Lower Austria; and 3,343 Slovak-speaking citizens in 
the eastern regions of Austria.5 Members of national minorities have been migrating in 
large numbers to other regions of Austria, mainly to the city of Vienna. Today, the capital 
city is home to Croats, Roma, Slovaks, Czechs, and Hungarians as well as a vast number of 
migrants. The current number of people belonging to ethnic minorities is unknown since 
the 2011 census did not include information on ethnic background or language. 
</p>
<p>11. The Austrian legal framework on ethnic minorities grants particular rights to 
officially recognized national minorities residing in their historical settlements in the 
L&#228;nder. In particular, any community with a sufficient number of residents belonging to a 
national minority is required to provide for bilingual topographic signs, education and for 
the use of minority language(s) in official dealings. Recognized national minorities also 
benefit from earmarked federal funds to safeguard and promote their cultures. These rights 
are not afforded to members of these communities who opt to live outside the specified 
L&#228;nder settlements. 
</p>
<p>12. In line with the multi-ethnic and multicultural background that forms Austrian 
society, the Government has put into place a number of initiatives and regulations to 
promote cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue, as well as to facilitate access to 
culture for all, including minorities, migrants and persons with disabilities. However, a 
number of obstacles hinder the full realization of cultural rights in the country, particularly

<p>the fragmentation of policies and regulations, a relatively narrow perspective on preserving 
cultural communities, an assimilationist approach to inclusion, and the insufficient 
implementation of rights of minorities and disadvantaged groups. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Normative and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The legal framework for the protection of human rights  
</b></p>
<p>13. In its 2010 report submitted under the universal periodic review, Austria indicated 
that human rights are enshrined in its 1867 Basic Law on the General Rights of Nationals, 
which provides for a number of important guarantees of fundamental rights, such as the 
principle of equality, and freedoms of belief and conscience, opinion, and assembly, as well 
as academic and artistic freedom, and the right to property.6 It also indicated that the 
European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, 
which it adopted in 1958, was granted constitutional status in 1964. The rights laid down in 
the Convention are thus directly applicable before Austrian courts and administrative 
authorities.7   
</p>
<p>14. Other constitutional laws incorporating human rights include the Federal 
Constitutional Law on the Prohibition of all Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Federal 
Constitutional Law on the Protection of Personal Freedom, and the 1862 Act on the 
Protection of the Rights of the Home.8 
</p>
<p>15. Austria has ratified most international human rights instruments. It is not a party, 
however, to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of all Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families, or the Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, inter alia.  
</p>
<p>16. Austria has ratified most of the Council of Europe treaties on human rights and 
culture. However, it is not yet party to, inter alia, Protocol No. 12 of the European 
Convention on Human Rights (which includes a general prohibition on discrimination), the 
Framework Convention on the Value of Cultural Heritage for Society (Faro Convention), 
the Convention on the Participation of Foreigners in Public Life at Local Level, and the 
European Convention on the Legal Status of Migrant Workers. 
</p>
<p>17. Economic, social and cultural rights are not provided for in the Federal Constitution 
and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is not directly 
applicable, despite numerous recommendations by international bodies.9 The incorporation 
of economic, social and cultural rights into the Federal Constitution is currently being 
debated.10 In addition, the Constitution does not recognize other human rights, such as the 
rights of the child, the right to asylum, or a general prohibition against discrimination.11  
</p>
<p>18. With regard to discrimination, Austria has adopted a number of laws associated with 
different procedures and institutions. The 1979 Equal Treatment Act was revised in 2004 
and prohibits discrimination in working life on the basis of ethnic origin, religion, age, 
gender and sexual orientation. It also proscribes discrimination on the basis of ethnic origin

<p>in the fields of social protection and benefits, education, and access to public goods and 
services including housing. However, the Act does not apply to the provisions and 
conditions governing the entry of third-country nationals or stateless persons or their 
residence or to any treatment resulting from the legal status of third-country nationals or 
stateless persons. In 2006, Austria adopted the Equal Treatment for Persons with 
Disabilities Act, prohibiting direct and indirect discrimination against persons with 
disabilities. Although a number of relevant regulations have been adopted, the fragmented 
legal framework on non-discrimination does not provide a coherent and comprehensive 
basis for combating discrimination in Austria, as observed by the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination in 2008.12  
</p>
<p>19. The Independent Expert subscribes to this view. She also notes with concern the 
lack of consideration of human rights as a cross-cutting issue in Austria&#8223;s legislation and 
the lack of a comprehensive human rights catalogue.   
</p>
<p><b> B. The national legal framework protecting the rights of minorities 
</b></p>
<p>20. The 1867 Basic Law on the General Rights of Nationals, adopted in the context of 
the Austro-Hungarian Compromise, provided for dual sovereignty: the Austrian Empire and 
the Kingdom of Hungary. The Austro-Hungarian Empire ruled over various Slavic groups 
including Croats, Czechs, Poles, Rusyns, Serbs, Slovaks, Slovenes and Ukrainians, as well 
as large Italian and Romanian communities. Article 19 of the Basic Law establishes that all 
ethnic entities of the empire shall enjoy equal rights and have an inviolable right to the 
preservation of their nationality and language. It stipulates the &#8220;equal rights of all existing 
</p>
<p>languages in schools, administration and public life&#8221;, and stresses that in countries 
populated by more than one ethnic entity, members of each ethnic entity should have 
adequate opportunity to receive education in their own language. Last amended in 1988, the 
Basic Law has constitutional status. 
</p>
<p>21. The Republic of Austria emerged in 1918 with the Treaty of St. Germain. The State 
Treaty of Saint Germain ensures equal treatment and security de jure and de facto to 
members of racial, religious or linguistic minorities. It sets out the obligation to ensure the 
use of minority languages before the courts and to provide primary school instruction in 
minority languages in districts with a sizeable population belonging to a racial, religious or 
linguistic minority. Moreover, it guarantees an equitable share of public funds to be granted 
to these minorities for educational, religious and charitable purposes.13  
</p>
<p>22. The Austrian Constitution, first enacted in 1920, is an extensive collection of legal 
provisions which, over the years, have attained constitutional status. The 2000 amendment 
of the Federal Constitutional Law enshrines the commitment of Austria to protect the rights 
of minorities in a new Article 8. Through article 8, the Republic subscribes to its linguistic 
and cultural multiplicity reflected in its indigenous ethnic groups, and guarantees to respect 
and preserve their existence, language and culture. The article introduces the term 
&#8220;autochthonous&#8221; into legal texts for the first time. 
</p>
<p>23. The 1955 State Treaty of Vienna recognizes the right of Austrian citizens in 
Carinthia, Burgenland and Styria, as members of the Slovenian and Croatian minorities, to 
use their own languages in schools, administrative and judicial procedures, and 
topographical signs.14

 14 Austrian State Treaty, 1955, art. 7. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/26/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>24. The 1976 Law on Ethnic Groups, enabling the implementation of the State Treaty, 
defines ethnic groups as &#8220;such groups of Austrian citizens living in parts of the Federal 
</p>
<p>territory and having a language other than German as mother tongue and having traditions 
of their own&#8221;.15 To ensure their recognition, the Act stipulates taking into account &#8220;the 
number of members of the ethnic group, the areas of the territory they live in, the ratio of 
their number as compared with other citizens of Austria in a particular area as well as their 
particular needs and interests&#8221;,16 and considering &#8220;the results of data collected by official 
statistics&#8221;17 for this purpose. The act regulates the use of topographic names in bilingual 
areas and the use of the minority language in official interactions with public institutions.18 
It restricts the right to bilingual signs and place names to areas where the ethnic minority 
makes up at least 25 per cent of the population. The Act provides for the establishment of 
ethnic group advisory boards to advise the Federal Government and Ministers on matters 
regarding their particular community, and stipulates the provision of financial support to 
ethnic groups for activities and projects aimed at preserving their cultural communities.19  
</p>
<p>25. There is a debate among legal scholars on whether article 19 of the 1867 Basic Law 
on the General Rights of Nationals has been derogated by the more recent and more 
restrictive provisions of the 1920 State Treaty of St. Germain and the 1955 State Treaty of 
Vienna, thus disputing its applicability to minorities living in contemporary Austria. The 
matter has not been resolved yet; however the doctrine supports applicability. A 2000 
government proposal to abolish article 19 was vehemently opposed by the minorities, and 
eventually withdrawn. 
</p>
<p>26. The Independent Expert welcomes the legislative framework adopted in Austria to 
safeguard the cultural rights of ethnic minorities and to ensure the use of their languages in 
schools, topographic signs, and administrative or judicial procedures. She is concerned, 
however, that most of these rights are only guaranteed to the minority population as long as 
they reside in the historical settlement areas. These rights are not guaranteed outside these 
settlements. Consequently, there is a differentiated treatment of members of the same 
minority depending on their physical location. Moreover, the prevalent demographic 
tendencies of urbanization and rural depopulation mean that an increasing number of 
persons from recognized minorities are losing these cultural rights. In this regard, the 
Independent Expert is concerned about statistical data collection, the results of which are to 
be considered for granting rights (see below). 
</p>
<p><b>  Statistical data collection  
</b></p>
<p>27. Statistical information related to minority communities is a matter of concern. The 
2001 Population Census was the last &#8220;traditional&#8221; census using enumerators and 
</p>
<p>questionnaires in a survey to collect empirical data. As of 2011, the population census is 
carried out using existing statistical registers, administrative registers and databases to 
obtain most of the information typically surveyed in traditional censuses.20 This marks a 
turning point in the methodology used to collect statistical information on population, in 
which the desired information is not collected from citizens and residents, but extracted 
from pre-existing administrative registers that typically collate information for other 
purposes.

<p><b>A/HRC/20/26/Add.1

</p>
<p>28. According to the authorities, the rationale underpinning this change is that register-
based censuses are substantially less expensive, use information already available in 
registers, enable faster results, and thus can be conducted more frequently. In addition, 
register censuses are meant to provide better data protection compared to a conventional 
census where personnel conducting the interviews often live in the same municipality as the 
respondent, and may therefore know them personally, undermining anonymity.21  
</p>
<p>29. Led by Statistik Austria, the new register census does not collect information on 
ethnic background and colloquial language, or on religion.22 According to the authorities, 
there is insufficient register information on these topics to merit their inclusion.23 
Authorities also suggest that excluding ethnic background, colloquial languages and 
religion would avoid stigmatizing members of minority groups. 
</p>
<p>30. Members of national minorities have stated that in the past many people avoided 
answering questions on ethnic background and quantification of minorities in national 
statistics for several reasons, including historical trauma and personal fears, a reported lack 
of anonymity in the data collection process, and the biased or misleading manner in which 
questions pertaining to linguistic affiliation had been formulated.24 Nevertheless, most 
academics and civil society organizations, including representatives of virtually all 
minorities, believe that it is important to document such information. 
</p>
<p>31. The Independent Expert appreciates the sensitivity of the issue. However, she is 
concerned that the lack of updated and reliable information on the number of people 
pertaining to minority groups may misrepresent their weight in Austrian society and, even 
more problematically, affect the rights to which they are entitled. The elimination of a 
comprehensive survey impedes adequate statistical assessment of cultural diversity in terms 
of linguistic and ethnic minorities, religious communities and migrant backgrounds of 
Austrian nationals. The absence of this information will impede effective planning to 
protect cultural rights and promote diversity in Austrian society. Moreover, this precludes 
any new group from being recognized as an autochthonous community, effectively 
blocking the possibility of providing other minority groups with the entitlements now 
afforded to recognized indigenous groups. It also does not seem to be in keeping with the 
spirit of the Constitution&#8223;s new Article 8. 
</p>
<p>32. The Independent Expert shares the view of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination, which, in 2008, recommended that Austria &#8220;conduct censuses and 
collect data, including on the basis of the use of mother tongues, languages commonly 
spoken or other indicators of ethnic diversity, together with any information derived from 
targeted social surveys conducted on a voluntary basis, with full respect for the privacy and 
anonymity of the individuals concerned, in order to obtain accurate information on all 
ethnic groups living in the territory of the State party.&#8221;25 
</p>
<p>33. She concurs with the concern of the Advisory Committee on the Framework 
Convention for the Protection of National Minorities regarding the shortage of reliable data 
on the socio-economic and educational situation of persons belonging to national minorities 
in Austria. The Committee recalled that &#8220;data collection on the situation of minorities is 
crucial to the development of adequate anti-discrimination policies and of specific policies

<p>to improve equal opportunities for persons belonging to national minorities&#8221;.26 The 
Advisory Committee reiterated this view in its Third Opinion on Austria, issued in 
December 2011. 27 
</p>
<p>34. The Independent Expert also echoes the opinion of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination, which expressed its concern about the &#8220;distinction 
[made] between autochthonous minorities and other minority groups&#8221; as well as about &#8220;the 
application of a different treatment to individuals belonging to &#8222;autochthonous national 
</p>
<p>minorities&#8223; residing in the so-called &#8222;historical settlement areas (&#8230;) and individuals who do 
not reside in those settlements areas.&#8221;28 She reiterates the 2011 Third Opinion on Austria of 
the Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National 
Minorities urging the Government to ensure a more consistent and inclusive application of 
minority rights in Austria, including through comprehensive amendments to the Law on 
Ethnic Groups and relevant constitutional provisions.29 
</p>
<p><b> C. Institutions of redress and relief  
</b></p>
<p>35. A number of bodies have been established in Austria for the protection and 
promotion of human rights.  
</p>
<p>36. The Austrian Ombudsman Board is an independent institution with constitutional 
status mandated to monitor Austria&#8223;s public administration, check the legality of decisions 
</p>
<p>made therein, and examine allegations of malpractice by public authorities. It is also 
mandated to mediate between individuals and public authorities and to refer laws and 
ordinances for review to the Constitutional Court. The board consists of three members 
appointed by the parliament who report back to it.30   
</p>
<p>37. The Human Rights Advisory Board, established in 1999, is mandated to visit places 
where people are detained by law enforcement officers and to monitor the use of force by 
authority. Additionally, it advises the Ministry of the Interior on human rights matters. The 
direct monitoring functions of the board are delegated to six regional commissions. The 
Advisory Board is attached to the Federal Ministry of the Interior and its 11 members, some 
of whom are members of civil society, are appointed by the Minister of the Interior.31 
Although operational autonomy is purportedly guaranteed by a constitutional provision in 
the Security Police Act, the placement of the Board within the Ministry of the Interior 
raises concerns. The independence of this body from government authorities could be 
further guaranteed by locating it outside of the Ministry, under parliamentary oversight.

<p>38. The Equal Treatment Commission was established in 1979 to deal with gender-
based discrimination in employment. Its mandate was expanded in 2004 to monitor issues 
relating to discrimination under the amended Equal Treatment Act. The Commission deals 
with both general questions and individual cases of discrimination. If it finds 
discrimination, it recommends actions to combat it. The Commission&#8223;s rulings are not 
binding, however. The Commission&#8223;s three Senates deal with equal treatment in

<p>origin in other areas.32 Discrimination against non-nationals falls outside the Commission&#8223;s 
remit. 
</p>
<p>39. In 2005, Austria established three bodies to assist the Commission: the Ombud for 
Equal Treatment in employment irrespective of gender, the Ombud for Equal Treatment in 
employment irrespective of ethnicity, religion or belief, age or sexual orientation in 
employment, and the Ombud for Equal Treatment irrespective of ethnicity and gender in 
other areas. The Ombud for Equal Treatment provides legal support to the victims of 
discrimination and brings cases to the Equal Treatment Commission, which is the decision-
making body. The Ombud for Equal Treatment has no competence to participate in Court 
proceedings as a third party and has limited human and financial resources.33  
</p>
<p>40. Other relevant institutions are the Ombudsperson offices for persons with 
disabilities, and for children and youth. Similarly, many federal provinces and 
municipalities have established their own ombudsperson institutions on these issues. 
Additionally, a number of academic institutes carry out substantive work on human rights 
issues.34 
</p>
<p>41. While the commissions and ombudsperson offices function well, Austria does not 
yet have a comprehensive institutional and legislative framework for the protection and 
promotion of human rights. No national human rights institution in Austria meets the 
requirements of the Principles Relating to the Status of National Institutions (the Paris 
Principles). In 2000 and 2011, the Austrian Ombudsman Board was accredited B status (not 
fully in compliance with Paris Principles) by the International Coordinating Committee of 
National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights.35 Various 
international bodies have urged Austria to establish a national human rights institution 
within the meaning of the Paris Principles. The creation of an independent human rights 
institution, separate from the executive and possessing a comprehensive and clearly defined 
mandate to monitor human rights across the country and receive complaints, should be a 
priority of the Austrian Government. 
</p>
<p>42. Austria has not yet adopted a national human rights action plan, nor is there 
evidence of a human rights-based approach to policymaking. A number of measures are 
routinely adopted in the area of human rights, but public policies are scattered and 
uncoordinated. The adoption of a comprehensive and coherent policy framework in the area 
of human rights should be a priority of the Austrian Government. The lack of a national 
human rights institution and action plan combined with the insufficient domestication of 
international human rights obligations, particularly in the field of economic, social and 
cultural rights, and the highly restricted possibilities for collective action before courts, 
weakens the protection of rights.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Cultural rights for all in Austria 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The right to access, participate in and contribute to cultural life

<p>43. The Independent Expert welcomes a number of positive initiatives and good 
practices adopted in Austria to ensure the right to access, to participate in and contribute to 
cultural life by all persons, including those belonging to marginalized groups. Interesting

<p>measures adopted by the Federal and Lander governments to increase access to culture, 
include: (a) measures to increase access for youth, such as free access to all Federal 
Museums for young people up to the age of 19; (b) measures to facilitate access to culture 
for persons with disabilities; and (c) schemes enabling people with low incomes to 
participate in cultural life and cultural activities, such as the Kulturpass initiative that offers 
people living in precarious financial circumstances the opportunity to enjoy art and culture 
free of charge. The Government also supports numerous private initiatives aimed at 
promoting intercultural exchanges among members of different communities, such as the 
excellent Brunnenpassage initiative in Vienna, where people from different nationalities, 
ages and socio-cultural backgrounds participate together in community arts projects. The 
initiative fosters mutual understanding and learning from each other. Accessibility is 
ensured to all, with free-of-charge participation and a team that speaks nine languages. 
</p>
<p>44. The Independent Expert is of the view, however, that effective action to enhance the 
implementation of cultural rights remains scattered, is poorly known, lacks feedback 
mechanisms and often receives ad-hoc financial support which impedes longer-term 
strategic planning. On occasion, decisions by public authorities concerning the funding of 
these initiatives are considered to lack transparency. An institutional framework would 
facilitate up-scaling, having a multiplier effect by building on lessons learned.  
</p>
<p>45. Persons belonging to minorities, in particular the Roma and non-recognized 
minorities, migrants and socially disadvantaged people continue to face challenges in their 
access to cultural activities; theatres, opera houses and museums are still mostly frequented 
by a limited, educated public.36 Of concern are numerous cases reported of discrimination 
against persons of African, Latin-American or Roma origin being denied access to public 
places, such as bars or discotheques. Of the 21,500 migrants from African countries 
residing in Austria (0.3 per cent of the total population), 54 per cent live in Vienna.37 
Africans in Austria face ongoing obstacles in accessing cultural life, employment and 
accommodation. In 2010, a positive precedent was set when a civil society organization 
supported the submission of a formal complaint by a black individual who had been refused 
entrance to a jazz bar on racist grounds. The night club was ordered to pay a &#8364;1,440 Euro 
fine in compensation to the victim.38  
</p>
<p>46. The Independent Expert notes that members of some minorities often face double 
discrimination in their access to culture because ethnic and national minorities are often 
also less secure economically. The expansion of initiatives and the adoption of a more 
comprehensive and systematic approach to make culture accessible to all would enable 
targeted policies to better support the cultural rights of all, particularly minorities and 
disadvantaged groups. 
</p>
<p><b>  Persons with disabilities  
</b></p>
<p>47. The Equal Treatment for Persons with Disabilities Act came into force in Austria in 
</p><p>2006.  It prohibits direct and indirect discrimination against persons with disabilities and 
provides that relatives fall under the protection of the Act.  The Federal Constitutional Law 
recognizes Austrian sign language as an independent language.39 Following ratification by 
Austria of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2008, the 
Government amended the Federal Disability Act to create a national monitoring

(the Equal Treatment Commission does not cover discrimination related to disabilities.) A 
consultative process is currently under way for the development of a national plan of action 
on disabilities, bringing together federal ministries and civil society representatives. 
According to information given by the Government, the Action Plan is expected to be 
adopted in 2012. 
</p>
<p>48. Initiatives of the Federal and L&#228;nder governments to improve access to cultural life 
for people with disabilities include funding and support provided for participation in sports; 
the establishment of barrier-free visitor facilities and infrastructure; subsidies for 
recreational offers and communications facilities; and measures to improve accessibility of 
cultural and arts facilities, inter alia.41  
</p>
<p>49. However, representatives of associations of persons with disabilities informed the 
Independent Expert of the limitations experienced in accessing cultural life and education. 
Obstacles include: the lack of a comprehensive national accessibility policy; insufficient 
funding and availability of services offered to persons with disabilities; construction-related 
barriers that prevent persons with disabilities from fully participating in cultural life; 
deficient inclusion and support for persons with disabilities in the education system or in 
the field of work; the fact that Austrian Sign Language is not a language of instruction and 
the lack of requirement for sign language competency for kindergarten and school teachers; 
insufficient availability of information in alternative means of communication (such as 
Braille, sign language, and Lorm&#8223;s alphabet); the lack of cultural opportunities for people 
with learning disabilities; insufficient measures for the realization of independent living; 
and the limited use of subtitles in public and private television broadcasting.42 
</p>
<p>50. Those interviewed were also concerned that persons with disabilities continue to be 
portrayed in the media as needing charity, rather than as fully entitled rights-holders,43 and 
emphasized the need for a shift in paradigm from one of exclusion and pity, to one of 
inclusion, self-determination and entitlement. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The right to enjoy one's own culture 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Recognized national minority groups 
</b></p>
<p>51. The official recognition of ethnic, linguistic and religious diversity in Austria, and 
the codification of the right to use minority languages in education, topographical signs and 
administrative or judicial procedures, provides an important base for promoting cultural 
rights and cultural diversity in Austria. However, the Independent Expert has received 
numerous reports about the insufficient implementation of these rights. 
</p>
<p><b>  Bilingual topographic signs 
</b></p>
<p>52. The issue of bilingual road signs in Carinthia has been controversial since the 1970s. 
In response to numerous complaints submitted by members of national minorities, in 2001 
the Constitutional Court ruled that the threshold requirement of 25 per cent minority 
population for bilingual topographic signs in the Law on Ethnic Groups does not conform 
to article 7, paragraph 3 of the State Treaty of Vienna and is therefore unconstitutional. The

</b></p>
<p>Court ruled that it is sufficient for a national minority to constitute more than 10 per cent of 
the total population in an area over a long period of time, to entitle its inhabitants to display 
bilingual signs. The Court also expressed its opinion that the results of the population 
census, and not other parameters, were decisive in this regard.44 This reinforces the concern 
that the lack of statistical data collection on ethnic background and colloquial language in 
population censuses may impede fair implementation of this provision.  
</p>
<p>53. The Independent Expert is concerned that the Constitutional Court ruling on 
bilingual topographic signs in Carinthia has not been implemented. In June 2010, 10 years 
after the decision, negotiations between Slovene minority representatives and federal, 
L&#228;nder and local authorities led to the adoption of a compromise concerning bilingual 
signposts and the use of Slovene as an official language in Carinthia, putting an end to a 
long-standing dispute. However, the agreed threshold of 17.5 per cent remains far higher 
than &#8220;at least 10 per cent&#8221;, as set by the Constitutional Court in its 2001 ruling.45 
</p>
<p>54. Based on the compromise, a new proposal for amendments to the Law on Ethnic 
Groups has been approved by the Council of Ministers and sent to the parliament for 
approval. The Independent Expert is concerned that, although the amendment will affect all 
minorities in Austria, consultations with members of other national minorities, such as 
Croat and Hungarian minorities have not been held. Since the amendment is expected to be 
made at the constitutional level, once approved it will bar the possibility for national 
minorities to challenge its constitutionality before the Constitutional Court,46 making 
appropriate consultation particularly important. 
</p>
<p><b>  Bilingual education 
</b></p>
<p>55. During her mission, the Independent Expert visited bilingual schools in areas of 
historical settlement and in Vienna. She was impressed with the commitment of teachers 
and principals to provide adequate bilingual education and access to textbooks in minority 
languages. She observed the beneficial impact that this teaching system has in promoting 
cultural diversity as an integral part of children&#8223;s development, and in terms of their 
behaviour towards minority cultures and languages. She noted with satisfaction that, due to 
the inclusion of minority languages in the school curricula, children of national minorities 
have developed a sense of pride in using their colloquial language.  
</p>
<p>56. Notwithstanding efforts to comply with the provisions of the Law on Ethnic Groups, 
bilingual education in schools and kindergartens is actually rare in Austria. Only a few 
genuinely bilingual kindergarten and primary level schools exist, particularly in Burgenland 
and Carinthia, but they remain highly dependent on the personal efforts of individual 
teachers and principals to operate effectively. Minority languages are mostly taught as 
elective courses, with Hungarian and especially Romani facing considerable challenges. 
Classes are held only a few hours per week and are not subject to learning standards. 
Certificates of proficiency are not provided for minority languages, reducing the interest of 
students in continuing their language studies. Members of the Croat and Hungarian 
minorities expressed concern about the continued decline in knowledge of their minority 
languages among the youth. 
</p>
<p>57. Opportunities for bilingual education for members of national minorities outside 
Burgenland and Carinthia are limited. In Vienna, some private initiatives exist, including 
bilingual Slovak and Czech schools, but they lack public funding. Hungarian and Roma 
people face particular challenges in accessing bilingual education in the capital city, with

<p>Hungarian being mostly taught by national minority organizations. Slovene education in 
Styria remains limited. Some bilingual primary schools opened in other areas, such as Graz, 
are doing well.  
</p>
<p>58. The availability of textbooks for and in all minority languages is inadequate, with a 
particular shortage of material in Romani and related to Roma culture. As pointed out by 
some of those interviewed, despite the efforts of some universities and pedagogical 
institutions to offer training in national minority languages, teachers and principals 
proficient in minority languages are scarce.47 The Independent Expert, however, commends 
the efforts made by the Government to codify into a single script the six Romani languages 
most frequently spoken in Austria and the introduction of instruction of and in Romani 
thanks to this codification. 
</p>
<p>59. Roma people face numerous challenges with regards to education, including 
academic underachievement, high drop-out rates, overrepresentation of Roma children in 
special remedial classes, and underrepresentation in higher level education.  Opportunities 
for studying Romani are very limited, particularly outside of Burgenland.48 
</p>
<p><b>  Official use of minority languages 
</b></p>
<p>60. In 1996, the Constitutional Court ruled that the members of Austrian minorities 
throughout the country are entitled to have their personal documents (birth certificates, 
marriage certificates, death certificates) also issued in their mother tongues.49 In 2000, the 
Constitutional Court ruled that in conformity with article 7 of the State Treaty of Vienna of 
1955, Slovene as an official language had to be allowed in municipalities having a 10 per 
cent Slovene population over a longer period of time.50 This last ruling remains 
unimplemented.  
</p>
<p>61. The right to use minority languages in official and administrative procedures in the 
historical settlement areas is facing a number of obstacles that impede effective 
implementation. Representatives of minority groups reported an insufficient will on the part 
of civil servants to facilitate the use of minority languages in official proceedings, and the 
overall lack of proficiency among officials in minority languages. They also complained of 
a lack of bilingual forms for administrative procedures. When forms are translated and 
made available in a minority language, these can only be used as an aid for filling out the 
official German language form. Moreover, proceedings launched in national minority 
languages are said to be treated with less diligence and take comparatively longer to 
process.51 This, interlocutors pointed out, strongly discourages people from pursuing 
matters in their own language.  
</p>
<p><b>  Funding 
</b></p>
<p>62. The Advisory Councils for the National Minorities advise federal and local 
authorities on matters concerning their particular community and make recommendations 
on how to allocate the earmarked funds. Funding for cultural activities of national 
minorities is disbursed by Federal Ministries and the L&#228;nders in areas of historical 
settlement and in the city of Vienna. Minority representatives expressed frustration at the 
limited funding received (for example, the funding from the Federal Chancellery has

<p>remained the same since 1995), and believe the scattered project-based approach to the 
support given to minority cultural activities is unhelpful.52 
</p>
<p><b>  Media 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Austrian Broadcasting Corporation (ORF) is mandated to broadcast 
commensurate proportions of radio and television programmes in national minority 
languages. ORF has established a medium wave radio service in languages of the 
recognized national minorities, airing programmes in Croat, Hungarian and Czech. 
However, the service has a restricted outreach due to the low quality of the broadcasting 
and the unpopular time slots allocated for these. For the Roma minority, access to media in 
their own language is exceedingly limited. 
</p>
<p>64. Members of national minorities expressed concern about the insufficient airtime, 
inadequate staff representation of minority groups within ORF, difficulties in obtaining 
private radio broadcasting licences and in cooperating with ORF to develop programmes in 
minority languages, and the limited airtime for programmes in the minority languages 
(mostly one hour per week). They are equally concerned about the substantial reduction in 
the federal funds allocated to national minorities&#8223; print media.53 
</p>
<p><b>  Other minorities  
</b></p>
<p>65. Polish families, settled in Austria since the beginning of the 17th century, are not a 
recognized national minority. Today, most Austrian Poles live in Vienna. In 2011, 59,753 
persons of Polish origin, i.e. Polish nationals or Austrian nationals who were born in 
Poland, lived in Austria. The Polish minority has been seeking recognition for some years 
as a national minority under the Law on Ethnic Groups as interpreted through the 
declaration of Austria on the occasion of the Ratification of the European Framework 
Convention for the Protection of National Minorities.54 In 2001, the Austrian Government 
rejected this request, arguing that the Polish community does not have a long-standing and 
firmly rooted presence in Austria and further that a majority of the Polish community were 
immigrants and not Austrian citizens. In this regard, the Advisory Committee on the 
Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities has stressed that Austria 
should &#8220;pursue a flexible approach with regard to criteria such as the length of established 
</p>
<p>presence of a group of persons belonging to a national minority in the country to be 
recognized as an ethnic group and ensure that the resulting approach takes into account 
existing calls for inclusion of additional groups in the protection of the Framework 
Convention&#8221;.55 The Committee also urged the Austrian authorities to &#8220;engage in a 
constructive dialogue with Polish representatives rather than limiting their consideration of 
the request for recognition to the analysis of statistics which are frequently incomplete and, 
therefore, favour a narrow interpretation.&#8221;56

</p>
<p>66. The Jenische, a nomadic community mostly residing in south-west Germany, 
Switzerland, Austria and parts of France, are also not recognized as a national minority 
despite having lived in Austria for a long period. Information about their total population 
number is unknown. Throughout her mission, the Independent Expert found it very difficult 
to collect information about their presence in the country, with some official authorities 
being unaware of their existence. Due to the lack of information, the Independent Expert 
cannot draw conclusions on their status and situation in the country. She would like, 
nonetheless, to urge the relevant authorities to undertake studies to determine the number 
and situation of the Jenische community living in Austria, and to adopt necessary measures 
to ensure that their human rights, including the right to enjoy their own culture, to access 
that of others and to participate in and contribute to the cultural life of Austria are 
adequately secured.  
</p>
<p><b> C. The right to profess and practise one's own religion  
</b></p>
<p>67. Thirteen religious communities are legally recognized in Austria: Roman Catholic, 
Lutheran, Greek Orthodox, Eastern Orthodox, Jewish, Muslim, Mormon, Jehovah&#8223;s 
Witnesses, Old Catholic, Armenian Apostolic, Buddhist, New Apostolic, and Methodist.57 
The largest religious community is that of Roman Catholics, followed by Lutherans and 
Muslims. The Austrian legal framework guarantees freedom of religion and belief, as well 
as the right of religious communities to receive religious instruction in public schools and 
for their institutions to act as public entities. It is very difficult for unrecognized religious 
groups and communities to have their institutions recognized as public entities. 
</p>
<p>68. The Government of Austria supports and promotes interfaith dialogue. Interesting 
initiatives in this regard include: the establishment of a Task Force on Dialogue of Cultures 
in 2007; a network of Jewish, Christian and Muslim theologians; the training of Imams;58 
&#8220;Forum.islam&#8221;, a platform for dialogue with Muslims in Austria; and a number of 
conferences and workshops around religious and cultural dialogue involving religious 
leaders and persons seen to be potential &#8220;multipliers&#8221; of key messages. It should be noted 
that interfaith initiatives are mostly intended to promote dialogue among religious leaders. 
By and large these initiatives do not engage the religious communities represented by 
leaders. Such broader engagement, as some representatives of religious communities 
pointed out, may be the greater need. 
</p>
<p>69. The Independent Expert is concerned at numerous reports of discrimination against 
Muslims in Austria, such as attacks on Muslim cemeteries, insults to Muslim students in 
schools, refusal to hire Muslim women wearing headscarves, and the prohibition of the 
construction of mosques and minarets under the auspices of a ban on &#8220;unusual 
architecture&#8221;. A number of anti-Semitic incidents have also been reported.59  
</p>
<p><b> V. Promotion of cultural diversity 
</b></p>
<p>70. It is encouraging that the Austrian legal and institutional framework recognizes the 
value of cultural diversity. However, government policies do not always approach diversity 
as a resource for building an inclusive, pluralistic and open Austrian society. Cultural

<p>diversity is too frequently addressed through ad hoc programmes and non-institutionalized 
practices. While a number of initiatives are in place, there is no coherent framework 
underpinning these. In some cases, the information concerning the funding of activities is 
also unavailable.  
</p>
<p><b>  Integration 
</b></p>
<p>71. The Independent Expert welcomes the adoption of a national action plan on 
integration addressing areas such as education, language, employment, judiciary, social 
services, and intercultural dialogue. She finds it encouraging that the plan was adopted in 
consultation with experts and civil society. However, she insists that the cultural diversity 
of the country should not be regarded as a problem to be fixed and that integration policies 
should not be narrowly defined from an assimilationist approach. Promoting cultural rights 
and diversity requires that communities have access to their own cultures as well as those of 
others. The protection and promotion of minority cultures should not be 
compartmentalized, resulting in further isolation and ghettoization. Instead, efforts must be 
made to encourage cross-cultural exchanges for a pluralistic society in which everyone can 
contribute equally. 
</p>
<p>72. In this regard, it is of concern that integration affairs (through the newly created 
State Secretariat of Integration) have been placed within the Ministry of the Interior, which 
might suggest that &#8220;integration&#8221; is a matter of law and order rather than an opportunity to 
</p>
<p>benefit from and to enhance the richness of the country&#8223;s diverse cultures and cultural 
</p>
<p>traditions.  
</p>
<p>73. The Independent Expert acknowledges the important role played by the European 
Integration and Refugee Funds in assisting and promoting the integration of third-country 
nationals with residence permits, refugees and asylum seekers. However, she believes that 
the criteria used for project funding should be substantially enhanced and an independent 
approval body established to enhance transparency and to eliminate any possibility of a 
conflict of interest between the institution administering the disbursement of funds and the 
recipients of such funding, as suggested by those interviewed.  
</p>
<p><b>  Security forces and public administration 
</b></p>
<p>74. The security forces and other public officials play an essential role in ensuring 
respect for and the protection of human rights of all persons living in Austria. Current 
efforts to fight intolerance, racism and xenophobia among public officials include the 
welcome introduction of human rights training for security forces and the judiciary. 
Nonetheless, there are reports of discrimination in the criminal justice system and of 
excessive use of police force against members of minorities or migrants, particularly of 
Roma or African origin.60 
</p>
<p>75. Furthermore, the fact that few public federal officials, including personnel in prisons 
and detention centres, speak languages other than German hinders adequate implementation 
of the rights of the non-German speaking sectors of the population, in particular people 
with a migrant background.  
</p>
<p>76. The Independent Expert commends the authorities concerned for actively 
encouraging persons with migrant backgrounds to join the police in Vienna. The 
recruitment campaign &#8220;Vienna needs you&#8221; aimed at diversifying the police force and 
</p>
<p>increasing the percentage of police officers in Vienna with an immigrant background is a 
positive example. The Independent Expert urges the Government to undertake similar

</p>
<p>initiatives across the country. Additionally, to ensure genuine equal opportunities for 
persons from a migrant background, German language courses provided by public 
institutions should complement existing language examinations.  
</p>
<p><b>  Education 
</b></p>
<p>77. The Independent Expert welcomes the initiatives adopted by the Government to 
promote intercultural understanding in schools, such as the &#8220;Interkulturelles Zentrum&#8221; 
</p>
<p>brochure and the &#8220;Multilingualism and Interculturality - an Opportunity&#8221; campaign, aimed 
at providing educational material with teaching examples for intercultural learning, 
communication and conflict solution. 
</p>
<p>78. The Austrian education system is complex and fragmented into streams, however. 
Specialized streams of education can impede the full inclusion of some minorities, migrants 
or students with disabilities in mainstream cultural life. After kindergarten, pupils are in 
general sent either to an &#8220;ordinary&#8221; primary school or to a special school (&#8220;Sonderschule&#8221;, 
mostly for those with learning disabilities). After primary school and depending on grades, 
they are sent either to a general secondary school (four years) or to an academic secondary 
school (eight years), which after successful completion allows for enrolment at a university 
or for other tertiary studies. After general secondary school or the first four years at an 
academic secondary school, students can continue their education at either the higher level 
of an academic secondary school (four years); or a medium-level vocational school 
(generally three to four years); or a higher-level vocational school (five years), the 
successful completion of which also qualifies students for tertiary education; or a 
vocational training school, which also allows access to university studies, if the student opts 
for and passes the final examination.61  
</p>
<p>79. According to some of those interviewed, this bifurcation in schooling first following 
kindergarten and then following primary school indirectly segregates students on the basis 
of social attributes. Dividing up students at an early age into two school types leads to a 
fundamental lack of equal opportunities in basic as well as higher education and impedes 
integration amongst students from different ethnic, national and religious backgrounds.62  
</p>
<p>80. The Turkish migrant community is a case in point. Migration from Turkey to 
Austria on a significant scale started in the early 1960s, in response to market demands for 
foreign manpower. After 1973, migration continued mostly in the context of family 
reunification. Today, about 183,000 persons of Turkish origin, i.e. Turkish nationals and 
persons with Austrian citizenship born in Turkey, live in Austria.  The majority live in 
Vienna (73,200), followed by Lower Austria (25,200) and Upper Austria (22,900).63 
</p>
<p>81. Members of the Turkish community face structural obstacles that hamper their 
personal development from an early age. This is particularly the case after primary school 
when immigrant children with a weaker command of German are most often separated and 
educated in &#8220;special schools&#8221; for children with learning difficulties, although this is 
</p>
<p>contrary to legal provisions. Sixty-eight per cent of Turkish migrants have not completed 
school beyond the compulsory level, and they tend to perform less well in school than their 
German-speaking counterparts and bilingual students belonging to other linguistic 
communities. With an unemployment rate of approximately 14 per cent, Turkish

</b></p>
<p>immigrants are twice as likely to be unemployed as Austrians, and the community has the 
highest proportion of individuals at risk of poverty (more than 12 per cent).64 
</p>
<p>82. The Independent Expert received information about the insufficient inclusion of 
migrants in schools and their ghettoization, as well as about the lack of opportunities for 
linguistic minorities, including those with hearing impairments, to acquire education in 
their own languages, thereby affecting their academic performance and future development. 
</p>
<p>83. A positive development in this regard is the 
&#8220;new middle school&#8221; concept introduced as a pilot project in 2008. This establishes 
</p>
<p>&#8220;integrated schools&#8221; where children are educated together from the age of 10 to 14. After 
</p>
<p>that, they can decide, like all other students after their first eight years of schooling, 
whether to move on to upper secondary education or start vocational training. The new 
middle school concept also aims at integrating disabled pupils.65   
</p>
<p>84. A separate concern conveyed to the Independent Expert is that the history of Austria 
as a multi-ethnic State is not sufficiently included in school history textbooks, which also 
do not adequately integrate the history and culture of national minorities.66 This hinders the 
ability of students to learn about the autochthonous practices and traditions of national 
minorities and impedes the inclusion of cultural diversity in the mainstream cultural life of 
Austria from an early age. The Independent Expert is concerned that history textbooks 
covering the Holocaust do not include information regarding the deportation of national 
minorities and the genocide of Roma people during the Nazi regime, virtually erasing their 
tragic experience from the annals of Austrian history. Guaranteeing cultural rights for all 
and promoting cultural diversity entails making visible the histories and contributions of all 
cultural communities to both the general population as well as the communities concerned. 
</p>
<p><b>  Media 
</b></p>
<p>85. Measures adopted by Austria to combat racism and stereotyping in the media 
include the incorporation of provisions prohibiting racial incitement in the Federal Act for 
Austrian Broadcasting. Nevertheless, interlocutors denounced numerous instances of 
discrimination and stereotyping in the media, including mention of the ethnic origin of 
alleged perpetrators of crimes from immigrant or minority backgrounds (particularly 
African or Roma), mainstream media references to &#8220;problems with foreigners&#8221; or the 
&#8220;threat of Islamization&#8221;.  This type of media behaviour reinforces stigmatization and 
intolerance, and contributes to the creation of an atmosphere of hostility and rejection 
towards minorities and non-citizens in Austria.67 The independent press council appears to 
be inactive in addressing the issue of hate speech and discrimination in the media. 
</p>
<p>86. The Independent Expert is disturbed by some reported instances of hate speech by 
politicians, targeting members of minorities, migrants, asylum-seekers, refugees and 
persons of African origin.

</b></p>
<p><b>variety of measures for the protection and promotion of cultural rights of recognized 
</b></p>
<p><b>national minorities. </b> 
</p>
<p>88.<b> The Independent Expert appreciates in particular legislation, in some regions, 
guaranteeing the rights of recognized minorities to bilingual schooling and bilingual 
</b></p>
<p><b>topographical signs, as well as the use of minority languages in judicial and 
</b></p>
<p><b>administrative procedures.  She also commends the codification of a written Romani

</b></p>
<p>89.<b> The Independent Expert further welcomes Government initiatives, such as the 
introduction in some public media broadcasts of subtitles and sign language, as well as 
</b></p>
<p><b>transmissions of broadcasts in official minority languages.  
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> The Independent Expert believes, however, that further steps are needed. 
Measures to promote cultural diversity and cultural rights in Austria remain 
</b></p>
<p><b>compartmentalized and lack an institutional framework that would facilitate building 
</b></p>
<p><b>upon valuable experience. Partly due to this, the implementation of the rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons belonging to minorities and disadvantaged groups in the fields of education, 
</b></p>
<p><b>culture and language as well as their rights not be discriminated against and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>participate in the life of society, remains insufficient.   
</b></p>
<p>91.<b> The Independent Expert recommends that consideration be given to 
establishing a unified framework and an institutional body, at the level of the Federal 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government, to promote cultural diversity and intercultural understanding, to 
</b></p>
<p><b>oversee all cultural heritage matters and to promote the right of all to participate 
</b></p>
<p><b>equally in and contribute to cultural life in Austria. 
</b></p>
<p>92.<b> The Independent Expert observes with concern a tendency amongst some 
policy-</b>makers and implementers to treat Austria&#8217;s rich multi<b>-ethnic, multilinguistic, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and multi-religious composition as a problem needing to be resolved. While Austria 
</b></p>
<p><b>recognizes the value of cultural diversity, government policies do not yet approach the 
</b></p>
<p>country&#8217;s rich diversity as an invaluable resource from which all of Austria<b>n society 
</b></p>
<p><b>could, and indeed should, benefit. Policies should aim at mainstreaming the cultural 
</b></p>
<p>diversity and heritage of the country&#8217;s<b> diverse populations, rather than simply at 
</b></p>
<p><b>assigning rights to particular people and groups in a parallel fashion.  
</b></p>
<p>93.<b> The Independent Expert emphasizes the fact that ensuring </b>people&#8217;s <b>cultural 
rights is about empowering individuals and communities to create culture as 
</b></p>
<p><b>continuously evolving ways of life, each cultural community being equally valued. 
</b></p>
<p>94.<b> The Independent Expert recommends that the Government consider 
addressing the issue of integration together with cultural diversity, either within a new 
</b></p>
<p><b>entity delinked from the Ministry of the Interior or including this subject within the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Federal Chancellery. 
</b></p>
<p>95.<b> The Independent Expert encourages the Government to strengthen efforts to 
incorporate minority cultures and histories in all public schooling curricula, media 
</b></p>
<p><b>and cultural activities; to promote intercultural competencies in all official 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions, and encourage competencies in minority languages, including Austrian 
</b></p>
<p><b>sign language, amongst teachers and civil servants. Special efforts are required to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure the cultural rights of the Roma people, including their full access, contribution 
</b></p>
<p><b>and participation in cultural life. 
</b></p>
<p>96.<b> The Independent Expert stresses that only recognized autochthonous minorities 
are granted particular rights which, however, they lose outside the specifically </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/26/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>designated territories. It is important to note that a strict application of the criteria of 
</b></p>
<p><b>territoriality, notably with respect to rights in the field of education, could undermine 
</b></p>
<p><b>efforts to safeguard the languages and identities of minorities, especially considering 
</b></p>
<p><b>that nowadays, for a number of reasons, members of minorities may opt to settle in 
</b></p>
<p><b>regions other than those they traditionally inhabit. Following previous 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations by regional and international human rights bodies, the Independent 
</b></p>
<p><b>Expert urges the Government to be more flexible in its approach, to consider 
</b></p>
<p><b>extending support to linguistic and ethnic groups other than those officially 
</b></p>
<p><b>recognized in Austria and to improve the existing mechanisms for the disbursement of 
</b></p>
<p><b>funds for activities of national minorities. 
</b></p>
<p>97.<b> The Independent Expert is concerned about the data-collection system used for 
the 2011 census, which excluded information on national, linguistic and religious 
</b></p>
<p><b>affiliation, contrary to previous censuses. The Independent Expert encourages the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government to adopt a non-mandatory and anonymous information-gathering system 
</b></p>
<p><b>with a view to enabling/creating a database on cultural diversity in Austria, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>data on linguistic and religious diversity as well as internal and international 
</b></p>
<p><b>migration. Such a system should guarantee privacy and be respectful of the principle 
</b></p>
<p><b>of self-identification of all persons regarding their national, linguistic and religious 
</b></p>
<p><b>affiliations. Where necessary, the Government should initiate dialogues with 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities to strengthen trust and understanding of the purpose of such a survey. 
</b></p>
<p><b>To that end, the Independent Expert also recommends that the Government consult 
</b></p>
<p><b>with, in particular, civil society organizations and the communities concerned with 
</b></p>
<p><b>regard to the specific formulation of questions to be asked during the census. 
</b></p>
<p>98.<b> The Independent Expert is concerned that the schooling system, which divides 
education after kindergarten and after primary school into separate parallel streams 
</b></p>
<p><b>has an indirect discriminatory effect on children according to their background. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Negatively impacting children with disabilities and a migrant background, the system 
</b></p>
<p><b>impedes opportunities for cross-cultural interaction which are essential for 
</b></p>
<p><b>intercultural understanding and building pluralistic societies. The Independent 
</b></p>
<p><b>Expert welcomes the creation of new middle schools and recommends the adoption of 
</b></p>
<p><b>an integrated system for all compulsory education in public schools.  
</b></p>
<p>99.<b> The Government should take all necessary measures to ensure full respect for 
human rights and cultural diversity by all public officials and security forces, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including by expanding its initiatives to include training on human rights and cultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>diversity in the mandatory curricula of public officials across the country.  
</b></p>
<p>100.<b> Measures are needed to encourage public and private media to avoid 
stigmatizing certain communities. Intercultural exchanges among diverse groups 
</b></p>
<p><b>would help to overcome ghettoization according to attributes such as language, 
</b></p>
<p><b>religion, ethnic background and any kind of disability.  
</b></p>
<p>101.<b> The Independent Expert welcomes the existing initiatives to promote interfaith 
dialogue. However, more than religious authorities engaging with each other, the need 
</b></p>
<p><b>is to provide also opportunities for communities to share experiences and engage with 
</b></p>
<p><b>each other. 
</b></p>
<p>102.<b> The Austrian Constitution is in the process of being reformed. The Independent 
Expert encourages the Austrian Constitutional Assembly to adopt a coherent and 
</b></p>
<p><b>comprehensive catalogue of human rights, including economic, social and cultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights, as well as the rights of the child.  
</b></p>
<p>103.<b> The Independent Expert recommends that the Government, as a matter of 
priority, adopt an integrated national human rights plan of action and a human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>institution in conformity with the Paris Principles, mandated to oversee all rights, </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/26/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p><b>including those in the field of culture, paying special attention to the needs of more 
</b></p>
<p><b>marginalized groups such as persons with disabilities, the economically insecure and 
</b></p>
<p><b>cultural communities outside the mainstream. 
</b></p>
<p>104.<b> The Independent Expert recommends that the Ombudspersons for Equal 
treatment be granted competence to initiate and participate in court proceedings and 
</b></p>
<p><b>given the necessary human and financial resources to conduct their activities.

<p><b>Council of Europe Framework Convention on the Value of Cultural Heritage for

<p>106.<b> Lastly, the Independent Expert strongly recommends that the Government of
