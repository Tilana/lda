</p>
<p> &#8220;<i>Drawing attention</i> to the issue of the impact of terrorist acts on the victims of 
</p>

</p>
<p> &#8220;<i>Concerned</i> with the human rights of persons deprived of liberty in the context of 
counter-terrorism measures,

guarantees to which they are entitled to under international law, including, inter alia, 
protection against torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 
protection against refoulement, the review of their detention and, if subjected to trial, 
fundamental judicial guarantees.&#8221;
