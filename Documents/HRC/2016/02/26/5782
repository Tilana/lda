<p><b>10/... Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment: 
the role and responsibility of medical and other health personnel 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>all resolutions on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment and on forensic science adopted by the General Assembly, the Commission on 
Human Rights and the Human Rights Council, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*  Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Recalling also</i> the Principles of Medical Ethics relevant to the Role of Health Personnel, 
particularly Physicians, in the Protection of Prisoners and Detainees against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that no one shall be subjected to torture or to other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that freedom from torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment is a non-derogable right that must be protected under all circumstances, including in 
times of international or internal armed conflict or disturbance and state of emergency, and that 
the absolute prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment is affirmed in relevant international instruments, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>the duty of medical and other health personnel to practice for the good of the 
patients and never do harm or injustice pursuant to the Hippocratic Oath and their respective 
professional codes of ethics, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that it is a gross contravention of medical ethics, for medical and other health 
personnel to engage, actively or passively, in acts which constitute participation in, complicity 
</p>
<p>in, incitement to or attempts to commit torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment pursuant to the Principles of Medical Ethics, </p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> that medical and other health personnel have a duty to provide competent 
medical service in full professional and moral independence, with compassion and respect for 
human dignity, and to always bear in mind human life and to act in the patient&#8217;s best interest 
under their respective professional codes of ethics, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting</i> the duty of all medical and other health personnel to report or denounce acts of 
torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of which they are aware to relevant medical, 
judicial, national or international authorities as appropriate under and consistent with their 
respective professional codes of ethics,  </p>
<p><i> Noting also</i> that, under the Geneva Conventions of 1949, torture and inhuman treatment 
are a grave breach and that under the statute of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of 
Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the </p>

 <p></p>
<p>Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991, the statute of the International Criminal Tribunal 
for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious Violations of 
International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens 
Responsible for Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of 
Neighbouring States between 1 January and 31 December 1994 and the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court, acts of torture can constitute crimes against humanity and, when 
committed in a situation of armed conflict, constitute war crimes, 
</p>
<p> 1<i>. Condemns</i> all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any time 
and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States to 
implement fully the absolute prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Emphasizes</i> that States must take persistent, determined and effective measures to 
prevent and combat torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and 
stresses that all acts of torture must be made offences under domestic criminal law;  </p>
<p> 3. <i>Stresses </i>that an order or instruction from a superior officer or a public authority 
should not be invoked as a justification of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment and that States must never request or require anyone, including any medical or 
other health personnel, to commit any act of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment; 
</p>
<p> 4<i>. Urges</i> States to respect the professional and moral independence, duties and 
responsibilities of medical and other health personnel; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Also urges</i> States to ensure that all medical and other health personnel may fulfil 
their duty to report or denounce acts of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of which 
they are aware to relevant medical, judicial, national or international authorities as appropriate 
under and consistent with their respective codes of ethics without fear of retribution or 
harassment; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 6. <i>Stresses</i> that all allegations of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment must be examined promptly and impartially by the competent domestic 
authority, including where relevant through examination by forensic experts and other relevant 
medical personnel, in order for those who encourage, order, tolerate or perpetrate such acts to be 
held responsible, brought to justice and punished commensurate with the severity of the offence;  
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Urges </i>States to establish effective investigation and documentation procedures, and 
takes note of the Principles on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment as a useful tool in this respect;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Stresses </i>that States must not punish or otherwise intimidate medical and other health 
personnel for not obeying orders or instructions to commit, facilitate or conceal acts amounting 
to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or for speaking out 
against it;  
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Urges</i> all States to provide all persons deprived of their liberty, in prisons or any 
other detention facility, with a professional medical examination at their admission to and 
transfer between such facilities and thereafter on a regular basis as a means to help prevent 
torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Also urges</i> all States to provide all persons deprived of their liberty with protection of 
their physical and mental health, treatment of any disease or care specifically needed by persons 
with disabilities of the same quality and standard as is afforded to persons not deprived of their 
liberty as a means to help prevent torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment; 
</p>
<p> 11<i>. Recognizes </i>that forensic investigation can play an important role in combating impunity by providing the evidentiary basis on which prosecutions can successfully be brought 
against persons responsible for violations of human rights and, in times of armed conflict, 
international humanitarian law and encourages further coordination concerning, inter alia, the planning and realization of such investigations, as well as the protection of forensic and related 
experts, between Governments, intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental 
organizations; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 12<i>. Calls upon </i>all States to ensure that education and information regarding the absolute 
prohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment are fully 
included in the training of medical and other health personnel who may be involved in the 
custody, interrogation and treatment of any individual subjected to any form of arrest, detention 
or imprisonment;  </p>
<p> 13. <i>Urges</i> all States that have not yet done so to become parties to the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment as a matter of 
priority and calls upon States parties to give early consideration to signing and ratifying the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention; 
</p>
<p> 14.<i> Welcomes </i>the designation or establishment of independent national preventive 
mechanisms to prevent torture, with the participation of relevant medical and other health 
personnel, encourages all States that have not yet done so to establish such mechanisms and calls 
upon States parties to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment to fulfil their obligation to designate or 
establish truly independent and effective national preventive mechanisms; 
</p>
<p> 15.<i>  Requests </i>the Special Rapporteur on torture and other relevant special procedures and 
invites relevant treaty bodies, within their respective mandates: </p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To remain vigilant with regard to medical and other health personnel&#8217;s active or 
passive participation in torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
and to their functional independence of the institution in which they serve; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To discuss possible areas of cooperation with the relevant United Nations bodies, 
specialized agencies and programmes, in particular the World Health Organization, to address 
the role and responsibility of medical and other health personnel in the documentation and 
prevention of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To respond effectively to credible and reliable information submitted to their 
attention regarding alleged cases of the active or passive participation of medical and other 
health personnel in torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment;  </p>

 <p></p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To consider including in their reports submitted to the Council information on the 
problem of medical and other health personnel&#8217;s participation in torture and other cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment; 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Also requests</i> States to cooperate fully and in good faith with the relevant special 
procedures; 
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Calls upon</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
to continue to provide advisory services to States for the prevention of torture and cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including concerning tools such as the Principles 
on the Effective Investigation and Documentations of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment for the investigation of alleged cases of torture; 
</p>
<p> 18.<i> Takes note </i>of the report of the Special Rapporteur (A/HRC/10/44).
