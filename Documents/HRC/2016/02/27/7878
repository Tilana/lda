<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the issue of discrimination against women in law and in 
practice visited the Republic of Moldova from 20 to 31 May 2012 at the invitation of the 
Government. Two of its five members, the Chairperson-Rapporteur, Kamala 
Chandrakirana, and Eleonora Zieli&#324;ska, participated in the visit. 
</p>
<p>2. In accordance with its mandate as contained in Human Rights Council resolution 
15/23, the objectives of the Working Group were to engage in dialogue with the 
Government of the Republic of Moldova and other stakeholders on the issue of eliminating 
discrimination against women in law and in practice; to identify good practices relating to 
the elimination of laws that discriminate against women or are discriminatory in terms of 
implementation or impact; and to make recommendations on improvement of legislation 
and implementation of the law.  The Working Group examined the issue of discrimination 
against women in political and public life as this is its priority theme for 2012, as well as in 
economic and social life.  It also considered issues relating to the intersection of different 
forms of discrimination faced by specific groups of women.  
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group held extensive consultations in Chisinau, the municipality of 
Balti, and the district of Causeni with Government officials, representatives of the 
legislature and judiciary, the Center for Human Rights of Moldova and one of the 
Ombudspersons of Moldova, civil society organizations, representatives of the media and 
religious institutions, as well as a predominantly Roma community in Nisporeni district.  In 
Gagauzia, it met with a representative of the legislature and a few non-governmental 
organizations, and in Transnistria, with the de facto authorities and non-governmental 
organizations.  It also met with the United Nations country team, regional organizations, 
and representatives of the donor community.  It attended two workshops chaired by the 
Minister of Labour, Social Protection and Family (MLSPF) and the Deputy Speaker of the 
Parliament on the subject of its mandate and key national priorities in this regard.   
</p>
<p>4. The Working Group expresses gratitude to the Government for its cooperation in 
ensuring the success of the visit.  It is also grateful to the United Nations country team, 
including the Office of the United Nations Resident Coordinator and its Human Rights 
Adviser, and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of 
Women, for their assistance prior to and during the visit, and to all who provided support to 
the mission.  It looks forward to continued dialogue with the Government and other 
stakeholders on implementation of the recommendations made in the present report. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Context 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Republic of Moldova has enjoyed independence for two decades. During this 
time it has had to address tensions and war in Gaugazia and Transnistria. The situation in 
Gaugazia was resolved by establishing an autonomous territorial entity, whereas the 
political status of Transnistria is as yet unsolved and peace talks continue in the context of 
the &#8220;Permanent Conference on political issues in the framework of the negotiating process 
</p>
<p>on the Transnistrian settlement&#8221; (the 5+2 format).1  These talks resumed in November 2011 
after a long break.     
</p>
<p>  
 1  Moldova and Transnistria are the parties concerned.  The Organization for Security and Co-operation 
</p>
<p>in Europe (OSCE), Russia and Ukraine act as mediators.  The European Union and the United States 
of America are observers. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/50/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>6. Upon independence, the Republic of Moldova pursued a transition to a market 
economy and a pursuit of democratic goals.  Despite reforms, its economic performance 
was generally weak for most of the first decade until an economic recovery which started in 
2000 and gained ground between 2007 and 2011, when the country achieved an average 
annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 6.4 per cent.2  
</p>
<p>7. Despite economic progress, 21.9 per cent of the population was living below the 
poverty line in 2010, indicating that poverty reduction has not kept pace with economic 
growth in the country.  On the 2011 Human Development Index (HDI), the Republic of 
Moldova ranks 111 out of 187 countries and territories, placing it in the category of 
medium human development.  On the Gender Inequality Index (GII) which reflects 
women&#8217;s disadvantage in reproductive health, empowerment and the labour market, the 
</p>
<p>loss in human development due to sex inequalities was 0.298, which is below the European 
regional average.3  
</p>
<p>8. With the prospect of joining the European Union, there is a new window of 
opportunity for the country to further secure the equal enjoyment of human rights for 
women and men.  This opportunity comes at a time of economic crisis in the region and in 
the midst of a long-standing debate within Moldovan society about its overarching values 
and future direction. 
</p>
<p><b> III. The legal framework and its implementation: improvements 
and challenges 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Republic of Moldova has made significant progress since its independence in 
ratifying international human rights treaties and adopting and revising national legislation 
to ensure compliance with international norms and standards.  It ratified inter alia, the 
International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights in 1993, as well as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women in 1994. In 2006, the Republic of Moldova ratified the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention.  
</p>
<p>10. The Constitution of the Republic of Moldova, adopted in 1994, stipulates in article 4 
that its provisions shall be understood and implemented in accordance with the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and treaties to which the country is party.  In case of discord, 
international law takes precedence.  Article 16 guarantees equality before the law without 
discrimination on a closed list of grounds of race, nationality, ethnic origin, language, 
religion, sex, political choice, personal property or social origin.  Article 43 guarantees 
equitable and satisfactory working terms to all and article 48 stipulates equality between 
women and men in marriage.  According to the de facto authorities of Transnistria,4 the 
Transnistrian &#8220;Constitution&#8221; and legislation contain equality provisions, but there is no 
specific legislation pertaining to gender equality.  The authorities saw no need for such 
specific legislation, referring to the leadership role that women played in the political 
history of Transnistria and their current representation in executive bodies.  
</p>
<p>11. The Republic of Moldova has made regular improvements to its laws and policies 
since 2006, including in the field of women&#8217;s human rights, to ensure conformity with 
international human rights standards.   
</p>

 3  See http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/MDA.html and http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/gii/ 
 4  The Working Group expresses no opinion concerning the legal or political status of Transnistria.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/50/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>12. In 2006, parliament adopted Law N. 5-XVI on Ensuring Equal Opportunities for 
Men and Women, which contains the principle of gender equality, defines discrimination 
on grounds of sex, and establishes an institutional framework for its implementation. The 
Law includes provisions pertaining to, inter alia, discrimination on grounds of pregnancy or 
maternity; sexual harassment; and ensuring equal opportunities between women and men in 
the public domain, and socio-economic spheres (including employment) education and 
health care. However, many stakeholders in Government and civil society described this 
law as merely &#8220;declarative&#8221; as it has no enforcement mechanism, despite being a symbolic 
</p>
<p>achievement for women.   
</p>
<p>13. Law N. 5- XVI did not stipulate procedures for submitting and examining 
complaints of sex and gender-based discrimination.  Notwithstanding, the Working Group 
was informed of two cases of gender-based discrimination brought to court by civil society 
organizations.  Decisions on both cases were still pending during the Working Group&#8217;s 
visit.  The Working Group notes that this negligible number of cases in the courts is 
unrepresentative of reported widespread discrimination faced by women in practice.   
</p>
<p>14. At the time of its visit, the Government was conducting a comprehensive review of 
Law N. 5-XVI.  Amendments under consideration include, for example, definitions of 
victimization, sexism, incitement to sex discrimination and discrimination by association; 
the establishment of Gender Coordinating Councils (made up of Gender Units) tasked with 
drafting, promoting and monitoring policies; review of alleged sex discrimination cases 
within public institutions; establishment of minimum participation quotas of 40 per cent of 
each sex in access to public offices, in representation of governing bodies of political 
parties, and on the list of candidates; and recourse mechanisms for victims seeking remedy 
for discrimination. Some of these proposals have been incorporated into Law No. 121 of 25 
May 2012 on Ensuring Equality. 
</p>
<p>15. In 2008, the Republic of Moldova adopted Law N. 120-XVI, which amended the 
Family Code&#8217;s provisions on the minimum age of marriage, raising it from 16 to 18 years 
</p>
<p>for girls, as recommended by CEDAW in 2006.5  However, marriage of children below the 
age of 18 may be authorized by the authorities &#8220;for well-founded reasons.&#8221;  The Working 
Group found that the language used in relation to these exceptions does not contribute to 
certainty of the law and leaves room for discretion, which in turn could be influenced by 
discriminatory practices.     
</p>
<p>16. In 2008, the Republic of Moldova also adopted Law N. 45-XVI on Preventing and 
Combating Family Violence. This law established the institutional framework for 
responding to violence against women including detailing the responsibilities of the 
authorities involved; provides for the establishment of services to reintegrate victims; 
introduces protection orders to provide immediate relief to victims; and allows for greater 
inclusion of civil society in combating family violence.  Its definitions include a broad 
understanding of family (encompassing marriage-like relationships) and violence 
(including physical, sexual, psychological, spiritual and economic violence).  Despite the 
many innovations introduced by this law, its entry into force and implementation were 
limited due to lack of corresponding provisions in the Criminal Code of 2002 on domestic 
violence, leading to prosecution of these acts under general provisions in the Code on 
infliction of bodily harm or assault, or under administrative law.  To address this gap, Law 
N. 167 of 2010 amended the Code, introducing article 201/1 on domestic violence.   
</p>
<p>17. Article 171 of the Criminal Code defines and sanctions rape and provides for a 
number of aggravating circumstances such as recidivism and age of the victim.  Article 172 
</p>
<p>  
 5  CEDAW/C/MDA/CO/3, para. 33. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/50/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>sanctions &#8220;homosexuality or satisfying sexual needs in perverted forms committed through 
</p>
<p>the physical or mental coercion of the person or by taking advantage of the person&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>incapacity to defend him or herself or to express his/her will shall be punished by 
imprisonment for 3 to 5 years&#8221;.  The Government noted during its universal periodic review 
in the Human Rights Council that homosexuality among consenting adults was no longer 
criminalized;6 however, the rationale for differentiating rape (article 171) and &#8220;homosexual 
rape&#8221; (article 172) remains unclear.  This contributes to exacerbating the bias against 
</p>
<p>homosexuality, particularly of law enforcement agencies and the judicial system.  In 2012, 
new amendments were made to the Criminal Code.  Law N. 73 introduced amendments to 
articles 174, 175 and 175/1, which sanction sexual violence against children.  These 
amendments increased sanctions and added an innovative clause dealing with child 
grooming.  However, the age of children, 16, in these articles remains inconsistent with the 
definition of the child in the Convention on the Rights of the Child.   
</p>
<p>18. Sexual harassment is defined and sanctioned by article 173 of the Criminal Code.  
Although there are no known cases of the application of this provision in practice, some 
experts7 as well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs)8 question whether a criminal 
justice response is the most appropriate way of combating sexual harassment since the 
particular nature of the conduct which amounts to sexual harassment makes it difficult for 
the victim to meet the burden of proof requirements necessary for criminal prosecution.  
They therefore argue that civil or administrative law, which is more likely to accept the 
reverse burden of proof, could provide a more efficient response.  However, in serious 
instances, the deterrent and symbolic significance of criminalization should not be ignored.    
</p>
<p>19. With regard to employment, article 8 of the Labour Code of 2003 prohibits any 
direct or indirect discrimination against the employee on the basis of, inter alia, gender.  
Article 10 also stipulates the obligation of employers to ensure equal pay for equal work, 
and article 128 proscribes, inter alia, gender discrimination in the amount and payment of 
wages.  The Labour Code also includes provisions protecting pregnant and nursing working 
women.  Provisions subsuming the traditional role of women as mothers and subordinates 
were amended in 2010 by Law N. 168, which aimed to enhance equality in the workplace 
and decrease overly protective provisions concerning women, in particular those with 
children.  
</p>
<p>20. The Republic of Moldova adopted Law N. 180-XVI in 2008 on Labour Migration, 
which regulates labour activities by immigrant workers in the country as well as of 
Moldovan citizens temporarily employed abroad.  It also includes provisions regulating the 
issuance and suspension of licences to private employment agencies offering labour 
migration services.  The law is mainly focused on labour rights and contains no specific 
guarantees on women&#8217;s rights, nor is it framed by a comprehensive human rights approach.  
</p>
<p>Regretfully, its article 23 sets restrictions on labour emigration that could potentially have 
discriminatory impacts on women.  According to this article, Moldovan citizens shall be 
restrained from emigrating for work if, inter alia, they &#8220;failed to submit written evidence, 
</p>
<p>issued by the competent body for child protection of their residence, of registration of 
children who will remain in the country.&#8221;  As women are traditionally considered 
</p>
<p>responsible for childcare, the burden is likely to fall disproportionately on women who 
desire to migrate.

</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>21. The Republic of Moldova has a solid legal framework, with crucial weaknesses that 
need to be addressed.  For example, the Law on Ensuring Equality, which extends the 
protection against discrimination on many grounds also other than sex, was adopted by 
parliament during the Working Group&#8217;s visit to the country.  Under preparation since 2007, 
its adoption faced strong opposition to inclusion of a ban on discrimination on grounds of 
gender identity and sexual orientation, often accompanied by homophobic arguments, such 
as that being anti-gay is part of the Moldovan identity.  Such opposition led to four grounds 
of discrimination being deleted from the bill: health status, wealth, social origin and sexual 
orientation.  Sexual orientation was cited as a ground for discrimination only as concerns 
work.  This law also includes a number of exceptions evidently in tension with or possibly 
in direct conflict with international law.  It excludes from its protection families other than 
those based on marriage of a man and woman, adoption in cases of homosexual 
relationships, and issues connected to the right to manifest religion or belief.   
</p>
<p>22. The Working Group was informed that the deletions and change in the name of the 
law resulted from compromise between the Government and conservative forces, in 
particular mobilized by the Orthodox Church, which was heavily involved in the debates 
during the drafting process.  This corresponded to findings in the 2011 report of the Special 
Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief referring to &#8220;a formally privileged position of 
the Orthodox Church, in particular its Moldovan Metropolitan branch,&#8221; and the reality that 
</p>
<p>&#8220;the Church apparently wields enormous political influence.&#8221;9  During its visit, the 
Working Group learnt of the strong influence of the Church on other issues, including in 
relation to freedom of assembly10, the prohibition of sex education in school curricula and 
on attempts to amend the country&#8217;s progressive law on abortion. 
</p>
<p>23. The Law on Ensuring Equality was drafted in response to a key recommendation by 
several international human rights mechanisms and is a primary human rights element in  
the Action Plan on Visa Liberalisation of Moldova with the European Union.  Despite the 
last-minute deletions, this law significantly expands the domestic law content of the ban on 
discrimination.  It further stipulates that discrimination on two or more grounds constitutes 
a &#8220;severe form of discrimination&#8221;.  The law establishes a Council to Prevent and Combat 
</p>
<p>Discrimination and Ensure Equality which is charged with reviewing complaints of 
discrimination and making recommendations.   
</p>
<p>24. Given that Law N. 5-XVI on Ensuring Equal Opportunity for Men and Women 
lacks an enforcement mechanism, the measures of the Law on Ensuring Equality are a 
welcome addition to the Moldovan legal framework on non-discrimination. However, its 
effectiveness is seriously in question particularly as a result of the deletion of sanctioning 
powers from the mandate of the Council to Prevent and Combat Discrimination and Ensure 
Equality.  The Working Group thus finds that this increases the urgency to develop a 
coherent approach to non-discrimination, incorporating sex-based discrimination 
consistently and comprehensively.  In this regard, the draft amendments to Law N. 5-XVI 
under consideration would need to be aligned with the Law on Ensuring Equality and the 
competence of the Council reconsidered in this respect.  In view of the Council&#8217;s broad 
remit to deal with all forms of discrimination, women&#8217;s rights risk being compromised 
unless there is a strategy to prioritize sex-based discrimination and its intersections with 
other grounds of discrimination.     
</p>
<p>25. Also during the Working Group&#8217;s visit, a legislative amendment introduced article 
104/1 in the Criminal Code.  This article provides for chemical castration as a mandatory 
additional sanction in cases of rape and homosexual or perverse sexual acts committed 
</p>
<p>  
 9  A/HRC/19/60/Add.2, paras. 31-32. 
 10  See para. 60. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/50/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>through physical or psychological coercion against children less than 14 years of age.  In 
cases of repeated rape or rape with grave consequences for the victim, chemical castration 
may be applied at the court&#8217;s discretion.  The Working Group is concerned about the 
repressive approach of this legislation as expressed by the very nature of this additional 
sanction and the conditions of its application.  Such sanction has been considered &#8220;invasive, 
irreversible and mutilating&#8221; by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and 
raises the issue of its severity and justifiability in the context of the prohibition of cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The amendment also constitutes a 
regressive measure vis-&#224;-vis patients&#8217; rights to informed consent on any health intervention. 
</p>
<p>26. Further, other risks of regression in legal protection exist.  For example, women 
have had the right to abortion since 1955.  The law permits abortion without restriction as 
to reason up to the 12th week of gestation and for health reasons through the 28th week of 
pregnancy.  These gains have come under attack by groups who advocate for reforming the 
law to restrict women&#8217;s reproductive rights, including a motion for parental (in the case of 
</p>
<p>minors) and spousal consent, conscientious objection for medical providers and counselling 
for women on the negative consequences of abortion.11  Five parliamentarians tabled a 
project to reform this law, which has been withdrawn, for now. 
</p>
<p>27. As regards giving effect to the law, the Working Group noted that many procedural 
aspects adversely impact on women&#8217;s ability to effectively claim their rights and protection.  
For example, the &#8220;Methodological Guidelines Regarding the Investigation of Sexual 
Crimes,&#8221; drawn up in 2008 by the Criminal Investigation Directorate of the General 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office conserves gender bias in the administration of justice.  It lists questions 
to be asked of rape victims in order to determine the facts, including past sexual relations 
and circumstances, and signs of injuries and defence exhibited by the victims.  The 
reasoning is because &#8220;&#8230;teenage girls always physically resist sexual intercourse as they are 
shy and modest &#8230; understanding this particularity, the partner interprets this behaviour as 
</p>
<p>consent to the sexual intercourse and applies force to overcome resistance.&#8221;12  The 
assumption underpinning the Guidelines is that the victim has consented to the sexual act 
unless there is evidence of physical resistance, and in the case of teenage victims, the 
evidence of physical resistance or undue force will not be sufficient to prove the crime.   
</p>
<p>28. Certain police procedures also have negative implications for effective 
implementation of the law.  For example, the way in which the police record crimes is of 
concern as it tends to favour the registration of those cases with a higher probability of 
successful outcomes.  This has implications for how crime detection rates are calculated, 
which is based on the number and outcomes of cases sent to the prosecutor.   
</p>
<p>29. As the Special Rapporteur on violence against women was unable to assess the 
impact of Law N. 45-XVI during her visit to the Republic of Moldova in July 2008 because 
it had just entered into force, the Working Group examined some aspects of its 
implementation and noted that challenges remain. In 2012, there were 1,950 complaints of 
domestic violence and 816 recorded cases as compared to 491 recorded cases in 2011.  
There were 48 applications for protection orders under criminal proceedings in 2012, 
compared to 23 in 2011, representing increases in both complaints and requests for 
protection orders.  While this is encouraging, the Working Group took note of reports that 
the overall number of requests for protection orders is in the hundreds. 
</p>
<p>30. With respect to protection orders, the Working Group learnt that courts reportedly 
rarely issue a protection order within the 24 hours required by Law N. 45-XVI.  At times, 
</p>
<p>  
 11  Population Policy Data Bank, Population Division, DESA, United Nations and the Centre for 
</p>
<p>Reproductive Rights.  
 12  Application 53519/07, <i>I. G.</i> v. <i>Moldova</i>, 1 March 2010.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/50/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>courts have also reportedly refused to issue protection orders because the aggressor did not 
recognize the acts and presented witnesses who made statements in his favour.  There are 
also delays in alerting local police and social workers to the existence of protection orders 
and police delays in notifying the perpetrators, as well as lack of monitoring and 
enforcement in certain cases.  According to women&#8217;s rights advocates, victims of violence 
often find themselves in a hostile court environment compounded by the perpetrators&#8217; 
</p>
<p>presence and the biases exhibited by the authorities.  At the time of the Working Group&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>visit, the police were not authorized to issue short-term protection orders, although 
discussions were ongoing on the need to introduce such measures.  The Working Group 
welcomes the innovative interpretation of the legal provision on protection orders by local 
prosecutors, particularly in Causeni, which has created a safer environment for women 
victims of violence. 
</p>
<p>31. The application of administrative sanctions to perpetrators, usually in the form of a 
fine, has proved not to be a deterrent.  In 2012, there were 2,623 administrative sanctions 
for such violence, and 523 cases were closed by the courts due to amicable settlements.  
This trend may be caused, among others reasons, by families choosing to reconcile in order 
to avoid having to pay the fine from their household budget.   
</p>
<p>32. There are also institutional impediments to effective implementation of the law.  The 
police continue to display deep reluctance to intervene in matters deemed &#8220;private&#8221;.  
Further, coordination between the police and social workers at the local level is weak.  As 
many institutions are tasked with implementing Law N. 45-XVI, many note difficulties in 
identifying who holds the lead responsibility and to whom they should address themselves.  
In contrast to the number of victims of family violence, facilities for assisting victims are 
limited.  Provision of services is complicated by an insufficient number of specialized 
professionals to assist victims of violence, a not fully effective referral system and lack of 
clear rules of cooperation between different agencies, as well as lack of security and police 
protection for these facilities.  The Working Group heard concerns that the admission 
procedures of these centres are often rigid, formalized and complex, therefore leaving many 
victims without assistance, particularly those who have no papers from the police, who 
need only access to the shelter and no other service, who have tuberculosis, or have too 
many children.  Many victims are reluctant to be registered in the public register of 
vulnerable persons, which is a requirement of these centres.  The Working Group is further 
concerned that the requirement to register victims seeking assistance and protection from 
violence by residence status has serious exclusionary affects, particularly for rural and 
Roma women.  
</p>
<p>33. In Transnistria, the law does not contain a definition of domestic violence and there 
are no provisions for protection orders.  However, victims can request administrative and 
criminal penalties leading to arrest in serious cases according to the de facto authorities.  
Further, there are no shelters specifically for victims of domestic violence and trafficking, 
despite a general recognition by the authorities and civil society of the severity of these 
issues.  In most cases, domestic violence victims have no choice but to go to Chisinau for 
assistance.  Advocates for women in Transnistria emphasized the importance of 
international engagements and international organizations in changing perceptions of 
violence against women and promoting a rights-based approach to dealing with the issue.  
They noted that 40 to 50 per cent of women in prison are there for killing their husbands or 
partners due to domestic violence.  These cases are often not treated as self-defence nor are 
mitigating circumstances considered in the sentencing.  They also noted that female 
juvenile offenders in detention centres are placed with adults, contrary to international 
standards.  </p>

</p>
<p><b> IV. Policy and institutional architecture 
</b></p>
<p>34. Pursuant to Law N. 5-XVI, the Government approved a National Programme on 
Ensuring Gender Equality in the Republic of Moldova for 2010-2015 and was in the 
process of updating the Action Plan (2013-2016) for implementation by line ministries and 
other national actors.  The Programme covers employment and labour migration, social 
protection and family, education and health care, human trafficking and violence, 
representation of women in advertising and the media, and gender budgeting.  However, 
there is no concrete allocation of resources, with implementation left to the discretion of 
line departments.  The Action Plan (2010-2012), while a good start, was not costed and did 
not comprehensively cover all areas of concern in the Programme.  Other initiatives such as 
the National Development Strategy (Moldova 2020) lack gender analyses and provisions, 
and sectoral strategies marginally, if at all, cover women&#8217;s rights issues. 
</p>
<p>35. Responding to European Union requirements for the Republic of Moldova to reform 
its administration, the National Decentralisation Strategy was adopted by parliament on 5 
April 2012, after two years of cross-country consultations.  The Strategy is considered 
unique for its rights-based approach and espouses gender equality as a core guiding 
principle.  It aims to achieve inclusion of marginalized and vulnerable groups, and promote 
autonomous and democratic local government, capable of offering equitable, quality, local 
services.  While the Strategy is commendable, it is too early to assess or predict its role in 
advancing equality and human rights.  The budget for its implementation may not be drawn 
up before 2015.  
</p>
<p>36. The Working Group recognizes that the prospect of a decentralized governance 
system provides new opportunities and challenges for equality between men and women.  
Since women&#8217;s participation in political and public life is vibrant at the local level, 
decentralization could mean more access to policy-making by women.  However, local 
politics is also highly susceptible to majoritarian and identity politics as well as to 
conservatism and women will face new challenges if these factors heavily shape the making 
of local policies and regulations.  This creates an urgency to ensure the development of an 
institutional architecture to monitor and advance human rights and non-discrimination that 
effectively spans national to local levels of governance in a coherent and meaningful way.  
So far, no preventive or oversight mechanism has been instituted to ensure that 
decentralization does not have a negative impact on women.   
</p>
<p><b> A. Executive bodies 
</b></p>
<p>37. The Minister of Labour, Social Protection and Family (MLSPF) holds central 
responsibility for overseeing the gender equality and women&#8217;s human rights portfolio in the 
Republic of Moldova, and, according to Decision No. 933 approving the National 
Programme, is responsible for coordinating and monitoring its implementation and 
reporting annually to the Government Committee on Gender Equality (GCGE) on progress.  
Some stakeholders stated that the Ministry&#8217;s reports are a compilation of activities and do 
</p>
<p>not contain assessments on advances in equality and rights and on implementation of the 
laws.  
</p>
<p>38. Law N. 5-XVI stipulated a number of national authorities with responsibility for 
equality between women and women.  Among them is GCGE, which was established in 
2006 and chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister, also with primary responsibility for 
monitoring implementation of the National Programme.  The Working Group was informed 
that, for much of its existence, the Committee was dysfunctional due to frequent changes in 
the Government and priorities; however, some recent improvements have been noted, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/50/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>particularly to strengthen the national machinery to oversee progress on equality and 
women&#8217;s human rights. 
</p>
<p>39. Executive-level bodies are complemented by Gender Councils, which were 
established by the Government in 2010.  These are groups of two to four focal points from 
different departments in each organization.  The Ministries of Defence, Economy, Finance, 
Interior, Justice, and Labour, Social Protection and the Family have convened such 
Councils to date. 
</p>
<p>40. While considering the extent to which these actors effectively address the issues, the 
Working Group was unable to get a sense of how they work in conjunction to catalyse real 
results for women&#8217;s enjoyment of their human rights, despite repeated inquiries.  It was also 
not able to ascertain how they will assume oversight for monitoring respect for equality and 
women&#8217;s rights in decentralization.  Further, the Working Group noted a broad range of 
challenges &#8211; from attitudinal to structural &#8211; which necessitate vigilant monitoring of how 
discrimination and women&#8217;s empowerment issues are pursued in this framework.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Institutions for oversight and recourse 
</b></p>
<p>41. The Centre for Human Rights of Moldova was established in 1997 by Law No. 1349 
on Parliamentary Advocates and comprises three institutions: the four Ombudspersons who 
are &#8220;Parliamentary Advocates&#8221;, the Centre for Human Rights and the National Preventive 
</p>
<p>Mechanism against torture, established pursuant to the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
against Torture.  In 2009, the Centre was accorded a &#8220;B&#8221; status by the International 
Coordinating Committee of National Institutions due to a number of weaknesses.  Amongst 
them was the need for clarification on the role, functions, decision-making and budget 
allocations between the four Parliamentary Advocates and the Centre, and amongst the 
Parliamentary Advocates.  The Centre will be subject to ICC review in 2014.  
</p>
<p>42. The Government informed the Working Group that it is in the final stages of 
amending Law No. 1349.  It aims to replace the four Ombudspersons by a more simplified 
structure, involving one or maximum two Ombudspersons.  A mandate dedicated to 
women&#8217;s rights and combating violence is expected to be created.  The Working Group was 
unable to obtain further information regarding concrete measures to effectively integrate 
women&#8217;s human rights into this new structure.  It is also not clear how the Centre and the 
Council to Prevent and Combat Discrimination will complement each other to advance 
equality and women&#8217;s human rights, and fulfil the requirement of European Union 
Directives on the existence of equality bodies. 
</p>
<p>43. The Working Group met with the Director and other members of the Centre.  It 
noted that although Law N. 5-XVI gave the Ombudsperson responsibility for guaranteeing 
and monitoring equality and dealing with complaints of discrimination, the Centre has been 
unable to effectively carry out these tasks as none of the four Ombudspersons has exclusive 
responsibility for women&#8217;s rights.  This is compounded by a range of structural, resource, 
competence, and attitudinal challenges.  Further, it noted a lack of coordination amongst the 
Ombudspersons and insufficient information sharing between them on the issue of whether 
the Centre had received and responded to complaints from women about violation of their 
rights.  The Group also found that the Director&#8217;s portrayal of the situation of women in the 
Republic of Moldova was incongruous with evident persisting discrimination and 
inequalities faced by women and that certain positions were inconsistent with international 
standards on women&#8217;s rights.  Stakeholders added that women&#8217;s rights are not adequately 
mainstreamed in the work of the different Advocates and expressed the view that the Chief 
Ombudsperson is generally unsupportive of gender equality and the effective protection of 
women&#8217;s human rights. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/50/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>44. Other institutions such as the Coordinating Council for Audio-Visual Media can 
monitor the use of language in the media and receive petitions.  The Council gives public 
warnings and fines and can cease advertising or withhold operating licenses from media 
organizations in violation of the Audio-Visual Media Code.  The Working Group met with 
the Council and heard of its efforts to combat discrimination in the media, including its 
success in having the advertising by Sun Television which denigrated women removed.  
</p>
<p>45. In Transnistria, the Ombudsperson informed the Working Group that no complaints 
of sex-based discrimination or domestic violence had been received, despite the significant 
caseload that NGOs reported handling.   
</p>
<p><b> V. Women in political and public life 
</b></p>
<p>46. Where opportunities exist, women are active participants in political and public life 
and constitute a critical force in advancing women&#8217;s human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> A. </b>Women&#8217;s diverse participation<b> 
</b></p>
<p>47. In the judiciary, there are currently 165 women judges out of a total of 441 (37 per 
cent).  This is a 12 per cent increase since 2008, although no woman holds any of the top 
leadership positions.  In the Prosecutor General&#8217;s office, 252 out of 744 prosecutors are 
women (33 per cent).  In 2012, for the first time, a female police commissioner was 
appointed.  
</p>
<p>48. In parliament, there are 20 women (19.8 per cent) out of a total of 101 
parliamentarians,13 placing the Republic of Moldova at 64 out of 188 countries on a ranking 
of women in parliament, as of 1 January 2012.  The position of Deputy Speaker of the 
Parliament is held by a woman. 
</p>
<p>49. At the top levels of the executive bodies, only one ministerial position was held by a 
woman, out of 18 members of the Cabinet, at the time of the Working Group&#8217;s visit.14  She 
is in charge of MLSPF.  After the visit, another woman was appointed as Minister of 
Education.  At the deputy ministerial level, there are 7 women out of 35.  In Transnistria, 
the three deputies to the de facto prime minister are all women, and key &#8220;ministries&#8221; such 
as finance and foreign affairs are led by women. 
</p>
<p>50. The June 2011 general local elections produced a result of 166 women (18.4 per 
cent) out of a total of 898 elected mayors.  In first-level Municipal Councils, 3,033 women 
(28.5 per cent) out of a total of 10,630 counsellors were elected, and 206 women (18.3 per 
cent) out of a total of 1,120 were elected counsellors at the second level.  Women represent 
27.5 per cent of total counsellors.15  Several stakeholders stated that villages with women 
mayors are often among the best in terms of performance and responsiveness to public 
needs.

</b></p>
<p>51. In election management structures, women make up three quarters of staff of 
constituency commissions and 81 per cent of polling stations staff.  As chairpersons of 
electoral commissions, women constitute 48 per cent of the total.16     
</p>
<p>52. Although most parties are comprised of 54 per cent women, many are not actively 
engaged and, as candidates, they were underrepresented in the 2011 local elections 
although they make up 53 per cent of the electorate.  In the period between 1988 and 2009, 
there was a steady increase in women&#8217;s inclusion in the candidates&#8217; lists of political parties, 
</p>
<p>from 8 per cent to 25 per cent.  The Working Group is concerned that this achievement has 
not been securely sustainable, however, as there was regression to 20 per cent in 2010.17  
Political parties have exceptionally required 30 per cent representation in their charter in 
management bodies and on ballots. 
</p>
<p>53. Women in the Republic of Moldova also participate in political and public life 
through other means, as journalists, NGO activists, public interest lawyers and human 
rights defenders.  Women have taken advantage of the democratization of the media since 
2009 and, today, they make up 60 per cent of journalists in the country.  They are 
considered the majority of reformers in journalism, and several play a leadership role in 
developing investigative journalism in the Republic of Moldova.  They often operate as 
independent journalists, including as bloggers in the internet-based public space.  They are 
not in the top decision-making positions of media institutions.  They work under constant 
political pressure, especially those who expose cases of trafficking, abuse in detention 
centres, and corruption.  
</p>
<p>54. As NGO activists, public interest lawyers and human rights defenders, Moldovan 
women speak out on critical public and political debates, including on the formulation of 
laws and policies and on their implementation.  Some do so as members of the State-
sanctioned National Participatory Council and others independently.  Parliamentarians 
acknowledge the key role of civil society in providing them with data and analytical inputs.  
In June, a bill concerning a draft strategy for civil society development was expected to be 
ready for comments from the Government and debate in plenary. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Obstacles to full and equal participation 
</b></p>
<p>55. The allocation of two ministerial portfolios to women is consistent with entrenched 
attitudes and stereotypes in the Republic of Moldova, clearly evident at the highest levels of 
leadership, which constrain women to traditional roles of having principal responsibility for 
the family and children, and for issues traditionally considered within &#8220;women&#8217;s domain&#8221; 
</p>
<p>such as education, social affairs, and gender.  The MLFSP is also heavily female 
dominated, with 19 of the 25 leadership and directorate posts (76 per cent) allocated to 
women.  In contrast, in other fields, women are less represented, especially at decision-
making levels.  For example, women constitute 144 of the 336 employees (42.9 per cent) of 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at home and abroad, but hold only one ambassadorship 
position, to the Council of Europe.  
</p>
<p>56. The Working Group met with several women who are members of political parties.  
As the Republic of Moldova has a national party-list system, the primary obstacle to the 
advancement of women in Parliament has been unwillingness by all major parties except 
the Party of Communists to place women at electable positions on party lists during

</p>
<p>national elections.  Neither Electoral Code provisions nor the rules governing party 
financing are currently sufficient to overcome these problems.  A female mayor serving her 
fifth term could not get the support of her party for a seat in the Regional Council despite 
her ability to gain the necessary votes.  On the eve of the elections, the party transferred her 
from fourth to fourteenth place in the list, denying her the chance to win the elections.  
Women see themselves at a disadvantage during elections because they generally have less 
money than male candidates and lower wages, and less access to decision-making about 
resource allocation or spending. They also often lack male support.   
</p>
<p>57. All the women in political and public office with whom the Working Group met 
highlighted the &#8220;great price&#8221; they must pay because of the imbalance between their 
</p>
<p>professional and family life.  Without a change in the division of labour between men and 
women in the family and without proper public services to support childcare, women active 
in political and public life must constantly bear a double burden.  Some have expressed 
their deep disappointment at the lack of sufficient support from the Government on this 
matter, while others fear that their career choice has become a disincentive for their 
daughters and other women to pursue a public role. 
</p>
<p>58. Women journalists who initiate and participate in public debates on issues which 
challenge traditional views face attacks and threats to their personal safety.  Women 
lawyers who assist women victims of sexual offences are often accused of &#8220;defending 
</p>
<p>prostitution&#8221;.  A woman journalist who has written on diversity themes was recently 
portrayed on an internet site as a covert Islamist.  Women activists who speak out in 
defense of the human rights of lesbians, gays, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) have items 
such as eggs, bottles and stones thrown at them or their offices.  Outspoken Lesbian, 
Bisexual and Transgender (LBT) women are publicly &#8220;outed&#8221; on internet sites in an attempt 
at public shaming.  These acts have been generally condoned by the authorities and many 
testify to the non-responsiveness of the police during such attacks.18  Some positive 
developments from the Government side have been reported in 2012.  
</p>
<p>59. The Working Group is concerned that LBT women are not able to enjoy the right to 
free assembly and association.  For example, following the ban of &#8220;aggressive propaganda 
of non-traditional sexual orientation&#8221; and the declaration of &#8220;a support zone for the 
Orthodox Church&#8221; by the City Council of B&#259;lti in March 2012, at least four other 
municipalities, two districts, and a village reportedly also issued similar ordinances.  Legal 
proceedings initiated by civil society in Balti were reportedly suspended and the case was 
pending at the time of the visit. In the meantime, following the State Chancellery&#8217;s legal 
proceedings, some of these local decisions have reportedly been repealed.  Further, during 
its visit, the Working Group noted highly discriminatory, often sexist and homophobic, 
remarks by members of the Moldovan leadership in the lead-up to the adoption of the Law 
on Ensuring Equality.19  These statements are viewed as condoning discrimination and 
serve to further polarize society.    
</p>
<p>60. The Working Group is additionally concerned about transgender women who are 
unable to amend identity documents following hormonal therapy or sexual correction 
because of court decisions which are reversed due to Government intervention.  These 
actions deny full enjoyment of human rights.

</b></p>
<p><b> C. Efforts towards affirmative measures 
</b></p>
<p>61. The Government acknowledged that women candidates often lose elections not on 
merit but on perceptions.  Efforts to improve women&#8217;s participation and representation 
continue to be initiated by women parliamentarians.  A bill to reform the Law on Political 
Parties (N. 294 of 21 December 2007) was tabled by the Deputy Speaker of the Parliament.  
If adopted, annual State budget allocations for political parties will be granted according to 
a number of criteria, including that 10 per cent of such funding be distributed to political 
parties that promote women on their candidate lists in parliamentary elections; and 10 per 
cent be distributed to political parties that promote women for the positions of local 
councillors of 2nd level (districts and Chisinau municipality) and mayors, proportionally to 
the number of seats obtained by female candidates.  While commendable, the bill lacks 
unanimous support in parliament.   
</p>
<p>62. The Parliamentary Women&#8217;s Group also proposed amendments to the Electoral 
Code to provide a minimum quota of 30 per cent of women in political party lists in line 
with the Government Program for 2011-2014, without specifying that women would need 
to be placed at electable positions on party lists.  Amendments of this kind are necessary 
because so far this has remained at the discretion of the parties.  In 2011, the Government 
approved the amendments as proposed.  However, the bill has yet to advance since its 
submission to Parliament in 2010. 
</p>
<p>63. These amendments complement Law N. 5-XVI, which includes in its article 7 
provisions for equality in elections and political parties, although women who face 
discrimination in political and public life noted that this Law has not been accessible or 
applicable to their situation.   
</p>
<p><b> VI. Women in the labour force 
</b></p>
<p>64. The capacity of the Republic of Moldova to sustain its economic growth in difficult 
economic times and to effectively address persistent poverty is tied to its capacity to 
eliminate barriers to full and equal participation of Moldovan working women in the labour 
force.  Compared to men, women have higher rates of underemployment and are 
overrepresented in the lowest paying sectors such as education, public administration and 
social assistance, with consequent lower remuneration.  Women earn 72 per cent of men&#8217;s 
wages.  Many workplaces are segregated, with men occupying decision-making and 
managerial positions, and women undertaking lower-paid technical or other work.     
</p>
<p>65. The Working Group was informed that working women also face other 
disadvantages such as overly protective legal provisions on maternity, which create 
difficulties for both employers and employees and cause indirect discrimination as 
employers are reluctant to hire women, especially of reproductive age. A different 
retirement age of 62 years for men and 57 for women is applied.  As a result, when women 
no longer have an income and their husbands die, they are often rendered destitute as 
widows.  For example, in the apparel factories of Gagauzia, where women make up 70 per 
cent of the workers, the age of employment is up to 45 years, after which women are 
obliged to turn to agriculture and the informal sector, where they barely make a living.  
Further, openly discriminatory practices in hiring, including a preference for women under 
the age of 35, as well as incidences of sexual harassment, are common.  
</p>
<p>66. Stakeholders stated that a key institution in monitoring implementation of the 
Labour Code and discrimination in labour practices is the Labour Inspectorate.  However, 
Labour Inspectorate staff lack knowledge on equality and non-discrimination, thereby </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/50/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>impacting on their ability to correctly identify and take action concerning discrimination 
against women in the labour market.  
</p>
<p>67. Labour migration reaches one third of the Moldovan working age population.  A 
recent NBS Labour Force Survey found that 43 per cent of Moldovan migrants are women, 
many of whom are employed as domestic workers.  Notwithstanding, the Working Group 
noted that there are no indications of a comprehensive gender analysis of the situation of 
women migrant workers upon return or prior to departure or any special measures to 
address the vulnerabilities of these women.  For example, young women returning from 
work abroad face a range of negative treatment, including ostracism and heightened risk of 
rape, due to the perception of having undertaken sex work abroad.  In Gagauzia, the 
authorities stated that villages are apprised of women returning from work abroad with 
diseases in an attempt to both protect the community and ensure medical treatment.  This 
raises issues of confidentiality of medical information.  This issue is reportedly not 
confined solely to Gagauzia.  
</p>
<p>68. Further, women migrant workers face stigmatization based on stereotypical views of 
their primary role in child-rearing.  Data shows that approximately 100,000 children have 
been left behind by migrant parents and are being raised by grandparents, relatives or 
neighbours.  In Bilceni Noi village, Singerei district, the Working Group was informed of 
the large numbers of elderly women bearing the burden of childcare.  However, several 
stakeholders stated that the issue of children being left behind has been dramatized to 
discourage women from migrating. 
</p>
<p>69. The Government informed the Working Group that it was working with the 
International Labour Organization (ILO) to sign the Convention on Domestic Workers. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Systemic and multiple discrimination against Romani women 
</b></p>
<p>70. Romani women face discrimination on grounds such as sex and ethnicity, and their 
low socio-economic status.  Romani women and girls in particular have high rates of 
illiteracy, lack access to employment and are particularly vulnerable to violence.  They 
have lower life expectancy compared to non-Romani women and rarely benefit from social 
services, including reproductive health services at the community level.  They are almost 
completely excluded from political life, particularly as candidates and in electoral 
management structures.20  There are few if any Romani women employed in public 
functions at any level above the local level, and they are also completely excluded from 
elected and civil service positions in the local and regional administration.21  Romani 
women who are single mothers, divorced or widowed face difficulties in securing their 
rights to housing and land.  Within their communities, Romani women and girls also face 
discrimination, including prevalent early marriage of girls, which denies them many 
opportunities.  
</p>
<p>71. Romani advocates stated that they have little or no access to women 
parliamentarians and politicians do not respond to their concerns.  Quotas for universities 
have not worked in practice because no adequate support exists at the secondary level of 
education for Romani girls and women.  In its visit to the village of Cioresti and a Romani 
community in Vulcanesti village in Nisporeni district, the Working Group was informed of 
a current high degree of absenteeism of Roma children from schools because of seasonal

<p>migration of the Roma community.  Despite there being 60 per cent women candidates 
running for Council in a commune with the highest percentage of Romani inhabitants in the 
country, none of them were Romani. 
</p>
<p>72. The multiple forms of discrimination faced by Romani women represents a pattern 
of discrimination against the Romani people that is pervasive, persistent and deeply 
entrenched in social behaviour, constituting what the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights identifies as systemic discrimination. 
</p>
<p>73. The Government adopted a Roma Action Plan for 2012-2017 which mentions 
Romani women and makes provisions to establish Roma Community Mediators at the 
community level.  The Working Group noted that Romani advocates enthusiastically 
welcomed such Mediators.  It emphasizes the importance of the full and equal participation 
of Romani women in all stages of implementation and evaluation of the Plan, including as 
Community Mediators.  It also commends the stated intention of the Government to support 
15 Community Mediators from the State budget from 1 January 2013, and urges that the 
estimated 45 communities identified as needing a Mediator be covered by the 2014 budget, 
upon confirmation by the mapping undertaken.  It underlines the critical role of well-trained 
Mediators, particularly to understand and address multiple discrimination faced by Romani 
women.   
</p>
<p>74. The Working Group draws attention to the importance of addressing structural 
impediments to the empowerment of Romani women, including in their access to 
education, employment and property, and guaranteeing Romani women&#8217;s full and equal 
enjoyment of all human rights, including cultural rights.  It also notes that action to 
strengthen networks of Romani women and girls would contribute to ending practices such 
as child marriages and child labour, reportedly prevalent in some Romani communities.  It 
is concerned that the Government has no effective affirmative action measures for Romani, 
including in the labour market or disaggregated data, including by sex, on their 
employment.  The Government&#8217;s effort to increase the quality of medical services, 
including in rural and Romani communities, must address Romani women&#8217;s access to 
health care generally, including reproductive health and rights, and for adolescents.   
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Good practices 
</b></p>
<p>75. Formal and informal alliances and networks among women across party lines have 
been crucial to strengthening women&#8217;s political participation in the Republic of Moldova.  
The vibrancy of the exchanges is commendable and the Working Group considers these 
alliances and networks to be good practices. 
</p>
<p>76. Women parliamentarians have initiated cross-party alliances in order to build 
support for common agendas, particularly on eliminating discrimination against women and 
advancing women&#8217;s human rights.  The creation of quotas for women in political parties is 
one of the results.  The cross-party lines of communication continue to be open and 
productive, despite the lack of approval for a formal women&#8217;s caucus in Parliament.  
</p>
<p>77. Women parliamentarians also advocate together for support of their party leadership 
and form alliances with men to advance women&#8217;s rights as a public agenda.  They develop 
</p>
<p>close cooperation with women leaders of political parties in other countries, and take part in 
events organized by international and bi-lateral organizations to promote parity in politics, 
share women&#8217;s experiences in politics and enhance their capacities, including in negotiating 
</p>
<p>skills.  Political party youth groups play an important role in forming future women 
politicians. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/50/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>78. Initiatives such as the Women&#8217;s Political Club &#8211; 50/50 by local civil society groups 
in collaboration with international organizations have been instrumental in developing the 
skills of women politicians and their visibility.  The Congress of Local Authorities from 
Moldova (CALM) works to develop the capacities of local women leaders to perform job-
related competencies, with support from UN Women.  On 10 December 2011, a Women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Network of CALM was established and has inspired greater activism of women leaders at 
local level.  
</p>
<p>79. Other complementary initiatives, including United Nations and bilateral 
development agencies support for women&#8217;s political participation, deserve mention.  For 
example, since April 2010, the United Nations and the Government have been organizing a 
series of high-level meetings entitled Women Leaders Dialogue Series to facilitate 
dialogue, learning and networking among Moldovan women leaders and their international 
partners.  As a result, a programme for supporting women in leadership in the Republic of 
Moldova and their increased participation in politics is under development by UN Women.  
Bilateral donors are funding initiatives such as Women&#8217;s Political Empowerment, which 
includes support for the establishment of a Women&#8217;s Caucus in Parliament, and the 
LeaderSHE - Young Women Leaders Academy, which grants awards to the 100 best 
women leaders.  
</p>
<p>80. Women Ambassadors to the Republic of Moldova are taking a leadership role in 
supporting women&#8217;s political participation with other international development partners, 
and maintain continuing dialogue with parliament and women parliamentarians as well as 
women mayors through CALM. 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>After two decades of legal reforms, the Republic of Moldova has built the 
foundation for guaranteeing equality and non-discrimination based on sex and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>grounds.  Nevertheless, the law still contains provisions which impede full equality 
</b></p>
<p>and women&#8217;s human rights as well as <b>serious exceptions which hinder full protection.  
</b></p>
<p><b>This needs to be resolved and implementation vigilantly monitored.  Diversity and 
</b></p>
<p><b>inclusion of all groups and views in society is still lacking.  The highly charged, 
</b></p>
<p><b>politicized debates preceding adoption of the Law on Ensuring Equality demonstrates 
</b></p>
<p><b>how the development of a coherent and consistent legal framework on non-
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination is inextricably linked to ongoing public debate in the Republic of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Moldova </b>about its values and future direction.  Women&#8217;s activ<b>e participation in this 
</b></p>
<p><b>debate, including marginalized and vulnerable groups, and its consequent impact on 
</b></p>
<p><b>law-making, is critical.   
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>Despite the persistent barriers arising from conservatism and patriarchal 
attitudes and gender stereotyping, Moldovan women have played a leadership role in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the advancement of equality, non-discrimination and human rights.  They do so as 
</b></p>
<p><b>parliamentarians, mayors, journalists and human rights defenders, inter alia.  Their 
</b></p>
<p><b>leadership can be sustained by ensuring effective protection and recourse 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms, which would also enable them to enjoy their own rights, including in 
</b></p>
<p><b>political and public life.  Women who are perceived to challenge traditional roles and 
</b></p>
<p><b>values, power structures and the status quo are in particular need of greater State 
</b></p>
<p><b>support and encouragement.  Currently however, the institutional architecture for 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights without discrimination is not adequately equipped to respond to women </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/50/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>and their rights.  It may also be difficult to sustain an increasing number of women in 
</b></p>
<p><b>public office without adequate support for improved work-life balance. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The resilience of the Republic of Moldova in a time of economic crisis depends 
on the full and equal participation of women in the labour market and the capacity to 
</b></p>
<p>address obstacles to women&#8217;s right to decent work.  This is <b>also a critical time to 
</b></p>
<p><b>secure and support the contributions of women who have so far been marginalized, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including rural women, elderly women, women migrant workers, and Roma women. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>International engagement and exchanges have been important in increasing 
awareness of human rights and their enjoyment in the Republic of Moldova, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>through collaborations involving women leaders and organizations on issues such as 
</b></p>
<p><b>domestic violence, political participation and community development. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Republic of Moldova must use all tools at its disposal to enhance equality 
</b>and women&#8217;s human rights.  Data collection, analyses, disaggregation and <b>the use 
</b></p>
<p><b>thereof to inform policy choices and objective policymaking is in need of 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthening.  Awareness-raising and education are critical, as is using media and 
</b></p>
<p><b>civil society to promote equality and non-discrimination.  Above all, a legal, policy and 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutional framework that protects and promotes the human rights of women is a 
</b></p>
<p><b>sine qua non.   
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The Working Group wishes to make the following recommendations to 
improve equality and non-discrimination and greater protection and promotion of 
</b></p>
<p>women&#8217;s human rights<b> in the Republic of Moldova.

</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Ensure allocation of resources to facilitate implementation of the 
</b></p>

<p><b>in relation to the National Decentralisation Strategy.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Improve effective implementation of the law on family violence by: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Reviewing delays in issuance of protection orders and ensure their 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective implementation, including by approving the draft guidelines on 
</b></p>
<p><b>integration of the police, medical and social services while approaching victims 
</b></p>
<p><b>of domestic violence; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Adopting measures to empower the police to issue short-term protective 
</b></p>
<p><b>orders; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Strengthening State legal aid and pro-bono legal counselling services as 
</b></p>
<p><b>well as psycho-social support for sex-based discrimination, including gender-
</b></p>
<p><b>based violence, and assistance and shelter for victims. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Review the </b>&#8220;<b>Methodological Guidelines Regarding the Investigation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Sexual Crimes</b>&#8221;<b> to ensure conformity with international human rights standards on 
</b></p>
<p><b>sexual violence. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Ensure amendments to the 2006 Law on Ensuring Equal Opportunities 
</b></p>
<p><b>for Men and Women underline the complementary character of this law and the Law 
</b></p>
<p><b>on Ensuring Equality and include an explicit clause stipulating that the Council to 
</b></p>
<p><b>Prevent and Combat Discrimination and Ensure Equality will examine cases of sex 
</b></p>
<p><b>and/or gender based discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Adopt without delay the amendments to the Electoral Code and Law on 
</b></p>
<p><b>Political Parties and other relevant laws and regulations which establish special 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures to move swiftly towards parity in practice of men and women in political 
</b></p>
<p><b>and public life. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Make further revisions in the Criminal Code by modifying relevant 
</b></p>
<p><b>provisions in the Criminal Procedure Code to enforce the protection of victims of 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence against secondary victimization during criminal proceedings. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, the Optional Protocol to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Optional 
</b></p>
<p><b>Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, ILO Convention 
</b></p>
<p><b>No. 189 Concerning Decent Work for Domestic Workers, Protocol 12 to the European 
</b></p>
<p><b>Convention on Human Rights, and the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing 
</b></p>
<p><b>and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Support development of the analytical capacity of parliament on issues 
</b></p>
<p><b>affecting compliance with non-discrimination and equality standards, including sex-
</b></p>
<p><b>based discrimination and its intersections with other grounds of discrimination.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) Incorporate provisions of Security Council resolution 1325 in talks with 
</b></p>
<p><b>Transnistria and ensure the active participation of young women and men on both sides. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The Working Group recommends to independent national institutions: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The Council to Prevent and Combat Discrimination and Ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>Equality should develop jurisprudence and work practices in conformity with 
</b></p>
<p><b>international law, and establish a comprehensive ban on discrimination covering all 
</b></p>
<p><b>grounds under international law, including sexual orientation and gender identity. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) The Centre for Human Rights and its successor should develop a 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanism for the protection of human rights defenders, with immediate priority for </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/50/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender (LBT) defenders and LBT women, and marginalized 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups, in particular Romani women. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) The National Preventive Mechanism under the Optional Protocol to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Convention against Torture should evaluate the situation of women in detention 
</b></p>
<p><b>across the Republic of Moldova, including on domestic violence charges and 
</b></p>
<p><b>convictions, and female juvenile offenders, and aim to establish cooperation for these 
</b></p>
<p><b>purposes in Transnistria. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Measures to strengthen the effective prot</b>ection of women&#8217;s human rights and 
</p>
<p><b>empowerment of women 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Working Group recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Initiate a national campaign to increase public understanding and 
</b></p>
<p><b>support for the elimination of discrimination against women in all fields of life, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including for women migrant workers, minority women, LBT women, and all other 
</b></p>
<p><b>women in positions of vulnerability, and to promote public recognition and acceptance 
</b></p>
<p>of women&#8217;s leadership role in political and public life.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Establish and sustain a process of dialogue with women in political and 
</b></p>
<p><b>public life on ways and means to reconcile work and family life, including by learning 
</b></p>
<p><b>from best practices in other countries, with a view to developing special measures. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Support the establishment and development of independent think tanks 
</b></p>
<p><b>which would improve evidence-based policy discussions and public discourse to 
</b></p>
<p><b>address persistent barriers in equality and non-discrimination, including on 
</b></p>
<p><b>controversial issues such as reproductive health and sexual orientation and gender 
</b></p>
<p><b>identity, as well as to address blind spots in understanding such as on the situation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Romani women, women migrant workers and other women in positions of 
</b></p>
<p><b>vulnerability. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) </b>Encourage employers&#8217; associations and trade unions to take a m<b>ore

</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Initiate cooperation with the de facto authorities of Transnistria and 
</b></p>
<p><b>other relevant stakeholders to afford women in Transnistria greater protection and

<p><b>enjoyment of their human rights, and engage in joint cooperation and programmes to 
</b></p>
<p><b>combat violence against women.   
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Comprehensively address barriers to equality for Romani women by:

<p><b>women, and on structural and cultural barriers to Romani </b>women&#8217;s access to 
</p>
<p><b>and benefit from these policies; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Supporting the development of qualitative research on the challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b>faced by girls, single mothers, young mothers, divorced or widowed women,

</b></p>
<p><b>Romani community to inform policymaking; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Ensuring the capacity of Romani Community Mediators to be gender-
</b></p>
<p><b>responsive and transformative in their work, including enabling Romani 
</b></p>
<p><b>women to negotiate within their communities, and full budgetary provisions to
