<p><b>resolution 
</b></p>
<p><b>  27</b>/&#8230;  <b>Human rights and unilateral coercive measures 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> all previous resolutions on human rights and unilateral coercive 
</p>
<p>measures adopted by the Commission on Human Rights, the Human Rights Council and the 
</p>
<p>General Assembly, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> Human Rights Council resolution 24/14 of 27 September 2013 and 
</p>
<p>General Assembly resolution 68/162 of 18 December 2013, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> that unilateral coercive measures and legislation are contrary to 
</p>
<p>international law, international humanitarian law, the Charter and the norms and principles 
</p>
<p>governing peaceful relations among States, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated character of 
</p>
<p>all human rights and, in this regard, reaffirming the right to development as a universal and 
</p>
<p>inalienable right and an integral part of all human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing</i> <i>its concern</i> at the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on 
</p>
<p>human rights, development, international relations, trade, investment and cooperation, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>that no State may use or encourage the use of any type of measure, 
</p>
<p>including but not limited to economic or political measures, to coerce another State in order 
</p>
<p>to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from 
</p>
<p>it advantages of any kind, </p>
<p>  
 * Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><i>Recognizing</i> that unilateral coercive measures in the form of economic sanctions can 
</p>
<p>have far-reaching implications for the human rights of the general population of targeted 
</p>
<p>States, disproportionately affecting the poor and the most vulnerable classes, 
</p>
<p><i>Underlining</i> that under no circumstances should people be deprived of their basic 
</p>
<p>means of survival, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>that long-term unilateral coercive measures may result in social 
</p>
<p>problems and raise humanitarian concerns in the States targeted, 
</p>
<p><i>Highlighting</i> the deep-rooted problems and grievances within the international 
</p>
<p>system and the importance for the United Nations to give a voice to all members of the 
</p>
<p>international community in order to ensure multilateralism, mutual respect and the peaceful 
</p>
<p>settlement of disputes, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the final document of the sixteenth Conference of Heads of State or 
</p>
<p>Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Tehran from 26 to 31 August 20121 and the 
</p>
<p>final document of the seventeenth Ministerial Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement, 
</p>
<p>held in Algiers on 28 and 29 May 2014, and those adopted at previous summits and  
</p>
<p>conferences, in which States members of the Movement decided to refrain from 
</p>
<p>recognizing, adopting or implementing extraterritorial or unilateral coercive measures or 
</p>
<p>laws, including unilateral economic sanctions, other intimidating measures and arbitrary 
</p>
<p>travel restrictions, that seek to exert pressure on non-aligned countries &#8211; threatening their 
</p>
<p>sovereignty and independence, and their freedom of trade and investment &#8211; and to prevent 
</p>
<p>them from exercising their right to decide, by their own free will, their own political, 
</p>
<p>economic and social systems, where such measures or laws constitute flagrant violations of 
</p>
<p>the Charter, international law, the multilateral trading system as well as the norms and 
</p>
<p>principles governing friendly relations among States, and, in this regard, oppose and 
</p>
<p>condemn these measures or laws and their continued application, persevere with efforts to 
</p>
<p>effectively reverse them and urge other States to do likewise, as called for by the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly and other United Nations organs, and request States applying these measures or 
</p>
<p>laws to revoke them fully and immediately, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> that the World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna from 14 
</p>
<p>to 25 June 1993, called upon States to refrain from any unilateral measure not in 
</p>
<p>accordance with international law and the Charter and that created obstacles to trade 
</p>
<p>relations among States and impeded the full realization of all human rights, and that also 
</p>
<p>severely threatened the freedom of trade, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply</i> <i>concerned</i> that, despite the resolutions adopted on this issue by the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly, the Human Rights Council, the Commission on Human Rights and at United 
</p>
<p>Nations conferences held in the 1990s and at their five-year reviews, and contrary to norms 
</p>
<p>of international law and the Charter, unilateral coercive measures continue to be 
</p>
<p>promulgated, implemented and enforced by, inter alia, resorting to war and militarism, with 
</p>
<p>all their negative implications for the social-humanitarian activities and economic and 
</p>
<p>social development of developing countries, including their extraterritorial effects, thereby 
</p>
<p>creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and 
</p>
<p>individuals under the jurisdiction of other States, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply disturbed also </i>by the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the 
</p>
<p>right to life, the rights to health and medical care, the right to freedom from hunger and the 
</p>
<p>right to an adequate standard of living, food, education, work and housing,  
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p><i>Alarmed</i> by the disproportionate and indiscriminate human costs of unilateral 
</p>
<p>sanctions and their negative effects on the civilian population, in particular women and 
</p>
<p>children, of targeted States,  </p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that unilateral coercive measures are a major obstacle to the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development, 
</p>
<p><i>Concerned</i> that unilateral coercive measures have, in some instances, prevented 
</p>
<p>humanitarian organizations from making financial transfers to States where they work,  
</p>
<p><i>Underlining </i>the necessity of examining the wide range of impacts of unilateral 
</p>
<p>coercive measures on international humanitarian and human rights law, as well as on the 
</p>
<p>economy, peace, security and social fabric of States, </p>
<p><i>Highlighting </i>the need to monitor human rights violations associated with unilateral 
</p>
<p>coercive measures and to promote accountability,  </p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> the necessity of establishing a special procedure, within the context of 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights Council, on the impact of the application of unilateral coercive measures 
</p>
<p>on the enjoyment of all human rights,  </p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1, on the institution-building of the 
</p>
<p>Council, and 5/2, on the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate Holders of the 
</p>
<p>Council, of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his/her 
</p>
<p>duties in accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> article 1, paragraph 2, common to the International Covenant on Civil 
</p>
<p>and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
</p>
<p>Rights, which provides that, inter alia, in no case may a people be deprived of its own 
</p>
<p>means of subsistence, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to stop adopting, maintaining or implementing unilateral 
</p>
<p>coercive measures not in accordance with international law, international humanitarian law, 
</p>
<p>the Charter of the United Nations and the norms and principles governing peaceful relations 
</p>
<p>among States, in particular those of a coercive nature with extraterritorial effects, which 
</p>
<p>create obstacles to trade relations among States, thus impeding the full realization of the 
</p>
<p>rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human 
</p>
<p>rights instruments, in particular the right of individuals and peoples to development; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Strongly objects</i> to the extraterritorial nature of those measures which, in 
</p>
<p>addition, threaten the sovereignty of States and, in this context, calls upon all Member 
</p>
<p>States neither to recognize these measures nor to apply them, and to take effective 
</p>
<p>administrative or legislative measures, as appropriate, to counteract the extraterritorial 
</p>
<p>application or effects of unilateral coercive measures; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Condemns</i> the continued unilateral application and enforcement by certain 
</p>
<p>powers of such measures as tools of political or economic pressure against any country, 
</p>
<p>particularly against developing countries, with a view to preventing these countries from 
</p>
<p>exercising their right to decide, of their own free will, their own political, economic and 
</p>
<p>social systems; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Expresses</i> <i>grave concern</i> that, in some countries, the situation of children and 
</p>
<p>women is adversely affected by unilateral coercive measures not in accordance with 
</p>
<p>international law and the Charter that create obstacles to trade relations among States, 
</p>
<p>impede the full realization of social and economic development and hinder the well-being 
</p>
<p>of the population in the affected countries, with particular consequences for women, 
</p>
<p>children, including adolescents, the elderly and persons with disabilities, </p>


<p>5. <i>Reiterates</i> <i>its call</i> upon Member States that have initiated such measures to 
</p>
<p>abide by the principles of international law, the Charter, the declarations of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations and world conferences and relevant resolutions, and to commit themselves to their 
</p>
<p>obligations and responsibilities arising from relevant provision of the international law and 
</p>
<p>human rights instruments to which they are parties by putting an immediate end to such 
</p>
<p>measures; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Reaffirms</i> in this context the right of all peoples to self-determination, by 
</p>
<p>virtue of which they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their own 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural development; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Also reaffirms</i> its opposition to any attempt aimed at the partial or total 
</p>
<p>disruption of the national unity and territorial integrity of a State, which is incompatible 
</p>
<p>with the Charter; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Recalls</i> that, according to the Declaration on Principles of International Law 
</p>
<p>concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the 
</p>
<p>Charter of the United Nations, and to the relevant principles and provisions contained in the 
</p>
<p>Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, proclaimed by the General Assembly in 
</p>
<p>its resolution 3281 (XXIX) of 12 December 1974, in particular article 32 thereof, no State 
</p>
<p>may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measure to coerce 
</p>
<p>another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign 
</p>
<p>rights and to secure from its advantages of any kind; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Reaffirms</i> that essential goods, such as food and medicines, should not be 
</p>
<p>used as tools for political coercion and that under no circumstances should people be 
</p>
<p>deprived of their own means of subsistence and development; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Underlines</i> the fact that unilateral coercive measures are one of the major 
</p>
<p>obstacles to the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development and, in this 
</p>
<p>regard, calls upon all States to avoid the unilateral imposition of economic coercive 
</p>
<p>measures and the extraterritorial application of domestic laws that run counter to the 
</p>
<p>principles of free trade and hamper the development of developing countries; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Rejects</i> all attempts to introduce unilateral coercive measures, as well as the 
</p>
<p>increasing trend in this direction, including through the enactment of laws with 
</p>
<p>extraterritorial application, which are not in conformity with international law; 
</p>
<p>12.  <i>Recognizes</i> that the Declaration of Principles, adopted at the first phase of the 
</p>
<p>World Summit on the Information Society, held in Geneva in December 2003, strongly 
</p>
<p>urges States to avoid and refrain from any unilateral measure in building the information 
</p>
<p>society; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Urges</i> all special rapporteurs and existing thematic mechanisms of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council in the field of economic, social and cultural rights to pay due 
</p>
<p>attention, within the scope of their respective mandates, to the negative impact and 
</p>
<p>consequences of unilateral coercive measures; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Recognizes </i>the importance of the quantitative and qualitative documentation 
</p>
<p>of the negative impacts associated with the application of unilateral coercive measures in 
</p>
<p>the context of ensuring the accountability of those responsible for the human rights 
</p>
<p>violations resulting from the application of unilateral coercive measures against any State; 
</p>
<p>15. <i>Decides</i> to give due consideration to the negative impact of unilateral 
</p>
<p>coercive measures on the human rights issues in its task concerning the implementation of 
</p>
<p>the right to development; </p>


<p>16. <i>Requests</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in 
</p>
<p>discharging his functions in relation to the promotion and protection of human rights, to pay 
</p>
<p>due attention and give urgent consideration to the present resolution; 
</p>
<p>17. <i>Notes</i> <i>with appreciation</i> the holding of the workshop on the impact of the 
</p>
<p>application of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights by the 
</p>
<p>affected populations, in particular their socioeconomic impact on women and children, in 
</p>
<p>the States targeted organized by the Office of the High Commissioner, on 23 May 2014, in 
</p>
<p>Geneva;  
</p>
<p>18. <i>Takes note</i> <i>with appreciation</i> of the report of the Office of the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner on the proceedings of the above-mentioned workshop,<footnote name="2">A/HRC/27/32. 
</footnote> and takes positive 
</p>
<p>note of the report of the Secretary-General submitted to the General Assembly on human 
</p>
<p>rights and unilateral coercive measures;<footnote name="3">A/68/211. </footnote> 
</p>
<p>19. <i>Decides</i> to organize an annual human rights mainstreaming panel discussion 
</p>
<p>on the issue of unilateral coercive measures and human rights, with the participation of 
</p>
<p>Member States, relevant United Nations bodies, agencies and other relevant stakeholders, 
</p>
<p>and also requests the Office of High Commissioner to prepare and submit a report on the 
</p>
<p>panel discussion to the Human Right Council;
