<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, Manfred Nowak, and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
and consequences, Yakin Ert&#252;rk, undertook a joint visit to the Republic of Moldova, including 
the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova, from 4 to 11 July 2008.  
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur expresses his appreciation to the Government for its excellent 
cooperation. He notes the Government&#8217;s commitment to uphold and promote human rights and, 
hence, the progress made since independence in 1991. He also warmly welcomes the initiatives 
under way to prevent torture, in particular the creation of a national preventive mechanism under 
the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p> On the basis of discussions with public officials, judges, lawyers and representatives of 
civil society, interviews with victims of violence and with persons deprived of their liberty, often 
supported by forensic medical evidence, the Special Rapporteur concludes that ill-treatment 
during the initial period of police custody is widespread. He also received serious allegations of 
torture in some police stations. A number of cases of ill-treatment were reported to the Special 
Rapporteur in institutions under the Ministry of Justice, mainly in terms of inter-prisoner 
violence. While recently some torture cases have reached the courts, the Special Rapporteur 
found that, overall, most complaints mechanisms are ineffective. 
</p>
<p> Conditions in police cells do not conform to international standards and are not suited to 
holding people for long periods. Detention in such conditions for up to several months, as 
practised in the Republic of Moldova, amounts to inhuman treatment. The conditions of 
detention in institutions under the Ministry of Justice vary. Some institutions, in particular the 
pretrial facility in Chi&#351;in&#259;u, were severely overcrowded. Others located outside the capital had 
an acceptable amount of space for each prisoner. However, the Special Rapporteur was 
concerned about the standard use of quarantine cells for newly arrived detainees, most of which 
were not in line with international standards. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur received 
numerous complaints about the restricted access to medical care and the poor quality of food. 
</p>
<p> With regard to the State&#8217;s legal framework, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that 
torture has been criminalized and that safeguards are, by and large, provided for by the 
legislation. In order for the safeguards to be effective, however, the various players in the 
criminal law cycle must live up to their responsibilities and denounce cases of torture. 
</p>
<p> In the light of the above, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government of the 
Republic of Moldova implement fully its obligations under international human rights law. In 
particular, he urges the Government to equip the recently created national preventive mechanism 
with the necessary human and other resources and to view it as an aid in the collective effort to 
discover what really happens in places where persons are deprived of their liberty. He also 
recommends that the penitentiary system be conceived in a way that truly aims at the 
rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders. Accessible and confidential complaints 
mechanisms, effective and independent criminal investigation and prosecution mechanisms 
against alleged perpetrators of torture should be established. Other recommended steps include 
reducing the time limits for police custody to 48 hours, strengthening safeguards to make them </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/44/Add.3 
  page 3 
 
</p>
<p>effective, and transferring temporary detention isolators from the Ministry of the Interior to the 
Ministry of Justice. The prosecution should be required to prove beyond reasonable doubt that no 
unlawful means have been used to obtain evidence, rather than leave the burden of proof on the 
victim. 
</p>
<p> With regard to the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova, the Special 
Rapporteur was particularly concerned about the lack of a complaint and monitoring mechanism. 
He therefore recommends the activities of the national preventive mechanism be extended to the 
Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova. Furthermore, torture should be criminalized 
and the death penalty abolished <i>de jure</i>. Additionally, the practice of solitary confinement for 
persons sentenced to death or to life imprisonment should be stopped immediately. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur calls upon the international community to assist the Government 
of the Republic of Moldova in its fight against torture by providing financial and technical 
support. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment of the Human Rights Council, Manfred Nowak, undertook a visit to Moldova from 
4 to 11 July 2008, at the invitation of the Government. The visit was undertaken jointly with the 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, Yakin Ert&#252;rk, 
which allowed both mandates to benefit from each other&#8217;s experience in assessing the situation 
of human rights in Moldova and underlined once again the importance of a gender-sensitive 
interpretation of torture. 
</p>
<p>2. The purpose of the visit was: to assess the situation of torture and ill-treatment in the 
country including conditions of detention, and to offer assistance to the Government in its efforts 
to improve the administration of justice. The Special Rapporteur notes that Moldova has made 
considerable progress in institution-building and protecting human rights. He encourages the 
Government to implement the recommendations contained in this report with a view to fully 
complying with international minimum standards in the administration of justice. 
</p><p>3. The two Special Rapporteurs held meetings with the Prime Minister; the Deputy Prime 
Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and European Integration; the Minister of Health; the 
Minister of Justice; the Minister of Interior; the Minister of Social Protection, Family and Child; 
the Prosecutor General and the Deputy Minister of Economy and Trade. In addition, the Special 
Rapporteurs met with Members of Parliament, the Head of the Penitentiary Administration; 
representatives of the Ministry of Education and Youth, representatives of the Governmental 
Committee for Gender Equality and the Bureau for Interethnic Relations, members of the 
Supreme Court of Justice and governmental institutions at local level. The Special Rapporteur 
wishes to thank the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and all the other authorities for their excellent 
cooperation. He is particularly grateful that, at the outset of his visit, they provided him with 
letters authorizing him to access all places of detention without prior announcement and to 
interview detainees in private. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteurs also met with representatives of the National Preventive 
Mechanism (NPM) under the Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention against 
Torture, including its Chairman, Mr Ivan Cucu, who was at the same time one of the heads of the 
Centre for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteurs also had discussions with civil society representatives, including 
non-governmental organizations, ethnic minorities, religious leaders, persons in places of 
detention and victims of violence, trafficking and ill-treatment and their relatives. In addition, 
they held meetings with the United Nations country team, the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Delegation of the European Commission, other members of </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/44/Add.3 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>the diplomatic community and the donors group (on gender). The Special Rapporteurs visited 
prisons, police posts, a psychiatric hospital and several shelters in different parts of the country<b>1</b> 
(see also appendix). 
</p>
<p>6. The delegation also visited the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova, met with 
the so-called Acting Foreign Minister and the so-called Deputy Head of the Penitentiary 
Administration of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova and visited some 
detention facilities.<b>2</b> In 1990, the Transnistrian region has unilaterally declared independence 
from Moldova. The Transnistrian region was however not recognized as independent State. In 
line with the European Court of Human Rights in its Ila&#351;cu decision of 2004,<b>3</b> the Special 
Rapporteur considers that the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova comes under the 
jurisdiction of both, the Republic of Moldova and the Russian Federation and that, therefore, 
both of them share the responsibility to uphold respect for human rights. He accepts, however, 
the argument of the Government that the authorities of the Republic of Moldova do not exercise 
de facto control over that territory. The present report refers to the findings concerning the

</p>
<p>Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in paragraphs at the end of the respective 
chapters. Since the Special Rapporteur had only one day to visit the Transnistrian region of the 
Republic of Moldova, his assessment is necessarily less complete. He would like to express 
special thanks to the OSCE presence in Moldova for its support during the visit to the 
Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova. 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur further expresses his gratitude to the Office of the Resident 
Coordinator and the Head of the presence of the High Commissioner for Refugees in Moldova. 
He would also like to thank the entire United Nations team for the excellent assistance prior to 
and throughout the mission, including human rights officers, interpreters and drivers; 
Dr. Duarte Nuno Vieira, forensic expert; and Ms. Isabelle Tschan and Ms. Julia Kozma of the 
Ludwig Boltzmann Institute of Human Rights in Vienna. 
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur shared his preliminary findings with the Government at the close 
of his mission. On 4 December 2008, a preliminary version of this report was sent to the 
Government. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the extensive and constructive comments 
sent to him on 19 January 2008, which he has incorporated in the present report and its appendix 
to the extent possible. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  International level 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Republic of Moldova is a party to the major United Nations human rights treaties 
prohibiting torture and ill-treatment: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR) and its first and second Optional Protocols;<b>4</b> the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment and Punishment (CAT); the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child; and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women. Moldova has ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture 
(OPCAT). It is a party to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and to Additional Protocols I and II 
thereof, but not to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Regional level 
</b></p>
<p>10. Relevant regional human rights instruments ratified by Moldova, a member State of the 
Council of Europe, include the European Convention on Human Rights and its Protocols, 
inter alia Protocols No. 6 and 13 abolishing the death penalty and the Convention on Action 
against the Trafficking of Human Beings. It has also ratified the European Convention for the 
Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, under which the 
Committee on the Prevention of Torture has undertaken several visits to Moldova.<b>5</b>

</p>
<p>11. The European Court of Human Rights has found violations of Article 3 of the European 
Convention on Human Rights - the prohibition of torture and of inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment - in fifteen judgements handed down since 2005. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  National level 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Constitution of the Republic of Moldova 
</b></p>
<p>12. Article 24 (2) of the Constitution prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment. In its Chapter II, the Constitution also contains a variety of relevant provisions 
relating to fundamental rights and freedoms, notably the right to life, physical and mental 
integrity. Its Article 4 (1) also stipulates that human rights and freedoms guaranteed in the 
Constitution shall be understood and implemented according to the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights as well as conventions and treaties ratified by Moldova. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Prohibition of torture in national legislation 
</b></p>
<p>13. In its general principles, the Criminal Code of Moldova stipulates that &#8220;[t]he Criminal Law 
does not have as a purpose to cause physical suffering or to violate human dignity. No person 
can be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman, degrading treatments or punishments 
(article 4 (2)). Following recommendations by the Committee against Torture in May 2005, on 
30 June 2005, by Law No. 139, the Moldovan Parliament introduced new Article 309 (1) into the 
Criminal Code, making torture punishable by two to five years&#8217; imprisonment and suspension 
from official duties for five years. The definition of torture is in line with Article 1 CAT.<b>6</b> Some 
other provisions can equally be applied to acts of ill-treatment by officials, notably articles 309, 
308 and, most often exceeding powers or official duties (article 328). Like for any other crime 
sanctioned with a maximal punishment of five years&#8217; imprisonment (&#8220;less severe crime&#8221;), a 
statute of limitation of five years is applicable to the crime of torture. 
</p>
<p>14. The prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment, respectively punishment, 
is enshrined in article 10 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CCP), article 16 (a) of the Code 
of Ethics of the Police and article 166 (1) (b) of the Enforcement Code.<b>7</b> Furthermore, article 11 
of CCP prohibits physical and mental abuse of and threats against detainees and provides for the 
respect of their human dignity. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  Article 309 (1) Criminal Code: [torture is an] &#8220;action by which severe physical or mental pain 
</p>
<p>and suffering is deliberately caused to a person, especially with the aim of receiving information 
or a confession from the person concerned or a third person, punishing him or her for a deed that 
the person concerned or a third person committed or is suspected of having committed, 
intimidating or putting pressure on the person concerned or a third person, or for any other 
reason based on a form of discrimination, whatever it is, if such pain or suffering is caused by an 
official or by any other person that acts officially or at the instigation or with the verbal or 
written consent of such a person, except for the pain or suffering that results exclusively from 
legal sanctions, inherent to such sanctions or caused by them&#8221;.

</p>
<p><b>3.  Safeguards, complaints and investigations of torture allegations 
</b></p>
<p>15. The domestic legislation provides for a serious of safeguards with regard to arrest and 
detention, such as the right of a detainee to be informed of his/her right to legal defense (CCP 
article 64 (1)), the right of a detainee to inform his/her family of the place of detention within six 
hours after arrest,<b>8</b> the right to confidential meetings with his/her defense lawyer (articles 64 (6) 
and 66 (6)) and the right to be heard in presence of his/her defense lawyer (articles 64 (7) and 
66 (7)). 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Length of police detention 
</b></p>
<p>16. Article 25 (3) of the Constitution and Articles 63 (2) (i); 165 (1); 166 (4) CCP provide for a 
period of custody of 72 hours, after which the person is to be brought before a judge. (CCP 
article 66 (4)). This period can be prolonged by 6 to 12 months depending on the crime of which 
a person is accused (CCP article 186 (3)). Police detention of minors can be prolonged by 
30 days up to 4 months. Prolongation of police detention is decided by the investigating judge 
upon request of the prosecutor. Detention may be legally challenged at a hierarchically superior 
court. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  National Human Rights Action Plan 2004-2008  
and National Development Strategy 2008-2011 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the measures taken according to the National Human 
Rights Action Plan 2004-2008,<b>9</b> e.g., in relation to the improvement of conditions of detention 
for female detainees as well as improved conditions and treatment for detainees suffering from 
tuberculosis and other diseases. He encourages the Government to quickly implement other 
planned steps, such as providing for a mandatory independent medical examination of persons 
taken into custody and the transfer of the management of preventive detention facilities from the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs (MoI) to the Ministry of Justice (MoJ). 
</p>
<p>18. The National Development Strategy for 2008-2011 sets out several steps to be taken in the 
area of penal law reform, particularly the creation of measures alternative to detention and the 
focus on social rehabilitation for convicted detainees.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Transnistrian region 
</b></p>
<p>19. As regards obligations at the international and regional levels, by Resolution 226 of the 
so-called &#8220;Supreme Council&#8221; of the &#8220;Transnistrian Republic&#8221; of 22 September 1992, the 
Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova undertook &#8220;independently of the membership 
of the Transnistrian Republic in the respective international organizations, to consider the 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>8
</b>  Articles 64 (12) and 173 (1) CCP; see also Code of Ethics of Police (CEP) Article 21.

</b>  Law on the approval of the National Development Strategy for 2008-2011, No. 295-XVI,

</p>
<p>mentioned international acts [Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of 
Genocide, ICCPR, European Convention on Human Rights, ICESCR] as in force in the territory 
of the Transnistrian Republic&#8221; (point 2 of res. 226). 
</p>
<p>20. Article 21 of the so-called Transnistrian &#8220;Constitution&#8221; provides that no one can be 
&#8220;subjected to torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and punishment,&#8221; Whereas the 
&#8220;Criminal Code&#8221; of 19 April 2006 does not contain the definition of torture required by the 
Convention against Torture, it criminalizes &#8220;istyazanie&#8221; (torment), to be punished with up to 
3 years of imprisonment (article 114) and states that it can be combined with &#8220;torture&#8221;, to be 
punished with up to 7 years of imprisonment. Articles 3 (1) and 57 of the &#8220;Criminal Procedure 
Code&#8221; contain a series of guarantees, namely on non-admissibility of the proofs obtained through 
violations of the Code the presumption of innocence (article 4) and fair trial (articles 6, 11 
and 43). Its Article 6 (1) on &#8220;Respect for the honour and dignity of the person&#8221; provides 
explicitly that &#8220;In a criminal process acts and decisions humiliating the honour of the party, as 
well as any treatment humiliating his human dignity or creating danger for his life and health are 
prohibited. None of the parties to a criminal process must be subjected to violence, torture, other 
cruel or degrading treatment.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>21. Although abolitionist in practice, the death penalty is still provided for by the &#8220;legislation&#8221; 
of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova. 
</p>
<p>22. A &#8220;Human Rights Commissioner&#8221; has been instituted, but he does not undertake 
monitoring visits to places of detention and most of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors 
expressed distrust in this institution. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  ASSESSMENT OF THE SITUATION 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Acts of torture and ill-treatment in places of detention 
</b></p>
<p><b>Institutions under the Ministry of Justice 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur has received a limited number of allegations of ill-treatment by 
officials in institutions under the authority of the MoJ.<b>11</b> However, although corporal punishment 
of children is unlawful under the general provisions prohibiting torture and the Law on Child 
Rights,<b>12</b> he received credible allegations about corporal punishment and forced labour in 
Lipcani educational colony reportedly to prepare minors for life in adult prisons. 
</p>
<p>24. In Rezina, several detainees in the tuberculosis unit informed the Rapporteur that, 
on 4 July 2008, in response to their complaints about fish they had been served that they found 
rotten, they were beaten by the guards. The Special Rapporteur assessed these allegations and 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>11
</b>  The Government repudiated these allegations of ill-treatment and stressed that rights and 
</p>
<p>obligations of the convicted minors would be respected. The Special Rapporteur welcomes 
on-going efforts by the Government, e.g. in the area of training for penitentiary staff on the 
prevention of torture.  
<b>12
</b></p>
<p>  Articles 4, 6, 7, 18, 29.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/44/Add.3 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>found that they were partly corroborated by medical evidence. He also took due note of 
information provided by the colony&#8217;s administration that guards had been injured by the 
detainees in the above described process. He concluded that it is likely that the violence used by 
the guards was excessive. He urges the authorities to conduct a proper investigation into the 
allegations.<b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur has learned that a strictly hierarchical order among prisoners has 
been inherited from Soviet times. Those who do not want to obey the so-called &#8220;law of the 
criminal world&#8221; are subjected to threats and violence by their co-prisoners. As a result, a certain 
level of violence, including sexual violence among prisoners is widely alleged to be quite 
common (e.g. vis-&#224;-vis the so called &#8220;humiliated ones&#8221;, who are used for sexual services to 
prisoners higher up in the hierarchy). Whereas, according to information provided by the 
authorities, a number of preventive and educational measures have been taken to neutralize this 
hierarchy and ensure equal treatment of all detainees,<b>14</b> the Special Rapporteur has received 
credible allegations that in many cases, the prison administration supports and sustains this 
system as a way of managing discipline. The Special Rapporteur would like to recall that 
inter-prisoner violence can amount to torture or ill-treatment if the State fails to act with due 
diligence to prevent it. 
</p>
<p><b>Police custody 
</b></p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur received consistent and credible allegations of frequent beatings 
and other forms of ill-treatment and torture at some police detention facilities, mostly during 
interrogation, but also during arrest. This was the case in particular in Comrat and surrounding 
police stations and district police stations in Chi&#351;in&#259;u. He also visited police stations, where he 
received no allegations of violence, e.g. Cimislia. In light of the information received in private 
interviews with individuals who were or had been in police custody, the corroborating results of 
independent forensic medical examinations of injuries, he concludes that ill-treatment during the 
initial period of police custody is widespread. 
</p>
<p>27. Torture methods such as severe beatings, with fists, rubber truncheons, and baseball bats, 
including on soles, electro-shocks, asphyxiation through gas masks, putting needles under 
fingernails and suspension are used in order to extract confessions from suspects. In general 
these acts are performed when suspects refuse to &#8220;cooperate&#8221;. The torture and ill-treatment is 
normally inflicted avoiding visible marks (by putting cloth around the wrists when suspending, 
beating on soles, fabric around the baseball bat used for beatings etc.). 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>13
</b>  He wishes to thank the Government for the additional information provided to him regarding 
</p>
<p>this case. He took note of its assertion that the authorities had used &#8220;legal special means - rubber 
batons and handcuffs&#8221; only to defend themselves and that their use was in line with the 
applicable legislation. He regrets, however, that these findings do not appear to have been made 
by an independent investigation body.

<p><b>Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova 
</b></p>
<p>28. With respect to penitentiary institutions the Special Rapporteur found the level of 
inter-prisoner violence to be of concern. As regards treatment during militia custody, the Special 
Rapporteur received consistent and credible allegations of frequent beatings and other forms of 
ill-treatment and torture, mainly during interrogation. Torture methods include severe beatings, 
with fists and rubber truncheons, including on soles and kidneys, electro-shocks, needles inserted 
under their fingernails. 
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur also received information that in the Transnistrian region of the 
Republic of Moldova transfers of prisoners are conducted by the police. Prisoners are packed on 
top of each other in a metal wagon with only one tiny window. In the summer the heat in the 
wagon becomes unbearable after a few minutes but they have to stay inside for hours. Different 
categories of prisoners are mixed during these transports (adults, minors, sick, including those 
with open tuberculosis), which puts the prisoners at risk of contamination with diseases. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Conditions in places of detention 
</b></p>
<p><b>Institutions under the Ministry of Justice 
</b></p>
<p>30. Undoubtedly, progress has been achieved in improving conditions of detention.<b>15</b> 
However, some of the institutions visited by the Special Rapporteur were heavily overcrowded. 
The authorities themselves pointed out that Institution No. 13 in Chi&#351;in&#259;u was severely 
overcrowded - on the day of the visit it held 931 persons with the official capacity being 600 
(see also appendix). The Special Rapporteur was informed of Government plans to close down 
this institution. 
</p>
<p>31. Common problems at all pre- and post-trial prisons are the poor hygienic conditions, 
restricted access to health care and lack of medication as well as risk of contamination with 
tuberculosis and other diseases. Whereas the Special Rapporteur notes that the minimum norms 
regarding nutrition of detainees (Government Decision n. 609 of 29 May 2006) are checked on a 
daily basis and that, according to the financial plan of the Penitentiary Department, the food 
budget for 2008 had almost doubled in comparison to 2004 and is set to rise further, he also 
received consistent allegations regarding the poor quality and quantity of food. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>15
</b>  The Government indicated that a large number of penitentiary institutions have undergone or 
</p>
<p>are currently undergoing renovation, including heating, water supply systems, sanitary facilities 
or roofs (e.g. n. 1 - Taraclia, n. 3 - Leova; n. 5 - Cahul, n. 6 - Soroca, n. 9 - Pruncul, n. 17 - 
Rezina, n. 18 - Branesti; some of these projects are supported by international or bilateral donors.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/44/Add.3 
  page 13 
 
</p>
<p>32. Recognizing some efforts made by the Government to reduce the overcrowding in prisons, 
such as e.g. the application of alternative measures to deprivation of liberty,<b>16</b> the Special 
Rapporteur is concerned by the extensive periods of pretrial detention. Several of his 
interviewees had spent up to three or four years in detention without a final judgement. This 
concern is exacerbated by the fact that the conditions in the pretrial facilities (SIZO) are often 
worse than in facilities for convicted prisoners (detainees are held in overcrowded cells for 
23 hours per day). Spending prolonged periods in such conditions constitutes a violation of the 
principle of the presumption of innocence and, in some cases, may amount to inhuman treatment. 
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur was particularly concerned about the drastic security measures 
against persons convicted of severe crimes or so-called recidivists. Especially the year-long 
confinement to cells for 23 hours per day of persons sentenced to life-imprisonment may amount 
to torture or inhuman treatment. The Special Rapporteur welcomes Government reports about 
studies conducted in 2008 about the psychological state of persons serving a life sentence, on the 
basis of which more flexible security arrangements are to be made in their regard. 
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur found that the so-called &#8220;initial regime&#8221; was introduced in the 
Enforcement Code of the Republic of Moldova in 2005. Instead of &#8220;humanizing&#8221; conditions for 
the detainees, this regime actually exacerbated their situation by confining them to their cells for 
periods between three, six and nine months after the sentence as an &#8220;introduction&#8221; to life in a 
correctional institution, which should aim at rehabilitating convicted persons. 
</p>
<p>35. As confirmed by the authorities, persons arriving in penitentiary institutions, as a general 
rule have to spend 15 days in quarantine in order to undergo a medical examination of their 
overall state of health and their labour capacities The Special Rapporteur found that conditions in 
quarantine cells are generally worse than elsewhere and was concerned about the high risk of 
infection in these cells, since detainees with contagious diseases seemed not always to be 
separated. 
</p>
<p>36. Sicknesses and diseases still occur at a high level in places of detention, although the 
overall trend is positive. As a result of the measures taken by the Penitentiary Administration in 
cooperation with international organizations, according to Government figures, the incidence of 
tuberculosis (TB) in penitentiary institutions was reduced from 495 cases in 2006 to 245 cases 
in 2008 (51% decrease, 153 new cases and 92 relapses), prevalence fell from 1150 cases in 2001 
to 290 at the end of 2008, mortality rates halved in the period 2002 to 2007. Regarding 
HIV/AIDS, the Government reports that, on 1 December 2008, 296 detainees were registered as 
infected with HIV. Out of them, 32 are receiving antiretroviral treatment. With regard to the 
latter, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that access to anti-retroviral therapy appears to be 
limited and reports that effective prevention measures are insufficient. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>16
</b>  Authorities informed him that, in 2007, 1941 and in the first six months of 2008, 1497 pretrial 
</p>
<p>detainees were released due to the introduction of alternative measures of imprisonment.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/44/Add.3 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>37. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur noted with concern that article 248 of the 
Enforcement Code requires that prisoners on hunger strike be separated from other detainees and 
be kept in &#8220;carcers&#8221; in solitary confinement until they give up the hunger strike. These cells, 
mostly located in the basement of the penitentiary institutions, lack natural light and are often 
very small and filthy. Moreover, prisoners who are detained in a &#8220;carcer&#8221; are not allowed to 
receive visits and go for walks outside. 
</p>
<p><b>Police custody 
</b></p>
<p>38. Despite of international and national<b>17</b> minimum standards, conditions in some police 
custody facilities are a source of major concern. Whereas some police stations were suitable at 
maximum for short-term police custody, in some cases, notably in B&#259;l&#355;i, Comrat, and at Chi&#351;in&#259;u 
police headquarters, the conditions amounted to inhuman treatment. In those police stations, 
persons were held in small, badly ventilated cells with little or no daylight sometimes for several 
weeks or even months. However, according to official sources, some of the police custody 
facilities had been closed in order to improve conditions (Criuleni, Ialoveni, Straseni, Cantemir, 
Glodeni, Stefan-Voda, Edinet, Donduseni, Ciadir-Lunga). 
</p>
<p>39. Notwithstanding some measures taken by the Government,<b>18</b> many persons in police 
custody complained about the quality and quantity of the food, although some said that it had 
slightly improved. Detainees in some police stations (e.g. Comrat) indicated that they received 
food only once per day. Lack of access to medical care was another major concern. Some of the 
cells were not equipped with mattresses and persons in police custody were not given blankets to 
sleep on. 
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur received consistent allegations that the minimum time required by 
national law for exercise (one hour per day) is not respected in many cases. At several police 
stations, detainees indicated that they are allowed to walk only for about 15 minutes per day. 
This is exacerbated by the fact that some spend long periods of up to several months in police 
custody.<b>19</b> The one shower per week requirement is not always respected. Moreover, the toilet in 
the cells consists normally of a bucket or an open toilet without flush, at best separated by one 
meter high walls. Since often more than one person is detained in a cell, these sanitary facilities 
deprive the detainees of their privacy. Furthermore, this situation generates not only an 
unpleasant smell, but also a critical hygienic situation. 
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur learned that visits by relatives during police custody have to be 
authorized by the investigator. However, he was told by many of his interlocutors that this is 
hardly ever the case and practically no visits took place, although in many cases the relatives 
regularly bring food and clothes to the facility, but are not allowed to see the detainee. The fact 
that police detainees are prevented from receiving visits for prolonged periods of up to several

</b>  Articles 20 and 21 of the Code on Police Ethics.

</p>
<p>months adds unnecessary hardship on the detainees. In this context, the Special Rapporteur notes 
that, according to the Ministry of Interior, new instructions have been elaborated jointly by the 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, the Ministry of Interior, the Penitentiary Department and others to regulate 
meetings and telephone conversations of detainees. 
</p>
<p><b>Institutions under the Ministry of Health 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Law on psychiatric assistance stipulates that a patient shall be treated in a human 
manner, shall have access to a lawyer or legal representative and that hospitalization in a 
psychiatric establishment is to be limited to the period needed for medical examination and 
treatment and always be subject to informed consent by the concerned patient and that any 
patient has the right to complain to a lawyer, to the public authorities and to the court.<b>20</b> 
However, the Special Rapporteur received allegations that these safeguards were not effective in 
practice - hardly any psychiatric patient had access to a lawyer and the requirement of informed 
consent is frequently not respected. He welcomes information provided by the Ministry of 
Health that the humanization of the system of psychiatric assistance was on-going (with the 
introduction of a focus on out-patient treatment, of a formal procedure for obtaining informed 
consent and of awareness raising activities on patients&#8217; rights). 
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur visited a psychiatric clinic in B&#259;l&#355;i, including the wards for persons 
who were serving court sentences, including forced treatment and the children&#8217;s ward. He was 
concerned that persons serving court sentences were held in apathy, subject to excessive use of 
tranquilizers and by the lack of clarity on whether the use of these tranquilizers was always 
based on free and informed consent by the patients.<b>21</b> Moreover, according to the forensic expert 
who accompanied the Special Rapporteur, the medication given to the partly very young 
children, especially in terms of tranquilizers, was clearly not suitable. He thanks the Government 
for the additional information received and welcomes that the Ministry of Health recognized that 
the treatment, which consists almost exclusively of the use of strong neuroleptics (developed 
long time ago), was inadequate and indicated that psychiatric care would be individualized, new 
treatments developed (ergo therapy, psychotherapy, music therapy, occupational therapy), and 
modern drugs purchased once the necessary funds were made available. 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur received allegations that psychiatric clinics are sometimes used as 
places of detention (see appendix: B&#259;l&#355;i Prison, Comrat police detention facility). In these cases 
detainees are reportedly transferred from police custody and held for up two or three weeks in 
psychiatric institutions, officially in order to make an assessment of their mental health 
condition.

</b>  Articles 13 (2) and 36 (2) (b) of the Law on psychiatric assistance.

</b>  The Government explained that the excessive use of medication is conditioned by the lack of 
</p>
<p>alternative methods of treatment and the lack of availability of newly development medicine.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/44/Add.3

</p>
<p><b>Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova 
</b></p>
<p>45. According to several of his interlocutors, including detainees, progress has been made with 
improving conditions in the penitentiary system, e.g. functioning heating, food quality improved, 
HIV treatment in prisons commenced in September 2007. However, complaints about the poor 
quality and sometimes lack of food were common. The Special Rapporteur also received reports 
that international programmes are often not extended into the Transnistrian region of the 
Republic of Moldova, which means less out-reach in terms of health care and problems in 
particular with regard to tuberculosis treatment and a higher percentage of persons sick with 
tuberculosis and HIV. 
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that many human rights violations flow from the 
legislation in force, which, for instance, requires solitary confinement for persons sentenced to 
capital punishment and to life imprisonment and which prescribes draconic restrictions on 
contacts with the outside world. 
</p>
<p>47. Conditions in custody of the militia headquarters in Tiraspol were clearly in violation of 
minimum international standards. The Special Rapporteur considers that detention in the 
overcrowded cells with few sleeping facilities, almost no daylight and ventilation, 24 hours 
artificial light, restricted access to food and very poor sanitary facilities amounts to inhuman 
treatment. 
</p>
<p>48. Whereas the Special Rapporteur was unable to visit a psychiatric facility in the 
Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova, he has received allegations of detention in 
psychiatric clinics as a means to pressurize persons to comply. He also received credible 
allegations that conditions in Cocieri psychiatric clinic are not in compliance with international 
standards. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Women22 
</b></p>
<p><b>Trafficking 
</b></p>
<p>49. Whereas Moldova is widely considered to be a major source country of trafficking, the 
scale of the problem remains relatively unknown because most victims are not identified due to 
the absence of systematic identification processes in Moldova and some destination countries, as 
well as the inability or unwillingness of some victims to report their trafficking experiences. An 
indication of the actual volume is the total number of Moldovan nationals assisted as victims of 
trafficking by the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Between 2000 and 2007, this 
number amounted to 2227, which is extremely high.<b>23</b> Women constitute the majority of

</b>  See also report of the Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women to be submitted to 
</p>
<p>the 11th session of the Human Rights Council. 
<b>23
</b></p>
<p>  No official estimates of trafficking victims are available, but it is assumed that the actual 
numbers are even higher.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/44/Add.3 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p>trafficked persons and more than half of them are between the ages of 19 and 24. Women 
trafficked for sexual exploitation are usually subjected to additional human rights abuses 
including being beaten, raped, and sometimes killed. 
</p>
<p>50. The Government has taken steps to address the problem, e.g. in the first nine months 
of 2007, the Ministry of Interior reported that it conducted 62 raids to inspect 195 travel and 
employment agencies, and it withdrew the licenses of 14 (six travel and eight employment 
agencies) for suspected trafficking. The Prosecutor General&#8217;s Office reported that authorities 
initiated 507 trafficking investigations in 2007-including 17 criminal investigations under the 
child trafficking statute- which constitutes an increase from 466 investigations in 2006. 
Moldova&#8217;s Centre to Combat Trafficking in Persons (CCTIP) reported 251 trafficking 
prosecutions (out of which 107 sent to the courts) and 51 convictions of traffickers in 2007. 
In 2008, 96 criminal cases on trafficking were sent to courts. While the Government could not 
provide complete statistics on length of sentences for trafficking convictions, CCTIP reported 
that at least 50 traffickers convicted in 2007 are serving 7 to 10-year prison sentences. 
</p>
<p>51. In spite of the measures detailed above, the Special Rapporteur is concerned about 
consistent allegations that high-level officials may facilitate trafficking in exchange for financial 
gains and that widespread public corruption contributes to the ease with which vulnerable 
persons from Moldova are trafficked. Although in August 2006 several government 
investigators, prosecutors and senior officials - including the deputy director of the Centre to 
Combat Trafficking in Persons (CCTIP) - were dismissed from their posts for allegedly assisting 
a prominent trafficker and his syndicate, they have not been prosecuted. As a result, it appears 
that no official has been criminally punished for complicity in trafficking. 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur would like to recall the findings contained in his report to the 
Human Rights Council A/HRC/7/3, where he observed that in certain cases trafficking can 
amount to torture and/or ill-treatment, it the State fails to fulfil its due diligence and 
rehabilitation obligations in terms of the prevention of trafficking and the protection of 
individual victims. Also, the social exclusion resulting in some cases from past trafficking can 
lead to re-victimizing the victims and may amount to inhuman and degrading treatment. 
</p>
<p><b>Domestic violence 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur was informed that law enforcement agencies and the public at 
large lack awareness of the need to address domestic violence. He also observed that 
infrastructure to support survivors of domestic violence was lacking in most parts of the country 
(only one shelter existed in July 2008, which was privately run and situated in the capital). The 
Law on preventing and combating family violence<b>24</b> contains a number of important provisions, 
such as on the possibility of granting protective orders obliging the perpetrator to stay away from 
the victim, on cooperation between public administration and civil society organizations, on the 
protection of the security of the victim as a human rights principle, and on the possibility for 
third parties to file complaints.

</p>
<p><b>Women in detention 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur has received allegations that corporal punishment is regularly used 
in the Rusca Penitentiary for women. 
</p>
<p>55. Children of mothers sentenced to imprisonment can by law be accommodated in detention 
facilities with their mothers up to the age of three years (see Enforcement Code article 276). The 
Special Rapporteur welcomes the Government&#8217;s project to build a special wing at Pruncul 
penitentiary institution which would accommodate twelve female detainees with their children. 
</p>
<p><b>Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova 
</b></p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that, whereas the scale of trafficking in human-
beings appears to be significant in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova,<b>25</b> there is 
practically no infrastructure to prevent trafficking and assist the victims. Similarly, few measures 
have been taken to prevent violence against women, to protect individual victims and to ensure 
their rehabilitation. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  UNDERLYING CAUSES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Punitive penitentiary policies 
</b></p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur found that the legal framework and penitentiary policies in 
Moldova are punitive, directed at locking people up, rather than aimed at reintegrating prisoners 
in society. Whereas, from a human rights perspective, imprisonment per se carries certain 
limitations, namely the deprivation of liberty, other human rights should be affected only to a 
minimum. The Soviet-inspired system of a complex variety of security regimes decided by the 
judge, depending on the severity of the crime committed rather than on the danger that a detainee 
represents, is based on using restrictions of contacts with the outside world as a form of 
punishment and contradicts the principle that reformation and social rehabilitation should be the 
essential aim of imprisonment contained in Article 10 (3) of the ICCPR. 
</p>
<p>58. A clear sign of this are the extremely restrictive visiting policies and the numerous 
constraints to contacts with the outside world. The limitation to one short visit per month, 
combined with the often lengthy terms of imprisonment, runs against the aim of social 
rehabilitation and reintegration of prisoners in society. This is particularly true for contacts with 
family members, namely children.<b>26</b> Person sentenced to life imprisonment face even more 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>25
</b>  An indication of the extent of human trafficking from the Transnistrian region a is the number 
</p>
<p>of telephone calls placed to the new assistance/referral hotline launched in Transnistria in 2006: 
in just over eight months, the hotline received 1136 calls, out of which 239 were emergency 
crisis calls related to concrete cases of trafficking. In addition, during the period of 2000 to 2007 
IOM assisted 213 victims from Transnistria in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of 
Moldova. 
<b>26
</b></p>
<p>  The Government indicated that the number of visits granted to the detainees was steadily 
growing (a total of 22 short and long term visits per year). </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/44/Add.3 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>severe restrictions as they are allowed to be in contact only with their cell-mates. In addition the 
fact that persons sentenced to life-imprisonment have to wear handcuffs at all times, when the 
cell door is opened appears humiliating, notably in Rezina. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur 
regrets the introduction of the so-called &#8220;initial regime&#8221; (see above, para. 33) and notes that he 
has not seen the so-called &#8220;re-socialisation regime&#8221; being implemented anywhere. 
</p>
<p>59. Whereas the Special Rapporteur notes that some efforts are underway to improve 
sentencing policies, he is still concerned by the overly lengthy prison terms: in 2006 Moldova 
had sentenced only 0,3 per cent of all convicts to less than 1 year, but 21.4 to between 3 and 
5 years; 34.4 per cent between 5 and 10 years and 28.1 between 10 and 20 years - all well above 
the European average.<b>27</b> One of the consequences of these sentencing policies is that, in 2006, 
Moldova had a ratio of 224,5 incarcerated persons per 100 000 persons,<b>28</b> well above the average 
among Council of Europe members (105,1), even if the overall (total) number had decreased by 
7.9 per cent since 2005. According to the Minister of Justice, during the last months of 2006 and 
in 2007, the number decreased even further to 7400 persons in the penitentiary system (around 
217 per 100 000). 
</p>
<p><b>Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova 
</b></p>
<p>60. Also in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova the administration of justice 
system focuses on punitive aims rather than on reintegration, and there is a higher percentage of 
persons in detention than in the rest of the country. In some areas the restrictions placed on 
convicts are even stricter; e.g. solitary confinement is required for those convicted to life 
imprisonment or capital punishment. The mandatory complete solitary confinement for death 
row prisoners and persons sentenced to life imprisonment constitutes inhuman punishment 
(A/63/175, paras 77-85). 
</p>
<p>61. According to the so-called &#8220;Prison Administration&#8221; of the Transnistrian region of the 
Republic of Moldova, 628 persons per 100 000 are being held in penitentiary institutions, which 
is extremely high (see above: Council of Europe member States average: 105,1). 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Corruption and lack of resources 
</b></p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur recognizes that insufficient conditions in detention facilities, such 
as the lack of adequate food and access to health care, are aggravated by the lack of resources 
faced by some state institutions and that the lack of resources facilitates corruption. He would 
like to stress, however, that lack of resources cannot serve as an excuse for human rights 
violations and discriminatory practices.

<p>63. He received numerous and consistent allegations that corruption is deeply ingrained in 
Moldova&#8217;s criminal justice system. Several sources indicated that at every stage, starting from 
the police and the judiciary to the detention centres and prisons, corruption is a 
quasi-institutionalized practice.<b>29</b> The fact that the President, shortly before the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, dismissed some of the senior staff of the Ministry of Interior on charges of 
corruption is an indication for the seriousness of the problem. 
</p>
<p><b>Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova 
</b></p>
<p>64. According to many interlocutors, corruption is at least equally pervasive in the 
Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova and leads to discrimination at all stages of the 
criminal law cycle with wealthy persons less likely to be arrested, found guilty and sentenced to 
imprisonment. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Malfunctioning of protection mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b>Complaints mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>65. Numerous interlocutors indicated to the Special Rapporteur that in order to eradicate 
torture, a change in culture of the administration of justice system was urgently needed. The 
widely held idea that confessions are the &#8220;crown&#8221; of evidence needed to change. Whereas the 
Special Rapporteur recognizes that it is not easy to change &#8220;old habits&#8221;, he is of the opinion that, 
if the prevention and protection mechanisms provided for by the law start functioning in practice, 
and all the separate elements in the criminal law cycle fulfil their duties, the change in mentality 
will quickly follow suit. 
</p>
<p>66. Several avenues to file complaints are provided for by law.<b>30</b> In addition, the Department 
of Internal Security within the MoI examines complaints of individuals alleging violations by 
police officers and runs a telephone hotline for complaints. It can impose disciplinary sanctions 
against police officers found responsible for violations or, in case there is enough evidence to 
believe that a crime has been committed, send the case to the prosecutor&#8217;s office for criminal 
prosecution. By Ordinance No. 77 of 23 January 2006, pursuant to article 177 of the 
Enforcement Code, the so-called Complaints Committee was established to examine complaints 
submitted by detainees of penitentiary institutions. However, it never functioned in practice,

Administration, the Government/State Chancellery, judges, the Ministry of Health and Social

</p>
<p>partly because no financial compensation for its members was foreseen. The Parliamentary 
Advocate/Chair of NPM reported having received 1150 complaints in the year preceding the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, out of which approximately 50 per cent were related to ill-treatment. 
However, he had limited means of dealing with these complaints. 
</p>
<p>67. Overall, the Special Rapporteur found that the large majority of complaints are not 
properly investigated and rejected quasi-automatically. Equally, the fact that ex-officio 
investigations do not function in practice is a major concern. Judges, prosecutors or penitentiary 
personnel hardly ever initiate investigations, even if there is medical or other evidence that 
torture was committed. The fact that the system of internal remedies is dysfunctional is also 
illustrated by the relatively high number of violations of Article 3 ECHR found by the European 
Court of Human Rights in recent years. He identified the following reasons for this state of 
affairs: 
</p>
<p>(1) Wide discretion of the prosecutor 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The double role of the prosecutor as part of the investigation and &#8220;accuser&#8221; at the 
trial stage<b>31</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Although a refusal to initiate investigations into allegations of torture must be 
motivated, this is a largely formal requirement and the overwhelming majority is 
found &#8220;manifestly ill-founded&#8221; (according to the official statistics provided by the 
prosecutor&#8217;s office, only a relatively small percentage of complaints is pursued)<b>32</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The power of the prosecutor to allow or refuse independent medical examinations 
(according to many interlocutors, this is refused in the majority of cases) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The prosecutor is unlikely to denounce acts of torture committed by the police and 
therefore inspections conducted by the prosecutors are unlikely to be effective 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Complaints about inaction of the prosecutor&#8217;s office are to be filed with the 
prosecutor&#8217;s office (even if they are addressed to another office) 
</p>
<p>(2) Lack of independent medical examination 
</p>
<p>&#8226; At a later stage it is in the power of the penitentiary institution to allow or refuse 
independent medical examinations - seeing a specialized doctor can in fact take up 
to several months 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>&#8226; Whereas it is laudable that paramedics employed by the penitentiary 
administration respectively the police, are present in detention facilities during 
working hours on weekdays, they lack independence. In violation of the law that 
requires the doctor and/or the head of the penitentiary institution to inform the 
prosecutor of bruises or pain that may stem from ill-treatment,<b>33</b> in some cases no 
action is taken (ex from appendix B&#259;l&#355;i police station). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Similarly, forensic examinations to assess torture allegations are the exception 
rather than the rule and are often carried out too late. They also tend to only record 
the marks without indicating how they were caused. Also, the State Forensic 
Institute is underequipped. 
</p>
<p>(3) Judges and lawyers 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The lack of independence of judges who in many cases continue to follow the 
arguments of the prosecutor 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Not enough professional and independent lawyers/insufficient remuneration for 
them. In addition, although foreseen by law, the legal aid system is not effective. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Notwithstanding assertions to the contrary by the authorities, the Special 
Rapporteur received many allegations that the confidentiality of meetings with 
lawyers, in particular at the early stages of police custody, is often not respected 
</p>
<p>(4) Threats by police and non-action of penitentiary authorities and medical personnel 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Threats are routinely used by the police in order to deter detainees from filing 
complaints; in addition, the Special Rapporteur received a worrying number of 
allegations of reprisals against complainants 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The non-action of the staff of penitentiary institutions in cases of allegations of 
torture (e.g. in Balti and in Penitentiary Institution No.13 in Chi&#351;in&#259;u the prison 
directors indicated that, although many detainees arriving from police stations 
have injuries that might result from torture, in many cases no action is taken) 
</p>
<p>68. A key problem the Special Rapporteur has identified in this regard is the burden of proof - 
numerous interlocutors reported that, first of all, policemen were very good at avoiding leaving 
any traces and that secondly, ill-treated detainees were normally not transferred from police 
custody unless the marks have disappeared. However, according to international standards, if 
&#8220;allegations of torture or other forms of ill treatment are raised by a defendant during trial, the 
burden of proof should shift to the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the

</b>  Article 251 Enforcement Code and article 515 of the &#8220;Regulations on serving of sentences by

</p>
<p>confession was not obtained by unlawful means, including torture and similar ill-treatment&#8221;.<b>34</b> 
Moldova, as a matter of priority, should take decisive steps to implement the shift of the burden 
of proof in practice. 
</p>
<p><b>Disciplinary measures and prosecution of alleged perpetrators of torture 
</b></p>
<p>69. According to the Prosecutor General in recent years article 309 (1) has been increasingly 
applied: in 2007, a total of 282 complaints were received resulting in 44 criminal cases, out of 
which 21 were brought before the courts. 14 cases involving 26 persons ended in verdicts of 
guilt. By 6 June 2008, out of 145 complaints, 18 criminal cases had been initiated, 7 had been 
brought before the courts and 14 persons were found guilty. However, according to the 
information received by the Government, the penalties imposed were fines which are by no 
means commensurate the gravity of the acts. 
</p>
<p>70. Whereas the Special Rapporteur welcomes these developments, he also wishes to stress 
that these investigations and prosecutions can be considered only first steps and that the above 
figures (even if the prosecutions under Article 328 are included<b>35</b>) by no means reflect the actual 
scale of the torture and ill-treatment perpetrated in the country. In this context, he wishes to 
recall that the prosecution of acts of torture and ill-treatment (with adequate penalties) is crucial 
to eradicate the phenomenon of torture. 
</p>
<p><b>Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova 
</b></p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur was even more concerned about the lack of any functioning 
complaints mechanisms in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova: the &#8220;Human 
Rights Commissioner&#8221; as well as other local instances were perceived as totally ineffective and 
the possibility of using international remedies (such as a complaint to the ECHR) was less 
known of. In addition, detainees were quasi unanimous in their assessment that lawyers are not 
helpful, neither in terms of defence during a trial, nor in terms of protection from torture. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Weakness of prevention 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Monitoring and inspection 
</b></p>
<p>72. A number of bodies can conduct visits to places of detention, including the Penitentiary 
Commission,<b>36</b> the prosecutor&#8217;s office, an inspector for police custody facilities, the Department

</b>  See: General Recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on torture in E/CN.4/2003/68, 
</p>
<p>para. 26. 
<b>35
</b></p>
<p>  In 2007, 1532 complaints were filed under Article 328 (abuse of power) resulting in the 
opening of 143 criminal cases, out of which 72 were transmitted to the judiciary, 54 cases 
involving 71 persons. By 6 June 2008, out of 634 complaints, 65 criminal cases were initiated, 
and 37 were brought before court, which ended in 9 verdicts of guilt involving 12 persons.

<p>of Internal Security of the MoI; and the Parliamentary Advocated and NGO representatives. 
Additionally, the Special Rapporteur was informed that under the Civil Council new monitoring 
commissions, composed of representatives of the civil society, will be established. 
</p>
<p>73. In January 2008, amendments to the Law on Parliamentary Advocates adopted in 
July 2007, entered into force and led to the establishment in 2008 of an independent 
&#8220;Consultative Council&#8221;, which has been designated as National Preventive Mechanism (NPM) 
under the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. The Council is composed of 
eleven independent experts and one of the four parliamentary Advocates, acting as chair. This 
Council has the right to undertake unannounced visits to all places where persons can be 
deprived of their liberty and to conduct private interviews with all persons detained. It draws up 
reports of its findings, containing recommendations to improve the situation. The body&#8217;s 
secretariat is ensured by the Centre for Human Rights, an independent human rights body 
reporting to the Parliament. 
</p>
<p>74. Whereas the creation of the Consultative Council and the comprehensiveness of its 
mandate must be considered a milestone in terms of torture prevention in Moldova, it has started 
its work only recently so that it is too early to make an assessment of its effectiveness. Concerns 
have been expressed that insufficient resources have been put at its disposal. However, the 
Special Rapporteur was encouraged by the information he received about the 41 visits the 
Council has undertaken in the three months preceding his visit. He looks forward to learning 
how the NPM deals with some key-issues that had not been decided during his visit, e.g. the 
question of publicity, whether to take up individual cases etc. The Special Rapporteur is 
concerned that the draft law on the Civil Council, if adopted in its current form, might duplicate 
the functions of the existing NPM. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Safeguards 
</b></p>
<p><b>Excessive length of police custody 
</b></p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur is concerned by the long periods of police custody. Although 
article 18 of the Code of Police Ethics stipulates that deprivation of liberty shall, if possible, be 
limited and applied by taking into consideration the vulnerability of each detainee and must be 
registered, de-facto, most detainees are kept in police custody for several weeks/months and 
regularly return there for &#8220;further investigation&#8221; or for their trial or appeal, which makes them 
vulnerable to reprisals in the case they file complaint about ill-treatment Many of the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors indicated that detainees are only transferred to pretrial facilities once 
the marks resulting from torture are not visible anymore. However, the Special Rapporteur was 
informed that police detention facilities are to be transferred under the authority of the Ministry 
of Justice. 
</p>
<p><b>Evidence obtained under torture 
</b></p>
<p>76. In accordance with CCP article 94 (a) and (h), evidence obtained through violence, threats 
or other compelling methods is not admitted as evidence during the criminal court proceedings. 
However, the Special Rapporteur received numerous allegations that confessions obtained under 
torture are taken into consideration during court proceedings and that judges, prosecutors and 
other actors in the criminal law cycle routinely ignore allegations of torture. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/44/Add.3 
  page 25 
 
</p>
<p><b>Administrative detainees 
</b></p>
<p>77. Fewer safeguards are foreseen for administrative detainees (e.g. detention without judicial 
order for up to 10 days; no access to lawyers for up to 30 days), which allows the police to keep 
suspects in administrative detention without access to lawyers etc, and transform them into 
criminal suspects at a later stage. 
</p>
<p><b>Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova 
</b></p>
<p>78. In the Transnistrian legal framework not many legal safeguards exist and those that exist in 
law are not implemented in practice. Moreover, no independent torture monitoring mechanism 
has been enacted so far in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova. The Special 
Rapporteur encourages the newly established National Preventive Mechanism to extend its 
preventive monitoring visits also to places of detention in the Transnistrian region. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Lack of compensation and rehabilitation mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>79. Compensation is dealt with by a number of legal instruments, such as article 616 of the 
Civil Code<i>.</i> The Special Rapporteur has not received any evidence that the compensation 
mechanisms provided by the law work in practice. 
</p>
<p>80. For rehabilitation services for victims of torture the State relies on services provided by the 
non-governmental Medical Rehabilitation Centre for Torture Victims &#8220;Memoria&#8221;, which is 
providing excellent services. The Centre entirely depends on foreign funding and, therefore, is 
unable to cover the entire country. Rehabilitation therefore suffers from a lack of financial 
resources for the establishment of adequate facilities as well as for training of health personnel. 
The Special Rapporteur was very concerned to hear that recently the &#8220;Memoria&#8221; Centre and its 
staff were threatened at several instances. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The Republic of Moldova has come a long way in institution building and human 
rights protection since independence in 1991. By acceding to numerous international 
human rights treaties, it has sent strong signals about its commitment to put the rights of 
individuals at the centre of its legal system and its public policy formulation. Important 
steps have been taken to integrate these international standards into the national legal 
framework, including through the criminalization of torture. However, some gaps remain, 
such as the statute of limitations that applies to the crime of torture. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>On the basis of discussions with public officials, judges, lawyers and representatives 
of civil society, interviews with victims of violence and with persons deprived of their 
liberty, often supported by forensic medical evidence, the Special Rapporteur concludes 
that ill-treatment during the initial period of police custody is widespread. Torture 
methods such as severe beatings, with fists, rubber truncheons, and baseball bats, including 
on soles, electro-shocks, asphyxiation through gas masks, putting needles under fingernails 
and suspension are often used in order to obtain confessions from suspects. </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/10/44/Add.3 
page 26 
 
</p>
<p>83. <b>The commission of acts of torture is facilitated by the lack of awareness and action of 
other stakeholders in the criminal law system (such as prosecutors, judges, the medical 
profession and lawyers) and by the excessive length of police custody. Detention for several 
weeks or even months in police cells which do not comply with international minimum 
standards often amount to inhuman and degrading treatment.</b> 
</p>
<p>84. <b>Whereas overall conditions in penitentiary institutions have improved over recent 
years, overcrowding, diseases and inter-prisoner violence, as well as discriminatory practices 
fuelled by corruption remain highly problematic. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur is 
concerned about the severe restrictions on contacts with the outside world. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Special Rapporteur, recognizing that some first steps have been taken to address 
impunity, has found that the existing complaints mechanisms are not effective. He is 
particularly concerned that the burden of proof rests on the alleged victim of ill-treatment. 
In light of the high number of allegations he received, he concludes that only a small 
minority of perpetrators face criminal prosecution. Additionally, the penalties imposed are 
not commensurate with the gravity of the crime of torture. He further identified significant 
gaps with regard to the State&#8217;s obligations in the areas of compensation and rehabilitation. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The Special Rapporteur warmly welcomes the establishment of the National 
Preventive Mechanism. Since such monitoring bodies are among the most effective means 
of preventing torture, this, in his view, constitutes a major step towards preventing torture 
and ill-treatment in the future. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>With regard to violence against women, the Special Rapporteur is concerned about 
the scale of trafficking in women and girls, and the inadequate prevention and protection 
afforded by the State as well as the lack of measures to bring officials involved in 
facilitating trafficking to justice. He is similarly concerned about the lack of infrastructure 
for victims of trafficking and domestic violence. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>With regard to the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova, the Special 
Rapporteur comes to similar conclusions as for the rest of the country concerning the 
widespread use of ill-treatment by the police to extract confessions and the conditions of 
detention in police and penitentiary facilities. He regrets that no effective monitoring and 
complaints mechanisms, such as the National Preventive Mechanism are in place in the 
Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The death penalty is still enshrined in the &#8220;legislation&#8221; of the Transnistrian region of 
the Republic of Moldova and no steps were taken to abolish the death penalty. The Special 
Rapporteur is very concerned about life imprisonment in complete solitary confinement of 
persons sentenced to death or life imprisonment. Life-long detention in such conditions 
amounts to torture. </b></p>

<p><b>B.  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>In the spirit of cooperation and partnership, the Special Rapporteur recommends 
that the Government of the Republic of Moldova take decisive steps to implement the 
following recommendations: 
</b></p>

</b> <b>Abolish the statute of limitations for crimes of torture; 
</b></p>
<p><b> Establish effective and accessible complaints mechanisms; and protect complainants 
against reprisals; 
</b></p>
<p><b> An independent authority with no connection to the body investigating or prosecuting 
the case against the alleged victim should investigate promptly and thoroughly all 
allegations of torture and ill-treatment ex-officio; an independent forensic expert should 
carry out an examination in respect of all allegations of torture and ill-treatment; the 
Forensic institute should be equipped accordingly. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Safeguards and prevention37 
</b> <b>Reduce the period of police custody to a time limit in line with international 
standards (maximum 48 hours), after which transfer the detainees to a pretrial facility, 
where no further unsupervised contact with the interrogator or investigator should be 
permitted; 
</b></p>
<p><b> Ensure that no confessions made by persons in custody without the presence of a 
lawyer that are not confirmed before a judge are admissible as evidence against the 
persons who made the confession; Shift the burden of proof to the prosecution to prove 
beyond reasonable doubt that the confession was not obtained under any kind of duress; 
Judges, prosecutors and medical personnel should routinely ask persons arriving from 
police custody how they have been treated; Consider video and audio taping 
interrogations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> Regularly and following each transfer of a detainee undertake medical examinations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> Bring the legal safeguards for administrative detainees in line with international 
standards (limit to 48 hours, access to a lawyer etc.); 
 Ensure that the sound legal basis of the National Preventive Mechanism translates in 
its effective functioning in practice, including through allocation of budgetary and human 
resources.</b>

Evidence 
obtained under 
torture 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Many allegations that confessions 
obtained under torture are not 
excluded as evidence during court 
proceedings, in contravention of 
the national legislation<b>40</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Numerous reports that judges, 
prosecutors and other actors in the 
criminal law cycle routinely 
ignore allegations of torture 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Although the law provides for the 
possibility to use tape or video 
recording during interrogations,<b>41</b> 
these tools are not used in practice 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Burden of proof is on the victim 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Confessions made by persons in 
custody without the presence of a 
lawyer that are not confirmed 
before a judge shall not be 
admissible as evidence against the 
persons who made the confession 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Serious consideration should be 
given to video and audio taping of 
interrogations, including of all 
persons present 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The burden of proof should shift 
to the prosecution to prove 
beyond reasonable doubt that the 
confession was not obtained under 
any kind of duress 
</p>
<p>Medical 
checks in 
detention 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Paramedics are present in 
detention facilities of the police 
and the penitentiary system during 
working hours on weekdays, but 
the rules do not spell out when 
medical examinations should take 
place and so checks 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Examinations are done only 
superficially; in some cases 
bruises or pain are registered, but 
no action is taken 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The paramedics are employees of 
the penitentiary system 
respectively the police, and, 
therefore, lack independence 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Medical personnel are well-placed 
to contribute to preventing torture, 
since they would be able to record 
the state of health of all detainees 
who are often sent back and forth 
between the police custody 
facility and the pretrial detention 
centre, but examinations need to 
be done regularly and following 
each transfer of a detainee

<p><b>PLACES OF DETENTION VISITED AND INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur conducted visits to detention facilities unannounced and was able 
to hold private interviews with detainees in all facilities he visited. If detainees did not wish that 
their interviews are recorded, the information provided is only reflected in the general findings of 
the report. Some detainees only agreed to an anonymous publication of their interviews. In its 
official response of 19 January 2009, the Government promised to thoroughly examine all the 
cases mentioned below. 
</p>
<p><b>Rusca prison No. 7, penitentiary for women 
(Visited on 5 July 2008) 
</b></p>
<p>2. <b>General information</b>:<b> </b>The officer in charge who received the Special Rapporteur and 
provided general information was Antom Rotaru. 293 inmates were held at the time of the visit, 
among them 9 minors. 2 women on hunger strike were kept in the so-called &#8220;carcer&#8221;. Officer 
Rotaru informed the Special Rapporteur that the longest period a person could spend in solitary 
confinement in the &#8220;carcer&#8221; was seven days. The prison system provided for three regimes, 
namely the initial, joint and re-socialisation regimes. In the initial regime the detainees had to 
spend 3, 6 or 9 months confined to a cell for 23 hours per day. The length of the initial regime 
depended on the court sentence. At the time of the visit, 71 women were under the initial regime. 
A special regime of separation cells, similar to the initial regime, was put up for detainees who 
violated prison rules. Those sanctioned could be held in separation cells with four detainees for 
up to one year. However, according to the officer in charge, they were actually only held for six 
months. Under this regime only short term visits were permitted. The detainees were allowed to 
walk in a concrete courtyard for two hours per day. At the time of the visit children were not 
allowed to stay with their mothers, but a unit for mothers with children up to three years was 
under construction. 
</p>
<p>3. Prison staff was comprised of 11 officers, 26 sub-officers and 20 guards. 5 senior guards 
were male, the rest were female. Minors were held in separate cells but spent the days together 
with adults in the joint regime. The detainees had the right to receive 4 long-time visits (3 days) 
per year and 4 short-time visits every 3 months. 
</p>
<p>4. According to the doctor, all persons, upon arrival, underwent a general medical 
examination and were checked for HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Furthermore, there was a 
methadone programme available for drug addicts. A gynaecologist, a psychiatrist and a 
neuro-pathologist came twice a week to the prison, a dentist every day. Newly arrived detainees 
were put under quarantine for 15 days. The detainees received food three times per day. 
</p>
<p>5. According to information provided by the Government, the Department of Penitentiary 
Institutions, in cooperation with the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, recently 
conducted renovation works in Rusca Prison. New medical facilities and a station of water 
purification were built. </p>

</p>
<p>6. <b>Natalia Shalamova</b>, aged 28, had been arrested when she was 21 years old and had 
spent 8 years in prison. After being transferred from the initial regime to the joint regime, she 
had an argument with the prison administration over a visit to the prison doctor and was put in a 
separation cell, where she spent six months. She then received a sanction and had to spend 
another six months in the separation cell. She was also locked into the &#8220;carcer&#8221; once for seven 
days in relation with a fight between detainees. While in separation regime, she was allowed to 
walk outside one hour in the morning and one in the afternoon. Detainees violating prison rules 
were generally sanctioned with one year in a separation cell. On the other hand, the initial regime 
was usually only used for two months due to lack of available cells. She often encountered 
difficulties when she wishes to see a prison doctor. Under criminal investigation it was normal to 
get beaten if one was suspected of a serious crime. She lost her child because of beatings during 
her interrogation. 
</p>
<p>7. <b>L.Z.</b> alleged that she had been beaten two weeks before the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit by 
the officer in charge, Antom Rotaru. She was ordered to go into her cell but stayed outside to 
finish her cigarette. The officer shouted at her and tried to hit her. One day later she was taken to 
his office, where he beat her violently. He hit her in the chest and on her head and twisted her 
arm. Another guard was in the room witnessing the beatings. She had bruises and still suffered 
from headaches. She was held in the separation cell because she suffered from mental problems 
and tried to commit suicide by slitting her veins. Because of her mental problems, she was 
constantly provoked and beaten and kicked by the male guards. The female guards never 
ill-treated her. 
</p>
<p>8. <b>Inga Tcaci</b>, aged 28, was arrested on 4 August 2004 at her home. On 9 August 2004, she 
was transferred to the SIZO of B&#259;l&#355;i Prison No. 11. In the quarantine cell of the SIZO she was 
infected with tuberculosis, a skin disease and her eye-sight got impaired. Later she got pregnant 
from another inmate of the SIZO, where male and female detainees were kept together. On 
27 October 2005 she was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment, which was reduced to seven years 
on appeal. From 6 March 2006 to September 2006 she was detained at Pruncul prison hospital 
since she had a difficult pregnancy and was still suffering from tuberculosis. On 
7 November 2006 she gave birth to a boy in the SIZO of B&#259;l&#355;i. The baby was taken from her and 
was living with his grandparents. Initially, the birth of the boy was not registered, but after she 
complained, a birth certificate was issued. On 13 June 2008 she was transferred to Rusca and put 
under quarantine. Since 23 June she was held in the &#8220;carcer&#8221; in solitary confinement for being on 
hunger strike. The reason for the hunger strike was that she wanted to be confined together with 
her child at Pruncul prison, where a special mother-and-child unit existed. If she wished to give 
up the hunger strike, she had to write a respective note. She regularly drank water but still felt 
very bad. A doctor came to see her two to three times per day and checked her blood pressure 
and gave her medication as well as injections. She had not been threatened with force feeding. 
Although she was told that she was not suffering from tuberculosis anymore she still felt some of 
the symptoms. Neither in the SIZO nor at Rusca Prison had she been ill-treated. However, in her 
view, the prison management of B&#259;l&#355;i was responsible for her bad health condition since, since 
she had been infected with tuberculosis in the quarantine cell, where healthy and sick persons 
were detained together and the hygienic situation was dreadful. When in police detention in the </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/44/Add.3 
page 36 
 
</p>
<p>investigation department of B&#259;l&#355;i, she was taken out of her cell at 9 p.m. and taken to an office 
where she was beaten by a policeman with his fists in order to make her confess to a second 
crime. She was beaten until 2 or 3 a.m. the next morning and then returned to her cell. The 
bruises only disappeared approximately one month later. She complained to the Helsinki 
Committee but never received an answer. She had also complained to the prosecutor&#8217;s office for 
causing her diseases such as tuberculosis and an ulcer. 
</p>
<p>9. <b>Natalia Grigore Franco</b>, aged 25, was arrested on 7 June 2006 at Chi&#351;in&#259;u airport, 
handcuffed and transferred to Cahul where she was held for 15 days at the temporary isolator. 
She had to sleep on the floor. The toilet consisted of a bucket which had to be used in front of the 
other detainees. She then managed to bail herself out by paying 10&#180;000 Lei. On 19 March 2007, 
she was found guilty of trafficking and sentenced to seven years of imprisonment. The first six 
weeks of her prison sentence she spent in the Cahul penitentiary institution. Then she was 
detained for two weeks at Penitentiary n. 13. Conditions of detention were better at Rusca Prison 
than in other detention facilities. The first nine months at Rusca Prison she was held in the initial 
regime and was allowed to leave her cell only for one hour a day. 
</p>
<p>10. <b>Female detainee</b>, was arrested in March 2004 and held at the police temporary isolator in 
Ocnita for 30 days. It was very dirty, dark and cold, there was no heating and a hole that they had 
to use as toilet. She had to sleep directly on the floor. She got a skin disease and was refused 
medical treatment. After 30 days she was transferred to B&#259;l&#355;i SIZO, but she had to go back and 
forth between the SIZO and Ocnita police station. The prison is ok, but the water is very bad. 
</p>
<p>11. <b>Female detainee</b>, was arrested in September 2004 and held in Ocnita for 10 months, 
mostly on her own. At several occasions she lost consciousness and the doctors indicated that 
this was due to the lack of oxygen. The worst thing in the prison is that the women are forced to 
do hard work for two hours a day on the construction sites in the prison. Whereas their terms 
should be reduced in exchange for this, they effectively receive nothing. Furthermore, the 
conditional release system does not work. <b>44</b> 
</p>
<p>12. <b>Female detainee</b>, was arrested in Chi&#351;in&#259;u in 2003 and held in a police temporary isolator 
for three months. During interrogation, she was made to do the &#8220;sparrow&#8221; (handcuffed behind 
her back; her feet tied together with metal wire; and then suspended face down from a metal 
stick fixed between two chairs) for three hours and repeatedly beaten. She was not allowed to see 
anybody while the marks were visible.

</b></p>
<p>15. <b>Anna (Annushka)</b>, aged 22.<b>45</b> In November 2006 she was approached by a stranger in a 
park in Chi&#351;in&#259;u, who proposed to bring her abroad and provide her with work as a housekeeper 
and caretaker of elderly people. She suffered from diabetes and decided to take the offer because 
insulin was very expensive and she wanted to support her family by working abroad. She did not 
tell her parents and left with the stranger, two other men and one woman towards Poland in a 
minibus. At one stage they were running through the woods to Italy and then went by train to 
Switzerland, where the driver picked them up again. She was brought to Geneva and locked into 
a room in a house. The other woman was also locked into a different room. She was not given 
enough food or any insulin. She was locked in for several weeks. The man who initially 
approached her came and went regularly. He wanted her to work in a brothel, but she refused. 
Each time he came he beat her. She screamed for help, but to no avail. The door of the room was 
locked and the windows were barred. One day she decided to flee. When the man came into the 
room she hit him with a chair and escaped. She could not remember what happened afterwards. 
Eventually, she woke up on a park bench with a broken leg. A woman who found her took her to 
a hospital, where she stayed for three months. As a result of the lack of insulin she was losing her 
sight. When she was detained in the house she could still see, but later in hospital she had lost 
50 per cent of her eye sight. On 15 February 2007, she was deported to Moldova where a 
representative of the shelter picked her up from the airport. The Red Cross had established the 
contact. After her return to Moldova she stayed with her family. However, her father was an 
alcoholic and when the grandmother started threatening her to hand over money which she 
thought Anna had earned in Switzerland, she decided to move out together with her 18 year old 
sister, who was now looking after her since she turned completely blind in November 2007. As a 
child she and her sister had often been beaten by their father when they tried to defend their 
mother. The shelter provided her with food and medical assistance and helped her with finding 
an apartment. She was still afraid that the man who had locked her into the house in Geneva 
might be looking for her. 
</p>
<p>16. <b>Two women and one girl</b> aged 9<b>, </b>from Dubasari (Transnistria). Upon the proposition of 
an unknown woman who offered them work in Turkey, the two women and the girl travelled to 
Turkey in 2005. Upon arrival in Turkey they were taken to a factory where they had to work 
from 8.30 a.m. to 12 p.m. every day. Their passports were taken away. They had no proper place 
to live, but slept in the factory under a table. In the evening the grandmother and the mother were 
sometimes forced to render sexual services. Under the pretext to make a copy of their passports 
they requested their documents and fled leaving all their belongings behind. In Istanbul, they 
found another factory which employed them for a salary of approximately 50 USD per month.

</b>  This case, among others, illustrates that, while in Moldova violence within the private sphere 
</p>
<p>has been found the most prevalent form of abuse women face, the risk of such abuse and 
ill-treatment are particularly manifest in the context of irregular migration often intersecting with 
trafficking fur the purposes of sexual and labour exploitation. Often women who are trafficked 
have previously been victims of domestic violence. </p>

</p>
<p>With the help of the wife of their chief in the factory they took the child, then 6 years old, back 
to Moldova since she was sick. The two women worked in the factory for nearly two years but 
could hardly survive. They were under complete control of their boss and were allowed to buy 
food only when accompanied by him. In the evenings they sometimes worked as prostitutes in 
order to earn enough money to survive. Eventually, they fled from the factory and stayed at a 
pension for three days. On the third day their boss found them and brought them back to the 
factory, where they were beaten up and forced to work for free. One of the women succeeded to 
call the police from a public phone. Consequently, everybody was arrested and the two women 
were taken to a shelter in Istanbul from which they were transferred to the shelter in Chi&#351;in&#259;u. 
The first two weeks after their return they stayed at their home with the child. Then they spent 
three weeks at the shelter in Chi&#351;in&#259;u where they were provided with clothing as well as medical 
and psychological treatment. In addition, the shelter supported them in reintegrating in 
Transnistria.

<p>17. <b>General information</b>:<b> </b>The Special Rapporteur was received by Mihail Matasari, Deputy 
Chief of Personnel and Education, and Serghei Juravets, Head of the Temporary Isolator. The 
temporary isolator, located in the basement of the building, consisted of eight cells. On the day 
of the visit only two cells were used; two persons were held in one of them and six persons in the 
other. The cells were not equipped with toilets, but only plastic buckets. There was no natural 
light, and no mattresses were provided to the detainees. Two times per day the detainees were 
allowed to go to a water closet outside the cells. Shower facilities were under construction but, 
thus far, the detainees could not take a shower, even if administrative detainees could be held for 
up to 30 days. Only following some discussions, the Special Rapporteur was also granted access 
to the three &#8220;detox cells&#8221; (used for holding intoxicated persons), where no detainee was held on 
the day of the visit. 
</p>
<p>18. In the course of the visit, the Special Rapporteur received allegations of acts of 
ill-treatment at the police station, notably in offices n. 13, 15 and 25 of the criminal investigation 
department. According to the information he received, the treatment consisted mostly of beatings 
or the &#8220;sparrow&#8221; (a detainee handcuffed behind his/her back; his/her feet tied together with metal 
wire and then suspended face down from a metal stick fixed between two chairs). A deputy chief 
of the police station conformed that the detainees could be interrogated in any room or office 
although Serghei Juravets had claimed that they were only interrogated in a special room in the 
basement close to the cells. Most of the victims were reportedly kept in detention in the 
temporary isolator until the bruises caused by the ill-treatment were no longer visible. The 
perpetrators mentioned by victims were officers Oleg Shuba and Serghei Vatrici.

</b>20. <b>General information</b>:<b> </b>The Special Rapporteur was received by Director Teodor Pascaru. 
On the day of the visit the prison held a total of 445 inmates out of whom 15 were women and 
12 minors (male). 280 persons were held in pretrial detention and 165 were convicted prisoners. 
Out of the 165 convicted prisoners 129 were held under the &#8220;initial regime&#8221; and 36 under the 
&#8220;joint regime&#8221;. Detainees in the initial regime were allowed to spend two hours per day outside 
their cells. The prisoners in the joint regime were in charge of maintenance of the prison. 
6 detainees had tuberculosis and 10 were infected with HIV/AIDS. The prison had a total staff 
of 184, of whom 46 were women. The institution had two quarantine cells and six single cells 
used for punishment and isolation. Detainees could be held for up to 20 days in the punishment 
cell, minors only for a maximum of 10 days. About six weeks earlier, a detainee committed 
suicide in an isolation cell. He had been separated for smuggling drugs and money into the 
prison and hanged himself with his own trousers. In the course of the preceding six months, 
approximately 30 persons had been on hunger strike. In accordance with the CPC, hunger 
strikers had to be kept in separate cells until they give up the strike. In 2005, one person had to 
be force fed. Additionally, persons who were violating prison rules in other colonies were 
brought to B&#259;l&#355;i Prison No. 11 for punishment. 
21. Director Pascaru informed the Special Rapporteur that newly arrived detainees or detainees 
returning from police stations underwent a medical examination automatically. In the event that 
they carried bruises or marks, those were recorded, and internal investigations were initiated. 
In 2007, four or five such cases were recorded and, in the first half of 2008, two or three cases. 
Detainees were transferred to B&#259;l&#355;i Prison from twelve different police stations in the region. The 
Director knew that people were afraid of being brought to the police station in B&#259;l&#355;i because 
there were rumours that they were beaten up there. According to Director Pascaru, some of the 
detainees had serious wounds when they arrived from a police isolator but some also claimed 
that they have been tortured without being able to present any marks. In a few cases the doctor 
had registered torture marks, but then the detainee refused to file formal complaints needed for 
launching an internal investigation. Before the detainees were transferred to the SIZO, they 
stayed at police stations between 24 hours and one week, sometimes also longer. They were 
often brought to the SIZO and then taken back to the police station for another week. 
Interrogations could take place in a special building for investigations or directly at the police 
stations, where in his opinion more torture took place. He could think of only one case which 
was brought to the attention of the prosecutor a couple of years ago, but the allegations could not 
be substantiated. 
</p>
<p>22. The persons detained longest at B&#259;l&#355;i Prison No. 11 had been there for eight years. In the 
SIZO, persons were held for up to 18 months. 
</p>
<p>23. <b>Ludmila Tibulico</b>, aged 35, was arrested at the market in B&#259;l&#355;i, together with her husband 
on 15 June 2008 and taken to the police station in B&#259;l&#355;i. The next day, she was interrogated by 
police officer Mr Plomadeala in the investigation room at the Criminal Investigation Section. 
During the interrogation she was beaten on her buttocks and her back with a rubber stick and a 
rubber pipe in order to make her confess. The ill-treatment caused bruises on her back. After she 
confessed, she was released. After her release she went to the prosecutor in order to file a </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/44/Add.3

</p>
<p>complaint because of the ill-treatment she was subjected to. Pursuant to her complaint, she was 
arrested again and detained for one week in the police station in B&#259;l&#355;i. One week later she was 
transferred to the pretrial section (SIZO) of B&#259;l&#355;i Prison. Upon arrival at the prison she 
underwent a medical check-up. However, by then the bruises caused by the ill-treatment were no 
longer visible. She made no allegations of any ill-treatment in the SIZO. 
</p>
<p>24. <b>Vasiili Proclan</b>, aged 44, convicted, had been in detention at B&#259;l&#355;i prison for two years and 
three months. Prior to this, he had been held for 7 months in pretrial detention in Ocnita. In 
Ocnita, he was taken out of his cell and dragged along the corridor and beaten by the staff. He 
lodged a complaint with the prosecutor, but no action was taken. He made no allegations of 
ill-treatment at B&#259;l&#355;i prison but informed the Special Rapporteur that he was currently on hunger 
strike, because the prison authorities had stopped to register complaints by detainees to national 
and international bodies or mechanisms since 1 June 2008. 
</p>
<p>25. <b>Vasile Dolgan</b>, aged 29, was arrested in 2004 and convicted to eight years&#8217; imprisonment, 
of which he had already served 3 years. He was brought to B&#259;l&#355;i from Rezina prison the day 
before the visit of the Special Rapporteur without knowing the reason for his transfer. After his 
arrest he was tortured during his interrogation in Stra&#351;eni police station. He was suspended 
between a chair and a table in the &#8220;sparrow&#8221; position, with an iron stick put between his cuffed 
hands and feet behind his back. In this position he was left for two hours and repeatedly hit on 
the soles of his feet. Afterwards, he was brought back to his cell. The ill-treatment continued 
until he eventually confessed to a crime he had not committed. He complained to his State 
appointed lawyer, who did not take note of the complaint. He also asked for a doctor but was 
denied medical assistance. The first two years of his prison term he had spent in Chi&#351;in&#259;u; then 
one year in Rezina, where he had relatives. Although he did not complain of ill-treatment in B&#259;l&#355;i 
Prison No. 11, he still wanted to be transferred back to Rezina. 
</p>
<p>26. <b>Detainee</b>, aged 30, was arrested three days before the visit in B&#259;l&#355;i and taken to B&#259;l&#355;i 
police station. At the time of arrest no violence was used and he was locked immediately into 
one of the basement cells. He stayed in the police station from 3 July, 5 p.m. to 4 July, 9 a.m. He 
was not questioned while in police detention. However, during an earlier arrest in May 2007, he 
had been severely tortured by police officers in B&#259;l&#355;i police station. He was beaten with a 
screwdriver on his legs. He was hit and kicked in the chest and two times in his kidneys, and his 
head was banged against the wall. On the second floor of the criminal investigation department 
in B&#259;l&#355;i he was electrocuted two times with a black tool with two electrodes. The torture took 
place from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. One of the wounds got chronically infected. He showed clear 
handcuff marks on his wrist and first claimed that he tried to break the handcuff while being 
transported to the police station. When examined by the forensic expert, he disclosed that he had 
been suspended on the cuffs from the ceiling of a local police station for ten minutes. With 
regard to a large burning wound on his hand he claimed that he had burnt it accidentally on a 
heating device. He confessed to the crime he was suspected of because he could not stand the 
pain of the torture any longer. He had complained to the prosecutor of the ill-treatment, but the 
accused officer, Anatolii Bidiac, was acquitted. 
</p>
<p>27. <b>Slobodaniuk Veaceslav</b>, aged 58, was arrested on 23 February 2008 in B&#259;l&#355;i and taken to 
the police station. There, five drunken police officers broke one of his ribs and his hand joint and 
seriously injured his knee. He could not see after the beatings because his eyes were completely 
swollen. The beatings took place in an office on the second floor of the main building and lasted </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/44/Add.3 
  page 41 
 
</p>
<p>for one hour. He was beaten with bare hands and a rubber baton. One of the officers had been 
serving in Afghanistan and told him that he would now learn how the Afghan police was treating 
criminals. After the beatings he was hidden in a &#8220;detox cell&#8221; and in an office for six days until 
the swellings disappeared. He was not hospitalized. Only once transferred to the SIZO, he was 
helped by prison paramedics who took note of his injuries. However, he did not know whether 
these were reported anywhere. He had sent complaints to the Supreme Court and to diverse 
human rights organizations. 
</p>
<p>28. <b>A female detainee</b> alleged having been held in a psychiatric hospital and given injections 
for two months against her will. She was also held in police detention for six months in poor 
conditions (leaking toilet, no water to wash, insects everywhere, overcrowding, only 10 minutes 
of walk). She has an 18 months old child, who she had not been allowed to see for four months 
after her arrest.

<p>29. <b>General information</b>: The Special Rapporteur was received by Dr. Angela Donciuc, who 
provided the following information: The hospital hosted more than 700 patients, who were 
separated according to different regimes. Criminals with psychiatric impairments and persons 
with acute psychiatric problems had to undergo forced treatment in the most restraint regime. 
Forced treatment of criminals was based on a court decision and the length of the treatment was 
determined by the judge. In other cases, the maximum duration of treatment of children was 
26 days, and of adults 35 days. Patients under forced treatment are under permanent supervision. 
The clinic did not use any physical restraint mechanisms; in case of violent behaviour or 
aggression, the patients received medication. Dr. Donciuc explained that no complaint 
mechanism was necessary since the patients did not complain. In the children&#8217;s section, 
74 children up to the age of 18 were held at the time of the visit. According to the medical doctor 
of the team of the Special Rapporteur, who examined some of the patients&#8217; dossier, including the 
children, receive a very high daily dose of tranquilizer. The closed ward was in a deplorable state 
where the patients appeared to be in apathy, owing to extensive use of medication.

Lieutenant Colonel Grigore Andrei Copiimulti, and the chief of the temporary isolator, 
Oleg Casaiman. The police station had eight cells. On the day of the visit, three persons were 
kept in custody in three different cells. The Special Rapporteur received complaints about the 
quantity and quality of food and the short time detainees were allowed to be in the courtyard. 
The detainees had a bucket in their cells and were taken to a proper toilet once a day. Detainees 
were allowed to receive visits. 
</p>
<p>31. <b>Detainee</b> was arrested in Cimi&#351;lia city on 29 April 2008 by the police for being involved in 
a fight. He was informed of the charges against him and no violence was used during arrest. He 
was first brought to the police station in Cimi&#351;lia and later transferred to Cahul Prison. Since his 
arrest he had been transferred back to Cimi&#351;lia twice because the prosecutor needed to see him 
for investigation. The conditions of detention were much better in Cahul Prison. All together, he </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/44/Add.3

</p>
<p>was in Cahul Prison twice for 10 days each. The rest of the time in detention he had spent in the 
police station. He was allowed to walk in the police station&#8217;s courtyard for about 5 to 10 minutes 
per day. Sometimes he was detained with others, but mostly he was alone in his cell. For lunch 
he received soup and porridge; he did not get any food from his family. Since his arrest he had 
lost 20 kilograms and was in a permanent state of hunger. He had a State appointed lawyer 
whom he did not trust. His court hearings had been postponed twice; he saw a judge the first 
time after his arrest in mid-June. His file was only written in Latin script, which he did not 
understand. The interrogator treated him well and the guards were also friendly. 
</p>
<p>32. <b>Detainee</b> was arrested by the police about one month before the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit 
in C&#259;u&#351;eni district at work. No force was used during his arrest. His initial detention was 
prolonged by the judge first for 3 days and later for 10 respectively 20 days. He was not properly 
questioned but only asked for a confession which he could not give. He was well treated by the 
police officers and guards. He still suffered from an older stabbing wound and an operation in his 
abdomen but did not receive any medication for the pain. He was allowed to walk outside for 
half an hour per day. 
</p>
<p>33. <b>Detainee</b> was arrested by the police on 8 May 2008 in Cimi&#351;lia. Since that day, he had 
been held in detention at the police station. The detention was prolonged by a judge several 
times. The detainee made no allegations of ill-treatment, but said he lacked a blanket to protect 
him during cold days. He was taken out of the cell to a small outdoor courtyard for 20 to 
30 minutes per day and to take a shower every second day. The last 24 days he had spent alone 
in his cell and said that he suffered from the solitude. From 1996 to 2005 the detainee already 
served a prison sentence of nine years in Cricova Colony and Goieni Colony. In February 2007, 
he was arrested again and taken to Cimi&#351;lia police station. At that time, he was taken to an office 
in the police station and was handcuffed behind his back. Then his hands and arms were 
forcefully pushed upward by a police man; a movement which caused him pain in his shoulders.

Vasilii Stoianiglo. Four cells were located in the police station&#8217;s basement. The cells were dark 
and badly ventilated. On the day of the visit, five detainees were held in two different cells. 
Another person who obviously suffered from a psychiatric impairment was locked into a single 
cell. The guards explained that that man was brought to the police station on a regular basis and 
was administratively detained for 15 days every time. All detainees interviewed by the Special 
Rapporteur declared that they had no right to visits, which was confirmed by the Commissioner. 
They were allowed to walk in a caged yard for one hour per day. They could use the toilet one or 
two times per day. Otherwise they had to use a bucket in the cell without any privacy. The 
detainees claimed that they received food one time per day at lunch time and were otherwise 
dependent on food parcels from their family. However, the Commissioner told the Rapporteur 
that the detainees received food three times per day. Whereas the Special Rapporteur received 
consistent allegations of beatings at Comrat police station, notably by Nicolai Arnaut, 
Ivan Cristoglo, Andrei Aladov and in particular Andrei Sirkeli or Sercheli, the Commissioner 
had not received any complaints of ill-treatment from the detainees. </p>

<p>35. <b>Roma Kiaroglo</b>, aged 21, was arrested on 12 January 2008 in Ceadar Lunga by the police, 
near his house. He was brought to the police station of Ceadar Lunga were he was interrogated in 
several offices by a total of seven police officers in civilian clothes from 4 p.m. to 1 a.m. During 
that time, he was beaten with fists and with baseball bats wrapped in cloth on his head to make 
him confess to a crime which he had not committed. The beatings caused severe pain and a small 
deformation on his head. After nine hours of ill-treatment Roma Kiaroglo partly confessed to the 
crime. At 1 a.m. he was put in a car and driven to a forest, where he was taken out of the car and 
handcuffed. A dark plastic bag was put over his head, which was closed with a band around his 
neck. In this position electroshock was applied to his genitals. Since he could not see anything 
because of the dark plastic bag over his head, he could not say which instrument was used for the 
electrocuting. He was then driven to the police stations of Comrat, Bessarabesca, Taraclia and 
back to Ceadar Lunga at 6 a.m. in the morning. In each police station he was put into an office or 
a cell and left alone for some time. Between the stops at the police stations he was tortured 
several times by the above-described methods either in the car or in forests. He saw a State 
lawyer at 1 a.m. and at 6 a.m. in the morning in Ceadar Lunga, where he finally confessed. He 
was held in custody for four days at the police station in Ceadar Lunga and then transferred to 
the police station in Comrat. On 15 February he was transferred to Penitentiary n. 13 in Chi&#351;in&#259;u, 
where he was held for another four days. He was subsequently transferred to the Psychiatric 
Institution Costiujeni, officially in order to check if he suffered from any psychiatric impairment. 
After his three-week long detention there, he was held for another four days in Chi&#351;in&#259;u. On 
7 March, he was transferred back to Comrat Police Station. On 28 March he was taken to Cahul 
Penitentiary, where he was detained in the SIZO until 18 April. On that day he was transferred 
again to Comrat police station where he was detained in the basement for another 90 days. On 
4 July 2008 he was convicted to 28 years of imprisonment. He informed the Special Rapporteur 
that he would be transferred the following day to Cahul Penitentiary Institution where he would 
serve his sentence. With the help of his third lawyer, whom he hired privately, Roma Kiaroglo 
lodged a complaint with the prosecutor regarding the torture he was subjected to on 22 and 
23 January. The complaint was not taken up for lack of evidence. During the five months terms 
he had spent in police custody and pretrial detention, his mother was allowed to visit him once 
for one hour at Cahul penitentiary institution in May. Roma Kiaroglo wrote his mother ten letters 
which he gave to the police or the prison authorities; but none of the letters reached her. His 
mother was allowed to send him clothes and food. The findings of the forensic expert of the team 
of the Special Rapporteur fully corroborated the allegation of electrocuting on the genitals with 
medical evidence. 
</p>
<p>36. <b>Detainee</b>, aged 18, was arrested by the police in the street in Ceadar Lunga in 
January 2008. During the arrest, no force was used. He was taken to Ceadar Lunga police 
station, where he was held for six days. During his interrogation in Ceadar Lunga, he was beaten 
by an unknown number of police officers and forced to confess. He was hit with a baseball bat 
wrapped in a cloth on his legs, back, head, arms and hands. He was forced to kneel on a chair so 
that the officers could beat him on his soles. Additionally, he was beaten through a black folder 
placed on his head. He was threatened with being taken outside to the woods and beaten even 
stronger if he did not confess. The police officers showed him pictures and told him what to say 
until he finally confessed. The beating went on for nine hours at night in an office of the criminal 
police. Later he was retuned to his cell but was not allowed to see a doctor. Six days after his 
arrest, he was transferred to Comrat, where a doctor saw him but did not examine his body 
properly. He told the doctor of the ill-treatment, but the man did not react and told him that </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/44/Add.3

</p>
<p>everything was alright. During this 15 minute examination police officers were present. Only 
when the signs of torture had disappeared, he was taken to the hospital. Although he was also 
interrogated in Comrat, he was not ill-treated there. He was transferred back and forth from 
Cahul Penitentiary several times. He was finally convicted in July 2008 for a crime which he had 
not committed. In addition, he was only 17 when the crime was committed. At Comrat police 
station he was awaiting his appeal trial. A State appointed lawyer was assigned to him, but he 
was not very helpful. He also complained to the judge and the prosecutor about the ill-treatment, 
but both refused to act.

<p>37. <b>Ruslan Chindighilean</b>, aged 17, was arrested by police wearing civilian clothes 
on 7 February 2008 in the street in Comrat. He was beaten during the arrest and some marihuana 
was placed in his pocket. He was also beaten during the interrogation in order to make him 
confess, but he managed to run away. On 7 April 2008, he was again arrested and taken to 
Comrat police station. He was interrogated for ten minutes and beaten. The beatings first took 
place in office no. 6 on the 2nd floor. He was punched and kicked and told that he should not 
expect any mercy. A number of criminal police officers in civilian clothes went in and out and 
participated in the beatings. The officers also used folders to beat him and forced him to stand in 
a stress position for 15 or 20 minutes. Additionally, he was threatened that he would be taken to 
the forest or the field and that a plastic bag would be put over his head or that he would be 
electrocuted. A friend of his had been electrocuted in Comrat in February. At night he was 
brought to a cell in the basement. After half an hour the officers came back and beat him in the 
cell. Since his second arrest in April he spent more than two months in the police station and 
around 20 days in Cahul prison. He confessed to a theft because of the beatings. He did not 
complain to anyone because he did not know that he could do so. He had a State appointed 
lawyer who did not care about his case. 
</p>
<p>38. <b>Gheorghe Mihni</b>, aged 24, was arrested on 19 April 2008 and taken to Comrat police 
station. Except for ten days, when he was detained in Cahul Prison, he was always held in the 
police station. During the month of April he was interrogated by criminal police officers in an 
office on the second floor of the building. Every Saturday and Sunday, he was questioned and 
threatened in order to force him to confess. He was beaten all over his body with diverse tools, 
such as a rubber stick and a baseball bat. His head was banged against a metal safe. He was 
threatened with electroshocks and was shown the electroshock device they threatened to use on 
him outside the police station in the woods. Additionally, he was told that he would be beaten 
with a metal bar and that a bottle would be inserted into his anus. When he could not take it 
anymore, he tried to commit suicide by slitting his wrist and throat. For the suicide attempt he 
used a razor blade smuggled into the cell. When he was found in the morning, the Commissioner 
told him to say that he had used a piece of broken window glass because the guards would get 
into trouble for not detecting the razor blade. However, he told the doctor who sewed him what 
really happened. He also complained to the Centre of Human Rights while being detained in 
Cahul about one month ago and he was expecting an answer. He was waiting to be taken back to 
Cahul prison in order to complain again because he did not dare to while in police custody. He 
had a State appointed lawyer who he had never seen. The conditions of detention were much 
better in Cahul Prison. When he was transferred to Cahul prison he still bore marks and bruises 
of the torture. The prison doctor registered the bruises without taking any action. When he 
showed the scars of his suicide attempt to the prison staff, they asked whether he had been 
beaten so severely in Comrat that he had to slit his veins. He concluded that everyone gets beaten 
in Comrat police station. </p>

</b>39. <b>General information</b>: The prison was built in 1846 and is the oldest prison in Moldova. 
The Special Rapporteur was received by the director of the prison, Victor Petrachi. On the day of 
the visit, the pretrial penitentiary institution held a total of 931 detainees, of whom 74 were 
women and 37 (male) minors. The institution had a quarantine section and a hospital. 
66 detainees were hospitalized, of whom 25 were infected with tuberculosis; two of them were 
younger than 18. The latter were separated from adults. Furthermore, one person was being held 
in the &#8220;carcer&#8221;. Persons on hunger strike ere automatically put in isolation cells and checked by a 
doctor on a daily basis. 2 persons died in detention in 2007. The total number of staff was 243, of 
whom 88 women. The staff included 22 persons with a para-medical education. The penitentiary 
would need another 40 persons to reach the full number of staff required. One guard who had 
pushed a detainee had received an official warning, and his salary was reduced for one year. 
Upon arrival at the penitentiary institution, detainees underwent a medical examination. If a 
detainee has bruises that might result from ill-treatment or torture, a special report has to be 
submitted to the prosecutor&#8217;s office. The director observed that detainees often did not complain 
of police torture when they had bruises, but rather indicated that they had had an accident. 
In 2008, there were no explicit complaints of police torture, although the director did not 
believe that this meant that there was no torture happening in police stations. 
</p>
<p>40. Depending on the permission of a judge, detainees could receive visitors. Adults were 
allowed to walk outside in the yard one hour per day, minors two hours. In the quarantine cells, 
which had no natural light, the electricity was turned off for four hours per day, so that the 
detainees were in almost complete darkness. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the decision 
taken by the Government to close prison No. 13 and to build a new prison outside Chi&#351;in&#259;u 
instead. 
</p>
<p>41. <b>Women sector</b>:<b> </b>The female detainees reported that they had not experienced any problem 
with male officers working in the female department. Generally, they were allowed to take a 
shower once a week and go out of the cell in a small outdoor yard for two hours a day. They 
could receive a visitor once per month for one hour. Most of the women had children, some very 
young, but they had not seen them for up to several months. Many women did not even know 
where their children were. The Special Rapporteur was informed that children of female 
detainees were generally taken to orphanages. 
</p>
<p>42. <b>Veronica Codreanu</b>, aged 19, was arrested on 23 February 2008 in the street in Chi&#351;in&#259;u 
and brought to the Police Headquarters, where she was detained for one week in a cell with other 
detained female minors. During the interrogation, which lasted eight hours, she was threatened 
and told what she had to confess. She was not allowed to attend the funeral of her mother who 
died while she was in detention. The prosecutor and the State lawyer reportedly addressed her in 
an aggressive way. She alleged that the prosecutor said &#8220;I will put you in jail anyway&#8221;. After one 
week she was transferred to Penitentiary Institution No. 13. She made no allegations of 
ill-treatment within the Penitentiary Institution. </p>

<p>43. <b>E.S.</b>, aged 43, was arrested on 20 November 2007 in Chi&#351;in&#259;u. While she was in police 
custody at the Central police station, she received a small portion of food only once per day. 
During her interrogation she was subjected to psychological pressure. She was sentenced after 
spending twice 30 days in police custody, but received the verdict only in Moldovan, which she 
did not understand. She sent it back asking for translation into Russian. Regarding Penitentiary 
Institution n. 13, she was unhappy with the quality of the food and complained about lack of 
access to health care, in particular she did not get the medicine she needed against hypertension. 
</p>
<p>44. <b>Sergiu Bulgaru</b>, aged 30, was arrested together with a young woman by Ukrainian border 
guards following an Interpol search in Ukraine two years earlier. He was searched by the police 
because they suspected him of having kidnapped the young woman accompanying him and 
hiding her in his house in Tiraspol. Furthermore, he was suspected of having planned to kill her 
parents who were living in Chi&#351;in&#259;u. However, Sergiu Bulgaru denied these allegations and said 
that this story was fabricated by the Moldovan police who convinced the young woman to play 
the role of the victim. From Ukraine, he was brought to the Department for the Fight against 
Organized Crime detention centre in Tiraspol by a Moldovan police officer, Victor Alexeiov, 
and an officer of the Transnistrian militia. On that same evening he was taken to room n. 13 of 
the Department for the Fight against Organized Crime detention centre, where he was beaten on 
his chest by Viktor Alexeiov and another person for two hours in order to extort a confession. On 
the second day, he was brought again to room 13 by Viktor Alexeiov and the director of the 
Department for the Fight against Organized Crime, Eduard Mova. He was handcuffed behind his 
back and his feet were tied together behind his back with a metal wire. A metal bar similar to a 
coat hanger was passed under his arms and feet and his body was suspended in this position for 
90 minutes. It seemed to him that the metal bar had been used for the same purpose before, as 
there was a permanent fixation system on the wall. Sergiu Bulgaru lost consciousness twice. 
After having been subjected to this treatment, he confessed to what they asked him. One week 
later, he was transferred to the detention centre at Police Headquarters in Chi&#351;in&#259;u by 
Viktor Alexeiov. He was taken to room n. 5 on the second floor, where he was handcuffed 
behind his back and had his feet tied together with a wire. In this position he was suspended on a 
metal bar which was fixed between two tables. Furthermore, a dark hood was put on this head so 
that he could not see anything. Viktor Alexeiov put his foot on his back pressing his body 
towards the floor. Sergiu Bulgaru was detained in cell n. 5 of the detention centre at Police 
Headquarters in Chi&#351;in&#259;u for about a month. He had no clothes except shorts and a T-shirt and 
was therefore suffering from the cold in the cell. For this reason he started a hunger strike. The 
prosecutor told him: &#8220;We do not care about your hunger strike.&#8221; Beginning of September 2006, 
Sergiu Bulgaru was transferred to Penitentiary n. 13. The prosecutor, Ion Matusenco, came 
several times to see him in prison and threatened him in order to prevent him from complaining 
about the torture and ill-treatment he had been subjected to. He told Sergiu Bulgaru that the 
victim had connections to the Minister of Justice; so if he complained, Sergiu Bulgaru&#8217;s sister 
(resident in Bender) would get problems. Sergiu Bulgaru made no allegations of ill-treatment in 
Penitentiary n. 13, but complained about the horrible conditions of detention. Together with two 
other inmates he was detained in a small and dark cell in the basement. The very unhygienic 
shower and toilet were located in the cell. Sergiu Bulgaru was convicted to 20 years of 
imprisonment and was currently appealing the second instance decision. 
</p>
<p>45. <b>Detainee</b>, aged 26, tuberculosis section, said that he was infected with tuberculosis in the 
detention facility, like many others. He was treated with Isoniazid and Rifampin, both of which 
were not effective. The last x-ray and blood test had taken place about three months earlier. </p>

<p>46. <b>Pavel Danilescu</b>, aged 53, was arrested on 7 December 2007 and taken to Buiucani police 
station. Subsequently, he was transferred several times between the detention facilities at Police 
Headquarters and Buiucani, where he had to stay during the day. In Buiucani he was beaten and 
not given any food the whole day. A uniformed officer kicked and punched him in his back so 
that two disks of his spine were dislocated and he had hematomas on his back. He was also 
beaten on the head with a full plastic bottle. Additionally, the police officer kicked him with a 
military boot into his Achilles tendon. The ill-treatment took place in an office. He did not 
confess to anything and was taken downstairs where he was beaten again by two operative 
workers. On the fifth day he was given a lawyer who advised him to pay &#8364; 1.000 to the victims, 
which he did. He should also have paid &#8364; 1.500 to the police officer, but he refused to do so. 
After his release on 12 December he complained to the prosecutor&#8217;s, who sent him to do a 
forensic examination. However, because he could not walk, he had to wait until January before 
he could see the forensic expert. The doctor confirmed and documented that he had been beaten 
and forwarded the documentation to the prosecutor. However, the prosecutor stated that the 
evidence was not sufficient and that the case had therefore been closed. He also complained to 
the Centre for Combating Economic Crimes and Corruption. 
</p>
<p>47. <b>Grigore Dimitri Terentiev</b>, aged 32, was arrested in Cahul on 19 March 2003 at 10 p.m. 
and was taken to Cimi&#351;lia police station. On the next day he was tortured in office n. 10 and in 
the office of the deputy commissioner. First he was forced to drink vodka and then taken to a 
hospital to prove that he was drunk. He was beaten and punched with fists against his head, 
chest and abdomen for two days. On the second day he was beaten so severely that one of his 
ribs broke. Between the beatings he was taken back to his cell. The officers responsible for the 
torture were Deputy Commissioner Bu&#355;anu, Head of Criminal Investigation, Serghei Pavel 
Dodic&#225; and Criminal Investigator, Mihail Vechiu. Due to the torture he finally confessed to 
homicide. The rib was not healing well and hurt for a while. More recently it only hurt when he 
was doing sports. He complained to the prosecutor of the ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>48. <b>Vyacheslav Caraus</b>, aged 43, was arrested on 21 February 2003 in Soroka. He was 
initially detained at the Ministry of Interior&#8217;s Department for the Fight against Organized Crime, 
where he was severely ill-treated in several offices, including through beatings and electroshocks 
with the aim of obtaining information and confessions. As a result he had broken fingers and 
teeth. He had written numerous complaints to many different actors and his case had been sent 
back for re-trial. The conditions of detention in Penitentiary n. 13 were poor, mainly because of 
the over-crowding. His cell was located in the basement and was so bad that they were allowed 
additional walking time. 
</p>
<p>49. <b>Detainee</b> alleged that here was a general prohibition for detainees to talk with members of 
the &#8220;commission&#8221; who visited the penitentiary institutions every month. Before visits by 
commissioners, the inmates received a boiled egg, 50 g of butter and one potato in addition to 
their usual food. Also, walls were normally freshly painted, and one or two cells restored. 
However, the declarations made by the staff to the visitors were not followed by actions. He 
alleged that the cells in SIZO n. 13 were unhygienic without any windows and with an open 
toilet in a corner of the room. The situation was further exacerbated by the fact, that detainees 
were allowed to leave their cells for only one hour per day, which they spend in a 20 m2 yard 
surrounded by 4 m high walls. In addition, access to medicine and medical treatment was 
severely restricted and, because of lack of space, persons who were in good health were 
sometimes detained together with patients sick with tuberculosis. He himself had been held in </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/44/Add.3 
page 48 
 
</p>
<p>pretrial detention for three years, and pretrial periods were often extremely long. One of the 
things he found worst was the way of transporting detainees back and forth from the SIZO to the 
courts: 15-20 persons were forced into a 1,5m x 1,5m box fixed to a truck. Inmates violating 
prison rules were punished by detention in underground cells, called &#8220;catacomb&#8221; or &#8220;carcer&#8221;. In 
addition, violators were often subjected to punching and kicking with boots by officers from the 
&#8220;Special Force Department&#8221;. He himself was beaten six times and forced to wear a gas mask 
filled with smoke; electroshocks were applied to his genitals and legs five times. The 
ill-treatment took place in the Central police station in Chi&#351;in&#259;u, over 34 days. After that period 
he was transferred to a hospital for seven months. Within the prison colonies in Moldova there 
was a strict hierarchy between prisoners. The power was in the hands of organized criminal 
groups, with the inmates lowest in the hierarchy being obliged to do the dirty jobs in prisons, 
such as cleaning toilets etc. In Cricova colony for example, the &#8220;chiefs&#8221; had full control over the 
600 inmates working in a shoe factory within the prison and obliged them to pay 20 per cent of 
their salary to the &#8220;bank of the organized crime group&#8221;, the so-called &#8220;abchak&#8221;. In his opinion, 
the hierarchy of prisoners was inherited from the Soviet past and many suicides of prison 
inmates originated from the suffering resulting from it. Violence against detainees by police and 
prison staff was the norm rather than the exception. However, the large majority of complaints 
against police and prison officers filed with the General Prosecutor were declared ill-founded 
and dismissed - even if evidence was provided. The large amount of European Court of Human 
Rights cases under article 3 that Moldova lost had not let to any change in the situation. No 
police or prison officer had been put behind bars for having committed acts of torture. On the 
contrary, police and prison officers were often promoted. &#8220;Thousands of complaints (against 
police officers) are stuck on the desks of prosecutors who are more interested in imprisoning 
some poor boys who have stolen a mobile phone.&#8221;

<p><b>Rezina penitentiary institution No. 17 
(Visited on 8 July 2008) 
</b></p>
<p>50. <b>General information</b>: The Special Rapporteur was received by Director 
Alexandru Ceban, and one chief of bloc, Oleg Sergin Dudvic.<b> </b>On the day of the visit, there 
were 399 inmates, 85 of whom sentenced to life imprisonment. They were kept in cells with 
three other &#8220;lifers&#8221;, but they could be transferred to other cells if they wished. According to 
security rules, three senior staff members had to be present every time their cell door was 
opened. 46 detainees were held in pretrial detention; of whom two were women and three (male) 
minors. 49 persons were in the tuberculosis unit of the prison hospital. Persons sentenced to life 
or long term imprisonment were held in a special high security wing. When questioned whether 
there had been any incidents in the course of 2008, the Director told the Special Rapporteur that 
no major incidents had happened. Confronted with the findings and allegations of excessive use 
of force by prison guards in the prison hospital of 4 July 2008 collected during the visit, the 
Director said that he did not consider this a serious incident. He further explained that one of the 
guards was pushed from the back and hit with a chair on his back during a search for an illegal 
cell phone. He had to be hospitalized because of the injuries caused by this attack. The Head of 
the Security Service was reportedly also hit by a chair. This unrest, which, according to the 
Director, was confined to one room, lasted approximately one hour and was stopped with the 
help of rubber sticks by the security prison guards. The Director reportedly called the ambulance 
for the injured prison guard and notified the prosecutor. Seven detainees complained about the 
use of force and were seen by a doctor. The Director could not recall any complaints of rotten 
food as reported by the detainees. (See below an account of these events by several detainees.) </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/44/Add.3 
  page 49 
 
</p>
<p>51. The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that the incident occurred during an 
unannounced body search by the prison guards in the prison hospital. The prisoners refused to 
cooperate and tried to prevent the prison guards from removing their cellular phones which are 
prohibited in the prison. Two staff members were hit and injured by the prisoners with furniture 
items. One of them, the Deputy Chief of the Penitentiary Institution, had to be treated in hospital. 
The guards used rubber batons and handcuffs to take control over the situation. The Department 
of Penitentiary Institutions, the Ministry of Interior, as well as the Prosecutor&#8217;s office of Rezina 
District were informed of the case. Two criminal investigations were launched by the police 
regarding the incident. 
</p>
<p>52. <b>Female detainee</b>, was arrested in 2005 in Orhei. Following her arrest, she was beaten with 
fists by seven policemen for about 30 minutes. She did not have access to drinking water for the 
entire first day. She complained to her State-assigned lawyer and the prosecutor, but to no avail. 
In the prison, no female guards were present and the food was of bad quality, but otherwise she 
had no complaints. 
</p>
<p>53. <b>Minor&#8217;s cell</b>:<b> </b>Three boys of 16 years and one young adult of 18 years were held together 
in a cell. The four boys only had one bunk bed (two beds). They said that they had two bunk 
beds before, but decided to remove one of them in order to have more space in the small cell. 
The cell was furnished with a TV and DVD player, for which their families had paid. They were 
allowed to go outside for one hour in the morning and one hour in the afternoon. During these 
two hours they could mix with adult detainees. They did not experience any problems with the 
other detainees and made no allegations of ill-treatment in the penitentiary institution in Rezina. 
The four detainees had previously been held in different police stations, where the conditions 
were poor, especially the food and the low temperatures. One boy indicated that, while in police 
custody, he had had no blanket to cover himself in spite of the fact that it was winter. Another 
one said that he had been held in solitary confinement for many days in a row and saw only his 
mother and a lawyer once in a while. The boys also said that the police often does not respect the 
one hour exercise time and shortens it to ten or fifteen minutes. Some of them had also been to 
the educational colony for minors in Lipcani. 
</p>
<p>54. <b>Detainee</b>, minor, was held at Rezina police station after his arrest in May 2008 for periods 
of 10, 5 and 3 days. On the first and second days, three respectively two policemen beat him with 
fists and kicked him in his face, ribs and on his back, so that he had bruises and a swollen face. 
As a result, he partly confessed to the crime. He was not examined by a doctor and has not 
complained, but he still feels pain in his breast. He will have to go back to the same police 
station during his appeal. 
</p>
<p>55. <b>Detainee</b>, had been held in the re-education colony for minors in Lipcani for one month. 
For ten days he was locked up in the quarantine cell of the institution and was only allowed out 
for 3 times 5 minutes per day. Artificial light was switched on for 24 hours in his cell. He was 
beaten up by prison guards several times in front of other detainees. This seemed to be standard 
practice in the institution and was reportedly called &#8220;playing football&#8221; since the prison guards 
kicked the boys lying on the floor. The minors detained in Lipcani were also subjected to forced 
labour such as sweeping and washing the floor etc. If they refused to do so, they were beaten. He 
referred to the educational colony as the &#8220;school for future detainees&#8221;, where minors were 
prepared for detention rules in penitentiary institutions for adults. </p>

</p>
<p>56. <b>Grigore Irofti</b>, aged 40, was arrested on 17 March 1990 and convicted to death for 
homicide in November 1990, still under the former Soviet Union. The police had locked him into 
an iron cage resembling a safe, which they then hit with a metal object until he confessed. He 
was summarily convicted with four other persons. Until his sentence was commuted into a life 
sentence in December 1994, he spent his term in Chi&#351;in&#259;u Prison No 13 on death row. Only 
in 2002, he was transferred to Rezina prison. During the time in Penitentiary No 13 he was 
continuously locked into a basement cell without light or air. If his death sentence had been 
commuted in 1994 in accordance with the original law, which had been the basis of his 
conviction, he would have received a term not exceeding 15 years. However, a later amendment 
to the criminal code was retroactively applied and the death penalty was commuted into a life 
sentence. In general he had no complaints against the prison management of Rezina Prison and 
found it rather pleasant in comparison with Penitentiary No 13 in Chi&#351;in&#259;u. 
57. <b>Detainees (tuberculosis unit)</b> informed the Rapporteur that a few days before the visit 
they had been given rotten fish to eat. When they asked for fresh food, they were beaten up by 
the guards on 4 July 2008. The officer in charge was beating detainees with a hammer. 
Following this, a team came into the rooms with sticks and batons in order to conduct a search. 
The detainees were thrown out of their beds and beaten. The guards wore masks, so they could 
not be recognized. After the incident a doctor came to record the detainees&#8217; injuries. The 
detainees also informed the Special Rapporteur that in March one man died of tuberculosis and 
diabetes because he was not given enough medicine and was not allowed to leave the prison to 
go to hospital. 
</p>
<p>58. <b>Vosile Ivan Costiuc</b>, aged 30 years, said that, when he was sleeping in the morning of 
4 July 2008, suddenly 15 to 20 guards stormed into his room with batons and a wooden hammer. 
They tore his sheet off and threw him into the corridor outside the room where they kicked and 
beat him. The guards were also stepping on his back and leg with their boots. He was beaten 
with rubber batons and saw a guard with a wooden hammer, which, however, was not used on 
him. After the incident he asked for a doctor and the prison physician examined him and 
recorded his injuries. However, the doctor refused to hand over the document when asked for it. 
The prosecutor was notified. The day before the visit of the Special Rapporteur the 
Parliamentary Advocate came for an inspection. Mr. Costiuc could not identify the guards 
because they were wearing masks. He thought that the reason for the beatings was that the 
detainees had complained about rotten fish. He had been detained in Rezina for three years but 
had never experienced anything similar. The guards sometimes conducted searches for illegal 
objects. 
59. <b>Vitalii Pashkov</b>, aged 36, reported that he was accommodated in the room next to the 
entrance. He was among the first ones to be beaten on 4 July 2008. He was outside his room 
when guards hit him with a wooden hammer on the back of his knees so that he fell down. Two 
guards were holding his shoulders while a third one struck him with the hammer. He was also 
beaten three or four times with a baton all over his body except for his head. 
</p>
<p>60. <b>Stepan Firnachi</b> was sleeping in his room on the second floor of the building 
on 4 July 2008, when he was taken out of bed and pushed into the corridor. The guards 
shouted at him to get up because they were conducting a search. He was beaten with a baton and 
a wooden hammer on his legs, arms and back. There were many guards but only four of them 
threw him out of bed and beat him. He saw four guards with wooden hammers; the remaining </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/44/Add.3 
  page 51 
 
</p>
<p>ones used rubber batons. It was not unusual for the guards to conduct a search, but it was the first 
time that they used violence in order to clear the rooms for the search. He did not know why the 
detainees were beaten. The Deputy Director of the prison was involved in the beatings and the 
Director too saw what was happening. After the incident the Parliamentary Advocate came and 
talked to some of the detainees. He took photos of the rotten fish. Only the prison doctor 
examined the detainees and took photos of the beating marks. Mr. Firnachi has been detained in 
Rezina for two years. Some of the guards were friendly and some were not. He could go to the 
caged yard for a walk and could also receive visitors for short visits of about one hour. He was 
administered Analgin and Dimitrol. 
</p>
<p>61. The above allegations of beatings with sticks were partly confirmed by the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s forensic expert. 
</p>
<p><b>Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova 
</b></p>
<p>62. The Prison Administration informed the Special Rapporteur that there were five pre- and 
post-trial institutions in the Transnistrian Region, which covered all types of regimes from 
super-high-security to open prisons and one colony for minors. On 1 January 2008, a total of 
3487 persons were held in these institutions, up from 2533 in 1998. Persons sentenced to death 
or life-imprisonment, according to the law, have to be held in single cells all the time. They may 
receive visits (three short - up to four hours, and one long-term - up to three days per year), but 
they remain handcuffed when somebody is with them. The penitentiary system in the 
Transnistrian Region of the Republic of Moldova had been transferred from the Ministry of 
Interior to the Ministry of Justice in 2000. The salary of a prison director was about 220 USD; 
that of a guard was about 140 USD. 
</p>
<p><b>Hlinaia penitentiary institution No. 1 (Transnistria) 
(Visited on 9 July 2008) 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>General information</b>:<b> </b>The colony consists of several buildings and large cultivated fields. 
Some of the facilities are in good condition and the visiting facilities are of a high standard. The 
Special Rapporteur was received by the Director of the colony, Yuri Alexeevich Mokryak. 
Prisoners informed the Special Rapporteur that they had expected the visit for several days and 
that, in preparation of his visit, the walls had been newly painted. Prisoners had to work in the 
fields for eight hours per day. If they refused to work, they were put in the punishment cells, the 
so-called &#8220;carcer&#8221; (see also description below). 
</p>
<p>64. <b>Detainee, </b>aged 23, was arrested in Bender by the Militia on 4 September 2004. He was 
taken to a militia post. During the interrogation he was beaten with a plastic bottle filled with 
water on his head, and also on his body by several militia officers. He was held in the pretrial 
detention facility (SIZO) in Tiraspol and transferred to Hlinaia Colony No.1 after his conviction. 
On the day of the visit, he was held in a punishment cell together with two other detainees. They 
were reportedly allowed to go outdoors for one hour per day. No showers were allowed during 
detention in the punishment cell. The detainee reported that he suffered from amblyopia and was 
afraid that he would completely lose his sight while in prison since he could not get adequate 
medical treatment. The detainee did not make any allegations of ill-treatment within the colony. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/44/Add.3

</p>
<p>65. <b>Detainee</b>, aged 34, was arrested on 10 January 2008 by prison guards while working inside 
the penitentiary in the framework of a compulsory treatment against alcoholism. He received an 
eight month sentence for possession of marihuana. Since the morning of the visit he had been in 
a punishment cell because he did not stand up when prison staff went by. To his knowledge the 
guards did not beat inmates. In general he had no complaints about the food, but he had not 
received any food on the day of the visit. The medical care was not sufficient. He was told before 
that an inspection of an international organization would come for a visit and was advised not to 
complain about the prison administration but to speak solely about personal problems. However, 
he had not been threatened. 
</p>
<p><b>Investigation isolator No. 1, Hlinaia (Transnistria) 
(Visited on 9 July 2008) 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>General information</b>:<b> </b>The prison appeared clean and well kept. Persons condemned to 
death and life imprisonment were detained in a special high security unit. The medical facilities 
were deficient in terms of available medication and medical equipment. Medical registers were 
also poorly kept. The staffing level seemed to be adequate. 
</p>
<p>67. <b>Anna Koheba</b>, aged 29, and <b>Onora Kometoba</b>, aged 19, had been detained in a cell in the 
SIZO in Hlinaia together with two other women for one month. They were transferred to the 
SIZO from the women&#8217;s colony No 3 in Tiraspol as a punishment measure. Consequently, they 
were held under the strict regime, allowing them only 40 minutes outdoors per day. However, 
they reported that the conditions of detention in Hlinaia were better than those in Tiraspol. They 
did not allege any ill-treatment in the SIZO of Hlinaia. Both women had been arrested in 2005 in 
Tiraspol by the militia. In Tiraspol colony they were subjected to physical violence several 
times, mostly because they were said to have violated the rules. They were violently pushed by 
six prison officers, their arms were twisted and they were pulled by their hair. This use of force 
caused their joints to twist and led to bruises all over their bodies, which disappeared after some 
weeks. In March, they were put in the &#8220;carcer&#8221; for two months, a small, mildewed, sparely 
illuminated room with many insects in the basement of the institution. The cell was equipped 
with two iron beds but no mattresses. There was no possibility to take a shower. The bucket that 
served as toilet was inside the small room. The two women lodged a complaint with the 
penitentiary division of the so-called &#8220;Transnistrian Ministry of Justice&#8221;. However, the complaint 
did not yield any results since they were told that they had to provide evidence. 
</p>
<p>68. <b>Fiodor Negrea</b>, aged 42, sentenced to death. He was arrested in Tiraspol on 8 April 1999 
by the Special Forces of the State Security Committee (KGB) after he had surrendered. Since the 
then Minister of Interior, who knew him, was present, he was not beaten. He was kept in the 
newly built Prison No. 3 in Tiraspol until February 2000, when he was transferred for three 
months to the temporary detention isolator of the militia in Tiraspol. In May 2000, he was taken 
to the SIZO in Hlinaia, but in July 2001 he was transferred to Tiraspol Prison, where he spent 
one year in solitary confinement. In July 2002 he was transferred back to Tiraspol SIZO, where 
he was tortured at the beginning of July 2003 by Special Forces called &#8220;Skorpions&#8221;, which he 
had personally founded earlier. They damaged his spine. He was tortured because he had 
complained about his case and refused to cooperate with the prison guards. I His trial started in 
July and, on 25 July 2003, he was convicted of four cases of homicide and sentenced to death 
despite a moratorium on capital punishment dating from 1993. He had a lawyer, but she was not 
useful. He did not appeal against the judgment. He was told to ask for pardon (amnesty or </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/44/Add.3 
  page 53 
 
</p>
<p>commutation of sentence), but he refused because he had done nothing wrong. The entire trial 
was purely political. Since 26 July 2003, he had been detained in solitary confinement in Hlinaia. 
He spent 23 hours a day in his cell and one hour outside walking alone in a small yard. He never 
saw any other prisoners. Once in four months he was allowed to receive a short visit of four 
hours. In fact, the visits of his mother and brother usually did not last longer than one or two 
hours. He had a wife and three children, but he did not want his children to visit him in prison. 
He could write letters to his family. He read many books, listened to the radio and watched 
television. He had already been visited by the Council of Europe&#8217;s Committee on the Prevention 
of Torture and by another delegation consisting of two ladies. Whenever the door was opened, he 
had to wear handcuffs behind his back. He was very concerned about his political case, had 
written many complaints (e.g. to Human Rights Committee of Transnistria) and wished to submit 
a complaint to the European Court of Human Rights, but he could not afford a lawyer. Although 
he seemed to be more concerned about the political circumstances of his trial than about the 
conditions of his detention, the Special Rapporteur considers his strict solitary confinement of 
more than five years as additional punishment to his court sentence as amounting to torture. The 
effects of this treatment on his mental health were already visible. 
</p>
<p>69. <b>Vitaliy Kocherga</b>, aged 40, was sentenced to capital punishment under Article 88 of the 
Soviet Criminal Code in 1992. At that time the Code foresaw 15 years as the maximum 
punishment in case of pardon. However, when he applied for pardon after the 15 years had come 
to an end, on the basis of the new Criminal Code of the Republic of Transnistria, he was 
sentenced to life imprisonment. Mr. Kocherga argued that the retroactive use of the new Code 
with its heavier penalty constitutes a violation of Article 11 of the UDHR. He had sent 
complaints to some institutions, but never received a response. He indicated that the conditions 
in the prison had improved considerably over the last five years, e.g. he had not been allowed 
any visits at all until 2008. At times it had been very cold in his cell, but lately he had gotten 
heating. However, he spent 24 hours per day completely on his own and sometimes the prison 
administration used collective punishment, such as reduced food supply or restricted access to 
water, when other persons in the high-security regime made trouble. As in the previous case, the 
Special Rapporteur considers this prolonged solitary confinement as torture. 
</p>
<p>70. <b>Eduard Vasile Manole</b>, aged 27, and <b>Ivan Politanschii</b>, aged 27. Mr Manole was arrested 
by the Bender militia in December 2005 and spent about six weeks in the isolator in Bender, 
where he was beaten by the guards and the militia. Then he was taken to Tiraspol SIZO. After 
the first annulment of his sentence by the Supreme Court on 29 January 2007, he was threatened 
in the courtroom, his arms were twisted while he was handcuffed, and four guards beat him for 
15 minutes. Back in the SIZO, the prison doctor recorded his bruises. Although the Prison 
Director, Mr. Bessonov, asked him not to complain, he did complain to the prosecutor about the 
ill-treatment. He had been detained in Hlinaia SIZO starting from 22 May 2008. He was 
separated from all the other prisoners with the exception of his cell mate with whom he also 
spent his one hour walk outside the cell. There was a strong hierarchy among the prisoners, 
supported by the administration. He strongly complained about the fact that he had already spent 
2 &#189; years in pretrial detention. His sentences were already twice annulled by the Supreme Court, 
because all the evidence was fabricated. Although the prosecutors were responsible for 
supervising the detention facilities, it was useless to complain. Similarly, the Transnistrian 
Human Rights Commissioner was useless. </p>

<p>71. <b>Mr. Politanschii</b> was heavily beaten upon his first arrival from Dubasari to Hlinaia SIZO 
in 2004 as kind of &#8220;welcome&#8221; for five minutes until he fell down. He was taken there for the 
second time on 2 October 2007, after he had been arrested by the militia in Dubasari. He was 
threatened by two militia officers (Vasilii Gritco and Victor Zeleniac) with the arrest of his wife 
and his parents if he refused to confess, but he did not complain about any physical violence. 
When he first tried to complain to the prosecutor about these threats, the latter refused. When he 
complained again, he was told that this complaint would be attached to the case file for the court. 
</p>
<p>72. Neither of the detainees complained about ill-treatment in the SIZO. They only indicated 
that the quality of the food was not great, that water cuts were frequent, and that medical care 
was poor. Once a month they could be visited for one hour in the visitor&#8217;s room, separated from 
the visitor by a glass wall, so that they had to communicate by phone. Their main frustration 
related to the poor functioning of the judiciary, the long pretrial detention periods and the fact 
that none of their complaints seemed to go anywhere. Although the prosecutors should deal with 
their complaints, they simply referred them to the courts. 
</p>
<p>73. <b>Minors cell</b>:<b> </b>The youngest boy was 15. The shortest period one of them had spent at the 
SIZO was seven months. They had no complaints about the institution. 
</p>
<p>74. <b>Male detainee</b>, was arrested in March 2008 and beaten during custody in the militia post 
for one hour with fists on his chest and head. There was nobody he could complain to. He saw a 
judge on the fourth day, but he did not take any measures. Whereas the Prosecutor came by 
every day, he did not really control what was going on. Corruption was rampant. The worst 
experience for him had been the transfer between detention places - everybody was stuffed into 
box-like transporters with one tiny opening and essentially no ventilation and had to stay there 
for up to two or three hours. During the summer the heat in there was unbearable. That was when 
many caught tuberculosis.

<p><b>Tiraspol headquarters of the militia (Transnistria) 
(Visited on 9 July 2008) 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>General information</b>:<b> </b>The Special Rapporteur was received by the Head of the Militia 
Station, Lieutenant Colonel Yurij Ignatovich Ursul. Tiraspol Militia Station had several cells in 
the basement in which a total of 84 detainees were held on the day of the visit of the Special 
Rapporteur. 64 were held for criminal investigation; 20 persons were under arrest for 
administrative infractions. Six women were in detention. The minors were detained in different 
cells together with adults because most of them were involved in the same case. The cells, 
holding up to ten persons, were completely overcrowded, so that the detainees had to sleep in 
shifts. Ventilation was poor, the temperature very high, there were no mattresses and no natural 
light. The only source of light was a light bulb which was switched on around the clock. Toilets 
were located in the cells, but were not separated through a wall, so the detainees were completely 
deprived of their privacy. Detainees were allowed to walk outside for 10 to 15 minutes per day in 
a tiny courtyard. They were allowed to take a shower once a week. They complained about the 
very poor quality of food and the extended periods of time they had to wait for medical 
treatment. 
</p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur received a large number of allegations of torture and ill-treatment. 
Most torture and ill-treatment allegedly took place in the third floor office n. 303 of the operative </p>

</p>
<p>investigation department of the militia station. Most of the detainees spent several months in 
detention in the cells in the basement. Furthermore, on the first floor the Special Rapporteur 
found three very small cells which were too small to allow a person to lie down. A detainee was 
reportedly held there for two days. Practically all interlocutors indicated that, in their view, 
complaining is pointless because neither the medical staff nor the prosecutor nor the human 
rights commissioner will take any measures to investigate and offer redress. Complaints 
addressed to international organizations were intercepted. 
</p>
<p>77. <b>Female detainee</b>, aged 16, was arrested on 17 April 2008 in the street and taken to the 
Militia Headquarters. She immediately confessed to the crime she was accused of and was not 
threatened or ill-treated. After 13 days in the Headquarters she was taken to Tiraspol prison for 
two weeks. Then she was transferred back to the headquarters for two days and again back to the 
prison for one week. Since then she has been continuously detained at the Headquarters, where 
she sometimes shared the cell with others and sometimes was detained alone. On the day of 
the visit she had been in solitary confinement for five days. She could go outside for 10 to 
15 minutes per day. She had no complaints with regard to the food or the treatment by the 
guards. 
</p>
<p>78. <b>Eight detainees</b> informed the Special Rapporteur that in the previous week several 
detainees who bore marks of ill-treatment had been transferred from the Militia Headquarters. 
Persons were often beaten up at the time of arrest and later in an office on the third floor of the 
building to get a confession. Every detainee in the cell had been beaten or tortured at least once. 
They were hit with batons or other objects, needles were inserted under their fingernails, as 
happened to one detainee in 2002, and they were electrocuted with electric contacts on their 
fingers. The tool used for electrocutions was a small generator with a handle, which was kept in 
another place and not in the Headquarters. One of the detainees was electrocuted in the previous 
year in the Headquarters and also in another place. Others had to lie on their front with their 
hands cuffed behind their back while they were beaten on the soles of their feet with batons. 
Usually, detainees were tortured to make them sign confessions. Sometimes detainees were 
taken outside and beaten on the kidneys. A detainee reported that he was beaten so fiercely on 
the kidneys that he could not stand up for three or four days.

<p>79. <b>General information</b>: The officer in charge at the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s arrival 
was the Deputy Head of the Temporary Isolator, Mr. Anatolie Paraschiv.<b> </b>On the day of the visit 
the detention centre held 26 detainees under criminal investigation, and 18 &#8220;administrative&#8221; 
detainees. The maximum capacity of the isolator was 78. The walls of the detention facility were 
freshly painted. The cells were dark and detainees had to sleep on wooden platforms. Artificial 
light was on around the clock. The toilets were inside the cell. Detainees could spend 10 minutes 
to one hour per day in the outdoor courtyard. The detainees complained about the poor quality of 
the food. They were not allowed to receive visitors. Often detainees were taken to other police 
stations in Chi&#351;in&#259;u for investigation and interrogation. These detainees were supposed to stay in 
the other police stations only during the day and to be returned to the Central Isolator in the 
evening. However, a number of detainees reported that they had to stay in the police stations also 
overnight, where they were not provided with any food. </p>

</p>
<p>80. The Special Rapporteur paid two visits to the isolator; the first visit took place in the 
afternoon and the second in the evening. Eight detainees who were taken for interrogation to the 
police stations of Botanica, Central and Rascani during the day were transferred back to Central 
Temporary Detention Isolator in the evening. While the Special Rapporteur was generally 
welcomed in a very cooperative manner, he regrets to report that the driver of a police bus did 
not grant the Special Rapporteur access to five detainees who were held in the bus stationed in 
front of the Detention Isolator. Instead the bus with the detainees drove away pretending that the 
detainees were to be transferred to SIZO No. 13 in Chi&#351;in&#259;u. However, it was later confirmed 
that after having driven some rounds around several blocs in Chi&#351;in&#259;u, the bus drove the 
detainees back to the Central Temporary Detention Isolator. 
</p>
<p>81. <b>Valentin Cosetic</b>, aged 29, charged with drug consumption, was arrested on 1 July 2008 
and taken to a police station in Chi&#351;in&#259;u, where he was held for two days, during which he did 
not receive any food. On 3 July he was transferred to the Central Temporary Detention Isolator. 
He made no allegations of ill-treatment, but reported that the quality of the food provided was 
poor. Furthermore, he informed the Special Rapporteur that he had already been arrested in 
December 2006 and brought to the same police section in Chi&#351;in&#259;u where he was beaten until 
one of his ribs broke. 
</p>
<p>82. <b>Oleg Stanciu</b>, aged 26, was taken to Rascani police station after his arrest on 2 July 2008. 
During the transfer to the police station, he smashed the window of the police car. Pursuant to 
this incident he was locked up in one of the offices of the police station as a punishment 
measure, and four investigators kicked and punched him all over his body while he was lying on 
the floor, handcuffed with his hands behind his back. The ill-treatment lasted for three hours. He 
saw a judge three times, and each time the detention was prolonged. After two days in detention 
at Rascani police station, he was transferred to the Central Temporary Detention Isolator. Upon 
arrival at the Detention Isolator he was asked about the bruises on his body. He was afraid to 
complain about the ill-treatment since, at Rascani police station, he had been asked not to 
complain, and therefore said that the bruises resulted from a fall. The doctor who examined him 
reportedly just asked if he felt pain and, out of fear, he said that he did not feel pain. The forensic 
expert of the team of the Special Rapporteur examined him and corroborated the allegations of 
ill-treatment by medical evidence. 
</p>
<p>83. <b>Vitalii Petrov</b>, aged 41, was arrested on 30 June 2008 in Botanica by the police and 
brought to Botanica police station, where he had to stay for one day and one night. He was not 
interrogated then, but only locked up. He was not allowed to go to the toilet and was not given 
food or even water. He was not informed that he had the right to inform a lawyer. Two officers 
in civilian clothes broke his cigarettes. He refrained from protesting because he was afraid that 
he would be beaten or even killed. On 1 July he was transferred to the Central Temporary 
Detention Isolator, where he stayed for ten days in five different cells. The guards did not 
respond to any requests and he did not receive medical care. According to him, this was how it 
was done: if a detainee did not behave, he/she was taken out of the cell and beaten with rubber 
batons, as he had witnessed with five fellow detainees. Then they were put in the &#8220;carcer&#8221; where 
they had to stay for two days without any light. Two nights earlier, two detainees were beaten in 
an office of the Police Headquarters. When he was interrogated in Botanica police station on the 
day of the visit, he was insulted and threatened but not ill-treated. </p>

<p>84. <b>Radika Ursachi</b>, aged 24, had been arrested at her home one week earlier by the police. 
She was taken to the Botanica police station, where she was interrogated and had to stay 
overnight. Then she was transferred to the Central Temporary Detention Isolator. She was 
regularly transferred back to Botanica for further investigations. She had heard rumours of 
beatings but had not witnessed anything herself. 
</p>
<p>85. <b>Viktor Vasilevich Gynkota</b>, aged 44, spent six weeks at the Ryshany police station after 
his arrest. The quality of the food was poor, the medical care was insufficient, and beatings were 
used against protesters, but nothing had happened to him so far.

<p>86. <b>Antonio Morari,</b> aged 34, was arrested on 21 February 2008. He was handcuffed and, 
although he did not resist, he was beaten by the police officers and then taken to a district police 
station, where he was locked in a cell. The following day, he was interrogated by three police 
officers in an office on the first floor of the same station. During the interrogation his legs were 
fixed to a chair with a leather belt and the police officers put a gas-mask on him. He was 
handcuffed with his hands behind his back and generator cables were fixed on two of his fingers. 
He was electrocuted for three hours with some interruptions. At the same time, water was poured 
on him. Since he had already confessed to the crimes he committed, the police officers allegedly 
wanted to extort confessions of crimes other than those he had committed. He fainted twice as a 
consequence of the treatment. Bruises were visible on his back and his fingers after the 
ill-treatment, but disappeared after some weeks. To his knowledge no action was taken against 
the perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>87. <b>Vitalie Colibaba</b>, informed the Special Rapporteur about a special room in the basement 
of Buicani police station which was used to torture detainees. He himself was tortured there by 
three police officers in order to extort confessions. His hands and feet were tied together behind 
his back. A metal bar was passed under his arms and feet and fixed between two chairs so that 
his body was suspended. He was suspended in this position for 40 minutes and lost and 
consciousness three times. The police officers each time tried to make him regain consciousness 
by pouring water on him or beating his head. Furthermore, they put a jacket on his head to 
prevent him from screaming. On the same day, he was taken back to the Central Police Custody 
facility. When he was put back in the cell, he was beaten up with plastic bottles filled with water. 
Vitalie Colibaba was convicted to four years imprisonment on probation. He lodged a complaint 
to the European Court of Human Rights, which found a violation of Article 3. At Memoria 
Centre he received free medical treatment, including psychological treatment. His mother, who 
was psychologically affected by these events, also received psychological treatment. 
</p>
<p>88.  <b>Sergiu Gurgurov </b>was arrested on 25 October 2005 by six police officers vested with 
bullet proof jackets and armed with guns at his house, and taken to R&#238;scani district police in 
Chi&#351;in&#259;u. Later he was transferred to the main police commissariat in Chi&#351;in&#259;u, where he was 
interrogated in different offices on the second floor. During interrogation police officers 
ill-treated him to extort confessions. His hands and feet were tied together behind his back with a 
finger-thick textile rope. A metal bar was put under his arms and feet and fixed between two 
chairs so that his body was suspended. His hands were first wrapped with medical textile so that 
the rope did not leave any traces. Furthermore an anti-gas mask was imposed on him. Then the </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/44/Add.3 
page 58 
 
</p>
<p>police officers put two cables to his ears and electrocuted him several times. He was suspended 
for about 90 minutes. During this time he fainted several times. The police officers made him 
regain consciousness by electrocuting him and beating him on his head with plastic bottles filled 
with water. They turned around one of his fingers which had already broken before his arrest. 
Furthermore, he was beaten with palms on his ears so that he partly lost his hearing. He suspects 
that a doctor was present in the room, because somebody checked his pulse and told the police 
officers when to stop with the electroshocks. In addition, the police officers stopped his 
breathing with a gasmask, but let him breathe again when the person who he supposes to be a 
doctor told them to do so. Since he did not confess during this interrogation he was brought back 
to R&#238;scani police station, where he was left alone for the whole day and was not given any food. 
In the evening, he was transferred back to the main commissariat. He still did not confess. He 
was convicted by the court to home arrest. After the trial, police officers transferred him to the 
hospital, made the doctors issue a fake document on his state of health, and took him to the 
Department for Organized Crime where another 30 days detention were authorized. Although he 
still had difficulties walking, they forced him to sit on a chair and hit him on his body and his 
head. During these 30 day in detention, he was repeatedly taken to offices on the second and 
third floor where he was beaten with wall paper tubes and plastic bottles filled with water. As a 
consequence of the torture he had a serious trauma of the spinal bone and his legs were partly 
paralysed. At Memoria Centre, he received treatment to the extent possible. The prosecutor&#8217;s 
office explained to his lawyer that the different medical analyses did not unanimously prove that 
the injuries stem from torture. No criminal investigation and prosecution procedure were 
launched against the police officers responsible for the torture. The persons who were detained in 
the same cells in the police commissariat who saw him shortly after he was tortured refused to 
give testimony out of fear.
