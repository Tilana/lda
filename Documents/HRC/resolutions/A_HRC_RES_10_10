<p><b> Resolution 10/10.  Enforced or involuntary disappearances 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the relevant articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which protect the right to life, liberty and 
security of the person, the right not to be subjected to torture and the right to recognition as a 
person before the law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> Commission on Human Rights resolution 20 (XXXVI) of 29 February 1980, in 
which the Commission established a working group to examine questions relevant to enforced or 
involuntary disappearances, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> General Assembly resolution 47/133 of 18 December 1992, in which the 
Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance, 
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging</i> the adoption of the International Convention for the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance by the General Assembly in its resolution 61/177 of 
20 December 2006, and recognizing that its entry into force as soon as possible through its 
ratification by 20 States will be a significant event, 
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned</i> by the increasing number of cases of enforced or involuntary 
disappearances around the world, including arrest, detention and abduction, when these are part 
of or amount to enforced disappearances, and by the growing number of reports concerning 
harassment, ill-treatment and intimidation of witnesses of disappearances or relatives of persons 
who have disappeared, 
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging</i> that acts of enforced disappearance may amount to crimes against 
humanity as defined in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the importance of the right of victims to know the truth regarding the 
circumstances of the enforced disappearance, as set out in article 24 (2) and the preamble of the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, so as 
to contribute to end impunity and to promote and protect human rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the Set of Principles for the protection and promotion of human rights through 
action to combat impunity (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1997/20/Rev.1, annex II), and taking note with 
appreciation of the updated version of those principles (E/CN.4/2005/102/Add.1), 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> its resolution 7/12 of 27 March 2008, in which it extended the mandate 
of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances for a further period of 
three years, </p>

<p> </p>

pursue the fulfilment of its mandate as set out in resolution 7/12; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Calls on</i> the Governments that have not provided for a long period of time 
substantive replies concerning claims of enforced disappearances in their countries to do so and 
to give due consideration to relevant recommendations concerning this subject made by the 
Working Group in its reports; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Urges</i> States: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To promote and give full effect to the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To cooperate with the Working Group to help it to carry out its mandate effectively 
and, in that framework, give serious consideration to responding favourably to its requests for 
visits to their countries; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To prevent the occurrence of enforced disappearances, including by guaranteeing 
that any person deprived of liberty is held solely in officially recognized and supervised places of 
detention, guaranteeing access to all places of detention by authorities and institutions whose 
competence in this regard has been recognized by the concerned State, maintaining official, 
accessible, up-to-date registers and/or records of detainees, and ensuring that detainees are 
brought before a judicial authority promptly after detention; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To work to eradicate the culture of impunity for the perpetrators of enforced 
disappearances and to elucidate cases of enforced disappearances as a crucial step in effective 
prevention; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To prevent and investigate with special attention enforced disappearances of persons 
belonging to vulnerable groups, especially children, and enforced disappearances of women, as 
they may become particularly vulnerable to sexual violence and other forms of violence, and to 
bring the perpetrators of those enforced disappearances to justice; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) To take steps to provide adequate protection to witnesses of enforced or involuntary 
disappearances, human rights defenders acting against enforced disappearances, and the lawyers 
and families of disappeared persons against any intimidation, persecution, reprisals or 
ill-treatment to which they might be subjected, with special attention to women as relatives of 
disappeared persons in the context of their struggle to resolve the disappearance of members of 
their families; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Urges</i> the Governments concerned:  
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To intensify their cooperation with the Working Group on any action taken pursuant 
to recommendations addressed to them by the Working Group; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To continue their efforts to elucidate the fate of disappeared persons and to ensure 
that competent authorities in charge of investigation and prosecution are provided with adequate 
means and resources to resolve cases and bring perpetrators to justice, including after </p>

<p> 3
</p>
<p>considering establishing, where appropriate, specific judicial mechanisms or truth and 
reconciliation commissions that complement the justice system; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To make provision in their legal systems for victims of enforced or involuntary 
disappearances or their families to seek fair, prompt and adequate reparation and in addition, 
where appropriate, to consider symbolic measures recognizing the suffering of victims and 
restoring their dignity and reputation; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To address the specific needs of the families of disappeared persons; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Reminds</i> States that:  
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) As proclaimed in article 2 of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance, no State shall practise, permit or tolerate enforced disappearances; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) All acts of enforced or involuntary disappearance are crimes punishable by 
appropriate penalties, which should take due account of their extreme seriousness under criminal 
law; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) They should ensure that their competent authorities proceed immediately to conduct 
impartial inquiries in all circumstances where there is reason to believe that an enforced 
disappearance has occurred in territory under their jurisdiction; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) If such belief is borne out, all the perpetrators of enforced or involuntary 
disappearances must be brought to justice; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) Impunity is simultaneously one of the underlying causes of enforced disappearances 
and a major obstacle to the elucidation of cases thereof; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) As proclaimed in article 11 of the Declaration, all persons deprived of liberty must be 
released in a manner permitting reliable verification that they have actually been released and, 
further, have been released in conditions in which their physical integrity and ability fully to 
exercise their rights are assured; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Expresses</i>: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Its thanks to the many Governments that have cooperated with the Working Group 
and replied to its requests for information and the Governments that have accepted visits of the 
Working Group to their countries, requesting them to give all necessary attention to the Working 
Group&#8217;s recommendations and inviting them to inform the Working Group of any action that 
they take on those recommendations;

international and bilateral levels, and have developed or are developing appropriate mechanisms 
to investigate any claims of enforced disappearance that are brought to their attention, and 
encourages all the Governments concerned to expand their efforts in this area; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Invites</i> States to take legislative, administrative, legal and other steps, including when 
a state of emergency has been declared, to take action at the national and regional levels and in 
cooperation with the United Nations, if appropriate through technical assistance, and to provide 
the Working Group with concrete information on the measures taken and the obstacles </p>
