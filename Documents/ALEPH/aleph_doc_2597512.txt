UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
On June 14, 2016, Par Pacific Holdings, Inc. ("Par") entered into a unit purchase agreement (the
“Purchase Agreement”) with Black Elk Refining, LLC, to purchase all of the issued and
outstanding units representing the membership interests in Hermes Consolidated, LLC (d/b/a
Wyoming Refining Company) and indirectly Wyoming Refining Company’s wholly-owned
subsidiary, Wyoming Pipeline Company, LLC (collectively, “Wyoming Refining”) (the "WRC
Acquisition"). The WRC Acquisition closed on July 14, 2016.
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information (the “Pro Forma
Financial Information”) sets forth selected historical consolidated financial information for Par and
gives effect to the WRC Acquisition, including the financing thereof. The historical data provided
for the year ended December 31, 2015 is derived from our audited annual consolidated financial
statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015
and from the Wyoming Refining audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2015 attached as Exhibit 99.3. The historical data provided as of and for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 is derived from our unaudited interim consolidated financial
statements included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016
and the Wyoming Refining unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of June
30, 2016 and for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 attached as Exhibit 99.4.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of June 30, 2016 gives effect to
the WRC Acquisition as if it had occurred on June 30, 2016. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combined statements of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and the year ended
December 31, 2015 both give effect to the WRC Acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1,
2015. The Pro Forma Financial Information is provided for informational and illustrative purposes
only and should be read in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and
related notes in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (as
amended); our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016; and the
Wyoming Refining consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 and
six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 attached as Exhibit 99.3 and Exhibit 99.4,
respectively.
The pro forma adjustments, as described in the notes to the Pro Forma Financial Information, are
based on currently available information. The pro forma adjustments included on the pro forma
condensed combined statement of operations only include adjustments which have an ongoing
impact. We believe such adjustments are reasonable, factually supportable and directly
attributable to the events and transactions described below. The Pro Forma Financial Information
does not purport to represent what our actual consolidated results of operations or financial
position would have been had the events and transactions occurred on the dates assumed, nor is
it necessarily indicative of our future financial condition or consolidated results of operations.
The Pro Forma Financial Information gives effect to the WRC Acquisition and the financing of the
WRC Acquisition as described below:
Bridge Notes
On July 14, 2016, in connection with the WRC Acquisition, we issued approximately $52.6
million in aggregate principal amount of the “Bridge Notes” in a private offering pursuant to the
terms of a note purchase agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”) entered into among us
and the purchasers of the Bridge Notes. The net proceeds from the sale of the Bridge Notes of
$50 million were used to fund a portion of the consideration for the WRC Acquisition.
Subject to the conversion of the Bridge Notes, the entire outstanding principal balance of the
Bridge Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, will be due and payable on October 12,
2016. In the event that we have commenced, but not closed, a registered pro-rata subscription
rights offering (the “Rights Offering”) for the Company’s common stock, on or prior to October 12,
2016, the maturity date will be automatically extended to November 14, 2016.
Upon the closing of the Rights Offering and prior to the mandatory conversion of the Bridge
Notes, all of the net proceeds of the Rights Offering will first be applied to pay (i) any and all
unpaid expenses incurred by the purchasers of the Bridge Notes, (ii) all accrued and unpaid
interest on the Bridge Notes and (iii) the outstanding principal amount of the Bridge Notes.
Thereafter, to the extent not paid in cash with the net proceeds from the Rights Offering, all, but
not less than all, of the outstanding aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, on the Bridge Notes will convert into shares of the Company’s common stock.
Chambers Credit Agreement
On July 14, 2016, in connection with the WRC Acquisition, Par Wyoming Holdings, LLC, our
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a Credit Agreement with Chambers Energy
Management, LP (the “Chambers Credit Agreement”), which
provides for a single advance secured term loan to our subsidiary in the amount of $65.0 million
(the "Chambers Loan"). The proceeds of the Chambers Loan were used to pay a portion of the
consideration for the WRC Acquisition and to pay certain fees and closing costs. The Chambers
Loan matures and is fully payable on July 14, 2021 and may be prepaid, subject to the terms and
requirements set forth in the Chambers Credit Agreement.
Wyoming Refining Company Credit Facility
Wyoming Refining Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Wyoming Pipeline Company LLC,
are borrowers (the “BofA Facility Borrowers”) under a Third Amended and Restated Loan
Agreement dated as of April 30, 2015 (as amended from time to time, the “BofA Loan
Agreement”), with Bank of America, N.A., as the lender (“BofA”). The BofA Loan Agreement
remained in place following the consummation of the WRC Acquisition.
The BofA Loan Agreement provides for (a) a revolving credit facility in the maximum principal
amount at any time outstanding of $30 million, subject to a borrowing base, which provides for
revolving loans and for the issuance of letters of credit, and (b) certain term loans which are fully
advanced. Once repaid, the term loans may not be reborrowed. On July 14, 2016, the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of the term loans under the BofA Loan Agreement was
approximately $58.0 million and the aggregate outstanding principal amount of revolving loans
under the BofA Loan Agreement was approximately $10.2 million.
The Pro Forma Financial Information has been prepared using the acquisition method of
accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., whereby we
are required to record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the WRC Acquisition at their
estimated fair values as of the closing date of the WRC Acquisition. We have not yet completed
our analysis of the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities given the complexities inherent
in the valuation; therefore, the purchase price allocation used in the preparation of the unaudited
pro forma combined financial statements included herein should be considered
preliminary. Actual results could vary materially from the Pro Forma Financial Information. In
addition, the adjustments related to the WRC Acquisition do not reflect any of the synergies and
cost reductions that may result from the WRC Acquisition.

(d)
(e)
Restricted cash. Represents short-term credit support of $10 million posted by Par in
connection with the assumed debt from the Wyoming Refining acquisition.
Inventories. Represents the adjustment to reflect Wyoming Refining's inventory at its estimated
fair value. The fair value of inventory is based on the estimated quantities acquired at closing
using estimated market prices.
Property and equipment, net, Intangible assets, net, and Goodwill. The adjustment to Goodwill
of $28.1 million represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the preliminary
estimated fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We have not yet
completed our analysis of the fair value of Property and equipment, net and Intangible assets,
net related to the Wyoming Refining acquisition. The final determination of the purchase price
allocation is anticipated to be completed as soon as practicable after the close of the
acquisition. The final amounts allocated to Property and equipment, net, Intangible assets, net
and other acquired assets and liabilities related to the Wyoming Refining acquisition could
differ materially from the amounts presented in these unaudited pro forma consolidated

Notes payable. Represents new debt of $52.6 million related to the Bridge Notes less original
issue discount and deferred
financing costs of $2.7 million. Certain terms of the Bridge Notes may meet the requirements of a
beneficial conversion feature and be required to be accounted for as a component of
equity. Furthermore, additional terms of the Bridge Notes may qualify as an embedded derivative
and be required to be bifurcated and marked to market each period through earnings. We have
not yet completed the accounting analysis or valuation of these items.
(h)
(i)
(j)
Long-term debt, net of current maturities. Represents adjustments to reflect: (i) new debt of
$65.0 million related to the Chambers Loan less original issue discount and deferred financing
costs of $1.8 million and (ii) the elimination of Wyoming Refining's deferred financing costs of
$0.3 million in connection with the initial purchase price accounting adjustments.
Other accrued liabilities. Represents the adjustment to reflect Wyoming Refining's defined
benefit pension plan assets and obligation at estimated fair value. The fair value projected
benefit obligation was measured using a discount rate of 3.8% and a rate of compensation
increase of 4.0%. The fair value of plan assets was measured using an expected rate of return
of 7.0%.
Total stockholders’ equity. Represents the elimination of Wyoming Refining's historical
stockholder's equity in connection with the application of purchase accounting.
Revenues and Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation). Represents the reclassification of
Wyoming Refining's third-party pipeline costs within Cost of revenues in accordance with Par's
policy. Wyoming Refining has historically presented these costs as a reduction of Revenues.
Additionally, includes adjustments of $4.8 million and $(158) thousand for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively, to conform
Wyoming Refining's inventory accounting policy to Par's accounting policy. Wyoming Refining
uses the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") accounting method and Par uses the first-in, first-out ("FIFO")
accounting method of accounting for commodity inventories.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization. Represents an adjustment to increase Wyoming
Refining’s historical depreciation expense as a result of the fair value adjustment to Property
and equipment, net, using the straight-line method of depreciation and estimated remaining
useful life of 20 years.
Acquisition and integration expense. Represents the removal of acquisition costs that are
directly attributable to the Wyoming Refining acquisition.
Interest expense and financing costs, net. Represents interest expense and amortization of
estimated deferred financing costs associated with the following:
(k)
(l)
(m)
(n)
▪
▪
$65.0 million Chambers Loan at an interest rate of 10.5%. The Chambers Loan bears interest at
a rate equal to the greater of LIBOR or 1.0%, plus an applicable interest margin per annum of
9.5%.
$115 million principal amount of 5% Convertible Senior Notes issued in June 2016. The net
proceeds from the sale of the 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes were used to finance a portion of
the WRC Acquisition.
(o)
(p)
(q)
Represents Par's historical audited statement of operations derived from its annual report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
We do not believe there will be any income tax impact as a result of the above income
statement adjustments as any income tax expense (benefit) will be offset by changes in the
valuation allowance associated with our deferred tax asset.
Represents the estimated incremental shares to be issued upon completion of the Company's
Rights Offering and conversion of the Bridge Notes. As discussed above, the Bridge Notes are
required to be repaid from proceeds to be received from the Company's Rights Offering. To the
extent not repaid, the remaining outstanding balance of the Bridge Notes will be converted to
shares of the Company's common stock at a price of $12.25/share.
