Overview
We were incorporated as a Nevada company on April 4, 2006. We have been engaged in the 
acquisition and exploration of mineral properties since our inception. We have not generated 
any revenues and have incurred losses since inception. 
 
We currently own an option to acquire a 100% interest in the Lady Ermalina mineral 
properties, and a 100% interest in the Dome mineral properties, both located in the Province 
of British Columbia, Canada. We have conducted limited exploration work on our mineral 
properties and none of our properties has been determined to contain any mineral resources 
or reserves of any kind.

We previously owned interests in two mineral properties located in the State of Colorado, the 
High Park mineral property and the Proteus mineral property, which we transferred to a 
debenture holder in October 2009, pursuant to a settlement agreement entered in August 
2009, in settlement of amounts owing to our debenture holders. 
 
Our plan of operations for the next 12 months is to explore our mineral properties. We plan to 
begin by conducting a small exploration project on each of our properties in the next month 
involving mapping and property surveys, among other things, at a cost of approximately 
$10,000 per property. We anticipate we will require approximately $0.5 million to carry out 
any further exploration plans over the next 12 months. As at May 31, 2011, we had cash of 
$64,753 and a working capital deficit of $62,177 and will require significant financing to 
pursue our exploration plans. There can be no assurance that we will obtain the required 
financing, on terms acceptable to us or at all. In the event we are unable to obtain the 
required financing, our business may fail. An investment in our securities involves significant 
risks and you could lose your entire investment.
Development of Business
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in April 2006. In June 2007, we 
acquired the High Park mineral property through our wholly-owned subsidiary High Park 
Uranium Inc, which consisted of 29 unpatented mineral claims located in the State of 
Colorado. In January 2008, we acquired the Proteus mineral property through our wholly-
owned subsidiary Alpha Beta Uranium Inc, which consisted of 419 unpatented lode mining 
claims also located in the State of Colorado. 
 
On September 24, 2008, we entered into secured convertible debenture purchase 
agreements with three investors pursuant to which we sold three convertible debentures to 
the investors in the aggregate amount of $500,000 and we also granted to them warrants to 
purchase up to an aggregate of 12,500 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 
$40 per share exercisable for a period of two years. The debentures accrued interest at a 
rate of 10% per annum and were convertible into shares of our common stock at a price of 
$20 per share. As collateral security, we granted the investors a security interest in all the 
right, title and interest of all of our present and future assets. 
 
On June 5, 2009, we entered into agreements with the debenture holders to issue an 
aggregate of 8,455 shares of common stock to settle interest accrued up to May 31, 2009. 
On June 25, 2009, we issued an aggregate of 2,536 restricted shares of common stock to a 
debenture holder to settle interest accrued up to May 31, 2009 in the amount of $10,146. 
Subsequent to May 31, 2010, we issued a further 5,918 restricted shares of common stock to 
two debenture holders to settle interest accrued in the amount of $23,674. 
 
On August 27, 2009, we entered into a settlement agreement with one of the debenture 
holders, subsequent to an event of default under the terms of the debentures, to settle the
3
outstanding debenture in the amount of $150,000 plus accrued interest. Under the terms of 
the settlement agreement, we agreed to transfer all of our interest in our wholly-owned 
subsidiaries, Hyde Park Uranium Inc. and Alpha Beta Uranium Inc., to the debenture holder 
along with all of our property and equipment and intellectual property rights related to these 
properties. The debenture holder agreed to pay us $50,000 and had the other two 
debentures in the aggregate amount of $350,000 assigned to it.  
 
In October 2009, we completed the transfer all our interest in the High Park and Proteus 
properties to Regal Uranium pursuant to the settlement agreement. See “Management’s 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for more 
information relating to the debentures.  
 
On January 29, 2010, we entered into an option agreement (the “Lady Ermalina Option 
Agreement”) with Argus Metals Corp. (“Argus”) in relation to three mining claims known as 
the Lady Ermalina Chemainus Claims located on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, 
Canada (the “Lady Ermalina Property”). 
  
Pursuant to the Lady Ermalina Option Agreement, we agreed to issue an aggregate of 1,500 
shares of our common stock and to pay an aggregate of $5,000 in cash in consideration for 
the grant of the sole and exclusive right and option to acquire a 100% undivided interest in 
the Lady Ermalina Property. Further, we agreed to incur not less than $600,000 in 
expenditures related to exploration and development on the Lady Ermalina Property before 
January 6, 2012. We issued 250 shares to Argus under the Lady Ermalina Option Agreement 
in February 2010. 
 
On July 9, 2010, we received stockholder approval to effect a one-for-four hundred reverse 
stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock, which would take effect upon FINRA 
approval. The number of shares that we are authorized to issue did not change as a result of 
the reverse stock split.  
 
On July 22, 2010, we received approval from FINRA and the reverse stock split took effect 
on July 23, 2010.  On the effective date of the reverse split , the Company’s trading symbol 
was changed from “BUKX” to “BUKXD” for approximately 20 business days after which it 
reverted to BUKX.  
 
On August 23, 2010, 0887717 B.C. Ltd. (“0887717”), our wholly-owned subsidiary which we 
incorporated in British Columbia, Canada on August 9, 2010, entered into an option 
agreement (the “Dome Option Agreement”) with Murray Scott Morrison, pursuant to which 
0887717 had the right to acquire 100% interest in the mineral property known as the Dome 
Claim Group located on Mount Vallace in the Beaverdell Area, Greenwood Mining Division in 
the Province of British Columbia, Canada (the “Dome Property”). 
 
In accordance with the provisions of the Dome Option Agreement, 0887717 paid $5,000 to 
Mr. Morrison on the date of the agreement, is required to incur not less than $10,000 in 
expenditures related to exploration and development on the Dome Property prior to 
September 30, 2010 (incurred) and is required to pay $1,000 to Mr. Morrison on or before 
November 30, 2010(paid). Pursuant to the terms of the Dome Option Agreement, 0887717 
granted to Mr. Morrison stock options (the “Stock Options”) to purchase up to 10% of its total 
issued and outstanding share capital at a total price of $1.00, which may be exercised when 
a probable mineral reserve is discovered on the property.  The Stock Options expire 36 
months after the date of the Dome Option Agreement. 
 
In October 2010, we changed our independent auditors from Manning Elliott LLP to
4
MaloneBailey, LLP. See our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 13, 
2010 for more information. 
 
In December 2010, we completed the sale of 15,000,000 units at a price of $0.01 per unit, 
with each unit comprised of one share of common stock and one-half of one common stock 
purchase warrant, with each full warrant exercisable at a price of $0.10 per share for 12 
months, for gross proceeds of $150,000, to an investor resident in Australia that acquired the 
securities for investment purposes. This represented a change-in-control of our Company. In 
connection with the offering, we appointed Simon Eley as a director of our company. Mr. Eley 
is a director of the investor in the private placement and was appointed as a director of our 
company as a result of the investment. 
 
In December 2010, the holders of a majority of our issued and outstanding common stock 
approved an amendment to our bylaws to make them more comprehensive, as well as an 
increase in our authorized capital from 80,000,000 shares of common stock, par value 
$0.0001, to 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 to better position us to 
attract financing. The number of shares of preferred stock we are authorized to issue did not 
change as a result of the authorized capital Increase. 
 
In February 2011, we completed the sale of 35,000,000 units at a price of $0.01 per unit, with 
each unit comprised of one share of common stock and one-half of one common stock 
purchase warrant, with each full warrant exercisable at a price of $0.10 per share for 12 
months, for gross proceeds of $350,000, to certain off-shore investors that acquired the 
securities for investment purposes. 
 
In April 2011, we and Christopher Robin Relph, our President and Chief Executive Officer, 
mutually agreed to the termination of the management agreement between us and Mr. 
Relph, effective December 1, 2010 pursuant to the terms of the management agreement. 
Under the terms of the management agreement, Mr. Relph had agreed to act as our principal 
officer in consideration of a salary of $20,000 per month. We have agreed to pay Mr. Relph 
CDN$24,000 for his services for the quarter ended February 28, 2011 and to pay Mr. Relph 
CDN$8,000 per month for his services going forward. No early termination penalties were 
incurred as a result of the termination of the Management Agreement. 
 
Effective April 18, 2011, we completed the conversion of an aggregate of approximately 
$66,332 in debt owed by us to six offshore lenders into shares of our common stock at a 
price of $0.01 per share. As a result, we issued an aggregate of 6,633,200 shares of our 
common stock to the six lenders. 
 
Subsidiaries 
 
We currently have one wholly-owned subsidiary, 0887717 BC Ltd. which is incorporated 
under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada.
Competition
We are an exploration stage mineral resource exploration company that competes with other 
mineral resource exploration companies for financing and for the acquisition of new mineral 
properties.  Many of the mineral resource exploration companies with whom we compete 
have greater financial and technical resources than those available to us.  Accordingly, these 
competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisitions of mineral properties of 
merit, on exploration of their mineral properties and on development of their mineral 
properties.  In addition, they may be able to afford more geological expertise in the targeting
5
and exploration of mineral properties.  This competition could result in competitors having 
mineral properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may finance 
additional exploration and development.  This competition could adversely impact on our 
ability to achieve the financing necessary for us to conduct further exploration of our mineral 
properties.  We also compete with other mineral exploration companies for financing from a 
limited number of investors that are prepared to make investments in mineral exploration 
companies.  The presence of competing mineral exploration companies may impact on our 
ability to raise additional capital in order to fund our exploration programs if investors are of 
the view that investments in competitors are more attractive based on the merit of the 
mineral properties under investigation and the price of the investment offered to 
investors.  We also compete with other mineral companies for available resources, including, 
but not limited to, professional geologists, camp staff, mineral exploration supplies and drill 
rigs.
Intellectual Property
We currently do not own any intellectual property other than copyright in the contents of our 
website, www.buckinghamexploration.com.
Research and Development Expenditures
We have not engaged in any research and development activities since our inception.
Environmental Laws
Mineral resource exploration, production and related operations are subject to extensive 
rules and regulations of federal, provincial, state and local agencies.  Failure to comply with 
these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties.  Our cost of doing business 
may be affected by the regulatory burden on the mineral industry.  Although we intend to 
substantially comply with all applicable laws and regulations, because these rules and 
regulations frequently are amended or interpreted, we cannot predict the future cost or 
impact of complying with these laws. 
 
Environmental enforcement efforts with respect to mineral operations have increased over 
the years, and it is possible that regulations could expand and have a greater impact on 
future mineral exploration operations.  Although our management intends to comply with all 
legislation and/or actions of local, provincial, state and federal governments, non-compliance 
with applicable regulatory requirements could subject us to penalties, fines and regulatory 
actions, the costs of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and 
financial condition.  We cannot be sure that our proposed business operations will not violate 
environmental laws in the future. 
 
Our operations and properties are subject to extensive federal, state, provincial and local 
laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the generation, storage, 
handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment, and 
relating to safety and health.  These laws and regulations may (i) require the acquisition of a 
permit or other authorization before exploration commences, (ii) restrict the types, quantities 
and concentration of various substances that can be released in the environment in 
connection with exploration activities, (iii) limit or prohibit mineral exploration on certain lands 
lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas, (iv) require remedial measures 
to mitigate pollution from former operations and (v) impose substantial liabilities for pollution 
resulting from our proposed operations.
6
There are no costs to us at the present time in connection with compliance with 
environmental laws.  However, since we do anticipate engaging in natural resource projects, 
these costs could occur and any significant liability could materially adversely affect our 
business, financial condition and results of operations.
Employees
We have no part time or full time employees, other than our officers. We do not intend to hire 
any employees until our financial condition improves.
Item 1A.  Risk Factors
Not Applicable.
Item 1B.  Unresolved Staff Comments
None.
Item 2.  Properties
We lease premises, at the rate of $1,073 per month, located at Suite 418- 831 Royal Gorge 
Blvd, Cañon City, Colorado 81212, from where we oversee our business activities.  During 
the year ended May 31, 2010, we terminated a lease for an additional facility located in 
Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada.  
  
Lady Ermalina Chemainus Claims
On January 6, 2010, we entered into the Lady Ermalina Option Agreement with Argus Metals 
Corp. in relation to three mining claims known as the Lady Ermalina Chemainus Claims 
located on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada.
Location
The  Lady  Ermalina  Chemainus  group  of  claims  consists  of  approximately  550  hectares  of 
British Columbia MTO mineral claims located approximately 11 kilometres SW of Ladysmith, 
B.C.  in  the  Victoria  Mining  Division.    The  Project  covers  a  NW  trending  section  of  the  Mt. 
Sicker  formation  with  a  strong  exploration  potential  for  VMS  Copper/Lead/Zinc  deposits.  
These claims cover the old Lady A, B and C showings that were drilled for magnetite in 1953 
and host the Project’s focus the “Iron Formation 
 
Figure 1:  Location of Lady Ermalina Claims on Vancouver Island, British Columbia.

Ownership Interest
In January 2010, we entered into the Lady Ermalina Option Agreement with Argus Metals 
Corp. providing us with the option to earn a 100% interest (subject to a 2% NSR in favor of 
Argus Metals Corp.) in this project by:
  paying $5,000 on the date of execution of the agreement (completed); 
  issuing to Argus Metals Corp. a total of 1,500 common shares (250 issued and 1,250
shares to be issued on or before two years from the date of execution of the 
agreement); and
  incurring not less than $600,000 in expenditures on the property prior to January 6,
2012.
Argus Metals Corp. retains a 2.0% NSR, of which we can acquire 1.0% by making a payment 
to Argus in the sum of $1,000,000.
History of Operations
The Lady Ermalina "Iron Formation" has been re-interpreted as a possible exhalative from a 
massive  sulphide  ore  zone  at  depth,  as  is  common  in  the  New  Brunswick  camp.    The 
thickness  of  the  zone  in  the  Lady  C  area  (up  to  46  metres  thick)  in  horizontal  drill  holes 
across  the  steeply  dipping  mineralization  suggests  the  possibility  of  economic  size  to  the 
zone.    This  section  is  1.5  kilometres  NW  of,  and  on  strike  with,  the  Randy  North  Zone 
discovered  by  Laramide  Resources  Ltd.  and  five  kilometres  NW  of  the  Coronation  zone 
which  has  a  reported  resources.  These  deposits,  and  the  Mt.  Sicker  Mine  which  is  13 
kilometres SE, are all in the Paleozoic Sicker formation, of equivalent age to the Myra Falls 
formation hosting the Breakwater deposits including the large VMS high grade HW ore body 
now  operated  by  Breakwater  Resources  Ltd.  The  Lady  showing  is  easily  accessible  by 
logging roads for a drill program. 
 
The 1953 drilling program consisted of twenty AX core holes totalmg 2280.5 feet (695 m), of 
which 12 drill holes were on the Lady A, 4 on the Lady B and 4 on the Lady C showing.
8
Massive sulphide copper was produced from Mt Sicker deposits, 13km SE of the Lady 
deposit, between 1898 and 1907 when two copper smelters were in operation at Ladysmith 
and Crofton and again between 1944-45.  Laramide R sources discovered the Coronation 
Zone in 1984, which lies approximately 5 km SE of the Lady Claims.  Laramide drilled over 
200 holes and also conducted exploration work on a new discovery, the Randy North Zone, 
which lies 1.5Km SE of the Lady zone and trends on strike with the Lady C zone.
Present Condition of the Property and Current State of Exploration
To date there has been no drilling or trenching between the Lady A and Lady C showings or 
south of the Lady C to prove this continuity.  The “iron formation” consists of lenses of 
extremely fine-grained magnetite with minor specular hematite in grey chert and red 
jasperoid rock. Some pyrite is present in talus south of the Lady C zone. 
 
In 1988 a soil sampling program consisting of 871 soil samples collected at 25 and 50 meter 
intervals on lines 100 meters apart in a NE-SW orientation was conducted.  52 rock samples 
were also collected and all samples were analyzed by Acme Laboratories using 30 element 
ICP. In general the soil sampling shows moderately anomalous gold, silver, copper, lead, 
zinc and arsenic in the vicinity of the “iron formation” with a gap in the sampling where the 
topography in the vicinity of the Lady C showing was too steep.  Both soil and rock samples 
from the iron formation area were anomalous in molybdenum.   
 
A VLF-EM survey was run by Ashworth Exploration in 1987 over a southern grid with 
conductors appearing both NE and SW of the “iron formation”.  In-phase readings only were 
recorded and the power line through the property had a disruptive effect.  The magnetometer 
survey was run using a singma proton magnetometer but no base readings were taken. 
 
The magnetic profiles show strong peaks over the iron formation but again readings could 
not be taken within 200 meters of the power lines.  
 
The Project requires a detailed compilation program to bring together the entirety of the 
historic exploration work to date.  Once that has been accomplished, an on-the-ground 
property survey is required to locate the historic exploration areas drillholes.  Subsequent to 
this, a drilling program is envisioned to test the continuity of the iron formation between the 
Lady A and Lady C showings.
Geology
Regional mapping by GSC (Muller, 1980) shows the area of the Lady Claims to be underlain 
by Paleozoic Sicker Group which is intruded to the NE by the dioritic Ladysmith Stock of 
Jurassic Intrusions. The Pennsylvanian to Mississipian argillites, greywackes and cherts 
which underlie  the Property are intruded by diabase sills. The southern part of the Property 
is underlain by the Lower Devonian or older Myra Formation consisting of felsic tuff and 
breccias, argillites, rhyodacite flows and phyllites. The Iron formation strikes NW at 45 to 60 
degrees East and dips steeply with average thicknesses of 30 feet (10m) up to 160feet 
(50m).

Dome Claim Group Property
On August 23, 2010, through our wholly owned subsidiary 0887717 B.C. Ltd., we entered 
into the Dome Option Agreement, pursuant to which we have the right to acquire 100% 
interest in mining claims known as Dome Claim Group located on Mount Vallace in 
Beaverdell Area, Greenwood Mining Division in British Columbia, Canada.

Ownership Interest
On August 23, 2010, 0887717 B.C. Ltd., our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into the Dome 
Option Agreement with Murray Scott Morrison, pursuant to which 0887717 has the right to 
acquire a 100% interest in the mineral property known as the Dome Claim Group located on 
Mount Vallace in the Beaverdell Area, Greenwood Mining Division in the Province of British 
Columbia, Canada. 
 
In accordance with the provisions of the Dome Option Agreement, 0887717 paid $5,000 to 
Mr. Morrison on the date of the agreement, is required to incur not less than $10,000 in 
expenditures related to exploration and development on the Dome Property prior to 
September 30, 2010 (incurred) and is required to pay $1,000 to Mr. Morrison on or before 
November 30, 2010 (paid). Pursuant to the terms of the Dome Option Agreement, 0887717 
granted to Mr. Morrison Stock Options to purchase up to 10% of its total issued and 
outstanding share capital at a total price of $1.00, which may be exercised when a probable 
mineral reserve is discovered on the property.  The Stock Options expire 36 months after the 
date of the Dome Option Agreement.
History of Operations
The  Dome  property  is  comprised  of  sixteen  mineral  claims  covering  approximately  360 
hectares (890 acres), located  four (4) kilometreres southeast of Beaverdell, B.C. in the heart 
of the historic Beaverdell Mining Camp. The Dome mineral claims cover the historic workings 
of the Nepanee prospect that, according to the B. C. Minister of Mines Annual Reports, was 
worked intermittently between 1904 to 1935.  In more recent years, sulphide mineralization 
including  galena  and  sphalerite  has  been  located  near  the  old  workings.    The  property  is 
accessible by logging roads.
Present Condition of the Property and Current State of Exploration
No material exploration work has been carried out on the Dome Property. A sampling and 
drilling program was conducted in 1989, however the property was determined to be 
uneconomical due to the the price of gold at the time. A small mapping project was 
undertaken on the property in 2009 to prepare the ground for further work.
The property will require prospecting and geological mapping on the western edge of the 
Dome property where granodiorite is known to outcrop with concentration on known skarn 
zones and mineralized shear zones that were followed with underground workings on several 
of the old properties that lie immediately west of the Dome property.  Such old workings 
include those on District Lots 1091s, 1195s and 2939. Further mapping of the Tertiary cover 
on the eastern portion of the property will also be conducted in an attempt to determine the 
thickness of the cover.  All known historic work will be compiled into a single system at a 
scale of at least 1:2500 and cross sections prepared for selected target areas.
Regional Geology
The Dome Property lies in the western portion of the Boundary District of south 
central British Columbia and is centred within south the historic Beaverdell Mining 
Camp.  In broad terms the area is a graben-derived terrane consisting of Triassic-
Jurassic volcanics and sediments enclosed within and/or intruded by Jurassic-
Cretaceous and Tertiary granitic rocks.  Regionally, the Dome Project lies near the 
southern end of the Omineca Crystalline Belt.
12
The Boundary District is situated within the mid-Jurassic accreted Quesnellia 
terrane.  Pre-existing Proterozoic to Palaeozoic North American basement rocks do 
however exist within the rafted Quesnellia terrane (Kettle and Okanagan 
metamorphic core complexes).  During the Eocene, these core complexes were 
uplifted separated from the overlying lithologies.  The oldest of the accreted rocks 
in the district are the Pre-Jurassic Wallace Formation. 
  
Broadly speaking, the lithologies (and general ages) are broken into the 
following Formations and units:
1. Wallace Formation [Pre-Jurassic - Quesnellia Terrane]
a. Wallace Formation undivided 
b. Crouse Creek Greenstone Member 
c. Larse Creek Limestone Member
2. West Kettle batholiths [Jurassic] 
3. Various intrusive stocks [Tertiary]
a. Beaverdell stock - 58.2 ± 2 Ma 
b. Eugene Creek stock - 54.5 ± 1.9 Ma 
c. Tuzo Creek stock - 49.5 ± 2 Ma
4. Crosscutting porphyry dykes [Tertiary] 61.9 ± 2.2 Ma and
50.6 ± 1.5 Ma
Geology
Granodiorite  of  the  West  Kettle  batholith  underlies  much  of  the  area  within  and 
surrounding  the  Dome  Property.   This  batholith  has  been  repeatedly  intruded  by 
stocks of quartz monzonite (the Beaverdell stock), and hosts pendants/screens of 
metamorphosed  country  rock  (Wallace  Formation).  The  Curry-Creek  tuffs  and 
conglomerates (Oligocene age) as well as mafic Miocene flows (Nipple Mountain 
Volcanics), unconformably overlie all these units.  
In the Beaverdell Mining Camp, where the Dome Property lies, silver-lead-zinc ores 
have  predominated  historical  production.   In  order  of  historical  importance 
(production), there are two (2) distinct types of ore:
1)      the Beaverdell –Type – Silver rich Vein Deposits 
2)      The Carmi-Type Gold Rich vein deposits.
The  West  Kettle  batholith  is  intruded  by  the  Beaverdell  stock  in  the  west  of  the 
Beaverdell Camp and is overlain by Wallace Formation in the eastern portions of 
the Camp.  Mineralization occurs within structurally controlled fissure related quartz 
(+/-  carbonate)  veins  predominantly  striking  northeast.   In  order  of  decreasing 
abundance, the main metallic minerals are galena, sphalerite, pyrite, arsenopyrite, 
tetrahedrite,  pyrargyrite,  chalcopyrite,  polybasite,  acanthite,  native  silver  and 
pyrrhotite.
13
In the more northern portions of the Camp, sphalerite, pyrite and galena are the main 
minerals in the vein deposits with a gangue of quartz.
The Dome Property represents an epithermal vein (gold-silver +/- base metals) exploration 
target.  Precious metal epithermal deposit exploration techniques will be applied to 
substantiate this assessment.

Mineralization
In the Beaverdell Mining Camp silver-lead-zinc ores have predominated historical 
production.  In order of historical importance (production), there are two (2) distinct 
types of ore: 
  
      A.   Beaverdell type – Silver Rich Deposits
B.     Carmi type – Gold Rich Deposits
In the former case mineralization is typically composed of galena, sphalerite and 
pyrite  with  lesser  amounts  of  arsenopyrite,  tetrahedrite,  pyrargyrite,  chalcopyrite, 
polybasite, acanthite, native silver and pyrrhotite in a gangue of mainly quartz with 
lesser amounts of calcite and fluorite.  In the latter, roughly equivalent with native
14
gold in place of native silver.  Both these types of mineralization are noted in the 
Dome Property:
•  Beaverdell-Type silver-rich veins in the West Kettle Batholith 
•  Contact metasomatism related mineralization (within contact zone between
West Kettle Batholith and the Wallace Formation
In general the mineralization in the Beaverdell District can be described as hosted within 
granodiorite of the Westkettle batholith, grading to quartz diorite and diorites with  the 
Permian Wallace Formation metavolcanics and metasediments as roof pendants hosting the 
mineralization in the northen portions of the Property. 
 
Shear zone related mineralization is the dominant geological control on the Dome Property 
mineralization and is commonly noted on surface and underground workings in the 
Beaverdell area.  These shear zones are variable in widths from showing to showing, 
however the widths of these shear zone in the larger, well developed showings (like the Inyo-
Ackworth) average approximately two metres and are well defined by rusty fault gouge and 
vuggy quartz and manganese staining.  Lengths of these shear zones are equally as variable 
from showing to showing, with the larger more productive shear zones defined over 300 
metres in length.  The shear zones also have variable strikes however a general east-west 
(075-090 degree) trend can be estimated as the main control of Property mineraliztion.  
  
In general the shear zone related mineralization is associated with vuggy quartz-calcite 
veins, on the order of 5 to 50 centimetres wide, and commonly carry pyrite, galena, 
sphalerite, tetrahedrite and native silver mineralization.  Strong sericitic alteration and kaolin 
are known to be  associated with mineralization throughout the Property. 
  
Beaverdell silver-rich veins are found in a 3.0 by 0.8 kilometre belt, referred to as the 
Beaverdell silver-lead-zinc vein camp. The mineralized veins are fissure-hosted, formed 
along east-trending faults in the west portion of the Beaverdell camp and northeast- trending 
faults in the east portion of the camp. Faults have been classified into five types based on 
their orientation, with each type having common orientation, kind of movement and age 
relationship. The northeast-striking, high-angle normal faults pose the greatest obstacle to 
systematic exploration and mining, as these faults are commonly spaced a few metres apart 
dividing veins into short segments in a northwest-downward direction. 
  
Vein-type mineralization of the Beaverdell camp is characterized by a high silver content. 
Mineralization is composed of galena, sphalerite and pyrite with lesser amounts of 
arsenopyrite, tetrahedrite, pyrargyrite, chalcopyrite, polybasite, acanthite, native silver and 
pyrrhotite. The gangue minerals in veins are mainly quartz with lesser amounts of calcite, 
fluorite and sericite with rare barite.
Item 3.  Legal Proceedings
On August 14, 2009, Leslie Rudolph filed a Statement of Claim in the Provincial Court of 
British Columbia (Small Claims Court) to initiate a lawsuit against us. In the Statement of 
Claim, Mr. Rudolph seeks judgment for $7,833 and costs with respect to accounting services 
he provided to us from June 1, 2008 to November 30, 2008. On December 1, 2009, the 
Court issued a default order against us for the sum of $8,261 plus court order interest from 
December 30, 2008 to date. We made an application to the Court to cancel the default order, 
which was subsequently dismissed.
15
Other than as described above, we are not a party to any pending legal proceedings and are 
not aware of any legal proceedings threatened against us or to which our property is the 
subject. None of our directors, officers or affiliates: (i) are a party adverse to us in any legal 
proceedings, or (ii) have an adverse interest to us in any legal proceedings.

Item 6.  Selected Financial Data
Not applicable.
Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited 
financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report, 
as well as the section in this annual report entitled “Description of Business”.  These financial 
statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are presented in U.S. 
dollars.  
 
We are an exploration stage company with limited operations and no revenues from our 
business operations since inception in April 2006. Our auditors have issued a going concern 
opinion relating to our business which means that our auditors believe there is substantial 
doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we 
obtain additional financing to fund our operations.
18
We currently own an option to acquire a 100% interest in the Lady Ermalina mineral 
properties, and a 100% interest in the Dome mineral properties, both located in the Province 
of British Columbia, Canada, which we acquired in January and August 2010. We have 
conducted limited exploration work on these properties. We previously held interests in two 
mineral properties located in the State of Colorado which we acquired in June 2007 and 
January 2008. Pursuant to the terms of a settlement agreement entered in August 2009, we 
transferred all of our interest in these properties to a debenture holder in October 2009 in 
settlement of amounts owing by us under certain debentures upon an event of default under 
the debentures. 
 
Our plan of operations for the next 12 months is to explore our mineral properties. We plan to 
begin by conducting a small exploration project on each of our properties in the next month 
involving mapping and property surveys, among other things, at a cost of approximately 
$10,000 per property. We anticipate we will require approximately $0.5 million to carry out 
any further exploration plans over the next 12 months. As at May 31, 2011, we had cash of 
$64,753 and a working capital deficit of $62,177 and will require significant financing to 
pursue our exploration plans. There can be no assurance that we will obtain the required 
financing, on terms acceptable to us or at all. In the event we are unable to obtain the 
required financing, our business may fail. An investment in our securities involves significant 
risks and you could lose your entire investment.
Results of Operations
Lack of Revenues
We have earned no revenues and have sustained operational losses since our inception on 
April 4, 2006 to May 31, 2011. As of May 31, 2011, we had an accumulated deficit of 
$7,600,250. We anticipate that we will not earn any revenues during the current fiscal year or 
in the foreseeable future as we are an exploration stage company.
During the year ended May 31, 2009, we defaulted under three secured convertible 
debenture purchase agreements as we were unable to pay fees to maintain our interest in 
any of our 472 mineral claims located in Colorado. We entered into a settlement agreement 
on August 27, 2009 with one of our debenture holders in settlement of amounts owning 
under our convertible debentures which required the transfer of all of our interest in two 
subsidiaries and all of their assets to the debenture holder, including all mineral claims, 
intellectual property rights and property and equipment, which was completed in October 
2009.
Expenses
From April 4, 2006 (inception) to May 31, 2011, our total expenses were $2,489,797, 
comprised of $617,414 in professional fees, $21,531 in mineral property costs and 
$1,850,852 in general and administrative expenses.
Our total expenses increased to $278,821 for the year ended May 31, 2011 from $240,982 
for the year ended May 31, 2010. The increase in total expenses was due to an increase in 
costs related to obtaining financing and the acquisition of a mineral property during the 
current fiscal year, partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses 
related to our operations.
19
We recognized total other expenses of $79,964 from our inception to May 31, 2011, primarily 
due to interest expense and amounts owing under our convertible debentures. For the year 
ended May 31, 2011, we recognized total other expenses of $0, compared to $13,877 for the 
year ended May 31, 2010, due to interest expense and amounts owing under our convertible 
debentures.
Our net loss from continuing operations was $278,821 for the year ended May 31, 2011, 
compared to $254,859 for the prior period.
Loss From Discontinued Operations
We recognized a loss from discontinued operations of $0 during the year ended May 31, 
2011, compared to a loss from discontinued operations of $4,320 during the year ended May 
31, 2010, due to the transfer of all of our interest in two subsidiaries (and related assets) as a 
result of our default under our convertible debentures. See Note 9 to our audited financial 
statements included in this annual report for more information.
Net Loss
For the year ended May 31, 2011, we recognized a net loss of $278,821, compared to a net 
loss of $259,179 for the year ended May 31, 2010.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of May 31, 2011, we had cash of $64,753, a working capital deficit of $62,177, total 
assets of $71,028, total liabilities of $131,908 and an accumulated deficit of $7,600,250.
We have funded our operations primarily by a combination of private placements, advances 
from related parties and loans. From April 4, 2006 (date of inception) to May 31, 2011, 
financing activities provided cash of $4,452,620, primarily from the sale of our common 
stock. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2011, financing activities provided cash of 
$439,191, compared to $16,117 in the year ended May 31, 2010 primarily from sales of our 
common stock.
Operating activities used cash of $376,632 for the year ended May 31, 2011, compared to 
$55,466 for the year ended May 31, 2010, primarily as a result of an increased operations. 
An increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities used cash of $10,984 in the year 
ended May 31, 2011, compared to an increase in same providing cash of $201,746 in the 
prior year. Amounts due to related parties used cash of $86,146 in the current year.
Investing activities during the year ended May 31, 2011 provided cash of $0, compared to 
$38,217 in the prior year, primarily due to the disposition of our interest in our subsidiaries 
resulting from the settlement of our convertible debentures.
We expect that our total expenses will increase over the next year as we increase our 
business operations and exploration activities on our mineral properties. We do not anticipate 
generating any revenues for the foreseeable future. Our plan of operations for the next 12 
months is to explore our mineral properties. We anticipate we will require approximately $0.5 
million to carry out our exploration plans over the next 12 months and will require significant 
financing to pursue our exploration plans.
20
We  intend  to  raise  additional  capital  for  the  next  12  months  from  the  sale  of  our  equity 
securities or loans from related and other parties.  If we are unsuccessful in raising sufficient 
capital  through  such  efforts,  we  may  consider  other  financing  avenues  such  as  bank 
financing. There is no assurance that any financing will be available to us or if available, on 
terms that will be acceptable to us.  If we are unable to raise additional capital, our business 
may fail. 
 
Even though we plan to raise capital through equity or debt financing, we believe that the 
latter may not be a viable alternative for funding our operations as we do not have tangible 
assets to secure any such financing.  We anticipate that any additional funding will be in the 
form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock.  However, we do not have any 
financing  arranged  and  we  cannot  provide  any  assurance  that  we  will  be  able  to  raise 
sufficient funds from the sale of our common stock to finance our operations.  In the absence 
of such financing, we may be forced to abandon our business plan.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to 
have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of 
operations, 
to 
stockholders.

Going Concern
Our financial statements for the period ended May 31, 2011 have been prepared on a going 
concern  basis  and  Note  2  to  the  statements  identifies  issues  that  raise  substantial  doubt 
about our ability to continue as a going concern.  Our financial statements do not include any 
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 
We have not generated any revenues, have achieved losses since our inception, and rely 
upon  the  sale  of  our  common  stock  and  loans  from  related  and  other  parties  to  fund  our 
operations.  We do not anticipate generating any revenues in the foreseeable future, and if 
we are unable to raise equity or secure alternative financing, we may not be able to pursue 
our plans and our business may fail.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and 
assumptions made by management. A complete summary of these policies is included in 
Note 2 of the notes to our financial statements. We have identified below the accounting 
policies that are of particular importance in the presentation of our financial position, results 
of operations and cash flows, and which require the application of significant judgment by 
management.
Mineral Property Costs
The Company has been in the exploration stage since its inception on April 4, 2006 and has 
not  yet  realized  any  revenues  from  its  planned  operations.  It  is  primarily  engaged  in  the 
acquisition  and  exploration  of  mining  properties.  Mineral  property  exploration  costs  are 
expensed  as  incurred.  Mineral  property  acquisition  costs  are  initially  capitalized.  The 
Company assesses the carrying costs for impairment under ASC 360, Property, Plant, and
21
Equipment at each fiscal quarter end.  When it has been determined that a mineral property 
can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves, the 
costs then incurred to develop such property, are capitalized. Such costs will be amortized 
using  the  units-of-production  method  over  the  estimated  life  of  the  probable  reserve.  If 
mineral  properties  are  subsequently  abandoned  or  impaired,  any  capitalized  costs  will  be 
charged to operations.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Buckingham Exploration Inc. and its subsidiaries 
(collectively, the “Company” ) as of May 31, 2011 and the related consolidated statements of expenses, 
stockholders’ deficit and cash flows for the year then ended and the period from April 4, 2006 (inception) through 
May 31, 2011.  The financial statements for the period from April 4, 2006 (inception) through May 31, 2010 were 
audited by other auditors whose report expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.  The financial 
statements for the period from April 4, 2006 (inception) through May 31, 2010 include no revenue and an 
accumulated net loss of $7,321,429.  Our opinion on the statements of expenses, stockholder’ deficit, and cash flows 
for the year then ended , in so far as it relates to amounts for prior periods through May 31, 2010  is based solely on 
the report of the other auditor.  These financial statements are the responsibility of Buckingham Exploration Inc. 
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. 
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United 
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatements. The Company is not required to have, nor were 
we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of 
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Buckingham Exploration Inc. 
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on 
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes 
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the 
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position 
of the Company as of May 31, 2011 and their results of its operations and their cash flows for the year then ended 
and the period from inception through May 31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in 
the United States of America. 
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going 
concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses 
from operations, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans 
regarding those matters are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might 
result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Buckingham Exploration Inc. 
(An Exploration Stage Company) 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
 
1.  Nature of Operations and Continuance of Business
Buckingham  Exploration  Inc.  (the  “Company”)  was  incorporated  in  the  State  of  Nevada  on  April  4,  2006.  The 
Company is an Exploration Stage Company, as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Board 
(“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 915, Development Stage Entities. The Company’s principal 
business is the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties.  
On  August  9,  2010,  the  Company  incorporated  0887717  B.C.  Ltd.,  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  in  British 
Columbia, Canada.
2.  Going Concern
These  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on  a  going  concern  basis,  which  implies  the 
Company  will  continue  to  realize  its  assets  and  discharge  its  liabilities  in  the  normal  course  of  business.  The 
Company  has  not  generated  revenues  since  inception  and  has  not  paid  any  dividends  and  is  unlikely  to  pay 
dividends or generate earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future. The continuation of the Company as a 
going  concern  is  dependent  upon  the  continued  financial  support  from  its  shareholders,  the  ability  of  the 
Company  to  obtain  necessary  equity  financing  to  continue  operations,  and  the  attainment  of  profitable 
operations.  As  at  May  31,  2011,  the  Company  has  a  working  capital  deficit  of  $62,177  and  an  accumulated 
deficit  of  $7,600,250.  These  factors  raise  substantial  doubt  regarding  the  Company’s  ability  to  continue  as  a 
going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and 
classification  of  recorded  asset  amounts  and  classification  of  liabilities  that  might  be  necessary  should  the 
Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
As  at  May  31,  2011,  the  Company  had  $64,753  cash  in  the  bank.    The  Company  requires  a  minimum  of 
$200,000 to proceed with their plan of operations over the next twelve months.  If they achieve less than the full 
amount of financing that they require they will scale back planned exploration activities and day to day operations 
in order to reduce exploration expenses and general and administrative expenses to a level appropriate to the 
financial resources available. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise sufficient funds 
to pay the expected operating expenses for the next twelve months.
3.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
a)  Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Buckingham Exploration Inc. and its controlled 
subsidiaries. Equity investments in which we exercise significant influence, but do not control and are not the 
primary beneficiary, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Investments in which we do 
not exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. 
Intercompany transactions are eliminated
(b)  Use of Estimates
The  preparation  of  these  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting 
principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of 
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ 
from  those  estimates.  The  Company  regularly  evaluates  estimates  and  assumptions  related  to  long  lived 
assets, stock-based compensation expense, secured convertible debentures and deferred income tax asset 
allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and 
various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the 
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and 
expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company 
may  differ  materially  and  adversely  from  the  Company’s  estimates.  To  the  extent  there  are  material 
differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.
(c)  Cash and Cash Equivalents
The  Company  considers  all  highly  liquid  instruments  with  maturity  of  three  months  or  less  at  the  time  of 
issuance to be cash equivalents.

3.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
(d)  Property and Equipment
Property and equipment comprised of computer is recorded at cost and amortized over 3 years using the 
straight line method.
(e)  Basic and Diluted Net Earnings (Loss) Per Share
The  Company  computes  net  earnings  (loss)  per  share  in  accordance  with  ASC  260,  Earnings  per  Share 
which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income 
statement.    Basic  EPS  is  computed  by  dividing  net  income  (loss)  available  to  common  shareholders 
(numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted 
EPS gives  effect to all dilutive potential common shares  outstanding during the  period using the treasury 
stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing Diluted EPS, the 
average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased 
from  the  exercise  of  stock  options  or  warrants.  Diluted  EPS  excludes  all  dilutive  potential  shares  if  their 
effect is anti-dilutive. A total of 25,000,000 (2010 – 12,500) outstanding warrants have been excluded from 
the year ended May 31, 2011 and 2010 as they would be anti-dilutive.  
Components of basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended May 31, 2011 and 2010 were as 
follows:
Net loss (A)
Weighted  average  outstanding  shares  of
common stock –  
Basic (B) 
Dilutive securities - Diluted (C) 
 
Earnings per share: 
Basic (A/B) 
Diluted (A/C)

ASC 220, Comprehensive Income establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss 
and its components in the financial statements. As at May 31, 2010 and 2009 the Company has no items 
that represent a comprehensive loss and, therefore, has not included a schedule of comprehensive loss in 
the financial statements.
(g)  Mineral Property Costs
The Company has been in the exploration stage since its inception on April 4, 2006 and has not yet realized 
any revenues from its planned operations. It is primarily engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mining 
properties. Mineral property exploration costs are expensed as incurred. Mineral property acquisition costs 
are initially capitalized. The Company assesses the carrying costs for impairment under ASC 360, Property, 
Plant, and Equipment at each fiscal quarter end.  When it has been determined that a mineral property can 
be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves, the costs then incurred 
to develop such property, are capitalized. Such costs will be amortized using the units-of-production method 
over  the  estimated  life  of  the  probable  reserve.  If  mineral  properties  are  subsequently  abandoned  or 
impaired, any capitalized costs will be charged to operations.
(h)  Asset Retirement Obligations
The Company records the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability for closure and removal 
costs associated with the legal obligations upon retirement or removal of any tangible long-lived assets that 
result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of assets in accordance with ASC 
440 Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations. The initial recognition of any liability will be capitalized 
as part of the asset cost and depreciated over its estimated useful life. As at May 31, 2011 and 2010, the 
Company has not incurred any asset retirement obligations.

3.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
(i)  Long-Lived Assets
In accordance with ASC 360, Property Plant and Equipment, the Company tests long-lived assets or asset 
groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may 
not be recoverable. Circumstances  which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant 
decreases  in  the  market  price  of  the  asset;  significant  adverse  changes  in  the  business  climate  or  legal 
factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or 
construction of the asset; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a 
forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and current expectation that the asset will 
more  likely  than  not  be  sold  or  disposed  significantly  before  the  end  of  its  estimated  useful  life. 
Recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value which is generally 
determined  based  on  the  sum  of  the  undiscounted  cash  flows  expected  to  result  from  the  use  and  the 
eventual  disposal  of  the  asset,  as  well  as  specific  appraisal  in  certain  instances.  An  impairment  loss  is 
recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value.
(j)  Financial Instruments
ASC 825, Financial Instruments, requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize 
the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 825 establishes a fair value hierarchy based 
on  the  level  of  independent,  objective  evidence  surrounding  the  inputs  used  to  measure  fair  value.  A 
financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input 
that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 825 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be 
used to measure fair value:
Level 1  
Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical 
assets or liabilities.  
Level 2  
Level  2  applies  to  assets  or  liabilities  for  which  there  are  inputs  other  than  quoted  prices  that  are 
observable  for  the  asset  or  liability  such  as  quoted  prices  for  similar  assets  or  liabilities  in  active 
markets;  quoted  prices  for  identical  assets  or  liabilities  in  markets  with  insufficient  volume  or 
infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs 
are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.  
Level 3  
Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation 
methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
The Company’s financial instruments consist principally of cash, receivables, accounts payable and loans 
payable. 
 
Pursuant to ASC 825, the fair value of our cash equivalents is determined based on “Level 1” inputs, which 
consist  of  quoted  prices  in  active  markets  for  identical  assets.  The  Company  believes  that  the  recorded 
values of all of the other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature 
and respective maturity dates or durations.
(k)  Income Taxes
Potential benefits of income tax losses are not recognized in the accounts until realization is more likely than 
not.  The  Company  has  adopted  ASC  740,  Income  Taxes  as  of  its  inception.  Pursuant  to  ASC  740  the 
Company is required to compute tax asset benefits for net operating losses carried forward. The potential 
benefits  of  net  operating  losses  have  not  been  recognized  in  these  financial  statements  because  the 
Company cannot be assured it is more likely than not it will utilize the net operating losses carried forward in 
future years.

3.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
(l)  Stock-Based Compensation
The  Company  records  stock-based  compensation  in  accordance  with  ASC  718,  Compensation  –  Stock 
Based  Compensation,  and  ASC  505,  Equity  based  payments  to  non  employees,  using  the  fair  value 
method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity 
instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the 
equity instrument issued,  whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees 
and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the fair value 
of the equity instruments issued.
(m)  Foreign Currency Translation
The Company’s functional and reporting currency is the United States dollar. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated in accordance with ASC 740 Foreign Currency Translation 
Matters,  using  the  exchange  rate  prevailing  at  the  balance  sheet  date.  Gains  and  losses  arising  on 
settlement  of  foreign  currency  denominated  transactions  or  balances  are  included  in  the  determination  of 
income. Foreign currency transactions are primarily undertaken in Canadian dollars. The Company has not, 
to the date of these financials statements, entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign 
currency fluctuations.
(n)  Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact 
its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that 
have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
(o)  Reclassification
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period’s financial statements to conform to the current 
period’s presentation. 
(p)  Development stage
The Company complies with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ASC 915-15 and the Securities 
and Exchange Commission Exchange Act 7 for its characterization of the Company as development stage.
4.Mineral Property
On  August  23,  2010,  0887717  B.C.  Ltd.  a  British  Columbia  company  and  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  the 
Company, entered into an option agreement (the “Option Agreement”) with Murray Scott Morrison, pursuant to 
which  the  Company  was  granted  the  option  to  acquire  a  100%  interest  in  a  mineral  property  located  in  the 
Greenwood Mining Division, British Columbia, Canada (the “Property”). In accordance with the provisions of the 
Option Agreement, the Company exercised its option by making a payment of $5,000 on the date of execution of 
the Option Agreement, incurring not less than $10,000 in expenditures related to exploration and development 
on the Property prior to September 30, 2010 and paying a sum of $1,000 before November 30, 2010. Pursuant 
to the terms of the Option Agreement, Mr. Morrison was granted a stock option to purchase up to 10% of the 
total issued and outstanding share capital of the Company at the total price of $1.00, which may be exercised 
when a probable mineral reserve is discovered on the Property.  The Stock Option expires after 36 months from 
the date of the Option Agreement.
5.Related Party Transactions and Balances

Item 9.  Changes In and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and 
Financial Disclosure
On October 7, 2010, Manning Elliott LLP resigned as our independent registered public 
accounting firm and we appointed MaloneBailey, LLP to act as our independent auditors. 
Manning Elliott served as our independent registered public accounting firm during the past two 
fiscal years and through October 7, 2010.  
 
During the two most recent fiscal years and through October 7, 2010, there were no 
disagreements (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K) or reportable events (as 
defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K), except that our sole director and officer 
discussed with Manning Elliott the existence of material weaknesses in our internal control over 
financial reporting, as more fully described in our amended annual report on Form 10-K/A for 
the year ended May 31, 2010, filed on September 24, 2010 with the SEC. 
 
See our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 13, 2010 for more 
information.
Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
In connection with the preparation of this annual report, an evaluation was carried out by our 
management, with the participation of our sole officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure 
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)) as of May 31, 2011.  Disclosure controls and 
procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or 
submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the 
time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated 
and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
  
Based on that evaluation, and the material weaknesses outlined below under Internal Control 
Over Financial Reporting, our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer 
concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, that, due to weaknesses in 
our internal controls described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective 
in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting information required to be disclosed, within 
the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information may not be 
accumulated and communicated to our principal executive officer and principal accounting 
officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over 
financial reporting.  Under the supervision of our sole officer, the Company conducted an 
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2011 
using the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  
   
A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over 
financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the 
Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
21
basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of May 
31, 2011, the Company determined that there were significant deficiencies that constituted 
material weaknesses, as described below.  
   
1.  Certain entity level controls establishing a “tone at the top” were considered material
weaknesses. There are no segregation of duties due to the small size of the Company. 
The Company has a sole officer/director and does not have a majority of independent 
directors on its board or audit committee. The Company has no policy on fraud and no 
code of ethics at this time.
2.  All cash management is conducted by our sole officer, with may result in misappropriation
of funds.
3.  The lack of independent directors exercising an oversight role increases the risk of
management override and potential fraud.
4.  The Company is in the development stage with limited resources and limited monitoring of
internal control and assessment of risk is conducted.
Management is currently evaluating remediation plans for the above control deficiencies.  
 
In light of the existence of these control deficiencies, management concluded that there is a 
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements 
will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company’s internal controls.  
 
As a result, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal 
control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2011 based on criteria established in Internal 
Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO.
MaloneBailey LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, is not required to and has 
not issued a report concerning the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
as of May 31, 2011 pursuant to rules of the SEC.
Changes in Internal Control 
 
During the quarter ended May 31, 2011, there were no other changes in our internal control 
over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our 
internal control over financial reporting.
Item 9A(T).  Controls and Procedures
Not Applicable.
Item 9B.  Other Information

Significant Employees
Other than the officers described above, there are no other individuals that make a significant 
contribution to our business.
Family Relationships
None.
Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings
None of our directors, executive officers, promoters or control persons have been involved in 
any of the following events during the past five years:
  any bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a 
general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two 
years prior to that time;
  any conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding
(excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses);
  being subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended 
or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining, 
barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his involvement in any type of business, 
securities or banking activities; or
  being found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the SEC or the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or 
commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated.
Director Independence
We currently have two directors, none of whom is considered to be independent under 
applicable SEC rules.
Nominating Committee
Given our size and limited financial resources, we have not implemented a nominating 
committee. Our current directors consider nominations to our board. We have not implemented
24
any material changes to the procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to 
our Board of Directors during the twelve months ended May 31, 2011.
Audit Committee
On September 25, 2009, we implemented an audit committee currently comprised of our 
directors. The audit committee adopted an audit committee charter governing the duties of the 
audit committee. In accordance with the audit committee charter, our audit committee is 
responsible for: (1) the selection and oversight of our independent auditors; (2) the selection, 
evaluation and recommendation to the Board, for shareholder approval, of the auditor to 
examine our accounts, controls and financial statements; (3) recommending to the Board the 
compensation to be paid to our external auditors; (4) pre-approval of all non-audit services to be 
provided by the auditor to us or our subsidiaries; (5) oversight of the work of the auditor; (6) 
review of our audited consolidated financial statements, interim financial statements, our 
management’s discussion and analysis,  and recommendation of their approval to the Board; 
and (7) review and consideration of any significant reports and recommendations issued by our 
auditors. A copy of our audit committee charter is filed as an exhibit to this report.
Audit Committee Financial Expert
We do not have an audit committee financial expert as we believe that the cost related to 
retaining a financial expert at this time is prohibitive. Further, because we have limited 
operations at the present time, we believe the services of a financial expert are not warranted.
Code of Ethics
We have not adopted a code of ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal 
financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions 
as we currently have limited financial resources and only two directors and officers.  We plan to 
adopt a code of ethics as our business develops and we appoint additional directors and 
officers.
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Compliance Reporting
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires a company’s directors and 
officers, and persons who own more than ten-percent (10%) of the company’s common stock, to 
file with the Securities and Exchange Commission reports of ownership on Form 3 and reports 
of change in ownership on Forms 4 and 5. Such officers, directors and ten-percent stockholders 
are also required to furnish the company with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file. Based 
on information provided to us, all such reports have been filed under Section 16(a) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, however, Aviador Corporation, Simon Eley, Six Fingers Pty 
Ltd., Smart Train Australian Pty Ltd. and BC & N Pollard ATF Geovet Family Trust were late in
