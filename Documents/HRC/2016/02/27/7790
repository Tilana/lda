<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its sixteenth session from 
22 April to 3 May 2013. The review of Cuba was held at the 16th meeting on 1 May 2013. 
The delegation of Cuba was headed by Bruno Rodr&#237;guez Parilla, Minister for Foreign 
Affairs. At its 18th meeting, held on 3 May 2013, the Working Group adopted the report on 
Cuba. 
</p>
<p>2. On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Cuba: Guatemala, Montenegro and Thailand. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of

</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Germany, 
Montenegro, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Cuba through the troika. These questions

</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation of Cuba indicated that the economic, political and media blockade 
imposed by the United States of America was a mass, flagrant and systematic violation of 
human rights which caused damages, scarcities and hardships, but had not managed to 
hinder the provision of equal opportunities, the equitable distribution of wealth or the 
realization of social justice. 
</p>
<p>6. The relentless attempts by the United States to impose a &#8220;change of regime&#8221; on the 
Cuban people was a serious violation of its right to self-determination, which had failed to 
prevent the active, democratic and direct participation of its citizens in the construction of 
its constitutional order, in the decisions adopted by its Government and in the election of its 
authorities. 
</p>
<p>7. Cuba was a State where there had not been a single extrajudicial execution, and 
where there were no tortured or disappeared persons. 
</p>
<p>8. The national report was the result of a broad and participatory process of 
consultations which had involved several governmental institutions, the Parliament, several 
civil society organizations and other relevant institutions. 
</p>
<p>9. Significant economic and social changes had taken place since the first presentation 
by Cuba before the UPR mechanism in 2009. The country had moved forward in the 
process of institutional development; Cuba had continued to improve citizens&#8217; participation </p>


<p>and control as the fundamental basis of its democracy and had upheld efforts to achieve 
sustainable development with social justice. 
</p>
<p>10. Cuba remained committed to its unshakeable determination to move forward with its 
socialist, autochthonous, original, democratic and openly participatory development. 
</p>
<p>11. Cuba had not come to the session to declare that its work had been completed. 
Neither did Cuba accept the existence of a unique or universal democracy model, much less 
the imposition of the political system of the western industrialized countries. 
</p>
<p>12. One of the most transcendental developments that had occurred since the previous 
session was the adoption by the National Assembly of People&#8217;s Power of the Guidelines for 
the Economic and Social Policy of Cuba, which were a set of essential decisions aimed at 
the updating of the Cuban economic and social model as well as the programme of the 
Government. 
</p>
<p>13. The system for the legal protection of human rights in Cuba was not confined to a 
description in the Constitution. Human rights were duly developed and guaranteed in other 
substantive and procedural provisions in force, in accordance with the rights enshrined in 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and all other international human rights 
instruments. 
</p>
<p>14. The right to free universal education and health was guaranteed to everyone. The 
rights to life, liberty and security of persons were based on the principle of respect for 
human dignity and were the fundamental pillars in all the actions taken by the Cuban 
authorities and the functioning of the entire society. 
</p>
<p>15. Five Cuban anti-terrorists who were suffering an unjust and prolonged incarceration 
in the United States were deprived of every protection. Their legal defence had been 
hindered, they had been subject to cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment and several of 
them had not been allowed visits from their relatives. 
</p>
<p>16. Cuba recognized, respected and guaranteed religious liberty without any 
discrimination whatsoever. All citizens&#8217; rights to freedoms of opinion, expression, 
information and press were recognized. 
</p>
<p>17. The democratization of the Internet was urgently needed, as was the transfer of 
resources and suitable technologies for social communication. 
</p>
<p>18. Between 2010 and 2013 the United States had allocated $191.7 million for the 
funding of organizations and &#8220;hirelings&#8221;, the use of information technologies for subversive 
purposes and illegal radio and television broadcasts intended to bring about a change of 
regime in Cuba. 
</p>
<p>19. In Cuba equality and non-discrimination were fully guaranteed. The Government of 
Cuba continued to implement a series of laws, policies and programmes aimed at upholding 
those principles. 
</p>
<p>20. Institutional racism had been eradicated. Cuba was proud of its African heritage. 
Recently, a decision had been taken to appoint one Vice-President of the Council of State to 
follow up and monitor the struggle against racism and racial discrimination. Similarly, the 
First Vice-President of the Council of State and of Ministers had been invested with powers 
to protect and oversee the exercise of children&#8217;s rights.  
</p>
<p>21. The struggle against discrimination based on sexual orientation was another area in 
which Cuba had recorded sustained progress. 
</p>
<p>22. The penitentiary system in Cuba was based on the principle of human development. 
Cuba abided by all the precepts contained in the Standard Minimum Rules for the </p>


<p>Treatment of Prisoners and prioritized the preventive approach through a number of social 
programmes. 
</p>
<p>23. Through a number of cooperation programmes, Cuba also contributed to the 
exercise and attainment of human rights of other peoples of the world. 
</p>
<p>24. Cuba maintained a high level of cooperation and interaction with the procedures and 
mechanisms of the United Nations system in the area of human rights, which were 
implemented universally and on a non-discriminatory basis. 
</p>
<p>25. Cuba had always expressed its unequivocal willingness to establish a dialogue on 
every issue and with all States on the basis of mutual respect, sovereign equality and the 
recognition of the right to self-determination. 
</p>
<p>26. Cuba was open to a constructive and respectful dialogue. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>27. During the interactive dialogue, 132 delegations made statements.
