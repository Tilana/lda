10-Q
This CREDIT AGREEMENT, dated as of December 15, 2014, is among CHESAPEAKE ENERGY CORPORATION, an Oklahoma corporation (together
with its permitted successors, the “Borrower”), the banks, financial institutions and other lending institutions from time to time parties as lenders hereto (each
a “Lender” and, collectively, the “Lenders”), MUFG UNION BANK, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and each Swingline Lender and Letter of Credit Issuer from
time to time party hereto.
WHEREAS, the Borrower has requested that the Lenders extend credit to it from time to time subject to the terms of this Agreement; and
WHEREAS, the Lenders, the Swingline Lenders and the Letter of Credit Issuers are willing to make available to the Borrower such credit upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
ARTICLE I
DEFINITIONS
1.1 Defined Terms.
(a) Terms defined in the preamble have the meaning ascribed to them in the preamble.
(b) As used herein, the following terms shall have the meanings specified in this Section 1.1 unless the context otherwise requires (it being understood that
defined terms in this Agreement shall include in the singular number the plural and in the plural the singular):
“ABR” shall mean for any day a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus  1⁄2 of 1%, (b) the rate of interest
in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by the Administrative Agent as its “prime rate” and (c) the LIBOR Rate for a one-month Interest
Period on such day (or if such day is not a Business Day, the immediately preceding Business Day) plus 1.0%; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, for
purposes of calculating the LIBOR Rate pursuant to clause (c) above, the LIBOR Rate for any day shall be based on the rate per annum determined by the
Administrative Agent at approximately 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such day by reference to the rate appearing on the Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page (or
any successor page or any successor service, or any substitute page or substitute for such service, providing rate quotations comparable to the Reuters
Screen LIBOR01 Page, as determined by the Administrative Agent from time to time for purposes of providing quotations of interest rates applicable to dollar
deposits in the London interbank market) for a period equal to one-month and such rate shall in no event be less than zero for the purposes of this
Agreement. The “prime rate” is a rate set by the Administrative Agent based upon various factors, including the Administrative Agent’s costs and desired
return, general economic conditions and other factors, and is used as a reference point for pricing some loans, which may be priced at, above, or below such
announced rate. Any change in the ABR due to a change in such rate announced by the Administrative Agent, in the Federal Funds Effective Rate or in the
one-month LIBOR Rate shall take effect at the opening of business on the day specified in the public announcement of such change.
[CREDIT AGREEMENT]
10-Q
“ABR Loan” shall mean each Loan bearing interest based on the ABR.
“Additional Lender” shall have the meaning provided in Section 2.17(a).
“Adjusted Consolidated Net Tangible Assets” shall mean (without duplication), as of the date of determination, (a) the sum of (i) discounted future net
revenue from proved oil and gas reserves of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries calculated in accordance with SEC guidelines before any state or federal
income taxes, as estimated by petroleum engineers (which may include the Borrower’s internal engineers) in a reserve report prepared as of the end of the
Borrower’s most recently completed fiscal year, as increased by, as of the date of determination, the discounted future net revenue of (A) estimated proved oil
and gas reserves of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries attributable to any acquisition consummated since the date of such year-end reserve report, and
(B) estimated proved oil and gas reserves of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries attributable to extensions, discoveries and other additions and upward
revisions of estimates of proved oil and gas reserves due to exploration, development or exploitation, production or other activities conducted or otherwise
occurring since the date of such year-end reserve report, which, in the case of clauses (A) and (B), would, in accordance with standard industry practice,
result in such increases as calculated in accordance with SEC guidelines (utilizing the prices utilized in such year-end reserve report), and decreased by, as
of the date of determination, the discounted future net revenue of (C) estimated proved oil and gas reserves of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries produced or
disposed of since the date of such year-end reserve report and (D) reductions in the estimated oil and gas reserves of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
since the date of such year-end reserve report attributable to downward revisions of estimates of proved oil and gas reserves due to exploration,
development or exploitation, production or other activities conducted or otherwise occurring since the date of such year-end reserve report which, in the case
of clauses (C) and (D), would, in accordance with standard industry practice, result in such decreases as calculated in accordance with SEC guidelines
(utilizing the prices utilized in such year-end reserve report); provided that, in the case of each of the determinations made pursuant to clauses (A) through
(D), such increases and decreases may be estimated by the Borrower’s engineers, (ii) the capitalized costs that are attributable to oil and gas properties of
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to which no proved oil and gas reserves are attributable, based on the Borrower’s books and records as of a date no earlier
than the date of the Borrower’s latest annual or quarterly financial statements, (iii) the Net Working Capital on a date no earlier than the date of the Borrower’s
latest annual or quarterly financial statements and (iv) the greater of (I) the net book value on a date no earlier than the date of the Borrower’s latest annual or
quarterly financial statements and (II) the appraised value, as estimated by independent appraisers, of other tangible assets (including Investments in
unconsolidated Subsidiaries) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, as of a date no earlier than the date of the Borrower’s latest audited financial statements,
minus (b) the sum of (i) minority interests, (ii) any gas balancing liabilities of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries reflected as a long-term liability in the
Borrower’s latest annual or quarterly financial statements, (iii) the discounted future net revenue, calculated in accordance with SEC guidelines (utilizing the
prices utilized in the Borrower’s year-end reserve report), attributable to reserves which are required to be delivered to third parties to fully satisfy the
obligations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries with respect to VPPs on the schedules specified

Borrower and its Subsidiaries with respect to Dollar-Denominated Production Payments on the schedules specified with respect thereto and (v) the
discounted future net revenue, calculated in accordance with SEC guidelines (utilizing the same prices utilized in the Borrower’s year-end reserve report),
attributable to reserves subject to participation interests, overriding royalty interests or other interests of third parties, pursuant to participation, partnership,
vendor financing or other agreements then in effect, or which otherwise are required to be delivered to third parties. If the Borrower changes its method of
accounting from the full cost method to the successful efforts method or a similar method of accounting, Adjusted Consolidated Net Tangible Assets will
continue to be calculated as if the Borrower were still using the full cost method of accounting. As used in this definition, “Net Working Capital” means (i) all
current assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, minus (ii) all current liabilities of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, except current liabilities included in

direction of the management and policies of such other Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise. “Controlling”
(“controlling”) and “controlled” shall have meanings correlative thereto.

For purposes hereof, (a) if either S&P or Moody’s shall not have in effect an Applicable Rating (other than by reason of the circumstances referred to in the
next succeeding paragraph), then the applicable Pricing Level will be based on the single available Applicable Rating, (b) if the Applicable Ratings
established by S&P and Moody’s shall fall within different Pricing Levels, the applicable Pricing Level shall be based on the higher of the two Applicable
Ratings unless one of the two ratings is two or more Pricing Levels lower than the other, in which case the applicable Pricing Level shall be determined by
reference to the Pricing Level one rating lower than the higher of the two Applicable Ratings, and (c) if the Applicable Ratings established by S&P and

Administrative Agent. Each change in the applicable rate shall apply during the period commencing on the effective date of such change and ending on the
day immediately preceding the effective date of the next such change.
If the rating system of S&P or Moody’s shall change, or if either such rating agency shall cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations, the
Borrower and the Lenders shall negotiate in good faith to amend this definition to reflect such changed rating system or the unavailability of ratings from such
rating agency and, pending the effectiveness of any such amendment, the Applicable Margin with respect to LIBOR Loans and ABR Loans and the
Commitment Fee Rate shall be determined by reference to the rating most recently in effect prior to such change or cessation.

Refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such Refinancing would cause the applicable Dollar-denominated restriction to be
exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such Refinancing, such Dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed

respect to determining whether any Indebtedness or Investment may be incurred or Disposition, Restricted Payment or payment under Section 10.7 may be
made at any time under such Sections. For purposes of Section 10.11, amounts in currencies other than Dollars shall be translated into Dollars at the
applicable exchange rates used in preparing the most recently delivered financial statements pursuant to Section 9.1(a) or (b). Notwithstanding

exchange rate).

with the Borrower’s consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) to appropriately reflect a change in currency of any country and any relevant
market conventions or practices relating to such change in currency.

of (a) 5 Business Days after such Swingline Loan is initially borrowed and (b) the Maturity Date. The Borrower shall not use the proceeds of any Swingline
Loan to refinance a Swingline Loan. Promptly upon request therefor as provided below, each Lender shall fund to the Swingline Lenders an amount equal to
the product of such Lender’s Commitment Percentage times the amount of such Swingline Loan. No Swingline Lender shall make any Swingline Loan after
receiving a written notice from the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any Lender stating that an Event of Default exists and is continuing until such time
as the Swingline Lenders shall have received written notice of (i) rescission of all such notices from the party or parties originally delivering such notice or
(ii) the waiver of such Event of Default in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.1.
(c) On any Business Day, the Swingline Lenders may, in their sole discretion, give notice to each Lender that all then-outstanding Swingline Loans of such

notwithstanding (i) that the amount of the Mandatory Borrowing may not comply with the minimum amount for each Borrowing specified in Section 2.2,
(ii) whether any conditions specified in Article VII are then satisfied, (iii) whether a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (iv) the date
of such Mandatory Borrowing, or (v) any reduction in the Total Commitment after any such Swingline Loans were made. In the event that, in the sole
judgment of any Swingline Lender, any Mandatory Borrowing cannot for any reason be made on the date otherwise required above (including as a result of
the commencement of a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code in respect of the Borrower), each Lender hereby agrees that it shall forthwith purchase, at
par, from such Swingline Lender (without recourse or warranty) such participation of the outstanding Swingline Loans as shall be necessary to cause the
Lenders to share in such Swingline Loans ratably based upon their respective Commitment Percentages, provided that all principal and interest payable on
such Swingline Loans shall be for the account of such Swingline Lender until the date the respective participation is purchased and, to the extent attributable
to the purchased participation, shall be payable to such Lender purchasing same from and after such date of purchase.

Swingline Loans shall be in a minimum amount of at least $1,000,000 and in a multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (except for any Borrowing in an
aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused balance of aggregate Commitments), provided that Loans made to reimburse the Letter of Credit Issuer

Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent’s Office, (i) prior to 1:00 p.m. at least three Business Days’ prior written notice (or telephonic notice promptly
confirmed in writing) of each Borrowing of Loans if such Loans are to be initially LIBOR Loans (or prior to 1:00 p.m. two Business Days’ prior written notice in

writing) prior to 1:00 p.m. on the date of each Borrowing of Loans that are to be ABR Loans. Such notice (together with each notice of a Borrowing of
Swingline Loans pursuant to Section 2.3(b), a “Notice of Borrowing”) shall specify (A) the aggregate principal amount of the Loans to be made pursuant to
such Borrowing, (B) the date of the Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day) and (C) whether the respective Borrowing shall consist of ABR Loans and/or
LIBOR Loans and, if LIBOR Loans, the Interest Period to be initially applicable thereto (if no Interest Period is selected, the Borrower shall be deemed to

promptly confirmed in writing) of each proposed Borrowing, of such Lender’s Commitment Percentage thereof and of the other matters covered by the related
Notice of Borrowing.
(b) Whenever the Borrower desires to incur Swingline Loans hereunder, it shall give the Administrative Agent and each Swingline Lender written notice (or
telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of each borrowing of Swingline Loans prior to 3:00 p.m. Central time on the date of such borrowing. Each
such notice shall specify (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Swingline Loans to be made pursuant to such borrowing and (iii) the date of borrowing
(which shall be a Business Day).
(c) Mandatory Borrowings shall be made upon the notice specified in Section 2.1(c), with the Borrower irrevocably agreeing, by its incurrence of any
Swingline Loan, to the making of Mandatory Borrowings as set forth in such Section.

(e) Without in any way limiting the obligation of the Borrower to confirm in writing any notice it may give hereunder by telephone, the Administrative Agent
may act prior to receipt of written confirmation without liability upon the basis of such telephonic notice believed by the Administrative Agent in good faith to
be from an Authorized Officer of the Borrower or other representative of the Borrower duly authorized by an Authorized Officer.
2.4 Disbursement of Funds.
(a) No later than 1:00 p.m. on the date specified in each Notice of Borrowing (including Mandatory Borrowings), each Lender will make available its pro rata
portion of each Borrowing requested to be made on such date in the manner provided below; provided that on the Closing Date, such funds shall be made
available by 10:00 a.m. or such earlier time as may be agreed among the Lenders, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent for the purpose of
consummating the Transactions; provided further that all Swingline Loans shall be made available in the full amount thereof by the Swingline Lenders no
later than 4:30 p.m. on the date requested.
(b) Each Lender shall make available all amounts it is to fund to the Borrower under any Borrowing in immediately available funds to the Administrative

Unpaid Drawings) make available to the Borrower, by depositing or wiring to an account as designated by the Borrower in the Notice of Borrowing to the
Administrative Agent the aggregate of the amounts so made available in Dollars. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Lender
prior to the date of any such Borrowing that such Lender does not intend to make available to the Administrative Agent its portion of the Borrowing or
Borrowings to be made on such date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent
on such date of Borrowing, and the Administrative Agent, in reliance upon such assumption, may (in its sole discretion and without any obligation to do so)
make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such
Lender and the Administrative Agent has made available such amount to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such
corresponding amount from such Lender. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent’s demand therefor
the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent
in Dollars. The Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover from such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, interest on such corresponding
amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such
corresponding amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to (i) if paid by such Lender, the Overnight Rate or (ii) if paid by
the Borrower, the then-applicable rate of interest or fees, calculated in accordance with Section 2.8, for the respective Loans.
(c) Nothing in this Section 2.4 shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its commitments hereunder or to prejudice any rights that the
Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder (it being understood, however, that no Lender shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Lender to fulfill its commitments hereunder).

2.5 Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.
(a) The Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the applicable Lenders, on the Maturity Date, the then outstanding
principal amount of all Loans. The repayment of Swingline Loans shall be governed by Section 2.1(b).
(b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to the appropriate
lending office of such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such lending office from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable
and paid to such lending office from time to time under this Agreement.
(c) The Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Borrower, shall maintain the Register pursuant to Section 13.6(b), and a subaccount for each Lender, in which
Register and subaccounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the amount of each Loan and each Swingline Loan made hereunder, the Type of each Loan
made and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower
to each Lender or the Swingline Lenders hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower and
each Lender’s share thereof.
(d) The entries made in the Register and accounts and subaccounts maintained pursuant to clauses (b) and (c) of this Section 2.5 shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of the Borrower therein recorded;
provided, however, that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such account, such Register or such subaccount, as applicable, or
any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay (with applicable interest) the Loans made to the Borrower by such
Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
(e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note substantially in the form of Exhibit I hereto. In such event, the Borrower
shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its
registered assigns). Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to
Section 13.6) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered
note, to such payee and its registered assigns).
2.6 Conversions and Continuations.
(a) Subject to the penultimate sentence of this clause (a), (i) the Borrower shall have the option on any Business Day to convert all or a portion equal to at
least $1,000,000 (and in multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof) of the outstanding principal amount of Loans of one Type into a Borrowing or Borrowings of
another Type and (ii) the Borrower shall have the
 
42
[CREDIT AGREEMENT]
10-Q
option on any Business Day to continue the outstanding principal amount of any LIBOR Loans as LIBOR Loans for an additional Interest Period; provided
that (A) no partial conversion of LIBOR Loans shall reduce the outstanding principal amount of LIBOR Loans made pursuant to a single Borrowing to less
than $1,000,000, (B) ABR Loans may not be converted into LIBOR Loans if an Event of Default is in existence on the date of the conversion and the
Administrative Agent has or the Majority Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such conversion, (C) LIBOR Loans may not be
continued as LIBOR Loans for an additional Interest Period if an Event of Default is in existence on the date of the proposed continuation and the
Administrative Agent has or the Majority Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such continuation, and (D) Borrowings resulting
from conversions pursuant to this Section 2.6 shall be limited in number as provided in Section 2.2. Each such conversion or continuation shall be effected
by the Borrower by giving the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent’s Office prior to 1:00 p.m. at least (1) three Business Days’, in the case of a
continuation of or conversion to LIBOR Loans or (2) the date of conversion, in the case of a conversion into ABR Loans, prior written notice (or telephonic
notice promptly confirmed in writing) (each, a “Notice of Conversion or Continuation”) specifying the Loans to be so converted or continued, the Type of
Loans to be converted into or continued and, if such Loans are to be converted into or continued as LIBOR Loans, the Interest Period to be initially applicable
thereto (if no Interest Period is selected, the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration). The Administrative
Agent shall give each applicable Lender notice as promptly as practicable of any such proposed conversion or continuation affecting any of its Loans.
(b) If any Event of Default is in existence at the time of any proposed continuation of any LIBOR Loans and the Administrative Agent has or the Majority
Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such continuation, such LIBOR Loans shall be automatically converted on the last day of
the current Interest Period into ABR Loans. If upon the expiration of any Interest Period in respect of LIBOR Loans, the Borrower has failed to elect a new
Interest Period to be applicable thereto as provided in clause (a) above, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to convert such Borrowing of LIBOR
Loans into a Borrowing of ABR Loans, effective as of the expiration date of such current Interest Period.
2.7 Pro Rata Borrowings. Each Borrowing of Loans under this Agreement shall be made by the Lenders pro rata on the basis of their then applicable
Commitment Percentages. It is understood that (a) no Lender shall be responsible for any default by any other Lender in its obligation to make Loans
hereunder and that each Lender severally but not jointly shall be obligated to make the Loans provided to be made by it hereunder, regardless of the failure
of any other Lender to fulfill its commitments hereunder and (b) failure by a Lender to perform any of its obligations under any of the Credit Documents shall
not release any Person from performance of its obligation under any Credit Document. Each Borrowing of Swingline Loans under this Agreement shall be
made by the Swingline Lenders pro rata on the basis of their then applicable Swingline Subcommitments. It is understood that (a) no Swingline Lender shall
be responsible for any default by any other Swingline Lender in its obligation to make Swingline Loans hereunder and that each Swingline Lender severally
but not jointly shall be obligated to make the Swingline Loans provided to be made by it hereunder, regardless of the failure of any other Swingline Lender to
fulfill its commitments hereunder and (b) failure by a Swingline Lender to
perform any of its obligations under any of the Credit Documents shall not release any Person from performance of its obligation under any Credit Document.

2.8 Interest.
(a) The unpaid principal amount of each ABR Loan shall bear interest from the date of the Borrowing thereof until maturity (whether by acceleration or
otherwise) at a rate per annum that shall at all times be the Applicable Margin plus the ABR, in each case, in effect from time to time.
(b) The unpaid principal amount of each LIBOR Loan shall bear interest from the date of the Borrowing thereof until maturity thereof (whether by acceleration
or otherwise) at a rate per annum that shall at all times be the Applicable Margin plus the relevant LIBOR Rate, in each case, in effect from time to time.
(c) The unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan shall bear interest from the date of the borrowing thereof until maturity thereof (whether by
acceleration or otherwise) at a per annum rate equal to the rate for overnight (next business day) Dollar deposits in the interbank eurodollar market as
determined by the applicable Swingline Lender plus the Applicable Margin with respect to LIBOR Loans.
(d) If all or a portion of (i) the principal amount of any Loan or (ii) any interest payable thereon shall not be paid when due (whether at stated maturity, by
acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum that is (the “Default Rate”) (A) in the case of overdue principal, the
rate that would otherwise be applicable thereto plus 2% or (B) in the case of any overdue interest, to the extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law,
the rate described in Section 2.8(a) plus 2% from the date of such non-payment to the date on which such amount is paid in full (after as well as before
judgment).
(e) Interest on each Loan shall accrue from and including the date of any Borrowing to but excluding the date of any repayment thereof and shall be payable
in Dollars; provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same date on which it is made shall bear interest for one day. Except as provided below, interest shall
be payable (i) in respect of each Swingline Loan, on the maturity date thereof, (ii) in respect of each ABR Loan, quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day
of each March, June, September and December, (iii) in respect of each LIBOR Loan, on the last day of each Interest Period applicable thereto and, in the
case of an Interest Period in excess of three months, on each date occurring at three-month intervals after the first day of such Interest Period, and (iv) in
respect of each Loan, (A) on any prepayment (on the amount prepaid), (B) at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) and (C) after such maturity, on
demand.
(f) All computations of interest hereunder shall be made in accordance with Section 5.5.

2.9 Interest Periods. At the time the Borrower gives a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion or Continuation in respect of the making of, or conversion
into or continuation as, a Borrowing of LIBOR Loans in accordance with Section 2.6(a), the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent written notice (or
telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of the Interest Period applicable to such Borrowing, which Interest Period shall, at the option of the Borrower
be a period of (i) one week or any other period between one week and one month if an Interpolated Rate may be determined with respect to such other
period, (ii) one month or two, three or six months or (iii) if available to all the Lenders making such LIBOR Loans, a 12-month or any other period requested
by the Borrower.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above:
(a) the initial Interest Period for any Borrowing of LIBOR Loans shall commence on the date of such Borrowing (including the date of any conversion from a
Borrowing of ABR Loans) and each Interest Period occurring thereafter in respect of such Borrowing shall commence on the day on which the next
preceding Interest Period expires;
(b) if any Interest Period relating to a Borrowing of LIBOR Loans begins on the last Business Day of a calendar month or begins on a day for which there is
no numerically corresponding day in the calendar month at the end of such Interest Period, such Interest Period shall end on the last Business Day of the
calendar month at the end of such Interest Period;
(c) if any Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall expire on the next succeeding Business Day;
provided that, if any Interest Period in respect of a LIBOR Loan would otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business Day, but is a day of the month after
which no further Business Day occurs in such month, such Interest Period shall expire on the next preceding Business Day; and
(d) the Borrower shall not be entitled to elect any Interest Period in respect of any LIBOR Loan if such Interest Period would extend beyond the Maturity Date.
2.10 Increased Costs, Illegality, Etc.
(a) In the event that (x) in the case of clause (i) below, the Majority Lenders or (y) in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) below, any Lender, shall have reasonably
determined (which determination shall, absent clearly demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto):
(i) on any date for determining the LIBOR Rate for any Interest Period that (A) deposits in the principal amounts of the Loans comprising such LIBOR
Borrowing are not generally available in the relevant market, (B) by reason of any changes arising on or after the Closing Date affecting the interbank LIBOR
market, adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable interest rate on the basis provided for in the definition of LIBOR Rate, or (C) the
LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such
Borrowing for such Interest Period; or
 
45
[CREDIT AGREEMENT]
10-Q
(ii) that, due to a Change in Law occurring at any time or after the Closing Date, which Change in Law shall (A) impose, modify or deem applicable any
reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended
by, any Lender, (B) subject any Lender to any Tax with respect to any Credit Document or any LIBOR Loan made by it (other than (i) Taxes indemnifiable
under Section 5.4, or (ii) Excluded Taxes), or (C) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this
Agreement or LIBOR Loans made by such Lender, which results in the cost to such Lender of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining LIBOR
Loans or participating in Letters of Credit (in each case hereunder) increasing by an amount which such Lender reasonably deems material or the amounts
received or receivable by such Lender hereunder with respect to the foregoing shall be reduced; or
(iii) at any time, that the making or continuance of any LIBOR Loan has become unlawful as a result of compliance by such Lender in good faith with any
Requirement of Law (or would conflict with any such Requirement of Law not having the force of law even though the failure to comply therewith would not
be unlawful);
then, and in any such event, such Lenders (or the Administrative Agent, in the case of clause (i) above) shall within a reasonable time thereafter give notice
(if by telephone, confirmed in writing) to the Borrower and to the Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice the Administrative Agent shall
promptly transmit to each of the other Lenders). Thereafter (x) in the case of clause (i) above, LIBOR Loans shall no longer be available until such time as the
Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice by the Administrative Agent no longer exist
(which notice the Administrative Agent agrees to give at such time when such circumstances no longer exist), and any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of
Conversion given by the Borrower with respect to LIBOR Loans that have not yet been incurred shall be deemed rescinded by the Borrower, (y) in the case
of clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender, promptly (but no later than 15 Business Days) after receipt of written demand therefor such
additional amounts as shall be required to compensate such Lender for such increased costs or reductions in amounts receivable hereunder (it being agreed
that a written notice as to the additional amounts owed to such Lender, showing in reasonable detail the basis for the calculation thereof, submitted to the
Borrower by such Lender shall, absent clearly demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) and (z) in the case of clause
(iii) above, the Borrower shall take one of the actions specified in Section 2.10(b) as promptly as possible and, in any event, within the time period required
by applicable Requirements of Law.
(b) At any time that any LIBOR Loan is affected by the circumstances described in Section 2.10(a)(ii) or (iii), the Borrower may (and in the case of a LIBOR
Loan affected pursuant to Section 2.10(a)(iii) shall) either (i) if the affected LIBOR Loan has been requested but not yet made, cancel such Borrowing request
by giving the Administrative Agent telephonic notice (confirmed promptly in writing) thereof on the same date that the Borrower was notified by a Lender
pursuant to Section 2.10(a)(ii) or (iii) or (ii) if the affected LIBOR Loan is then outstanding, upon at least three Business Days’ notice to the Administrative
Agent, require the affected Lender to convert each such LIBOR Loan into an ABR Loan; provided that if more than one Lender is affected at any time, then all
affected Lenders must be treated in the same manner pursuant to this Section 2.10(b).

(c) If, after the Closing Date, any Change in Law relating to capital adequacy or liquidity requirements of any Lender or compliance by any Lender or its
parent with any Change in Law relating to capital adequacy or liquidity requirements occurring after the Closing Date, has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or its parent’s capital or assets as a consequence of such Lender’s commitments or obligations hereunder to a
level below that which such Lender or its parent could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s or its parent’s
policies with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity requirements), then from time to time, promptly (but in any event no later than 15 Business Days) after
written demand by such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Lender or its parent for such reduction, it being understood and agreed, however, that a Lender shall not be entitled to such compensation
as a result of such Lender’s compliance with, or pursuant to any request or directive to comply with, any applicable Requirement of Law as in effect on the
Closing Date (except as otherwise set forth in the definition of Change in Law). Each Lender, upon determining in good faith that any additional amounts will
be payable pursuant to this Section 2.10(c), will give prompt written notice thereof to the Borrower, which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis
of the calculation of such additional amounts, although the failure to give any such notice shall not, subject to Section 2.13, release or diminish the
Borrower’s obligations to pay additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.10(c) upon receipt of such notice.
2.11 Compensation. If (a) any payment of principal of any LIBOR Loan is made by the Borrower to or for the account of a Lender other than on the last day of
the Interest Period for such LIBOR Loan as a result of a payment or conversion pursuant to Sections 2.5, 2.6, 2.10, 5.1, 5.2 or 13.7, as a result of acceleration
of the maturity of the Loans pursuant to Article XI or for any other reason, (b) any Borrowing of LIBOR Loans is not made on the date specified in a Notice of
Borrowing, (c) any ABR Loan is not converted into a LIBOR Loan on the date specified in a Notice of Conversion or Continuation, (d) any LIBOR Loan is not
continued as a LIBOR Loan on the date specified in a Notice of Conversion or Continuation or (e) any prepayment of principal of any LIBOR Loan is not
made as a result of a withdrawn notice of prepayment pursuant to Section 5.1 or 5.2, the Borrower shall after the Borrower’s receipt of a written request by
such Lender (which request shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such amount and shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of
manifest error), pay to the Administrative Agent (within 15 Business Days) for the account of such Lender any amounts required to compensate such Lender
for any additional losses, costs or expenses that such Lender may reasonably incur as a result of such payment, failure to convert, failure to continue or
failure to prepay, including any loss, cost or expense (excluding loss of anticipated profits) actually incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of
deposits or other funds acquired by any Lender to fund or maintain such LIBOR Loan.
2.12 Change of Lending Office. Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.10(a)(ii), 2.10(a)(iii),
2.10(c), 3.5 or 5.4 with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such
Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans
 
47

10-Q
affected by such event; provided that such designation is made on such terms that such Lender and its lending office suffer no economic, legal or regulatory
disadvantage, with the object of avoiding the consequence of the event giving rise to the operation of any such Section. Nothing in this Section 2.12 shall
affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the right of any Lender provided in Section 2.10, 3.5 or 5.4.
2.13 Notice of Certain Costs. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent any notice required by Section 2.10, 2.11, 3.5 or 5.4 is
given by any Lender, any Letter of Credit Issuer or any L/C Participant, as the case may be, more than 180 days after such Person has knowledge (or should
have had knowledge) of the occurrence of the event giving rise to the additional cost, reduction in amounts, loss, tax or other additional amounts described in
such Sections, such Person shall not be entitled to compensation under Section 2.10, 2.11, 3.5 or 5.4, as the case may be, for any such amounts incurred or
accruing prior to the 181st day prior to the giving of such notice to the Borrower; provided that if the circumstance giving rise to such claim is retroactive, then
such 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
2.14 Borrowing Base and PV-9 Determination.
(a) Borrowing Base. During a Borrowing Base Trigger Period, the Facility shall be subject to a Borrowing Base.
(b) Scheduled and Interim Redeterminations. During a Borrowing Base Trigger Period, the Borrowing Base shall be redetermined annually and the PV-9
shall be determined semi-annually in accordance with this Section 2.14 (a “Scheduled Redetermination”) and such redetermined Borrowing Base or PV-9,
as applicable, shall become effective and applicable to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Letter of Credit Issuers and the Lenders within forty-five
(45) days (or as promptly thereafter as practicable) after the delivery of each Engineering Report. In addition, following the First Scheduled Redetermination
Date, the Borrower may, by notifying the Administrative Agent thereof and the Administrative Agent, acting at the direction of the Majority Lenders may, by
notifying the Borrower thereof, elect to cause the Borrowing Base or PV-9 to be redetermined between Scheduled Redeterminations (an “Interim
Redetermination”), in each case, not more than once between Scheduled Redeterminations, in accordance with this Section 2.14.
(c) Scheduled and Interim Redetermination Procedure.
(i) Each Scheduled Redetermination and each Interim Redetermination shall be effectuated as follows: Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of (A) the
Reserve Report, and (B) such other reports, data and supplemental information as may, from time to time, be reasonably requested by, or provided by the
Borrower to, the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Required Lenders (the Reserve Report and such other reports, data and supplemental information,
including the information provided pursuant to Section 9.13 being the “Engineering Reports”), the Administrative Agent shall evaluate the information
contained in the Engineering Reports and shall in good faith propose a new Borrowing Base (the “Proposed Borrowing Base”) or PV-9 (the “Proposed PV-
9”) as applicable based upon such information and such other information (including the status of title information
 
48
[CREDIT AGREEMENT]
10-Q
with respect to the Borrowing Base Properties as described in the Engineering Reports and the existence of any other Indebtedness) as the Administrative
Agent deems appropriate in good faith in accordance with its usual and customary oil and gas lending criteria as they exist at the particular time (provided
that notwithstanding such criteria, Proved Non-Producing Reserves and Proved Undeveloped Reserves (in the aggregate) may have an aggregate value in
the Borrowing Base of up to 35% of the Borrowing Base).
(ii) The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the Proposed Borrowing Base or the Proposed PV-9, as applicable (the “Proposed
Determination Notice”) within fifteen (15) days after the Administrative Agent has received the required Engineering Reports.
(iii) (A) Any Proposed Borrowing Base that would increase the Borrowing Base then in effect must be approved or deemed to have been approved by the
Borrowing Base Required Lenders, (B) any Proposed Borrowing Base that would decrease or maintain the Borrowing Base then in effect must be approved
or be deemed to have been approved by the Required Lenders, and (C) any Proposed PV-9 must be approved or be deemed to have been approved by the
Majority Lenders, in each case, as determined in each such Lender’s sole discretion and in good faith, consistent with each such Lender’s usual and
customary oil and gas lending criteria as they exist at the particular time as provided in this Section 2.14(c)(iii). Upon receipt of the Proposed Determination
Notice, each Lender shall have fifteen (15) days to agree with the Proposed Borrowing Base or PV-9, as applicable, or disagree with the Proposed
Borrowing Base or PV-9, as applicable, by proposing an alternate Borrowing Base or PV-9, as applicable. If at the end of such 15-day period, any Lender
has not communicated its approval or disapproval in writing to the Administrative Agent, such silence shall be deemed to be an approval of the Proposed
Borrowing Base or PV-9, as applicable. If, at the end of such 15-day period, the Borrowing Base Required Lenders, in the case of a Proposed Borrowing
Base that would increase the Borrowing Base then in effect, the Required Lenders, in the case of a Proposed Borrowing Base that would decrease or
maintain the Borrowing Base then in effect, or in the case of a Proposed PV-9, the Majority Lenders have approved or deemed to have approved, as
aforesaid, then the Proposed Borrowing Base or PV-9, as the case may be, shall become the new Borrowing Base or PV-9, as applicable, effective on the
date specified in Section 2.14(d). If, however, at the end of such 15-day period, the Borrowing Base Required Lenders, the Required Lenders, or Majority
Lenders, as applicable, have not approved or deemed to have approved, as aforesaid, then the Administrative Agent shall promptly thereafter poll the
Lenders to ascertain the highest (i) Borrowing Base then acceptable to the Borrowing Base Required Lenders (in the case of any increase to the Borrowing
Base) or a number of Lenders sufficient to constitute the Required Lenders (in any other case) and such amount shall become the new Borrowing Base,
effective on the date specified in Section 2.14(d) or (ii) PV-9 then acceptable to a number of Lenders sufficient to constitute the Majority Lenders and such
amount shall become the new PV-9, effective on the date specified in Section 2.14(d). It is expressly understood that the Administrative Agent and Lenders
have no obligation to designate the Borrowing Base or PV-9 at any particular amount, except in the good faith exercise of their discretion, whether in relation
to the Total Commitment, the Maximum Aggregate Amount or otherwise.

(d) Effectiveness of a Redetermined Borrowing Base and PV-9. After a redetermined Borrowing Base or PV-9 is approved or is deemed to have been
approved by the Borrowing Base Required Lenders, the Required Lenders or the Majority Lenders, as applicable, pursuant to Section 2.14(c)(iii), the
Administrative Agent shall promptly thereafter notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the amount of the redetermined Borrowing Base or PV-9, as the case
may be (the “New Determination Notice”), and such amount, subject to Section 2.14(e), shall become the new Borrowing Base or PV-9, as applicable,
effective and applicable to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Letter of Credit Issuers and the Lenders:
(i) in the case of a Scheduled Redetermination, (A) if the Administrative Agent shall have received the Engineering Reports required to be delivered by the
Borrower pursuant to Sections 9.13(a) and (b) in a timely and complete manner, then (x) in the case of the Borrowing Base, on June 15th, and (y) in the case
of PV-9, on June 15th and October 30th following such notice, or (B) if the Administrative Agent shall not have received the Engineering Reports required to
be delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Sections 9.13(a) and (b) in a timely and complete manner, then on the Business Day next succeeding delivery of
such New Determination Notice; and
(ii) in the case of an Interim Redetermination, on the Business Day next succeeding delivery of such New Determination Notice (each a “Determination
Date”).
Subject to Section 2.14(e), such amount shall then become the Borrowing Base or PV-9, as the case may be, until the next Scheduled Redetermination Date
or the next Interim Redetermination Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Scheduled Redetermination or Interim Redetermination shall become effective
until the New Determination Notice related thereto is received by the Borrower.
(e) Borrower’s Right to Elect Reduced Borrowing Base. Within three Business Days of its receipt of a New Determination Notice, the Borrower may provide
written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders that specifies for the period from the effective date of the New Determination Notice until the next
succeeding Scheduled Redetermination Date, the Borrowing Base will be a lesser amount than the amount set forth in such New Determination Notice,
whereupon such specified lesser amount will become the new Borrowing Base. The Borrower’s notice under this Section 2.14(e) shall be irrevocable, but
without prejudice to its rights to initiate Interim Redeterminations.
(f) [Reserved].
(g) Administrative Agent Data. The Administrative Agent hereby agrees to provide an updated Bank Price Deck to the Borrower (i) promptly, and in any event
within three (3) Business Days, after the Administrative Agent’s request for an Interim Redetermination, (ii) promptly, and in any event within three
(3) Business Days, upon any request of the Borrower, (iii) promptly, and in any event within three (3) Business Days of the occurrence of a Borrowing Base
Trigger Event, and (iv) reasonably promptly after the Administrative Agent becoming aware of any change to the Bank Price Deck from the version most
recently delivered to the Borrower. In addition, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agree, upon request, to meet with the Borrower to discuss their
evaluation of the reservoir engineering of the Oil and Gas Properties included in any Reserve Report and their respective methodologies for valuing such
properties and the other factors considered in calculating the Borrowing Base.

[CREDIT AGREEMENT]
10-Q
(h) Unsecured Period. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, during any Unsecured Period, the provisions of Section 2.14(a) through
(g) and (i) will be deemed to be inapplicable and shall be disregarded for all purposes. Within 45 days after the delivery of an Internal Reserve Report
delivered pursuant to Section 9.13(c), or as soon thereafter as practicable (such date the “Initial Determination Date”), the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent shall propose, and the Borrowing Base Increase Lenders shall approve, the PV-9 and initial Borrowing Base.
(i) Substitute Collateral. During a Borrowing Base Trigger Period, the Borrower shall be entitled (at its own cost and expense) at any time and from time to
time to mortgage and grant to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders additional Collateral in substitution for any part of the then-existing
Collateral, provided that: (i) no Default then exists or would result from such release and substitution, (ii) immediately after giving effect thereto, the Collateral
Coverage Ratio is not less than the Minimum Collateral Coverage Ratio and (iii) for any new Collateral to be granted or pledged by the Borrower, the
Borrower shall have taken the related actions and made the deliveries required under Section 9.12; and (iv) after giving effect to such substitution, the
Collateral being substituted would not cause the value of all substituted and released Collateral substituted or released since the most recent Determination
Date to be in excess of 33% of the PV-9 (as of the most recent PV-9 Determination Date), as determined, in the case of any substitution of less than or equal
to 10% of the PV-9, by the Administrative Agent or as determined, in the case of any substitution of more than 10% but less than 33% of the PV-9, collectively
by the Administrative Agent and at least one other Agent Bank. A substitution of Collateral with a value less than 100% of the value of the Collateral that has
been released will be treated as both a release and substitution for purposes of the calculations in this Section 2.14(i) and in Section 2.14(j), as applicable,
and the conditions and requirements in each of such Sections shall be satisfied in respect of each such substitution. Upon request, Collateral may be
released and/or exchanged for substitute Oil and Gas Property Collateral without the need for a new PV-9 determination, so long as (i) the Minimum
Collateral Coverage Ratio and the Collateral Requirements are maintained, as determined as set forth herein, with respect to any new Oil and Gas Property
Collateral given in exchange for released Collateral and (ii) the aggregate value of all released and substituted collateral since the most recent PV-9
Determination Date is less than 33% of such PV-9.
(j) Collateral Releases. Upon written request by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall execute releases in the form
provided to it by the Borrower and acceptable to the Administrative Agent at the cost and expense of the Borrower thereby releasing one or more properties
from the Lien of the Mortgages in accordance with the terms set forth herein and therein, provided in each case that: (i) immediately after giving effect thereto,
the Collateral Coverage Ratio is not less than the Minimum Collateral Coverage Ratio, (ii) no Default or Event of Default exists or would exist immediately
after giving effect to such release, and (iii) if after giving effect to such release, the Collateral being released would not cause the value of all released and
substituted Collateral released or substituted since the most recent PV-9 Determination Date to be in excess of 33% of the PV-9 (as of the most recent PV-9
Determination Date), as determined, in the case of any release or
 
51
[CREDIT AGREEMENT]
10-Q
substitution of less than or equal to 10% of the PV-9, by the Administrative Agent or as determined, in the case of any release or substitution of more than
10% but less than 33% of the PV-9, collectively by the Administrative Agent and at least one other Agent Bank.
2.15 Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following
provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
(a) Commitment Fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 4.1(a);
(b) The Commitment and the Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders, the Majority Lenders, the
Required Lenders or Borrowing Base Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver
pursuant to Section 13.1); provided that (i) any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders pursuant to Section 13.1 (other than
Section 13.1(b)(x) or requiring the consent of each affected Lender pursuant to Section 13.1(b)(i) or (ix) or, shall require the consent of such Defaulting
Lender (which for the avoidance of doubt would include any change to the Maturity Date applicable to such Defaulting Lender, decreasing or forgiving any
principal or interest due to such Defaulting Lender, any decrease of any interest rate applicable to Loans made by such Defaulting Lender (other than the
waiving of post-default interest rates) and any increase in such Defaulting Lender’s Commitment) and (ii) any redetermination, whether an increase,
decrease or affirmation, of the Borrowing Base shall occur without the participation of a Defaulting Lender;
(c) If any Swingline Exposure or Letter of Credit Exposure exists at the time a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then (i) all or any part of such Swingline
Exposure and Letter of Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender will, subject to the limitation in the first proviso below, automatically be reallocated
(effective on the day such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender) among the Non-Defaulting Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective
Commitment Percentages; provided that (A) each Non-Defaulting Lender’s Exposure may not in any event exceed the Commitment Percentage of the Loan
Limit of such Non-Defaulting Lender as in effect at the time of such reallocation and (B) neither such reallocation nor any payment by a Non-Defaulting
Lender pursuant thereto will constitute a waiver or release of any claim the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Letter of Credit Issuers or any other
Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender or cause such Defaulting Lender to be a Non-Defaulting Lender, (ii) to the extent that all or any portion (the
“unreallocated portion”) of the Defaulting Lender’s Swingline Exposure or Letter of Credit Exposure cannot, or can only partially, be so reallocated to Non-
Defaulting Lenders, whether by reason of the first proviso in Section 2.15(c)(i) or otherwise, the Borrower shall within two Business Days following notice by
the Administrative Agent or the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer (x) first, prepay such Swingline Exposure and (y) second, Cash Collateralize for the benefit
of the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer only the Borrower’s obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure (after giving
effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above), in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.8 for so long as such Letter of Credit
Exposure is outstanding, (iii) if the Borrower Cash Collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure pursuant to this
Section 2.15(c), the Borrower shall not be
 
52
[CREDIT AGREEMENT]
10-Q
required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 4.1(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure during the
period such Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure is Cash Collateralized, (iv) if the Letter of Credit Exposure of the Non-Defaulting Lenders is
reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.15(c), then the Letter of Credit Fees payable for the account of the Lenders pursuant to Section 4.1(b) shall be adjusted
in accordance with such Non-Defaulting Lenders’ Commitment Percentages and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any Swingline or Letter of Credit
Fees to the Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 4.1(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure during the period that such
Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure is reallocated, or (v) if any Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure is neither Cash Collateralized nor
reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.15(c), then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Letter of Credit Issuer or any Lender hereunder, all Letter
of Credit Fees payable under Section 4.1(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure shall be payable to the Letter of Credit Issuer
until such Letter of Credit Exposure is Cash Collateralized and/or reallocated;
(d) So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Swingline Lender shall be required to fund any Swingline Loan and no Letter of Credit Issuer will be
required to issue any new Letter of Credit or amend any outstanding Letter of Credit to increase the Stated Amount thereof, alter the drawing terms
thereunder or extend the expiry date thereof, unless (i) in the case of any Letter of Credit Issuer, such Letter of Credit Issuer is reasonably satisfied that any
exposure that would result from the exposure to such Defaulting Lender is eliminated or fully covered by the Commitments of the Non-Defaulting Lenders or
by Cash Collateralization or a combination thereof in accordance with clause (c) above or otherwise in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Letter of
Credit Issuer, and (ii) in the case of any Swingline Lender or any Letter of Credit Issuer, it is reasonably satisfied that participating interests in any such newly
made Swingline Loan or newly issued or increased Letter of Credit, as applicable, shall be allocated among Non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent
with Section 2.15(c) (and Defaulting Lenders shall not participate therein); and
(e) If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lenders and each Letter of Credit Issuer agree in writing in their discretion that a Lender that is a
Defaulting Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon, as of the effective date specified in
such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the
extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may
determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans to be held pro rata by the
Lenders in accordance with the Commitments (without giving effect to Section 2.15(c)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender;
provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was
a Defaulting Lender; provided further that, except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting
Lender to Non-Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lender’s having been a Defaulting
Lender.
 
53
[CREDIT AGREEMENT]
10-Q
(f) Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of that Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary
or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article XI or otherwise, and including any amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by that Defaulting
Lender pursuant to Section 13.8), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of
any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by
that Defaulting Lender to each Letter of Credit Issuer and the Swingline Lenders hereunder; third, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or
Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this
Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fourth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a non-interest
bearing deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of that Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Agreement; fifth, to the payment of any
amounts owing to the Lenders, the Letter of Credit Issuers or the Swingline Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained
by any Lender, such Letter of Credit Issuer or the Swingline Lenders against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender’s breach of its
obligations under this Agreement; sixth, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of
any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender’s breach of its
obligations under this Agreement; and seventh, to that Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if such
payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or Unpaid Drawings, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the relevant Loans of, and
Unpaid Drawings owed to, the relevant non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied in the manner set forth in this Section 2.15(f). Any
payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to
post Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 3.8 shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents
hereto.
2.16 Extension of Maturity Date.
(a) Not earlier than 60 days prior to, nor later than 30 days prior to, any anniversary date of the Closing Date, the Borrower may, upon notice to the
Administrative Agent (who shall promptly notify the Lenders), request a one year extension of the then current Maturity Date, provided, however, that the
Borrower may request only two such extensions under this Agreement. Within 15 days of delivery of such notice, each Lender shall notify the Administrative
Agent whether or not it consents to such extension (which consent may be given or withheld in such Lender’s sole and absolute discretion). Any Lender not
responding within the above time period shall be deemed not to have consented to such extension. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the
Borrower and the Lenders of the Lenders’ responses. If any Lender declines, or is deemed to have declined, to consent to such extension (a “Declining
Lender”), the Borrower may cause any such Declining Lender to be removed or replaced as a Lender pursuant to Section 13.7.
 
54
[CREDIT AGREEMENT]
10-Q
(b) Only if Majority Lenders (calculated prior to giving effect to any removals and/or replacements of Lenders permitted herein) (the “Consenting Lenders”)
have consented to an extension requested pursuant to this Section, the Maturity Date shall be extended, with respect only to the Consenting Lenders and
any Lender replacing a Declining Lender pursuant to Section 13.7. If so extended, the Maturity Date, as to the Consenting Lenders and each Lender
replacing a Declining Lender pursuant to Section 13.7, shall be extended to the date falling one year after the existing Maturity Date (except that if such date
is not a Business Day, such Maturity Date, as so extended, shall be the next preceding Business Day); provided, however, that the pre-existing Maturity Date
shall remain in effect with respect to any Declining Lender that is not replaced (such Declining Lender’s “Existing Maturity Date”). The Administrative Agent
and the Borrower shall promptly confirm to the Lenders such extension, and the Administrative Agent shall distribute an amended Schedule 1.1(a) (which
shall be deemed incorporated into this Agreement), to reflect any changes in Lenders and their respective Commitments. If the Maturity Date is extended
pursuant to this Section 2.16 with respect to some but not all of the Lenders, then no Letter of Credit may expire after the date that is five Business Days prior
to an Existing Maturity Date in respect of any Declining Lender if, after giving effect to such Letter of Credit, the aggregate Commitments of the Consenting
Lenders and each Lender replacing a Declining Lender for the period following such Existing Maturity Date would be less than the L/C Obligations following
such Existing Maturity Date (after giving effect to any Cash Collateral with respect to such Letter of Credit or other arrangements with respect thereto
satisfactory to the applicable Letter of Credit Issuers and the Administrative Agent).
(c) As a condition precedent to such extension, the Borrower shall have provided to the Administrative Agent the following, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (i) copies of corporate resolutions certified by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Borrower, or such other
evidence as may be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, demonstrating that the Borrower’s incurrence of indebtedness hereunder with a
maturity date of the Maturity Date, as extended pursuant to this Section, has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, (ii) a certificate, signed
by an Authorized Officer of the Borrower certifying that, before and immediately after giving effect to such extension, (A) the representations and warranties of
the Borrower and the other Credit Parties in the Credit Documents (other than, during a Specified Period, those set forth in Sections 8.4 and 8.20) are true
and correct in all material respects (unless such representations and warranties are already qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect, in which case
they are true and correct in all respects) with the same effect as though such representations and warranties had been made on and as of the date of such
extension (except where such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties shall
have been true and correct in all material respects (unless such representations and warranties are already qualified by materiality or Material Adverse
Effect, in which case they are true and correct in all respects) as of such earlier date), and (B) no Default or Event of Default exists.
(d) The Borrower shall, on the Existing Maturity Date with respect to any Declining Lender that has not been replaced as a Lender pursuant to Section 13.7
pay in full all Obligations owing to such Declining Lender, and such Declining Lender’s Commitment and participation in any Letter of Credit or Swingline
Loan outstanding hereunder shall terminate on such Existing Maturity Date.

2.17 Increase of Commitments.
(a) Subject to the conditions set forth in Section 2.17(b), the Borrower may, from time to time (including in connection with any redetermination of the
Borrowing Base), increase the existing Total Commitment then in effect (any such increase a “Incremental Increase”) by increasing the Commitment of a
Lender (an “Increasing Lender”) or by causing a Person that at such time is not a Lender to become a Lender (an “Additional Lender”).
(b) Any Incremental Increase shall be subject to the following additional conditions:
(i) no Incremental Increase shall be less than $25,000,000 (and increments of $1,000,000 above that minimum) unless the Administrative Agent otherwise
consents, and no Incremental Increase shall be permitted if after the funding thereof the Total Commitment would exceed the Maximum Aggregate Amount;
(ii) (A) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (B) the representations and warranties of the Borrower and the other Credit Parties in the
Credit Documents (other than, during a Specified Period, those set forth in Sections 8.4 and 8.20) shall be true and correct in all material respects (unless
such representations and warranties are already qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect, in which case they are true and correct in all respects)
with the same effect as though such representations and warranties had been made on and as of the date of such Incremental Increase (except where such
representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties shall have been true and correct in all
material respects (unless such representations and warranties are already qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect, in which case they shall be true
and correct in all respects) as of such earlier date) and (C) the Borrower shall be in compliance, on a Pro Forma Basis, with the Financial Performance
Covenants;
(iii) no Lender’s Commitment may be increased without the consent of such Lender;
(iv) the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lenders and the Letter of Credit Issuers must consent to the addition of any Additional Lender to the extent the
consent of such Person would be required if an assignment were being made to such proposed Additional Lender under Section 13.6(b);
(v) after giving effect to the requested Incremental Increase, the Borrower shall not have requested more than five Incremental Increases prior to the
Termination Date;
(vi) the maturity date of any Incremental Increase shall be the same as the Maturity Date; and
(vii) any Incremental Increase shall be on the exact same terms and pursuant to the exact same documentation (including the Applicable Margin) applicable
to this Agreement (other than with respect to any arrangement, structuring, upfront or other fees or discounts payable in connection with such Incremental
Increase).
 
56
[CREDIT AGREEMENT]
10-Q
(c) Each Increasing Lender and Additional Lender (if any) shall execute and deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lenders and
the Letter of Credit Issuers customary documentation (any such documentation, an “Incremental Agreement”) implementing any Incremental Increase. Upon
receipt by the Administrative Agent of one or more executed Incremental Agreements increasing the Commitments of Lenders and/or adding Commitments
from Additional Lenders as provided in this Section 2.17, (i) the Total Commitment shall be increased automatically on the effective date set forth in such
Incremental Agreements by the aggregate amount indicated in such Incremental Agreements without further action by the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent, any Swingline Lender, any Letter of Credit Issuer or any Lender, (ii) Schedule 1.1(a) and the Register shall each be amended to reflect the
Incremental Increase, and the Commitment Percentages of the Lenders shall be adjusted accordingly to reflect the Incremental Increase, (iii) the
Administrative Agent shall distribute to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lenders, the Letter of Credit Issuers and each Lender the
revised Schedule 1.1(a), (iv) any such Additional Lender shall be deemed to be a party in all respects to this Agreement and any other Credit Documents to
which the Lenders are a party, and (v) upon the effective date set forth in such Incremental Agreement, the Lenders party to the Incremental Agreement shall
purchase a pro rata portion of the outstanding Loans (including participations in L/C Obligations or Swingline Loans) of each of the current Lenders such that
each Lender (including any Additional Lender, if applicable) shall hold its respective Commitment Percentage of the outstanding Loans (and participation
interests in participations in L/C Obligations or Swingline Loans) as reflected in the revised Schedule 1.1(a) required by this Section 2.17.
ARTICLE III
LETTERS OF CREDIT
3.1 Letters of Credit.
(a) Subject to and upon the terms and conditions herein set forth, at any time and from time to time on and after the Closing Date and prior to the L/C Maturity
Date, the Letter of Credit Issuer agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of the Lenders set forth in this Article III, to issue upon the request of the Borrower
and for the direct or indirect benefit of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries (or, during an Investment Grade Period, its Subsidiaries), a letter of credit
or letters of credit (the “Letters of Credit” and each, a “Letter of Credit”) in such form and with such Issuer Documents as may be approved by the Letter of
Credit Issuer in its reasonable discretion; provided that the Borrower shall be a co-applicant of, and jointly and severally liable with respect to, each Letter of
Credit issued for the account of a Restricted Subsidiary (or, during an Investment Grade Period, a Subsidiary); provided further that each letter of credit
outstanding on the Closing Date under the Existing Credit Agreement and listed on Schedule 3.1 hereto shall be deemed to be a Letter of Credit hereunder.
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no Letter of Credit shall be issued the Stated Amount of which, when added to the Letters of Credit Outstanding at such
time, would exceed the Letter of Credit Commitment then in effect, (ii) no Letter of Credit shall be issued the Stated Amount of which would cause the Total
Exposure at such time to exceed the Loan Limit then in effect, (iii) each Letter of Credit shall have an expiration date occurring no later than one year after the
date of issuance or such longer period of time as may be agreed by the applicable

provided that any Letter of Credit may provide for automatic renewal thereof for additional periods of up to 12 months or such longer period of time as may be
agreed by the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer, subject to the provisions of Section 3.2(b); provided, further, that in no event shall such expiration date occur
later than the L/C Maturity Date unless arrangements which are reasonably satisfactory to the Letter of Credit Issuer to Cash Collateralize (or backstop) such
Letter of Credit have been made (provided, however, that no Lenders shall be obligated to fund participations in respect of any Letter of Credit after the
Maturity Date), (iv) each Letter of Credit shall be denominated in Dollars, (v) no Letter of Credit shall be issued if it would be illegal under any applicable
Requirement of Law for the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit to have a Letter of Credit issued in its favor, (vi) no Letter of Credit shall be issued by a Letter of
Credit Issuer (provided that another Letter of Credit Issuer, not subject to the constraints of this Section 3.1(b)(vi), may issue such Letter of Credit) if (A) any
order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain such Letter of Credit Issuer from issuing
the Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to such Letter of Credit Issuer or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any
Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such Letter of Credit Issuer shall prohibit, or request that such Letter of Credit Issuer refrain from, the issuance
of letters of credit generally or the Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon such Letter of Credit Issuer with respect to the Letter of Credit any
restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which such Letter of Credit Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or
shall impose upon such Letter of Credit Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which such Letter
of Credit Issuer in good faith deems material to it or (B) the issuance of the Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of such Letter of Credit Issuer
generally, and (vii) no Letter of Credit shall be issued by a Letter of Credit Issuer after it has received a written notice from any Credit Party or the
Administrative Agent or the Majority Lenders stating that a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing until such time as the Letter of Credit
Issuer shall have received a written notice (A) of rescission of such notice from the party or parties originally delivering such notice, (B) of the waiver of such
Default or Event of Default in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.1 or (C) that such Default or Event of Default is no longer continuing.
(c) Upon at least one Business Day’s prior written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) to the Administrative Agent and the Letter of
Credit Issuer (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the applicable Lenders), the Borrower shall have the right, on any day,
permanently to terminate or reduce the Letter of Credit Commitment in whole or in part; provided that, after giving effect to such termination or reduction, the
Letters of Credit Outstanding shall not exceed the Letter of Credit Commitment.
3.2 Letter of Credit Requests.
(a) Whenever the Borrower desires that a Letter of Credit be issued, the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent and the Letter of Credit Issuer a Letter
of Credit Request by no later than 1:00 p.m. at least two (or such lesser number as may be agreed upon by the Administrative Agent and the Letter of Credit
Issuer) Business Days prior to the proposed

date of issuance. Each notice shall be executed by the Borrower and shall be in the form of Exhibit B or such other form (including by electronic or fax
transmission) as reasonably agreed between the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Letter of Credit Issuer (each a “Letter of Credit Request”). No
Letter of Credit Issuer shall issue any Letters of Credit unless such Letter of Credit Issuer shall have received notice from the Administrative Agent that the
conditions to such issuance have been met, which notice shall be deemed given (i) if the Letter of Credit Issuer has not received notice from the
Administrative Agent that the conditions to such issuance have been met within two Business Days after the date of the applicable Letter of Credit Request
or (ii) if the aggregate amount of Letters of Credit Outstanding issued by such Letter of Credit Issuer then outstanding does not exceed the amount theretofore
agreed to by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and such Letter of Credit Issuer, and the Administrative Agent has not otherwise notified such Letter of
Credit Issuer that it may no longer rely on this clause (ii).
(b) If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Request, the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer shall issue a Letter of Credit that has
automatic extension provisions (each, an “Auto-Extension Letter of Credit”); provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit such Letter of
Credit Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in each 12-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving
prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the “Non-Extension Notice Date”) in each such 12-month period to be agreed upon at the time such
Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the Letter of Credit Issuer, the Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to such Letter
of Credit Issuer for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may
not require) the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the L/C Maturity
Date; provided, however, that such Letter of Credit Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (i) such Letter of Credit Issuer has determined that it would
not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of
the provisions of clause (b) of Section 3.1 or otherwise), or (ii) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is five
Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (A) from the Administrative Agent that the Majority Lenders have elected not to permit such extension
or (B) from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Article VII are not then satisfied,
and in each such case directing such Letter of Credit Issuer not to permit such extension.
(c) Each Letter of Credit Issuer (other than the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates) shall, at least once each week, provide the Administrative Agent
with a list of all Letters of Credit issued by it that are outstanding at such time; provided that, upon written request from the Administrative Agent, such Letter of
Credit Issuer shall thereafter notify the Administrative Agent in writing on each Business Day of all Letters of Credit issued on the prior Business Day by such
Letter of Credit Issuer.
(d) The making of each Letter of Credit Request shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty by the Borrower that the Letter of Credit may be issued
in accordance with, and will not violate the requirements of, Section 3.1(b).

3.3 Letter of Credit Participations.
(a) Immediately upon the issuance by any Letter of Credit Issuer of any Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Issuer shall be deemed to have sold and
transferred to each Lender (each such Lender, in its capacity under this Section 3.3, an “L/C Participant”), and each such L/C Participant shall be deemed
irrevocably and unconditionally to have purchased and received from such Letter of Credit Issuer, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and
participation (each an “L/C Participation”), to the extent of such L/C Participant’s Commitment Percentage, in each Letter of Credit, each substitute therefor,
each drawing made thereunder and the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement with respect thereto, and any security therefor or guaranty
pertaining thereto.
(b) In determining whether to pay under any Letter of Credit, the relevant Letter of Credit Issuer shall have no obligation relative to the L/C Participants other
than to confirm that (i) any documents required to be delivered under such Letter of Credit have been delivered, (ii) the Letter of Credit Issuer has examined
the documents with reasonable care and (iii) the documents appear to comply on their face with the requirements of such Letter of Credit. Any action taken or
omitted to be taken by the relevant Letter of Credit Issuer under or in connection with any Letter of Credit issued by it, if taken or omitted in the absence of
gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall not create for the Letter of Credit Issuer any resulting liability to the L/C Participants.
(c) In the event that any Letter of Credit Issuer makes any payment under any Letter of Credit issued by it and the Borrower shall not have repaid such
amount in full to the respective Letter of Credit Issuer pursuant to Section 3.4(a), or if any reimbursement payment is required to be refunded to the Borrower,
such Letter of Credit Issuer shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and each L/C Participant of such failure, and each such L/C Participant shall
promptly and unconditionally pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Letter of Credit Issuer, the amount of such L/C Participant’s Commitment
Percentage of such unreimbursed payment in Dollars and in immediately available funds; provided, however, that no L/C Participant shall be obligated to
pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Letter of Credit Issuer its Commitment Percentage of such unreimbursed amount arising from any
wrongful payment made by the Letter of Credit Issuer under any such Letter of Credit as a result of acts or omissions constituting willful misconduct or gross
negligence on the part of such Letter of Credit Issuer (as determined in a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction). Each L/C
Participant shall make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer such L/C Participant’s Commitment Percentage of
the amount of such payment no later than 1:00 p.m. on the first Business Day after the date notified by such Letter of Credit Issuer in immediately available
funds. If and to the extent such L/C Participant shall not have so made its Commitment Percentage of the amount of such payment available to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer, such L/C Participant agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of
such Letter of Credit Issuer, forthwith on demand, such amount, together with interest thereon for each day from such date until the date such amount is paid
to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Letter of Credit Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the Overnight Rate from time to time then in effect, plus
any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by such Letter of Credit Issuer in connection with the foregoing. The failure of any L/C
Participant
 
60
[CREDIT AGREEMENT]
10-Q
to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer its Commitment Percentage of any payment under any
Letter of Credit shall not relieve any other L/C Participant of its obligation hereunder to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of such
Letter of Credit Issuer its Commitment Percentage of any payment under such Letter of Credit on the date required, as specified above, but no L/C Participant
shall be responsible for the failure of any other L/C Participant to make available to the Administrative Agent such other L/C Participant’s Commitment
Percentage of any such payment.
(d) Whenever any Letter of Credit Issuer receives a payment in respect of an unpaid reimbursement obligation as to which the Administrative Agent has
received for the account of such Letter of Credit Issuer any payments from the L/C Participants pursuant to clause (c) above, such Letter of Credit Issuer shall
pay to the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to each L/C Participant that has paid its Commitment Percentage of such
reimbursement obligation, in Dollars and in immediately available funds, an amount equal to such L/C Participant’s share (based upon the proportionate
aggregate amount originally funded by such L/C Participant to the aggregate amount funded by all L/C Participants) of the principal amount so paid in
respect of such reimbursement obligation and interest thereon accruing after the purchase of the respective L/C Participations at the Overnight Rate.
(e) The obligations of the L/C Participants to make payments to the Administrative Agent for the account of a Letter of Credit Issuer with respect to Letters of
Credit shall be irrevocable and not subject to counterclaim, set-off or other defense or any other qualification or exception whatsoever and shall be made in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement under all circumstances, including under any of the following circumstances:
(i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents;
(ii) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right that the Borrower may have at any time against a beneficiary named in a Letter of Credit, any
transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such transferee may be acting), the Administrative Agent, the Letter of Credit Issuer, any
Lender or other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, the transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated transactions
(including any underlying transaction between the Borrower and the beneficiary named in any such Letter of Credit);
(iii) any draft, certificate or any other document presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or
any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;
(iv) the surrender or impairment of any security for the performance or observance of any of the terms of any of the Credit Documents; or
(v) the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default;
 
61
[CREDIT AGREEMENT]
10-Q
provided, however, that no L/C Participant shall be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Letter of Credit Issuer its Commitment
Percentage of any unreimbursed amount arising from any wrongful payment made by such Letter of Credit Issuer under a Letter of Credit as a result of acts or
omissions constituting willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence on the part of the Letter of Credit Issuer (as determined in a final and non-appealable
judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction).
3.4 Agreement to Repay Letter of Credit Drawings.
(a) The Borrower hereby agrees to reimburse each Letter of Credit Issuer by making payment in Dollars to the Administrative Agent for the account of such
Letter of Credit Issuer in immediately available funds, for any payment or disbursement made by such Letter of Credit Issuer under any Letter of Credit issued
by it (each such amount so paid until reimbursed, an “Unpaid Drawing”) (i) within one Business Day of the date of such payment or disbursement if such
Letter of Credit Issuer provides notice to the Borrower of such payment or disbursement prior to 11:00 a.m. on such next succeeding Business Day (from the
date of such payment or disbursement) or (ii) if such notice is received after such time, on the next Business Day following the date of receipt of such notice
(such required date for reimbursement under clause (i) or (ii), as applicable, on such Business Day (the “Reimbursement Date”)), with interest on the amount
so paid or disbursed by such Letter of Credit Issuer, from and including the date of such payment or disbursement to but excluding the Reimbursement Date,
at the per annum rate for each day equal to the rate described in Section 2.8(a); provided that, notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, with respect to any Letter of Credit, (i) unless the Borrower shall have notified the Administrative Agent and the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer
prior to 11:00 a.m. on the Reimbursement Date that the Borrower intends to reimburse such Letter of Credit Issuer for the amount of such drawing with funds
other than the proceeds of Loans, the Borrower shall be deemed to have given a Notice of Borrowing requesting that the Lenders make Loans (which shall
be ABR Loans) on the Reimbursement Date in an amount equal to the amount of the Unpaid Drawing, and (ii) the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify
each Lender of such drawing and the amount of its Loan to be made in respect thereof, and each Lender shall be irrevocably obligated to make a Loan to the
Borrower in the manner deemed to have been requested in the amount of its Commitment Percentage of the applicable Unpaid Drawing by 12:00 noon on
such Reimbursement Date by making the amount of such Loan available to the Administrative Agent. Such Loans made in respect of such Unpaid Drawing
on such Reimbursement Date shall be made without regard to the limits of Section 2.2 and without regard to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Article VII. The Administrative Agent shall use the proceeds of such Loans solely for purpose of reimbursing the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer for the
related Unpaid Drawing (and upon the application of the proceeds of such Loans to such Unpaid Drawing, the Borrower’s obligations with respect to such
Unpaid Drawing shall be satisfied in full and replaced with an obligation to repay such Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement). In the event
that the Borrower fails to Cash Collateralize any Letter of Credit that is outstanding on the Maturity Date (or make other arrangements with respect thereto
satisfactory to the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer and the Administrative Agent), the full amount of the Letter of Exposure in respect of such Letter of Credit
shall be deemed to be an Unpaid Drawing subject to the provisions of this Section 3.4 except that such Letter of Credit Issuer shall hold the proceeds
received from the Lenders as contemplated above as Cash Collateral for such Letter of Credit to reimburse any Drawing under
 
62
[CREDIT AGREEMENT]
10-Q
such Letter of Credit and shall use such proceeds first, to reimburse itself for any Drawings made in respect of such Letter of Credit following the L/C Maturity
Date, second, to the extent such Letter of Credit expires or is returned undrawn while any such Cash Collateral remains, to the repayment of obligations in
respect of any Loans that have not paid at such time and third, to the Borrower or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this
Section 3.4(a) shall affect the Borrower’s obligation to repay all outstanding Loans when due in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(b) The obligations of the Borrower under this Section 3.4 to reimburse each Letter of Credit Issuer with respect to Unpaid Drawings (including, in each case,
interest thereon) shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any set-off, counterclaim or defense to payment
that the Borrower or any other Person may have or have had against such Letter of Credit Issuer, the Administrative Agent or any Lender (including in its
capacity as an L/C Participant), including any defense based upon the failure of any drawing under a Letter of Credit (each a “Drawing”) to conform to the
terms of the Letter of Credit or any non-application or misapplication by the beneficiary of the proceeds of such Drawing; provided that the Borrower shall not
be obligated to reimburse any Letter of Credit Issuer for any wrongful payment made by such Letter of Credit Issuer under the Letter of Credit issued by it as a
result of acts or omissions constituting willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence on the part of such Letter of Credit Issuer (as determined in a final
and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction).
3.5 Increased Costs. If, after the Closing Date, the adoption of any Change in Law shall either (a) impose, modify or make applicable any reserve, deposit,
capital adequacy, liquidity or similar requirement against Letters of Credit issued by any Letter of Credit Issuer, or any L/C Participant’s L/C Participation
therein, or (b) impose on any Letter of Credit Issuer or any L/C Participant any other conditions, costs or expenses affecting its obligations under this
Agreement in respect of Letters of Credit or L/C Participations therein or any Letter of Credit or such L/C Participant’s L/C Participation therein, and the result
of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Letter of Credit Issuer or such L/C Participant of issuing, maintaining or participating in any Letter of
Credit, as applicable, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Letter of Credit Issuer or such L/C Participant hereunder (other than
(i) Taxes indemnifiable under Section 5.4, or (ii) Excluded Taxes) in respect of Letters of Credit or L/C Participations therein, then, promptly (and in any event
no later than 15 Business Days) after receipt of written demand to the Borrower by such Letter of Credit Issuer or such L/C Participant, as the case may be (a
copy of which notice shall be sent by such Letter of Credit Issuer or such L/C Participant to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Letter of
Credit Issuer or such L/C Participant such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Letter of Credit Issuer or such L/C Participant for such
increased cost or reduction, it being understood and agreed, however, that such Letter of Credit Issuer or an L/C Participant shall not be entitled to such
compensation as a result of such Person’s compliance with, or pursuant to any request or directive to comply with, any such Requirement of Law as in effect
on the Closing Date (except as otherwise set forth in the definition of Change in Law). A certificate submitted to the Borrower by the relevant Letter of Credit
Issuer or an L/C Participant, as the case may be (a copy of which certificate shall be sent by such Letter of Credit Issuer or such L/C Participant to the
Administrative Agent), setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for the determination of such additional amount or amounts necessary to compensate such
Letter of Credit Issuer or such L/C Participant as aforesaid shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower absent clearly demonstrable error.

3.6 New or Successor Letter of Credit Issuers.
(a) Any Letter of Credit Issuer may resign as a Letter of Credit Issuer upon 30 days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the
Borrower. The Borrower may replace any Letter of Credit Issuer for any reason upon written notice to such Letter of Credit Issuer and the Administrative
Agent and may add Letter of Credit Issuers at any time upon notice to the Administrative Agent. If any Letter of Credit Issuer shall resign or be replaced, or if
the Borrower shall decide to add a new Letter of Credit Issuer under this Agreement, then the Borrower may appoint from among the Lenders a successor
issuer of Letters of Credit or a new Letter of Credit Issuer, as the case may be, or, with the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld) and such new Letter of Credit Issuer, another successor or new issuer of Letters of Credit, whereupon such successor issuer shall
succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the replaced or resigning Letter of Credit Issuer under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, or such
new issuer of Letters of Credit shall be granted the rights, powers and duties of a Letter of Credit Issuer hereunder, and the term “Letter of Credit Issuer” shall
mean such successor or such new issuer of Letters of Credit effective upon such appointment. The acceptance of any appointment as a Letter of Credit
Issuer hereunder whether as a successor issuer or new issuer of Letters of Credit in accordance with this Agreement, shall be evidenced by an agreement
entered into by such new or successor issuer of Letters of Credit, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and, from
and after the effective date of such agreement, such new or successor issuer of Letters of Credit shall become a “Letter of Credit Issuer” hereunder. After the
resignation or replacement of a Letter of Credit Issuer hereunder, the resigning or replaced Letter of Credit Issuer shall remain a party hereto and shall
continue to have all the rights and obligations of a Letter of Credit Issuer under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents with respect to Letters of
Credit issued by it prior to such resignation or replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit. In connection with any resignation
or replacement pursuant to this clause (a) (but, in case of any such resignation, only to the extent that a successor issuer of Letters of Credit shall have been
appointed), either (i) the Borrower, the resigning or replaced Letter of Credit Issuer and the successor issuer of Letters of Credit shall arrange to have any
outstanding Letters of Credit issued by the resigning or replaced Letter of Credit Issuer replaced with Letters of Credit issued by the successor issuer of
Letters of Credit or (ii) the Borrower shall cause the successor issuer of Letters of Credit, if such successor issuer is reasonably satisfactory to the replaced or
resigning Letter of Credit Issuer, to issue “back-stop” Letters of Credit naming the resigning or replaced Letter of Credit Issuer as beneficiary for each
outstanding Letter of Credit issued by the resigning or replaced Letter of Credit Issuer, which new Letters of Credit shall have a Stated Amount equal to the
Letters of Credit being back-stopped and the sole requirement for drawing on such new Letters of Credit shall be a drawing on the corresponding back-
stopped Letters of Credit. After any resigning or replaced Letter of Credit Issuer’s resignation or replacement as Letter of Credit Issuer, the provisions of this
Agreement relating to a Letter of Credit Issuer shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it (A) while it was a Letter of Credit
Issuer under this Agreement or (B) at any time with respect to Letters of Credit issued by such Letter of Credit Issuer.
 
64
[CREDIT AGREEMENT]
10-Q
(b) To the extent that there are, at the time of any resignation or replacement as set forth in clause (a) above, any outstanding Letters of Credit, nothing herein
shall be deemed to impact or impair any rights and obligations of any of the parties hereto with respect to such outstanding Letters of Credit (including any
obligations related to the payment of fees or the reimbursement or funding of amounts drawn), except that the Borrower, the resigning or replaced Letter of
Credit Issuer and the successor issuer of Letters of Credit shall have the obligations regarding outstanding Letters of Credit described in clause (a) above.
3.7 Role of Letter of Credit Issuer. Each Lender and the Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, no Letter of Credit Issuer shall
have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to
ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the
Letter of Credit Issuers, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective affiliates nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of any Letter of Credit Issuer
shall be liable to any Lender for (a) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Majority Lenders, (b) any
action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct or (c) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any
document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document. The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary
or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower’s pursuing
such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the Letter of Credit Issuers, the
Administrative Agent, any of their respective affiliates nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of any Letter of Credit Issuer shall be liable or
responsible for any of the matters described in Section 3.3(e); provided that anything in such Section to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have
a claim against the Letter of Credit Issuer, and the Letter of Credit Issuer may be liable to the Borrower in accordance with Section 3.4(b) and, to the extent,
but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to special, indirect, consequential, exemplary or punitive, damages suffered by the Borrower as a result of
such Letter of Credit Issuer’s willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence (as determined in a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction) or such Letter of Credit Issuer’s willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and
certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Letter of Credit
Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to
the contrary, and no Letter of Credit Issuer shall be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to
transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for
any reason.
3.8 Cash Collateral.
(a) Upon the request of the Majority Lenders if, as of the L/C Maturity Date, there are any Letters of Credit Outstanding, the Borrower shall immediately Cash
Collateralize such Letters of Credit Outstanding.
 
65
[CREDIT AGREEMENT]
10-Q
(b) If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Majority Lenders may require that the L/C Obligations be Cash Collateralized; provided that,
upon the occurrence of an Event of Default referred to in Section 11.5 with respect to the Borrower, the Borrower shall immediately Cash Collateralize the
Letters of Credit then outstanding and no notice or request by or consent from the Majority Lenders shall be required.
(c) For purposes of this Agreement, “Cash Collateralize” shall mean to pledge and deposit with or deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the
Letter of Credit Issuer and the Lenders, as collateral for the L/C Obligations, cash or deposit account balances in an amount equal to the amount of the
Letters of Credit Outstanding required to be Cash Collateralized pursuant to documentation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent and the Letter of Credit Issuers (which documents are hereby consented to by the Lenders). Derivatives of such term have
corresponding meanings. The Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Letter of Credit Issuers and the L/C Participants, a
security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein and all proceeds of the foregoing. Such Cash Collateral shall be maintained in
blocked, interest bearing deposit accounts established by and in the name of the Borrower, but under the “control” (as defined in Section 9-104 of the Uniform
Commercial Code) of the Administrative Agent.
3.9 Applicability of ISP and UCP. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the Letter of Credit Issuer and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued, (a) the
rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit and (b) the rules of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, as most recently
published by the International Chamber of Commerce at the time of issuance, shall apply to each commercial Letter of Credit.
3.10 Conflict with Issuer Documents. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms hereof and the terms of any Issuer Document, the terms
hereof shall control.
3.11 Letters of Credit Issued for Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations of, or is
for the account of, a Restricted Subsidiary (or, during an Investment Grade period, a Subsidiary), the Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the applicable
Letter of Credit Issuer hereunder for any and all drawings under such Letter of Credit. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of Letters of
Credit for the account of Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of the Borrower, and that the Borrower’s business derives substantial benefits from the businesses
of its Subsidiaries.
ARTICLE IV
FEES; COMMITMENTS
4.1 Fees.
(a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent in Dollars, for the account of each Lender (in each case pro rata according to the respective

Date. Each Commitment Fee shall be payable by the Borrower (i) quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and
December (for the three-month period (or portion thereof) ended on such day for which no
 
66
[CREDIT AGREEMENT]
10-Q
payment has been received) and (ii) on the Termination Date (for the period ended on such date for which no payment has been received pursuant to clause
(i) above), and shall be computed for each day during such period at a rate per annum equal to the Commitment Fee Rate in effect on such day on the
Available Commitment (assuming for this purpose that any Swingline Exposure does not reduce the Available Commitment) in effect on such day.
(b) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent in Dollars for the account of the Lenders pro rata on the basis of their respective Letter of Credit
Exposure, a fee in respect of each Letter of Credit (the “Letter of Credit Fee”), for the period from the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit until the
termination or expiration date of such Letter of Credit computed at the per annum rate for each day equal to the Applicable Margin for LIBOR Loans on the
average daily Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit. Such Letter of Credit Fees shall be due and payable (i) quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of
each March, June, September and December and (ii) on the Termination Date (for the period for which no payment has been received pursuant to clause
(i) above).
(c) The Borrower agrees to pay to each Letter of Credit Issuer a fronting fee in respect of each Letter of Credit issued by it, for the period from the date of
issuance of such Letter of Credit to the termination or expiration date of such Letter of Credit, computed at the rate for each day equal to 0.125% per annum
(or such other amount a may be agreed in a separate writing between the Borrower and any Letter of Credit Issuer) on the average daily Stated Amount of
such Letter of Credit (or at such other rate per annum as agreed in writing between the Borrower and the Letter of Credit Issuer). Such fronting fees shall be
due and payable by the Borrower (i) quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December and (ii) on the Termination
Date (for the period for which no payment has been received pursuant to clause (i) above).
(d) The Borrower agrees to pay directly to each Letter of Credit Issuer upon each issuance of, drawing under, and/or amendment of, a Letter of Credit issued
by it such amount as such Letter of Credit Issuer and the Borrower shall have agreed upon for issuances of, drawings under or amendments of, letters of
credit issued by it.
(e) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent the administrative agent fees in the amounts and on the dates as set forth in writing from time to
time between the Administrative Agent and the Borrower.
4.2 Termination or Reduction of Commitments.
(a) Upon at least two Business Days’ prior written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative
Agent’s Office (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the Lenders), the Borrower shall have the right, without premium or
penalty, on any day, to permanently terminate or reduce the Commitments, as determined by the Borrower, in whole or in part; provided that (i) any such
termination or reduction shall apply ratably to reduce each Lender’s Commitment, (b) any partial reduction pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall be in the amount
of at least $10,000,000 and in an integral multiple of $2,500,000 in excess thereof and (c) after giving effect to such termination or reduction and to any
prepayments of Loans and to the cancellation or Cash
 
67
[CREDIT AGREEMENT]
10-Q
Collateralization of Letters of Credit (or other arrangements with respect thereto satisfactory to the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer and the Administrative
Agent) made on the date thereof in accordance with this Agreement, the Total Exposure shall not exceed the Loan Limit.
(b) The Borrower may terminate the unused amount of the Commitment of a Defaulting Lender upon not less than two (2) Business Days’ prior notice to the
Administrative Agent (which will promptly notify the Lenders thereof), and in such event the provisions of Section 2.15(f) will apply to all amounts thereafter
paid by the Borrower for the account of such Defaulting Lender under this Agreement (whether on account of principal, interest, fees, indemnity or other
amounts), provided that such termination will not be deemed to be a waiver or release of any claim the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, any Letter of
Credit Issuer, any Swingline Lender or any Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender.
(c) The Total Commitment and the Swingline Commitment shall terminate at 5:00 p.m. on the Termination Date.
ARTICLE V
PAYMENTS
5.1 Voluntary Prepayments. The Borrower shall have the right to prepay Loans and Swingline Loans, in each case, without premium or penalty, in whole or
in part from time to time on the following terms and conditions:
(a) the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent’s Office written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of
its intent to make such prepayment, the amount of such prepayment, the Type of Loans to be prepaid (or whether Swingline Loans are to be paid) and, in the

LIBOR Loans; and
(c) any prepayment of LIBOR Loans pursuant to this Section 5.1 on any day other than the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto shall be subject to

10-Q
to a Borrowing shall be applied pro rata among such Loans and (B) notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding clause (A), no prepayment of Loans shall
be applied to the Loans of any Defaulting Lender unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Borrower. In the absence of a designation by the Borrower under
Section 5.2(d), the Administrative Agent shall, subject to the above, make such designation in its reasonable discretion with a view, but no obligation, to
minimize breakage costs owing under Section 2.11.
5.2 Mandatory Prepayments.
(a) Repayment of Loans Following Excess Exposure. If, at any time, including as a result of giving effect to any termination or reduction of the Commitments

and, after all Swingline Loans have been paid in full, prepay the Loans on the date such excess has occurred in an aggregate principal amount equal to such
excess and (ii) if any excess remains after prepaying all of the Loans and Swingline Loans as a result of any Letter of Credit Exposure, pay to the
Administrative Agent on behalf of the Letter of Credit Issuers and the L/C Participants an amount in cash equal to such excess to be held as Cash Collateral

Borrowing Base Deficiency, then the Borrower shall, within 30 days after its receipt from the Administrative Agent of a notice of such Borrowing Base
Deficiency, inform the Administrative Agent of the Borrower’s election to take one or more of the following actions: (A) within 60 days following such election
prepay the Loans and/or Swingline Loans in an aggregate principal amount necessary to eliminate such Borrowing Base Deficiency, (B) prepay Loans in six

necessary to eliminate such Borrowing Base Deficiency (as such Borrowing Base Deficiency may be reduced during such six-month period), (C) within 30
days following such election, provide additional Collateral in the form of additional Oil and Gas Properties not evaluated in the most recently delivered
Reserve Report or other Collateral reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent having a Borrowing Base (as proposed by the Administrative Agent
and approved by the Required Lenders) sufficient, after giving effect to any other actions taken pursuant to this Section 5.2(b)(i) to eliminate any such
Borrowing Base Deficiency, or (D) undertake a combination of clauses (A), (B) and (C); provided that if a Borrowing Base Deficiency remains after prepaying
all of the Loans and Swingline Loans, the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize Letters of Credit in an amount equal to such remaining Borrowing Base
Deficiency as provided in Section 3.8; provided further, that all payments required to be made pursuant to this Section 5.2(b)(i) must be made on or prior to
the Termination Date.

[CREDIT AGREEMENT]
10-Q
(ii) During a Borrowing Base Trigger Period, upon any redetermination of the PV-9 in accordance with Sections 2.14(b), if there exists a PV-9 Deficiency,
then the Borrower shall, within 30 days after its receipt from the Administrative Agent of a notice of such PV-9 Deficiency, inform the Administrative Agent of

an aggregate principal amount necessary to eliminate such PV-9 Deficiency, (B) within 30 days following such election, provide additional Collateral in the
form of additional Oil and Gas Properties not evaluated in the most recently delivered Reserve Report or other Collateral reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent having a PV-9 (as proposed by the Administrative Agent and approved by the Required Lenders) sufficient, after giving effect to any
other actions taken pursuant to this Section 5.2(b)(ii) to eliminate such PV-9 Deficiency, or (C) undertake a combination of clauses (A), and (B); provided that
if a PV-9 Deficiency remains after prepaying all of the Loans and Swingline Loans, the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize Letters of Credit in an amount
equal to such remaining PV-9 Deficiency as provided in Section 3.8; provided further, that all payments required to be made pursuant to this Section 5.2(b)(ii)
must be made on or prior to the Termination Date.
(c) Application to Loans. With respect to each prepayment of Loans under this Section 5.2, such prepayments shall be applied first towards the payment of
Swingline Loans, second to the payment of Loans and third if because of Letter of Credit Exposure, a Borrowing Base Deficiency or a PV-9 Deficiency
remains after prepaying all of the Swingline Loans and Loans, to Cash Collateralize such Letters of Credit.
(d) LIBOR Interest Periods. In lieu of making any payment pursuant to this Section 5.2 in respect of any LIBOR Loan, other than on the last day of the Interest
Period therefor so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Borrower at its option may deposit, on behalf of the Borrower, with
the Administrative Agent an amount equal to the amount of the LIBOR Loan to be prepaid and such LIBOR Loan shall be repaid on the last day of the Interest
Period therefor in the required amount. Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent in a corporate time deposit account established on terms
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, earning interest at the then customary rate for accounts of such type. Such deposit shall constitute Cash
Collateral for the LIBOR Loans to be so prepaid; provided that the Borrower may at any time direct that such deposit be applied to make the applicable
payment required pursuant to this Section 5.2.
5.3 Method and Place of Payment.
(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all payments under this Agreement shall be made by the Borrower without set-off, counterclaim or
deduction of any kind, to the Administrative Agent for the ratable account of the Lenders entitled thereto or the Letter of Credit Issuer or the Swingline Lender
entitled thereto, as the case may be, not later than 2:00 p.m., in each case, on the date when due and shall be made in immediately available funds at the
Administrative Agent’s Office or at such other office as the Administrative Agent shall specify for such purpose by notice to the Borrower; it being understood
that written or facsimile notice by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent to make a payment from the funds in the Borrower’s account at the Administrative
Agent’s Office shall constitute the making of such payment to the extent of such funds held in such account. All repayments or prepayments of any Loans
(whether of principal, interest or otherwise) hereunder and all other payments under each Credit Document shall be made in Dollars. The Administrative
Agent will thereafter cause to be
 
70
[CREDIT AGREEMENT]
10-Q
distributed on the same day (if payment was actually received by the Administrative Agent prior to 2:00 p.m. or, if payment was not actually so received by the
Administrative Agent by such time, on the next Business Day in the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent), like funds relating to the payment of principal
or interest or fees ratably to the Lenders, the Letter of Credit Issuers and/or the Swingline Lenders, as applicable, entitled thereto.
(b) For purposes of computing interest or fees, any payments under this Agreement that are made later than 2:00 p.m. in respect of Loans or 4:00 p.m. in
respect of Swingline Loans shall be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day in the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent.
Whenever any payment to be made hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the
next succeeding Business Day and, with respect to payments of principal, interest shall be payable during such extension at the applicable rate in effect
immediately prior to such extension.
5.4 Net Payments.
(a) Any and all payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower or any Guarantor under this Agreement or any other Credit Document shall be made free and
clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if the Borrower or any Guarantor or
the Administrative Agent shall be required by applicable Requirements of Law to deduct or withhold any Taxes from such payments, then (i) the Borrower or
such Guarantor or the Administrative Agent shall make such deductions or withholdings as are reasonably determined by the Borrower, such Guarantor or
the Administrative Agent to be required by any applicable Requirement of Law, (ii) the Borrower, such Guarantor or the Administrative Agent, as applicable,
shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority within the time allowed and in accordance with applicable
Requirements of Law, and (iii) to the extent withholding or deduction is required to be made on account of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the sum
payable by the Borrower or such Guarantor shall be increased as necessary so that, after making all required deductions and withholdings (including
deductions or withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 5.4), the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the case may be,
receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings on account of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes been
made. Whenever any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes are payable by the Borrower or such Guarantor, as promptly as possible thereafter, the Borrower or
Guarantor shall send to the Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of such Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an official
receipt (or other evidence acceptable to such Lender, acting reasonably) received by the Borrower or such Guarantor showing payment thereof. After any
payment of Taxes by any Credit Party or the Administrative Agent to a Governmental Authority as provided in this Section 5.4, the Borrower shall deliver to
the Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Borrower, as the case may be, a copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental
Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return required by laws to report such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory
to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be.

[CREDIT AGREEMENT]
10-Q
(b) The Borrower shall timely pay and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and each Lender with regard to any Other Taxes (whether
or not such Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority).
(c) The Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and each Lender within 15 Business Days after written demand therefor, for the
full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be (including Indemnified Taxes
or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 5.4), and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with
respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.
A certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis and calculation of the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the
Administrative Agent (as applicable) on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d) Each Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law and such other reasonably requested information as will permit
the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine (A) whether or not any payments made hereunder or under any other Credit
Document are subject to Taxes, (B) if applicable, the required rate of withholding or deduction, and (C) such Lender’s entitlement to any available exemption
from, or reduction of, applicable Taxes in respect of any payments to be made to such Lender by any Credit Party pursuant to any Credit Document or
otherwise to establish such Lender’s status for withholding tax purposes in the applicable jurisdiction. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or
the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information
reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such
documentation (other than the documentation set forth in Section 5.4(e), (h) and (i)) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such
completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or
commercial position of such Lender.
(e) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.4(d), any Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) on or prior to the date on which such Non-
U.S. Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
(i) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest
under any Credit Document, executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of,
U.S. federal withholding Tax
 
72
[CREDIT AGREEMENT]
10-Q
pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Credit Document, Internal Revenue
Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other
income” article of such tax treaty;
(ii) executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI;
(iii) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate to the effect
that such Non-U.S. Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the
meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance
Certificate”) and (y) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or
(iv) to the extent a Non-U.S. Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY, accompanied by Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate, Internal Revenue Service Form
W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Non-U.S. Lender is a partnership and one or more
direct or indirect partners of such Non-U.S. Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Non-U.S. Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance
Certificate on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; and
(v) two further copies of any such form or certification (or any applicable successor form) on or before the date that any such form or certification expires or
becomes obsolete or invalid, after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to the Borrower, and from
time to time thereafter if reasonably requested by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent;
unless in any such case any Change in Law has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required that renders any such
form inapplicable or would prevent such Non-U.S. Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Non-U.S. Lender
promptly so advises the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. Each Person that shall become a Participant pursuant to Section 13.6 or a Lender pursuant
to Section 13.6 shall, upon the effectiveness of the related transfer, be required to provide all the forms and statements required pursuant to this
Section 5.4(e); provided that in the case of a Participant such Participant shall furnish all such required forms and statements to the Lender from which the
related participation shall have been purchased.
(f) If any Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, determines, in its sole discretion, that it had received and retained a refund of an Indemnified Tax
or Other Tax for which a payment has been made by the Borrower or any Guarantor pursuant to this Agreement or any other Credit Document, which refund
in the good faith judgment of such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, is attributable to such payment made by the Borrower or any
Guarantor, then such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall reimburse the Borrower or such Guarantor for such amount (net of all out-
of-pocket expenses of
 
73
[CREDIT AGREEMENT]
10-Q
such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, and without interest other than any interest received thereon from the relevant Governmental
Authority with respect to such refund) as such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, determines in its sole discretion to be the proportion of
the refund as will leave it, after such reimbursement, in no better or worse position (taking into account expenses or any taxes imposed on the refund) than it
would have been in if the payment had not been required; provided that the Borrower or such Guarantor, upon the request of such Lender or the
Administrative Agent, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower or such Guarantor (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the
relevant Governmental Authority) to such Lender or the Administrative Agent in the event such Lender or the Administrative Agent is required to repay such
refund to such Governmental Authority. In such event, such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall, at the Borrower’s request, provide
the Borrower with a copy of any notice of assessment or other evidence of the requirement to repay such refund received from the relevant Governmental
Authority (provided that such Lender or the Administrative Agent may delete any information therein that it deems confidential). Each Lender and the
Administrative Agent shall claim any refund that it determines is available to it, unless it concludes in its sole discretion that it would be adversely affected by
making such a claim. No Lender nor the Administrative Agent shall be obliged to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes
that it deems confidential) to any Credit Party in connection with this clause (f) or any other provision of this Section 5.4.
(g) If the Borrower determines that a reasonable basis exists for contesting a Tax, each Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall use
reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower as the Borrower may reasonably request in challenging such Tax. The Borrower shall indemnify and hold
each Lender and the Administrative Agent harmless against any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Person in connection with any request made by
the Borrower pursuant to this Section 5.4(g). Nothing in this Section 5.4(g) shall obligate any Lender or the Administrative Agent to take any action that such
Person, in its sole judgment, determines may result in a material detriment to such Person.
(h) The Administrative Agent and each Lender that is a United States person under Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (each, a “U.S. Lender”) shall deliver to
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two Internal Revenue Service Forms W-9 (or substitute or successor form), properly completed and duly
executed, certifying that such Person is exempt from United States federal backup withholding (i) on or prior to the Closing Date (or on or prior to the date it
becomes a party to this Agreement), (ii) on or before the date that such form expires or becomes obsolete or invalid, (iii) after the occurrence of a change in
Person’s circumstances requiring a change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and (iv) from time
to time thereafter if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent.
(i) If a payment made to any Lender or the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other Credit Document would be subject to U.S. federal
withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Person were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in
Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times
prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower
 
74

10-Q
or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such
additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Person has or has not complied with such Person’s obligations under FATCA or
to determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 5.4(i), “FATCA” shall include any amendments
made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(j) For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Section 5.4, the term “Lender” includes any Letter of Credit Issuer and any Swingline Lender
(k) The agreements in this Section 5.4 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable
hereunder.
5.5 Computations of Interest and Fees.
(a) Except as provided in the next succeeding sentence, interest on Loans and Swingline Loans shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the
actual days elapsed, provided that interest on ABR Loans in respect of which the rate of interest is calculated on the basis of the Administrative Agent’s
prime rate and interest on overdue interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for the actual days elapsed.
(b) Fees and the average daily Stated Amount of Letters of Credit shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed.
5.6 Limit on Rate of Interest.
(a) No Payment Shall Exceed Lawful Rate. Notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement, the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any interest or other
amounts under or in connection with this Agreement or otherwise in respect to any of the Obligations in excess of the amount or rate permitted under or
consistent with any applicable Requirement of Law.
(b) Payment at Highest Lawful Rate. If the Borrower is not obliged to make a payment that it would otherwise be required to make, as a result of
Section 5.6(a), the Borrower shall make such payment to the maximum extent permitted by or consistent with applicable Requirement of Law.
(c) Adjustment if Any Payment Exceeds Lawful Rate. If any provision of this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents would obligate the Borrower or
any other Credit Party to make any payment of interest or other amount payable to any Lender in an amount or calculated at a rate that would be prohibited
by any applicable Requirement of Law, then notwithstanding such provision, such amount or rate shall be deemed to have been adjusted with retroactive
effect to the maximum amount or rate of interest, as the case may be, as would not be so prohibited by applicable Requirements of Law, such adjustment to
be effected, to the extent necessary, by reducing the amount or rate of interest required to be paid by the Borrower to the affected Lender under Section 2.8.
 
75
[CREDIT AGREEMENT]
10-Q
(d) Rebate of Excess Interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and after giving effect to all adjustments contemplated thereby, if any Lender shall have
received from the Borrower an amount in excess of the maximum permitted by any applicable Requirement of Law, then the Borrower shall be entitled, by
notice in writing to the Administrative Agent to obtain reimbursement from that Lender in an amount equal to such excess, and pending such reimbursement,
such amount shall be deemed to be an amount payable by that Lender to the Borrower.

8.3 No Violation. None of the execution, delivery or performance by any Credit Party of the Credit Documents to which it is a party or the compliance with the
terms and provisions thereof will (a) contravene any material applicable provision of any material Requirement of Law, (b) result in any breach of any of the

pursuant to the terms of any indenture, loan agreement, lease agreement, mortgage, deed of trust, agreement or other instrument to which such Credit Party
or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of its property or assets is bound (any such term, covenant, condition or provision, a
“Contractual Requirement”) except to the extent such breach, default or Lien that would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or

Date (including all such information and data contained in the Credit Documents) for purposes of or in connection with this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated herein contained any untrue statement of any material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary to make such information and data
(taken as a whole) not materially misleading at such time (after giving effect to all supplements so furnished prior to such time) in light of the circumstances

and information of a general economic or general industry nature.
(b) The projections (including financial estimates, forecasts and other forward-looking information) contained in the information and data referred to in

Administrative Agent and the Lenders that such projections are as to future events and are not to be viewed as facts, the projections are subject to significant
uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the control of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries, that no assurance can be given that any
particular projections will be realized and that actual results during the period or periods covered by any such projections may differ from the projected results

8.14 Properties. Each Credit Party has good and defensible title to all of its material properties and assets, free and clear of all Liens other than Liens
permitted under Section 10.2 and of all impediments to the use of such properties and assets in such Credit Party’s business, except that no representation

permitted under Section 10.2, each Credit Party will respectively own in the aggregate, in all material respects, the net interests in production attributable to
all material wells and units owned by the Credit Party. The ownership of such properties shall not in the aggregate in any material respect obligate such

Subsidiaries and their respective officers and employees and, to the knowledge of the Authorized Officers of the Borrower, its directors and agents, are in
compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws and applicable Sanctions in all material respects and are not knowingly engaged in any activity that would reasonably

Administrative Agent and the Lenders under this Section 9.2, and (ii) only one such visit shall be at the Borrower’s expense; provided, further, that when an
Event of Default exists, the Administrative Agent (or any of its representatives or independent contractors) or any representative of the Majority Lenders may
do any of the foregoing at the expense of the Borrower at any time during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice. The Administrative
Agent and the Majority Lenders shall give the Borrower the opportunity to participate in any discussions with the Borrower’s independent public accountants.

with insurance companies that the Borrower believes (in the good faith judgment of the management of the Borrower) are financially sound and responsible
at the time the relevant coverage is placed or renewed, insurance in at least such amounts (after giving effect to any self-insurance which the Borrower
believes (in the good faith judgment of management of the Borrower) is reasonable and prudent in light of the size and nature of its business) and against at
least such risks (and with such risk retentions) as the Borrower believes (in the good faith judgment of management of the Borrower) is reasonable and
prudent in light of the size and nature of its business; and will furnish to the Administrative Agent, upon written request from the Administrative Agent,
information presented in reasonable detail as to the insurance so carried.

proceeds of such property insurance to the Borrower to the extent that the Borrower undertakes to apply such proceeds to the reconstruction, replacement or
repair of the property insured thereby. During any Borrowing Base Trigger Period (and only during any

become a material Lien upon any properties of the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries; provided that neither the Borrower nor any of the
Restricted Subsidiaries shall be required to pay or discharge any such tax, assessment, charge, levy or claim that is being contested in good faith and by
proper proceedings if it has maintained adequate reserves (in the good faith judgment of management of the Borrower) with respect thereto to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, GAAP or the failure to pay or discharge would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

Credit Documents in accordance with a request of the Majority Lenders, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be
binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Loans; provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its
opinion or in the opinion of its counsel, may expose it to liability or that is contrary to any Credit Document or applicable Requirements of Law. For purposes
of determining compliance with the conditions specified in Article VI and Article VII on the Closing Date, each Lender that has signed this Agreement shall be
deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter required thereunder to be consented to or
approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from such Lender prior to the proposed
Closing Date specifying its objection thereto.
12.5 Notice of Default. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default
hereunder unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or
Event of Default and stating that such notice is a “notice of default”. In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, it shall give notice
thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the
Majority Lenders in accordance with the terms hereof; provided that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the
Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default
as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.

[CREDIT AGREEMENT]

12.6 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Administrative Agent nor any of their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by the
Administrative Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the Borrower or any other Credit Party, shall be deemed to constitute any
representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent to any Lender, any Swingline Lender or any Letter of Credit Issuer. Each Lender, each Swingline
Lender and each Letter of Credit Issuer acknowledges to the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative
Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the
business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and each other Credit Party and made its own decision to
make its credit extensions hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, and to make such investigation
as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and any
other Credit Party. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder,
the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, assets,
operations, properties, financial condition, prospects or creditworthiness of the Borrower or any other Credit Party that may come into the possession of the
Administrative Agent any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.
12.7 No Other Duties, Etc. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Joint Bookrunners, Joint Lead Arrangers, Co-Syndication Agents or
Co-Documentation Agents listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Credit
Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent, a Lender or a Letter of Credit Issuer hereunder.
12.8 Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Credit Parties and
without limiting the obligation of the Credit Parties to do so), ratably according to their respective portions of the Commitments or Loans, as applicable,
outstanding in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Commitments shall have
terminated and the Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with their respective portions of the Total Exposure in effect immediately prior to
such date), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of
any kind whatsoever that may at any time occur (including at any time following the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against
the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Credit Documents or any documents
contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent
under or in connection with
 
112
[CREDIT AGREEMENT]
10-Q
any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall be liable to the Administrative Agent for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Administrative Agent’s gross negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct as determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction (IT BEING THE INTENTION OF THE PARTIES HERETO THAT
THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND ANY RELATED PARTIES SHALL, IN ALL CASES, BE INDEMNIFIED FOR ITS ORDINARY, COMPARATIVE,
CONTRIBUTORY OR SOLE NEGLIGENCE); provided, further, that no action taken in accordance with the directions of the Majority Lenders (or such other
number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be required by the Credit Documents) shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct for purposes of this Section 12.8. In the case of any investigation, litigation or proceeding giving rise to any liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time occur (including at any time
following the payment of the Loans), this Section 12.8 applies whether any such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any Lender or any other
Person. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the Administrative Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-
pocket expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration,
modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice rendered in respect of rights or
responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Credit Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the
Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Borrower; provided that such reimbursement by the Lenders shall not affect
the Borrower’s continuing reimbursement obligations with respect thereto. If any indemnity furnished to the Administrative Agent for any purpose shall, in the
opinion of the Administrative Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, the Administrative Agent may call for additional indemnity and cease, or not
commence, to do the acts indemnified against until such additional indemnity is furnished; provided, in no event shall this sentence require any Lender to
indemnify the Administrative Agent against any liability, obligation, loss, damage, penalty, action, judgment, suit, cost, expense or disbursement in excess of
such Lender’s pro rata portion thereof; and provided further, this sentence shall not be deemed to require any Lender to indemnify the Administrative Agent
against any liability, obligation, loss, damage, penalty, action, judgment, suit, cost, expense or disbursement resulting from the Administrative Agent gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section 12.8 shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable
hereunder.
12.9 Agent in Its Individual Capacity. The Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind
of business with the Borrower and any other Credit Party as though the Administrative Agent were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the
other Credit Documents. With respect to the Loans made by it, the Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the
other Credit Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the terms “Lender” and “Lenders”
shall include the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity.
12.10 Successor Agent. The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the Swingline Lenders, the Letter of Credit
Issuers and the Borrower.
 
113
[CREDIT AGREEMENT]
10-Q
If the Administrative Agent and/or any Swingline Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then such Administrative Agent or Swingline Lender may be removed
as the Administrative Agent or Swingline Lender, as the case may be, at the reasonable request of the Borrower and the Majority Lenders. Upon receipt of
any such notice of resignation or removal, as the case may be, the Majority Lenders shall have the right, subject to the consent of the Borrower (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) so long as no Event of Default under Section 11.1 or 11.5 is continuing, to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank
with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States but shall not, in any case, be a Defaulting Lender or an
Affiliate of a Defaulting Lender. If, in the case of the resignation of the Administrative Agent, no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Majority
Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the Administrative
Agent may on behalf of the Lenders, the Swingline Lenders and the Letter of Credit Issuers, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the
qualifications set forth above. Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as the Administrative Agent hereunder, and upon the execution and filing
or recording of such financing statements, or amendments thereto, and such other instruments or notices, as may be necessary or desirable, or as the
Majority Lenders may request, in order to continue the perfection of the Liens granted or purported to be granted by the Security Documents (if any), such
successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the
retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Credit Documents (if not already
discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section). The fees payable by the Borrower (following the effectiveness of such appointment) to the
successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.
After the retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder and under the other Credit Documents, the provisions of this Article XII (including
Section 12.8) and Section 13.5 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub agents and their respective Related Parties
in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as the Administrative Agent.
Any resignation of any Person as Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section shall also constitute its resignation as Letter of Credit Issuer and Swingline
Lender (in each case if applicable). Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, (a) such successor shall
succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Letter of Credit Issuer and the retiring Swingline Lender,
(b) the retiring Letter of Credit Issuer and retiring Swingline Lender shall be discharged from all of their respective duties and obligations hereunder or under
the other Credit Documents, and (c) the successor Letter of Credit Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding
at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to the retiring Letter of Credit Issuer to effectively assume the obligations of the
retiring Letter of Credit Issuer with respect to such Letters of Credit.
12.11 Withholding Tax. To the extent required by any applicable Requirement of Law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any
Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax. If the Internal Revenue Service or any authority of the United States or other jurisdiction
asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly
 
114
[CREDIT AGREEMENT]
10-Q
withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because the appropriate form was not delivered, was not properly executed, or because
such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstances that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax
ineffective, or for any other reason), such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent (to the extent that the Administrative Agent has not already been
reimbursed by any applicable Credit Party and without limiting the obligation of any applicable Credit Party to do so) fully for all amounts paid, directly or
indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as Tax or otherwise, including penalties, additions to Tax and interest, together with all expenses incurred, including
legal expenses, allocated staff costs and any out of pocket expenses. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and
all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Credit Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under
this Section 12.11. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Section 12.11, the term “Lender” includes any Letter of Credit Issuer and any Swingline
Lender.
12.12 Security Documents and Guarantee. Each Secured Party hereby further authorizes the Administrative Agent, on behalf of and for the benefit of
Secured Parties, to be the agent for and representative of the Secured Parties with respect to the Collateral and the Security Documents. Subject to
Section 13.1, without further written consent or authorization from any Secured Party, the Administrative Agent may (a) execute any documents or
instruments necessary in connection with a Disposition of assets permitted by this Agreement, (b) release any Lien encumbering any item of Collateral that is
the subject of such Disposition of assets or with respect to which Majority Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required to give such consent under
Section 13.1) have otherwise consented or (c) release any Guarantor from the Guarantee with respect to which Majority Lenders (or such other Lenders as
may be required to give such consent under Section 13.1) have otherwise consented (and, in the case of any automatic release of a Guarantor in accordance
with Section 13.17, execute any documents or instruments that may be necessary or advisable to evidence such release).
12.13 Right to Realize on Collateral and Enforce Guarantee. Anything contained in any of the Credit Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Secured Party hereby agree that (a) no Secured Party shall have any right individually to realize upon any of
the Collateral or to enforce the Guarantee; it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies hereunder may be exercised solely by the
Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties in accordance with the terms hereof and all powers, rights and remedies under the Security
Documents and the Guarantee may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent, and (b) in the event of a foreclosure by the Administrative Agent on any
of the Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale or other disposition, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be the purchaser or licensor of any or all
of such Collateral at any such sale or other disposition and the Administrative Agent, as agent for and representative of the Secured Parties (but not any
Lender or Lenders in its or their respective individual capacities unless Majority Lenders shall otherwise agree in writing) shall be entitled, for the purpose of
bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such public sale, to use and apply any of
the Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for any collateral payable by the Administrative Agent at such sale or other disposition.
 
115
[CREDIT AGREEMENT]
10-Q
12.14 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization,
arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding, constituting an Event of Default under Section 11.5, the Administrative Agent
(irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of
whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or
otherwise:
(a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Obligations that are
owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative
Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their
respective agents and counsel, to the extent due under Section 13.5) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and
(b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each
Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments
directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, to the extent due under Section 13.5.
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any
plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Indebtedness or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the Administrative
Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.

of Hazardous Materials involving or attributable to the operations of the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Oil and Gas Properties (all the
foregoing in this clause (d), collectively, the “Indemnified Liabilities”); provided that the Borrower shall have no obligation hereunder to the Administrative
Agent, any Letter of Credit Issuer or any Lender or any of their respective Related Parties with respect to Indemnified Liabilities to the extent it has been
determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from (i) the gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct of the party to be indemnified or any of its Related Parties (IT BEING THE INTENTION OF THE PARTIES HERETO THAT EACH LENDER,
LETTER OF CREDIT ISSUER AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THEIR RESPECTIVE RELATED PARTIES SHALL, IN ALL CASES, BE
INDEMNIFIED FOR ITS ORDINARY COMPARATIVE, CONTRIBUTORY OR SOLE NEGLIGENCE), (ii) any material breach of any Credit Document by the

foregoing shall not negate the Borrower’s obligations with respect to Indemnified Liabilities. All amounts payable under this Section 13.5 shall be paid within
15 Business Days of receipt by the Borrower of an invoice relating thereto setting forth such expense in reasonable detail. The agreements in this
Section 13.5 shall survive repayment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. This Section 13.5 shall not apply with respect to any claims for
Taxes which shall be governed exclusively by Section 5.4 and, to the extent set forth therein, Sections 2.10 and 3.5. For the avoidance of doubt, the

Section 13.6. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective

(iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to Section 13.6(b)(iv), from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and
Acceptance, the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights
and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender’s
rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.10,
2.11, 3.5, 5.4 and 13.5). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 13.6
shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 13.6(c).
(iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Administrative Agent’s Office a copy of
each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and
principal amount (and stated interest amounts) of the Loans and L/C Obligations and any payment made by the Letter of Credit Issuers under any Letter of
Credit owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”). Further, the Register shall contain the name and address of the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the lending office through which each such Person acts under this Agreement. The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Letter of Credit Issuers and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose
name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the
contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, the Letter of Credit Issuers the Swingline Lenders and, solely with respect to itself,
each other Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee’s completed
Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in Section 13.6(b)
(unless waived) and any written consent to such assignment required by Section 13.6(b), the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and
Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the Register.
(c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, any Swingline Lender or any Letter of Credit Issuer, sell participations
to one or more banks or other entities other than an Ineligible Person (each, a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and obligations under
this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement
shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Letter of Credit Issuer and the other Lenders shall continue to deal
 
123

solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to
which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Credit Document; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such
Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in clauses (i) or (ii) of the proviso to
Section 13.1 that affects such Participant, provided that the Participant shall have no right to consent to any modification to the percentages specified in the
definitions of the terms “Majority Lenders”, “Majority Lenders”, “Required Lenders” or “Borrowing Base Required Lenders”. Subject to Section 13.6(c)(ii), the
Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.10, 2.11, 3.5 and 5.4 to the same extent as if it were a Lender (subject to
the limitations and requirements of those Sections as though it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 13.6(b),
including the requirements of clause (e), (f) and (i) of Section 5.4). To the extent permitted by Requirements of Law, each Participant also shall be entitled to
the benefits of Section 13.8(b) as though it were a Lender; provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 13.8(a) as though it were a Lender.
(ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.10, 2.11, 3.5 or 5.4 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled
to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower’s prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); provided that the Participant shall be subject to the provisions in Section 2.12 as if it
were an assignee under clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 13.6. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary
agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each participant and the principal amounts (and related interest
amounts) of each participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the “Participant Register”). The entries in the Participant
Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the
owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. No Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all
or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any
commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Credit Document) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish
that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.
(d) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Letter of Credit Issuers or the Swingline Lenders at any time pledge or
assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender to a Federal Reserve Bank or any central
bank having jurisdiction over such Lender, and this Section 13.6 shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no
such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for
such Lender as a party hereto.

(e) Subject to Section 13.16, the Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Participant, secured creditor of such Lender or assignee (each, a
“Transferee”) and any prospective Transferee any and all financial information in such Lender’s possession concerning the Borrower and its Affiliates that
has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower and its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement or that has been delivered to such Lender by
or on behalf of the Borrower and its Affiliates in connection with such Lender’s credit evaluation of the Borrower and its Affiliates prior to becoming a party to
this Agreement.
(f) The words “execution,” “signed,” “signature,” and words of like import in any Assignment and Acceptance shall be deemed to include electronic signatures
or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the
use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic
Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the
Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.

(iii) becomes a Defaulting Lender (iv) becomes a Declining Lender, (v) does not consent to any waiver or amendment desired by the Borrower requiring the
consent of all Lenders, the Required Lenders or all Lenders directly affected thereby (so long as the Majority Lenders have consented thereto), (vi) does not
consent to a proposed Borrowing Base pursuant to Section 2.14 (so long as the Majority Lenders, or in the case of any increase in the Borrowing Base, the
Borrowing Base Required Lenders, have consented thereto) or (vii) has failed to fund Loans, participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans or has
made a notification or public statement that it does not intend or expect to comply with its funding obligations hereunder, in each case as a result of its
determination that a condition precedent to funding has not or cannot be satisfied pursuant to the definition of “Lender Default”, in each case, with a
replacement bank, lending institution or other financial institution; provided that (A) such replacement does not conflict with any Requirement of Law, (B) no
Event of Default under Section 11.1 or 11.5 shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, (C) the replacement bank or institution
shall purchase, at par, all Loans and the Borrower shall pay all other amounts (other than any disputed amounts), pursuant to Section 2.10, 3.5 or 5.4, as the
case may be owing to such replaced Lender prior to the date of replacement, (D) the replacement bank or institution shall be subject to the consent of the
Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lenders and the Letter of Credit Issuers (to the extent the consent of such Person would be required if an assignment
were being made to such replacement bank or institution under Section 13.6(b)), (E) the replaced Lender shall be obligated to make such replacement in
accordance with the provisions of Section 13.6(b) (provided that the Borrower shall be obligated to pay the registration and processing fee referred to
therein), and (F) any such replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall
have against the replaced Lender.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each party hereto agrees that any assignment pursuant to the terms of this Section 13.7 may be effected
pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee and that the Lender making such
assignment need not be a party thereto.
13.8 Adjustments; Set-off.
(a) If any Lender (a “Benefited Lender”) shall at any time receive any payment in respect of any principal of or interest on all or part of the Loans made by it, or
the participations in Letters of Credit held by it, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or
proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 11.5, or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other
Lender, if any, in respect of such other Lender’s Loans, or interest thereon, such Benefited Lender shall (i) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and
(ii) purchase for cash at face value from the other Lenders a participating interest in such portion of each such other Lender’s Loans, or shall provide such
other Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such Benefited Lender to share the excess
payment or benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably in accordance with the aggregate principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and
other amounts owing them; provided, however, that, (A) if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such Benefited
Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest and (B) the
provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (1) any payment made by the Borrower or any other Credit Party pursuant to and in
accordance with the express terms of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, (2) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the
assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans, Commitments or participations in Drawings to any assignee or participant or (3) any
disproportionate payment obtained by a Lender as a result of the extension by Lenders of the maturity date or expiration date of some but not all Loans or
Commitments or any increase in the Applicable Margin in respect of Loans or Commitments of Lenders that have consented to any such extension. Each
Credit Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under Requirements of Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation
pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Credit Party rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as
if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Credit Party in the amount of such participation.
(b) After the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, in addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by Requirements of
Law, each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted
by applicable Requirements of Law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by the Borrower hereunder or under any Credit Document (whether at the
stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) to set-off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general or special, time or
demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect,
absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender or any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of
the Borrower. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower (and the Credit Parties, if
 
126
[CREDIT AGREEMENT]
10-Q
applicable) and the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not
affect the validity of such set-off and application.
13.9 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts (including by
facsimile or other electronic transmission, i.e. a “pdf” or a “tif”), and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same
instrument. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the parties shall be lodged with the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.
13.10 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the
extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

(a) The Secured Parties hereby irrevocably agree that the Liens granted to the Administrative Agent by the Credit Parties on any Collateral shall be
automatically released (i) in full, as set forth in clauses (b) or (c) below, (ii) upon the Disposition of such Collateral (including as part of or in connection with
any other Disposition permitted hereunder) to any Person other than another Credit Party, to the extent such Disposition is made in compliance with the
terms of this Agreement (and the Administrative Agent may rely conclusively on a certificate to that effect provided to it by any Credit Party upon its
reasonable request without further inquiry), (iii) to the extent such Collateral is comprised of property leased to a Credit Party, upon termination or expiration
of such lease, (iv) if the release of such Lien is approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Majority Lenders (or such other percentage of the Lenders

Parties in respect of) all interests retained by the Credit Parties, including the proceeds of any Disposition, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the
Collateral to the extent required by the applicable Credit Documents, except to the extent otherwise released in accordance with the provisions of the Credit

Guarantee (i) if such Guarantor became a Guarantor pursuant to Section 10.1(u) and the guarantee provided by such Guarantor is no longer required to be in
compliance after giving effect to such release, with Section 10.1 or (ii) if such Guarantor ceases to be a Material Subsidiary, in each case, promptly upon the
Borrower delivering a request for such release to the Administrative Agent. The Secured Parties hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to (all without the
further consent or joinder of any Secured Party), and the Administrative Agent shall, execute and deliver any instruments, documents, and agreements
necessary or desirable to effect, evidence and/or confirm the release of any Guarantor or Collateral pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph.

longer be deemed to be repeated.
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or any other Credit Document, when all Obligations (other than indemnification and other
contingent obligations for which no claim has been asserted at the relevant time of determination) have been paid in full, all Commitments have terminated or
expired and no Letter of Credit shall be outstanding that is not Cash Collateralized or otherwise back-stopped pursuant arrangements satisfactory to the
applicable Letter of Credit Issuer and the Administrative Agent (such time, “Facility Termination”), all security interests and Liens in all Collateral and all
obligations under all the Credit Documents shall be automatically released and discharged, and the Administrative Agent shall (without notice to, or vote or
consent of, any Secured Party) take such actions as shall be required, advisable or reasonably requested by the Borrower to evidence or otherwise more
fully effect the foregoing, provided, however, that such Obligations shall be reinstated if after such release any portion of any payment in respect of the
Obligations guaranteed thereby shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or
reorganization of the Borrower or any Guarantor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar
officer for, the Borrower or any Guarantor or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or any other Credit Document, upon the Borrower’s election to enter into an Unsecured Period

Credit Parties under the Security Documents shall be automatically released and discharged, and the Administrative Agent shall (without notice to, or vote or
consent of, any Secured Party) take such actions as shall be required, advisable or reasonably requested by the Borrower to evidence or otherwise more
fully effect such release and discharge.
(d) If any Lender determines, acting reasonably, that any applicable law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is
unlawful, for such Lender to hold or benefit from a Lien over real property pursuant to any law of the United States or any State thereof, such Lender may
notify the Administrative Agent and disclaim any benefit of such security interest to the extent of such illegality; provided, that such determination or
disclaimer shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such Lien for the benefit of any other Lender.

13.18 Borrowing Base Election.
(a) At any time that is not a Borrowing Base Trigger Period, the Borrower may provide written notice to the Administrative Agent of its election to enter into a
Borrowing Base Trigger Period. A Borrowing Base Trigger Period will commence upon the Administrative Agent’s receipt of such notice.
(b) At any time during a Borrowing Base Trigger Period, as long as no Borrowing Base Trigger Event has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower may
provide notice to the Administrative Agent of its election to exit such Borrowing Base Trigger Period and enter into an Unsecured Period together with a
certificate of an Authorized Officer of the Borrower confirming that (A) no Event of Default exists and (B) no Borrowing Base Trigger Event has occurred and
is continuing.
13.19 USA PATRIOT Act. The Administrative Agent and each Lender hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act
(Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the “Patriot Act”), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each
Credit Party, which information includes the name and address of each Credit Party and other information that will allow the Administrative Agent and such
Lender to identify each Credit Party in accordance with the Patriot Act.
13.20 Payments Set Aside. To the extent that any payment made by or on behalf of the Borrower is made to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or the
Administrative Agent or any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently
invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent or
such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of
such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had
not been made or such setoff had not occurred, and (b) each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share of
any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at
a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect.
13.21 Reinstatement. This Agreement shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of
the monetary Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the Borrower, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or
trustee or similar officer for, the Borrower or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made.

13.22 Disposition of Proceeds. If executed and delivered, any Security Document may contain an assignment by the applicable Credit Party unto and in
favor of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties of all of such Credit Party’s interest in and to its as-extracted collateral in the form of
production and all proceeds attributable thereto which may be produced from or allocated to the Collateral covered thereby. If executed and delivered, the
Security Documents may further provide in general for the application of such proceeds to the satisfaction of the Obligations described therein and secured
thereby. Notwithstanding the assignment contained in such Security Documents, unless an Event of Default is continuing during a Borrowing Base Trigger
Period, (a) the Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties agree that they will neither notify the purchaser or purchasers of such production nor take any
other action to cause such proceeds to be remitted to the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party, and all such proceeds shall be permitted to be
paid to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and (b) the Secured Parties hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to take such actions as may be necessary to
cause such proceeds to be paid to the Borrower and/or such Subsidiaries.

SECTION II
GUARANTEE
2.1    Guarantee.
(a)    Subject to the provisions of Section 2.1(b), each of the Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally and irrevocably, guarantees to the
Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, the prompt and complete payment and performance when due (whether at the stated
maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the Obligations (including any extensions, modifications, substitutions, amendments and renewals of any or all of
such Obligations).
(b)    Anything herein or in any other Credit Document to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum liability of each Guarantor hereunder and under the other
Credit Documents shall in no event exceed the amount which can be guaranteed by such Guarantor under the Bankruptcy Code or any applicable federal
and state Requirements of Law relating to fraudulent conveyances, fraudulent transfers or the insolvency of debtors.
(c)    To the extent that the Borrower would be required to make payments pursuant to Section 13.5 of the Credit Agreement, each Guarantor further agrees to
pay any and all expenses (including without limitation, all reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that may be paid or incurred by the Administrative
Agent or any other Secured Party in enforcing, or obtaining advice of counsel in respect of, any rights with respect to, or collecting, any or all of the
Obligations and/or enforcing any rights with respect to, or collecting against, such Guarantor under this Guarantee. This Guarantee shall remain in full force
and effect until Facility
10-Q
Termination, notwithstanding that from time to time prior thereto no amounts may be outstanding under the Credit Documents.
(d)    Each Guarantor agrees that the Obligations may at any time and from time to time exceed the amount of the liability of such Guarantor hereunder
without impairing this Guarantee or affecting the rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party hereunder.
(e)    No payment or payments made by the Borrower, any of the Guarantors, any other guarantor or any other Person or received or collected by the
Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party from the Borrower, any Guarantor, any other guarantor or any other Person by virtue of any action or
proceeding or any set-off or appropriation or application at any time or from time to time in reduction of, or in payment of, the Obligations shall be deemed to
modify, reduce, release or otherwise affect the liability of any Guarantor hereunder, which shall, notwithstanding any such payment or payments (other than
payments made by the Borrower or such Guarantor in respect of the Obligations or payments received or collected from such Guarantor in respect of the
Obligations), remain liable for the Obligations up to the maximum liability of such Guarantor hereunder until Facility Termination.
(f)    Each Guarantor agrees that whenever, at any time, or from time to time, it shall make any payment to the Administrative Agent or any other Secured
Party on account of its liability hereunder, it will notify the Administrative Agent in writing that such payment is made under this Guarantee for such purpose.
2.2    Right of Contribution. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that to the extent that a Guarantor shall have paid more than its proportionate share of any
payment made hereunder (including by way of set-off rights being exercised against it), such Guarantor shall be entitled to seek and receive contribution from
and against any other Guarantor hereunder who has not paid its proportionate share of such payment. Each Guarantor’s right of contribution shall be subject
to the terms and conditions of Section 2.4. The provisions of this Section 2.2 shall in no respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor to the
Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, and each Guarantor shall remain liable to the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties for the
full amount guaranteed by such Guarantor hereunder.
2.3    Right of Set-off. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Secured Parties provided by applicable Requirements of Law, each Guarantor hereby
irrevocably authorizes each Secured Party at any time and from time to time following the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default,
without notice to such Guarantor or any other Guarantor, any such notice being expressly waived by each Guarantor, upon any amount becoming due and
payable by such Guarantor hereunder (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), to set-off and appropriate and apply against such amount
any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, but excluding deposits held by such Guarantor as a fiduciary for others), in any
currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or
unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Secured Party to or for the credit or the account of such Guarantor under any Credit Document. Each Secured
Party shall notify such Guarantor and the Administrative Agent promptly of any such set-off and the appropriation and application made
10-Q
by such Secured Party; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and appropriation and application.
2.4    No Subrogation. Notwithstanding any payment or payments made by any of the Guarantors hereunder or any set-off or appropriation or application of
funds of any of the Guarantors by any Secured Party, no Guarantor shall be entitled to be subrogated to any of the rights of the Administrative Agent or any
other Secured Party against the Borrower or any other Guarantor or any collateral security or guarantee or right of offset held by any Secured Party for the
payment of the Obligations until Facility Termination, nor shall any Guarantor seek or be entitled to seek any contribution or reimbursement from the
Borrower or any other Guarantor in respect of payments made by such Guarantor hereunder until Facility Termination. If any amount shall be paid to any
Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time prior to Facility Termination, such amount shall be held by such Guarantor in trust for the
Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, segregated from other funds of such Guarantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Guarantor, be
turned over to the Administrative Agent in the exact form received by such Guarantor (duly indorsed by such Guarantor to the Administrative Agent, if
required), to be applied against the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in such order as required by the terms of the Credit Agreement.
2.5    Amendments, etc. with respect to the Obligations; Waiver of Rights. Except for termination of a Guarantor’s obligations hereunder as provided in
Section 5.14, each Guarantor shall remain obligated hereunder notwithstanding that, without any reservation of rights against any Guarantor and without
notice to or further assent by any Guarantor: (a) any demand for payment of any of the Obligations made by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured
Party may be rescinded by such party and any of the Obligations continued; (b) the Obligations, or the liability of any other party upon or for any part thereof,
or any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed, extended,
amended, modified, accelerated, compromised, waived, surrendered or released by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party (with the consent of
the applicable Credit Parties where required by the terms hereof or thereof); (c) the Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents and any other
documents executed and delivered in connection therewith may be amended, modified, waived, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, in
accordance with the terms of the applicable documents; and (d) any collateral security, guarantee or right of offset at any time held by the Administrative
Agent or any other Secured Party for the payment of the Obligations may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered or released. Neither the Administrative
Agent nor any other Secured Party shall have any obligation to protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien at any time held by it as security for the Obligations
or for this Guarantee or any property subject thereto. When making any demand hereunder against any of the Guarantors, the Administrative Agent or any
other Secured Party may, but shall be under no obligation to, make a similar demand on the Borrower or any other Guarantor or guarantor, and any failure by
the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to make any such demand or to collect any payments from the Borrower or any such other Guarantor or
guarantor or any release of the Borrower or such other Guarantor or guarantor shall not relieve any of the Guarantors in respect of which a demand or
collection is not made or any of the Guarantors not so released of their several obligations or liabilities hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and
remedies, express or implied, or as a matter of law, of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party against any of the Guarantors. For the
10-Q
purposes hereof “demand” shall include the commencement and continuance of any legal proceedings.
2.6    Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional. Each Guarantor waives any and all notice of the creation, contraction, incurrence, renewal, extension,
amendment, waiver or accrual of any of the Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party upon this
Guarantee or acceptance of this Guarantee, the Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred, or
renewed, extended, amended, waived or accrued, in reliance upon this Guarantee. All dealings between the Borrower and any of the Guarantors, on the one
hand, and the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, on the other hand, likewise shall be conclusively presumed to have been had or
consummated in reliance upon this Guarantee. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Requirement of Law, each Guarantor waives diligence,
presentment, protest, demand for payment and notice of default or nonpayment to, or upon, the Borrower or any other Guarantor with respect to the
Obligations. Each Guarantor understands and agrees that this Guarantee shall be construed as a continuing, absolute and unconditional guarantee of
payment without regard to (a) the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document, any of the Obligations or any
other collateral security therefor or guarantee or right of offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to time held by the Administrative Agent or any
other Secured Party, (b) any defense, set-off or counterclaim (other than a defense of payment or performance) which may at any time be available to or be
asserted by the Borrower against the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party, or (c) any other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or
knowledge of the Borrower or such Guarantor) which constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of the Credit Parties for
the Obligations, or of such Guarantor under this Guarantee, in bankruptcy or in any other instance (other than a defense of payment or performance). When
pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder against any Guarantor, the Administrative Agent and any other Secured Party may, but shall be under no
obligation to, pursue such rights and remedies as it may have against the Borrower or any other Person or against any collateral security or guarantee for the
Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to pursue such other rights or
remedies or to collect any payments from the Borrower or any such other Person or to realize upon any such collateral security or guarantee or to exercise
any such right of offset, or any release of the Borrower or any such other Person or any such collateral security, guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve
such Guarantor of any liability hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of
the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties against such Guarantor. Each Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and
indirect benefits from financing arrangements contemplated by the Credit Documents and the waivers set forth herein are knowingly made in contemplation
of such benefits. This Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and be binding in accordance with and to the extent of its terms upon each Guarantor
and the successors and assigns thereof, and shall inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, and their respective
successors, indorses, transferees and assigns, until Facility Termination, notwithstanding that from time to time any Credit Documents may be free from any
Obligations. A Guarantor shall automatically be released from its obligations hereunder and the Guarantee of such Guarantor shall be automatically released
under the circumstances described in Section 13.17 of the Credit Agreement.
10-Q
2.7    Reinstatement. This Guarantee shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of
the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the Borrower or any Guarantor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or
conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, the Borrower or any Guarantor or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payments
had not been made.
2.8    Payments. Each Guarantor hereby guarantees that payments hereunder will be paid to the Administrative Agent without set-off or counterclaim in
Dollars at the office of the Administrative Agent located at the address specified in Section 13.2 of the Credit Agreement or such other office as may be
specified from time to time by the Administrative Agent as its funding office by written notice to the Borrower and the Lenders. Each Guarantor agrees that the
provisions of Sections 5.4 and 13.20 of the Credit Agreement shall apply to such Guarantor’s obligations under this Guarantee.
SECTION III
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
3.1    Representations and Warranties. Each Guarantor represents and warrants on the Closing Date and on each other date as required by the Credit
Agreement that the representations and warranties set forth in Article 8 of the Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents to which such Guarantor is a
party, insofar as they relate to such Guarantor, each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference, are true and correct in all material respects on and
as of such date (except where such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties
shall have been true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date), and the Administrative Agent and each Secured Party shall be entitled to
rely on each of them as if they were fully set forth herein.
SECTION IV
COVENANTS
4.1    Covenants. Each Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees with the Administrative Agent and each other Secured Party that, from and after the date of
this Guarantee until Facility Termination, such Guarantor shall take, or shall refrain from taking, as the case may be, each action that is necessary to be taken
or not taken, as the case may be, so that no Default or Event of Default is caused by the failure to take such action or to refrain from taking such action by
such Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries.
4.2    Authority of Administrative Agent. Each Guarantor acknowledges that the rights and responsibilities of the Administrative Agent under this Guarantee
with respect to any action taken by the Administrative Agent or the exercise or non-exercise by the Administrative Agent of any option, right, request,
judgment or other right or remedy provided for herein or resulting or arising out of this Guarantee shall, as between the Administrative Agent and the other
Secured Parties, be governed by the Credit Agreement and by such other agreements with respect thereto as may exist from time to time among them, but,
as between the Administrative Agent and such Guarantor, the Administrative Agent shall be conclusively presumed to be acting as agent for the
10-Q
Secured Parties with full and valid authority so to act or refrain from acting in the manner set forth in Article 12 of the Credit Agreement, and no Guarantor
shall be under any obligation, or entitlement, to make any inquiry respecting such authority.
SECTION V
MISCELLANEOUS
5.1    Notices. All notices, requests and demands pursuant hereto shall be made in accordance with Section 13.2 of the Credit Agreement. All
communications and notices hereunder to any Guarantor shall be given to it in care of the Borrower at the Borrower’s address set forth in Section 13.2 of the
Credit Agreement.
5.2    Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and warranties made hereunder, in the other Credit Documents and in any document,
certificate or statement delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith shall survive the execution and delivery of this Guarantee and the making of the
Loans.
5.3    Counterparts. This Guarantee may be executed by one or more of the parties to this Guarantee on any number of separate counterparts (including by

instrument. A set of the copies of this Guarantee signed by all the parties shall be lodged with the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.
5.4    Severability. Any provision of this Guarantee that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the
extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. The parties hereto shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations
to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provisions.
5.5    Integration. This Guarantee and the other Credit Documents represent the agreement of the Guarantors, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and there are no promises, undertakings, representations or warranties by the Guarantors, the Administrative
Agent nor any Lender relative to subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein or in the other Credit Documents.
5.6    Section Headings. The Section headings used in this Guarantee are for convenience of reference only and are not to affect the construction hereof or
be taken into consideration in the interpretation hereof.
5.7    GOVERNING LAW. THIS GUARANTEE AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY,
AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

(c)    agrees that service of process in any such action or proceeding may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail (or any
substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to such Guarantor at its address as provided in Section 5.1 or at such other address of which the

(d)    agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect service of process in any other manner permitted by Requirements of Law or shall limit the right
to sue in any other jurisdiction;

THEREIN.
10-Q
5.11    Amendments in Writing; No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies.

executed by the affected Guarantor(s) and the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 13.1 of the Credit Agreement.
(b)    Neither the Administrative Agent nor any other Secured Party shall by any act (except by a written instrument pursuant to Section 5.11(a), delay,
indulgence, omission or otherwise be deemed to have waived any right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any Default or Event of Default or in
any breach of any of the terms and conditions hereof. No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of the Administrative Agent or any other
Secured Party, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy,
power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. A waiver by the
Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy
which the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party would otherwise have on any future occasion.

rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

delivery by such Subsidiary of a supplement in the form of Annex A hereto or such other form reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (each, an
“Assumption Agreement”). The execution and delivery of any instrument adding an additional Guarantor as a party to this Guarantee shall not require the
consent of any other Guarantor hereunder. The rights and obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the
addition of any new Guarantor as a party to this Guarantee.
5.14    Termination or Release.
(a)    This Guarantee shall automatically terminate upon Facility Termination.
(b)    A Guarantor shall automatically be released from its obligations hereunder upon the consummation of any transaction permitted by the Credit
Agreement as a result of which such Guarantor ceases to be required to be a Guarantor or as otherwise contemplated by Section 13.17 of the Credit
Agreement.
10-Q

(d)    The Mortgagee shall not be liable for any delay, neglect or failure to effect collection of any proceeds or to take any other action in connection therewith
or hereunder; but the Mortgagee shall have the right, at its election, in the name of the Trustor or otherwise, to prosecute and defend any and all actions or
legal proceedings deemed advisable by the Mortgagee in order to collect such funds and to protect the interests of the Mortgagee and/or the Trustor, with all
costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees incurred in connection therewith being paid by the Trustor.
(e)    The Trustor hereby appoints the Mortgagee as its attorney-in-fact to pursue any and all rights of the Trustor to Liens in the Hydrocarbons securing
payment of proceeds of runs attributable to the Hydrocarbons. In addition to the Liens granted to the Trustee and/or the Mortgagee in Section 2.01(e), the
Trustor hereby further transfers and assigns to the Mortgagee any and all such Liens, security interests, financing statements or similar interests of the Trustor
attributable to its interest in the As-Extracted Collateral, any other Hydrocarbons and proceeds of runs therefrom arising under or created by said statutory
provision, judicial decision or otherwise. The power of attorney granted to the Mortgagee in this Section 3.01, being coupled with an interest, shall be
irrevocable until Facility Termination.
(f)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, until such time as an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Mortgagee hereby
grants to the Trustor a license to sell, receive and give receipt for proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons, and Trustor shall have the right to collect all
revenues and proceeds attributable to the Hydrocarbons that accrue to the Oil and Gas Properties or the products obtained or processed therefrom, as well
as any Liens and security interests security any sales of said Hydrocarbons and to retain, use and enjoy same, provided, that such license shall
automatically terminate upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and shall be terminated for so
9
10-Q
long as the same continues. For the avoidance of doubt, if the foregoing license is terminated as a result of an occurrence of an Event of Default, such
license shall be automatically reinstated if such Event of Default is cured or waived pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement.
Section 3.02    No Modification of Payment Obligations. Nothing herein contained shall modify or otherwise alter the obligation of the Borrower to make
prompt payment of all amounts constituting Secured Obligations when and as the same become due regardless of whether the proceeds of the As-Extracted
Collateral and Hydrocarbons are sufficient to pay the same and the rights provided in accordance with the foregoing assignment provision shall be
cumulative of all other security of any and every character now or hereafter existing to secure payment of the Secured Obligations. Nothing in this Article III is
intended to be an acceptance of collateral in satisfaction of the Secured Obligations.
Section 3.03    Excluded Property. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article III to the contrary, the security interest granted to the Mortgagee
pursuant to this Article III shall not extend to any Excluded Property.
ARTICLE IV
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS
The Trustor hereby represents, warrants and covenants as follows:
Section 4.01    Title. To the extent of the undivided interests specified on Exhibit A, the Trustor has good and defensible title to and is possessed of its
material Hydrocarbon Interests and has good title to its material UCC Collateral (in each case, except to the extent Disposed of in compliance with the Credit
Agreement). The Collateral is free of all Liens except Permitted Encumbrances.
Section 4.02    Defend Title. This Deed of Trust is, and always will be kept, a direct first priority Lien upon the Collateral other than as permitted pursuant to
the Credit Agreement; provided that no intent to subordinate the priority of the Liens created hereby is intended or inferred. The Trustor will not create or
suffer to be created or permit to exist any Lien, security interest or charge prior or junior to or on a parity with the Lien of this Deed of Trust upon the Collateral
or any part thereof other than Permitted Encumbrances. The Trustor will warrant and defend the title to the Collateral against the claims and demands of all
other Persons whomsoever and will maintain and preserve the Lien created hereby (and its priority) until Facility Termination. If (i) an adverse claim be made
against or, a cloud develops upon, the title to any part of the Collateral other than a Permitted Encumbrance or (ii) any Person, including the holder of a
Permitted Encumbrance, shall challenge the priority or validity of the Liens created by this Deed of Trust, then the Trustor agrees to immediately defend
against such adverse claim, take commercially reasonable action to remove such cloud or subordinate such Permitted Encumbrance, in each case, at the
Trustor’s sole cost and expense. The Trustor further agrees that the Trustee and/or the Mortgagee may take such other action as they reasonably deem
advisable to protect and preserve their interests in the Collateral, and in such event the Trustor will indemnify the Trustee and the Mortgagee against any and
all cost, reasonable attorneys’ fees and other expenses which they may incur in defending against any such adverse claim or taking action to remove any
such cloud in accordance with Section 13.5 of the Credit Agreement.
Section 4.03    Not a Foreign Person. The Trustor is not a “foreign person” within the meaning of the Code, Sections 1445 and 7701 (i.e. the Trustor is not a
non-resident alien, foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust or foreign estate as those terms are defined in the Code and any regulations
promulgated thereunder).
10
10-Q
Section 4.04    Power to Create Lien and Security. The Trustor has full power and lawful authority to grant, bargain, sell, assign, transfer, mortgage and
convey a security interest in all of the Collateral in the manner and form herein provided. No authorization, approval, consent or waiver of any lessor,
sublessor, Governmental Authority or other party or parties whomsoever is required in connection with the execution and delivery by the Trustor of this Deed
of Trust.
Section 4.05    Revenue and Cost Bearing Interest. The Trustor’s ownership of the Hydrocarbon Interests and the undivided interests therein as specified on
Exhibit A will, after giving full effect to all Permitted Encumbrances, afford the Trustor not materially less than those net interests (expressed as a fraction,
percentage or decimal) in the production from or which is allocated to such Hydrocarbon Interest specified as Net Revenue Interest on attached Exhibit A
and will cause the Trustor to bear not materially more than that portion (expressed as a fraction, percentage or decimal), specified as Working Interest on
Exhibit A, of the costs of maintaining, developing and operating the wells identified on Exhibit A except to the extent of any proportionate corresponding
increase in the Net Revenue Interest.
Section 4.06    Operation By Third Parties. If any portion of the Deed of Trust Property is comprised of interests which are not working interests or which are
not operated by the Trustor or one of its Affiliates, then with respect to such interests and properties, the Trustor’s covenants as expressed in this Article III are
modified to require that the Trustor use reasonable commercial efforts to obtain compliance with such covenants by the working interest owners or the
operator or operators of such Deed of Trust Properties.
Section 4.07    Failure to Perform. The Trustor agrees that if it fails to perform any act or to take any action which it is required to perform or take hereunder,
upon ten (10) Business Days’ prior notice to the Trustor (other than the payment of monies), or pay any money which the Trustor is required to pay
hereunder, each of the Mortgagee and the Trustee, in the Trustor’s name or its or their own name, may, but shall not be obligated to, perform or cause to
perform such act or take such action or pay such money, and any expenses so incurred by either of them and any money so paid by either of them shall be a
demand obligation owing by the Trustor to the Mortgagee or the Trustee, as the case may be, and each of the Mortgagee and the Trustee, upon making such
payment, shall be subrogated to all of the rights of the Person receiving such payment. Each amount due and owing by the Trustor to each of the Mortgagee
and the Trustee pursuant to this Deed of Trust shall bear interest from the date of such expenditure or payment to such Person until paid at the Post-Default
Rate.
ARTICLE V
RIGHTS AND REMEDIES

with foreclosure by directing the Trustee to proceed, with foreclosure and to sell all or any portion of such Deed of Trust Property at one or more sales, as an
entirety or in parcels, at such place or places in otherwise such manner and upon such notice as may be required by law, or, in the absence of any such

10-Q

thereof by private sale if and to the extent that such private sale is permitted under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction or by public or private sale after entry
of a judgment by any court of competent jurisdiction so ordering. The Trustor hereby irrevocably appoints the Trustee and the Mortgagee, with full power of
substitution, to be the attorneys-in-fact of the Trustor and in the name and on behalf of the Trustor to execute and deliver any deeds, transfers, conveyances,
assignments, assurances and notices which the Trustor ought to execute and deliver and do and perform any and all such acts and things which the Trustor
ought to do and perform under the covenants herein contained and generally, to use the name of the Trustor in the exercise of all or any of the powers hereby
conferred on the Trustee and/or the Mortgagee; provided that, neither the Trustee nor the Mortgagee shall exercise any such powers unless an Event of
Default shall have occurred and is continuing. At any such sale: (i) whether made under the power herein contained or any other legal enactment, or by virtue
of any judicial proceedings or any other legal right, remedy or recourse, it shall not be necessary for the Trustee or the Mortgagee, as appropriate, to have
physically present, or to have constructive possession of, the Deed of Trust Property (the Trustor hereby covenanting and agreeing to deliver to the Trustee
any portion of the Deed of Trust Property not actually or constructively possessed by the Trustee or the Mortgagee immediately upon his or its demand) and
the title to and right of possession of any such property shall pass to the purchaser thereof as completely as if the same had been actually present and
delivered to purchaser at such sale, (ii) each instrument of conveyance executed by the Trustee or the Mortgagee shall contain a general warranty of title,
binding upon the Trustor and its successors and assigns, (iii) each and every recital contained in any instrument of conveyance made by the Trustee or the
Mortgagee shall conclusively establish the truth and accuracy of the matters recited therein, including, without limitation, nonpayment of the Secured
Obligations, advertisement and conduct of such sale in the manner provided herein and otherwise by law and appointment of any successor trustee
hereunder, (iv) any and all prerequisites to the validity thereof shall be conclusively presumed to have been performed, (v) the receipt of the Trustee, the
Mortgagee or of such other party or officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers for its purchase money and no such
purchaser or purchasers, or its assigns or personal representatives, shall thereafter be obligated to see to the application of such purchase money, or be in
any way answerable for any loss, misapplication or nonapplication thereof, (vi) to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Trustor shall be completely and
irrevocably divested of all of its right, title, interest, claim and demand whatsoever, either at law or in equity, in and to the property sold and such sale shall be
a perpetual bar both at law and in equity against the Trustor, and against any and all other persons claiming or to claim the property sold or any part thereof,
by, through or under the Trustor, and (vii) to the extent and under such circumstances as are permitted by law, the Mortgagee may be a purchaser at any such
sale, and shall have the right, after paying or accounting for all costs of said sale or sales, to credit the amount of the bid upon the amount of the Secured
Obligations (in the order of priority set forth in Section 5.14) in lieu of cash payment.
(b)    If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, then (i) the Mortgagee shall be entitled to all of the rights, powers and remedies afforded a secured
party by the Applicable UCC with reference to the UCC Collateral or (ii) the Trustee or the Mortgagee may proceed as to any Collateral in accordance with
the rights and remedies granted under this Deed of Trust or applicable law in respect of the Collateral. Such rights, powers and remedies shall be cumulative
and in addition to those granted to the Trustee or the Mortgagee under any other provision of this Deed of Trust or under any other Loan Document or any
Secured Transaction Document. Written notice mailed to the Trustor as provided herein at least ten (10) days prior to the date of public sale of any part of the
Collateral which is personal property subject to the provisions of the Applicable UCC, or prior to the date after which private sale of any such part of the
Collateral will be made, shall constitute reasonable notice.
Section 5.03    Substitute Trustees and Agents. The Trustee or Mortgagee may appoint or delegate any one or more persons as agent to perform any act or
acts necessary or incident to any sale
12
10-Q
held by the Trustee or Mortgagee, including the posting of notices and the conduct of sale, but in the name and on behalf of the Trustee or Mortgagee. If the
Trustee or Mortgagee shall have given notice of sale hereunder, any successor or substitute trustee or mortgagee agent thereafter appointed may complete
the sale and the conveyance of the property pursuant thereto as if such notice had been given by the successor or substitute trustee or mortgagee agent
conducting the sale.
Section 5.04    Judicial Foreclosure; Receivership. If any of the Secured Obligations shall become due and payable and shall not be promptly paid and, as a
result, an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee or the Mortgagee shall have the right and power to proceed by a suit or suits in
equity or at law, whether for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement herein contained or in aid of the execution of any power herein granted,
or for any foreclosure hereunder or for the sale of the Collateral under the judgment or decree of any court or courts of competent jurisdiction, or for the
appointment of a receiver pending any foreclosure hereunder or the sale of the Collateral under the order of a court or courts of competent jurisdiction or
under executory or other legal process, or for the enforcement of any other appropriate legal or equitable remedy. Any money advanced by the Trustee
and/or the Mortgagee in connection with any such receivership shall be a demand obligation (which obligation the Trustor hereby expressly promises to pay)
owing by the Trustor to the Trustee and/or the Mortgagee and shall bear interest from the date of making such advance by the Trustee and/or the Mortgagee
until paid at the Post-Default Rate.
Section 5.05    Foreclosure for Installments. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Mortgagee shall also have the option to proceed
with foreclosure in satisfaction of any installments of the Secured Obligations which have not been paid when due either through the courts or by directing
the Trustee to proceed with foreclosure in satisfaction of the matured but unpaid portion of the Secured Obligations as if under a full foreclosure, conducting
the sale as herein provided and without declaring the entire principal balance and accrued interest and other Secured Obligations then due; such sale may
be made subject to the unmatured portion of the Secured Obligations, and any such sale shall not in any manner affect the unmatured portion of the Secured
Obligations, but as to such unmatured portion of the Secured Obligations this Deed of Trust shall remain in full force and effect just as though no sale had
been made hereunder. It is further agreed that several sales may be made hereunder without exhausting the right of sale for any unmatured part of the
Secured Obligations, it being the purpose hereof to provide for a foreclosure and sale of the security for any matured portion of the Secured Obligations
without exhausting the power to foreclose and sell the Deed of Trust Property for any subsequently maturing portion of the Secured Obligations.
Section 5.06    Separate Sales. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, then the Collateral may be sold in one or more parcels and to
the extent permitted by applicable law in such manner and order as the Mortgagee, in its sole discretion, may elect, it being expressly understood and agreed
that the right of sale arising out of any Event of Default shall not be exhausted by any one or more sales.
Section 5.07    Possession of Deed of Trust Property. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, then, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, the Trustee or the Mortgagee shall have the right and power to enter into and upon and take possession of all or any part of the Collateral in the
possession of the Trustor, its successors or assigns, or its or their agents or servants, and may exclude the Trustor, its successors or assigns, and all persons
claiming under the Trustor, and its or their agents or servants wholly or partly therefrom; and, holding the same, the Mortgagee may use, administer, manage,
operate and control the Collateral and conduct the business thereof to the same extent as the Trustor, its successors or assigns, might at the time do and may
exercise all rights and powers of the Trustor, in the name, place and stead of the Trustor, or otherwise as the Mortgagee shall deem best. All costs, expenses
and liabilities of every character incurred by the Trustee and/or the Mortgagee in administering,
13
10-Q
managing, operating, and controlling the Deed of Trust Property shall constitute a demand obligation (which obligation the Trustor hereby expressly
promises to pay) owing by the Trustor to the Trustee and/or the Mortgagee and shall bear interest from date of expenditure until paid at the Post-Default Rate.
Section 5.08    Occupancy After Foreclosure. In the event there is a foreclosure sale hereunder and at the time of such sale the Trustor or the Trustor’s heirs,
devisees, representatives, successors or assigns or any other person claiming any interest in the Collateral by, through or under the Trustor, are occupying
or using any Deed of Trust Property or any part thereof, each and all shall immediately become the tenant of the purchaser at such sale, which tenancy shall
be a tenancy from day to day, terminable at the will of either the landlord or tenant, or at a reasonable rental per day based upon the value of the property
occupied, such rental to be due daily to the purchaser; to the extent permitted by applicable law, the purchaser at such sale shall, notwithstanding any
language herein apparently to the contrary, have the sole option to demand immediate possession following the sale or to permit the occupants to remain as
tenants at will. In the event the tenant fails to surrender possession of said property upon demand, the purchaser shall be entitled to institute and maintain a
summary action for possession of the Deed of Trust Property (such as an action for forcible entry and detainer) in any court having jurisdiction.
Section 5.09    Remedies Cumulative, Concurrent and Nonexclusive. Every right, power, privilege and remedy herein given to the Trustee or the Mortgagee
shall be cumulative and in addition to every other right, power and remedy herein specifically given or now or hereafter existing in equity, at law or by statute
(including specifically those granted by the Applicable UCC in effect and applicable to the Collateral or any portion thereof). Each and every right, power,
privilege and remedy whether specifically herein given or otherwise existing may be exercised from time to time and so often and in such order as may be
deemed expedient by the Trustee or the Mortgagee, and the exercise, or the beginning of the exercise, or the abandonment, of any such right, power,
privilege or remedy shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to exercise, at the same time or thereafter any other right, power, privilege or remedy. No delay
or omission by the Trustee or the Mortgagee or any Other Secured Person in the exercise of any right, power or remedy shall impair any such right, power,
privilege or remedy or operate as a waiver thereof or of any other right, power, privilege or remedy then or thereafter existing.
Section 5.10    Discontinuance of Proceedings. If the Trustee or the Mortgagee shall have proceeded to invoke any right, remedy or recourse permitted
hereunder or under any Secured Transaction Document or available at law and shall thereafter elect to discontinue or abandon same for any reason, then it
shall have the unqualified right so to do and, in such an event, the parties shall be restored to their former positions with respect to the Secured Obligations,
this Deed of Trust, the Credit Agreement, the Collateral and otherwise, and the rights, remedies, recourses and powers of the Trustee and the Mortgagee, as
applicable, shall continue as if same had never been invoked.
Section 5.11    No Release of Obligations. Neither the Trustor, any other Credit Party nor any other person hereafter obligated for payment of all or any part of
the Secured Obligations shall be relieved of such obligation by reason of: (a) the failure of the Trustee to comply with any request of the Trustor, any other
Credit Party or any other Person so obligated, to foreclose the Lien of this Deed of Trust or to enforce any provision hereunder or under the Credit
Agreement; (b) the release, regardless of consideration, of the Deed of Trust Property or any portion thereof or interest therein or the addition of any other
property to the Deed of Trust Property; (c) any agreement or stipulation between any subsequent owner of the Deed of Trust Property and the Mortgagee
extending, renewing, rearranging or in any other way modifying the terms of this Deed of Trust without first having obtained the consent of, given notice to or
paid any consideration to the Trustor, any other Credit Party or such other Person, and in such event the Trustor, such other Credit Party and all such other
Persons shall continue to be liable to make payment according to the terms of any such extension or modification agreement unless expressly
14
10-Q
released and discharged in writing by the Mortgagee; or (d) by any other act or occurrence save and except for Facility Termination.
Section 5.12    Release of and Resort to Collateral. The Mortgagee may release, regardless of consideration, any part of the Collateral without, as to the
remainder, in any way impairing, affecting, subordinating or releasing the Lien created in or evidenced by this Deed of Trust or its stature as a first and prior
Lien in and to the Collateral (to the extent contemplated by this Deed of Trust), and without in any way releasing or diminishing the liability of any Person
liable for the repayment of the Secured Obligations. For payment of the Secured Obligations, the Mortgagee may resort to any other security therefor held by
the Mortgagee or the Trustee in such order and manner as the Mortgagee may elect.
Section 5.13    Waiver of Redemption, Notice and Marshalling of Assets, Etc. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Trustor hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and releases (a) all benefits that might accrue to the Trustor by virtue of any present or future moratorium law or other law exempting
the Collateral from attachment, levy or sale on execution or providing for any appraisement, valuation, stay of execution, exemption from civil process,
redemption or extension of time for payment; (b) all notices of any Event of Default or of the Mortgagee’s or any other secured Person’s intention to
accelerate maturity of the Secured Obligations or of any election to exercise or any actual exercise of any right, remedy or recourse provided for hereunder or
under any Secured Transaction Document or available at law; and (c) any right to a marshalling of assets or a sale in inverse order of alienation. If any law
referred to in this Deed of Trust and now in force, of which the Trustor or its successor or successors might take advantage despite the provisions hereof,
shall hereafter be repealed or cease to be in force, such law shall thereafter be deemed not to constitute any part of the contract herein contained or to
preclude the operation or application of the provisions hereof. If the laws of any state which provides for a redemption period do not permit the redemption
period to be waived, the redemption period shall be specifically reduced to the minimum amount of time allowable by statute.
Section 5.14    Application of Proceeds. The proceeds of any sale of the Deed of Trust Property or any part thereof and all other monies received by the
Trustee or the Mortgagee in any proceedings for the enforcement hereof or otherwise, whose application has not elsewhere herein been specifically
provided for, shall be applied:
(a)    First, to the payment of all reasonable expenses incurred by the Trustee or the Mortgagee incident to the enforcement of this Deed of Trust, the Credit
Agreement or any Secured Transaction Document to collect any portion of the Secured Obligations (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
expenses of any entry or taking of possession, of any sale, of advertisement thereof, and of conveyances, and court costs, compensation of agents and
employees, legal fees and a reasonable commission to the Trustee acting, if applicable), and to the payment of all other reasonable charges, expenses,
liabilities and advances incurred or made by the Trustee or the Mortgagee under this Deed of Trust or in executing any trust or power hereunder; and
(b)    Second, as set forth in Article XI of the Credit Agreement.
Section 5.15    Resignation of Operator. In addition to all rights and remedies under this Deed of Trust, at law and in equity, if any Event of Default shall occur
and be continuing and the Trustee or the Mortgagee shall exercise any remedies under this Deed of Trust with respect to any portion of the Deed of Trust
Property (or the Trustor shall transfer any Deed of Trust Property “in lieu of” foreclosure) whereupon the Trustor is divested of its title to any of the Collateral,
the Mortgagee shall have the right to request that any operator of any Deed of Trust Property which is either the Trustor or any Affiliate of the Trustor to resign
as operator under the joint operating agreement applicable thereto, and no later than 60
15
10-Q
days after receipt by the Trustor of any such request, the Trustor shall resign (or cause such other Person to resign) as operator of such Collateral.
Section 5.16    Indemnity. THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE, IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ACTION TAKEN, FOR ANY LOSS
SUSTAINED BY THE TRUSTOR RESULTING FROM AN ASSERTION THAT THE MORTGAGEE HAS RECEIVED FUNDS FROM THE PRODUCTION
OF HYDROCARBONS CLAIMED BY THIRD PERSONS OR ANY ACT OR OMISSION OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY IN ADMINISTERING, MANAGING,
OPERATING OR CONTROLLING THE DEED OF TRUST PROPERTY INCLUDING SUCH LOSS WHICH MAY RESULT FROM THE ORDINARY
NEGLIGENCE OF AN INDEMNIFIED PARTY UNLESS SUCH LOSS IS CAUSED BY THE WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, BAD FAITH OR GROSS
NEGLIGENCE OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY SEEKING INDEMNITY. NO INDEMNIFIED PARTY SHALL BE OBLIGATED TO PERFORM OR
DISCHARGE ANY OBLIGATION, DUTY OR LIABILITY OF THE TRUSTOR. THE TRUSTOR SHALL AND DOES HEREBY AGREE TO INDEMNIFY
EACH INDEMNIFIED PARTY FOR, AND TO HOLD EACH INDEMNIFIED PARTY HARMLESS FROM, ANY AND ALL LIABILITY, LOSS OR DAMAGE
WHICH MAY OR MIGHT BE INCURRED BY ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY BY REASON OF THIS DEED OF TRUST OR THE EXERCISE OF RIGHTS OR
REMEDIES HEREUNDER UNLESS SUCH LIABILITY, LOSS OR DAMAGE IS CAUSED BY THE WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, BAD FAITH OR GROSS
NEGLIGENCE OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY SEEKING INDEMNITY. IF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY SHALL MAKE ANY EXPENDITURE ON
ACCOUNT OF ANY SUCH LIABILITY, LOSS OR DAMAGE, THE AMOUNT THEREOF, INCLUDING COSTS, EXPENSES AND REASONABLE
ATTORNEYS’ FEES, SHALL BE A DEMAND OBLIGATION (WHICH OBLIGATION THE TRUSTOR HEREBY EXPRESSLY PROMISES TO PAY) OWING
BY THE TRUSTOR TO SUCH INDEMNIFIED PARTY AND SHALL BEAR INTEREST FROM THE DATE EXPENDED UNTIL PAID AT THE POST-
DEFAULT RATE. THE TRUSTOR HEREBY ASSENTS TO, RATIFIES AND CONFIRMS ANY AND ALL ACTIONS OF EACH INDEMNIFIED PARTY
WITH RESPECT TO THE DEED OF TRUST PROPERTY TAKEN UNDER AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS DEED OF TRUST. THE
LIABILITIES OF THE TRUSTOR AS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 5.16 SHALL SURVIVE THE TERMINATION OF THIS DEED OF TRUST.

Section 6.01    Duties, Rights, and Powers of Trustee. The Trustee shall have no duty to see to any recording, filing or registration of this Deed of Trust or any
other instrument in addition or supplemental thereto, or to give any notice thereof, or to see to the payment of or be under any duty in respect of any tax or

administration of the duties hereunder, the Mortgagee may appoint multiple trustees to serve in such capacity or in such jurisdictions as the Mortgagee may
designate.
Section 6.03    Retention of Moneys. All moneys received by the Trustee shall, until used or applied as herein provided, be held in trust for the purposes for
