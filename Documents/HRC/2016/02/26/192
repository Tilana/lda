<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
</p>
<p>executions analyses the steps taken by India to implement the recommendations contained 
</p>
<p>in the report made following his visit to the country from 19 to 30 March 2012. During that 
</p>
<p>visit, the Special Rapporteur documented extrajudicial killings by security officers, the 
</p>
<p>State Police, Armed Forces and armed groups. He also reported killings related to 
</p>
<p>communal violence and practices affecting women&#8217;s right to life as a serious problem in 
</p>
<p>some areas of the country. In addition, he noted a number of challenges at various stages of 
</p>
<p>the accountability process leading to impunity in many instances. 
</p>
<p>Since the visit, the Government has taken some steps to address human rights 
</p>
<p>violations committed against women and in support of victims of terrorist-related activities. 
</p>
<p>However, vulnerable groups remain at risk of violent and often lethal attacks. Impunity 
</p>
<p>remains a serious challenge, as does the implementation of existing guidelines and 
</p>
<p>directives issued by the courts and national human rights institution. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur urges the Government to implement the recommendations contained in the visit 
</p>
<p>report insofar as this has not been done.

<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions conducted 
</p>
<p>a country visit to India from 19 to 30 March 2012. He presented his country visit report to 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights Council at its twenty-third session (A/HRC/23/47/Add.1). The country 
</p>
<p>visit report provided an overview of the findings and 31 concrete recommendations. 
</p>
<p>2. The present follow-up report contains an analysis of the progress made by India in 
</p>
<p>implementing the recommendations made in the country visit report, based on desk 
</p>
<p>research. 
</p>
<p>3. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur documented deaths resulting from the 
</p>
<p>excessive use of force, deaths in custody, the imposition of the death penalty, attacks by 
</p>
<p>armed groups, killings related to communal violence and practices affecting women&#8217;s right 
</p>
<p>to life. He further addressed the fight against impunity, killings of vulnerable persons and 
</p>
<p>the role of human rights commissions, highlighting that the obstacles to accountability 
</p>
<p>should be removed. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur made a number of recommendations regarding the need to 
</p>
<p>reform laws and policies to ensure the accountability of State actors for violations of the 
</p>
<p>right to life; the establishment of a commission of inquiry into extrajudicial executions in 
</p>
<p>India, which should also serve a transitional justice role; the need to increase the protection 
</p>
<p>of civilians, especially vulnerable groups, through legal reform as well as information and 
</p>
<p>awareness-raising campaigns and increased sensitization and orientation programmes; and 
</p>
<p>the need to strengthen State institutions, including the judiciary and the National Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Commission. 
</p>
<p>5. Since the visit, measures that have been undertaken to implement the 
</p>
<p>recommendations made. There has been reform at the legislative level, with some bills 
</p>
<p>pending before parliament. The Supreme Court of India appointed a commission on 4 
</p>
<p>January 2013 to inquire into six alleged cases of extrajudicial executions and to record its 
</p>
<p>findings regarding the antecedents of the victims and the circumstances in which they were 
</p>
<p>killed. The commission was also directed to report on the functioning of the State Police 
</p>
<p>and the Security Forces in the state of Manipur and to make recommendations for keeping 
</p>
<p>the police and security forces within the legal bounds without compromising the fight 
</p>
<p>against insurgencies. The Commission also addressed the larger question on the role of the 
</p>
<p>police and the security forces in Manipur. On 23 December 2012. the Government also 
</p>
<p>constituted a committee to look into possible amendments to the Criminal Law to provide 
</p>
<p>for quicker trials and enhanced punishments for criminals committing sexual assault of an 
</p>
<p>extreme nature against women. The reports of both bodies contain useful recommendations 
</p>
<p>to further strengthen State institutions and the protection of the right to life.1 
</p>
<p>6. However, much remains to be done to address and prevent extrajudicial killings and 
</p>
<p>to ensure accountability. Often, guidelines provided by the courts or the National Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Commission and recommendations by commissions of inquiry remain on paper with 
</p>
<p>little or no implementation on the ground. Impunity continues to prevail with various 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>4 </b> 
</p>
<p>legislative provisions and practices that hinder full and proper accountability. The result is 
</p>
<p>that vulnerable persons, including women, marginalized communities, human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders, victims and witnesses, continue to remain at risk of violence, often resulting in 
</p>
<p>death. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>7. In paragraph 8 of its resolution 26/12, the Human Rights Council urged States, inter 
</p>
<p>alia, to cooperate with and assist the Special Rapporteur in the performance of his tasks, to 
</p>
<p>supply all necessary information requested by him and to ensure appropriate follow-up to 
</p>
<p>his recommendations and conclusions. In this context, when writing his follow-up reports, 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur requests States to provide him with information on the actions taken 
</p>
<p>on those recommendations. Such information, when provided, helps to ensure a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive report that gives full recognition to all steps taken. 
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur recognizes the importance of follow-up reports as a critical 
</p>
<p>component of country visits to investigate allegations of violations of the right to life, and 
</p>
<p>as a principal working method. Country visits are an essential means to obtain direct and 
</p>
<p>first-hand information on human rights violations.  
</p>
<p>9. The present follow-up report was prepared on the basis of all available information 
</p>
<p>and was completed on 30 April 2015. The Special Rapporteur requested information from 
</p>
<p>the Government and from other actors on the steps that had been taken to implement the 
</p>
<p>recommendations made. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of India for its 
</p>
<p>response dated 21 April 2015 and for the information provided. Consultations were also 
</p>
<p>undertaken with domestic and international civil society groups. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>expresses his gratitude to all stakeholders who contributed to the present report. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Violations of the right to life by State actors 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Deaths resulting from excessive use of force 
</b></p>
<p>10. During his country visit, the Special Rapporteur received a series of complaints 
</p>
<p>regarding deaths resulting from the excessive use of force by security officers. The force 
</p>
<p>used, according to the reports, had little adherence to the principles of proportionality and 
</p>
<p>necessity, as defined under international human rights law standards. In the country visit 
</p>
<p>report, the Special Rapporteur referred to India&#8217;s National Crime Records Bureau statistics, 
</p>
<p>which indicate that, in 2011, there were 109 civilian deaths owing to police firing (See 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/23/47/Add.1, para. 9). The 2013 Bureau statistics indicate that the number of 
</p>
<p>civilian deaths owing to police firing had decreased only marginally, to 103 civilians.2 
</p>
<p>11. In his country visit report, the Special Rapporteur recommended that section 46 of 
</p>
<p>the Code of Criminal Procedure and legislation in all states regarding use of force, 
</p>
<p>including the exceptional use of lethal force, by all security officers should be reviewed to 
</p>
<p>ensure compliance with international human rights law principles (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/23/47/Add.1, para. 102). He was especially concerned with section 46 of the Code, 
</p>
<p>as it authorizes law enforcement officials to use &#8220;all means necessary&#8221; when an arrest is 
</p>
<p>forcibly resisted, without further qualifications, allowing force that goes beyond those 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 See National Crime Records Bureau, Ministry of Home Affairs, &#8220;Crime in India 2013 &#8211; Statistics&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>p. 564. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>powers permitted under international human rights law. The Special Rapporteur regrets that 
</p>
<p>the section has so far not been reviewed or amended. 
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur also noted in his country visit report that the 
</p>
<p>disproportionate use of force by law enforcement officials was often the cause of death 
</p>
<p>during demonstrations, and specific reference was made to the excessive use of force 
</p>
<p>against demonstrators in the Jammu and Kashmir regions in 2010. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>takes note of the information provided in the response by the State that there were 2,241 
</p>
<p>demonstrations in 2010 in Jammu and Kashmir and that, regrettably, not all of them were 
</p>
<p>peaceful. High numbers of civilians, police personnel and security forces were injured in 
</p>
<p>those demonstrations. The State has indicated that, in all instances of death, a First 
</p>
<p>Information Report was lodged and an investigation initiated. This would be an 
</p>
<p>encouraging development. However, the Special Rapporteur emphasizes the need for such 
</p>
<p>investigations to be completed soon, and urges the State to make public all findings from 
</p>
<p>such investigations and ensure that the policing of demonstrations, including non-peaceful 
</p>
<p>demonstrations, is always in compliance with the international human rights standards on 
</p>
<p>the use of force. 
</p>
<p>13. The country visit report documented the practice of &#8220;fake encounters&#8221; and the 
</p>
<p>accusations that it had been carried out by the police, the central armed forces, armed forces 
</p>
<p>and the border security forces. The Special Rapporteur notes of the recent conviction of and 
</p>
<p>recommended life sentences for five security officers for the fake encounter that occurred 
</p>
<p>on 30 April 2010, in which three youths were killed by the armed forces. This is a welcome 
</p>
<p>instance of accountability. 
</p>
<p>14. The country visit report also documented the registration of First Information 
</p>
<p>Reports by security officers after alleged fake encounters, in which they gave their accounts 
</p>
<p>of the events. This often led to the swift closure of cases, as the content of the reports was 
</p>
<p>frequently undisputed. The Special Rapporteur recommended that the registration of a First 
</p>
<p>Information Report should be prompt and mandatory in all cases of suspected unlawful 
</p>
<p>killings and death threats. It was also recommended that an independent mechanism be put 
</p>
<p>in place to monitor the registration of First Information Reports, as well as the punishment 
</p>
<p>of those law enforcement officials who refuse to register them (see A/HRC/23/47/Add.1, 
</p>
<p>para. 110). The Criminal Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of India recently 
</p>
<p>confirmed that, when investigating police encounters in cases of death, as a standard 
</p>
<p>procedure for thorough, effective and independent investigation, a First Information Report 
</p>
<p>should be registered and forwarded to the Court under section 157 of the Code of Criminal 
</p>
<p>Procedure without delay. 3 The Supreme Court issued a number of requirements, many 
</p>
<p>based on the National Human Rights Commission guidelines on encounter deaths and 
</p>
<p>statutory provisions, to be followed when investigating police encounters that result in 
</p>
<p>death of a civilian. No independent mechanism to monitor the registration of First 
</p>
<p>Information Reports exists. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act and related legislation 
</b></p>
<p>15. In his country visit report, the Special Rapporteur noted that the situation concerning 
</p>
<p>the use of force in India was exacerbated by the implementation of the Armed Forces 
</p>
<p>(Special Powers) Act. The Act is applied in areas that have been declared &#8220;disturbed&#8221; or 
</p>
<p>&#8220;dangerous&#8221; to the extent that the use of armed force is deemed necessary. These have 
</p>
<p>included areas of Manipur, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland 
</p>
<p>  
 3 <i>People</i>&#8217;<i>s Union for Civil Liberties &amp; Anr. </i>v.<i> State of Maharashtra &amp; Ors</i>, Criminal Appeal No. 1255 
</p>
<p>of 1999, decided on 23 September 2014, para. 31 (2). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>6 </b> 
</p>
<p>and Tripur, while in Jammu and Kashmir, a nearly identical piece of legislation known as 
</p>
<p>the Jammu and Kashmir Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act is applied. 
</p>
<p>16. Particular concern was expressed in the report over the provisions in the Act 
</p>
<p>regulating the use of lethal force, in violation of the international standards on the use of 
</p>
<p>force, and the related principles of proportionality and necessity. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>also expressed his concern at the protection granted to officers under the Armed Forces 
</p>
<p>(Special Powers) Act and the Jammu and Kashmir Act, where the prosecution of such 
</p>
<p>officers is prohibited unless sanction to prosecute is granted by the central Government. 
</p>
<p>This rarely occurs in practice. Thus, accountability for extrajudicial or arbitrary killings 
</p>
<p>committed by armed forces members is frequently made practically impossible.4 The Indian 
</p>
<p>Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Act and provided several conditions on 
</p>
<p>the use of the special powers conferred on the Armed Forces by section 4 thereof.5 This part 
</p>
<p>of the country visit report in particular was strenuously opposed by the Government in its 
</p>
<p>comments thereto, on the basis that the State viewed it as a gross disregard for the Supreme 
</p>
<p>Court (see A/HRC/23/47/Add.<footnote name="7">Available from https://humanrightsmanipur.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/ejevfam.pdf.  </footnote>, para. 1). This approach seems not to take into account the 
</p>
<p>fact that the special procedures of the Human Rights Council regularly pronounce on the 
</p>
<p>rulings of domestic courts from all over the world, in line with the established principle of 
</p>
<p>international law that States are internationally responsible for the actions of all their organs 
</p>
<p>(see General Assembly resolution 65/19). 
</p>
<p>17. Several international bodies and Indian authorities have subsequently also expressed 
</p>
<p>concern over the provisions of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act. The Justice Verma 
</p>
<p>Committee, constituted in December 2012 as a result and within a few days of the brutal 
</p>
<p>gang rape and murder committed in New Delhi on 16 December 2012, recommended the 
</p>
<p>continuance of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act and similar legal protocols in 
</p>
<p>internal conflict areas be immediately reviewed. The Committee found that the review was 
</p>
<p>necessary in order to determine the propriety of resorting to such legislation in the areas 
</p>
<p>concerned. 6 In July 2014, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
</p>
<p>Women called upon India to implement the recommendations of the Justice Verma 
</p>
<p>Committee and to promptly review the continued application of Act and related legal 
</p>
<p>protocols (see CEDAW/C/IND/CO/4-5, para. 13 (a)). The Committee also urged India to 
</p>
<p>amend and/or repeal the Act, so that sexual violence against women perpetrated by 
</p>
<p>members of the armed forces could be brought under the purview of ordinary criminal law 
</p>
<p>and, pending such amendment or repeal, to remove the requirement for government 
</p>
<p>permission to prosecute members of the armed forces accused of crimes of violence against 
</p>
<p>women or other human rights abuses of women, and to grant permission to enable 
</p>
<p>prosecution in all pending cases. 
</p>
<p>18. In part V, paragraph 5.4 of its report,7 a commission appointed by the Supreme 
</p>
<p>Court stated that it was time to progressively de-notify areas of the State under the Act, and 
</p>
<p>to withdraw section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. That commission agreed with 
</p>
<p>the Jeevan Reddy Committee created to review the Act. The Committee&#700;s report has not 
</p>
<p>been made public, but determined that the Act had become a symbol of oppression, an 
</p>
<p>object of hate and an instrument of discrimination and high-handedness, and that it was 
</p>
<p>highly desirable and advisable to repeal it altogether. In part IV, paragraph 3.10 of its 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 4 See <i>Army Headquarters v. CBI</i>, 2012 6 SCC 228. 
</p>
<p> 5 See Naga People&#8217;s Movement of Human Rights v. <i>Union of India And Others</i>, Supreme Court of 
</p>
<p>India, 27 November 1997, para. 79 (8). 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>report, the commission found that the conditions laid down by the Supreme Court had 
</p>
<p>remained largely on paper only and were mostly followed in violation. 
</p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur, however, regrets that India has not followed the 
</p>
<p>recommendation that it repeal or at least radically amend the Act, as well as the equivalent 
</p>
<p>legislation in Jammu and Kashmir, to ensure that legislation regarding the use of force is 
</p>
<p>brought in line with international human rights law and to remove all legal barriers for the 
</p>
<p>criminal prosecution of members of the armed forces. The Special Rapporteur also 
</p>
<p>recommended that, while waiting for the necessary repeal or amendment of the Act, it must 
</p>
<p>be ensured that the status of a &#8220;disturbed area&#8221; is subject to regular review and a justified 
</p>
<p>decision is made on its further extension.8 In that regard, he has been informed that states of 
</p>
<p>the North-East and Jammu and Kashmir regions continue to be declared &#8220;disturbed areas&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>without any deliberation, justification or reference to the scale of insurgency in the 
</p>
<p>respective areas.9 
</p>
<p><b> C. Deaths in custody  
</b></p>
<p>20. In his country visit report, the Special Rapporteur noted that, throughout his visit to 
</p>
<p>the State, several cases of custodial deaths were reported to him. These reports spoke of 
</p>
<p>individuals who had allegedly been unlawfully taken into custody, severely beaten and later 
</p>
<p>died in hospital. Serious concern was expressed at the fact that no steps had been taken to 
</p>
<p>bring the perpetrators to account for the deaths. The National Crime Records Bureau data 
</p>
<p>for 2011 indicated that over 100 deaths had occurred in police custody in India and that 
</p>
<p>none of the 14 police officers against whom formal accusations had been brought were 
</p>
<p>convicted (see A/HRC/23/47/Add.1, para. 29). The 2013 Bureau data indicates that over 
</p>
<p>100 police custodial deaths were reported and that there was one conviction.10 
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur welcomed the National Human Rights Commission 
</p>
<p>guidelines on custodial deaths and rapes, which include guidelines on the period within 
</p>
<p>which a death is to be reported, the procedure to be followed and methods to conduct 
</p>
<p>autopsies. The Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act of 2005 mandates that a 
</p>
<p>judicial inquiry must take place in all instances where any person dies or disappears while 
</p>
<p>in custody of the police or in any other custody. The Special Rapporteur, however, also 
</p>
<p>expressed concern that these provisions are not complied with in practice. This was 
</p>
<p>confirmed the aforementioned commission appointed by the Supreme Court, which, in 
</p>
<p>part IV, paragraphs 4.6 and 4.9 of its report, found that, in the cases before it, magisterial 
</p>
<p>enquiries and judicial enquiries had only been ordered after a lapse of a couple of years; 
</p>
<p>and that the National Human Rights Commission guidelines on search, seizure and inquests 
</p>
<p>were not being followed in instances of police action resulting in death. 
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur made a recommendation that autopsies be carried out in 
</p>
<p>conformity with international standards and that the families of victims be given full and 
</p>

<p>and recommended that post-mortems be conducted as quickly as possible after incidents, 
</p>
<p>that post-mortems in encounter cases should be video recorded, and that a hand wash of the 
</p>
<p>deceased must be taken and sent for forensic analysis, which is necessary because of the 
</p>
<p>frequent contention by security forces that the deceased fired at them. 
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur also recommended that India ratify the Convention against 
</p>
<p>Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and its Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol, and that it swiftly enact the Prevention of Torture Bill and ensure its compliance 
</p>
<p>with the Convention. The Bill was introduced in 2010 but, despite provisional steps taken 
</p>
<p>to enact it, no further steps seem to have been taken in this regard. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Imposition of the death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>24. In his country visit report, the Special Rapporteur noted his concern regarding the 
</p>
<p>execution that took place in 2012, the first since 2004, when a de facto moratorium on 
</p>
<p>executions was introduced. Further concern was noted in relation to legislative provisions 
</p>
<p>that provided for the imposition of the death penalty for offences that did not comply with 
</p>
<p>the &#8220;most serious crime&#8221; provision under international law, and the extension of offences 
</p>
<p>for which the death penalty may be imposed. In 2013, India performed another execution 
</p>
<p>and, in 2014, again voted against the General Assembly draft resolution calling for a 
</p>
<p>moratorium on the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur recommended that India consider placing a moratorium on 
</p>
<p>the death penalty with a view to abolishing it and that legislation be reviewed to provide 
</p>
<p>that the death penalty may only be imposed for the most serious crimes, such as intentional 
</p>
<p>killing. The State is again called upon to consider implementing these recommendations as 
</p>
<p>a priority. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that the Law Commission of India is 
</p>
<p>undertaking a research project on the death penalty. As part of that process, in May 2014, 
</p>
<p>the Commission published a consultation paper 11  on capital punishment, including a 
</p>
<p>detailed questionnaire and an invitation to submit written suggestions, comments and input 
</p>
<p>into the study. The Commission intends to collect data relating to the death penalty from 
</p>
<p>various courts and prison authorities, and may include the research assistance of law 
</p>
<p>schools. 
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the recent decision of the Supreme Court in the 
</p>
<p>matter of <i>Shatrughan Chauhan </i>v.<i> Union of India</i>,12 by which the Court held that the death 
</p>
<p>sentence of a condemned prisoner could be commuted to life imprisonment on the basis of 
</p>
<p>a delay on the part of the Government in deciding a mercy plea. The Court held that the 
</p>
<p>prolonged delay in implementing the death sentence had a dehumanizing effect, which in 
</p>
<p>turn had the constitutional implication of depriving a person of his/her life in an unjust, 
</p>
<p>unfair and unreasonable way so as to offend the fundamental right to life under article 21 of 
</p>
<p>the Constitution. In so doing, the Court commuted the death penalty to life imprisonment 
</p>
<p>for 15 death row inmates. The Court further held that mental illness was one of the 
</p>
<p>supervening circumstances that warranted commutation of a death sentence to life 
</p>
<p>imprisonment.

<p><b> IV. Violations of the right to life by non-State actors  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Deaths resulting from attacks by armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur has expressed concern that non-State actors resorting to the 
</p>
<p>use of deadly violence have threatened the lives and security of civilians and the security of 
</p>
<p>India and strongly condemns the callous nature of these acts. The State has a duty to protect 
</p>
<p>its people from such acts of violence, but should do so in accordance with international 
</p>
<p>human rights standards. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Killings related to communal violence  
</b></p>
<p>28. In his country visit report, the Special Rapporteur noted that tension between various 
</p>
<p>communities in India frequently resulted in incidents of communal violence. Numerous 
</p>
<p>reports concerning major incidents of communal violence indicated an often wilful failure 
</p>
<p>by State forces to protect citizens. The Special Rapporteur documented reports of apparent 
</p>
<p>tolerance by State forces of attacks against religious minorities. More alarming were reports 
</p>
<p>that State agents were actively involved in attacks on the lives and rights of such minorities. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur highlighted statistics from 2011 that indicated that 91 people had 
</p>
<p>died that year in incidents of communal violence (See A/HRC/23/47/Add.1, paras. 43 and 
</p>
<p>44). Statistics for 2013 indicate that the figure has only decreased slightly to 71 deaths.13 
</p>
<p>29. During the country visit, special attention was drawn to the high level of communal 
</p>
<p>violence in Gujarat. In his report, the Special Rapporteur expressed concern at the lengthy 
</p>
<p>and less than effective conduct of the inquiries carried out at that time into the events. He 
</p>
<p>recommended that the Nanavati-Metha Commission, established in 2002 and appointed to 
</p>
<p>investigate the events that took place in Gujarat that year, should ensure that their findings 
</p>
<p>are published in a swift and transparent manner. At the time of drafting the present report, 
</p>
<p>the Nanavati-Metha Commission had concluded its investigation, 12 years and more than 
</p>
<p>20 extensions later, and submitted its final report to the Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2014. 
</p>
<p>The report has not been made public and the content of the report is unknown. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur calls on the Government to make the Commission&#8217;s full report public. 
</p>
<p>30. In the context of investigating and addressing communal violence, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur mentioned in his country visit report the Prevention of Communal and Targeted 
</p>
<p>Violence (Access to Justice and Reparations) Bill of 2011, which aimed at preventing 
</p>
<p>communal violence and ensuring accountability for the failure to prevent such violence and 
</p>
<p>protect life and property. The Bill also introduced the principle of command and/or superior 
</p>
<p>responsibility, and stipulated the rights of victims to reparations and remedies. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur notes that the Bill has not been passed. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the 
</p>
<p>statement made by the Prime Minister on 17 February 2015 expressing strong 
</p>
<p>condemnation of religious violence and undertaking to act strongly in this regard.

</p>
<p><b> C. </b>Practice affecting women&#8217;s right to life <b> 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the report of the Justice Verma Committee14 and 
</p>
<p>notes that the implementation of its recommendations has the potential to bring much-
</p>
<p>needed and effective change in preventing violence against women, by holding the State 
</p>
<p>accountable, ensuring the necessary commitment and change required in both law and 
</p>
<p>policy, as well as in the implementation thereof. In its comprehensive report, the 
</p>
<p>Committee addresses all forms of violence against women; calls for police, electoral and 
</p>
<p>education and perception reform; proposes a number of criminal law amendments, an 
</p>
<p>emergency response system and the creation of a bill of rights for women; and suggests 
</p>
<p>guidelines for medical examinations. While some steps have already been taken by the 
</p>
<p>Government to implement the recommendations made by the Committee, these have not 
</p>
<p>been without criticism, and much more is needed &#8211; a fact that has been recognized by the 
</p>
<p>State. 
</p>
<p>32. In his country visit report, the Special Rapporteur called upon the State to review its 
</p>
<p>criminal legislation to ensure that all gender-based killings receive high sentences, possibly 
</p>
<p>in the form of life imprisonment. The recommendations of the Justice Verma Committee, as 
</p>
<p>well as some amendments that have already been made to India&#8217;s Criminal Law, show that 
</p>
<p>positive steps are being taken. 
</p>
<p>33. However, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that the Criminal Law (Amendment) 
</p>
<p>Bill passed by parliament through an amendment to the Penal Code allows for the death 
</p>
<p>penalty to be imposed for repeat offenders of rape and in cases of brutal rape that render the 
</p>
<p>survivor in a vegetative state. This is not in compliance with the &#8220;most serious crime&#8221; 
</p>
<p>requirement under international law and goes against the recommendation of the Justice 
</p>
<p>Verma Committee that life imprisonment be imposed where rape results in the death or the 
</p>
<p>persistent vegetative state of the victim. While the attempt by the State to seriously address 
</p>
<p>acts of violence perpetrated against women is commended, the Special Rapporteur does not 
</p>
<p>encourage the imposition of the death penalty in such cases. 
</p>
<p><b>  Dowry deaths, </b>&#8220;<b>honour</b>&#8221;<b> and witch killings 
</b></p>
<p>34. In his country visit report, the Special Rapporteur recommended that the State 
</p>
<p>require that the police, judiciary and general public undertake increased sensitization and 
</p>
<p>orientation programmes in respect of all forms of killings of women, especially in the areas 
</p>
<p>most affected (see A/HRC/23/47/Add.1, para. 119). 
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
</p>
<p>against Women have expressed concern at the extent of dowry deaths in India. The 2013 
</p>
<p>National Crime Records Bureau statistics reflect a very small reduction in the number of 
</p>
<p>dowry deaths,15 although the figures reported by the Bureau in 2011 and 2013 may not fully 
</p>
<p>reflect the scope of the problem, owing to underreporting. The Special Rapporteur supports 
</p>
<p>the call made by the Committee in 2014 for the State to implement systemic and sustained 
</p>
<p>action that would lead to the elimination of stereotypes associated with dowry deaths as 
</p>
<p>well as the practice itself (see CEDAW/C/IND/CO/4-5, para. 20). The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>also supports the recommendation of the Justice Verma Committee that all marriages in 
</p>
<p>India, irrespective of the personal laws under which such marriages are solemnized, be 
</p>
<p>mandatorily registered in the presence of a magistrate, who should ensure that the marriage

<p>has been solemnized without any demand for dowry and with the full and free consent of 
</p>
<p>both partners. 
</p>
<p>36. &#8220;Honour&#8221; killings, as documented in the country visit report, remain a problem in 
</p>
<p>India. The Justice Verma Committee addressed the practice of such killings and concluded 
</p>
<p>that the State must ensure that village councils, also known as &#8220;Khap Panchayats&#8221;, and 
</p>
<p>similar institutions do not interfere with the choices made by men and women in respect of 
</p>
<p>marriage. 
</p>
<p>37. The phenomenon of witch killings in parts of India was observed and documented 
</p>
<p>by the Special Rapporteur in his country visit report (see A/HRC/23/47/Add.1, para. 61). 
</p>
<p>The practice, which is almost exclusively directed against women, was reported to be most 
</p>
<p>prevalent in poorer and marginalized communities. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the 
</p>
<p>response of the State that killings motivated by accusations of witchcraft are acknowledged 
</p>
<p>and tackled at the local level by State authorities (see A/HRC/23/47/Add.7, para. 2). 
</p>
<p>38. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women expressed its 
</p>
<p>concern in 2014 over persistent traditional practices that contribute to the dangerous 
</p>
<p>gender-based stereotypes surrounding witchcraft. The Committee expressed disappointment 
</p>
<p>at the State&#8217;s insufficient actions to systemically and consistently modify and eliminate the 
</p>
<p>harmful stereotypes that contribute to killings motivated by allegations of witchcraft (see 
</p>
<p>CEDAW/C/IND/CO/4-5, para. 20). In the country visit report, it was noted that legislation 
</p>
<p>against witch-hunting existed in some parts of India. However, concern exists over the 
</p>
<p>adequacy of the punishment and of exposing women accused of witchcraft to stigma, public 
</p>
<p>humiliation, violence and, in most severe cases, death. Further challenges include witnesses 
</p>
<p>who are often unwilling to testify against offenders owing to societal pressure and fear of 
</p>
<p>being associated with a witch, and instances where the witness considers death as an 
</p>
<p>appropriate punishment. Furthermore, it was reported to the Special Rapporteur that women 
</p>
<p>from rural areas and with no financial means faced severe challenges in gaining access to 
</p>
<p>justice, including owing to the reluctance of the police to register and investigate their 
</p>
<p>cases.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Other challenges  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Fight against impunity 
</b></p>
<p>39. In his country visit report, the Special Rapporteur documented various factors that 
</p>
<p>contribute to the challenge of impunity in India. In order to address some of those 
</p>
<p>challenges, he recommended that legal barriers for the prosecution of public servants be 
</p>
<p>removed, including the requirement for prior sanction from the Government, and that 
</p>
<p>section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code be reviewed (see A/HRC/23/47/Add.1, 
</p>
<p>para. 103). Pursuant to the recommendation of the Justice Verma Committee, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur welcomes that an explanation has been added to section 197 (1) of the Criminal 
</p>
<p>Procedure Code, to clarify that no prior sanction is necessary for the prosecution of public 
</p>
<p>servants who are accused of sexual offences.16 However, for all other crimes, the prior 
</p>
<p>sanction provision continues to be a major hurdle for victims in securing remedies for 
</p>
<p>human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur recommended that the State ensure that command and/or 
</p>
<p>superior responsibility be applied for violations by security officials of the right to life, and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 16 See www.prsindia.org/uploads/media/Criminal%20Law,%202013/Criminal%20Law

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>12 </b> 
</p>
<p>that the establishment and effective functioning of the Independent Police Complaints 
</p>
<p>Authorities should be made a priority in all states (see A/HRC/23/47/Add.1, paras. 109 and 
</p>
<p>113). The Special Rapporteur regrets that, according to the information received, that 
</p>
<p>responsibility remains absent. 
</p>
<p>41. In his country visit report, the Special Rapporteur recommended that promotions and 
</p>
<p>other types of awards for security officers suspected to have been involved in unlawful 
</p>
<p>killings should not be granted until the facts are fully clarified (ibid., para. 112) . The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur notes the order of the Supreme Court in relation to encounter killings, in 
</p>
<p>the matter of People&#8217;s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) &amp; Anr. v<i>. State of Maharashtra &amp; 
</i></p>
<p><i>Ors.</i>,17 that &#8220;no out-of-turn promotion or instant gallantry rewards shall be bestowed on the 
</p>
<p>concerned officers soon after the occurrence. It must be ensured at all costs that such 
</p>
<p>rewards are given/recommended only when the gallantry of the concerned officers is 
</p>
<p>established beyond doubt&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the order of the Supreme Court and calls upon the 
</p>
<p>Government to ensure its full and proper implementation. He notes with concern reports 
</p>
<p>that police officers who have been suspended upon their arrest in cases of suspected 
</p>
<p>extrajudicial killings and charged with extrajudicial killings have been reinstated in senior 
</p>
<p>positions in the police force by the State. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that this will 
</p>
<p>encourage impunity and may impede the criminal trials against the reinstated officers.18 
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur also recommended that the Government put in place a 
</p>
<p>mechanism to regularly review and monitor the status of implementation of the directives 
</p>
<p>of the Supreme Court and the National Human Rights Commission guidelines on arrest, 
</p>
<p>encounter killings, and custodial violence and death (see A/HRC/23/47/Add.1, para. 108). 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur has been informed that, so far, no mechanism has been put in place 
</p>
<p>to undertake the review and monitoring as recommended. 
</p>
<p>44. The country visit report included some of the challenges in the accountability 
</p>
<p>process, for which it was recommended that the State consider launching a process of 
</p>
<p>reflection on the need to reform its judiciary with the aim of reducing the length of judicial 
</p>
<p>proceedings and strengthening the independent functioning of the judiciary (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/23/47/Add.1, paras. 67 and 125). The Special Rapporteur is not aware of any such 
</p>
<p>process, as recommended, being undertaken. 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur recommended that the State ensure, in addition to the 
</p>
<p>payment of compensation to the victims or their families, that criminal investigations, 
</p>
<p>prosecutions and trials be launched and conducted in a swift, effective and impartial 
</p>
<p>manner in all cases of unlawful killings, irrespective of the status of the perpetrator. The 
</p>
<p>recommendation was made on the basis of concern expressed after the country visit, 
</p>
<p>regarding cases involving unlawful killings, that the practice of paying compensation to 
</p>
<p>victims or their families has often replaced prosecution (ibid., paras. 73 and 111). The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur notes the order of the Supreme Court in People&#8217;s Union for Civil 
</p>
<p><i>Liberties (PUCL) &amp; Anr. v. State of Maharashtra &amp; Ors</i>, that compensation be paid under 
</p>
<p>section 357-A of the Criminal Procedure Code. While compensation is crucial in redressing 
</p>
<p>violations, it should never replace the investigation and prosecution of alleged perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>The investigations and prosecutions must be launched in a swift, effective and impartial 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p> 18 Reports indicate that police officials charged for the suspected unlawful killing of Ishrat Jahan, Javed 
</p>
<p>Sheikh, Amjadali Rana and Jishan Johar, as well as police officials charged for the suspected 
</p>
<p>unlawful killing of Sohrabuddin Sheikh, Kausarbi and Tulsiram Prajapati, were reinstated in the

<p>manner. Examples of protracted investigations and prosecutions have been brought to the 
</p>
<p>attention of the Special Rapporteur, including: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The ongoing trial of 19 members of the Provincial Armed Constabulary for the 
</p>
<p>alleged unlawful killings of 42 Muslim men in 198719  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The delay in the commencement of the trial of officers implicated in the 2004 
</p>
<p>unlawful killing of four civilians, including a young woman, despite the filing of a 
</p>
<p>charge sheet by the Central Bureau of Investigation20 
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur recommended that the National Human Rights Commission 
</p>
<p>issue guidelines on the conduct of inquests and autopsies in all cases of suspected unlawful 
</p>
<p>killings (see A/HRC/23/47/Add.1, para. 122). At the time of writing the present report, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur was not aware of any steps taken in this regard. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Killings of vulnerable persons 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Scheduled castes and tribes and other marginalized communities 
</b></p>
<p>47. In his country visit report, the Special Rapporteur noted that, according to the 
</p>
<p>National Crime Records Bureau, 35 murders had been committed in 2011 for caste-related 
</p>
<p>reasons (ibid., para. 77). In 2013, according to the Bureau, the figure had decreased to 32 
</p>
<p>murders.21 The figures quoted by the Bureau differ substantially from those provided by 
</p>
<p>non-governmental organizations. The Special Rapporteur recommended that existing 
</p>
<p>criminal legislation be reviewed to ensure that perpetrators of killings against members of 
</p>
<p>lowers castes or tribes receive higher sentences, perhaps life imprisonment (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/23/47/Add.1, para. 105). 
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur also noted with concern that the Scheduled Castes and 
</p>
<p>Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act of 1989 did not incorporate Dalit Muslims 
</p>
<p>and Christians into the definition of scheduled castes and tribes. A recommendation was 
</p>
<p>made that the legislation should be reviewed to extend the definition (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/23/47/Add.1, para. 104). The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
</p>
<p>against Women noted in 2014 that Dalit women were particularly vulnerable as they faced 
</p>
<p>multiple forms of discrimination presenting barriers to justice and that poor implementation 
</p>
<p>of the Act was of concern (see CEDAW/C/IND/CO/4-5, para. 10 (d)). The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur is aware of the recent passing of the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Orders 
</p>
<p>(Amendment) Bill, 2014, and welcomes the inclusion of additional communities to the list 
</p>
<p>of scheduled castes, but reiterates the importance of ensuring the protection of all 
</p>
<p>marginalized communities in practice through effective implementation of the related 
</p>
<p>legislation, as well as the conduct of relevant education and awareness-raising campaigns 
</p>
<p>reaching out to all communities. 
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the introduction of the Scheduled Castes and the 
</p>
<p>Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Bill of 2014, which includes new 
</p>
<p>categories of offences; specifies the duties of a public servant, including to register a 
</p>
<p>complaint or First Information Report; provides that the Exclusive Special Courts must be 
</p>
<p>established at the district level to try offences; and adds a chapter on the rights of victims

</p>
<p>and witnesses, including taking immediate action in respect of any complaint relating to the 
</p>
<p>harassment of a victim, informant or witness. Effective implementation of this legislation 
</p>
<p>remains essential.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>50. In his country visit report, the Special Rapporteur expressed concern over the 
</p>
<p>increased targeting of human rights defenders, by both State and non-State actors. 
</p>
<p>Journalists and human rights defenders often fall victim to the violence between armed 
</p>
<p>groups and the Government. The State indicated during the universal periodic review in 
</p>
<p>2012 that existing legislation was in place to protect human rights defenders. It further 
</p>
<p>noted that human rights defenders had direct access to the Indian Supreme Court for 
</p>
<p>matters concerning human rights violations and that there were several existing measures 
</p>
<p>established by the National Human Rights Commission that aimed to protect human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders (see A/HRC/21/10, para. 81). 
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the recently adopted Whistle Blowers Protection 
</p>
<p>Act, 2014, as a positive measure taken by the State in the protection of human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders. The Act sets up a mechanism to receive complaints of corruption or wilful 
</p>
<p>misuse of power by a public servant and provides safeguard measures against the 
</p>
<p>victimization of a complainant. The Act, however, does not provide any penalty for 
</p>
<p>victimizing a complainant and the exposure to further harassment. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Protection of victims and witnesses 
</b></p>
<p>52. In his country visit report, the Special Rapporteur recommended that the State 
</p>
<p>establish an effective witness and victim protection programme (see A/HRC/23/47/Add.1, 
</p>
<p>para. 116). No programme has yet been created by the State. 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur notes the recommendation by the Justice Verma Committee 
</p>
<p>that the State immediately implement measures of special care to ensure the safety of 
</p>
<p>female complainants and witnesses in cases of sexual assault by armed personnel. The 
</p>
<p>inclusion of a chapter on the rights of victims and witnesses in the Scheduled Castes and 
</p>
<p>the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Bill of 2014 is a welcome step. 
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur has been informed of instances where the Supreme Court 
</p>
<p>has filed petitions, with the assistance of human rights lawyers, requesting the protection of 
</p>
<p>witnesses or victims of violence. For example, the Supreme Court directed that seven 
</p>
<p>women survivors of gang rape during communal violence in Uttar Pradesh in 2013 be 
</p>
<p>provided with two security personnel each until the completion of the trial, or until each of 
</p>
<p>the women so desires.22 While this is a positive step, access to legal recourse may be more 
</p>
<p>difficult for some individuals, especially those from poorer and marginalized sections of 
</p>
<p>society. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur has been informed that the security cover 
</p>
<p>provided often falls short of constituting a comprehensive witness protection programme. 
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur has also been informed that the State has been working with 
</p>
<p>the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, in partnership the Counter-Terrorism 
</p>
<p>Committee Executive Directorate, on strengthening the protection and assistance of 
</p>
<p>witnesses and victims of terrorism. The State has a central scheme for assistance to the 
</p>
<p>families of the victims of terrorism.

<p><b> VI. The role of Human Rights Commissions 
</b></p>
<p>56. In his country visit report, the Special Rapporteur noted the important work that had 
</p>
<p>been undertaken by the National Human Rights Commission in the protection of the right 
</p>
<p>to life in India. He also documented some of the impediments faced by the Commission in 
</p>
<p>doing so (see A/HRC/23/47/Add.1, paras. 88&#8211;90). 
</p>
<p>57. In order to strengthen the National Human Rights Commission, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur recommended that the State amend section 19 of the Protection of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Act to provide the Commission with express authorization to investigate members of 
</p>
<p>the armed forces for alleged human rights violations. The Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women echoed this recommendation in 2014 (see 
</p>
<p>CEDAW/C/IND/CO/4-5, para. 13 (c)). No steps have been taken by the State to amend 
</p>
<p>section 19. 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur also recommended that a legal basis should be put in place 
</p>
<p>to enable the extension of the period of one year under which the National Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Commission can consider cases. The Special Rapporteur has been informed that no 
</p>
<p>measures have been taken to extend the one-year limitation. These provisions continue to 
</p>
<p>deprive victims from gaining access to the protection of the Commission. 
</p>
<p>59. In his country visit report, the Special Rapporteur recommended that the 
</p>
<p>independence and the functioning of State human rights commissions be reviewed to ensure 
</p>
<p>compliance with the Principles relating to the status of national institutions (Paris 
</p>
<p>Principles) (see A/HRC/23/47/Add.1, para. 123). The Special Rapporteur is not aware of 
</p>
<p>any such review under way in the State.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>India has taken certain positive steps to prevent the occurrence of extrajudicial 
</b></p>
<p><b>killings, including through the adoption of a number of guidelines and measures by 
</b></p>
<p><b>the courts and the National Human Rights Commission. Some positive legal reforms 
</b></p>
<p><b>have taken place, while others are currently before parliament. Various committees 
</b></p>
<p><b>and commissions have been appointed to address the occurrence of unlawful killings 
</b></p>
<p><b>and violence against particular groups, which has resulted in important 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations being made. 
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>Cases of extrajudicial killings continue to be reported by State actors and non-
</b></p>
<p><b>State actors alike. Impunity remains a serious problem and the lack of accountability 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the majority of instances of State actors is a principal concern. Legislation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>policy, such as the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act and similar, remain a real 
</b></p>
<p><b>impediment to proper accountability and should be promptly repealed or amended. 
</b></p>
<p><b>There is a need for fully independent bodies to be established to ensure that 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigations are properly conducted and perpetrators are held to account. 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>Vulnerable and marginalized groups must be protected from all forms of 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence, including lethal violence, and institutions tasked with monitoring, 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigating and prosecuting the perpetrators of such violence must be strengthened. 
</b></p>
<p><b>There is a need to put in place measures to address the barriers faced by vulnerable 
</b></p>
<p><b>and marginalized groups in gaining access to justice. </b></p>

<p><b>  Summary of follow-up to each recommendationa 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Violations of the right to life by State actors 
</b></p>
<p>1. <b>India should swiftly enact the Prevention of Torture Bill and ensure its 
</b></p>
<p><b>compliance with the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
</b></p>
<p><b>Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>
<p>2. <b>India should repeal, or at least radically amend, the Armed Forces (Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Powers) Act and the Jammu and Kashmir Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, with 
</b></p>
<p><b>the aim of ensuring that the legislation regarding the use of force by the armed forces 
</b></p>
<p><b>provides for the respect of the principles of proportionality and necessity in all 
</b></p>
<p><b>instances, as stipulated under international human rights law. It should also remove 
</b></p>
<p><b>all legal barriers for the criminal prosecution of members of the armed forces. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>
<p>3. <b>While waiting for the necessary amendment or repeal of the Armed Forces 
</b></p>
<p><b>(Special Powers) Act, it should be ensured that the status of a </b>&#8220;<b>disturbed area</b>&#8221;<b> under 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Act is subject to regular review </b>&#8211;<b> for example, every six months </b>&#8211;<b> and a justified 
</b></p>
<p><b>decision is made on its further extension. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>
<p>4. <b>Section 46 of the Criminal Procedure Code and legislation in all states 
</b></p>
<p><b>regarding use of force, including the exceptional use of lethal force, by all security 
</b></p>
<p><b>officers should be reviewed to ensure compliance with international human rights law 
</b></p>
<p><b>principles of proportionality and necessity. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>
<p>5. <b>Section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code should be reviewed in order to 
</b></p>
<p><b>remove any legal barriers for the criminal prosecution of a public servant, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>the need for prior sanction from the Government before cognizance can be taken of 
</b></p>
<p><b>any offence by a public servant for criminal prosecution. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has been partially implemented. 
</p>
<p>6. <b>The Indian legislation regarding the imposition of the death penalty should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>reviewed to provide that the death penalty may be imposed for the most serious 
</b></p>
<p><b>crimes only, namely, only for those crimes that involve intentional killing. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has been partially implemented. 
</p>
<p>7. <b>India should consider placing a moratorium on the death penalty in accordance 
</b></p>
<p><b>with General Assembly resolutions, with a view to abolishing it. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>
<p>8. <b>India should ensure that the registration of First Information Reports is 
</b></p>
<p><b>prompt and made mandatory in all cases of unlawful killings and death threats. The

<p>9. <b>India should ensure that command and/or superior responsibility is applied for

<p><b>violations of the right to life by security officers. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Violations of the right to life by non-State actors 
</b></p>
<p>10. <b>All vigilante groups and civilians recruited to perform military or law 
</b></p>
<p><b>enforcement tasks, and who are not part of the regular security forces, should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>dissolved and prohibited with immediate effect.

<p>Sufficient information has not been provided to enable assessment of progress. 
</p>
<p>11. <b>The protection of civilians in all instances of violence should constitute the 
</b></p>
<p><b>ultimate priority. All sides involved in armed activities should immediately cease 
</b></p>
<p><b>attacking civilians, including members of tribes and castes, human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p><b>and journalists. While having the duty to protect its people from the attacks 
</b></p>
<p><b>perpetrated by various non-State actors, the Indian authorities should ensure its acts 
</b></p>
<p><b>do not target civilians by any means, and are directed in a very precise manner at 
</b></p>
<p><b>neutralizing violent non-State actors.  
</b></p>
<p>Sufficient information has not been provided to enable assessment of progress. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Fight against impunity 
</b></p>
<p>12. <b>India should put in place a mechanism of regular review and monitoring of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>status of implementation of the directives of the Supreme Court and the National 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights Commission guidelines on arrest, encounter killings, and custodial 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence and death. 
</b></p>
<p>Sufficient information has not been provided to enable assessment of progress.

<p>Sufficient information has not been provided to enable assessment of progress. 
</p>
<p>14. <b>Compensation in cases of killings cannot play the role of replacement for 
</b></p>
<p><b>criminal prosecutions and punishment. Alongside payment of compensation to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>victims or their families, India should ensure that criminal investigations, 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecutions and trials are launched and conducted in a swift, effective and impartial 
</b></p>
<p><b>manner in all cases of unlawful killings, irrespective of the status of the perpetrator. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has been partially implemented. 
</p>
<p>15. <b>Promotions and other types of awards for security officers suspected to have 
</b></p>
<p><b>been involved in unlawful killings, including through encounters, should not be 
</b></p>
<p><b>granted until a proper clarification of facts.

</p>
<p>17. <b>The Nanavati-Mehta Commission, and all currently functioning commissions of 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>published in a swift and transparent manner. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>
<p>18. <b>India should consider launching a process of reflection upon the need to reform

</p>
<p>19. <b>A credible Commission of Inquiry into extrajudicial executions in India, or at 
</b></p>
<p><b>least the areas most affected by extrajudicial executions, which inspires the confidence 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the people, should be appointed by the Government. The Commission should also 
</b></p>
<p><b>serve a transitional justice role. It should (a) investigate allegations concerning past 
</b></p>
<p><b>and recent violations of the right to life; (b) propose relevant measures to tackle them; 
</b></p>
<p><b>and (c) work out a plan of action for the future to eradicate practices of extrajudicial 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>the reform of State structures, including security bodies; and (c) the fight against

<p>This recommendation has been partially implemented. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Killings of vulnerable persons 
</b></p>
<p>20. <b>The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>Christians. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has been partially implemented. 
</p>
<p>21. <b>The criminal legislation should be reviewed to ensure that all gender-based 
</b></p>
<p><b>killings, as well as killings of any member of a tribe or lower caste receive high 
</b></p>
<p><b>sentences, possibly under the form of life imprisonment. 
</b></p>

<p>22. <b>An effective witness and victim protection programme should be established. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>

<p><b>level of knowledge of human rights and access to justice of the public at large, with a 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular focus on vulnerable persons such as women and members of tribes and 
</b></p>
<p><b>lower castes. Legal aid mechanisms for these vulnerable persons should be devised to 
</b></p>
<p><b>enable them to seek protection, justice and redress in cases of violation of their rights. 
</b></p>
<p>Sufficient information has not been provided to enable assessment of progress. 
</p>
<p>24. <b>Increased sensitization and orientation programmes in respect of all forms of
