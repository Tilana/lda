<p><b>  Principles for responsible contracts: integrating the management of 
human rights risks into State-investor contract negotiations: guidance

</p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> Every business venture has the potential to have positive and negative impacts on 
people and human rights &#8211; those rights and freedoms that the international community has 
agreed that people need in order to live with dignity. In some cases, where the potential 
positive and negative human rights impacts of a venture are direct and significant, 
managing human rights risks will be an essential consideration to be included at the earliest 
stages of the life cycle of the venture. This is the case where the project presents either 
large-scale or significant social, economic or environmental risks or opportunities, or 
involves the depletion of renewable or non-renewable natural resources. 
</p>
<p> In such cases, irrespective of the sector involved, the negotiation process between a 
host State and a business investor offers a unique opportunity to identify, avoid and 
mitigate human rights risks. This will help optimize the full range of benefits to be drawn 
from the investment and help ensure the potential negative impacts on people are avoided 
or mitigated. Moreover, these principles will help ensure that States maintain adequate 
policy space in the investment contract, including for the protection of human rights, while 
avoiding claims relative to the contract in binding international arbitration. 
</p>

</p>
<p> The 10 principles that can help guide the integration of human rights risk 
management into contract negotiations are listed below: 
</p>
<p> 1. Project negotiations preparation and planning: The parties should be 
adequately prepared and have the capacity to address the human rights implications of 
projects during negotiations. 
</p>
<p> 2.  Management of potential adverse human rights impacts: Responsibilities for 
the prevention and mitigation of human rights risks associated with the project and its 
activities should be clarified and agreed before the contract is finalized. 
</p>
<p> 3. Project operating standards: The laws, regulations and standards governing 
the execution of the project should facilitate the prevention, mitigation and remediation of 
any negative human rights impacts throughout the life cycle of the project.  
</p>
<p> 4. Stabilization clauses: Contractual stabilization clauses, if used, should be 
carefully drafted so that any protections for investors against future changes in law do not 
interfere with the State&#8217;s bona fide efforts to implement laws, regulations or policies in a 
non-discriminatory manner in order to meet its human rights obligations.  
</p>
<p> 5. &#8220;Additional goods or service provision&#8221;: Where the contract envisages that 
investors will provide additional services beyond the scope of the project, this should be 
carried out in a manner compatible with the State&#8217;s human rights obligations and the 
investor&#8217;s human rights responsibilities.  
</p>
<p> 6. Physical security for the project: Physical security for the project&#8217;s facilities, 
installations or personnel should be provided in a manner consistent with human rights 
principles and standards. 
</p>
<p> 7. Community engagement: The project should have an effective community 
engagement plan through its life cycle, starting at the earliest stages.  
</p>
<p> 8. Project monitoring and compliance: The State should be able to monitor the 
project&#8217;s compliance with relevant standards to protect human rights while providing 
necessary assurances for business investors against arbitrary interference in the project. 
</p>
<p> 9. Grievance mechanisms for non-contractual harms to third parties: Individuals 
and communities that are impacted by project activities, but not party to the contract, 
should have access to an effective non-judicial grievance mechanism. 
</p>
<p> 10. Transparency/Disclosure of contract terms: The contract&#8217;s terms should be 
disclosed, and the scope and duration of exceptions to such disclosure should be based on 
compelling justifications.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. About this guide  
</b></p>
<p>1. This guide identifies 10 key Principles to help integrate the management of human 
rights risks into investment project contract negotiations between host State entities and 
foreign business investors.  
</p>
<p>2. The guide is the product of four years of research and inclusive, multi-stakeholder 
dialogue carried out under the Mandate of the Special Representative of the United Nations 
Secretary-General for Business and Human Rights, Professor John Ruggie.  
</p>
<p>3.  Early on in his mandate, the Special Representative identified investment contracts 
as an important instrument through which States and businesses can affect the human rights 
impact of business operations. In 2007 he partnered with the International Finance 
Corporation to carry out the first empirical study of its kind, comparing contractual clauses 
that are meant to help investors mitigate the risk of changes in law&#8212;called stabilization 
clauses--across sectors and all regions of the world and looking at their potential 
implications for human rights.5 This research then served as the basis for more than 3 years 
of consultations on the human rights implications of investment contracts in venues around 
the globe. The SRSG convened formal and informal consultations and participated in other 
discussions in London, Johannesburg, Marrakech, Dakar, Paris, Washington DC and other 
cities, with business enterprises, State representatives, private and institutional lenders, 
private and institutional investors, civil society, academics, and private practitioners. These 
consultations were unprecedented in that they brought together human rights experts and 
negotiators representing business enterprises, States and others directly involved in 
facilitating and supporting investment projects , such as private and public lending 
institutions and development organizations. 
</p>
<p>4.  This guide is the fruit of that collective experience about how to work towards 
successful projects that bring benefits to people and appropriately manage any potential 
adverse impacts on them. It has been developed specifically for use by State and business 
negotiators. It should also be of interest to those who are not directly involved in the 
negotiation, such as oversight bodies, civil society organizations, individuals and 
communities where investment projects are implemented, institutional and private lenders 
and insurers. 
</p>
<p><b> B.  Definitions  
</b></p>
<p>5. A &#8220;state-investor contract&#8221; is a contract made between a host State and a foreign 
business investor or investors. The types of contracts relevant to this guide are those in 
resource exploration or exploitation such as in oil, gas or mining; large agricultural 
projects; infrastructure projects, such as for the construction of highways, railways, ports, 
dams; or those for the development and operation of water and sanitation systems.1  
</p>
<p>6. For the purposes of this guide, &#8220;State&#8221; refers to any State entity, national or local.  
</p>
<p>  
 1 While these Principles can hold relevance for any sector, certain aspects of service provision or 
</p>
<p>supply contracts have not been covered. For example, while potentially directly relevant to human 
rights, this document does not cover the human rights and contracting issues of tariff structures or 
supply issues for the provision of utilities, such as water or electricity. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>7. The term &#8220;business investor&#8221; refers to a foreign controlled business enterprise that is 
party to the negotiation of a state-investor contract and to the resulting contract itself. 
&#8220;Parties&#8221; refer to both the State and the business investor(s) who take part in the negotiation 
of a state-investor contract. &#8220;Lenders&#8221; is used to indicate those private, public and 
multilateral organizations that support investment projects with financing.  
</p>
<p><b> C.  Why this guide? 
</b></p>
<p>8. Every business venture has the potential to positively and negatively impact people 
and human rights&#8212;those rights and freedoms that the international community has agreed 
people need to live with dignity.2  
</p>
<p>9. Positive impacts of private investments can include, for example, improved basic 
services, employment opportunities and revenue generation that can help States to provide 
and maintain services. Negative impacts can include, for example, the temporary or 
permanent displacement of people without proper consultation and compensation; 
environmental damage or disturbance that can adversely impact food and water supplies, 
livelihoods or culturally significant locations or resources. 
</p>
<p>10. States and business investors alike have learned from experience that unaddressed 
adverse human rights impacts present significant risks for commercial projects, and reduce 
the potential for such ventures to be a positive benefit to society. In some cases, negative 
human rights impacts from projects have resulted in costly civil and criminal law suits; 
financial liabilities, such as delays in design, siting, permitting, construction, operation and 
expected revenues; problematic relations with local labor markets; higher costs for 
financing, insurance and security; as well as damage stemming from loss of trust, 
reputational deterioration and cancellation of the projects.  
</p>
<p>11. Some projects will have a higher potential for direct and significant positive and 
negative impacts on human rights than others. In particular, this is likely to be so in long-
term projects when they present large-scale or significant social, economic or 
environmental risks or opportunities or where they involve the depletion of renewable or 
non-renewable natural resources (see Figure 1).  
</p>
<p>12. While human rights risks should always be considered in the context of business 
ventures, in the cases listed above, where human rights risks are particularly relevant to the 
project, it is important to make human rights risk management an essential consideration 
for the project negotiation of the contract or agreement that establishes and governs the 
project. This will contribute to ensuring the long-term sustainability and success of the 
project.   
</p>
<p>  
 2 Human rights refers to internationally recognized human rights &#8211; understood, at a minimum, as those 
</p>
<p>expressed in the International Bill of Human Rights and the principles concerning fundamental rights 
set out in the International Labour Organization&#8217;s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights 
at Work. For more on human rights and the differentiated obligations and responsibilities for States 
and business enterprises, see Annex 1. See also the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights: Implementing the United Nations &#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; Framework, UN Doc. 
A/HRC/17/31 (21 March 2011). </p>

<p><b>  Figure 1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> D.  Why consider human rights risks in contract negotiations?  
</b></p>
<p>13. The experiences of both States and business investors point to the advantages of 
considering human rights risk early, before projects get underway and before adverse 
impacts occur. The negotiation is an opportune time to define the expectations and 
responsibilities of the parties regarding all kinds of risks, including those related to human 
rights. Moreover, the proper management of human rights risks will also have implications 
for other contractual issues, so it is best to consider them coherently along with economic 
and commercial issues. Lastly, considering human rights early will help ensure that States 
maintain adequate policy space in the investment contract, including for the protection of 
human rights, while avoiding claims relative to the contract in binding international 
arbitration.  
</p>
<p>14. As graphically illustrated in Figure 2, integrating human rights at the negotiation 
will: 
</p>
<p> (1)  Facilitate the early identification and early management of potential negative 
human rights impacts of the investment project;  
</p>
<p> (2) Help establish clear roles and responsibilities for the prevention and 
mitigation of potential impacts and the remediation of impacts when they occur; 
</p>
<p> (3) Help the parties make appropriate assessments and cost allocations for the 
prevention, mitigation and remedy of negative human rights impacts; 
</p>
<p> (4) Facilitate cooperation and effective management of issues as they arise 
throughout the life-cycle of the project 
</p>
<p> (5) Help increase the overall positive benefits of the project, including to human 
rights.  </p>

</p>
<p><b> E.  Ten key principles 
</b></p>
<p>15. This guide identifies 10 Principles to help States and business investors integrate 
management of human rights risks into investment project contract negotiations, together 
with their key implications as well as a recommended checklist for negotiations. The 
subject matter of each Principle is then explained briefly. Annex 1 offers more detailed 
information on the differentiated obligations and responsibilities of States and business 
enterprises with respect to human rights. Annex 2 summarizes the work of the UN Special 
Representative and the UN &#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; Framework. 
</p>
<p>16. While these Principles provide a starting point for better integrating concern for 
human rights into the contracting phase of State-investor investment projects, they do not 
replace the value of professional human rights expertise.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Ten principles for integrating the management of human 
rights risks into contract negotiations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Project negotiations preparation and planning 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Principle 1:  The parties should be adequately prepared and have the capacity to 
properly address the human rights implications of projects during negotiations. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Key implications of Principle 1 for the negotiations: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; The State should enter the negotiation with a clear idea of how the project 
objectives, opportunities and risks relate to its existing obligations to respect, protect 
and fulfil human rights.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The business investor should enter the negotiation with a clear idea of how the 
project objectives, opportunities and risks relate to its responsibility to respect 
human rights. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The State and the business investor should enter the negotiation aiming to ensure 
that adverse human rights impacts are avoided, mitigated or remedied throughout the 
life-cycle of the project. This should be the case even where a State participates as 
an investor or as a beneficiary to the project&#8217;s revenues or both.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The parties&#8217; should enter the negotiation with the appropriate information and access 
to expertise and negotiation support to pursue these aims, and the negotiating agenda 
should reflect them.  
</p>
<p><b>  Recommended checklist for Principle 1: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; The State representatives directly engaged in the negotiation are tasked to achieve a 
project agreement that will help secure potential positive human rights impacts from 
the project while contributing to the effective protection of human rights throughout 
the project&#8217;s life-cycle.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The representatives of the business investor directly engaged in the negotiation are 
tasked with pursuing a project agreement that will ensure that human rights are 
respected throughout the project&#8217;s life-cycle. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Both parties have access to expertise that will allow them to make informed 
decisions regarding how best to allocate responsibilities for the prevention, 
mitigation and remedy of negative human rights impacts in the context of the 
project. For example, both parties are equipped to understand the potential financial 
and legal implications of different options proposed by either party. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The parties have ensured that their respective human rights obligations or 
responsibilities are reflected in the negotiating agenda. 
</p>
<p><b>  Brief explanation: Project negotiations preparation and planning 
</b></p>
<p>17. States can optimize the full range of benefits to be drawn from investment projects 
by ensuring that they have the knowledge and capacity to address the human rights 
implications of projects in a coherent way along side economic considerations. This 
requires meaningful preparation on human rights issues and the integration of such 
considerations in contract negotiations.  
</p>
<p>18. For States, the ministries, agencies or other authorities that deal with human rights-
related issues (such as health, education, housing, environment, justice) should be involved 
from the initial stages of a State&#8217;s planning for, or participation in, an investment project. 
For each project, States can facilitate their negotiation planning by identifying the positive 
benefits to human rights to be gained by a project as well as the risks to human rights that 
the project might pose. For example, infrastructure or mining projects may spur economic 
development in an area, creating employment opportunities or expanding access to food, 
healthcare or other basic necessities. Projects may also lead to the physical or economic 
displacement of people, risking their further impoverishment, and impeding their access to 
food, livelihood and healthcare.  
</p>
<p>19. On the part of business investors, the principle of respecting human rights while 
pursuing investment projects should be integrated into the project from conception, and 
reflected in the contract negotiation and throughout the life-cycle of the project. This may 
require adding human rights expertise, in particular to support their negotiating teams.  
</p>
<p>20. For both parties a range of expertise, including on human rights issues, will be 
required throughout the negotiation. Such expertise includes legal, technical, financial and 
commercial investment banking expertise--for example, to provide financial models so that 
parties can independently weigh up cost implications. The parties should ensure that their </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>negotiating teams have the capacity to provide this understanding. For States, there may be 
support available through international or bilateral development cooperation. 
</p>
<p><b> B.  Management of potential adverse human rights impacts 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Principle 2:  Responsibilities for the prevention and mitigation of human rights risks 
associated with the project and its activities should be clarified and agreed before the 
contract is finalized. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Key implications of Principle 2 for the negotiations: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; While more specific studies on potential adverse human rights impacts should occur 
throughout the life-cycle of the project, parties need to be aware of any potential 
adverse impacts that are foreseeable from feasibility studies, early impact 
assessments, due diligence assessments or other initial project preparation. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The parties need to have adequate expertise in order to identify and manage human 
rights risks throughout the project and before impacts occur, either by building their 
internal capacity or by securing external expertise.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensuring that adverse impacts can be prevented and mitigated requires that 
appropriate funds are available and allocated to enable the necessary measures to be 
taken.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Prevention and mitigation plans should be developed by including information and 
insight gained through community engagement efforts with those who may be 
adversely impacted. 
</p>
<p><b>  Recommended checklist for Principle 2: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; The contract clearly delineates who is responsible and accountable for mitigating the 
risks of adverse human rights impacts, as well as for how mitigation efforts will be 
financed.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The parties either agree on a set of human rights baselines--measurements of the 
state of human rights enjoyment before a project begins, or agree how such baselines 
will be established before project work begins. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Parties have assessed their own capacity to fulfill their responsibilities related to the 
management of human rights risks under the agreement.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Parties have ensured that funding for mitigation efforts will be available when 
needed, setting up special financial mechanisms with independent or joint 
accountability structures where appropriate . 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Before the contract is finalized, the parties have agreed on an initial plan to 
communicate with potentially impacted individuals and communities regarding risks 
of adverse impacts from the project in order to involve them in the development of 
prevention and mitigation plans.   
</p>
<p>&#8226; If the project foresees a special financial mechanism for compensation, there is 
agreement on how information about both its existence and ongoing management 
will be shared with potential beneficiaries. (see Principle 7) 
</p>
<p><b>  Brief explanation: Management of potential adverse human rights impacts 
</b></p>
<p>21. To be able to prevent and mitigate potential adverse human rights impacts, States 
should ensure these are assessed from the project&#8217;s earliest stages through its life-cycle, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>including the final stages such as decommissioning, abandonment or rehabilitation of the 
sites. For the business investor, it is important to complete a first assessment as early as 
possible in the context of a new activity, even before contract negotiation, to aid its 
understanding of the potential risks and benefits to people posed by the project from the 
outset.  
</p>
<p>22. Assessments should draw on credible internal or independent external human rights 
expertise and involve meaningful consultation with potentially impacted individuals and 
communities as well as other relevant stakeholders.  
</p>
<p>23. National laws, local laws, lending standards or other external benchmarks may 
establish certain requirements for assessing impacts, or human rights prevention and 
mitigation measures. These may be part and parcel of social and environmental impact 
assessments or part of other risk assessments or stand-alone requirements. But to ensure the 
clarity of roles and responsibilities among the parties, the contract should delineate 
responsibility for: (1) carrying out periodic assessments of actual and potential adverse 
human rights impacts3; (2) devising and carrying out a prevention and mitigation plan for 
potential negative impacts; and (3) ensuring funds for such activities will be guaranteed and 
administered as planned.   
</p>
<p>24. Parties might consider setting up special financial mechanisms with independent or 
joint accountability to ensure that adequate resources are available to carry out prevention 
and mitigation plans as required. Proper structures and oversight for the collection and use 
of the funds, in particular transparent financial mechanisms, are necessary to the credibility 
of the mechanisms, to support good governance and to minimizing risks or allegations of 
corruption.  Making financial mechanisms transparent can also be a useful way to reassure 
impacted communities that appropriate plans are in place to prevent and mitigate potential 
harms and build trust in the project. 
</p>
<p><b> C.  Project operating standards 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Principle 3:  The laws, regulations and standards governing the execution of the 
project should facilitate the prevention, mitigation and remediation of any negative 
human rights impacts throughout the life cycle of the project.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Key implications of Principle 3 for the negotiations: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; The parties are aware of any legislative, regulatory and enforcement gaps, and are 
prepared to work to identify whether or how they can be overcome. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The parties should supplement local laws, regulations and standards with external 
standards not currently incorporated into domestic law 4 where these can facilitate 
the prevention, mitigation and remediation of negative human rights impacts 
throughout the life cycle of the project. 
</p>
<p>  
 3 The assessment of human rights impacts need not be a distinct process from other types of 
</p>
<p>assessments made, such as environmental and social, as long as it is appropriate to identify human 
rights risks. 
</p>
<p> 4 &#8221;External standards&#8221; refers to standards not currently incorporated into domestic law, such as those 
created by lenders, international industry bodies or other good practice or internationally recognized 
guidelines or standards. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Recommended checklist for Principle 3: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; The State representatives responsible for negotiating the contract have consulted 
with relevant ministries or agencies who can advise on any current laws relevant for 
safeguarding human rights, on their adequacy for managing the risks posed by the 
project, and on the State&#8217;s capacity for enforcement. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The operating standards necessary for the protection of human rights throughout the 
life of the project have been agreed between the parties, including any external 
standards (financial, industrial, environmental or other) necessary to supplement 
applicable domestic laws or standards that relate to human rights. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The parties have ensured that all operating standards, including any external 
standards necessary to supplement domestic standards, apply to successors5 and sub-
contractors. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The parties have agreed to methods for: (1) ensuring compliance with the relevant 
external standards; (2) managing conflicts between domestic law and external 
standards should they arise; and (3) ensuring that project governance allows for 
updates in standards as they evolve.  
</p>
<p><b>  Brief explanation: Project operating standards 
</b></p>
<p>25. In most countries, a variety of laws and policies directly or indirectly require that 
businesses act with respect for human rights. These may include laws or policies on non-
discrimination, labor, environment, health, property, mining and anti-bribery. Such laws 
and policies are an important foundation of ensuring the prevention and mitigation of 
negative human rights impacts in the context of projects. However domestic frameworks 
may lack laws and policies governing certain project activities. Or there may be more 
nuanced legal gaps such as a lack of clarity on entitlement to occupy or dispose of land. 
There also may be gaps in State capacity even where laws and regulations exist, preventing 
States from having the means to effectively monitor and ensure compliance of investment 
projects with applicable domestic laws and policies.  
</p>
<p>26. Deficiencies in domestic laws and policies and their implementation are not just 
problematic for States and people impacted by projects. They create a difficult situation for 
business investors given their need to ensure that projects can be carried out in a manner 
that prevents and mitigates both potential harms to people and resulting risks to the investor 
itself.  
</p>
<p>27. To mitigate such obstacles, parties can supplement domestic laws with relevant 
external standards (such as those created by lenders, international industry bodies or other 
good practice or internationally recognized guidelines), and include them explicitly in the 
contract. This can help to build shared expectations for the parties to the investment and 
sub-contractors, as well as provide visibility, predictability and a common benchmark of 
performance for external interested bodies, such as lenders and insurers. It may also help to 
equip the State with adequate standards for overcoming its own gaps in domestic laws, 
policies and capacity to monitor compliance. 
</p>
<p>28. To be effective, the parties should ensure that the supplementary external standards 
are appropriate to the local context. For example, good practice technical standards on safe 
blasting from another State may not be useful where the local construction techniques 
differ.

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>29. Furthermore, as successor companies and sub-contractors may be involved in the 
project at different stages of its life-cycle, the parties should ensure that all the relevant 
standards, including any external standards, also apply to these entities. 
</p>
<p>30. The contract should indicate how monitoring and compliance with supplementary 
standards aimed at protecting human rights will be assured. In particular, relevant State 
agencies should be equipped with knowledge and training to be able to credibly monitor 
compliance with the full range of standards included in the contract. For example, if the 
contract - in line with international lending standards - requires environmental and social 
impact assessments before significant activities are carried out, the State must ensure that it 
has the capacity to effectively review, evaluate and to take appropriate and timely action on 
these assessments. Where the State currently lacks the capacity to carry out monitoring, the 
contract should provide for alternatives, at least on a temporary basis, such as self-reporting 
or other external credible verification.

<p><b> D.  Stabilization clauses</b>6<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Principle 4:  Contractual stabilization clauses</b>7<b>, if used, should be carefully drafted so 
that any protections for investors against future changes in law do not interfere with 
the State&#8217;s <i>bona fide</i> efforts to implement laws, regulations or policies, in a non-
discriminatory manner, in order to meet its human rights obligations.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Key implications of Principle 4 for the negotiations: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; It is legitimate for business investors to seek protections against arbitrary or 
discriminatory changes in law. However, stabilization clauses that &#8220;freeze&#8221; laws 
applicable to the project or that create exemptions for investors with respect to future 
laws, are unlikely to satisfy the objectives of this Principle where they include areas 
such as labor, health, safety, the environment, or other legal measures that serve to 
meet the State&#8217;s human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Stabilization clauses, if used, should not contemplate economic or other penalties for 
the State in the event that the State introduces laws, regulations or policies which: 
(a) are implemented on a non-discriminatory basis; and (b) reflect international 
standards, benchmarks or recognized good practices in areas such as health, safety, 
labor, the environment, technical specifications or other areas that concern human 
rights impacts of the project. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Where they are used, mechanisms to manage the material and economic impacts on 
an investor of non-discriminatory changes in law should be carefully designed to 
mitigate the specific risks to which the investor is exposed.8 Such mechanisms 
should not undermine the State&#8217;s <i>bona fide</i> efforts to meet its human rights 
obligations. 
</p>
<p>  
 6 This text on stabilization clauses deals solely with the human rights implications raised by such 
</p>
<p>clauses and is not intended to provide guidance on any other issues related to stabilization. 
 7 &#8220;Stabilization clauses&#8221; refers to any clause that addresses the issue of changes in the law during the

<p>term of the contract, including those that seek to maintain the project&#8217;s &#8220;economic equilibrium&#8221; or 
those that freeze the applicable law to a project. &#8220;Economic equilibrium&#8221; is used to refer to those 
clauses that seek indemnification or compensation in one form or another from the State for the costs 
of compliance with changes in law. 
</p>
<p> 8 For example, in the case of fixed-tariff industries, measures would be designed to help manage the 
impacts of costs associated with implementing new laws related to the particular difficulties of the 
industry and fixed tariff structure. </p>

<p><b>  Recommended checklist for Principle 4: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; The State and the business investor have understood the relationship between 
stabilization clauses and the State&#8217;s human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Where the parties have agreed to use a stabilization clause, the State&#8217;s negotiating 
team is charged with ensuring that the clause is consistent with the State&#8217;s human 
rights obligations, meaning that it does not create obstacles to the State's <i>bona fide 
</i>efforts to introduce and implement laws, regulations or policies in a non-
discriminatory manner to meet the State's human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The business investor has ensured that the contractual protections against future 
changes in law affecting its investment cannot create obstacles to the State&#8217;s <i>bona 
fide </i>efforts to discharge its obligations with respect to human rights in a non-
discriminatory manner. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The investor has anticipated in its own project plan that human rights-related laws, 
policies and regulations applicable to the project may evolve throughout the 
project&#8217;s life cycle and this has been factored into its project and financial planning. 
</p>
<p><b>  Brief explanation: Stabilization clauses 
</b></p>
<p>31. Contractual stabilization clauses aim to mitigate the risks to business investors from 
changes in law. Not all investment contracts have these provisions, but research shows that 
where they do exist the breadth of their application, and their provisions for mitigating the 
impacts of new laws on investors, vary greatly.9   
</p>
<p>32. Business investors view project financing predictability and consistency as a 
primary concern, as most large investments are long term and of an irreversible nature. This 
makes them vulnerable to changes in the rules governing their projects over time. For 
example, mining projects are tied to the location of the natural resource and much of the 
infrastructure for extraction is immovable, such that investors who successfully explore for 
minerals or oil are vulnerable to unilateral changes in local rules once the initial risk of 
investment has been taken. In fixed-tariff industries, investors may be limited in how they 
can absorb the costs of new laws and regulations, so they view mitigating this risk as 
particularly relevant. 
</p>
<p>33. Lenders to investment projects view stabilization clauses as a way to ensure certain 
benefits to the project, such as a guarantee that the State will not enact laws that make loan 
repayments more difficult. Particularly for projects with non-recourse financing (that is, 
where loans are repaid from project revenues), stabilization clauses may be considered 
important. Some States see stabilization clauses as a way to provide assurances aimed at 
encouraging inward investment.  
</p>
<p>34. However, the comparative research carried out by the Special Representative 
showed that, depending on the way the stabilization clause was drafted, it may have the 
potential to unduly constrict the policy space States need to meet their human rights 
obligations. The research found that those contracts negotiated with developing country 
governments were (1) typically much broader in their coverage than those agreed with 
developed country governments; and (2) they were much more likely to include exemptions 
for or award compensation to business investors for compliance with future laws--even in

<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>areas that are directly related to protecting human rights, such as health, environmental 
protection, labor and safety.  
</p>
<p>35. States fulfill their human rights obligations in part by passing and implementing 
legislative measures in a broad spectrum of areas such as health, safety, labor, 
environmental protection, security, and non-discrimination. Therefore, where stabilization 
clauses are used, it is important that States maintain the latitude for adopting and fully 
implementing such legislative measures.  
</p>
<p>36. A primary driver for the inclusion of stabilization clauses in state-investor contracts 
is often a concern on the part of business investors to have predictability in the fiscal laws 
and regulations applicable to the project. Fiscal constraints have been the subject of 
attention in recent years by academics, industry associations, civil society and others, given 
the perception that these have given rise to renegotiation demands by States. 
</p>
<p>37. Where fiscal terms are the driver for stabilization, it may be possible to reduce the 
interest in stabilization clauses by addressing the fiscal concerns of both business investors 
and States. For example, fiscal terms can be designed to allow some flexibility to adjust to 
external conditions over the life of the project, such as commercial risks and project 
operating costs, fluctuations in commodity prices, and changes in the business operating 
environment.10 This type of arrangement, when properly designed, can provide States and 
business investors with long-term fiscal certainty, lessening the interest in stabilization 
clauses and therefore their potential to interfere with the State&#8217;s policy space needed to 
meet its human rights obligations.  
</p>
<p>38. Additionally, necessary investor protection against arbitrary and discriminatory 
changes in law can be fashioned to not interfere with the State&#8217;s <i>bona fide </i>efforts to meet its 
human rights obligations.  In certain circumstances, in particular for fixed-tariff projects, 
the parties to the contract can integrate a number of mechanisms to manage the material and 
economic consequences of changes in the law. These can specify procedures to facilitate 
the efficient and effective resolution of issues as they arise, such as formula for appropriate 
risk-sharing or procedures and requirements for the parties to negotiate in good faith 
regarding mitigating any impacts of changes in the law.  Such mitigation measures or 
agreed procedures should be guided by the key implications and the recommended check 
list set out above and in particular should not undermine the State&#8217;s <i>bona fide</i> efforts to 
meet its human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>39. Finally, if parties include stabilization provisions in contracts, they should be drafted 
with a view to the broader legal context and other relevant contract provisions, which might 
influence the efficacy and appropriateness of the stabilization clause itself. Relevant factors 
include the potential applicability of international investment treaties, relevant avenues for 
dispute resolution, as well as the choice of law for the contract and provisions on methods 
of dispute resolution.  
</p>
<p>  
 10 If the parties are considering this idea, at least three issues should be highlighted: (1) the realities of 
</p>
<p>the State&#8217;s current and projected ability to administer more sophisticated fiscal regimes; (2) the 
challenges of offering non-standardized regimes and administering purpose-built fiscal regimes for 
the current and future projects in the State, and (3) the impact of any fiscal regime on the speed with 
which a State receives revenues. </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>  Principle 5:  Where the contract envisages that investors will provide additional 
services beyond the scope of the project, this should be carried out in a manner 
compatible with the State&#8217;s human rights obligations and the investor&#8217;s human rights 
responsibilities. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Key implications of Principle 5 for the negotiations:  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; The provision of additional goods or services risks a blurring of roles, 
responsibilities and accountability for their quality and sustainability between the 
parties.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; States maintain their human rights obligations when they contract with investors for 
the delivery of additional goods or services. Investors&#8217; responsibility to respect 
human rights applies to this additional provision of goods or services. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Expectations regarding such goods and services and their sustainability throughout 
the project&#8217;s life-cycle need to be aligned among all relevant parties.  Efforts to align 
expectations may be necessary.   
</p>
<p>&#8226; Assessments of human rights risks and the design of prevention and mitigation 
measures for the project should include any risks flowing from the business 
investor&#8217;s provision of additional goods and services. 
</p>
<p><b>  Recommended checklist for Principle 5: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; The State is aware of the costs of requiring investor-provided additional goods or 
services, including any impacts on the timing and amount of expected project 
revenues.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The contract clearly sets out the standards that will apply to the provision of 
additional goods or services. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The parties have agreed how the sustainability of additional goods and services will 
be assured, if relevant, beyond the project life-cycle, and how impacted individuals 
and communities will be informed of the plans for the sustainability of the goods or 
services. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The parties have identified who is responsible for ensuring the effectiveness of the 
additional goods or services, and for performing adequate oversight and monitoring 
of such goods or services. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The parties&#8217; prevention and mitigation plans regarding potential adverse human 
rights impacts cover any risks arising from additional goods and service provision 
by the business investor. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The contract requires that the community engagement plan for the project includes 
community engagement regarding the provision of additional goods and the creation 
and ongoing management of such additional services (see Principle 7).  
</p>
<p>  
 11 &#8220;Additional goods or service provision&#8221; refers to any good the business investor provides and any 
</p>
<p>service it carries out to the benefit of the State, local communities or other people in the State, where 
these goods and services are not related to any project activity and do not constitute measures to 
prevent, mitigate or remediate potential or actual adverse human rights impacts of the project.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p><b>  Brief explanation: Additional goods or service provision12 
</b></p>
<p>40. In some cases, States require investors to provide non-commercial services or 
infrastructure, such as schools, healthcare services, roads or other, that are not essential to 
either carrying out the project or mitigating project impacts. In these cases, the State is 
effectively contracting out for such goods or services, but it does not relinquish its human 
rights obligations by doing so.13 The investors&#8217; responsibility to respect human rights also 
applies to the provision of goods or services even where these are additional to the project 
and the investor&#8217;s core business activity. 
</p>
<p>41. States should therefore consider carefully whether and how to contract out for these 
goods or services. First, they should verify that such arrangements are an effective way of 
fulfilling human rights given the specific details of each case. States should consider (1) 
any opportunity costs of not pursuing a public tendering process to obtain such goods or 
services; (2) the impact, if any, that investor-provided services may have on the 
sustainability of such goods or services; and (3) the risks that such arrangements can create 
by blurring the roles and responsibilities between the State and the business investor, in 
particular in relation to beneficiaries of such goods or services. 
</p>
<p>42. If additional goods or services are under consideration in a state-investor contract 
negotiation, the collateral human rights implications should be reviewed during the 
negotiation. A lack of clarity from the perspective of beneficiaries as to the State&#8217;s and 
business investor&#8217;s respective roles may lead to unrealistic or misplaced expectations and 
create unintended animosities. Consistent with earlier principles, parties should agree on the 
approaches to prevent or mitigate human rights risks connected with the provision of 
additional goods or services at the time of contracting. The contract should reflect 
expectations regarding the quality and effectiveness of any goods or services to be 
provided; agreement on compliance with applicable laws and standards and accountability; 
and agreement on how the sustainability of services, where appropriate, will be managed 
beyond the life-cycle of the project, for example by designing a transition plan from the 
investor to the State or another provider as early as possible.  
</p>
<p><b> F.  Physical security for the project 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Principle 6: Physical security for the project&#8217;s facilities, installations or personnel 
should be provided in a manner consistent with human rights principles and 
standards. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Key implications of Principle 6 for the negotiations: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; The provision of physical security for investment projects, irrespective of private or 
State provision of security services, requires clarity of roles, responsibilities and 
</p>
<p>  
 12 It is not uncommon for States to require wider public use of infrastructure or services, such as 
</p>
<p>electricity or roads or rail lines that are established by the business enterprise to run projects. This 
type of leveraging of services or infrastructure can be an important contribution to enhancing the 
enjoyment of human rights and fostering broader economic development in the region impacted by 
the project. The human rights obligations and responsibilities of the parties also apply in these 
contexts. However, leveraging services and infrastructure built for projects does not pose the same 
risks as when business investors are required to provide services that are unrelated to their business 
venture, their project objectives and their expertise. 
</p>
<p> 13 Guidance from international sources on human rights standards can offer useful benchmarks and 
parameters for performance on issues such as accessibility, affordability, adequacy and quality of 
services. For example, see: http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/treaty/index.htm.  </p>

<p>accountability and should in all cases be carried out in compliance with 
internationally recognized principles on human rights and humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The level of physical security envisioned for projects has to be carefully considered, 
and where security is needed, parties should create clear written protocols to manage 
security provisions, aimed at avoiding and mitigating any related human rights risks 
and remediating any abuses that occur, including through a credible grievance 
mechanism.  
</p>
<p><b>  Recommended checklist for Principle 6: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; The State and business investor have identified human rights risks, as well as 
potential criminal and civil liabilities involved in the provision of physical security 
for the project. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The parties have agreed protocols for the management and implementation of 
security services throughout the project that (1) address how to involve local law 
enforcement or other relevant public officials; (2) address how to coordinate private 
and public security services; and (3) are in line with internationally recognized 
human rights law and humanitarian law relevant to the management and 
implementation of security.14  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The parties have agreed that an operational-level grievance mechanism will be 
available to address grievances regarding the provision of security services and 
activities (see Principle 9). Such grievance mechanism will not prejudice or hinder 
access to other state-based or non-state based grievance mechanisms such as those 
provided by regional bodies or UN treaty body mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The parties have agreed that community engagement plans will include engagement 
with local individuals and communities on issues related to security (see Principle 
7). 
</p>
<p><b>  Brief explanation: Physical security for the project 
</b></p>
<p>43. Some of the most serious human rights abuses in the context of business activity 
have involved security personnel charged with protecting business installations or 
operations. These security personnel could be local police, armed forces or private security 
personnel. Episodes of violence, especially when they are not followed by appropriate 
investigation, prosecution and remedy for those who have suffered from negative human 
rights impacts, pose legal, reputational and financial risks for States and business investors. 
State representatives, the directors of businesses and possibly the business investor itself 
can be accused of criminal behavior for carrying out or being complicit in human rights 
abuses.15 Therefore the failure to set clear responsibilities and expectations related to the 
physical security of investment projects during the negotiation poses serious risks to all 
involved.

<p>44. It may not be possible to identify all security needs at the contracting stage, and 
security arrangements may have to be agreed with local officials, military personnel, or 
others who are not involved in the negotiation of the deal. However, protocols and 
approaches for managing physical security for the project should be agreed at the 
contracting stage and further developed through the life cycle of the project.  
</p>
<p>45. When identifying risks, the current security profile of the area where the investment 
will take place should be considered as well as potential migration flows to or from the area 
that may result from the project. For example, existing and/or potential ethnic or religious 
conflict, poverty, unresolved land claims, criminality, conflict over resources, terrorism, 
and political insurgency will all be relevant factors. The security implications should be 
fully integrated in any risk assessment and should be reflected in the contract where 
appropriate. 
</p>
<p>46. Based on initial security assessments, the parties can agree the level of security 
provision needed for the project; the rules of engagement between parties; and how the 
involvement of other relevant officials, institutions or organizations will be facilitated. The 
standards agreed upon should be compatible with human rights and humanitarian law 
standards. The Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights and the Basic Principles 
on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials and the Code of Conduct 
for Law Enforcement Officials are useful reference documents.  The parties should also 
ensure the availability of a project-level grievance mechanism for alleged harms to local 
communities and individuals from security services (see Principle 9), and should agree how 
best to engage with local communities on the specific issue of security provision.

<p><b> G.  Community engagement 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Principle 7:  The project should have an effective community engagement plan 
through its life-cycle, starting at the earliest stages of the project.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Key implications of Principle 7 for the negotiations: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Both the State and business investor should view community engagement as 
fundamental aspects of creating common expectations for the project, and mitigating 
risks for themselves, for the project and for individuals and communities impacted 
by the project. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The community engagement plan should be inclusive with clear lines of 
responsibility and accountability. It should be initiated as soon as practicable. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Consultation with impacted communities and individuals should take place before 
the finalization of the contract.   
</p>
<p>&#8226; Disclosure of information about the project and its impacts is an integral part of 
meaningful community engagement. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The history of any previous engagement efforts carried out by either of the parties 
with the local community regarding the investment project needs to be known by 
both parties in order to take this into account in planning.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Community engagement plans should be aligned at a minimum to the requirements 
of domestic and international standards. For example, free prior informed consent or 
consultation with those potentially impacted may be required. </p>

</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Potentially impacted communities and individuals have been identified to the extent 
practicable before the contract is finalized. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Parties have agreed on the scope of community engagement and have agreed to their 
respective roles, responsibilities and accountability for these efforts. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Parties have agreed on methods of communicating to impacted communities 
information that is relevant to their human rights, while adequately protecting 
proprietary information.   
</p>
<p>&#8226; To the extent possible at the contracting stage, the community engagement plan has 
been properly costed and resourced. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The parties have shared information regarding any previous community engagement 
efforts concerning the project and have agreed how information gathered through 
future community engagement will be shared. 
</p>
<p><b>  Brief explanation: Community engagement 
</b></p>
<p>47. Effective and ongoing community engagement from the initial stages of investment 
projects is now widely recognized as minimum good practice for successful projects. It is 
the best way to identify and understand potential negative human rights impacts and 
identify effective preventative and mitigation measures. Effective engagement helps to 
manage expectations and foster trust of local communities &#8211; both of which are particularly 
important in the context of long-term investments.  
</p>
<p>48. Effective engagement is inclusive and designed to facilitate the involvement of all 
relevant individuals and groups, paying attention to gender differences and to those at 
heightened risk of vulnerability or marginalization.  For example, in places where men may 
speak for a family or group, it might be more difficult to learn about risks specific to 
women. Specialized approaches should be developed to understand such risks, and they 
should be explored from the earliest stages of project execution. For instance, where 
women are in charge of collecting water for the family, men consulted may not identify the 
relocation of a community well as having a serious potential impact, whereas it may be 
critical to the women&#8217;s ability to continue to access water safely and as needed. 
</p>
<p>49. It may not be possible to include detailed plans for engagement in the contract because 
these will be developed in part with entities and people who may not be party to the 
negotiation. For example, those individuals and communities who will be impacted (see 
Principle 2) and perhaps local or regional authorities will contribute to the creation of 
detailed engagement plans.  However, the State and the business investor can define their 
expectations and responsibilities for carrying out community engagement at the time of 
contracting.  For example, the parties can agree (1) that a plan for engagement will be 
developed in an inclusive manner before project activities impacting local individuals or 
communities begin, (2) that specific prevention and mitigation measures will be developed, 
where possible, with those at risk of being impacted, and (3) to minimum criteria for 
effective engagement.   
</p>
<p>50. Sharing information with individuals and communities potentially impacted by the 
project on the prevention and mitigation of potential negative impacts should be viewed as 
integral to the overall community engagement plan&#8212;including information on security, 
access to a project-level grievance mechanism and contract terms . Disclosure of 
monitoring reports, reports on measures to prevent and mitigate adverse impacts and other 
information relevant to human rights will keep people informed about the project and how 
it might impact their lives (see Principle 10). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p>51. At the time of contract negotiation, State or local authorities may have already 
facilitated engagement efforts. Typically, the business investor will have engaged with 
individuals and communities potentially impacted by the project, at least as part of initial 
feasibility or due diligence studies. These activities should be communicated during 
negotiations. The parties should identify what efforts have been made to engage with 
individuals and communities potentially impacted by the project, the successes or 
challenges of such efforts, and what steps have already been taken that may have caused 
community concern or interest (such as plans to resettle people or actual resettlement ahead 
of contract negotiation). Sharing such information is important for the design of future 
community engagement processes and can help both parties to foresee potential risks down 
the road.  
</p>
<p><b> H.  Project monitoring and compliance 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Principle 8: The State should be able to monitor the project&#8217;s compliance with 
relevant standards to protect human rights, while providing necessary assurances for 
business investors against arbitrary interference in the project. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Key implication of Principle 8 for the negotiations: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; The standards relevant to preventing, mitigating and remedying any adverse human 
rights impacts of the project need to be agreed in order for monitoring and 
compliance efforts to be effective (see Principle 3). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The State is responsible for ensuring compliance with such standards, whilst the 
business investor is responsible for adhering to the standards. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Where State capacity for monitoring compliance of the project with such standards 
is lacking, alternative agreed methods of monitoring and compliance should be 
substituted. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The contract should reflect the State&#8217;s right to monitor compliance with all relevant 
standards (such as technical, social, environmental, fiscal, financial and accounting 
standards), while at the same time integrating guarantees for business investors 
against arbitrary interference in the project. 
</p>
<p><b>  Recommended checklist for Principle 8: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; The contract assigns responsibility for compliance with agreed project standards.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The contract gives the State the necessary rights to ensure that the business investor 
is in compliance with agreed project standards, including ensuring State access to 
information and project sites reasonably required to ensure compliance. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Necessary guarantees are in place for the business investor against arbitrary 
interferences in the project. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The State has assessed its capacity and capabilities to monitor compliance 
effectively, identifying any gaps or weaknesses.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The contract identifies how gaps in capacity and capability to monitor compliance, 
where they exist, will be mitigated, for example via self-reporting requirements, 
external assistance or other means. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The State has properly costed its compliance monitoring role. </p>

</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Brief explanation: Monitoring and compliance 
</b></p>
<p>52. Irrespective of contractual undertakings, States have obligations to protect human 
rights and to ensure respect for their laws. One way States fulfill these obligations is by 
ensuring compliance with project standards .  When capacity to enforce compliance is 
lacking, States should consider obtaining outside expertise. While this can require 
significant resources, especially for poorer States, the investment should be money well 
spent because it will help ensure the full range of economic and social benefits of the 
project are realized. These efforts may be supported through development cooperation. 
</p>
<p>53. The State must ensure that it has appropriate rights to carry out all necessary 
compliance monitoring work, such as rights to access to information and project operations, 
either directly or through third parties. Where State capacity is lacking, parties can agree on 
other methods such as self-reporting, the use of external monitoring, and so forth.  
Likewise, the contract should reflect the business investor&#8217;s obligation to cooperate with 
such compliance work. Necessary guarantees for the business investor against arbitrary 
interference by the State in the project operations should be provided. 
</p>
<p><b> I.  Grievance mechanisms for non-contractual harms to third parties 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Principle 9: Individuals and communities that are impacted by project activities, but 
not party to the contract, should have access to an effective non-judicial grievance 
mechanism. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Key implication of Principle 9 for the negotiations:  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; The contract should ensure that individuals and communities who are impacted 
negatively by the project have access to an effective operational-level grievance 
mechanism enabling grievances to be lodged and addressed at an early stage.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Operational-level grievance mechanisms should not prejudice or restrict access to 
State-based or other non-State based complaint mechanisms, including judicial 
mechanisms, or mechanisms provided by project lenders, regional tribunals or other. 
</p>
<p><b>  Recommended checklist for Principle 9: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; The contract requires that individuals or communities who allege that they have 
suffered harm in the context of project activities will have access to an effective 
non-judicial grievance mechanism. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The grievance mechanisms will comport with the effectiveness criteria for non-
judicial grievance mechanisms contained in the UN Guiding Principles on Business 
and Human Rights.16 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The parties have ensured that the grievance mechanism will not prejudice or restrict 
access to State-based or other non-State based complaint mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>  
 16 The Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights describe both State obligations and business 
</p>
<p>entity responsibilities regarding remedy. See specifically Guiding Principles 25 &#8211; 31 available at: 
http://www.business-humanrights.org/media/documents/ruggie/ruggie-guiding-principles-21-mar-
2011.pdf. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p><b>  Brief explanation: Grievance mechanisms for non-contractual harms to third parties 
</b></p>
<p>54. Even with the best contractual provisions and operating standards in place, any 
major investment project is likely to lead to some concerns and grievances among those 
directly affected about its perceived adverse impacts. These grievances may raise human 
rights issues, or, if neglected or poorly handled, may lead to escalating tensions and 
confrontations that in turn generate adverse human rights impacts. It is important to have a 
means to identify and effectively address such grievances. This is also part of the business 
investor&#8217;s responsibility to respect human rights, which requires that a business enterprise 
facilitate the remediation of human rights harms that it causes or contributes to, and that it 
establish or participate in an effective operational-level grievance mechanism in support of 
this objective. In this context, an &#8220;operational-level grievance mechanism&#8221; is a mechanism 
that will address grievances related specifically to the investment project or project 
activities.  
</p>
<p>55. Operational-level grievance mechanisms support the identification of adverse human 
rights impacts as a part of the business investor&#8217;s on-going human rights due diligence.17  
They also make it possible for grievances to be addressed and for adverse impacts to be 
remediated early and directly by the business investor, thereby preventing harms from 
compounding and grievances from escalating. (see Guiding Principle 29)18. Such 
mechanisms should not impede access to remedy through judicial or other non-judicial 
processes available to individuals and communities impacted by the project.  
</p>
<p>56. As part of their duty to protect human rights, States must take appropriate steps to 
ensure, through judicial, administrative, legislative or other appropriate means, that when 
business-related adverse human rights impact occur within their territory and/or 
jurisdiction, those affected have access to effective remedy. In addition to providing these 
State-based mechanisms, States should consider ways to facilitate access to effective non-
State based grievance mechanisms (see Guiding Principles 28).19 Supporting the inclusion 
within the state-investor contract of a provision for an effective operational-level grievance 
mechanism can facilitate important opportunities for early remedy &#8211; or even prevention &#8211; of 
negative impacts on individuals and communities, without prejudice to their ability to 
access State-based mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>57. Both parties can therefore advance the efficient and effective remediation of harms 
if they come to the negotiation: (1) having identified whether an effective operational-level 
mechanism already exists or whether it will have to be established specifically for the 
project; and (2) with the aim of ensuring an operational-level grievance mechanism is made 
available to individuals and communities who may be adversely impacted by the project 
without prejudice to their ability to access State-based mechanisms. The contract should 
also reflect both parties&#8217; responsibility to fully participate in good faith in the mechanism. 
</p>
<p>58. If an effective mechanism does not exist prior to negotiation, before contract closure 
the parties should assign responsibility for ensuring that such a mechanism is established.

<p>Principle 28. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>23 
</b></p>
<p>The UN Guiding Principle 3120 sets out a number of criteria that non-judicial grievance 
mechanisms should meet in order to be effective, namely:  
</p>
<p> (a) Legitimate: enabling trust from the stakeholder groups for whose use they are 
intended, and being accountable for the fair conduct of grievance processes; 
</p>
<p> (b) Accessible: being known to all stakeholder groups for whose use they are 
intended, and providing adequate assistance for those who may face particular barriers to 
access; 
</p>
<p> (c) Predictable: providing a clear and known procedure with an indicative 
timeframe for each stage, and clarity on the types of process and outcome available and 
means of monitoring implementation; 
</p>
<p> (d) Equitable: seeking to ensure that aggrieved parties have reasonable access to 
sources of information, advice and expertise necessary to engage in a grievance process on 
fair, informed and respectful terms; 
</p>
<p> (e) Transparent: keeping parties to a grievance informed about its progress, and 
providing sufficient information about the mechanism&#8217;s performance to build confidence in 
its effectiveness and meet any public interest at stake; 
</p>
<p> (f) Rights-compatible: ensuring that outcomes and remedies accord with 
internationally recognized human rights; 
</p>
<p> (g) A source of continuous learning: drawing on relevant measures to identify 
lessons for improving the mechanism and preventing future grievances and harms; 
</p>
<p>Operational-level mechanisms should also be: 
</p>
<p> (h) Based on engagement and dialogue: consulting the stakeholder groups for 
whose use they are intended on their design and performance, and focusing on dialogue as 
the means to address and resolve grievances. 
</p>
<p>59. The parties should view the operational-level grievance mechanism as an important 
complement to wider community engagement and collective bargaining processes, where 
relevant, but not as a substitute for any of these. 
</p>
<p><b> J.  Transparency/Disclosure of contract terms 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Principle 10:  The contract&#8217;s terms should be disclosed, and the scope and duration of 
exceptions to such disclosure should be based on compelling justifications.21  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Key implications of Principle 10 for the negotiations: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Contract terms, with exceptions for compelling justifications, should be disclosed in 
an accessible manner and seen as part of the community engagement plan for the 
project.   
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Principle31. 
 21 Disclosure of information related to the project throughout its life cycle allows people to have 
</p>
<p>information that is pertinent to them and their human rights. Transparency of project information 
throughout its life cycle should be considered as part of the ongoing community engagement plan 
(See Principle 7). Initiatives like the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and some lending 
standards offer additional benchmarks on disclosure that can be useful reference points for parties.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>24</b>  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Exceptions to the disclosure of contract terms should be based on compelling 
justifications, such as business proprietary information or information that could 
directly impact the position of one of the parties in a concurrent or imminent 
negotiation. Exceptions to disclosure should be time-bound to fit the compelling 
justification.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Where there are exceptions to disclosure, the subject matter of the excluded 
clause(s) should be identified, along with their expected release date. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Applying disclosure requirements to all business investors equally can contribute to 
alleviating business investors&#8217; concerns regarding competitiveness. 
</p>
<p><b>  Recommended checklist for Principle 10: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; The State has considered how it can facilitate disclosure of contract terms, for 
example by standardizing disclosure rules for all business investors. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The parties have agreed to disclose the contract terms and identified the exceptions, 
if any. Those are made for particular clauses or subjects where there are compelling 
justifications. The parties have agreed to a reasonable time frame for keeping 
exceptions confidential. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The contract requires that where clauses are kept confidential, the subject matter of 
the excepted clause(s) is disclosed, along with the expected release date. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; If disclosure of contract terms poses costs or risks, measures to resource or mitigate 
these have been agreed between the parties before the finalization of the contract.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The contract delineates responsibility for making the contract terms accessible. The 
contract requires publication in an accessible manner, taking into account possible 
barriers to access such as linguistic, technological, financial, administrative, legal or 
other practical constraints. 
</p>
<p><b>  Brief explanation: Transparency/disclosure of contract terms 
</b></p>
<p>60. States should disclose information when the public interest is impacted&#8212;this is the 
case when it comes to investment projects which present either high risk or high rewards 
for human rights. Contract disclosure is one way the State and business investors can 
pursue their respective human rights obligations and responsibilities. States can facilitate 
disclosure by standardizing disclosure rules amongst competitors.  
</p>
<p>61. There can be a number of costs associated with not disclosing. For example, the 
State and the business investor may spend time and resources handling civil society 
complaints, stakeholder and other requests for disclosure or even campaigns calling for 
transparency. Furthermore, lack of disclosure can contribute to a loss of trust among 
interested individuals and communities in the project and even between the parties.   
</p>
<p>62. Appropriate disclosure of the contract terms allows both parties to communicate 
transparently with those who will be impacted by the project and to ensure that expectations 
correspond to what has been agreed. In this way it can reduce suspicion regarding the 
fairness of the contract terms and guard against unrealistic demands. Thus, disclosure of 
contract terms should be viewed as one part of any community engagement plan (see 
Principle 7). Disclosure of the contract also promotes accountability of both parties to 
implement the promises agreed in the contract and notifies third parties of the rights and 
obligations of the parties to the contract. Therefore disclosing the contractual terms can 
promote trust in the investment project and the parties to the investment.   
</p>
<p>63. While there are legitimate reasons to keep a level of confidentiality during the 
negotiations, broad confidentiality provisions relative to the finalized contractual terms will </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>25 
</b></p>
<p>not satisfy the objectives of this Principle.  Exceptions to disclosure should be based on 
compelling justifications, such as business proprietary information or information that 
could compromise the negotiating position of either party for an imminent or concurrent 
negotiation. The parties should come to the negotiation with an idea of the types of 
information, if any, they believe fall within these parameters, along with a proposed time 
period for which the information should remain confidential.  When the contract terms are 
disclosed, the subject matter of the excepted clause(s) should be identified, along with their 
expected release dates. 
</p>
<p>64. Finally, meaningful transparency requires information to be accessible - meaning 
that it can be obtained without legal and administrative barriers, financial obstacles or 
discriminatory denials of access. Therefore, the disclosure of contractual terms should 
include making them readily available to interested parties, and may require translating 
them into local languages and making them available free of charge. In some contexts 
posting the contractual clauses on the internet may work. In others this would not be 
appropriate without ensuring that people without access to the internet have an opportunity 
to obtain the information. Making contractual terms accessible may require some resources, 
which should be considered an integral part of costs of the project. Before contract closure 
the parties should agree how the contractual terms will be released in an accessible manner. </p>

<p><b>Appendix I 
</b></p>
<p><b>  State&#8217;s human rights obligations and business enterprise&#8217;s 
responsibility to respect human rights 
</b></p>
<p> &#8220;Human rights&#8221; is a collective term for what the international community has agreed 
are the fundamental rights and freedoms people need to live with dignity. They are often 
expressed and guaranteed by law, including through international agreements and 
customary international law.  
</p>
<p> Human rights cover civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights such as the 
protection of the life, liberty and physical security of the individual, as well as rights 
relating to the workplace, to family life, access to housing, food, water, health care, 
education, and participation in cultural life. 
</p>
<p> State and companies have differentiated yet complementary roles vis-&#224;-vis human 
rights: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; States have a broad set of international human rights law obligations which require 
that they respect, protect (with regard to any other third party) and fulfill the human 
rights of individuals within their territory and/or jurisdiction. Regarding human 
rights abuses caused by third parties, States have a duty to protect against such 
abuses, including those by business, through appropriate policies, regulation, and 
adjudication; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Business enterprises have a responsibility to respect human rights, which in essence 
means to act with due diligence to avoid infringing on the rights of others and to 
address adverse human rights impacts with which they are involved.22 They may do 
many things beyond respecting rights that contribute to the enjoyment of rights, such 
as promoting human rights or contributing to their fulfilment, for instance by 
supporting health or educational programs. But these actions do not offset a failure 
by a business to respect human rights throughout its operations and such positive 
behavior is not the equivalent of preventing, mitigating and remedying adverse 
human rights impacts. For example, the harm caused by polluting water source is 
not balanced or cancelled out in some way because the investment project also 
brought in a road or a school to a community.

<p><b>Appendix II 
</b></p>
<p><b>  About the work of the Special Representative 
</b></p>
<p> This document has been developed by the Special Representative of the United 
Nations Secretary-General on the Issue of Human Rights and Transnational Corporations 
and Other Business Enterprises, Professor John Ruggie. The Special Representative was 
appointed by then UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan in 2005 and Ban-Ki Moon continued 
the appointment. 
</p>
<p> In 2008, the Special Representative presented the &#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; 
Framework (known now as the UN Framework) to the UN Human Rights Council. It 
clarifies State and business responsibilities and provides a foundation on which thinking 
and action can build over time. 
</p>
<p> The &#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; Framework rests on three pillars: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; the State duty to protect against human rights abuses by third parties, including 
business, through appropriate policies, regulation, and adjudication; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; the corporate responsibility to respect human rights, which means to act with due 
diligence to avoid infringing on the rights of others and to address adverse impacts 
that occur; and 
</p>
<p>&#8226; greater access by victims to effective remedy, both judicial and non- judicial. 
</p>
<p> The UN Framework is intended to work dynamically, and no one pillar can carry the 
burden on its own. The State duty to protect and the corporate responsibility to respect exist 
independently of one another, and preventative measures differ from remedial ones. Yet, all 
are intended to be mutually reinforcing parts of a dynamic, interactive system to advance 
the enjoyment of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>  The State duty to protect 
</b></p>
<p> The first pillar is the <b>State duty to protect</b> against human rights abuses committed 
by third parties, including business, through appropriate policies, regulation and 
adjudication.  It highlights that States have the primary role in preventing and addressing 
corporate-related human rights abuses. The Special Representative documented the duty&#8217;s 
legal foundations, policy rationales and scope in his 2008 and 2009 reports to the Human 
Rights Council, available through his website.  
</p>
<p> Although States interact with business in numerous ways, many currently lack 
adequate policies and regulatory arrangements for effectively managing the complex 
business and human rights agenda. While some States are moving in the right direction, 
overall State practice exhibits substantial legal and policy incoherence and gaps, which 
often entail significant consequences for victims, companies and States themselves. The 
most common gap is failing to enforce existing laws. In addition, legal and policy 
incoherence can result from departments and agencies which directly shape business 
practices &#8211; including corporate law and securities regulation, investment, export credit and 
insurance, and trade &#8211; working in isolation from their government&#8217;s own human rights 
obligations and agencies. 
</p>
<p> Greater policy coherence is also needed at the international level. States do not leave 
their human rights obligations behind when they enter multilateral institutions that deal 
with business-related issues. States should encourage those bodies to institute policies and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>28</b>  
</p>
<p>practices that promote business respect for human rights. Additionally, capacity-building 
and awareness-raising through such institutions can play a vital role in helping all States to 
fulfil their duty to protect. 
</p>
<p> The Special Representative has proposed a number of measures that States can take 
to promote corporate respect for human rights and prevent corporate-related human rights 
abuse. They relate to clarifying general State regulatory and policy functions; promoting 
respect for human rights through the State-Business nexus, such as when State agencies 
provide business with substantial support and services; supporting business-respect for 
human rights in conflict affected areas; and ensuring policy coherence at home and abroad. 
Under Guiding Principle 9, the final element includes States maintaining adequate domestic 
policy space to meet their human rights obligations when pursuing business-related policy 
objectives with other States or business enterprises, for instance through investment treaties 
or contracts.  
</p>
<p><b>  The corporate responsibility to respect 
</b></p>
<p> The <b>corporate responsibility to respect</b> human rights means acting with due 
diligence to avoid infringing on the human rights of others and addressing adverse human 
rights impacts with which they are involved. It exists independently of States&#8217; abilities 
and/or willingness to fulfil their own human rights obligations, and does not diminish those 
obligations. And it exists over and above compliance with national laws and regulations 
protecting human rights.  
</p>
<p> The responsibility to respect human rights requires that business enterprises: (a) 
avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts through their own activities, 
and address such impacts when they occur; and (b) seek to prevent or mitigate adverse 
human rights impacts that are directly linked to their operations, products or services by 
their business relationships, even if they have not caused those impacts. 
</p>
<p> Companies can affect virtually the entire spectrum of internationally recognized 
rights. Therefore, the corporate responsibility to respect applies to all such rights (although 
in practice, some rights will be more relevant than others in particular industries and 
circumstances). At a minimum, this means looking to the International Bill of Human 
Rights (comprising the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International 
Covenants on Civil and Political Rights, and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), and 
the principles concerning fundamental rights in the eight ILO core conventions as set out in 
the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. These are the benchmarks 
against which other social actors assess the human rights impacts of business enterprises. 
</p>
<p> How does a company avoid infringing on human rights, and mitigate adverse 
impacts? What is needed is human rights due diligence. Human rights due diligence is a 
potential game changer for companies: from &#8220;naming and shaming&#8221; to &#8220;knowing and 
showing.&#8221; Naming and shaming is a response by external stakeholders to the failure of 
companies to respect human rights. Knowing and showing is the internalization of that 
respect by companies themselves through human rights due diligence.  
</p>
<p> Companies routinely conduct due diligence to satisfy themselves that a 
contemplated transaction has no hidden risks. Drawing on the features of well-established 
practices and combining them with what is unique to human rights, the Special 
Representative has laid out the basic parameters of a human rights due diligence process. 
Because this process is a means for companies to address their responsibility to respect 
human rights, it has to go beyond simply identifying and managing material risks to the 
company itself, to include the risks a company&#8217;s activities and associated relationships may 
pose to the rights of affected individuals and communities.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>29 
</b></p>
<p> Based on a statement of commitment to respect human rights and supporting 
policies, the core elements of human rights due diligence include assessing actual and 
potential human rights impacts, integrating and acting upon the findings, tracking 
responses, and communicating how impacts are addressed. Moreover, where business 
enterprises identify that they have caused or contributed to adverse impacts, they should 
provide for or cooperate in their remediation through legitimate processes. 
</p>
<p><b>  Access to Effective Remedy 
</b></p>
<p> Even where institutions operate optimally, adverse human rights impacts may still 
result from a company&#8217;s activities and victims must be able to seek redress. Thus the third 
pillar of the U.N. Framework addresses the need for enhancing access to effective remedies 
for those whose human rights are impacted by corporate activities. The Special 
Representatives has focused on three categories of grievance mechanisms through which 
individuals and communities with human rights-related complaints against companies can 
be addressed: judicial; state-based non-judicial; and non-state based non-judicial 
mechanisms.  
</p>
<p> States are encouraged to consider a coordinated system of remedy for victims of 
corporate-related human rights abuse, including both judicial and non-judicial options as 
appropriate. Currently, access to judicial mechanisms for business-related human rights 
claims is often most difficult where the need is greatest as a result of both legal and 
practical obstacles. And there is an uneven patchwork of non&#8208;judicial mechanisms at the 
national and international levels.  
</p>
<p> Operational-level grievance mechanisms play an important role, performing two key 
functions that also relate to the corporate responsibility to respect. First, they serve as early 
warning systems, providing companies with information about their impacts; second, these 
mechanisms make it possible for grievances to be addressed and remediated directly, 
thereby preventing harm from being compounded and grievances from escalating. In 
addition, collaborative initiatives undertaken by industry bodies, multi-stakeholder groups, 
international organizations and regional human rights systems can complement operational-
level and State-based mechanisms. <b> 
</b></p>
<p> Non&#8208;judicial mechanisms, whether State&#8208;based or independent, should conform 
to principles of legitimacy, accessibility, predictability, rights&#8208;compatibility, equitability, 
transparency and continuous learning. Company&#8208;level mechanisms should also operate 
through dialogue and engagement rather than the company itself acting as adjudicator. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  The Guiding Principles 
</b></p>
<p> The Human Rights Council endorsed the Framework unanimously in 2008, and 
asked the Special Representative to provide additional concrete guidance on its 
operationalization. The Special Representative has responded with a set of Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights, published in March 2011.   The Guiding 
Principles seek to provide for the first time an authoritative global standard for preventing 
and addressing the risk of adverse human rights impacts linked to business activity. The UN 
Human Rights Council will consider formal endorsement of the text at its June 2011 
session. Key elements of the Framework and Guiding Principles have already been 
incorporated into ISO26000 (the new social responsibility standard adopted by more than 
90 percent of member bodies of the International Organization of Standards), and the 
OECD Guidelines for Multinational Corporations, to which more than 40 States adhere.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>30</b>  
</p>
<p> The Guiding Principles are the product of six years of research and extensive 
consultations involving governments, companies, business associations, civil society, 
affected individuals and groups, business investors and others around the world. They 
outline how States and businesses should implement the UN Framework in order to better 
manage business and human rights challenges.  
</p>
<p> The Guiding Principles <i>highlight what steps States should take </i>to foster business 
respect for human rights; <i>provide a blueprint for companies </i>to know and show that they 
respect human rights, and reduce the risk of causing or contributing to human rights harm; 
and constitute a set of <i>benchmarks for stakeholders </i>to assess business respect for human 
rights. The principles are organized under the UN Framework&#8217;s three pillars as described 
above. <b>

<p><b>  The Special Representative&#8217;s investment contracts work 
</b></p>
<p> Early on in his mandate, the Special Representative identified investment contracts 
as an important context to explore. In 2007 he partnered with the International Finance 
Corporation to carry out the first empirical study comparing stabilization clauses across 
sectors and all regions of the world and looking at their implications for human rights. This 
research served as the basis for two more years of consultations on investment contracts 
and human rights. Formal and informal consultations were held around the globe, including 
in London, Johannesburg, Marrakech, Dakar, Paris, and Washington DC, with a wide group 
of stakeholders from all regions of the world, representing governments, business entities, 
financial institutions, commercial practitioners and civil society.  
</p>
<p> The outcome of this extensive consultation was wide-ranging support for the Special 
Representative to provide further guidance on stabilization but also on other issues relating 
to human rights and State-investor contracts. In developing this guidance, the Special 
Representative has continued to consult widely with stakeholders from all relevant 
perspectives to ensure that they are a useful learning tool for States, business investors and 
other interested parties.  
</p>
<p> This guide represents one way in which the Special Representative is fulfilling the 
request from the UN Human Rights Council to provide views and concrete 
recommendations on how States can meet their duty to protect and how businesses can 
pursue their responsibility to respect human rights.
