<p><b>A/HRC/19/46/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>2</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>In a note verbale dated 15 December 2011, the Permanent Mission of Cuba, 
recalling the obligations of Israel under international law and relevant Security Council 
</p>
<p>resolutions, stressed that Israel continued to violate its obligations. The Permanent Mission 
</p>
<p>of Cuba recognized the important efforts of the United Nations to end the occupation of the 
</p>
<p>Syrian Golan by Israel and denounced the role of the United States of America in 
</p>
<p>marginalizing Security Council decisions and its double standards in the application of 
</p>
<p>Council decisions on humanitarian interventions. The Permanent Mission of Cuba 
</p>
<p>reaffirmed the right of the Syrian Arab Republic over the occupied Golan Heights and 
</p>
<p>requested the unconditional withdrawal of Israel from this and all other occupied Arab 
</p>
<p>territories. It recalled the position of the Non-Aligned Movement that the decision by Israel 
</p>
<p>to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan was null 
</p>
<p>and void and without international legal effect, including Israeli settlements, which 
</p>
<p>constitute a violation of international law and relevant treaties. In that regard, the 
</p>
<p>Permanent Mission of Cuba stressed that Israel must comply with Security Council 
</p>
<p>resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 497 (1981). The Permanent Mission of Cuba further 
</p>
<p>recalled the support of the Non-Aligned Movement for full Syrian sovereignty over the 
</p>
<p>occupied Golan in accordance with the Arab Peace Initiative, the Madrid peace process, the 
</p>
<p>principle of territory for peace and relevant Security Council resolutions. The Permanent 
</p>
<p>Mission of Cuba also emphasized that Israel must comply with the Geneva Conventions. It 
</p>
<p>particularly condemned the brutal practices in Israeli prisons and the inhuman conditions of 
</p>
<p>detention therein. The Permanent Mission of Cuba urged Israel to reopen the access point in 
</p>
<p>Al Qunaytirah in order to facilitate the access of Syrian civilians of Golan to Syrian 
</p>
<p>territory.
