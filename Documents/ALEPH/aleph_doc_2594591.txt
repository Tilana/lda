Seventy Seven Energy Inc. Announces
Second Quarter 2016 Operational and Financial Results
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, August 9, 2016 - Seventy Seven Energy Inc. (“SSE”) today
reported financial and operational results for the second quarter of 2016. Key information related
to SSE for the second quarter is as follows:
•Emerged from bankruptcy on August 1, 2016, which reduced debt by $1.115 billion
•Net Loss of $84.5 million
•Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $31.5 million
•8 rigs currently operating in the Permian; over 30 new customers in the first half of the year
SSE reported total revenues of $138.1 million for the second quarter of 2016, an 11% decrease
compared to revenues of $155.4 million for the first quarter of 2016, and a 53% decrease
compared to revenues of $295.1 million for the second quarter of 2015.
Net loss for the second quarter of 2016 was $84.5 million, or $1.53 per fully diluted share,
compared to net loss of $59.6 million, or $1.09 per fully diluted share, for the first quarter of 2016
and net loss of $74.7 million, or $1.50 per fully diluted share, for the second quarter of 2015.
SSE’s adjusted EBITDA was $31.5 million for the second quarter of 2016, compared to adjusted
EBITDA of $37.9 million for the first quarter of 2016 and adjusted EBITDA of $44.3 million for the
second quarter of 2015.
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of this measure to
comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”) is provided on pages 9 - 12 of this release.
“We are pleased to have completed the prepackaged restructuring of our balance sheet while
experiencing no disruption to our operations throughout the process. This $1.115 billion
reduction in our debt provides us with the ability to take advantage of our operational strengths
and strong asset base to grow our business when market conditions improve,” Chief Executive
Officer Jerry Winchester said.
“While we are seeing early signs of activity levels improving, we would caution that we have yet
to see pricing respond. We remain focused on tightly managing our costs while continuing to
operate safely and efficiently for our customers. Our continued emphasis on service quality is
reflected in our diverse customer base, including over 30 new customers added to our portfolio in
the first half of 2016.”
Drilling
SSE’s drilling segment contributed revenues of $62.8 million and adjusted EBITDA of $40.6
million during the second quarter of 2016, compared to revenues of $71.9 million and adjusted
EBITDA of $46.0 million for the first quarter of 2016 and revenues of $100.4 million and adjusted
EBITDA of $45.7 million for the second quarter of 2015. The decrease in revenues for the second
quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2016 was primarily due to an 18% decline in
revenue days (which is the aggregate number of days each active rig generated revenue).
The percentage of revenues from non-CHK customers decreased from 39% to 37% of total
segment revenues for the second quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2016. SSE’s
drilling segment generated revenues related to idle-but-contracted payments from CHK of $35.3
million and $36.2 million, respectively, during the second and first quarters of 2016. Excluding
the idle-but-contracted revenues, the Company has diversified its customer base in the drilling
segment and increased non-CHK revenue from 79% in the first quarter of 2016 to 85% in the
second quarter of 2016. As of June 30, 2016, approximately 71% of
1
SSE’s active rigs were contracted by non-CHK customers and SSE had a total drilling revenue
backlog of $220.1 million with an average duration of 11 months.
As a percentage of drilling revenues, drilling operating costs were 37% for the second quarter of
2016, 38% for the first quarter of 2016 and 57% for the second quarter of 2015. Operating costs
were $23.0 million during the second quarter of 2016, compared to $27.2 million for the first
quarter of 2016 and $57.1 million for the second quarter of 2015. Average operating costs per
revenue day in the second quarter of 2016 increased 3% from the first quarter of 2016, primarily
due to fewer revenue days.
As of June 30, 2016, the Company’s marketed fleet consisted of 94 rigs, 74 of which are multi-
well pad capable.
Hydraulic Fracturing
SSE’s hydraulic fracturing segment contributed revenues of $66.9 million and adjusted EBITDA
of $2.8 million during the second quarter of 2016, compared to revenues of $76.3 million and
adjusted EBITDA of $6.5 million for the first quarter of 2016 and revenues of $163.4 million and
adjusted EBITDA of $24.3 million for the second quarter of 2015. The decrease in revenues from
the first quarter of 2016 to the second quarter of 2016 was primarily due to a 9% decrease in
revenue per stage. Revenues from non-CHK customers as a percentage of total segment
revenues decreased from 30% in the first quarter of 2016 to 21% in the second quarter of 2016.
As of June 30, 2016, SSE’s hydraulic fracturing revenue backlog was $89.8 million with an
average duration of 10 months.
As a percentage of hydraulic fracturing revenues, hydraulic fracturing operating costs were 96%
for the second quarter of 2016, 92% for the first quarter of 2016 and 86% for the second quarter of
2015. Average operating costs per stage in the second quarter decreased 5% from the first
quarter of 2016. The decrease in average operating costs per stage for the second quarter of
2016 compared to the first quarter of 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in labor-related costs.
As of June 30, 2016, SSE owned 13 hydraulic fracturing fleets with an aggregate of 500,000
horsepower operating in the Anadarko Basin and the Eagle Ford and Utica Shales.
Oilfield Rentals
SSE’s oilfield rentals segment contributed revenues of $8.4 million and adjusted EBITDA of $0.1
million during the second quarter of 2016, compared to revenues of $7.1 million and adjusted
EBITDA of ($1.7) million for the first quarter of 2016 and revenues of $17.8 million and adjusted
EBITDA of ($1.9) million for the second quarter of 2015. Revenues from non-CHK customers as
a percentage of total segment revenues decreased from 76% in the first quarter of 2016 to 48% in
the second quarter of 2016.
As a percentage of oilfield rental revenues, operating costs were 100% for the second quarter of
2016, 127% for the first quarter of 2016 and 114% for the second quarter of 2015. The decrease
in operating costs as a percentage of revenues was due to declines in labor-related costs and
sub-contracting services in the second quarter of 2016 compared to both prior periods.
Operating costs were $8.4 million during the second quarter of 2016, compared to $9.1 million for
the first quarter of 2016 and $20.2 million for the second quarter of 2015.
Former Oilfield Trucking
During the second quarter of 2015, SSE sold its drilling rig and logistics business and water
hauling assets. As of June 30, 2015, there were no remaining assets or operations in the oilfield
trucking segment, although we do have ongoing liabilities, primarily related to insurance claims,
whose income statement impact is charged to general and administrative expense.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $39.7 million in the second quarter of 2016,
compared to $22.3 million in the first quarter of 2016 and $34.8 million in the second quarter of
2015. General and administrative expenses for corporate functions settled in cash were $11.8
million in the second quarter of 2016, compared to $12.7 million in the first quarter of 2016 and
$23.1 million in the second quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to declines in
consulting fees.
2
SSE incurred restructuring charges of $23.5 million and $4.7 million in the second quarter of
2016 and first quarter of 2016, respectively. Additionally, general and administrative expenses
include non-cash compensation of $4.1 million, $4.5 million and $8.6 million, for the second
quarter of 2016, first quarter of 2016 and second quarter of 2015, respectively, and severance-
related costs of $0.3 million for both the second and first quarters of 2016 and $3.1 million for the
second quarter of 2015. Below is a breakout of general and administrative expenses incurred in
the second and first quarters of 2016 and the second quarter of 2015.

Liquidity
As of June 30, 2016, SSE had cash and short-term investments of $81.4 million and working
capital of $187.9 million. As of August 4, 2016, SSE had cash and short-term investments of
$50.3 million and the Company’s revolving credit facility remained undrawn. As of June 30, 2016,
SSE had $14.0 million of purchase commitments related to future capital expenditures that the
Company expects to incur during the second half of 2016.
Capital expenditures totaled $21.9 million for the second quarter of 2016, which primarily
consisted of investments in new PeakeRigs™. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, capital
expenditures totaled $76.1 million. SSE currently expects its total year-end 2016 capital
expenditures to be less than $100.0 million.
On June 7, 2016, the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries filed bankruptcy petitions for
reorganization under Chapter 11 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of
Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”). On July 14, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order
confirming the Plan. The Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries satisfied the remaining
conditions to effectiveness contemplated under the Company’s Joint-Prepackaged Plan of
Reorganization and emerged from Chapter 11 on August 1, 2016.
SSE expects its primary sources of liquidity will be from cash on hand and cash from operations.
In addition, the Company entered into a $100.0 million senior secured asset-based revolving
credit facility upon emerging from the Chapter 11 proceeding.
Conference Call Information
SSE does not plan to host an earnings conference call to discuss second quarter 2016
operational and financial results.

Forward-Looking Statements and Cautionary Statements
This news release (and any oral statements made regarding the subjects of this release,
including on the conference call announced herein) contains certain statements and information
that may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
3
amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts that address activities, events
or developments that the Company expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future
are forward-looking statements. The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “ensure,” “expect,” “if,” “intend,”
“plan,” “estimate,” “project,” “forecasts,” “predict,” “outlook,” “aim,” “will,” “could,” “should,”
“potential,” “would,” “may,” “probable,” “likely,” and similar expressions, and the negative thereof,
are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, forward-looking statements contained in this press release specifically include
statements, estimates and projections regarding the Plan of Reorganization and related matters,
as well as, the Company's business outlook and plans, future financial position and flexibility,
capital structure, liquidity and capital resources, acquisitions, returns, capital expenditure
budgets and other guidance regarding future developments. Forward-looking statements are not
assurances of future performance. These forward-looking statements are based on
management’s current expectations and beliefs, forecasts for its existing operations, experience,
and perception of historical trends, current conditions, anticipated future developments and its
effect on the Company, and other factors believed to be appropriate. Although management
believes that the expectations and assumptions reflected in these forward-looking statements are
reasonable as and when made, no assurance can be given that these assumptions are accurate
or that any of these expectations will be achieved (in full or at all). Moreover, the Company's
forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, many of which are
beyond its control, which may cause actual results to differ materially from its historical
experience and its present expectations or projections which are implied or expressed by the
forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, risks relating to
general economic and industry conditions; the terms and availability of any new debt; potential
adverse effects of the Chapter 11 proceedings on the Company’s liquidity, results of operations,
brand or business prospects; our customers’ drilling and completion expenditures; delays in or
failure of delivery of current or future orders of specialized equipment; the loss of or interruption in
operations of one or more key suppliers or customers; the effects of government regulation,
permitting and other legal requirements, including new legislation or regulation of hydraulic
fracturing; operating risks; the adequacy of our capital resources and liquidity; weather; litigation;
competition in the onshore oil and natural gas services industry; and costs and availability of
resources.
In addition, SSE calculates its contract drilling backlog by multiplying the day rate under its
contracts by the number of days remaining under the contract. The Company calculates its
hydraulic fracturing backlog by multiplying the (i) rate per stage, which varies by operating region
and is, therefore, estimated based on current customer activity levels by region and current
contract pricing, by (ii) the number of stages remaining under the contract, which it estimates
based on current and anticipated utilization of its crews. With respect to its hydraulic fracturing
backlog, the Company's contracts provide for periodic adjustments of the rates it may charge for
its services, which will be negotiated based on then-prevailing market pricing and in the future
may be higher or lower than the current rates it charges and utilizes in calculating its backlog.
The drilling backlog calculation does not include any reduction in revenues related to
mobilization or demobilization, nor does it include potential reductions in rates for unscheduled
standby or during periods in which the rig is moving, on standby or incurring maintenance and
repair time in excess of what is permitted under the drilling contract. The Company computes
average duration for its contract drilling backlog and hydraulic fracturing backlog as the average
number of months remaining for its drilling rigs under contract and its remaining hydraulic
fracturing fleets under contract, respectively.
For additional information regarding known material factors that could cause the Company's
actual results to differ from its present expectations and projected results, please see its filings
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its Current Reports on
Form 8-K that it files from time to time, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Annual Report on
Form 10-K.
Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement which
speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made. The Company undertakes no
obligation to correct, revise or update any forward-looking statement after the date such
statement is made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as
required by applicable law.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Adjusted EBITDA
“Adjusted EBITDA” is a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA as used and defined by
us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies and is not
a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income,
net income or loss, cash flows provided by operating, investing and financing activities, or other
income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. However, our
management uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our performance and liquidity and believes
Adjusted EBITDA may be useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance and
liquidity because this measure:
•
is widely used by investors in the oilfield services industry to measure a company’s operating
performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such measure, which can
vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods, book value
of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired, among other factors;
•
is a financial measurement that is used by rating agencies, lenders and other parties to evaluate
our creditworthiness; and
•
is used by our management for various purposes, including as a measure of performance of our
operating entities and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting.
There are significant limitations to using Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of performance,
including the inability to analyze the effect of certain recurring and non-recurring items that
materially affect our net income or loss. Additionally, because Adjusted EBITDA excludes some,
but not all, items that affect net income and is defined differently by different companies in our
industry, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of
other companies.

Prior to 2016, the information that was regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision
maker included general and administrative expenses that were allocated to each of our
reportable segments for corporate overhead functions provided by the Other Operations
segment, on behalf of our reportable segments. Effective January 1, 2016, we no longer
allocate general and administrative expenses to our reportable segments from the Other
Operations segment in the information that is reviewed by our chief operating decision maker.
Accordingly, this change has been reflected through retroactive revision of the prior period
segment information.
