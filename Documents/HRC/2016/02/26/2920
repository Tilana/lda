<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Guided </i>by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Geneva 
Conventions of 12 August 1949 and Additional Protocols I and II thereto of 1977, and other 
relevant instruments of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, 
as well as the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of 
civil political, economic, social and cultural rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>article 32 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 12 
August 1949 relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts, which 
recognizes the right of families to know the fate of their relatives, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also </i>that article 33 of Additional Protocol I provides that the parties to an 
armed conflict shall search for the persons who have been reported missing by an adverse 
party as soon as circumstances permit, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further </i>the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance, adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 61/177 of 
20 December 2006, article 24 (2) of which sets out the right of victims to know the truth 
regarding the circumstances of the enforced disappearance, the progress and results of the 
investigation and the fate of the disappeared person, and sets forth State party obligations to 
take appropriate measures in this regard, and the preamble to the Convention, which 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p>reaffirms the right to freedom to seek, receive and impart information to that end, and 
welcoming the entry into force of the Convention on 23 December 2010, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking into account </i>Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/66 of 20 April 
2005, Human Rights Council decision 2/105 of 27 November 2006, and Council 
resolutions 9/11 of 18 September 2008 and 12/12 of 1 October 2009 on the right to the 
truth, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking also into account </i>Human Rights Council resolutions 10/26 of 27 March 2009 
and 15/5 of 29 September 2010 on forensic genetics and human rights, in which the 
Council recognized the importance of the utilization of forensic genetics to deal with the 
issue of impunity within the framework of investigations relating to gross human rights 
violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the creation of the mandate of Special Rapporteur on the promotion of 
truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence by the Human Rights Council in 
its resolution 18/7 of 29 September 2011, and the appointment of a mandate holder by the 
Council at its nineteenth session, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting with interest</i> the general comment of the Working Group on Enforced or 
Involuntary Disappearances on the right to the truth in relation to enforced disappearance,  
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging </i>the reports of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights on the right to the truth1 and their significant conclusions relating to the 
right to know the truth about gross violations of human rights and serious violations of 
international humanitarian law, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging also </i>the report of the Office of the High Commissioner on the right 
to the truth2 and its conclusions regarding the importance of the protection of witnesses 
within the framework of criminal procedures relating to gross human rights violations and 
serious violations of international humanitarian law, as well as on issues relating to the 
elaboration and management of archive systems to guarantee the effective implementation 
of the right to the truth, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing </i>that adequate steps to identify victims should also be taken in situations 
not amounting to armed conflict, especially in cases of massive or systematic violations of 
human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>the set of principles for the protection and promotion of human rights 
through action to combat impunity,<footnote name="3">E/CN.4/Sub.<footnote name="2">A/HRC/12/19.  </footnote>/1997/20/Rev.1, annex II.  </footnote> and taking note with appreciation of the updated 
version of those principles,<footnote name="4">E/CN.4/2005/102/Add.1.  </footnote> 
</p>
<p><i>Noting </i>that the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers has 
recognized the right to the truth, its scope and implementation,<footnote name="5">E/CN.4/2006/52.  </footnote> and also that the Human 
Rights Committee and the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances 
have recognized the right of the victims of gross violations of human rights and the right of 
their relatives to the truth about the events that have taken place, including the identification 
of the perpetrators of the facts that gave rise to such violations,<footnote name="6">E/CN.4/1999/62. </footnote> 
</p>

<p><i>Acknowledging </i>in cases of gross violations of human rights and serious violations of 
international humanitarian law the need to study the interrelationship between the right to 
the truth and the right to access to justice, the right to obtain effective remedy and 
reparation and other relevant human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing </i>the importance for the international community to endeavour to recognize 
the right of victims of gross violations of human rights and serious violations of 
international humanitarian law, and their families and society as a whole, to know the truth 
regarding such violations, to the fullest extent practicable, in particular the identity of the 
perpetrators, the causes and facts of such violations and the circumstances under which they 
occurred, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing also </i>that it is important for States to provide appropriate and effective 
mechanisms for society as a whole and, in particular, for relatives of the victims to know 
the truth regarding gross violations of human rights and serious violations of international 
humanitarian law, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>that a specific right to the truth may be characterized differently in some 
legal systems as the right to know, the right to be informed, or freedom of information, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing </i>that the general public and individuals are entitled to have access, to 
the fullest extent practicable, to information regarding the actions and decision-making 
processes of their Government, within the framework of each State&#8217;s domestic legal 
system, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>the importance of preserving historic memory relating to gross human 
rights violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law through the 
conservation of archives and other documents relating to those violations, 
</p>
<p><i>Convinced </i>that States should preserve archives and other evidence concerning gross 
violations of human rights and serious violations of international humanitarian law to 
facilitate knowledge of such violations, to investigate allegations and to provide victims 
with access to an effective remedy in accordance with international law, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Recognizes </i>the importance of respecting and ensuring the right to the truth so 
as to contribute to ending impunity and to promote and protect human rights; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Welcomes </i>the establishment in several States of specific judicial mechanisms 
and other non-judicial mechanisms, such as truth and reconciliation commissions, that 
complement the justice system, to investigate violations of human rights and of 
international humanitarian law, and appreciates the elaboration and publication of the 
reports and decisions of these bodies; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Encourages </i>the States concerned to disseminate, implement and monitor 
implementation of the recommendations of such non-judicial mechanisms as truth and 
reconciliation commissions, and to provide information regarding compliance with the 
decisions of judicial mechanisms; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Encourages </i>other States to consider establishing specific judicial 
mechanisms and, where appropriate, truth and reconciliation commissions to complement 
the justice system, in order to investigate and address gross violations of human rights and 
serious violations of international humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Encourages </i>States and international organizations to provide requesting 
States with necessary and appropriate assistance regarding the right to the truth by means 
of, among other actions, technical cooperation and the exchange of information concerning 
administrative, legislative and judicial and non-judicial measures, as well as experiences 
and best practices that have as a purpose the protection, promotion and implementation of </p>


<p>this right, including practices regarding the protection of witnesses and the preservation and 
management of archives; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Encourages </i>States to design programmes and other measures to protect 
witnesses and individuals who cooperate with judicial bodies and mechanisms of a quasi-
judicial or non-judicial nature, such as human rights commissions and truth commissions; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Calls upon</i> States to work in cooperation with the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence in accordance with 
his mandate, including by extending invitations to the Special Rapporteur; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Welcomes </i>the entry into force of the International Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, and encourages all States that have 
not yet signed, ratified or acceded to the Convention to consider doing so; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Takes note with appreciation</i> of the report of the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights on the right to the truth7 and, in accordance with its 
conclusions, calls upon all States to consider developing comprehensive witness protection 
programmes covering all types of crimes, including gross human rights violations and 
serious violations of international humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Also takes note with appreciation </i>of the report of the Office of the High 
Commissioner on the seminar on experience of archives as a means to guarantee the right to 
the truth,8 which outlined the importance of archives to the ability of victims to realize their 
right to the truth, to judicial accountability and non-judicial truth-seeking processes, and for 
reparations, and, in accordance with its concluding observations, encourages States that 
have not yet done so to establish a national archival policy that ensures that all archives 
pertaining to human rights are preserved and protected, and to enact legislation that 
declares that the nation&#8217;s documentary heritage is to be retained and preserved, and creates 
the framework for managing State records from their creation to destruction or 
preservation; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to invite, from within existing 
resources, Member States, United Nations organs, intergovernmental organizations, 
national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations to provide 
information on good practices in the establishment, preservation and provision of access to 
national archives on human rights, and to make the information received publically 
available in an online database; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Invites </i>special procedures and other mechanisms of the Human Rights 
Council, in the framework of their mandates, to take into account, as appropriate, the issue 
of the right to the truth; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Decides </i>to consider this matter at its twenty-seventh session under the same 
agenda item, or at the corresponding session in conformity with its annual programme of 
work.
