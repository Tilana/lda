2016 Interim Results
Ferrexpo plc, a top three supplier of iron ore pellets to the global steel industry, today announces interim
results for the six months ended 30 June 2016.
Michael Abrahams, Non-Executive Chairman, said:
"We are pleased to report a good set of financial results given the challenging circumstances in the iron ore
industry. We have improved the quality of our pellet output, increased sales volumes to record levels and
significantly reduced our cost base. Cash generated from operating activities was US$142 million for the
period (up 61% compared to the first half of 2015) which allowed the Group to repay US$120 million of debt
amortisation in the first half of 2016.
The Group continues to control costs and to benefit from selling a premium product to the world's top steel
mills.  Pellet demand remains strong and Ferrexpo believes it is well placed to continue to generate positive
net operating cash flows throughout the commodities cycle."

Introduction
Ferrexpo's 2016 interim results demonstrate the strength of the business and its strategy enabling the Group
to report an EBITDA margin for the first half of 2016 in line with the first half of 2015 at 35% despite very
challenging industry conditions.
Weak industry prices, particularly in the first quarter of 2016, were offset by increased sales of higher quality
product and significantly lower costs allowing the Group to report EBITDA in the first half 2016 of US$160
million (US$16 million below the EBITDA of US$176 million reported for first half 2015). This strong
performance underpinned excellent net cash generation from operations which increased to US$142 million,
US$54 million higher than the first half of 2015, reflecting lower tax, interest and working capital.
During this period of near decade low iron ore prices, the Group reduced borrowing by US$120 million,
increased cash on hand by US$9 million and remains comfortably within the terms of its borrowing facilities.
The Board has not declared an interim dividend for the period (1H 2015: 3.3 US cents per Ordinary Share),
however, it may review this later in the year subject to the financial capacity of the Company and to market
conditions.
In July 2016, the Group made the final scheduled repayment of its US$420 million pre-export finance facility
which had been amortising in equal instalments over the past 24 months.
Pricing and Sales
In the first six months of 2016 the PLATTS CFR China iron ore fines price averaged US$52 per tonne
compared to an average of US$61 per tonne in the first half of 2015. The average price was slightly higher
than the average of US$51 per tonne in the second half of 2015. The market was, however, volatile with iron
ore trading within a wide range from an eight year low of US$38 per tonne in mid-December 2015 to a 15
month high of US$71 per tonne in April 2016. The average iron ore price in July 2016 was US$57 per tonne.
The pellet premium that the Group received in addition to the PLATTS fines price improved throughout the first
half of 2016 recovering from lows seen at the start of the year to finish the period more strongly. In China the
spot pellet premium traded at US$11 per tonne in January 2016 before recovering to US$22 per tonne in June
2016 (1H 2016 China spot average: US$17 per tonne; 1H 2015 China spot average: US$28 per tonne). The
headline long term contract pellet premium in the key markets of Western Europe and North East Asia was
slightly lower than the first half of 2015.
The Group's net realised FOB/DAP price was in line with the second half of 2015 reflecting a weak 
environment in the first quarter of the year before prices recovered in the second quarter of 2016 driven by
improved demand for iron ore and lower pellet availability. The Group's pricing benefitted from reduced C3
freight rates (1H 2016 US$7.1 per tonne vs. 1H 2015 US$10.8 per tonne) which increased its overall realised
price.
The Group achieved record sales volumes for a half year period with sales increasing 6% to 6.0 million tonnes
compared to 5.7 million tonnes in the first half of 2015. Ferrexpo continues to develop its customer portfolio
and successfully agreed its first long term contract in Korea during the period.
Sales of pellets exceeded production in the half year period, partially unwinding the build-up of pellet stocks in
the second half of 2015. The Group sold 244 thousand tonnes of stocks during the period and as of 30 June
2016 carried 479 thousand tonnes of pellet stocks.
Production Performance and Costs
Ferrexpo's operations successfully increased production of pellets from own ore by 4% to 5.7 million tonnes
(1H 2015: 5.5 million tonnes) while increasing production of premium 65% Fe pellet to 94% of total production
volumes, a record level for a half year period (1H 2015: 87% of total production volumes).
The Group remained one of the lowest cost pellet producers in the world in the first half of 2016.  Its C1 cash
cost of production fell by 23% or US$7.7 per tonne to US$25.7 per tonne compared to US$33.4 per tonne in
the first half of 2015.
Outlook
Ferrexpo is the third largest iron ore pellet exporter in the world by volume with a well invested long life asset,
a competitive cost base and a diversified high quality customer portfolio. The Group operates in a premium
sector of the iron ore market with high barriers to entry and is benefiting from its US$2 billion investment
programme since IPO in 2007.
The Group continues to control costs intensively through its business improvement programme and to benefit
from selling a niche product to key customers under long term contracts. Pellet demand remains strong and
the Group believes it is well placed to continue to generate positive net operating cash flows.
Financial Results
Revenue
Group revenue was US$458 million in the first half of 2016, 11% lower than the first half of 2015 (US$512
million) reflecting a lower iron ore price index which fell on average by 14% compared to the same period in
2015. Ferrexpo increased its sales volumes by 6% to 6.0 million tonnes (1H 2015: 5.7 million tonnes) while
the Group's net realised FOB/DAP price was in line with the second half of 2015 reflecting a weak
environment in the first quarter of the year before prices recovered in the second quarter of 2016 driven by
improved demand for iron ore and lower pellet availability. The Group's pricing benefitted from reduced C3
freight rates (1H 2016 US$7.1 per tonne vs. 1H 2015 US$10.8 per tonne) which increased its overall realised
price.   For further information see Market Environment and Marketing.
Costs
C1 Cost of Production
The Group's C1 cost of production reduced by US$7.7 per tonne to US$25.7 per tonne compared to US$33.4
per tonne in the first half of 2015.  Of this 23% cost reduction, approximately US$2.8 per tonne was driven by
mining efficiency gains (for further information see Production Costs), US$2.6 per tonne due to lower oil and
gas prices, and US$2.3 per tonne was due to the Hryvnia devaluation against the US Dollar.
In the first half of 2016, the average Hryvnia per US dollar was 25.47 compared to 21.43 in the first half of
2015, a 19% depreciation. The higher rate in the first half of 2016 reduced the C1 cash cost by 7% as
approximately 50% of the Group's cost to produce a pellet is in Hryvnia. This includes electricity, salary,
royalties, some consumable products, spare parts and materials.
Local cost inflation during the period was primarily driven by electricity price increases (+7% vs. average 1H
2015) following the devaluation of the Hryvnia against the US Dollar. Overall, these costs were still
significantly lower in US dollar terms in the first half of the year compared to the prior period. The table below
shows the year on year change in CPI for the first half of 2016. Inflation peaked in January 2016 at 40.3% and
thereafter CPI has slowed to 6.9% in June 2016.  For further information see Update on Risks: Ukrainian
Inflation.

The Group's C1 cost represents the cash cost of production for iron ore pellets, from own ore, divided by
production volume of pellets from own ore, and excludes non-cash costs such as depreciation, pension costs
and inventory movements as well as costs of purchased ore and concentrate and production cost of
gravel. Please see Note 3 of the accounts for a reconciliation of C1 Costs.
Selling and Distribution Costs
Selling and distribution costs decreased by 10% to US$101 million (1H 2015: US$113 million) as a result of
the depreciation of the Hryvnia against the US Dollar as well as lower international freight rates.
The cost to transport the Group's pellets to border points for international dispatch declined 15% to US$8.6 per
tonne (or US$52 million) compared to US$10.1 per tonne in the first half of 2015 (or US$57 million). All rail
costs are in local currency and the net reduction compared to the first half of 2015 is after taking into account
the Hryvnia depreciation against the US Dollar as well as a 15% increase in rail tariffs from May 2016.
International freight costs reduced to US$31 million in the first half of 2016 (1H 2015: US$36 million). This
was driven by lower oil prices and weaker freight rates due to depressed market conditions in the shipping
industry. For further information see Marketing.
Currency
Ferrexpo prepares its accounts in US Dollars. The functional currency of the Ukrainian operations is the
Hryvnia.
During the first half of 2016 the Hryvnia devalued from UAH24.00 per US Dollar as of 1 January 2016 to
UAH27.05 per US Dollar in February 2016 before appreciating to UAH24.85 per US Dollar as of 30 June
2016. Over half of the Group's total cost base, including inland logistics costs, are denominated in Hryvnia.

Balances at 30 June 2016 are converted at the prevailing rate. The devaluation of the currency since 31
December 2015 has resulted in a US$33 million reduction in the net assets of the Group and has been
reflected in the translation reserve.
Operating Profit from Continuing Operations before Adjusted Items
In the first half of 2016 Group revenue declined by US$54 million compared to the first half of 2015. The
reduction in revenue was largely offset by a US$44 million reduction in cost of sales and lower selling and
distribution, general and administrative and other expenses. As a result operating profit from continuing
operations before adjusted items was US$133 million in the first half of 2016 compared to US$142 million in
the first half of 2015.
EBITDA
EBITDA for the period was US$160 million compared to US$176 million in the first half of 2015. The fall in
iron ore prices during the period was offset by an improved sales mix, higher sales volumes and cost
reductions. The decline reflected lower operating foreign exchange gains compared to the prior year due to a
more stable Hryvnia against the US Dollar in the first half of 2016.1
1 The Group calculates EBITDA as profit from continuing operations before tax and finance plus depreciation and amortisation and
non-recurring exceptional items included in other income and other expenses, share based payment expenses and the net of gains
and losses from disposal of investments and property, plant and equipment. Please see Note 3 of the accounts for a reconciliation of
EBITDA.
Interest
Finance expense was in line with the first half of 2015 at US$38 million. This amount includes interest
expense on interest bearing loans of US$28 million compared to US$32 million in the first half of 2015.
Further details on finance expense are disclosed in Note 10 of the accounts.
The Group carried lower gross debt following the repayment of US$120 million of facilities over the period.
The average cost of debt for the period ended 30 June 2016 was 6.6% (30 June 2015: 5.32%; 31 December
2015: 5.97%). The increased average rate reflected US$204 million amortisation of the Group's US$420
million pre-export banking facility over the last year which has a margin of 225 bps over LIBOR and US$30
million of other facilities with an average cost of 3%.
As of 30 June 2016 gross debt was US$797 million, a 29% decrease or a US$326 million reduction compared
to gross debt at 30 June 2015 of US$1.1 billion (31 December 2015: US$904 million).
Tax
The income tax expense for the first half of 2016 was US$14 million (1H 2015: US$27 million) based on a
forecasted effective tax rate of 12% to 13% for the full year which is in line with the effective tax rate before
special items for 2015 of 13.5%.
Over the past several years the Group has built a large prepaid corporate profit tax balance as a result of the
local practice of linking VAT refunds to corporate profit tax payments. During the period CPT paid in advance
reduced to US$53 million as a result of exchange rate differences. Following the period end, Ferrexpo
recovered UAH100 million in cash (approximately US$4 million). Further details on prepaid corporate profit
tax are disclosed in Note 11 of the accounts.
Cash Flows
Working Capital
Cash generated from operating activities increased 32% to US$174 million in the first half of 2016 compared
to US$131 million in the first half of 2015. This strong performance reflected a US$16 million working capital
inflow during the period due to the sale of 244 thousand tonnes of pellets held on stock at the end of 2015, a
reduction in trade receivables and the recovery of overdue VAT. The Group secured new trade finance
arrangements in the first half of the year, of which US$9 million was in place at the end of June 2016.
Capital Investment
Total capital expenditure in the first half of 2016 was US$24 million, in-line with the first half of 2015 at US$25
million. During the period, the Group paid US$7 million for medium and fine crushing lines to Metso France.
Financial Management
Net debt declined by US$115 million to US$753 million as of 30 June 2016 compared to US$868 million as of
31 December 2015.
Net debt to EBITDA for the last 12 months was 2.5x compared to 2.8x as of 31 December 2015. As of 30 June
2016, Ferrexpo's cash and cash equivalents balance had increased by US$9 million to US$44 million
compared to US$35 million at the end of December 2015.
In the first six months of the year, the Group repaid US$105 million of debt under the US$420 million pre-
export finance facility in addition to US$15 million of debt under Export Credit Agency funding lines.
The Group's debt amortisation schedule in the second half of 2016 is lower than the first half with repayments
of US$76 million falling due compared to US$120 million in the first six months of the year.
In July 2016, the Group paid the final amortisation, US$17.5 million, of its US$420 million pre-export finance
facility that had been amortising over the past 24 months.
Ferrexpo will continue to assess new financing options while repaying its debt obligations as they fall due.
As a result of the forecast cash flows of the business, the large reserve base and Ferrexpo's competitive
positioning on the global iron ore and pellet cost curves, the accounts have been drawn up on a going
concern basis, however attention is drawn to the Going Concern section of the financial statements, Note 2,
and the risks facing the business.
Market Environment
Compared to the first half of 2015, global hot metal output, reflective of steel demand, fell 4% to 630 million
tonnes compared to 656 million tonnes in the first half of 2015 while total supply of iron ore exports increased
4% from 721 million tonnes in the first half of 2015 to 753 million tonnes in the first half of 20162. This
demand/supply dynamic impacted the iron ore price compared to the first half of 2015 and the PLATTS CFR
China iron ore fines price averaged US$52 per tonne compared to an average of US$61 per tonne in the first
half of 2015.
Compared to the second half of 2015, global hot metal production fell 2% to 630 million tonnes versus 644
million tonnes in the second half of 2015 while total exports of iron ore fell 1.3% in the first half of 2016 to 753
million tonnes compared to 763 million tonnes in the second half of 20152. The PLATTS CFR China iron ore
fines price in the first half of 2016 was in line with the second half of 2015 at US$51 per tonne. Nevertheless,
pricing remained volatile in 2015 and to date in 2016 trading within a wide range reaching a high of US$71
per tonne and a low of US$38 per tonne.
Global  supply of pellet exports declined 19% to 59 million tonnes in the first half of 2016 from 72 million
tonnes in the first half of 2015, according to CRU2, principally reflecting a 15 million tonne or 44% reduction in
supply from Brazil3. Compared to the second half of 2015 the supply of exported pellets fell 5%, again due to
reduced supply from Brazil following the Samarco tailings dam accident in November 2015.
2 CRU July 2016 Market Outlook.
3 Reflecting the production stoppage at Samarco following a tailings dam failure in November 2015. Prior to the failure, Samarco
produced approximately 30 million tonnes of pellets per annum or approximately 20% of global pellet exports.
The pellet premium that the Group received in the first half of 2016 improved throughout the period recovering
from lows seen at the start of the year to finish the period more strongly. In China the spot pellet premium fell to
a low of US$11 per tonne in January 2016 before recovering to US$22 per tonne in June 2016 (1H 2016
average: US$17 per tonne, 1H 2015 average: US$28 per tonne).  While the headline long term contract pellet
premium in the key markets of Western Europe and North East Asia was slightly lower than the same period
last year.
CRU expects pellet utilisation rates to increase to 88% in 2016 from 70% in 2015 based on a recovery in steel
mill profitability from the lows seen in recent years. Together with an expected deficit in pellet supply due to
the outage of Samarco, demand and pricing for pellets is expected to be well supported for the remainder of
2016.
Operational Review
Marketing
In the first half of 2016, Ferrexpo increased sales volumes by 6% to 6.0 million tonnes of iron ore pellets
compared to 5.7 million tonnes in the first half of 2015. The table below shows the breakdown of sales by key
market regions. Sales to Western Europe increased to 17% in the first half of 2016 compared to 9% in the first
half of 2015 while sales to North East Asia increased to 13% (1H 2015:8%). This significant increase in sales
to the premium steel markets follows the completion of the Group's quality upgrade project in 2015.
Of total sales volumes, 93% represented Ferrexpo Premium Pellets of 65% Fe, while 6% represented
Ferrexpo Basic Pellets of 62% Fe and 1% represented Ferrexpo Pellet Feed sold together with Ferrexpo's
premium pellets as part of a customer development programme.

Ferrexpo's realised price for its 65% Fe iron ore pellets is calculated by taking the average PLATTS CFR
China iron ore fines index for an agreed time period, adjusting for quality and adding a pellet premium. For
sales to the Far East, delivery is made on CFR terms with the resulting FOB netback determined by the actual
cost of freight. For sales to European and regional markets, delivery is generally made on FOB/DAP terms
which is determined by deducting a transparent freight market index such as C3.

The above table represents average numbers for a six monthly period and does not show actual price
movements during a period which impacts customer pricing.
The C3 freight index, as published by the Baltic Exchange, represents the industry benchmark price to
transport goods by sea from Tubarao, Brazil to Qingdao, China. The C3 index declined 34% during the period
compared to 1H 2015 following the substantial fall in the oil price. On average C3 freight reduced to US$7.1
per tonne in 1H 2016 (1H 2015: US$10.8 per tonne) resulting in a higher net back price for the Group.
Overall, taking account of the PLATTS fines index in the first half of 2016 compared to the second half of 2015
(as can be seen from the table above), achieved pellet premiums, and freight costs, the Group's realised price
in the first half of 2016 remained in line with the second half of 2015.
Production
Health and Safety
Most regrettably there was a contractor fatality at FPM during the period when a light vehicle traveling on a
FPM mine road overturned whilst completing security operations. Following the accident, Ferrexpo has further
strengthened its focus on safe behaviour when driving vehicles. The prevention of all incidents and injuries to
employees is the highest priority of the Board and management, who follow the principle that all accidents are
avoidable.
Overall, the Group's LTIFR in the first half of 2016 was 0.89 per million man hours worked compared to 0.61
per million man hours worked in the first half of 2015. The number of accidents at FPM reduced to four in the
first half of 2016 compared to 5 in the first half of 2015 while FYM LTIFR reported one accident during the
period compared to zero in the first half of 2015. At the barging operations, the number of accidents rose to
three in the first half of 2016 compared to one in the first half of 2015.
Both the mining and barging operations improved their LTIFR compared to the second half of 2015 as can be
seen from the table below.  The difference in LTIFR between the mining and barging operations principally
reflects the lower hours worked at the barging operations compared to the mining operations.

Pellet Production
Pellet production from own ore increased 3.6% compared to 5.7 million tonnes (1H 2016: 5.5 million tonnes).
This included a 12.3% increase in production of the Group's premium 65% Fe pellets to a record 5.4 million
tonnes (1H 2015: 4.8 million tonnes). Overall total production for the first half of 2016, was 5.7 million tonnes
compared to 5.8 million tonnes in first half of 2015 due to a significant reduction in output of pellets from third
party concentrate. Approximately 94% of total production volumes were Ferrexpo Premium Pellets of 65% Fe
compared to 87% in the first half of 2015.
The table below summarises production in the first half of 2016 compared to the first half of 2015.

Note: Production in April 2016 included 39kt of concentrate that was sold as Pellet Feed to a customer in
South East Asia.
Production Costs
The Group's average C1 cash cost reduced by 23% to US$25.7 per tonne in 1H 2016 compared to US$33.4
per tonne in 1H 2015 and by 19% when compared to US$31.9 per tonne for FY 2015. The decline was driven
by fixed cost benefits from increased production of own ore and more efficient operating practices, lower oil
and gas prices and the depreciation of the Hryvnia against the US dollar. For further information see Costs
and Currency.
The Group has several projects underway which are contributing to cost savings and efficiency improvements.
These include improved drilling and blasting techniques which yield better ore fragmentation and improved
excavator dig rates as well as a project to increase concentrate yield by optimising the amount of reagent
used and the blend ratios of ore.
The Group has continued to make good progress in reducing its gas consumption through co-firing with bio
fuel. Since the project commenced in September 2015 approximately US$950,000 has been saved through
the reduced consumption of natural gas which has declined by approximately 21 million cubic metres
(representing circa 20% of total natural gas consumption on an annualised basis).  The Group aims to replace
up to 30% of its total natural gas consumption in the pelletiser by this method.
Ferrexpo is a low cost and efficient pellet producer and is competitively placed on the global benchmark cost
curve for 62% Fe iron ore fines after adjusting for the premium it receives relative to the index fines price. This
allows the Group to remain profitable even in the current low iron ore price environment.
Capital Investment
Ferrexpo's brownfield operations lend themselves to incremental additions of pellet supply subject to market
conditions and funding availability.  A programme to increase pellet production has been defined internally
which would involve incremental investment in the existing beneficiation, pelletising and mining facilities.
These projects are highly NPV accretive.
Ukraine
Economic activity in Ukraine is showing signs of recovery as indicated by an increase in industrial production
of 2%4 in the first half of 2016 compared with the first half of 2015 and a 9%4 increase in construction activity
compared to the first half of 2015, albeit these increases are off a low base following a recession over the past
two years.
4 Source: State Statistics Service of Ukraine
The Group is pleased to report that the Government continues to reform the process of VAT recovery which
has increased in transparency and predictability.
To date Ukraine has received US$6.7 billion of a US$17.5 billion IMF loan package which was approved in
March 2015.
The Government has been in negotiations to receive a third tranche of the package which is expected to be
received in the second half of the year.
Sovereign risk as measured by the yields on outstanding Ukrainian government bonds have reduced
significantly since the start of 2016, for example, the outstanding Ukrainian 2019 bond is currently trading
above par while the yield to maturity has fallen from a high of 11.4% in June 2016 to around 7.7% as of 1
August 2016, indicating a lower country risk environment. For further information see Update on Risks:
Political and Legal risks pertaining to Ukraine.
Board
At the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 19 May 2016, five of the Independent Directors (Oliver
Baring, Wolfram Kuoni, Ihor Mitiukov, Bert Nacken and Mary Reilly) did not receive the requisite votes
required for re-appointment by independent shareholders. As stated in the Company's AGM Notice dated 12
April 2016 and under Listing Rule 9.2.2.F, the Company will put the matter to a second vote of all
shareholders, to be held between 90 and 120 days after the Annual General Meeting. Pending the second
vote, the relevant Directors are deemed to have been re-elected to the Board. Wolfram Kuoni and Ihor
Mitiukov, having completed 9 years on the Board on 1 June 2016, are now no longer deemed to be
independent, in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. Ihor Mitiukov will stand for re-election
at the EGM on the basis that he will step down when a suitable Ukrainian successor to him has been found.
Wolfram Kuoni will stand for re-election at the EGM but is likely to step down from the Board later in the year.
A successor to Oliver Baring as Senior Independent Director is being sought with a view to replacing him
once he ceases to be independent in December 2016.
Having consulted a number of the larger shareholders of the Company, the Board intends to hold a second
vote for the re-election of all five of the above Directors, and notice of a General Meeting for this purpose will
be sent to shareholders shortly.
Update on Risks
Since the publication of the 2015 annual results in March 2016, the Group assesses that the risks facing the
business, as highlighted on pages 30 to 39 of the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts, remain relevant.  An
update is provided below on material developments of key risks during the first half of 2016.
·     Debt maturity profile
As at the end of July 2016, Ferrexpo has fully repaid a US$420 million pre export finance facility that had been
amortising over the past 24 months. The Group has a semi-annual US$18 million bond coupon payment due
on 6 October 2016 and it will begin quarterly repayments of approximately US$44 million of its US$350
million pre export finance facility in November 2016. Should the iron ore price reduce from current levels there
is a risk that the Group may not be able to service these payments. As a result of lower gearing resulting from
net operating cash flow generation and good performance in the first half of the year together with a lower
amortisation profile in the second half of the year the Group considers this risk to have diminished but still
remains.
For further information see Going Concern Basis - Note 2 of the financial accounts.
·     Interest rate risk
The Group has a mix of debt facilities at fixed and floating interest rates. An increase in US$ LIBOR could
result in higher costs for the Group.  As of 30 June 2016 the proportion of debt with floating interest reduced to
50% of outstanding debt (30 June 2015: 55% of outstanding debt; 31 December 2015: 56% of outstanding
debt) principally due to the monthly amortisation of a US$420 million pre-export finance facility which
completed in July 2016. Any new debt facilities could result in an increase in interest costs. The Group's
average cost of debt for the period ended 30 June 2016 was 6.6% (30 June 2015: 5.32%; 31 December 2015:
5.97%).
·     Global macroeconomic growth
The demand for steel, and hence iron ore, is driven by global economic growth trends, which in the recent
past has been largely determined by Chinese economic growth as China has produced more than 45% of the
world's steel output for the past 7 years. China has reported real GDP growth of 6.7% for the first half of 2016
compared to 7% in the first half of 2015 following a Government stimulus package in the first quarter of 2016.
A reduction in world or Chinese GDP growth could impact demand for steel and iron ore.
·     Iron ore price and pellet premiums
Fluctuations in the iron ore price have negatively impacted the financial results of the Group in the first half of
2016 compared to the comparative period in 2015. In the first six months of 2016 the PLATTS CFR China iron
ore fines price averaged US$52 per tonne compared to an average of US$61 per tonne in 1H 2015. The price
was volatile, however, and traded within a wide range from an eight year low of US$38 per tonne in mid-
December 2015 to a 15 month high of US$71 per tonne in April 2016 before settling at around US$50 per
tonne broadly in line with the average of the second half of 2015. Should the iron ore price decline further in
the second half of the year there is a risk it could negatively impact the Group's profitability and cash
generation ability.
Ferrexpo receives a pellet premium in addition to the iron ore fines price. Currently, a substantial portion of the
Group's profit is due to this premium. The pellet premium improved throughout the first half of 2016 recovering
from lows seen at the start of the year.  In China the spot pellet premium traded at US$11 per tonne in January
2016 before recovering to US$22 per tonne in June 2016 (1H 2016 average: US$17 per tonne, 1H 2015
average: US$28 per tonne).  While the headline long term contract pellet premium in the key markets of
Western Europe and North East Asia was set at US$31 per tonne to US$32 per tonne in the first half of 2016
compared to US$32 per tonne to US$33 per tonne in the first half of 2015. The pellet premium currently
represents a high proportion of the underlying iron ore fines price and there is a risk that premiums could
reduce negatively impacting the Group's profitability and cash generation ability. For further information see
Introduction and Market Environment.
·     C3 freight
Ferrexpo is exposed to international freight rates as all of its long term contracts are priced with reference to
transparent indices such as the Baltic Exchange C3 freight price (capesize route from Tubarao, Brazil to
Qingdao, China).  Fronthaul capesize voyage rates are currently trading at just above historic low levels, with
the reductions driven by low oil prices and overcapacity. The C3 index declined 39% to US$7 per tonne in 1H
2016 to US$7 per tonne compared to US$11 per tonne in 1H 2015. An increase in freight rates would directly
reduce the Group's received net back price.
·     Political and legal risks pertaining to Ukraine
The economic recovery in Ukraine remains fragile and Ferrexpo remains exposed to the Government's ability
to meet its payment obligations to Ferrexpo on amounts due, such as VAT refunds. Furthermore the economic
recession of the past two years has impacted the Government's ability to fund usual social services and this
could lead to social upheaval and political tension within local communities. Any escalation of the rebels
conflict in Eastern Ukraine could have a further adverse effect on the economy and impact the ability of local
companies and financial institutions to obtain funding from the international capital markets, including
Ferrexpo's ability to obtain financing.
Other risks include a weak judicial system that is susceptible to outside influence, and can take an extended
period of time for the courts to reach final judgment. For further information see Ukraine above and Note 20 of
the financial accounts.
·     Ukrainian banking sector
The Ukrainian banking sector continues to go through a period of industry rationalisation. Year to date in
2016, the National Bank of Ukraine has placed 15 banks into temporary administration and the number of
operating banks in Ukraine has reduced from 180 at the start of 2014 to 102 as of 30 June 2016. The sector is
still considered to be under capitalised and there remains a risk that funds held by Ferrexpo in the Ukrainian
banking system could be lost.
For further information see Note 16 and Note 20 of the financial accounts.
·    Ukrainian currency
The Group receives all of its income from pellet sales in US dollars while more than half of its total cost base
is denominated in Ukrainian Hryvnia. Following a period of sharp devaluation against the US dollar in 2014
and 2015 the Hryvnia has been relatively stable. The average Hryvnia per US dollar in 1H 2016 was 25.5
compared to an average rate of UAH21.4 per US dollar in 1H 2015 (average FY 2015: UAH21.9 per US
dollar). Since 30 June 2016, the Hryvnia has appreciated slightly against the US dollar to 24.8.
Should the Hryvnia appreciate further against the US dollar it could increase local costs in US dollar terms
reducing Group profitability.
·     Ukrainian inflation
In 2015 consumer price inflation reached a high of 49% following the substantial devaluation of the Hryvnia
against the US Dollar in 2014 and 2015 when the Hryvnia depreciated from UAH8 per US Dollar as of 1
January 2014 to UAH24 per US Dollar as of 31 December 2015. As of 30 June 2016, year on year inflation
had reduced to 6.9%. The areas of inflation that the Group is most exposed to are wages, electricity and rail
tariffs. The Group looks to partly offset cost inflation through increases in mining and production efficiencies.
There is a risk that the Group is unable to offset inflation through production efficiencies and that the Group's
cost base could increase as a result.  For further information see Costs and Ukrainian currency above.
·     Ukrainian VAT
During 1H 2016, the Group received VAT refunds in full, including outstanding VAT balances from previous
years. As such the current balance of VAT outstanding is a significant improvement over recent years. The
process of recovering VAT in Ukraine has become more transparent for all industry participants. The risk
remains, however, that there could be delays in recovering outstanding VAT should the Government's
finances deteriorate.
·     Ukrainian Taxes
In 2014 and 2015, VAT receivable balances in Ukraine were mainly recovered in exchange for prepayments
of corporate profit tax (CPT). To date in 2016, the prepayment of CPT is no longer a requirement and the
Group recovered a small portion of prepaid CPT in July 2016. Ferrexpo is hopeful that the Government will
take further steps in the second half of 2016 in resolving the issue of prepaid CPT. There is a risk, however,
that the Government's financial position could deteriorate and that the previous practice of prepaying CPT
could resume which would absorb significant amounts of working capital. For further information see Note 11
of the financial accounts.

Independent Review Report to Ferrexpo PLC
Introduction
We have been engaged by the Company to review the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly
financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2016 which comprises the Interim Consolidated Income
Statement, Interim Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, Interim Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position, Interim Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, Interim Consolidated Statement of
Changes in Equity and related notes 1 to 22. We have read the other information contained in the half yearly
financial report and considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies
with the information in the condensed set of financial statements.
This report is made solely to the Company in accordance with guidance contained in International Standard
on Review Engagements 2410 (UK and Ireland) "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the
Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued by the Auditing Practices Board. To the fullest extent permitted by
law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company, for our work, for this report,
or for the conclusions we have formed.
Directors' Responsibilities
The half-yearly financial report is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the Directors. The Directors
are responsible for preparing the half-yearly financial report in accordance with the Disclosure and
Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority.
As disclosed in note 2, the annual financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with IFRSs
as adopted by the European Union. The condensed set of financial statements included in this half-yearly
financial report has been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, "Interim
Financial Reporting", as adopted by the European Union.
Our Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the condensed set of financial statements in
the half-yearly financial report based on our review.
Scope of Review
We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and
Ireland) 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity"
issued by the Auditing Practices Board for use in the United Kingdom. A review of interim financial information
consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and
applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit
conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) and consequently does
not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be
identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed set of
financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2016 is not prepared,
in all material respects, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 as adopted by the European
Union and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority.
Emphasis of matter - Going concern
In forming our opinion, which is not qualified in this respect, we have also considered the adequacy of the
disclosures made in note 2 to the financial statements concerning the Company's ability to continue as a
going concern. The conditions described in note 2 indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may
cast significant doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  The financial statements
do not include the adjustments that would result if the Company was unable to continue as a going concern.

Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1: Corporate information
Organisation and operation
Ferrexpo plc (the "Company") is incorporated in the United Kingdom, which is considered to be the country of
domicile, with its registered office at 55 St James's Street, London, SW1A 1LA, UK. Ferrexpo plc and its
subsidiaries (the "Group") operate two mines and a processing plant near Kremenchug in Ukraine, an interest
in a port in Odessa and sales and marketing activities around the world including offices in Switzerland,
Dubai, Japan, China, Singapore and Ukraine. The Group also owns logistics assets in Austria which operates
a fleet of vessels operating on the Rhine and Danube waterways and an ocean going vessel which provides
top off services and operates on international sea routes. The Group's operations are vertically integrated from
iron ore mining through to iron ore concentrate and pellet production and subsequent logistics. The Group's
mineral properties lie within the Kremenchug Magnetic Anomaly and are currently being extracted at the
Gorishne-Plavninskoye and Lavrikovskoye ("GPL") and Yeristovskoye deposits.
The majority shareholder of the Group is Fevamotinico S.a.r.l. ("Fevamotinico"), a company incorporated in
Luxembourg and ultimately owned by The Minco Trust, of which Kostyantin Zhevago, the Group's Chief
Executive Officer, is a beneficiary. At the time this report was published, Fevamotinico held 50.3% (30 June
2015: 50.3%; 31 December 2015: 50.3%) of Ferrexpo plc's issued share capital.
The Group's interests in its subsidiaries are held indirectly by the Company, with the exception of Ferrexpo
AG, which is directly held. The Group's consolidated subsidiaries are disclosed in Note 37 of the Annual
Report and Accounts 2015.
At 30 June 2016, the Group also holds through OJSC Ferrexpo Poltava Mining an interest of 48.6% (30 June
2015: 48.6%; 31 December 2015: 48.6%) in TIS Ruda, a Ukrainian port located on the Black Sea. As this is
an associate, it is accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Note 2: Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months period ended 30 June 2016 have
been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard ('IAS') 34 Interim Financial Reporting.
The interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and disclosures
required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the Group's annual
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not constitute statutory accounts as defined in
section 435 of the Companies Act 2006. The financial information for the full year is based on the statutory
accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2015. A copy of the statutory accounts for that year, which
were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS') issued by the
International Accounting Standard Board ('IASB'), as adopted by the European Union as they apply to
financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2015, have been delivered to the Register
of Companies. The auditors' report under section 495 of the Companies Act 2006 in relation to those accounts
was (i) unqualified, (ii) included a reference to a matter to which the auditors drew attention by way of
emphasis without qualifying their report, and (iii) did not contain a statement under 498(2) or 498(3) of the
Companies Act 2006.
Going Concern Basis
Over the next year from the approval of the financial statements, US$158,150 thousand of debt amortisation
falls due for repayment. Iron ore pricing levels have been volatile and could reduce to levels where, without
associated cost relief, the Group's net cash flow generation would only be able to meet these payments over a
longer period triggering cross default across part or all of its debt facilities.
The Group expects to be able to repay its facilities and meet its liabilities as they fall due based on current
forecasts and also expects, that if necessary, it would be able to agree amendments to relevant facilities to
make repayments over a longer period or obtain additional financing. As a result the financial statements have
been drawn up on a going concern basis.
The impact of the uncertainty of the future level of the iron ore price and operating cost inputs are material
uncertainties and may cast significant doubt upon the Group's ability to meet its debt amortisation obligations
as they fall due and to continue as a going concern. Under these circumstances it would be necessary to
restate amounts in the balance sheet, which will materially change the amounts and classification of figures
contained in the financial statements.
Accounting policies adopted
The accounting policies and methods of computation adopted in the preparation of the interim condensed
consolidated financial statements are the same as those followed in the preparation of the Group's annual
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The following new standards and interpretations have been applied from 1 January 2016, with no effect on
reported results, financial position or disclosure in the interim financial statements:
Amendments to IFRS 11: Joint arrangements: Accounting for acquisitions of interests
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation
Annual Improvements to IFRSs - 2012-2014 Cycle
Seasonality
The Group's operations are not affected by seasonality.
Note 3: Segment information
The Group is managed as a single entity, which produces, develops and markets its principal product, iron ore
pellets, for sale to the metallurgical industry. While the revenue generated by the Group is monitored at a more
detailed level, there are no separate measures of profit reported to the Group's Chief Operating Decision-
Maker ('CODM'). In accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments, the Group presents its results in a single
segment, which are disclosed in the income statement for the Group. The management monitors the operating
result of the Group based on a number of measures including EBITDA, C1 costs and the net financial
indebtedness.
EBITDA
The Group presents EBITDA because it believes that EBITDA is a useful measure for evaluating its ability to
generate cash and its operating performance. The Group's full definition of EBITDA is disclosed in the
Glossary.

The Group's C1 costs represent the cash costs of production of iron ore pellets from own ore divided by
production volume of pellets produces from own ore, and excludes non-cash costs such as depreciation,
pension costs and inventory movements as well as costs of purchased ore and concentrate and production
cost of gravel.

The Group's net financial indebtedness increased in the second half of the financial year 2015 by the
insolvency of the Group's transactional bank in Ukraine resulting in a reduction of the balance of cash and
cash equivalents available in Ukraine (see Note 16 and Note 20).
The Group's balance of cash and cash equivalents increased by US$9,110 thousand after debt repayments of
US$119,775 thousand during the period ended 30 June 2016 (30 June 2015: US$179,944 thousand, 31
December US$393,876 thousand).

Operating foreign exchange gains and losses are those items that are directly related to the production and
sale of pellets (e.g. trade receivables, trade payables on operating expenditure). Non-operating gains and
losses are those associated with the Group's financing and treasury activities and with local income tax
payables.
During the period ended 30 June 2016, the devaluation of the Ukrainian Hryvnia compared to the US Dollar
was significantly less than in the comparative periods presented above. The local currency in Ukraine has
devalued by approximately 4% compared to the US Dollar; from 24.001 as at 31 December 2015 to 24.854 as
at the end of this reporting period compared to 33% and 52% during the comparative periods ended 30 June
2015 and 31 December 2015.

Fees for liability management activities of the Group for the amount of US$5,230 thousand (30 June 2015: nil,
31 December 2015: nil) are included in other finance costs.
Note 11: Taxation
The Group pays corporate profit tax in a number of jurisdictions and its tax rate is influenced by the mix of
profits primarily between Ukraine, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Dubai, as well as the level of non-
deductible expenses for tax purposes in each of these jurisdictions. For the period ended 30 June 2016, the
income tax expense was based on an expected weighted average tax rate of 12.2% for the financial year
2016, adjusted for some one-off items for the period, compared to an effective tax rate before special items of
13.5% for the financial year 2015.
The income tax credit of US$6,108 thousand shown as of the end of the financial year 2015 was a result of a
deferred tax credit of US$28,420 thousand recognised as a deferred tax asset in respect of the allowance for
the restricted cash and deposits for which the Group expects that it will become tax deductible in a future
period (see Note 20 for further details).
During the financial years 2014 and 2015, current VAT receivable balances in Ukraine were mainly recovered
in exchange for prepayments of corporate profit tax. As at 30 June 2016, the balance of these prepayments
made in previous periods amounted to US$52,616 thousand (30 June 2015: US$53,902 thousand; 31
December 2015: US$54,482 thousand) and it is management's view that this balance will be offset with future
profits or will be refunded in cash.
The Group received a refund of prepaid corporate profit tax in Ukraine in the amount of US$4,029 thousand in
July 2016 and expects further refunds in the following months. The amount already refunded or expected to be
recovered later in 2016 of US$16,826 thousand was classified as current whereas the remaining balance of
US$36,522 thousand is still shown as non-current due to the uncertainty as to the timing of the recovery of this
balance.

Note 12: Earnings per share and dividends paid and proposed
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the net profit for the period attributable to ordinary equity shareholders of
Ferrexpo plc by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares.
Diluted earnings per share are calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in
issue on the assumption of conversion of all potentially dilutive Ordinary Shares. All share awards are
potentially dilutive and have been considered in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.

Note 13: Property, plant and equipment
During the six months period ended 30 June 2016, the Group acquired property, plant and equipment with a
cost of US$15,811 thousand (30 June 2015: US$36,223 thousand; 31 December 2015: US$93,467 thousand)
and disposed of property, plant and equipment with original costs of US$4,748 thousand (30 June 2015:
US$8,944 thousand; 31 December 2015: US$17,563 thousand). The total depreciation charge for the period
was US$29,825 thousand (30 June 2015: US$29,693 thousand; 31 December 2015: US$66,758 thousand).
During the reporting period, the Ukrainian Hryvnia has further devalued compared to the US Dollar from
24.001 as of 31 December 2015 to 24.854 as of 30 June 2015 reducing property, plant and equipment by
US$19,368 thousand (30 June 2015: US$207,209 thousand; 31 December 2015: US$286,742 thousand).
This effect is reflected in the translation reserve included in shareholder's equity. See also Note 17.
The carrying value of property, plant and equipment includes capitalised borrowing costs on qualifying assets
of US$14,332 thousand (30 June 2015: US$11,996 thousand; 31 December 2015: US$13,021 thousand).

During the period ended 30 June 2016, the devaluation of the Ukrainian Hryvnia compared to the US Dollar
was significantly less than in the comparative periods presented above. The local currency in Ukraine has
devalued by approximately 4% compared to the US Dollar; from 24.001 as at 31 December 2015 to 24.854 as
at the end of this reporting period, compared to 33% and 52% during the comparative periods ended 30 June
2015 and 31 December 2015. As a result of the significant devaluation of the Ukrainian Hryvnia during the
comparative period ended 31 December 2015, the balance of the outstanding VAT balances expressed in US
Dollar decreased by US$25,613 thousand, compared to US$833 thousand in the period ended 30 June 2016.
This effect is reflected in the translation reserve. See also Note 17.
As at 30 June 2016, management expect that overdue balances totalling US$8,594 thousand (30 June 2015:
US$26,101 thousand; 31 December 2015: US$30,613 thousand) to be recovered within one year. The total
VAT receivable balance shown in the table above is net of an allowance of US$1,001 thousand (30 June
2015: US$1,710 thousand; 31 December 2015: US$1,059 thousand) to reflect the uncertainties in terms of the
recovery of VAT receivable balances related to one of the Ukrainian subsidiaries with its mine still being
developed.
Note 15: Inventories
Inventories are held at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
As at 30 June 2016 ore stockpiles amounting to US$117,773 thousand (30 June 2015: US$80,369 thousand;
31 December 2015: US$98,802 thousand) were classified as non-current as this ore is not planned to be
processed within one year.

The available cash and cash equivalents balance reduced during the second half of the financial year 2015
following the insolvency of the Group's transactional bank in Ukraine (see Note 20 for further information) and
debt repayments amounting to US$393,876 thousand during the financial year 2015. The debt repayments
during the period ended 30 June 2016 totalled US$119,775 thousand (30 June 2015: US$179,944 thousand).
Further information on the Group's gross debt is provided in Note 18.
The balance of cash and cash equivalents held in Ukraine amounts to US$12,447 thousand as at 30 June
2016 (30 June 2015: US$167,030 thousand; 31 December 2015: US$13,896 thousand).
The Group's exposure to liquidity, counterparty and interest rate risk as well as a sensitivity analysis for
financial assets and liabilities are disclosed in Note 31 of the Annual Report and Accounts 2015.
Note 17: Share capital and reserves
The share capital of Ferrexpo plc at 30 June 2016 was 613,967,956 (30 June 2015: 613,967,956; 31
December 2015: 613,967,956) Ordinary Shares at par value of £0.10 paid for cash, resulting in share capital
of US$121,628 thousand, which is unchanged since the Group's Initial Public Offering in June 2007. This
balance includes 25,343,814 shares (30 June 2015: 25,343,814 shares; 31 December 2015: 25,343,814
shares), which are held in treasury, resulting from a share buyback that was undertaken in September 2008,
and 3,162,399 shares held in the employee benefit trust reserve (30 June 2015:3,192,399 shares; 31
December 2015: 3,162,399 shares).
The translation reserve includes the effect from the exchange differences arising on translation of non-US
Dollar functional currency operations (mainly in Ukrainian Hryvnia). During the period ended 30 June 2016,
the devaluation of the Ukrainian Hryvnia compared to the US Dollar was significantly less than in the
comparative periods ended 30 June 2015 and 31 December 2015. The local currency in Ukraine has
devalued from 24.001 as at 31 December 2015 to 24.854 as at the end of this reporting period compared to
the US Dollar (approximately 4%); compared to 33% and 52% during the comparative periods ended 30 June
2015 and 31 December 2015. The exchange differences arising on translation of the Group's foreign
operations are initially recognised in the other comprehensive income. See also the Interim Consolidated
Statement of Comprehensive Income of these financial statements for further details.
As at 30 June 2016 other reserves attributable to equity shareholders of Ferrexpo plc comprised.

As at 30 June 2016 the Group has a revolving syndicated US$350 million pre-export finance facility, which is
fully drawn, and a remaining drawn balance of US$17,500 thousand of a syndicated US$420 million pre-
export finance facility. The amortisation of the US$350 million facility commences in November 2016 with
eight quarterly instalments to the final maturity date of 8 August 2018. The US$420 million facility was fully
repaid by 31 July 2016 and cancelled.
As at 30 June 2016 the major bank debt facilities were guaranteed and secured as follows:
·      Ferrexpo AG and Ferrexpo Middle East FZE assigned the rights to revenue from certain sales contracts;
·      OJSC Ferrexpo Poltava Mining assigned all of its rights of certain export contracts for the pellets sales to
Ferrexpo AG and Ferrexpo Middle East FZE; and
·      the Group pledged bank accounts of Ferrexpo AG and Ferrexpo Middle East FZE into which all proceeds
from the sale of certain iron ore pellet contracts are received.
In addition to the Group's major bank debt facilities listed above, an unsecured US$500 million Eurobond was
issued on 7 April 2011, which the Group exchanged and cancelled through the issuance of new notes at par
value totalling US$346,385 thousand and the repayment of US$153,615 thousand in cash. The exchange
was completed in two transactions on 24 February 2015 and 6 July 2015. As a result of the two exchanges
completed, the tenor of the notes outstanding was extended from April 2016 to April 2019 with two equal
instalments of US$173,193 thousand falling due on 7 April 2018 and 2019, respectively. The new notes have
a 10.375% interest coupon payable semi-annually, compared to 7.875% for the initially issued notes in April
2011.
As at 30 June 2016, the Group has open trade finance facilities in the amount of US$9,306 thousand (30 June
2015: nil, 31 December 2015: nil), which are secured against receivables related to these specific trades.
Further information on the Group's exposure to interest rate, foreign currency and liquidity risk is provided in
Note 31 of the Annual Report and Accounts 2015.
Note 19: Related party disclosure
During the periods presented the Group entered into arm's length transactions with entities under the common
control of the majority owner of the Group, Kostyantin Zhevago and with associated companies and with other
related parties. Management considers that the Group has appropriate procedures in place to identify and
properly disclose transactions with the related parties.

refer to TIS Ruda LLC, in which the Group holds an interest of 48.6%. This is the only associated company of
the Group. Other related parties are principally those entities controlled by Anatoly Trefilov who is a member
of the supervisory board of OJSC Ferrexpo Poltava Mining. Related party transactions entered into by the

Entities under common control
Current year
k   During the period ended 30 June 2016, the Group entered in various transactions of a capital nature with
related parties totalling US$27 thousand. These transactions were in the ordinary course of business.
Prior periods:
k   During the financial year 2015, the Group entered into various transactions of a capital nature with related
parties totalling to US$1,257 thousand, which were in the ordinary course of business:
·      The Group procured a filter in the amount of US$958 thousand from OJSC Berdichev Machine-Building
Plant Progress for the quality upgrade of the pelletising plant at Ferrexpo Poltava Mining; and

In April 2015 the Group received 27 rail cars totalling US$1,431 thousand (US$842 thousand at the
prevailing exchange rate at delivery) in addition to 25 rail cars received in 2015. A total of 300 rail cars were
ordered in February 2014 under the authority of a shareholder approval obtained on 24 May 2012. As a
consequence of the conflict in the Eastern part of Ukraine, the producer of the rail cars was not in the position
to produce and deliver all rail cars ordered and prepaid. The remaining balance of the prepayment was fully
written-off as of 31 December 2015, after having provided for it already as of 31 December 2014.

A description of the most material balances which are over US$200 thousand in the current or comparative
periods is given below.
Entities under common control
l      The balance of the investments available-for-sale comprised shareholdings in PJSC Stakhanov Railcar
Company (1.10%) and Vostok Ruda Ltd. (1.10%). The ultimate beneficial owner of these companies is
Kostyantin Zhevago. PJSC Stakhanov Railcar Company is further listed on the Ukrainian stock exchange.
The changes of the values in the table above are related to fair value adjustments recorded during the
respective reporting periods. The shareholdings for all investments remained unchanged during the periods
disclosed above. The balance of US$5 thousand as at 30 June 2016 related to the investment in PJSC
Stakhanov Railcar Company (30 June 2015: US$23 thousand; 31 December 2015: US$9 thousand).
m    As at the end of the comparative period ended 30 June 2015, other non-current assets related to a deposit
of US$3,109 thousand with Bank F&C, which was deposited for loans and mortgages granted by the bank to
employees of the Group under the Group's social loyalty programme. As at 31 December 2015, an allowance
for the full amount of US$3,105 thousand (at the exchange rate at the end of the period) with Bank F&C was
recorded subsequent to the insolvency of Bank F&C declared by the National Bank of Ukraine on 17
September 2015. Further information is provided in footnote (q) below and in Note 20.
n     As of 31 December 2015, trade and other receivables included outstanding amounts due from Kislorod
PCC of US$404 thousand (30 June 2015: US$343 thousand) for the sale of power, steam and water. No such
receivable balance as of 30 June 2016.
o     The balances as at the end of the comparative periods ended 30 June 2015 and 31 December 2015
include prepayments of US$659 thousand and US$577 thousand made to Vostok Ruda Ltd. for purchases of
concentrate. An allowance for the full amount prepaid was recorded during the period ended 30 June 2016 as
a result of the bankruptcy filed by the related party.
o     The balance as of the end of the comparative period ended 30 June 2015 included a prepayment in the
amount of US$1,748 thousand made to OJSC Ukrzakordongeologia for the procurement of gas. No such
prepayment was made as of 30 June 2016 and 31 December 2015.
p     As at the end of the comparative period ended 30 June 2015, cash and cash equivalents with Bank F&C
were US$164,681 thousand. On 17 September 2015, the National Bank of Ukraine announced that it had
adopted a decision to declare Bank F&C insolvent and the bank was put into temporary administration by the
Deposit Guarantee Fund. As a consequence, a full allowance was recorded in September 2015 for the
balance of cash and deposits held at Bank F&C at this point of time. See footnote (i) and Note 20 for further
information.
q     As at the end of the comparative period ended 30 June 2015, trade and other payables included US$494
thousand for compressed air and oxygen purchased from Kislorod PCC (31 December 2015: US$475
thousand). No such outstanding balance as of 30 June 2016.
Associated companies
n     Trade and other receivables included US$3,608 thousand (30 June 2015: nil; 31 December 2015:
US$2,273 thousand) for dividends receivable from TIS Ruda LLC.
q     Trade and other payables included US$1,469 thousand (30 June 2015: US$578 thousand; 31 December

Legal
In the ordinary course of business, the Group is subject to legal actions and complaints. Management believes
that the ultimate liability, if any, arising from such actions or complaints will not have a material adverse effect
on the financial condition or the results of future operations of the Group.
Deposit Guarantee Fund and Liquidator of Bank F&C
The Group's principal subsidiary, OJSC Ferrexpo Poltava Mining ('FPM'), received a credit of US$9,984
thousand (US$8,988 thousand at the exchange rate as at 30 June 2016) to its account with Bank F&C
following the introduction of the temporary administration on 18 September 2015. FPM filed a claim against
Bank F&C under the management of the Administrator, as appointed by the Deposit Guarantee Fund, on 30
October 2015 in the Kyiv City Commercial Court for the release of this amount in accordance with applicable
legislation. The hearing on 4 December 2015 ruled in favour of FPM. This court ruling was subsequently
appealed. During the hearing on 25 May 2016, the initial decision in favour of the Group was upheld by the
Kyiv Appellate Commercial Court and on 10 June 2016, the decision was further appealed by the Liquidator
of Bank F&C with a hearing date yet to be confirmed.
Based on the positive decisions from the Kyiv City Commercial Court and the Kyiv Appellate Commercial
Court, despite the recent further appeal, management of the Group expects to be successful in the upcoming
appeal and that this amount ultimately will be recovered in full as required under Ukrainian legislation. See
also Note 16 for further information.
The Group recorded a full allowance for the cash balance held in Bank F&C in September 2015 following its
insolvency and temporary administration (see also Note 16). As at 30 June 2016, the balance of restricted
cash and deposits with a full allowance amounts to US$162,632 thousand (31 December 2015: US$168,575
thousand with full allowance). The level of recoverability of balances that were held with Bank F&C at the
point of time of the insolvency declared by the NBU cannot be reasonably assessed at the current time due to
the complexity, uncertainties and the level of the ultimate recovery of the bank's loan portfolio net of costs
during liquidation.
Salvage of grounded vessel
The Group is currently involved in arbitration proceedings in respect of the costs incurred for the salvage of a
grounded vessel off the coast of Singapore carrying the Group's iron ore pellets to China. Although the
Group's customer was at risk in respect of the insurance cover for the pellets shipped, the Group received a
claim from the salvage operator as the Group still had the title to the goods during the vessel's period of
salvage. The arbitration hearing took place on 6 May 2016 in London and the final award from the Arbitrator is
expected to be received in August 2016. In case of a decision by the Arbitrator in favour of the opposing party,
the Group would still aim to claim the amount in the amount of approximately US$5,000 thousand from the
insurance company of the customer who was on risk for the vessel's period of salvage.
Share dispute
The Group was involved in a share dispute which commenced in 2005 and has been disclosed in its various
public documents since IPO in 2007. On 20 October 2014, the Kyiv City Commercial Court dismissed the
claim of the opposing party in full. This judgment was confirmed by the Kyiv Appeal Commercial Court and the
Higher Commercial Court of Ukraine on 28 January 2015 and 14 April 2015, respectively. No further court
proceedings have been initiated by the opposing party.
Tax and other regulatory compliance
Ukrainian legislation and regulations regarding taxation and customs continue to evolve. Legislation and
regulations are not always clearly written and are subject to varying interpretations and inconsistent
enforcement by local, regional and national authorities, and other governmental bodies. Instances of
inconsistent interpretations are not unusual. The uncertainty of application and the evolution of Ukrainian tax
laws, including those affecting cross-border transactions, create a risk of additional tax payments having to be
made by the Group, which could have a material effect on the Group's financial position and results of
operations. This also includes a transfer pricing law which significantly increased the power of the tax
authorities. The Group does not believe that these risks are any more significant than those of similar
enterprises in Ukraine.
As at 30 June 2016, there are no recoverable VAT balances in the process of being considered by the
Ukrainian court system (30 June 2015: US$2,491 thousand; 31 December 2015: US$1,147 thousand).

Interest bearing loans and borrowings
The fair values of interest-bearing loans and borrowings are based on the discounted cash flows using market
interest rates except for the fair value of the Eurobond issued, which is based on the market price quotation at
the reporting date.
Available-for-sale financial assets
As at 9 June 2015, the Group disposed its 15.5% available-for-sale equity investment in Ferrous Resources
Limited ("Ferrous") for a total cash consideration of US$41,767 thousand resulting in a gain in this amount
realised in the period ended 30 June 2015. This investment was acquired during the financial year 2013 with
total transaction costs of US$82,382 thousand and fully impaired as at 30 September 2014 due to
uncertainties in respect of the operational activity and the future development of the mining operation at this
point of time. In the period ended 30 June 2015, the investment was revalued to US$41,800 thousand based
on an irrevocable tender and support agreement signed on 29 April 2015 for the disposal of the stake in
Ferrous for a cash consideration of US$41,800 thousand, which was considered to be the fair value of the
investment at the end of this reporting period and the gain from this revaluation was recognised in the
statement of other comprehensive income. This gain was reclassified to profit or loss at the point of time of the
completion of the disposal.
The available-for-sale equity investment in PJSC Stakhanov Railcar Company in the amount of US$5
thousand (30 June 2015: US$23 thousand; 31 December 2015: US$9 thousand) is measured at its fair value
based on the quoted market price for its shares on the Ukrainian Stock exchange ('PFTS') and are
categorised as Level 1 financial instrument within the fair value hierarchy
As of 30 June 2016, the fair value of the available-for-sale financial assets in Level 1 decreased by US$18
thousand (30 June 2015: decrease of US$23 thousand; 31 December 2015: decrease of US$37 thousand).
Other financial assets and liabilities
The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and payables, restricted cash and
deposits, other financial assets and accrued liabilities are approximately equal to their carrying amounts due
to their short maturity.
There were no transfers between the different levels during the reporting period.
Reconciliation of recurring fair value measurements categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy is
