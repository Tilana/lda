<p>80. Supply chain assurance faces the greatest credibility challenges.  Global brands 
and retailers, among others, have developed supplier codes to compensate for weak or 
unenforced standards in some countries, because global social expectations require them 
to demonstrate adherence to minimum standards.  However, without independent external 
assurance of some sort these systems lack credibility, especially for companies with 
questionable performance records.  Standards for supply chain auditing are highly 
variable.  Among the most trusted are the brand certification system of the Fair Labor 
Association (FLA) and the SA8000 factory certification system, both of which involve 
multi-stakeholder governance structures.  Similar to the hybrid initiatives discussed in the 
previous section, the credibility of voluntary accountability mechanisms is enhanced by

<p><b>66 </b> A test of this proposition is currently under way. The Business Social Compliance Initiative, a European 
network of retailers, industry and importing companies, has formed a strategic alliance with SA8000 and 
become an &#8220;organizational stakeholder&#8221; in GRI. That ought to generate credibility benefits.  At the same 
time, the world&#8217;s four largest supermarket chains, Wal-Mart, Tesco, Carrefour, and Metro are launching 
their own initiative with no external stakeholder involvement and, to date, no transparency.  The 
proposition would predict difficulties ahead. During a recent US court case against Wal-Mart for alleged 
labour violations in the factories of overseas suppliers, a company attorney stated that its supplier code of 
conduct &#8220;creates certain rights for Wal-Mart. It does not create certain rights and obligations on behalf of 
Wal-Mart&#8221;.  While the claim may be legally correct, it leaves unanswered the question of just what 
promises to workers and consumers the company&#8217;s code is intended to convey, and how the public can be 
assured that the promise is being kept. (Josh Gerstein, &#8220;Novel Legal Challenge to Wal-Mart Appears to be 
Faltering on Coast&#8221;, http://www.nysun.com/article/45009). </p>
