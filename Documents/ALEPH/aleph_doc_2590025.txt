NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
June 30, 2016
(tabular amounts are in thousands of U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated)
NOTE 1  NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES
Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation
McEwen Mining Inc. (the “Company” or “McEwen Mining”) was organized under the laws of the
State of Colorado on July 24, 1979.  Since inception, the Company has been engaged in the
exploration for, development of, production and sale of gold and silver.
The Company operates in Mexico, Argentina, and the United States.  It owns and operates the
producing El Gallo 1 Mine in Sinaloa, Mexico. It also owns a 49% interest in Minera Santa Cruz
S.A. (“MSC”), owner and operator of the producing San José Mine in Santa Cruz, Argentina,
which is controlled by the majority owner of the joint venture, Hochschild Mining plc
(‘‘Hochschild’’). In addition to its operating properties, the Company holds interests in numerous
exploration stage properties and projects in Mexico, Argentina and the United States.
The interim consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by the
Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”).  Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and
regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures included are adequate to make
the information presented not misleading.
In management’s opinion, the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the
Consolidated Balance Sheets as at June 30, 2016 (unaudited) and December 31, 2015, the
unaudited Consolidated Statement of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, contained herein, reflect all adjustments, consisting
solely of normal recurring items, which are necessary for the fair presentation of the Company’s
financial position, results of operations and cash flows on a basis consistent with that of the
Company’s prior audited consolidated financial statements.  However, the results of operations
for the interim periods may not be indicative of results to be expected for the full fiscal
year.  Therefore, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited
financial statements and notes thereto and summary of significant accounting policies included in
the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Except as
noted below, there have been no material changes in the footnotes from those accompanying the
audited consolidated financial statements contained in the Company’s Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015.  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company accounts and transactions have
been eliminated.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718) – Improvements to employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting:  In March 2016, the FASB Issued ASU No. 2016-09, which changes how
companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees, including
the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well
as classification in the statement of cash flows. The update to the standard is effective for the
Company beginning June 1, 2017, with early application permitted. The Company is currently
evaluating the effect the guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.
Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323) - Simplifying the Transition to the
Equity Method of Accounting: In March 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-07, which affects all
entities that have an investment that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting as a
result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. The amendments
eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a
result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must
adjust the investment, results

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

(tabular amounts are in thousands of U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated)
of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method
had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The
amendments are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal
years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively
upon their effective date to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that
result in the adoption of the equity method. Earlier application is permitted. The Company is
currently evaluating the potential impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial
statements.
Financial Instruments — Overall (Subtopic 825-10) - Recognition and Measurement of Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities: In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, which
updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial
instruments. ASU 2016-01 will be effective for the Company beginning in its second quarter of
2019. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact this guidance will have on its
consolidated financial statements.
Revenue from Contracts with Customers – Deferral of the Effective Date: In August 2015, the
FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which defers the effective date of ASU 2015-09. ASU 2015-09
outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from
contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including
industry-specific guidance. The effective date of this pronouncement is for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2017.  Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting
period. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact this guidance will have on its
consolidated financial statements.

certain publicly-traded companies. The Company classifies the marketable equity securities as

As of June 30, 2016, the cost of the marketable equity securities and warrants was approximately
$1.8 million (December 31, 2015 - $1.9 million).
On May 13, 2016, the Company participated in a private placement with Golden Predator Mining
Corp. (“Golden Predator”) under which it acquired 3,125,000 units, each unit consisting of one
common share and one common share

(tabular amounts are in thousands of U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated)
purchase warrant (“warrant”), for a total cost of $0.4 million. Using proportional allocation, the
Company allocated $0.2 million as the cost base for each to the common shares and warrants.
As the warrants meet the definition of derivative instruments, unrealized gains or losses arising
from their revaluation are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and
Comprehensive Income (Loss). During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the
Company recorded an unrealized gain of $1.7 million.
In addition, during the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company sold marketable equity
securities for proceeds of $0.5 million.  The Company realized a gain of $0.1 million, which is
included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company reviewed its investment portfolio to
determine if any security was other-than-temporarily impaired (“OTTI”). An OTTI security would
require the Company to record an impairment charge in the income statement in the period any
such determination is made. In making this judgment, the Company evaluated, among other
things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security was less than its cost; the
financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the Company’s intent to sell, or
whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized
cost basis.
From this assessment the Company concluded that the fair value of certain marketable equity
securities exhibited a prolonged decline in share price due to deterioration of the issuer’s results;
therefore, the decline in these marketable equity securities was considered OTTI.  Accordingly,
the Company recognized an OTTI impairment loss of $0.6 million and $0.9 million on the
Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016, respectively.
For the remaining marketable equity securities, the Company recorded a gain, net of tax, in other
comprehensive income, of $1.6 million and $1.5 million for the three and six months ended June
30, 2016.  The gain was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and is reported
as a separate line item in the shareholders' equity section of the balance sheet.
The gains and losses for available-for-sale securities are not reported in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) until the securities are sold or if
there is an other-than-temporary decline in fair value below cost.

NOTE 4 MINERAL PROPERTY INTEREST AND ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS
Mineral Property Interests
On April 19, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of the sliding scale net smelter return
royalty (the “Royalty”) on the El Gallo 1 Mine and El Gallo 2 project, previously requiring payment
of 3.5% of gross revenue less allowable deductions, eventually reducing to 1%. The purchase
price consisted of a $5.3 million payment at closing and a deferred payment of $1.0
million on June 30, 2018, conditional that the El Gallo 1 Mine and El Gallo 2 project are in
operation at that time.
The total cost of the Royalty was accounted for as an addition to mineral property interests.  The
cost was allocated to El Gallo 1 Mine and El Gallo 2 project based on the relative fair value of the
future royalty payments for each project. The allocation resulted in approximately $5.1 million
allocated to the El Gallo 1 Mine and $1.2 million allocated to the El Gallo 2 project. The $1.0
million conditional deferred payment has been included under non-current other liabilities as of
June 30, 2016.  The Royalty ceased accruing at the end of March 2016.
The Company conducts a review of potential triggering events for evaluation of all its mineral
projects on a quarterly basis. When events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related
carrying amounts may not be recoverable, the Company carries out a review and evaluation of its
long-lived assets for impairment, in accordance with its accounting policy.  During the six months
ended June 30, 2016, the Company did not identify events or changes in circumstances affecting
the carrying values of its long-lived assets.
During the quarter ended June 30, 2015, the Company performed a strategic review of its mineral
property interests in Nevada. A decision was made to allow certain non-essential claims and
portions of claims, included within the Gold Bar Complex and Tonkin Complex, to lapse on the
September 1, 2015 renewal date and therefore reduce property holding costs that otherwise
would have been incurred in the third quarter of 2015. This resulted in a pre-tax impairment
charge of $19.7 million for the Gold Bar project and $8.9 million for the Tonkin Project, and an
income tax recovery of $10.0 million recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations
and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015.
Asset Retirement Obligations
The Company is responsible for reclamation of certain past and future disturbances at its
properties.  The two most significant properties subject to these obligations are the Tonkin
property in Nevada and the El Gallo 1 Mine in Mexico.
A reconciliation of the Company’s asset retirement obligations for the six months ended June 30,
2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015 are as follows:

Amortization of Mineral Property Interests and Asset Retirement Costs
The definition of proven and probable reserves is set forth in the SEC Industry Guide 7. If proven
and probable reserves exist at any of the Company’s properties, the relevant capitalized mineral
property interests and asset retirement costs for that property are charged to expense based on
the units of production method upon commencement of production. Since the Company has not
completed feasibility or other studies sufficient to characterize the mineralized material at the El
Gallo 1 Mine as proven or probable reserves, the amortization of the capitalized mineral property
interests and asset retirement costs are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Operations
and Comprehensive Income (Loss) based on the most appropriate amortization method, which
includes the straight-line or units of production method over the estimated useful life of the mine.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recorded $0.8 million and $1.1
million, respectively (June 30, 2015, $0.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively), of amortization
expense related to the El Gallo 1 Mine, which are included in Production Costs Applicable to
Sales in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016, of which $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively,
related to the amortization of capitalized asset retirement costs (June 30, 2015 - $0.1 million and
$0.1 million, respectively).
NOTE 5   INVESTMENT IN MINERA SANTA CRUZ S.A. (“MSC”) – SAN JOSÉ MINE
The Company’s 49% attributable share of results of operations from its investment in MSC was
income of $4.1 million and $9.1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016,
respectively (June 30, 2015 – losses of $2.7 million and $2.3 million, respectively). These
amounts include the amortization of the fair value increments arising from purchase price
allocation and related income tax recovery. Included in the income tax recovery is the impact of
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Argentine peso and the U.S. dollar on the peso-
denominated deferred tax liability associated with the investment in MSC recorded as part of the
acquisition of Minera Andes in 2012. As a devaluation of the Argentine peso relative to the U.S.
dollar results in a recovery of deferred income taxes, the impact has been an increase in the
income from the Company’s investment in MSC for the three and six months ended June 30,
2016.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company received $2.8 million and
$5.4 million in dividends from MSC, respectively.  This compares to $0.5 million received during
the three and six months ended June 30, 2015.
Changes in the Company’s investment in MSC for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and year
ended December 31, 2015 are as follows:

of impairment charges, MSC had current assets of $107.0 million, total assets of $293.4 million,
current liabilities of $49.1 million, and total liabilities of $81.9 million as at June 30, 2016.
NOTE 6   PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment included a deposit with a contractor for the construction of certain
equipment pertaining to the El Gallo 2 project, which was accounted for under construction-in-
process. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company reached an agreement with
the contractor, whereby the Company was refunded the deposit less costs incurred for the
equipment design. The total cost of the deposit was $1.5 million, of which $1.0 million was
refunded. The remaining $0.5 million was recorded to development costs in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).
As of June 30, 2016, property and equipment was $14.0 million (December 31, 2015 - $15.8
million), net of accumulated depreciation of $5.2 million (December 31, 2015 - $4.7 million).
NOTE 7   SHORT-TERM BANK INDEBTEDNESS
On May 29, 2015, Compañía Minera Pangea (“CMP”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company, finalized a line of credit agreement with Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior
(“Banco Nacional”), for an amount up to 90,000,000 Mexican pesos (approximately $5.9 million
as of May 29, 2015), which was secured by CMP’s Value Added Tax (“VAT”) receivable
balance.  The applicable interest rate was equal to: (i) two and one-half percent (2.5%) per
annum plus (ii) the 91 day Interbank Equilibrium Interest Rate (“TIIE”) rate, as published by the
Bank of Mexico, payable quarterly. Upon signing the agreement, CMP paid a 1% commission on
the total value of the simple credit agreement to Banco Nacional.
On June 1, 2015, CMP drew down the entire 90,000,000 Mexican pesos, equivalent to $5.2
million as of December 31, 2015, on the line of credit. During the year ended December 31,
2015, CMP collected 34,654,201 Mexican pesos (equivalent to $2.0 million as of December 31,
2015) of VAT receivable, from which 2,903,100 Mexican pesos were applied against the accrued
interest and the remaining 31,751,101 Mexican pesos (approximately $1.8 million as of
December 31, 2015) were applied against the principal.

On January 13, 2016, CMP paid the remaining balance of the indebtedness in the amount of
58,248,899 Mexican Pesos (approximately $3.4 million as of June 30, 2016).  Upon the final
payment, the line of credit agreement was terminated.
NOTE 8   SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, 3.6 million exchangeable shares were converted
into common stock (June 30, 2015 – 1.4 million).  At June 30, 2016, outstanding exchangeable
shares not exchanged and not owned by the Company or its subsidiaries totaled 20.6 million
(June 30, 2015 – 27.1 million).
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, 811,334 shares of common stock were issued upon
exercise of stock options under the Equity Incentive Plan, at a weighted average exercise price of
$2.33 per share for proceeds of $1.9 million.  In comparison, there were no exercises of stock
options during the same period of 2015.
On June 18, 2015, the Board of Directors declared an annual return of capital distribution of
$0.01 per share of common stock, payable semi-annually.  The first semi-annual return of capital
distribution payment of $0.005 was made on August 17, 2015 and the second payment of $0.005
was made on February 12, 2016, each for a total of $1.5 million. Return of capital distributions
are paid to holders of the Company’s common stock and exchangeable shares.
On October 1, 2015, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the
Company to purchase up to 15,000,000 shares of its common stock over a twelve month period,
with an authorized maximum of $15.0 million to be spent on the repurchases. Under the program,
purchases of common stock may be made from time-to-time in the open market, subject to
compliance with applicable U.S. and Canadian laws. The timing and amounts of any purchase
are based on market conditions and other factors including share price, regulatory requirements
and capital availability.  Further, the repurchase program may be suspended, discontinued or
modified at any time, at the discretion of the Board of Directors. During the six months ended
June 30, 2016 the Company repurchased 557,991 shares of common stock (year-ended
December 31, 2015 - 1,896,442) at a total cost of $0.6 million (December 31, 2015 - $1.8 million),
all of which have been cancelled.
During the six months ended June 30, 2015, the Company issued 430,295 shares of common
stock under an agreement with one of its mining contractors to settle parts of its accounts payable
for services rendered. The fair value of the common stock at the time of issuance was $0.4
million. The agreement with this mining contractor expired and was renegotiated during 2015
and under the revised agreement, the Company can no longer make share payments and
instead is required to pay in cash.
At the annual meeting held on May 31, 2016, the holders of exchangeable shares of McEwen
Mining-Minera Andes Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“MAQ”),
voted to amend its Articles of Incorporation to allow early redemption of all outstanding
exchangeable shares for common stock of the Company.   On July 25, 2016, the Company
announced that MAQ had established a redemption date of August 23, 2016 in respect of all of its
outstanding exchangeable shares and that McEwen Mining (Alberta) ULC ("McEwen (Alberta)")
elected to exercise its overriding redemption call right to acquire all of the outstanding
exchangeable shares (other than exchangeable shares held by the Company and its
subsidiaries) on the business day immediately prior to the redemption date, being August 22,
2016.  On August 22, 2016, it is anticipated that McEwen (Alberta) will acquire all of the
exchangeable shares not yet redeemed for purchase consideration of one share of the
Company’s common stock per exchangeable share. Following the redemption, it is expected that
MAQ will apply to have the exchangeable shares delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange
(“TSX”). After August 22, 2016, former holders of exchangeable shares will not have any rights as
holders thereof other than the right to receive shares of the Company’s common stock.

NOTE 9   STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, no stock options were granted to employees or
directors.  In comparison, during the six months ended June 30, 2015, the Company granted
stock options to certain employees for an aggregate of 0.1 million shares of common stock at a
weighted average exercise price of $1.07 per share. The options vest equally over a three-year
period (subject to acceleration of vesting in certain events) if the individual remains affiliated with
the Company and are exercisable for a period of 5 years from the date of issue.
The principal assumptions used in applying the Black-Scholes option pricing model for these
awards were as follows:

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recorded stock option
expense of $0.1 million and $0.5 million respectively.  This compares to $0.2 million and $0.8
million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015.
NOTE 10   INCOME TAXES
The Company’s income tax expense differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S.
federal and state statutory corporate income tax rate of 35% to income before taxes primarily
resulting from valuation allowances being applied to losses, changes in recognition of certain
deferred tax assets, changes in the deferred tax liability associated with mineral property
interests acquired in the Minera Andes acquisition and changes due to impairment of mineral
property interests. The deferred tax liability is impacted by fluctuations in the foreign exchange
rate between the Argentine peso and U.S. dollar.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recorded an income tax
recovery of $0.4 million and $2.3 million, respectively, as a result of the Argentine peso
devaluation.  In comparison, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, the Company
recorded an income tax recovery of $0.8 million and $2.0 million, respectively, resulting from the
Argentine peso devaluation.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, the Company recorded an income tax
recovery of $10.0 million, corresponding to the impairment of mineral property interests described
in Note 4, Mineral Property Interest and Asset Retirement Obligations.
NOTE 11   INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE
Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) available to
common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period. Diluted net income per share is computed similarly except that the weighted average
number of common shares is increased to reflect all dilutive instruments.

NOTE 14   FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING
Fair value accounting establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation
techniques used to measure fair value.  The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and
the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).  The three levels of the fair
value hierarchy are described below:
Level 1Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date
for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;
Level 2Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly
or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and
Level 3Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value
measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis
The following table identifies the fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities as
reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 by level
within the fair value hierarchy.  As required by accounting guidance, assets and liabilities are
classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
measurement.

The Company's investments mainly consist of marketable equity securities which are exchange
traded, and which are valued using quoted market prices in active markets and are classified
within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the investments is calculated as the
quoted market price of the marketable equity security multiplied by the number of shares held by
the Company.
Further, as noted in Note 2, Investments, the Company’s investments also include warrants to
purchase common stock of Golden Predator. Since these warrants are not traded on an active
market, they are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and classified within Level
2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of other financial assets and liabilities approximate their carrying values due to
their short-term nature and historically negligible credit losses.
NOTE 15   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Surety Bonds
As part of its ongoing business and operations, the Company is required to provide bonding for
its environmental reclamation obligations in the United States. These surety bonds are available
for draw down by the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) in the event the Company does not
perform its reclamation obligations. When the specific reclamation requirements are met, the
beneficiary of the surety bonds will cancel and/or return the instrument to the issuing entity. The
Company believes it is in compliance with all applicable bonding obligations and will be able to
satisfy future bonding requirements, through existing or alternative means, as they arise.
As at June 30, 2016, there were $4.8 million of surety bonds outstanding (December 31, 2015 -
$4.8 million). The annual financing fees are 1.5% of the value of the surety bonds, with a required
initial deposit of 10% ($0.5 million), which is included in Other Assets in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet.

Item 2.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
In the following discussion, “McEwen Mining”, the “Company”, “we”, “our”, and “us” refers to
McEwen Mining Inc. and as the context requires, its consolidated subsidiaries.
The following discussion updates our plan of operation as of August 4, 2016 for the foreseeable
future. It also analyzes our financial condition at June 30, 2016 and compares it to our financial
condition at December 31, 2015. Finally, the discussion analyzes our results of operations for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and compares those to the results for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2015.  With regard to properties or projects that are not in production,
we provide some details of our plan of operation. We suggest that you read this discussion in
conjunction with MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS and our audited consolidated financial
statements contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
The discussion also presents certain Non-GAAP financial performance measures, such as
earnings from mining operations, total cash costs, total cash cost per ounce, all-in sustaining
costs, all-in sustaining cost per ounce, all-in costs, all-in cost per ounce, average realized price
per ounce, and cash investments and precious metals, that are important to management in its
evaluation of our operating results and which are used by management to compare our
performance to what we perceive to be peer group mining companies and relied on as part of
management’s decision-making process. Management believes these measures may also be
important to investors in evaluating our performance. For a detailed description of each of the
Non-GAAP financial performance measures and certain limitations inherent in such measures,
please see the discussion under “Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures” below, on page
35.
Reliability of Information: Minera Santa Cruz S.A. (“MSC”), the owner of the San José Mine, is
responsible for and has supplied to us all reported results from the San José Mine.  The financial
and technical information contained herein is, with few exceptions as noted, based entirely on
information provided to us by MSC.  Our joint venture partner, a subsidiary of Hochschild Mining
plc, and its affiliates other than MSC do not accept responsibility for the use of project data or the
adequacy or accuracy of this information.
CAUTIONARY NOTE TO UNITED STATES INVESTORS — INFORMATION CONCERNING
PREPARATION OF RESOURCE AND RESERVE ESTIMATES
McEwen Mining Inc. is required to prepare reports under the Canadian Securities Administrators’
National Instrument 43-101 “Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects” (“NI 43-101”), under
the Canadian securities laws because our stock is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”)
and we are subject to Canadian securities laws. These standards are materially different from the
standards generally required in reports filed with SEC.
Definitions of terms under NI 43-101 differ materially from the definitions of those and related
terms in Industry Guide 7 (“Industry Guide 7”) promulgated by the SEC.  Under U.S. standards,
mineralization may not be classified as a “reserve” unless a determination has been made that
the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the
reserve determination is made.  Under Industry Guide 7 standards, a “Final” or “Bankable”
feasibility study or other report is required to report reserves, the three-year historical average
precious metals prices are used in any reserve or cash flow analysis to designate reserves and
the primary environmental analysis or report must be filed with and approved by the appropriate
government authority.
One consequence of these differences is that “reserves” calculated in accordance with Canadian
standards may not be “reserves” under Industry Guide 7 standards.  U.S. investors should be
aware that McEwen Mining’s properties located in Argentina (with the exception of the San José
Mine), Mexico and the United States do not have “reserves” as defined by Industry Guide 7 and
are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the disclosed mineralized material will be
confirmed or converted into Industry Guide 7 compliant “reserves”.
19
Table of Contents
Further, since we have not established reserves on some of our properties as defined in Industry
Guide 7, we have in the past and will continue to expense substantially all design, construction
and development costs with regard to those properties, even though these expenditures are
expected to have a future economic benefit in excess of one year. Only certain types of property
and equipment which have alternative uses or significant salvage value may be capitalized
without proven and probable reserves. We also expense our asset retirement obligations on
those properties. Companies that have reserves under Industry Guide 7 typically capitalize these
costs, and subsequently depreciate or amortize them on a units-of-production basis as reserves
are mined. Unlike these other companies, we depreciate or amortize any capitalized costs on a
straight-line basis based on the estimated remaining useful life of the mine, as determined by our
internal mine plans. As a result of these and other differences, our financial statements may not
be comparable to the financial statements of mining companies that have established reserves.
Under NI 43-101, we report measured, indicated and inferred resources, which are
measurements that are generally not permitted in filings made with the SEC. The estimation of
measured and indicated resources involves greater uncertainty as to their existence and
economic feasibility than the estimation of proven and probable reserves under Industry Guide 7.
U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that any part of measured or indicated resources will
ever be converted into economically mineable reserves. The estimation of inferred resources
involves far greater uncertainty as to their existence and economic viability than the estimation of
other categories of resources. Although it is expected that the majority of inferred resources could
be upgraded to the indicated category, U.S. investors are also cautioned not to assume that all or
any part of inferred resources exist, or that they can be mined legally or economically.
Canadian regulations permit the disclosure of resources in terms of “contained ounces” provided
that the tonnes and grade for each resource are also disclosed; however, the SEC only permits
issuers to report “mineralized material” in tonnage and average grade without reference to
contained ounces. Under U.S. regulations, the tonnage and average grade sometimes disclosed
by us would be characterized as mineralized material. We provide such disclosure about our
properties to allow a means of comparing our projects to those of other companies in the mining
industry, many of which are Canadian and report pursuant to NI 43-101, and to comply with
applicable disclosure requirements.
We also note that drill results are not indicative of mineralized material in other areas where we
have mining interests. Furthermore, mineralized material identified on our properties does not
and may never have demonstrated economic or legal viability.
Overview
We were organized under the laws of the State of Colorado on July 24, 1979.  Since inception,
we have been engaged in the exploration for, development of, production and sale of gold and

interest in MSC, owner and operator of the producing San José Mine in Santa Cruz,
Argentina.  We also own the Gold Bar Project in Nevada, United States; the Los Azules Project
in San Juan, Argentina, and a large portfolio of exploration properties in Argentina, Mexico and
the United States.
In this report, “Au” represents gold; “Ag” represents silver; “oz” represents troy ounce; “gpt”
represents grams per metric tonne; “ft.” represents feet; “m” represents meter; “km” represents
kilometer; “sq.” represents square; and C$ refers to Canadian dollars. All of our financial
information is reported in United States (U.S.) dollars, unless otherwise noted.

Operating and Financial Highlights
·We produced 39,555 gold equivalent ounces in the second quarter of 2016, which includes
15,640 gold equivalent ounces from the El Gallo 1 Mine in Mexico and 23,915 gold equivalent
ounces attributable to us from our 49% interest in the San José Mine in Argentina. Production
slightly increased year-over-year by 1% due to higher number of tonnes processed at the San
José Mine, partially offset by lower number of tonnes processed and lower grades obtained at
the El Gallo 1 Mine.
·Our total cash costs, all-in sustaining costs and all-in costs for our operations on a consolidated
basis for the second quarter of 2016 totaled $719, $942 and $1,201 per gold equivalent ounce
sold, respectively. Total cash costs and all-in sustaining cash costs at our El Gallo 1 Mine for the
second quarter totaled $465 and $495 per gold equivalent ounce sold, respectively. Total cash
costs and all-in sustaining costs at the San José Mine for the second quarter of 2016 totaled
$849 and $1,075 per gold equivalent ounce sold, respectively.
·The year-over-year increase in total cash costs per gold equivalent ounce in the second quarter
reflects lower grades of ore processed during that period, partially offset by the devaluation in
both the Argentinean and Mexican Pesos in the quarter, impacting costs denominated in these
currencies.
21
Table of Contents
·The decrease in all-in sustaining costs per gold equivalent ounce in the second quarter results
from lower pre-stripping costs at our El Gallo 1 Mine, coupled with lower exploration, mine
development and capital expenditures incurred at the San José Mine during the 2016 period.
·The year-over-year increase in all-in costs per gold equivalent ounce reflects the $5.3 million
addition to mineral property interests as a result of the acquisition of the El Gallo royalty, which
was completed on the second quarter of 2016.
·We sold 34,373 gold equivalent ounces in the second quarter of 2016, which includes 11,593
gold equivalent ounces from the El Gallo 1 Mine and 22,780 gold equivalent ounces attributable
to us from our 49% interest in the San José Mine.
·The average realized sale price per ounce for our operations on a consolidated basis in the
second quarter of 2016 was $1,267 and $18.08 per ounce of gold and silver sold, respectively.
These compare to $1,172 and $15.34 per ounce of gold and silver sold in the second quarter of
2015. Average realized prices are presented net of adjustments of provisionally priced sales of
concentrates from the San José Mine.
·Our 2016 production guidance remains at 99,500 gold ounces and 3.3 of million silver ounces.
Production guidance for 2016 at the El Gallo 1 Mine is estimated as 54,500 gold ounces
whereas for our share of production at the San José Mine we estimated 45,000 gold ounces and
3.3 million silver ounces. Consolidated production guidance is estimated in a range of 140,000
to 150,000 gold equivalent ounces.
·We reported consolidated net income of $8.4 million, or $0.03 per share for the second quarter
of 2016, compared to a net loss of $14.1 million, or $0.05 per share for the comparable period in
2015. The net income for the second quarter of 2016 was the combined result of the absence of
any impairment charges in the 2016 period, the increase in net income from our investment in
MSC; lower production costs due to lower number of ounces sold at the El Gallo 1 Mine and
reduced exploration costs incurred during the second quarter of 2016, compared to the same
period in 2015.
·Consolidated earnings from mining operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 were $19.3
million, compared to consolidated earnings of $13.4 million for the comparable period in
2015.  The increase is the result of the overall improvement in MSC’s operations reported during
the quarter.
·We ended the second quarter of 2016 with $55.7 million in cash, investments and precious
metals, and no outstanding debt.  In comparison, we ended the second quarter of 2015 with
$28.9 million in cash, investments and precious metals, and $5.8 million in outstanding debt. For
a reconciliation of precious metals valued at the London PM Fix spot price and cost, please see
the discussion under “Non GAAP Financial Performance Measures” below, on page 35.
Consolidated Performance
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, our net income was $8.4 million or $0.03 per share,
compared to a net loss of $14.1 million or $0.05 per share for the second quarter in 2015. The
improvement in operations was mainly due to the absence of any impairment charges in the
2016 period.  The other significant improvement was the $4.1 million net income recognized from
our investment in MSC during 2016, compared to a net loss of $2.7 million in 2015.  In addition,
during the second quarter of 2016 we reported a decrease in production costs resulting from a
lower number of ounces sold, coupled with a decrease in exploration costs and general and
administrative expenses, partially offset by higher mine development costs related to the
advancement of our Gold Bar project during the 2016 period.
During the second quarter ended June 30, 2016, we produced 27,888 ounces of gold and
875,006 ounces of silver, compared to 28,483 ounces of gold and 801,119 ounces of silver in the
same period of 2015.  Production of gold slightly decreased by 2% as a result of a 16% decrease
in the number of tonnes processed at the El Gallo 1 Mine, coupled with lower grades obtained,
which was partly offset by increases of 10% and 9% in the number of ounces of gold and silver
produced by MSC. Production costs applicable to sales decreased 21% to $5.8 million in 2016
from $7.3 million in 2015, as a result of the lower number of ounces of gold sold by the El Gallo 1
Mine, previously mentioned.
22
Table of Contents
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, our net income was $21.3 million or $0.07 per
share, compared to a net loss of $8.1 million or $0.03 per share for the same period in 2015. The
net income in 2016 is mainly due to no impairments, the improved operations at the San Jose
Mine, which resulted in a net income of $9.1 million recognized from our investment in MSC,
compared to a net loss of $2.3 million in the 2015 period. Other contributors to the increase in net
income were the decrease in production costs resulting from lower number of ounces sold in the
period, coupled with lower mining costs obtained from certain vendors, as well as the decrease
in general and administrative expenses compared to the previous period.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 we produced 56,863 ounces of gold and 1,548,773
ounces of silver, compared to 53,179 ounces of gold and 1,456,458 ounces of silver in the same
period of 2015.  Production of gold increased as a result of higher number of tonnes processed at
the San Jose mines, partly offset by a decrease in average grades and recoveries at the San
Jose and El Gallo 1 mines.  Production costs applicable to sales decreased 16% to $14.8 million
in 2016 from $17.7 million in 2015.
Results of Consolidated Operations
Three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to three months ended June 30, 2015
Gold and silver sales in the three months ended June 30, 2016 totaled $14.6 million, compared
to $16.2 million for the same period in 2015. The decrease in revenue was due to a 10%
decrease in the number of gold ounces sold from our El Gallo 1 Mine, partly offset by a 6%
increase in the average realized sales prices of gold during the three months ended June 30,
2016 compared to the same period in 2015.
Total costs and expenses, excluding impairment charges, in the three months ended June 30,
2016 was $7.9 million, compared to $17.3 million in the 2015 period, a decrease of 55%. The
significant decrease was primarily a result of higher income from our investment in MSC, coupled
with lower production, property holding and general and administrative costs incurred during the
period.
Production costs applicable to sales at the El Gallo 1 Mine decreased by 21% to $5.8 million in
the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $7.3 million for the same period in 2015,
due to a 15% decrease in the number of ounces of gold equivalent ounces sold, coupled with
lower costs obtained from certain vendors’ contracts that were renegotiated during the first
quarter of 2016 and the impact of the Mexican peso devaluation against the U.S. dollar.  The
decrease was partly offset by lower production grades obtained during the 2016
period.  Production costs consist of direct mining costs which include contract mining services,
processing costs, personnel costs, certain general and administrative costs, energy costs,
operating materials and supplies, repairs and maintenance costs, transport fees, royalty expense
and third-party refining costs. Production cost applicable to sales is calculated based on the
weighted average cost of ounces sold during the period.
Mine development costs, which are comprised of engineering and development costs incurred at
our advanced-stage properties, increased to $1.3 million during the three months ended June 30,
2016 compared to $0.2 million during the same period in 2015. The increase relates to costs
incurred in the advancement of our Gold Bar and El Gallo 2 projects in the later period. As
described in the “Advanced-stage Properties” section below, our designation of certain properties
as “Advanced-stage Properties” should not suggest that we have proven or probable reserves at
those properties as defined by the SEC Industry Guide 7.
Exploration costs in the second quarter of 2016 decreased to $1.7 million from $3.1 million in the
same period of 2015, due to lower exploration activity in Argentina, Mexico and Nevada. For
Argentina, during the 2016 period, we spent $0.2 million in engineering work, compared to $0.7
million in the prior year.  For Mexico, in the 2016 period, we spent $0.9 million in exploration
expenditures mostly at the Magistral area, compared to $1.3 million in the same period in 2015.
For Nevada, we spent $0.6 million in exploration expenditures mostly at the Afgan-Kobeh
project, which compares to $1.1 million incurred at other projects during the same period in 2015.
We have reduced exploration activity to focus on the development of the Gold Bar project.

Table of Contents
Property holding costs decreased period-over-period to $0.3 million in the 2016 period from $0.5
million in the 2015 period as a result of a lower number of Mexican claims held, coupled with a
devaluation of the Mexican Peso during the three month period of 2016.
General and administrative expenses decreased by 21% to $2.6 million from $3.3 million during
the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 as a result of the
devaluation of the Canadian dollar, Mexican peso and Argentinean peso against the U.S. dollar
during the 2016 period in comparison with the 2015 period.
Our income on investment in MSC, net of amortization, during the three months ended June 30,
2016 was $4.1 million, compared to net loss on investment of $2.7 million in the 2015 period. The
income realized in 2016 is the result of MSC’s higher net sales obtained from the higher volume
of ounces of silver and gold sold coupled with higher average realized prices. In addition,
production costs were lower in the period due to a reduction in stoppage costs, export duties,
capital expenditures, and the devaluation of the Argentinean peso against the U.S. dollar, which
also contributed to the improvement of MSC’s operating performance during the quarter.
No impairment has been recognized during the three months ended June 30, 2016.  In
comparison, during the same period of 2015, we recognized a total pre-tax impairment of $28.5
million in our Nevada properties. This impairment resulted from our decision to drop non-
essential claims at the Tonkin and Gold Bar projects, in order to reduce annual property holding
costs.
Interest and other income decreased to an expense of $0.1 million during the three months
ended June 30, 2016 from income of $3.2 million in 2015. The balance in 2015 included an
accrual for insurance proceeds receivable related to the theft of gold in concentrate stolen from
our refinery in Mexico.
Other-than-temporary impairment on marketable equity securities increased to $0.6 million during
the three months ended June 30, 2016, from $nil in the same period in 2015, due to the
recognition of an impairment in the value of certain marketable securities held at June 30, 2016.
We recognized an unrealized gain of $1.7 million from the warrants acquired on May 13, 2016
through a private placement offered by another mining company. Details of the valuation of these
instruments are provided in Note 2 – Investments and Note 14 – Fair value accounting of the
consolidated financial statements.
Recovery of income taxes was $0.9 million during the three months ended June 30, 2016,
compared to $12.3 million in the 2015 period.  The decrease was the result of the $10.0 million
tax recovery included in 2015 resulting from the impairment of certain properties, and larger
foreign exchange devaluation in 2015, particularly in Argentina.
Six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to six months ended June 30, 2015
Gold and silver sales in the six months ended June 30, 2016 totaled $35.8 million.  This
compares to $39.0 million for the same period in 2015. The decrease in revenue is the result of
the 8% lower number of gold equivalent ounces sold during the 2016 period. Average realized
gold and silver prices for the six months ended June 30, 2016 remained unchanged from the
ones realized in the same period in 2015.
Total costs and expenses, excluding impairment charges, in the six months ended June 30, 2016
totaled $18.7 million, compared to $35.0 million in the 2015 period, a decrease of 46%. This
significant decrease in costs and expenses was mainly due to the improvement in MSC results,
which reported net income of $9.1 million for the 2016 period, compared to a net loss of $2.3
million during the 2015 period.  Further, total costs and expenses in 2016 were also lower due to
reduced production costs mostly associated with the lower number of ounces of gold and silver
sold in the six months endedof 2016.
Production costs applicable to sales at the El Gallo 1 Mine were $14.8 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2016, compared to $17.7 million for the same period in 2015. The 16% decrease
in production costs was due to an 8% lower
24
Table of Contents
number of ounces of gold sold by the El Gallo 1 Mine, coupled with lower costs realized from the
renegotiation of certain vendors’ contracts in the first quarter of the year and the impact of the
devaluation of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar.
Mine development costs during the six months ended June 30, 2016, were $2.0 million, of which
$1.3 million were incurred in our Gold Bar project.  In comparison, $0.3 million had been incurred
for the six months ended June 30, 2015, all of which relate to our El Gallo 2 project.
Exploration costs in 2016 decreased by 37% to $3.4 million, from $5.4 million in 2015, due to an
overall reduction in exploration expenditures as we concentrate efforts towards the development
of our advanced-stage properties. During the 2016 period, we spent $0.5 million in exploration
expenditures in Argentina primarily relating to basic geological work on the Los Azules Project,
compared to $0.9 million in the same period in 2015.  For Mexico, during the 2016 period, we
spent $1.6 million primarily on drilling at the El Gallo 1 Mine, compared to $2.9 million in the
same period in 2015.  For Nevada, we spent $1.2 million on exploration expenditures mainly at
the Afgan-Kobeh property, compared to $1.5 million in the comparable period in 2015 for infill
drilling at the Gold Bar project.
Property holding costs decreased by 30% to $1.4 million in the 2016 period, from $2.0 million in
the 2015 period.  primarily due to the devaluation of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar.
General and administrative expenses decreased by 17% in the 2016 period to $5.4 million
compared to $6.5 million in 2015, as a combination of our efforts to reduce costs and the
devaluation of the Canadian dollar, Mexican peso and Argentinean peso against the U.S. dollar
observed during the 2016.
Our income on investment in MSC, net of amortization, during the six months ended June 30,
2016 was $9.1 million, compared to a loss of $2.3 million in the 2015 period. The net income
reported in 2016 was due the overall improvement in MSC’s performance due to higher revenue
from higher number of gold and silver ounces sold at higher average realized prices, coupled
with lower production costs due to reduced export duties and taxes, the absence of stoppage
costs, and the reduction of exploration and development costs during the period ended June 30,
2016.  Further, during the six months ended June 30, 2016, the devaluation of the Argentinean
peso against the U.S. dollar had a greater impact than the increase in inflation noted in the
period, also contributing to the improvement of MSC’s results.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized no impairment charges. This
compares to $28.5 million, along with a deferred income tax recovery of $10.0 million, for a net
impairment charge of $18.5 million of the Gold Bar and Tonkin projects, for the six months ended
June 30, 2015.
Interest income and other income during the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $0.2
million.  This compares to an income of $3.1 million during the same period in 2015.  In 2015 we
reported a greater balance due to the accrual of insurance proceeds receivable related to the
theft of gold concentrate stolen from our refinery in Mexico, reported in April 2015, and which
were collected on July 16, 2015.
Other-than-temporary impairment on marketable equity securities increased to $0.9 million during
the six months ended June 30, 2016, from $nil in the same period in 2015, due to the recognition
of an impairment in the value of certain marketable securities held at June 30, 2016.
Recovery of income taxes was $2.7 million in the 2016 period, compared to $13.5 million in the
2015 period.  The income tax recovery recognized in the first half of 2016 included $2.3 million
deferred tax recovery from the devaluation of the Argentine peso; while in 2015 the recovery of
income taxes includes a deferred income tax recovery of $10.0 million related to the impairment
discussed above, in addition to $2.0 million deferred tax recovery from the devaluation of the
Argentine peso, recognized in 2015.

Total Cash Costs, All-In Sustaining Costs and All-In Costs
Total cash costs for all of our operating properties on a consolidated basis for the quarter ended
June 30, 2016 increased by 1% to $719 per gold equivalent ounce sold, compared to $713 per
gold equivalent ounce in the same period in 2015, based on a silver to gold ratio of 75:1 for both
periods. The increase is the net result of the 33% higher cash cost reported by the El Gallo 1
Mine and the 9% decrease in cash cost reported by MSC.  In 2015, we benefited from higher
average grades of mineral mined and processed at El Gallo 1 Mine, which in addition to
improved efficiencies resulted in a larger number of ounces produced and sold, at an overall
lower cost.  For MSC, cash costs were higher in the prior year mainly due to the additional cost
incurred from the work stoppage that took place in the first half of 2015.
On an aggregate basis, total cash costs decreased by 4% from $25.7 million to $24.7 million in
the three months ended June 30, 2016. In addition to the 5% decrease in number of gold
equivalent ounces sold during the second quarter of 2016, aggregate total cash costs were lower
because in 2016 MSC has benefited from lower export duties and the devaluation of the
Argentinean peso against the U.S. dollar.  In addition, during 2016 MSC has not been affected by
labour stoppages, compared to the 3 days stoppage that occurred in 2015.  On the contrary, our
El Gallo 1 Mine reported higher production costs as a result of higher haulage and exploration
costs incurred in the quarter.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, total cash costs for all of our operating properties on a
consolidated basis were $663 per gold equivalent ounce sold, compared to $693 per gold
equivalent ounce in the same period in 2015, based on a silver to gold ratio of 75:1 for both
periods. The 4% decrease in consolidated total cash costs on a per-ounce basis is due to the
overall decrease in aggregate production costs incurred by MSC, over a greater number of
ounces of gold equivalent sold at San Jose.  This decrease was partly offset by the 7% increase
in the total cash cost per ounce of gold equivalent sold at the El Gallo 1 Mine, which as
previously mentioned is associated with the lower average grades obtained from ore mined and
processed, which increased the production cost of the ounces of gold equivalent sold in the
period.
On an aggregate basis, total cash costs decreased by 3% to $49.7 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2016, from $51.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015. For 2016 MSC
reported a 3% decrease in the aggregate total cash cost despite having a 10% increase in the
number of gold equivalent ounces sold in the period. As previously mentioned, in 2016 MSC has
benefited from lower export duties and labour stoppage charges, and the continued devaluation
of the Argentinean peso, compared to the 2015 period.  The decrease in aggregate total cash
costs also reflects the 2% decrease in aggregate cash costs at El Gallo 1 Mine, mainly
associated with the 8% lower number of ounces of gold equivalent sold during the period
Consolidated all-in sustaining costs for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 decreased by 10% to
$942 per gold equivalent ounce, compared to $1,048 per gold equivalent ounce in the same
period in 2015, based on a silver to gold ratio of 75:1 used in both periods.  The decrease is due
to the 9% lower all-in sustaining cost reported by our El Gallo 1 Mine, coupled with the 12%
decrease reported by MSC during the period.
On an aggregate basis, all-in sustaining costs decreased by 14% to $32.4 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 from $37.7 million in the 2015 period.  The decrease was a result of
lower stripping costs at the El Gallo 1 Mine, coupled with lower exploration and capital
expenditures incurred at the San Jose mine during the period, and the devaluation of the
Mexican peso and Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. We also had lower corporate general
and administrative expenses in the current period.  Further, all-in sustaining costs were also
lower due to the reduced number of ounces of gold equivalent sold.
Consolidated all-in sustaining costs for the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by 12%
to $873 per gold equivalent ounce, compared to $997 per gold equivalent ounce in the same
period in 2015, based on a silver to gold ratio of 75:1 used in both periods.
On an aggregate basis, all-in sustaining costs were $65.4 million for the six months ended June
30, 2016. In comparison, all-in sustaining costs on an aggregate basis were $73.4 million in the
same period of 2015.  The 11% decrease was a result of lower all-in sustaining costs at our El
Gallo 1 Mine from the decrease in exploration and pre-stripping costs, as well as lower general
and administrative expenses incurred along with the devaluation of the Mexican peso and
Canadian dollar,
26

which were further reduced by the lower number of gold equivalent ounces sold in the 2016
period.  For MSC, despite the higher number of gold equivalent ounces sold at the San Jose
Mine, our attributable 49% share of interest in MSC was 6% lower than in the previous year, due
to lower exploration, mine development and capital expenditures incurred in 2016 when
compared to the 2015 period.
Consolidated all-in costs for the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased by 4% to $1,201
per gold equivalent ounce sold, compared to $1,151 per gold equivalent ounce in the same
period of 2015, based on a silver to gold ratio of 75:1, for both periods.
On an aggregate basis, all-in costs remained consistent at $41.3 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to $41.4 million in the three months ended June 30,
2015.  Aggregate all-in costs in 2016 consists of $5.3 million addition to El Gallo 1 and El Gallo 2
properties related to the royalty acquired in May 2016, and the $1.2 million higher mine
development costs associated with the advancement of the Gold Bar and El Gallo 2 advanced-
stage properties.  These additions were partly offset by the $1.2 million decrease in exploration
expenses as well as lower property holding costs incurred during the 2016 period.
Consolidated all-in costs for the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by 5% to $1,046 per
gold equivalent ounce sold, compared to $1,096 per gold equivalent ounce in the same period of
2015, based on a silver to gold ratio of 75:1, for both periods.
On an aggregate basis, all-in costs were 3% lower, at $78.4 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2015, compared to $80.8 million in the comparable period in 2015. In addition to the
lower costs from our 49% interest in MSC discussed above, all-in costs also decreased due to
lower property holding costs and exploration expenses, offset by the $5.3 million increase in
capital expenditures, related to the royalty acquired in May, as previously discussed.

Production
Production at the El Gallo 1 Mine for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 decreased by 11% to
15,640 gold equivalent ounces, from 17,325 gold equivalent ounces in the comparable period in
2015. The decrease is primarily a result of a 16% decrease in tonnes processed, coupled with a
37% decrease in average grades obtained from tonnes processed, in the 2016 period.  For the
second quarter of 2016, average grades obtained were 2.32 g/t compared to an average of 3.68
g/t obtained in 2015.  Such decrease was expected since we were mining from the higher grade
Samaniego pit in 2015.  As the Samaniego pit was substantially mined out in early 2016, we
have continued mining at the lower grade Lupita pit.  Furthermore, the 16% decrease in the
number of tonnes processed is aligned with the 19% decrease in the number of tonnes mined.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, production increased by 9% to 35,741 gold equivalent
ounces from 32,716 ounces in the first half of 2015. The increase in production, despite lower
grades and lower number of tonnes mined and processed during the six months ended of 2016,
was the result of the higher grade Samaniego ore placed on the leach pad towards the end of the
fourth quarter of 2015, now being realized.
Tonnes mined represent tonnes of ore extracted, while tonnes processed represent tonnes of ore
crushed and placed on the leach pads. The difference between tonnes mined of 289,037 and
tonnes processed of 267,524 during the three month ended June 30, 2016 corresponds to ore
deposited in the stockpiled inventory. Due to long process cycles, actual recoveries
28
Table of Contents
from the heap are difficult to measure and may fluctuate significantly based on the timing,
quantity and metallurgical attributes of new mineralized material placed on the leach pads,
among other variables. The cumulative recovery rate for gold production from September 1, 2012
(start of production at the El Gallo 1 Mine) to June 30, 2016 is estimated at 59%.
Sales
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, sales from the El Gallo 1 Mine amounted to $14.6
million, compared to $16.2 million for the same period in 2015. The 10% decrease is mainly due
to a 15% decrease in the number of gold equivalent ounces sold from 13,577 in the second
quarter of 2015 to 11,593 in the second quarter of 2016, partly offset by the increase of 6% and
5% in the average realized prices of gold and silver during the second quarter of 2016 compared
to 2015, respectively.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, sales from the El Gallo 1 Mine amounted to $35.8
million, compared to $39.0 million for the same period in 2015.  The 8% decrease is mainly due
to an 8% decrease in the number of ounces of gold equivalent sold from 32,394 in the second
quarter of 2015 to 29,694 in the second quarter of 2016.  Average prices of gold realized in the
second half of 2016 remained consistent when compared to the same period of 2015, while
average price of silver realized in 2016 was 5% lower.
Total Cash Costs and All-In Sustaining Costs
Total cash costs per gold equivalent ounce for the El Gallo 1 Mine for the quarter ended June 30,
2016 were $465, compared to $351 for the same period in 2015. The 33% increase in total cash
costs is primarily due to the decrease in the average grade of ore mined and processed in
Mexico, which were partly offset by the devaluation of the Mexican Peso against the US dollar in
the period. In comparison, during the same period of 2015 we benefited from higher average
grades of mineral mined and processed, which in addition to improved efficiencies resulted in a
larger number of ounces produced and sold, at an overall lower cost.  The decrease in the grade
is the result of moving from the higher grade Samaniego pit to the lower grade Lupita pit.  The
Samaniego pit was substantially mined out in early 2016.
On an aggregate basis, total cash costs increased by 13% to $5.4 million from $4.8 million in the
three months ended June 30, 2016. In addition to the 15% decrease in number of gold equivalent
ounces sold during the second quarter of 2016, aggregate total cash costs were higher because
in 2016 our El Gallo 1 Mine reported higher production costs as a result of higher haulage and
exploration costs incurred in the quarter, partly offset by reduced stripping charges during the
period.
All-in sustaining costs for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 were $495 per gold equivalent ounce,
compared to $546 per gold equivalent ounce in the same period in 2015.  The 9% reduction is
attributable to lower pre-stripping costs incurred in the quarter, compared to 2015
On an aggregate basis, all-in sustaining costs decreased by 23% to $5.7 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 from $7.4 million in the 2015 period, due to lower pre-stripping and
exploration costs incurred in the period, partly offset by higher mine and production costs
mentioned above.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, total cash costs at El Gallo 1 Mine were $445 per gold
equivalent ounce sold, compared to $414 per gold equivalent ounce in the same period in 2015.
The 7% increase in total cash costs on a per-ounce basis is due to lower average grades
obtained from ore mined and processed at El Gallo 1 Mine, which increased the production cost
of the ounces of gold equivalent sold in the period. On an aggregate basis, total cash costs
decreased by 2% to $13.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016, from $13.4 million in
the six months ended June 30, 2015.  Lower cash costs result from the 8% decrease in the
number of gold equivalent ounces sold during the period, offset by the overall higher production
cost obtained from the lower average grades noted above.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, all-in sustaining costs decreased by 11% to $517 per
gold equivalent ounce, compared to $584 per gold equivalent ounce in the same period in
2015.  On an aggregate basis, all-in sustaining costs decreased by 19%, to $15.4 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 from $18.9 million in the 2015 period.  The
29
Table of Contents
decrease is the result of lower pre-stripping and exploration costs incurred in the period, partly
offset by higher mine and production costs mentioned above.

(2)Total cash costs, all-in sustaining costs and average realized prices are non-GAAP financial
performance measures with no standardized definition under U.S. GAAP. See “Non-GAAP
Financial Performance Measures”, on page 35 for additional information, including definitions
of these terms.
Production
Gold production at the San José Mine for the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased by
10% to 25,209 ounces while silver production increased by 9% to 1,769,778 ounces, from 23,010
ounces of gold and 1,617,029 ounces of silver in the same period in 2015. Overall, this resulted
in a 10% increase in the number of gold equivalent ounces produced by MSC during the second
quarter.  The increase in production was the combined result of the 18% increase in the number
of tonnes of ore processed, partly offset by the 6% and 8% decrease in the average grade per
tonne of gold and silver, respectively.
For the six months ended June 30, 2015, gold production increased by 3% to 43,494 ounces
from 42,301 ounces while silver production increased by 7% to 3,131,654 from 2,931,836 ounces
in the same period in 2015, resulting in an overall 5% increase in the number of gold equivalent
ounces produced in the period. Higher production is associated with a stronger performance at
San Jose during 2016, which has not been affected by seasonal nor labour stoppages as it was
in the same period of 2015.
Sales
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, net sales increased by 17% to $58.6 million
compared to $49.9 million for the same period in 2015. The increase was a driven by the higher
average sale prices of gold and silver realized in the quarter, aligned with the higher price trend
observed in 2016, coupled with a slight increase in the number of ounces of gold and silver sold
in the period. In the second quarter of 2016, MSC sold 23,834 ounces of gold and 1,699,187
ounces of silver, compared to 23,446 ounces of gold and 1,676,015 ounces of silver in the same
period of 2015.
The average gross price for gold sold in the second quarter of 2016, after mark-to-market
provisional price adjustments, was 11% higher than in 2015, at $1,276 per ounce compared to
$1,152 per ounce received in the same period in 2015. In comparison, the average London
P.M. fix price for gold during the second quarter of 2016 was $1,260 per ounce, compared to
$1,193 per ounce for the same period in 2015.
The average gross price for silver sold in the second quarter of 2016, after mark-to-market
provisional price adjustments, was $18.09 per ounce, an increase of 18% compared to an
average of $15.33 per ounce received in the same period in 2015. In comparison, the average
London P.M. fix price for silver during the second quarter of 2016 was $16.78 per ounce,
compared to $16.41 per ounce for the same period in 2015.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, net sales realized by MSC from the sale of gold and
silver were 16% higher than in the comparable period in 2015, totaling $110.7 million compared
to $95.7 million. The increase is due to higher average realized gold and silver prices, as well as
the increase in the number of ounces of gold and silver sold during the period.  Gold and silver
ounces sold by MSC increased by 11% and 8% respectively, aligned with the overall increase in
production previously mentioned. Average price realized per ounce of and silver sold in the six
months ended June 30, 2015 increased by 8% and 4% respectively.
The difference between the average gross realized price per ounce of gold and silver sold by
MSC and the average London fix prices noted above is due to adjustments of certain
provisionally priced shipments of concentrates. Certain sales are ‘provisionally priced’ where the
selling price is subject to final adjustment at the end of a period, normally ranging from 15 to 90
days after the start of the delivery process to the customer, based on the market price at the
relevant quotation point stipulated in the contract. Sales revenue on provisionally priced sales of
concentrates is recognized based on estimates of the final pricing receivable, which in turn are
based on relevant forward market prices. At each reporting date, provisionally priced metal is
marked to market based on the forward selling price for the quotational period of the sales
contract.

Total Cash Costs and All-In Sustaining Costs
Total cash costs per gold equivalent ounce sold at the San José Mine for the quarter ended June
30, 2016 were $849 compared to $933 per gold equivalent ounce sold for the same period in
2015, based on a silver to gold ratio of 75:1 for both periods. On a co-product basis (gold and
silver), total cash cost for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 were $878 per ounce of gold and
$10.91 per ounce of silver, compared to $951 per ounce of gold and $12.19 per ounce of silver
for the same period in 2015.
The decrease in total cash costs is primarily a reflection of lower export duties in effect for 2016,
along with the decrease in on-site mining costs and refining and transportation costs during the
second quarter of 2016, partly offset by the lower average grades obtained per tonne of gold and
silver processed in the period. Overall, costs also decreased due to the devaluation of the
Argentinean Peso against the US dollar, which has offset the increase in inflation noted during
the period.
On an aggregate basis, total cash costs decreased year-over-year by 8%, from $42.7 million in
2015 to $39.5 million in 2016 despite the larger number of ounces of gold and silver sold in the
later period.  As mentioned above, the decrease is the result of lower production, refining and
transportation costs, coupled with lower export duties and the continuous devaluation of the
Argentinean peso noted during the quarter.
All-in sustaining cash costs for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 were $1,075 per gold equivalent
ounce compared to $1,215 per gold equivalent ounce in the same period in 2015, based on a
silver to gold ratio of 75:1 for both periods. On a co-product basis, all-in sustaining costs were
$1,112 per ounce of gold and $13.82 per ounce of silver, compared to $1,238 per ounce of gold
and $15.87 per ounce of silver for the same period in 2015.
The decrease in all-in sustaining costs for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was primarily
the result of a reduction in exploration costs, mine development and capital expenditures
incurred in 2016, which is also reflected in the 10% decrease from $55.6 million to $50.0 million
noted in all-in sustaining costs on an aggregate basis. All-in sustaining costs of gold and silver
decreased by 10% and 13% respectively, on a per ounce basis, due to a significantly higher
number of ounces sold over which the aggregate all-in sustaining cost is spread.
For the six months ended June 30, 2015, total cash costs per gold equivalent ounce were $806
compared to $912 based on a silver to gold ratio of 75:1. All-in sustaining costs were $1,006 per
gold equivalent ounce for the first half of 2015 compared to $1,175 in 2015 based on a silver to
gold ratio of 75:1. On a year-to-date basis, lower production costs also reflect the improved
performance at the San José Mine since no seasonal or labour stoppages have occurred in the
2016 period, compared to the 18 days stoppage that occurred in 2015.
Investment in MSC
The 49% attributable share of operations from our investment in MSC was net income of $4.1
million and $9.1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to net loss
of $2.7 million and $2.3 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. These
amounts are net of the amortization of the fair value increments arising from the purchase price
allocation and related income tax expense from Minera Andres’ acquisition in 2012. Included in
the income tax expense is the impact of fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Argentine
peso and the U.S. dollar on the peso-denominated deferred tax liability associated with the
investment in MSC recorded as part of the acquisition of Minera Andes. As a devaluation of the
Argentine peso relative to the U.S. dollar results in a recovery of deferred income taxes, the
impact has been an improvement in operations from our investment in MSC for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we received $2.8 million and $5.4 million
in dividends from MSC, respectively. In comparison, we received $0.5 million during the three
and six months ended June 30, 2015.
For more details on our Investment in MSC, refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, Investment in Minera Santa Cruz S.A. (“MSC”) — San José Mine.

Advanced-stage Properties
Advanced-stage properties consist of properties for which a feasibility study has been completed
indicating the presence of mineralized material, and that have obtained or are in the process of
obtaining the required permitting for construction and operation. Our designation of certain
properties as “Advanced-stage Properties” should not suggest that we have proven or probable
reserves at those properties as defined by the SEC Industry Guide 7.
As described under Critical Accounting Policies section contained in our annual report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, we define “Mine Development Costs” as the costs
incurred to design and construct mining and processing facilities, including engineering and
metallurgical studies, drilling, and other related costs to delineate an ore body, and the removal
of overburden to initially expose an ore body at open pit surface or underground mines.
Since no proven and probable reserves have been established on any of our properties except
for our 49% interest in the San José mine, mine development costs are not capitalized at any of
our properties, but rather are expensed as incurred, and allocated within “Mine Development
Costs” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).
Advanced-stage Properties – Nevada, U.S.
Gold Bar Project
We have targeted this project for an open pit, heap leach operation allowing for construction to
begin in 2017 and achieving production in 2018, dependent upon the completion of the
permitting process. For 2016, we have budgeted approximately $3.5 million, from which $1.2
million has been spent during the period ended June 30, 2016.
Mine permitting and engineering activities continue to advance at Gold Bar. The Environmental
Impact Statement (“EIS”) as well as critical mine design and engineering support are being
prepared by our employees in conjunction with our external consultants, as required.
Recent developments at Gold Bar include:
·Optimizing mine design, production schedule, and equipment needs;
·Updating capital and operating costs;
·Additional metallurgical work to optimize gold recoveries; and
·Detailed design of key process and related facilities.
In January 2016, we executed an agreement with NV Gold Corporation, an unaffiliated
corporation, to acquire the Afgan-Kobeh Project (“Afgan”), for $0.4 million. Afgan consists of 109
mining claims located in Nevada and is located approximately 3 miles (5 km) from the Gold Bar
Project. With Afgan’s close proximity to the anticipated Gold Bar processing facility and coupled
with the immediate resource expansion targets, this project represents an opportunity to extend
Gold Bar’s mine life at a low cost. In the second quarter ended June 30, 2016, we completed 12
drill holes on the eastward expansion of the deposit.  Additional work is being planned to further
test the southern limits of the known resource.
Advanced-stage Properties - El Gallo Complex, México
El Gallo 2 Project
For 2016, we have budgeted $1.5 million mainly to advance the project through performing a
feasibility study and conducting metallurgical work.  The majority of these costs are planned to be
incurred during the third and fourth quarters of the year.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of June 30, 2016, we had working capital of $47.6 million, comprised of current assets of
$64.7 million and current liabilities of $17.1 million. This represents an increase of approximately
$15.2 million or 47% from the working capital balance of $32.4 million as of December 31, 2015.
The improvement in our cash position was driven by cash generated from the strong performance
at our El Gallo 1 Mine in 2016, coupled with the $5.4 million dividend received from our
investment in MSC and cash generated from the exercise of stock options.  Cash inflows in the
period were partially offset by the acquisition of the royalty for the El Gallo 1 Mine and El Gallo 2
project and the return of capital paid during the six months ended June 30, 2016.    Overall, cash
increased by $10.9 million, or 42%, from December 31, 2015 to June 30, 2016. Comparatively,
from December 31, 2014 to June 30, 2015 cash increased by $10.0 million.
As at June 30, 2016, our current liabilities include accounts payable balance of $4.4 million
(2015 - $4.7 million) related to the registration taxes on intercompany financing agreements with
some of our subsidiaries, which is recorded in Argentinean peso and therefore has been reduced
as a result of the devaluation of the local currency against the U.S. dollar.  Furthermore, current
liabilities also include $2.5 million (2015 - $2.5 million) for reclamation accruals for mine closure
costs. Timing of payment of these obligations is yet to be determined and the obligations are
accordingly recorded as current liabilities. Current liabilities at December 31, 2015 also included
a $3.4 million short-term bank loan obtained by our subsidiary in Mexico during 2015, which was
fully repaid in January 2016 with the VAT receivable balances collected in Mexico.
We believe our working capital at June 30, 2016 is sufficient to fund ongoing operations,
development and corporate activities over the next 12 months. Our sources of working capital at
June 30, 2016 include cash flows from El Gallo 1 Mine, dividends received from MSC, cash on
hand, and other current assets.
If we make a positive production decision to develop either of our advanced-stage properties
Gold Bar or El Gallo 2, we will need to raise additional capital of approximately $60 million or
$150 million respectively (under existing estimates), given that the estimated capital cost of either
project significantly exceeds our available working capital. In either case, we would explore
several financing methods to complete the required development and construction stages, which
may include incurring debt, issuing additional equity, equipment leasing and other forms of
financing. Our ability to build either the Gold Bar or the El Gallo 2 projects is dependent on one or
several of the financing alternatives being completed.
Net cash provided by operations for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $19.6 million
compared to $6.0 million in the same period of 2015. The significant increase was mainly the
result of the collection of $9.5 million of VAT receivable in Mexico, and the $5.4 million dividend
received from our investment in MSC, partially offset by $3.2 million lower cash from sales
obtained from our El Gallo 1 Mine of $35.8 million compared to $39.0 million received in 2015.
Cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $5.2 million,
compared to $1.5 million in the same period of 2015.  The increase is due to the $6.0 million
acquisition of mineral property interest, including the acquisition of the royalty related to our El
Gallo 1 and El Gallo 2 properties, coupled with other acquisition of plant and equipment and
investments, which were partly offset by the reimbursement of a deposit received in the period, in
addition to the sale of some securities in 2016.  In comparison, during the same period of 2015
we had spent $1.1 million in the acquisition of certain available for sale securities.
Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $3.6 million,
compared to cash provided by financing activities of $5.8 million in the comparable period in
2015.  During the 2016 period, we fully repaid the short-term bank facility obtained by our
Mexican subsidiary, which was secured with the VAT receivable balances outstanding and
collected in the period.  We also repurchased shares of our stock in the amount of $0.6 million, in
line with the share repurchase plan approved by the Board in October 2015. Further, during the
six months ended June 30, 2016 we made the second semi-annual return of capital distribution
in the amount of $1.5 million and received $1.9 million from the exercise of stock options.
Whether future returns of capital distributions will be declared depends upon our future growth,
earnings and cash flow needs, of which there can be no assurance.

Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures
In this report, we have provided information prepared or calculated according to U.S. GAAP, as
well as provided some Non-U.S. GAAP (“Non-GAAP”) financial performance
measures.  Because the Non-GAAP performance measures do not have any standardized
meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP, they may not be comparable to similar measures presented
by other companies. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for
measures of performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There are material limitations
associated with the use of such Non-GAAP measures. Since these measures do not incorporate,
among other things, changes in working capital and non-operating cash costs, they are not
necessarily indicative of operating profit or loss, or cash flow from operations as determined in
accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Earnings from Mining Operations
The term Earnings from Mining Operations used in this report is a non-GAAP financial measure.
We use and report this measure because we believe it provides investors and analysts with a
useful measure of the underlying earnings from our mining operations.
We define Earnings from Mining Operations as Gold and Silver Revenues from our El Gallo 1
Mine and our 49% attributable share of the San José Mine’s Net Sales, less their respective
Production Costs Applicable to Sales. To the extent that Production Costs Applicable to Sales
may include depreciation and amortization expense related to the fair value increments on
historical business acquisitions (fair value paid in excess of the carrying value of the underlying
assets and liabilities assumed on the date of acquisition), we deduct this expense in order to
arrive at Production Costs Applicable to Sales that only include depreciation and amortization
expense incurred at the mine-site level. The San José Mine Net Sales and Production Costs
Applicable to Sales are presented, on a 100% basis, in Note 5 of the accompanying financial
statements.
The following table presents a reconciliation of Earnings from Mining Operations to Gross Profit,

Total Cash Costs, All-In Sustaining Costs and All-In Costs
The terms total cash costs, total cash cost per ounce, all-in sustaining costs, all-in sustaining cost
per ounce, all-in costs and all-in cost per ounce used in this report are non-GAAP financial
measures. We report these measures to provide additional information regarding operational
efficiencies both on a consolidated and an individual mine basis (San José
35
Table of Contents
Mine and El Gallo 1 Mine), and believe these measures provide investors and analysts with
useful information about our underlying costs of operations. For the San José Mine, where we
hold a 49% share in the production through our 49% interest in MSC, we exclude the share of
gold or silver production attributable to the controlling interest.
The measure total cash costs and total cash costs per ounce are calculated in accordance with
the Production Cost Standard developed by The Gold Institute, which was a worldwide
association of suppliers of gold and gold products and included leading North American gold
producers. The Gold Institute ceased operations in 2002, but we believe the standard is still the
accepted standard of reporting cash costs of production in North America. Adoption of the
standard is voluntary and the cost measures presented may not be comparable to other similarly
titled measures of other companies.
The measures all-in sustaining costs, all-in sustaining costs per ounce, all-in costs and all-in
costs per ounce were adopted in 2013, as we believe that these measures better represent the
total costs associated with producing gold.  We have adopted this reporting methodology based
on the standard from the World Gold Council (as promulgated in their June 27, 2013 press
release, World Gold Council’s Guidance Note on Non-GAAP Metrics — All-In Sustaining Costs
and All-In Costs). There is no assurance that these measures are necessarily comparable to our
industry peers.
Total cash costs consists of mining, processing, on-site general and administrative costs,
community and permitting costs related to current operations, royalty costs, refining and treatment
charges (for both doré and concentrate products), sales costs, export taxes and operational
stripping costs, but exclude depreciation and amortization. In order to arrive at our consolidated
total cash costs, we also include our attributable share of total cash costs from operations where
we hold less than a 100% economic share in the production, such as MSC where we hold a 49%
interest. The sum of these costs is divided by the corresponding gold equivalent ounces sold to
determine a per ounce amount.
All-in sustaining costs consists of total cash costs (as described above), plus environmental
rehabilitation costs and amortization of the asset retirement costs related to operating sites,
sustaining exploration and development costs, and sustaining capital expenditures. In order to
arrive at our consolidated all-in sustaining costs, we also include our attributable share of all-in
sustaining costs from operations where we hold less than a 100% economic share in the
production, as well as attributable corporate general and administrative expenses. The sum of
these costs is divided by the corresponding gold equivalent ounces sold to determine a per
ounce amount.
All-in costs include community, permitting and reclamation and remediation costs not related to
current operations, non-sustaining exploration and development costs and non-sustaining capital
expenditures. As these costs do not relate to any particular producing operation, we divide the
sum of these costs by the consolidated gold equivalent ounces sold, including our attributable
share of any operation where we hold less than a 100% interest, and do not provide this measure
on a per mine basis.
Costs excluded from total cash costs, sustaining all-in sustaining costs and all-in costs are
income tax expense, all financing charges, costs related to business combinations, asset
acquisitions and asset disposal.
For MSC, co-product total cash costs and all-in sustaining costs are calculated by dividing the
respective proportionate share of the total cash costs, all-in sustaining costs, and all-in costs for
each metal sold for the period by the ounces of each respective metal sold.  The respective
proportionate share of each metal sold is calculated based on their pro-rated sales
value.  Approximately 50% of the value of the sales in the second quarter of 2016 was derived
from gold and 50% was derived from silver.  This compares to 51% and 49% for gold and silver,
respectively, for the same period in 2015. For the six months ended June 30, 2016,
approximately 51% of the value of the sales was derived from gold and 49% from silver,
compared to 50% each for the comparable period in 2015.

The term average realized price per ounce used in this report is also a non-GAAP financial
measure. We report this measure to better understand the price realized in each reporting period
for gold and silver.
Average realized price is calculated as sales of gold and silver (excluding commercial
deductions) over the number of ounces sold in the period.
The following tables reconcile this non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable U.S.
GAAP measure, Gold and Silver Sales. Ounces of gold and silver sold for the San José Mine are
provided to us by MSC:

Gold equivalent ounces
The following table summarizes the consolidated number of gold equivalent ounces sold used to
calculate total cash costs, all-in sustaining costs, all-in costs, and average realized prices,
discussed above, on a per ounce basis. Gold equivalent ounces are calculated using an average
silver to gold ratio of 75:1, as determined in our 2016 budget. In 2015, the silver to gold ratio also
was 75:1.

Cash, investments and precious metals
The term cash, investments and precious metals used in this report is also a non‑GAAP financial
measure. We report this measure to better understand our liquidity in each reporting period.
Cash, investments and precious metals is calculated as the sum of cash, investments and
ounces of doré held in inventories with precious metals valued at the London PM Fix spot price
at the corresponding period.  The following table summarizes the calculation of cash,
investments and precious metals amounts shown in this report:

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of June 30, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as that phrase is
defined by SEC rules applicable to this report) which have or are reasonably likely to have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
Contingencies
We have surety bonds outstanding to provide bonding for our environmental reclamation
obligations in the United States.  These surety bonds are available for draw down in the event we
do not perform our reclamation obligations. When the specific reclamation requirements are met,
the beneficiary of the surety bonds will cancel and/or return the instrument to the issuing entity.
As of June 30, 2016, no liability has been recognized for our surety bonds of $4.9 million.
Critical Accounting Policies
Critical accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the financial statements are discussed
with our Audit Committee as they are implemented and on an annual basis.
There have been no significant changes in our Critical Accounting Policies since December 31,
2015.
Forward-Looking Statements
This report contains or incorporates by reference “forward-looking statements”, as that term is
used in federal securities laws, about our financial condition, results of operations and
business.  These statements include, among others:
·statements about our anticipated exploration results, cost and feasibility of production, receipt of
permits or other regulatory or government approvals and plans for the development of our
properties;
·statements concerning the benefits or outcomes that we expect will result from our business
activities and certain transactions that we contemplate or have completed, such as receipt of
proceeds, increased revenues, decreased expenses and avoided expenses and expenditures;
and
·other statements of our expectations, beliefs, future plans and strategies, anticipated
developments and other matters that are not historical facts.
These statements may be made expressly in this document or may be incorporated by reference
to other documents that we will file with the SEC.  You can find many of these statements by
looking for words such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates” or similar expressions
used in this report or incorporated by reference in this report.
Forward-looking statements and information are based upon a number of estimates and
assumptions that, while considered reasonable by management, are inherently subject to
significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, risks and contingencies, and there
can be no assurance that such statements and information will prove to be accurate. Therefore,
actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements
and information. We
40
Table of Contents
caution you not to put undue reliance on these statements, which speak only as of the date of this
report.  Further, the information contained in this document or incorporated herein by reference is
a statement of our present intention and is based on present facts and assumptions, and may
change at any time and without notice, based on changes in such facts or assumptions. Readers
should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.
Risk Factors Impacting Forward-Looking Statements
The important factors that could prevent us from achieving our stated goals and objectives
include, but are not limited to, those set forth in other reports we have filed with the SEC and the
following:
·our ability to raise funds required for the execution of our business strategy;
·our ability to secure permits or other regulatory and government approvals needed to operate,
develop or explore our mineral properties and projects;
·decisions of foreign countries and banks within those countries;
·unexpected changes in business, economic, and political conditions;
·results of MSC;
·fluctuations in interest rates, currency exchange rates, or commodity prices;
·timing and amount of mine production;
·our ability to retain and attract key personnel;
·technological changes in the mining industry;
·changes in operating, exploration or overhead costs;
·access and availability of materials, equipment, supplies, labor and supervision, power and
water;
·results of current and future exploration activities;
·results of pending and future feasibility studies or the expansion or commencement of mining
operations without feasibility studies having been completed;
·changes in our business strategy;
·interpretation of drill hole results and the geology, grade and continuity of mineralization;
·the uncertainty of reserve and resource estimates and timing of development expenditures;
·litigation or regulatory investigations and procedures affecting us;
·local and community impacts and issues including criminal activity and violent crimes;
·accidents, public health issues, and labor disputes;
·our continued listing on a public exchange;
·uncertainty relating to title to mineral properties; and
·changes in relationships with the local communities in the areas in which we operate.
We undertake no responsibility or obligation to update publicly these forward-looking statements,
except as required by law and may update these statements in the future in written or oral
statements.  Investors should take note of any future statements made by or on our behalf.
Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK
Our exposure to market risks includes, but is not limited to, the following risks: changes in foreign
currency exchange rates, changes in interest rates, equity price risks, commodity price
fluctuations and country risk. We do not use derivative financial instruments as part of an overall
strategy to manage market risk.
Further, our participation in the joint venture with Hochschild for the 49% interest held at MSC
creates additional risks because, among other things, we do not exercise decision making power
over the day-to-day activities at MSC; however, implications from our partner’s decisions may
result in us having to provide additional funding to MSC or in a decrease in our percentage of
ownership.
41
Table of Contents
Foreign Currency Risk
While we transact most of our business in U.S. dollars, some expenses, labor, operating supplies
and property and equipment are denominated in Canadian dollars, Mexican pesos or Argentine
pesos. As a result, currency exchange fluctuations may impact our operating costs. The
appreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies against the U.S. dollar increases costs and the cost of
purchasing property and equipment in U.S. dollar terms in Canada, Mexico and Argentina, which
can adversely impact our operating results and cash flows. Conversely, a depreciation of non-
U.S. dollar currencies usually decreases operating costs and property and equipment purchases
in U.S. dollar terms in foreign countries.
Since 2008, the Argentine peso has been steadily devaluing against the U.S. dollar by 10%-30%
on an annual basis.  In 2014 and 2015 the peso devalued by 28% and 35% respectively. During
the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Argentine peso devalued 15%.
Further, we are also subject to foreign currency risk on the fluctuation of the Mexican peso on our
VAT receivable balance. As of June 30, 2016, our VAT receivable balance was Mexican peso
45,406,570, equivalent to approximately $2.6 million, for which a 1% change in the Mexican peso
would have resulted in a gain/loss of $0.1 million in the Consolidated Statement of Operations
and Comprehensive Income (Loss).
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Mexican peso devalued 7% against the US
dollar.
The value of cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies also fluctuates with
changes in currency exchange rates. Appreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies results in a
foreign currency gain on such investments and a depreciation in non-U.S. dollar currencies
results in a loss. We have not utilized material market risk-sensitive instruments to manage our
exposure to foreign currency exchange rates but may in the future actively manage our exposure
to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We hold portions of our cash reserves in non-U.S. dollar
currencies. Based on our Canadian cash balance of $1.2 million (C$1.5 million) at June 30,
2016, a 1% change in the Canadian dollar would result in a gain/loss of $0.01 million in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).  We also hold
negligible portions of our cash reserves in Mexican and Argentine peso.
Equity Price Risk
We have in the past sought and will likely in the future seek to acquire additional funding by sale
of common stock.  Movements in the price of our common stock have been volatile in the past
and may also be volatile in the future. As a result, there is a risk that we may not be able to sell
common stock at an acceptable price to meet future funding requirements.
Commodity Price Risk
Changes in the price of gold and silver have in the past and could in the future significantly affect
our results of operations and cash flows.  We have in the past and may in the future hold a
portion of our treasury in gold and silver bullion, which is recorded at the lower of cost or
market.  Gold and silver prices may fluctuate widely from time to time.  Based on our revenues
from gold and silver sales of $35.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 (exclusive of
our investment in MSC), a 10% change in the spot price of gold and silver as of June 30, 2016
would have had an impact of approximately $3.6 million on our revenues.
Credit Risk
We may be exposed to credit loss through our precious metals and doré sales agreements with
Canadian financial institutions if these institutions are unable to make payment in accordance
with the terms of the agreements. However, based on the history and financial condition of our
counterparties, we do not anticipate any of the financial institutions to default on their obligation.
As of June 30, 2016,  we do not believe we have any significant credit exposure associated with
precious metals and our doré sales agreements.
42
Table of Contents
In Mexico, we are exposed to credit loss regarding our VAT taxes receivable if the Mexican tax
authorities are unable or unwilling to make payments in accordance with our monthly filings.
Timing of collection on VAT receivables is uncertain as VAT refund procedures require a
significant amount of information and follow-up. The risk is mitigated to the extent that the VAT
receivable balance can be applied against future income taxes payable. However, at this time we
are uncertain when, if ever, our Mexican operations will generate sufficient taxable operating
profits to offset this receivable against taxes payable. We continue to face risk on the collection of
our VAT receivables, which amount to $2.6 million as at June 30, 2016.
In Nevada, we are required to provide security to cover our projected reclamation costs. As at
June 30, 2016, we have surety bonds of $4.9 million in place to satisfy bonding requirements for
this purpose. Although we do not believe we have any significant credit exposure associated
with these bonds, we are exposed to credit loss regarding our deposit if the surety bond
underwriter defaults on its coverage of the bond. There is also the risk the surety bonds may no
longer be accepted by the governmental agencies as satisfactory reclamation coverage, in which
case we would be required to replace the surety bonding with cash.
Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
(a)We maintain a system of controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (“Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within time
periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  As of June 30,
2016, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, management has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
(b)Changes in Internal Controls.  There were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 that materially affected or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
