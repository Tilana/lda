Solicitors: Chaudhary & Associates for the Plaintiff

RULING
BACKGROUND

[1].    
On the 9th of July 2007, Apisai Vusonitokalau ("Apisai") - the plaintiff, was walking along Tabua Place in Ba when he was hit by a car. The registration number of that car was CY591. It was being driven by Sofina Morren Begum ("Begum") - the 2nd defendant. It is alleged that Begum was a servant/agent of New World Limited ("New World") at the time of the accident. Hence, New World is also being sued in this case. Apisai's statement of claim alleges negligence against Begum. The particulars of negligence are set out in the statement of claim.

[2].    
Begum was charged for careless driving and on 31st of May 2007, she was convicted as charged under sections 99 (1) and 114 of the Land Transport Act 1988. She was also convicted on one count of driving a motor vehicle without a driver's licence. 

[3].    
Begum was fined $150-oo (one hundred and fifty dollars). She has since paid her fine at the LTA office. Apisai's claim relies on that conviction on the issue of negligence.

[4].    
Apisai suffered severe personal injuries as a result of the accident. The particulars of these are set out in the statement of claim:

Particulars of Injuries

Admitted to Lautoka Hospital
His right leg was deformed painful and difficult to move.

INVESTIGATIONS

Radiological x-rays revealed fracture of the right tibia and fibula.

TREATMENT

Pain relief
Manipulation under Anasesthesia
Long leg cast
Physiotherapy
Walking with crutches
He was discharged on 13th July 2007 and was subsequently reviewed in the orthopedic clinic.
He was last reviewed on 13th August 2008 and was noted to be still walking with crutches.

[5].    
The defendants have never bothered to file a statement of defence. And so  on 7th of August 2009, default judgment was entered against them both. That was followed immediately by the filing of notice of assessment of damages on the 12th of August 2009. These  according to two affidavits of service of Rajesh Muni Ratnam, a registered bailiff  have both been served on New World and Begum. 

[6].    
Thereafter, the matter was called before me on the 7th of September 2009 when Mr. Suresh Maharaj appeared for Sahu Khan & Sahu Khan for the defendants. On Mr. Maharaj's application, the defendants were given 21 days to set aside the default judgment. 

[7].    
There were to be several call overs of this matter with counsel appearing and informing the court that parties were talking settlement. However, when no settlement happened, I finally set the case down for hearing on assessment of damages to the 17th of May 2010. That hearing did not proceed. After some more adjournments - the hearing finally took place on the 24th of August 2010. 

EVIDENCE

[8].    
Apisai gave the following evidence on oath.

after the accident, Apisai found that both leg bones were broken. He was taken to Ba Mission Hospital. From there, he was then than transported to Lautoka Hospital where he was admitted.

I can't walk. Will have to used to crutches. His date of birth is 09/10/45. He will be 65 years of age this year (i.e. 2010).

at the time of the accident, he worked at R.C. Manubhai as watchman for 3 nights a week and was paid $58. 

(xi)    
when weather gets bad, he could feel pain in the leg. When it gets cold, he feels pain. He felt pain right now in the court room because of the air conditioning.

(xii)   
his right leg is shorter then left leg.

(xiii)  
after the discharge from Lautoka Hospital, he had to make trips to Lautoka Hospital for therapy. 6 trips from Ba to Lautoka - $240 by van. He doesn't have receipts.

(xiv)   
he spent $100 for pain relief medicine. He still takes panadol for pain relief. He spends $40 per month on these i.e. $10 per week.

(xv)

[9].    
Dr. Joeli Mareko also gave evidence. He is a Consultant Orthopedic Surgeon at Lautoka Hospital. He came to court with Apisai's hospital folder and read from a Medical Report on Apisai that he had prepared in March 2009. 

[10].   
According to Dr. Mareko, when Apisai arrived at hospital, his right leg was deformed and not in proper position. An x-ray revealed that Apisai had a fracture of the bone in the right leg. It was a simple fracture. Apisai was given pathedene narcotics and manipulation under anesthesia. 

[11].   
Dr. Mareko tried to put the bones in place and then he put a cast around Apisai's right leg. He prescribed physiotherapy for Apisai and also ordered a pair of crutches. 

[12].   
Apisai's right leg has shortened since the accident. This is because the bone of the right leg is not healing in proper position. Because of the shortness of the right leg, Apisai will now have to walk with a gait. Also, he will feel extra weight on the shorter leg. He would have problems in kneeling, running, walking up steps and even sitting in toilet pits. He assesses Apisai's incapacity at 10% to 15%. He said that Apisai would need pain killer in the future to manage his pain.
