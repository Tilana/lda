</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that, in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted in June 1993 
</p>
<p>by the World Conference on Human Rights (A/CONF.157/24), the World Conference 
</p>
<p>encouraged the Commission on Human Rights to continue the examination of optional protocols 
</p>
<p>to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> <i>also</i> that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the 2005 World 
</p>
<p>Summit Outcome and General Assembly resolution 60/251 establishing the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council all affirm that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interrelated, interdependent and 
</p>
<p>mutually reinforcing and must be treated in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and 
</p>
<p>with the same emphasis,  
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> previous resolutions of the Council and the Commission on Human Rights 
</p>
<p>on the realization of economic, social and cultural rights, and in particular Council resolution 1/3 
</p>
<p>on the Open-ended Working Group on an optional protocol to the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,  
</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming</i> the report of the Working Group (A/HRC/8/7) and the decision to transmit the 
</p>
<p>draft optional protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to 
</p>
<p>the Council for its consideration,

</p>
<p>resolution 60/251, adopt the following draft resolution: </p>

<p>2 
 
</p>
<p> &#8220;<i>The General Assembly</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> the adoption by the Human Rights Council, through its resolution ..., of the Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p> 1<i>. Adopts</i> and opens for signature, ratification and accession the Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the text of which is annexed to the present 
</p>
<p>resolution; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Recommends</i> that the Optional Protocol be opened for signature at a signing ceremony in

</p>
<p><b>Annex  
</b></p>
<p><b>OPTIONAL PROTOCOL TO THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT  
ON ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>Preamble 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The States Parties to the present Protocol</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Considering</i> that, in accordance with the principles proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p>recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family 
</p>
<p>is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting</i> that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims that all human beings are born free 
</p>
<p>and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth therein, 
</p>
<p>without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, 
</p>
<p>national or social origin, property, birth or other status, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenants on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can only be 
</p>
<p>achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy civil, cultural, economic, political and social 
</p>
<p>rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of all human rights 
</p>
<p>and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that each State Party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
</p>
<p>(hereinafter referred to as the Covenant) undertakes to take steps, individually and through international 
</p>
<p>assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum of its available resources, 
</p>
<p>with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the Covenant by all 
</p>
<p>appropriate means, including particularly the adoption of legislative measures, </p>

<p>     3 
 
</p>
<p> <i>Considering</i> that, in order further to achieve the purposes of the Covenant and the implementation of 
</p>
<p>its provisions, it would be appropriate to enable the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
</p>
<p>(hereinafter referred to as the Committee) to carry out the functions provided for in the present Protocol, 
</p>
<p> <i>Have agreed</i> as follows: 
</p>
<p><b>Article 1 
</b></p>
<p><b>Competence of the Committee to receive and consider communications 
</b></p>
<p>1. A State Party to the Covenant that becomes a Party to the present Protocol recognizes the competence 
</p>
<p>of the Committee to receive and consider communications as provided for by the provisions of the present 
</p>
<p>Protocol. 
</p>
<p>2. No communication shall be received by the Committee if it concerns a State Party to the Covenant 
</p>
<p>which is not a Party to the present Protocol. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 2 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communications 
</b></p>
<p> Communications may be submitted by or on behalf of individuals or groups of individuals, under the 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction of a State Party, claiming to be victims of a violation of any of the economic, social and cultural 
</p>
<p>rights set forth in the Covenant by that State Party. Where a communication is submitted on behalf of 
</p>
<p>individuals or groups of individuals, this shall be with their consent unless the author can justify acting on 
</p>
<p>their behalf without such consent.  
</p>
<p><b>Article 3 
</b></p>
<p><b>Admissibility 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Committee shall not consider a communication unless it has ascertained that all available 
</p>
<p>domestic remedies have been exhausted. This shall not be the rule where the application of such remedies is 
</p>
<p>unreasonably prolonged. 
</p>
<p>2. The Committee shall declare a communication inadmissible when: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) It is not submitted within one year after the exhaustion of domestic remedies, except in cases 
</p>
<p>where the author can demonstrate that it had not been possible to submit the communication within that time 
</p>
<p>limit; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The facts that are the subject of the communication occurred prior to the entry into force of the 
</p>
<p>present Protocol for the State Party concerned unless those facts continued after that date; </p>

<p>4 
 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The same matter has already been examined by the Committee or has been or is being 
</p>
<p>examined under another procedure of international investigation or settlement; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) It is incompatible with the provisions of the Covenant; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) It is manifestly ill-founded, not sufficiently substantiated or exclusively based on reports 
</p>
<p>disseminated by mass media; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) It is an abuse of the right to submit a communication; or when 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) It is anonymous or not in writing. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 4 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communications not revealing a clear disadvantage 
</b></p>
<p> The Committee may, if necessary, decline to consider a communication where it does not reveal that 
</p>
<p>the author has suffered a clear disadvantage, unless the Committee considers that the communication raises a 
</p>
<p>serious issue of general importance. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 5 
</b></p>
<p><b>Interim measures 
</b></p>
<p>1. At any time after the receipt of a communication and before a determination on the merits has been 
</p>
<p>reached, the Committee may transmit to the State Party concerned for its urgent consideration a request that 
</p>
<p>the State Party take such interim measures as may be necessary in exceptional circumstances to avoid 
</p>
<p>possible irreparable damage to the victim or victims of the alleged violations. 
</p>
<p>2. Where the Committee exercises its discretion under paragraph 1 of the present article, this does not 
</p>
<p>imply a determination on admissibility or on the merits of the communication. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 6 
</b></p>
<p><b>Transmission of the communication 
</b></p>
<p>1. Unless the Committee considers a communication inadmissible without reference to the State Party 
</p>
<p>concerned, the Committee shall bring any communication submitted to it under the present Protocol 
</p>
<p>confidentially to the attention of the State Party concerned. 
</p>
<p>2. Within six months, the receiving State Party shall submit to the Committee written explanations or 
</p>
<p>statements clarifying the matter and the remedy, if any, that may have been provided by that State Party. </p>

<p>     5 
 
</p>
<p><b>Article 7 
</b></p>
<p><b>Friendly settlement 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Committee shall make available its good offices to the parties concerned with a view to reaching 
</p>
<p>a friendly settlement of the matter on the basis of the respect for the obligations set forth in the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>2. An agreement on a friendly settlement closes consideration of the communication under the present 
</p>
<p>Protocol. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 8 
</b></p>
<p><b>Examination of communications 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Committee shall examine communications received under article 2 of the present Protocol in the 
</p>
<p>light of all documentation submitted to it, provided that this documentation is transmitted to the parties 
</p>
<p>concerned. 
</p>
<p>2. The Committee shall hold closed meetings when examining communications under the present 
</p>
<p>Protocol. 
</p>
<p>3. When examining a communication under the present Protocol, the Committee may consult, as 
</p>
<p>appropriate, relevant documentation emanating from other United Nations bodies, specialized agencies, 
</p>
<p>funds, programmes and mechanisms, and other international organizations, including from regional human 
</p>
<p>rights systems, and any observations or comments by the State Party concerned. 
</p>
<p>4. When examining communications under the present Protocol, the Committee shall consider the 
</p>
<p>reasonableness of the steps taken by the State Party in accordance with Part II of the Covenant. In doing so, 
</p>
<p>the Committee shall bear in mind that the State Party may adopt a range of possible policy measures for the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the rights set forth in the Covenant. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 9 
</b></p>
<p><b>Follow-up to the views of the Committee 
</b></p>
<p>1. After examining a communication, the Committee shall transmit its views on the communication, 
</p>
<p>together with its recommendations, if any, to the parties concerned. 
</p>
<p>2. The State Party shall give due consideration to the views of the Committee, together with its 
</p>
<p>recommendations, if any, and shall submit to the Committee, within six months, a written response, including 
</p>
<p>information on any action taken in the light of the views and recommendations of the Committee. 
</p>
<p>3.  The Committee may invite the State Party to submit further information about any measures the State 
</p>
<p>Party has taken in response to its views or recommendations, if any, including as deemed appropriate by the 
</p>
<p>Committee, in the State Party&#8217;s subsequent reports under articles 16 and 17 of the Covenant. </p>

<p>6 
 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>1. A State Party to the present Protocol may at any time declare under this article that it recognizes the 
</p>
<p>competence of the Committee to receive and consider communications to the effect that a State Party claims 
</p>
<p>that another State Party is not fulfilling its obligations under the Covenant. Communications under this article 
</p>
<p>may be received and considered only if submitted by a State Party that has made a declaration recognizing in 
</p>
<p>regard to itself the competence of the Committee. No communication shall be received by the Committee if it 
</p>
<p>concerns a State Party which has not made such a declaration. Communications received under this article 
</p>
<p>shall be dealt with in accordance with the following procedure: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) If a State Party to the present Protocol considers that another State Party is not fulfilling its 
</p>
<p>obligations under the Covenant, it may, by written communication, bring the matter to the attention of that 
</p>
<p>State Party. The State Party may also inform the Committee of the matter. Within three months after the 
</p>
<p>receipt of the communication the receiving State shall afford the State that sent the communication an 
</p>
<p>explanation, or any other statement in writing clarifying the matter which should include, to the extent 
</p>
<p>possible and pertinent, reference to domestic procedures and remedies taken, pending or available in the 
</p>
<p>matter; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) If the matter is not settled to the satisfaction of both States Parties concerned within six months 
</p>
<p>after the receipt by the receiving State of the initial communication, either State shall have the right to refer 
</p>
<p>the matter to the Committee, by notice given to the Committee and to the other State; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The Committee shall deal with a matter referred to it only after it has ascertained that all 
</p>
<p>available domestic remedies have been invoked and exhausted in the matter. This shall not be the rule where 
</p>
<p>the application of the remedies is unreasonably prolonged; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (<i>c</i>) of the present paragraph the Committee shall 
</p>
<p>make available its good offices to the States Parties concerned with a view to a friendly solution of the matter 
</p>
<p>on the basis of the respect for the obligations set forth in the Covenant;  
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) The Committee shall hold closed meetings when examining communications under the present 
</p>
<p>article;  
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) In any matter referred to it in accordance with subparagraph (<i>b</i>) of the present paragraph, the

</p>
<p>information; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) The States Parties concerned, referred to in subparagraph (<i>b</i>) of the present paragraph, shall 
</p>
<p>have the right to be represented when the matter is being considered by the Committee and to make 
</p>
<p>submissions orally and/or in writing;  </p>

<p>     7 
 
</p>
<p> (<i>h</i>) The Committee shall, with all due expediency after the date of receipt of notice under 
</p>
<p>subparagraph (<i>b</i>) of the present paragraph, submit a report, as follows: 
</p>
<p>(i) If a solution within the terms of subparagraph (<i>d</i>) of the present paragraph is 
</p>
<p>reached, the Committee shall confine its report to a brief statement of the facts and of 
</p>
<p>the solution reached; 
</p>
<p>(ii) If a solution within the terms of subparagraph (<i>d</i>) is not reached, the Committee shall, in 
</p>
<p>its report, set forth the relevant facts concerning the issue between the States Parties 
</p>
<p>concerned. The written submissions and record of the oral submissions made by the 
</p>
<p>States Parties concerned shall be attached to the report. The Committee may also 
</p>
<p>communicate only to the States Parties concerned any views that it may consider 
</p>
<p>relevant to the issue between them. 
</p>
<p>In every matter, the report shall be communicated to the States Parties concerned. 
</p>
<p>2. A declaration under paragraph 1 of the present article shall be deposited by the States Parties with the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General of the United Nations, who shall transmit copies thereof to the other States Parties. A 
</p>

</p>
<p>not prejudice the consideration of any matter that is the subject of a communication already transmitted under 
</p>
<p>the present article; no further communication by any State Party shall be received under the present article 
</p>
<p>after the notification of withdrawal of the declaration has been received by the Secretary-General, unless the

</b></p>
<p>1. A State Party to the present Protocol may at any time declare that it recognizes the competence of the

</p>
<p>Party of any of the economic, social and cultural rights set forth in the Covenant, the Committee shall invite 
</p>
<p>that State Party to cooperate in the examination of the information and to this end to submit observations with 
</p>
<p>regard to the information concerned. 
</p>
<p>3. Taking into account any observations that may have been submitted by the State Party concerned as

<p>members to conduct an inquiry and to report urgently to the Committee. Where warranted and with the 
</p>
<p>consent of the State Party, the inquiry may include a visit to its territory.

</p>
<p>2. The Committee may, if necessary, after the end of the period of six months referred to in article 11,

</p>
<p>inquiry.

</p>
<p>or assistance, along with the State Party&#8217;s observations and suggestions, if any, on these views or

</p>
<p>2. The Committee may also bring to the attention of such bodies, with the consent of the State Party 
</p>
<p>concerned, any matter arising out of communications considered under the present Protocol which may assist </p>

<p>     9 
 
</p>
