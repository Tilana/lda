<p><b>REPORT OF THE FOURTEENTH MEETING OF SPECIAL RAPPORTEURS/ 
REPRESENTATIVES, INDEPENDENT EXPERTS AND CHAIRPERSONS OF 
WORKING GROUPS OF THE SPECIAL PROCEDURES OF THE HUMAN

<p><b>(GENEVA, 18-22 JUNE 2007) 
Rapporteur: Vernor Mu&#241;oz Villalobos 
</b></p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The fourteenth annual meeting of special procedures was held in Geneva from 
18 to 22 June 2007. During the meeting, mandate-holders had exchanges of views with the 
High Commissioner, the Deputy High Commissioner, the former President of the Human Rights 
Council and the facilitator of the Working Group of the Council on the universal periodic review 
(UPR) mechanism. Participants also met with representatives of non-governmental organizations 
and national human rights institutions, and held a joint meeting with participants in the 
nineteenth meeting of persons chairing human rights treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p> Participants elected Gay McDougall Chairperson of the fourteenth annual meeting and of 
the Coordination Committee. Vernor Mu&#241;oz Villalobos was elected Rapporteur of the meeting 
and member of the Coordination Committee. Yakin Ert&#252;rk, Okechukwu Ibeanu and Miloon 
Kothari were elected members of the Committee. The former Chairperson, Vitit Muntarbhorn, is 
an ex-officio member. 
</p>
<p> Participants focused their discussions on the outcome of the institution-building process of 
the Human Rights Council. They welcomed the improvements to the human rights system 
brought about by the institution-building process, in particular the UPR mechanism. Concerning 
UPR, the importance of the participation of civil society and human rights mechanisms in the 
process was described as crucial for its effectiveness. 
</p>
<p> The desirability of engaging actively in the implementation of the Code of Conduct 
adopted by the Council in its resolution 5/2 was highlighted by many. Participants in the annual 
meeting decided to request the Coordination Committee to draft and present at its fifteenth 
meeting an appropriate procedure by which the Code of Conduct and other relevant documents, 
including the Manual, could be best implemented. They also decided that, in the meantime, the 
Committee would give appropriate consideration to any matter concerning the working methods 
of mandate-holders brought to its attention (see annex II). 
</p>
<p> When discussing the draft revised Manual for Special Procedures mandate-holders, 
participants decided to ask a number of mandate-holders, through the Committee, to look into 
comments received from stakeholders, as well as into the implications of the Code of Conduct, 
and to revise the Manual accordingly. It was agreed that the Manual would reflect some of the 
issues discussed during the meeting, including issues related to the cooperation of special 
procedures with regional human rights mechanisms, non-governmental organizations and 
national human rights institutions. 
</p>
<p> When discussing approaches to thematic and country situations, participants stressed the 
need to strengthen coordination between geographic and thematic mandates. The need to look at </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>complementarities within the entire system, including treaty bodies and country engagement 
strategies of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), 
was mentioned. 
</p>
<p> Participants discussed cooperation with regional mechanisms, including good practices. It 
was suggested that representatives of key regional mechanisms should be invited to participate in 
future annual meetings, and that ways to ensure more regular mandate-holder participation in 
meetings of regional organizations should be explored. Enhanced institutional arrangements for 
the exchange of information between regional organizations and OHCHR were considered 
necessary. 
</p>
<p> Participants also discussed their engagement with United Nations country teams,<b> </b>including 
how special procedures could better influence the programming process and the national 
development process. It was stressed how UPR implied a new collective responsibility for the 
United Nations system in the field of human rights. Participants welcomed the efforts of 
OHCHR to ensure enhanced integration of their work into country analysis and programming. It 
was stressed that training and awareness-raising of country teams were essential in order to 
achieve enhanced synergies. The need to think about ways to strengthen follow-up by country 
teams to special procedures recommendations was highlighted. 
</p>
<p> During the joint meeting with chairpersons of treaty bodies, participants exchanged views 
on UPR. Participants stressed that it could offer a political forum to follow up their work. The 
challenge was to see to what extent special procedures and treaty bodies should tailor their 
activities in order to have an impact on the UPR process. Participants also addressed the issue of 
non-cooperation with the UPR system, and the ways and means through which this could be 
addressed. 
</p>
<p> In the discussion with representatives of non-governmental organizations and national 
human rights institutions, the need for the Coordination Committee to take a greater role in 
coordination of country visits and joint statements was indicated. The desirability for the 
Committee to conduct an annual dialogue with the Council was highlighted. Other issues raised 
included increased focus on follow-up; more regular representation of mandate-holders in 
meetings of regional organizations; joint missions; closer attention to discrimination and 
violence on grounds of gender identity; the situation of people living in extreme poverty; 
translation of reports into local languages; and enhancing the website. </p>

</p>
<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. Annual meetings of special rapporteurs/representatives, experts and chairpersons of 
working groups of the special procedures of the Commission on Human Rights and the Human 
Rights Council have been organized since 1994. The Vienna Declaration and Programme of 
Action adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993 underlined the 
importance of preserving and strengthening the system of special procedures and specified that 
the procedures and mechanisms should be enabled to harmonize and rationalize their work 
through periodic meetings.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>2. The fourteenth annual meeting of special procedures was held in Geneva from 18 
to 22 June 2007. It had before it a provisional annotated agenda and a series of documents 
prepared by mandate-holders, the Secretariat and other sources. 
</p>
<p>3. A list of the special procedures of the Council and mandate-holders attending the 
fourteenth annual meeting is contained in annex I. 
</p>
<p>4. During the meeting, mandate-holders had exchanges of views with the 
High Commissioner, the Deputy High Commissioner, the former President of the Council and 
the facilitator of the Working Group of the Council on the universal periodic review (UPR) 
mechanism. Participants also met with representatives of non-governmental organizations and 
national human rights institutions, and held a joint meeting with participants in the 
nineteenth meeting of persons chairing human rights treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  ORGANIZATION OF WORK 
</b></p>
<p>5. The meeting was opened by Vitit Muntarbhorn, the Chairperson of the thirteenth annual 
meeting and Chairperson of the Coordination Committee of Special Procedures. 
</p>
<p>6. Participants elected Gay McDougall Chairperson of the fourteenth annual meeting and of 
the Coordination Committee. Vernor Mu&#241;oz Villalobos was elected Rapporteur of the meeting 
and member of the Committee. Yakin Ert&#252;rk, Okechukwu Ibeanu and Miloon Kothari were 
elected members of the Committee. The former Chairperson, Vitit Muntarbhorn, is an ex-officio 
member. 
</p>
<p>7. Participants expressed their appreciation for the process of nominations that had been 
undertaken by e-mail by the outgoing Chairperson and called for even earlier and broader 
consultations to be undertaken in 2008. 
</p>
<p>8. Meeting participants expressed their deep appreciation for the impressive work carried out 
throughout the year by the outgoing Chairperson and the other members of the Coordination 
Committee, in particular in connection with the review of mandates process of the Council. 
Participants also thanked the Special Procedures Branch for its support to the Committee and for 
keeping mandate-holders informed about Council developments throughout the year. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  A/CONF.157/24 (Part II), para. 95. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>9. The agenda was approved by participants. The planned exchange of views with the new 
President of the Council could not be held because the Council was in session. The Chairperson 
of the meeting was asked to address an organizational session of the Council on 22 June. In her 
statement, she referred to the institution-building process and the role that special procedures 
were ready to play in the new framework, including in connection with the selection procedure 
for mandate-holders and the review of mandates process, UPR and the Human Rights Council 
Advisory Committee. 
</p>
<p>10. A number of issues were identified that should be given adequate time for discussion 
during the fifteenth annual meeting. They included exchanges of views with regional human 
rights mechanisms and representatives of other United Nations agencies and programmes; 
briefing on new human rights instruments, such as the rights of persons with disabilities; 
cooperation with national human rights institutions; and discussions on issues of special concern. 
</p>
<p>11. A number of parallel events were organized outside the formal agenda of the meeting. 
Several mandate-holders attended those events.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p><b>III.  ACTIVITIES OF THE COORDINATION COMMITTEE 
</b></p>
<p>12. The outgoing Chairperson, Vitit Muntarbhorn, briefed participants on the activities of the 
Coordination Committee under his chairmanship. 
</p>
<p>13. The first thread of activities of the Committee was related to interaction with the Human 
Rights Council and other stakeholders with regard to the institution-building process. The aim 
was to ensure that the review of mandates would result in a more effective and strengthened 
system of special procedures. 
</p>
<p>14. The Chairperson of the Committee had delivered two statements on behalf of the special 
procedures mandate-holders at the first and second sessions of the Council. At the second and 
fourth sessions of the Council, the Committee held meetings with the President, the facilitators 
of the institution-building working groups of the Council and the coordinators of regional and 
other groups. The Chairperson gave a public briefing<b> </b>on<b> </b>29 March 2007 in Geneva. At the final 
session of the Working Group on the Review of Mandates, in April 2007, the Chairperson of the 
Committee again held meetings with the President of the Council and other stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>15. The second thread of activities was related to facilitating cooperation among 
mandate-holders. The Committee held two meetings, in Geneva and New York, and telephone 
conferences approximately every six weeks. Mandate-holders were consulted by e-mail, 
telephone and other means on various occasions, with a view to facilitating cooperation and a 
common response to issues that arose during the year. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  The events included discussions on human rights impact of corporate activity; the Convention 
</p>
<p>on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol; possibilities of cooperation 
between special procedure mandate-holders and national human rights institutions; security and 
travel procedures; and the RWI/UNU book project on special procedures. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>16. The third thread of activities referred to interaction with civil society. Throughout the year, 
the Committee received comments and inputs and engaged in fruitful discussions with several 
non-governmental organizations on issues of common interest, including the institution-building 
process. 
</p>
<p>17. The outgoing Chairperson outlined a number of challenges which the participants in the 
annual meeting and the new Committee would have to address, such as issues arising from the 
institution-building process, including implementation of the Code of Conduct; the revision and 
finalization of the special procedures manual; the facilitation of an increasing number of joint 
activities; the analysis of protection gaps; and the definition of the role and functions of the 
Coordination Committee in the new framework. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  INSTITUTION-BUILDING PROCESS 
</b></p>
<p>18. Participants had an opportunity to meet with the High Commissioner, the Deputy 
High Commissioner, the former President of the Human Rights Council and the former 
facilitator of the Working Group of the Council on UPR to discuss issues arising from the 
institution-building process. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Exchange with the Deputy High Commissioner 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Deputy High Commissioner conveyed her appreciation to all participants for their 
work and stated that the interactive dialogues that she had attended at the fourth and 
fifth sessions of the Council demonstrated the deep commitment of mandate-holders to the 
protection and promotion of human rights. 
</p>
<p>20. The Deputy High Commissioner welcomed the increasing cooperation among 
mandate-holders and referred to some of the joint activities by special procedures in the past 
year, including the work of the expert group on Darfur, mandated by the Council. She also stated 
that she had followed with great interest the participation of mandate-holders, including through 
the Coordination Committee, in the institution-building process, and had appreciated their 
important contribution to discussions. She encouraged participants to focus their discussions on 
the way forward and on how to continue to strengthen and improve the special procedures 
system for more effective protection of human rights. She stressed that the Code of Conduct 
could be a tool to build greater trust with stakeholders and strengthen the system. 
</p>
<p>21. The Deputy High Commissioner reiterated that she intended to maintain a constant 
dialogue with special procedures. 
</p>
<p>22. The desirability of foreseeing an in-depth discussion on how special procedures might need 
to adjust their methods of work as the Council evolved was raised. 
</p><p>23. The Deputy High Commissioner noted the appreciation expressed for the work of OHCHR 
and reassured mandate-holders that OHCHR would do its best to efficiently respond to 
remaining administrative challenges. 
</p>
<p>24. Participants discussed the agreement on institution-building reached by the Council, 
including the Code of Conduct for special procedures. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>25. Participants welcomed the improvements to the human rights system which were brought 
about by the institution-building process, in particular the UPR mechanism. Concerning UPR, 
the importance of the participation of civil society and human rights mechanisms in the process 
was indicated as crucial for its effectiveness. 
</p>
<p>26. The desirability of engaging actively in the implementation of the Code of Conduct 
adopted by the Council in its resolution 5/2 was highlighted by many. Participants in the annual 
meeting decided to request the Coordination Committee to draft and present at its 
fifteenth meeting an appropriate procedure by which the Code of Conduct and other relevant 
documents, including the Manual, could be best implemented. Participants also decided that, in 
the meantime, the Coordination Committee should give appropriate consideration to any matter 
concerning the working methods of mandate-holders that may be brought to its attention (see 
annex II). 
</p>
<p>27. Questions were raised about the possible implications of the new selection procedure. The 
need to clarify the issue of the conflict of interest which would make candidates ineligible was 
mentioned. The fact that the consultative group should take into account the views of current and 
outgoing mandate-holders was indicated as offering an important entry point. In this connection, 
a call was made to mandate-holders to proactively engage in this area. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Exchange with the former President of the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>28. The former President of the Human Rights Council, Ambassador Luis Alfonso de Alba, 
briefed participants on the main aspects of the institution-building process. He recalled how 
difficult the consensus-building effort had been and expressed satisfaction at the final outcome of 
the exercise. He stressed that new selection procedures foreseeing the endorsement by the 
Council would add legitimacy and credibility to the work of the procedures. The former 
President further indicated that information from special procedures would constitute an 
important background for UPR. 
</p>
<p>29. The former President highlighted how the process of formulation of the Code of Conduct 
had been different from the negotiations on the President&#8217;s text adopted in resolution 5/1. 
Referring to discussions that had been held in the context of negotiations of the Code of 
Conduct, he advised the special procedures to play an active role in ensuring appropriate 
implementation. 
</p>
<p>30. The former President warmly thanked mandate-holders for their input to the 
institution-building process, which had been extremely valuable. Many mandate-holders 
welcomed the role played by the former President in helping the Council shape the 
institution-building process in a way that resulted in a strengthened system of protection and 
promotion of human rights. 
</p>
<p>31. Questions were raised about how to ensure a meaningful Council debate on UPR. The 
former President underlined that the composition of the delegation participating in the Working 
Group on the UPR mechanism would be important in that respect, and that ideally this should 
ensure human rights expertise. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>32. Questions were also raised concerning the procedure of selection of mandate-holders and 
the interpretation of the issue of the conflict of interest as criteria for ineligibility. Many 
participants echoed the need for mandate-holders themselves to establish a mechanism that 
would look into issues of accountability. The view was expressed that the ongoing review of 
mandates should use as a basis the framework of the mandates as they have evolved over the 
years in the Commission on Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>33. It was noted that country mandates had been maintained. Consensus showed that unilateral 
naming and shaming was not productive. At the same time, the door was left open for 
constructive discussions on country issues. 
</p>
<p>34. The former President indicated that contribution to UPR, the involvement of special 
procedures in the implementation of the Code of Conduct, and the need to build on synergies and 
avoid duplication were priority areas on which mandate-holders could focus their attention. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Exchange with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>35. The High Commissioner expressed satisfaction at the final result of the institution-building 
process. UPR was a landmark achievement that would allow the Council to move towards the 
implementation phase. The High Commissioner stressed the important role that special 
procedures had played in the institution-building process and encouraged them to remain 
engaged in future related discussions. The High Commissioner also invited mandate-holders to 
reflect on future interactions with the new Advisory Committee. The High Commissioner 
furthermore welcomed the fact that the meeting was looking into the need to increase 
cooperation with United Nations country teams. Finally, the High Commissioner reiterated the 
great value that she attached to the work of special procedures and to their cooperation, which 
facilitated her work. 
</p>
<p>36. Participants thanked the High Commissioner for the central role she played in the 
institution-building process. Participants agreed that the challenge ahead was to be creative in 
envisaging how the special procedures system would evolve in the new framework and in 
relation to UPR. 
</p>
<p>37. The role of special procedures in the selection process as set out in Council resolution 5/1 
on institution-building was welcomed. Mechanisms to ensure consultations in this regard were 
encouraged. 
</p>
<p>38. There was agreement that joint activities mandated by the Council as a follow-up to 
resolutions allowed for closer integration of special procedures into the broader work of the 
Council. The importance of an inclusive approach or methodology in shaping the tasks assigned 
to special procedures was highlighted. 
</p>
<p>39. Participants asked OHCHR to provide for institutional cooperation with regional human 
rights mechanisms. Participants also discussed the support received by OHCHR field presences 
during country visits. Reflection on the role of special procedures in the broader context of the 
United Nations system for enhanced implementation of human rights was desirable. With regard 
to country strategies, it was highlighted that it was important to maintain the independence of 
each component of the system while ensuring complementarity. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>V.  WORKING METHODS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Draft revised Manual of Special Procedures Mandate-Holders 
</b></p>
<p>40. The need to look into the relationship between the Code of Conduct and the Manual of 
Special Procedures was mentioned by a number of participants. Article 2 (b) of the Code of 
Conduct stated that the provisions of the Manual of the United Nations Human Rights Special 
Procedures should be in consonance with those in the Code. The Secretariat informed 
participants that several contributions had been received by stakeholders before the deadline for 
comments set by the Coordination Committee. 
</p>
<p>41. Participants decided to ask a number of mandate-holders, through the Coordination 
Committee, to look into the comments and the implications of the Code of Conduct, and to 
revise the Manual accordingly. The following mandate-holders would be involved in the 
exercise: Ghanim Alnajjar,<b> </b>Philip Alston, Vitit Muntarbhorn, Manfred Nowak and 
Leila Zerrougui. 
</p>
<p>42. It was agreed that the Manual would reflect some of the issues discussed during the 
meeting, including issues related to the cooperation of special procedures with regional 
human rights mechanisms, non-governmental organizations and national human rights 
institutions. 
</p>
<p><b>B. Consultancy study on enlarging the network of civil society actors working 
with special procedures and strengthening collaboration among 
mandate-holders, the Special Procedures Branch and civil society 
</b></p>
<p>43. The main conclusions of a consultancy study on enlarging the network of civil society 
actors working with special procedures and strengthening collaboration among special 
procedures mandate-holders, OHCHR and civil society actors were presented to participants. 
The study was prepared using information contained in OHCHR databases and through informal 
consultations with civil society actors and OHCHR staff members, recording good practices of 
cooperation to be replicated. 
</p>
<p>44. The study showed that 90 per cent of mandates had some form of interaction or 
relationship with national civil society actors. Almost 70 per cent of special procedures 
interacted with victims, 70 per cent with academics, 65 per cent with professional associations, 
60 per cent with human rights defenders and 45 per cent with representatives of religious groups. 
The study also provided data on the geographic distribution of civil society contacts. The 
different types of interaction held by mandate-holders with civil society actors were also 
addressed in the report. 
</p>
<p>45. The recommendations of the study also addressed interaction with civil society as a source 
of information. There was a need to ensure enhanced information of sources on communication 
procedures, as well as involvement in follow-up strategies. Recommendations also dealt with 
ways and means to increase awareness about special procedures among civil society actors; 
enlarge the network of civil society contacts, in particular in the African and Arab regions; 
facilitate access to special procedures; and ensure institutional memory. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>46. Several mandate-holders highlighted the crucial role that civil society actors play in the 
effective functioning of the special procedures system. The need to ensure that special 
procedures have a broad network of partners, including United Nations country teams and 
OHCHR country and regional presences, was highlighted. 
</p>
<p>47. An important aspect of the work of civil society was its support in disseminating the work 
of special procedures, including through translation of their reports in local languages to 
facilitate follow-up to recommendations. 
</p>
<p>48. There was a need to include grass-roots national non-governmental organizations in the 
consultations carried out by mandate-holders with civil society actors. The need to make the 
website more accessible through translation into other official languages than English was 
highlighted.  
</p>
<p>49. It was pointed out that it would be of assistance if reports could be disseminated to relevant 
national civil society actors after country visits. Country visits by special procedures represented 
an opportunity to create platforms for dialogue between civil society actors and the Governments 
concerned and also an opportunity for the United Nations system on the ground to familiarize 
national actors with the special procedures system. Contacts and exchanges of information 
between non-governmental organizations working on similar issues in different countries and 
regions should also be further facilitated. 
</p>
<p>50. The education and awareness-raising role that special procedures play vis-&#224;-vis civil 
society was mentioned. It was stressed that not only country visit reports but also relevant 
thematic reports should be disseminated at the country level. The need to ensure a broad 
interpretation of the definition of civil society actors to include groups such as the press and 
sports associations was also indicated.  
</p>
<p>51. Questions were raised on existing avenues for non-governmental organizations to receive 
funding from OHCHR. The secretariat informed participants on the Acting Community Together 
project. To a varying extent, the Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture, the Voluntary Fund for 
Indigenous Populations and the Voluntary Trust Fund on Contemporary Forms of Slavery all 
provided grants to allow civil society actors to participate in relevant thematic sessions and 
events.  
</p>
<p><b>VI.  PROTECTION GAPS AND OVERLAPS 
</b></p>
<p>52. Philip Alston and Manfred Nowak presented a preliminary non-paper on behalf of the 
Coordination Committee, drafted after consultations with all mandate-holders. The non-paper 
was prepared in the light of the institution-building process and the review of mandates exercise 
and was not aimed at setting out a new comprehensive architecture of mandates but rather 
analysing the existing system.  
</p>
<p>53. In the draft non-paper, the authors examined whether there were any issues that reflected 
significant violations of human rights and were not already either the subject of a particular 
thematic or sectoral mandate, or effectively covered in practice by one of those mandates. The 
authors stressed that concerns about overlap or duplication of issues among different mandates 
were overstated. There was inevitably an adjustment mechanism which helped to ensure that the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>same issues were rarely, if ever, approached from the same perspective by two different 
mandates. In addition, there was considerable complementarity and reinforcement when it 
proved possible for two mandates to address issues related to one another. In conclusion, the 
authors suggested that it would be productive to focus on the procedure to be adopted in future in 
responding to specific suggestions about protection gaps.  
</p>
<p>54. Participants stressed that Council resolution 5/1 contained an indication of criteria which 
would guide any future review.<b>3</b> In view of that fact, several participants expressed the opinion 
that the paper should represent the basis for an in-depth discussion and wide consultations and be 
revised, taking into account the suggestions made by several mandate-holders in their reports, 
issues raised during the discussions, comments received by other stakeholders, and existing 
practices whereby several mandates already covered, to a varying extent, issues identified as 
gaps or emerging issues. A common position on the future process of the review of mandates 
was also needed. This should include a discussion on how to address egregious violations of 
human rights in a specific country. A reflection on whether to favour a holistic approach when 
addressing related issues was considered desirable. The Coordination Committee would take the 
process forward and revise the paper. 
</p>
<p><b>VII.  EXCHANGE OF EXPERIENCE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Country and thematic approaches 
</b></p>
<p>55. Several issues concerning country and thematic approaches were mentioned by participants 
as deserving particular attention and reflection. There was a need to strengthen coordination 
between geographic and thematic mandates. In particular, the role of thematic mandate-holders 
was of crucial importance in cases where the specific country mandate was not allowed to visit 
the country for an extended period of time or where a country mandate had been discontinued. It 
was reiterated that no initiatives by thematic mandate-holders in a country covered by a country 
mandate-holder should be undertaken without consultation with the latter, in accordance with 
existing practice.  
</p>
<p>56. When devising strategies to address the human rights situation in countries that did not 
cooperate with special procedures, the need to look at complementarities with the entire system, 
including treaty bodies and United Nations country presences, as well as OHCHR country 
engagement strategies, was mentioned.  
</p>
<p>57. The need for thematic mandate-holders and geographic mandate-holders to mutually 
consult so as to ensure consistency in strategies and approaches was emphasized. In general, 
some participants called for a mechanism or practice to ensure that outgoing mandate-holders 
would have an opportunity to brief incoming ones on their country and thematic approaches.  
</p>
<p>58.  The need to think as a group about how best to address country situations in which there 
were gross and systematic violations of human rights was indicated. One participant referred to 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  Report to the General Assembly on the fifth session of the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/5/21), para. 58. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the experience of the expert group on Darfur and noted that, in the future, mandate-holders might 
be increasingly assigned the task of looking into specific situations. A common reflection on this 
issue was desirable.   
</p>
<p>59. Participants noted the adoption by the General Assembly on 13 December 2006 of the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities<b>4</b> and encouraged all special procedures to 
give appropriate attention within their mandates to the special challenges persons with 
disabilities face in the enjoyment of their human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Cooperation with regional mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
indigenous people, Rodolfo Stavenhagen, introduced a paper on cooperation with regional 
human rights mechanisms. Regional human rights mechanisms relevant to the work of special 
procedures included the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights, affiliated with the Organization of American States and which 
include several thematic rapporteurs; the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights of 
the African Union and its system of thematic special mechanisms; the Council of Europe treaty 
bodies, including the European Court of Human Rights and the European Committee for the 
Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the European 
Committee of Social Rights and the Advisory Committee of the Framework Convention on the 
Protection of National Minorities, and other specialized mechanisms, particularly the Human 
Rights Commissioner of the Council of Europe; the High Commissioner on National Minorities, 
the Representative on Freedom of the Media, and the Special Representative and Coordinator for 
Combating Trafficking in Human Beings of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (OSCE); and the Working Party on Human Rights and other European Union expert 
bodies. 
</p>
<p>61. Many of the above-mentioned mechanisms covered areas that were similar or closely 
related to special procedures mandates, in a context of limited resources and human rights abuses 
that demanded common efforts. 
</p>
<p>62. In recent years, special procedures had increased their cooperation with different regional 
human rights mechanisms in their respective areas of expertise, with very encouraging results. 
Participation in expert workshops and exchange of information on relevant activities, exchange 
of views on substantive issues and working methods, and collaborative action in relation to 
specific situations were some of the ways in which cooperation with regional mechanisms had 
taken place, and they had become routine activities for many mandate-holders. Some recent 
examples were mentioned.<b>5</b>  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  General Assembly resolution 61/106. 
</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  Recent experiences in this regard included the activities of the independent expert on minority 
</p>
<p>issues in cooperation with the Inter-American Commission&#8217;s special rapporteur on persons of 
African descent and against racial discrimination, and the interaction between the Representative 
of the Secretary-General on internally displaced persons and his counterpart at the African 
 </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>63. By their very nature, regional organizations had direct contact with regional and country 
realities and trends, and provided different conceptual approaches to the protection of human 
rights. The authoritative information they produced was hence extremely useful for special 
procedures reporting activities, and also for the development of strategies and areas deserving 
priority attention.  
</p>
<p>64. Mandate-holders had also strengthened cooperation with regional human rights bodies in 
relation to country visits. Country and thematic reports elaborated by these bodies, as well as 
their recommendations concerning specific countries or cases, were routinely used in the 
preparation of missions by mandate-holders. 
</p>
<p>65. A more direct form of cooperation had been seen in the assistance in the preparation and 
conduct of special procedures visits by regional bodies with a presence in the field. More 
recently, there had been attempts to strengthen cooperation with regional bodies through the joint 
missions with similar procedures of regional bodies.  
</p>
<p>66. While the special procedures communications procedure was unique in its flexibility and 
universality, regional human rights systems included a number of similar procedures. There had 
been limited capacity to cooperate with regional human rights mechanisms regarding specific 
instances of human rights violations. Limited resources available for the special procedures work 
and their sizeable workload, linked to the established effectiveness of many of these regional 
mechanisms, justified a reflection in order to better select grounds for intervention and prevent 
potential overlaps. One way to advance in that direction would be the development of closer 
working relations between OHCHR and the secretariats of those regional mechanisms. There 
was also a need to look into strengthening cooperation with regional treaty bodies.  
</p>
<p>67. Several proposals were made by participants to increase and strengthen cooperation with 
regional bodies. It was decided that some of their suggestions should be included in the relevant 
part of the Manual.  
</p>
<p>68. It was suggested that representatives of key regional mechanisms should be invited to 
participate in future annual meetings. Similarly, ways to ensure more regular participation of 
mandate-holders in meetings of regional organizations should be explored. OHCHR was 
requested to systematically analyse reports and other information emanating from regional 
</p>
<p>     
</p>
<p>Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. Similarly, the Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment had an established record of 
cooperation with relevant bodies and secretariats at the European level, including the OSCE 
Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights and the Council of Europe Committee on 
Legal Affairs and Human Rights, the Commissioner for Human Rights, and, as a matter of 
course, the Committee for the Prevention of Torture. He has also participated in several meetings 
of the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights in relation to issues related to his 
mandate. In 2005, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
indigenous people participated in a plenary session of the African Commission in Banjul, where 
he had the opportunity to liaise with the Commission&#8217;s working group on indigenous 
populations/communities.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>organizations and to include relevant issues in the country assessments prepared prior to 
missions. Mandate-holders were called on to visit regional organizations and encourage them to 
integrate special procedures findings in their programming. Enhanced institutional arrangements 
for the exchange of information between regional organizations and OHCHR were considered 
necessary. It was stressed that referring to the information and jurisprudence of regional 
organizations in special procedures reports made them more solid. It was also desirable to 
involve regional organizations in efforts to gather material and information for the preparation of 
thematic reports.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  System-wide coherence and engagement with United Nations country teams 
</b></p>
<p>69. OHCHR presented a paper on engagement with United Nations country teams. Reference 
was made to a statement of common understanding on a human rights-based approach to 
development programming as a tool to provide guidance on how to operationalize the human 
rights-based approach in the context of United Nations common programming processes at the 
country or regional levels, including the common country assessment and United Nations 
Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF).   
</p>
<p>70. The statement could be summarized in three reference points: all programmes of 
development cooperation, policies and technical assistance should further the realization of 
human rights as stipulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international 
human rights instruments; human rights standards and principles guided all development 
cooperation and programming in all sectors and phases of the programming process; and 
development cooperation contributed to the development of the capacities of duty-bearers to 
meet their obligations and/or of rights-holders to claim their rights. 
</p>
<p>71. OHCHR recalled that the former Secretary-General had commissioned a high-level panel 
to formulate recommendations on United Nations system-wide coherence. The panel made 
recommendations that were to be discussed by the General Assembly, recommending increased 
coherence at the country level and strengthened links between normative and operational work. 
The United Nations was now working on the concept of one United Nations system at the 
country level. This implied strengthened responsibility of the Resident Coordinator and the 
existence of a single United Nations programme with a coherent funding structure. It would also 
imply common United Nations premises in the field. United Nations country teams in Albania, 
Cape Verde, Mozambique, Pakistan, Rwanda, the United Republic of Tanzania, Uruguay and 
Viet Nam were piloting that concept.  
</p>
<p>72. It was essential to reflect on the linkages between the work of country teams and the work 
of human rights mechanisms, including special procedures. OHCHR had been supporting that 
process by assisting in the development of a common language and in strengthening capacities.  
</p>
<p>73. The discussion revolved around how the United Nations country teams could capitalize on 
the work of special procedures, particularly their country missions, and how special procedures 
could influence the programming process and the national development process. It was stressed 
that UPR implied a new collective responsibility for the United Nations system in the field of 
human rights.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>74. OHCHR reported on the work under way to build capacities to ensure that, in accordance 
with existing mandatory guidelines, human rights was an integral part of the analysis of country 
situations. This included training on human rights-based analysis in the context of the common 
country assessment and UNDAF processes and the launching of country web pages to better 
promote the use of recommendations by special procedures in these processes. 
</p>
<p>75. OHCHR had organized meetings with Resident Coordinators to discuss the advantages of a 
human rights-based approach. The Office was also increasingly involved in the selection of 
Resident Coordinators. 
</p>
<p>76. OHCHR furthermore informed participants that, for five weeks, there had been an 
electronic discussion on the electronic knowledge network HuRiTALK, and several 
recommendations had been made by United Nations colleagues working on development issues 
concerning cooperation with special procedures. One general recommendation was that the work 
of special procedures should pay more attention to the conceptual framework, which was the 
basis of the human rights-based approach. To strengthen dialogue between special procedures 
and United Nations country teams, there were suggestions that special procedures should, on an 
informal ad hoc basis, support specific country processes, in particular in the formulation of the 
common country assessment, UNDAF and poverty reduction strategies. A number of good 
practices had been identified.  
</p>
<p>77. Participants welcomed efforts by OHCHR to ensure enhanced integration of their work 
into country analysis and programming. Participants reported on very good experiences of 
cooperation with and support from some United Nations country teams. However, the situation 
varied in different countries, and in some cases there was a poor understanding of the role of 
special procedures and/or a lack of willingness to engage with them. It was stressed that training 
and awareness-raising of country teams were essential in order to achieve enhanced synergies.  
</p>
<p>78. It was essential to think of ways to strengthen follow-up by United Nations country teams 
to special procedures recommendations. Positive examples were mentioned of visits of special 
procedure mandate-holders, which had facilitated synergies between different actors and 
promoted the creation of platforms to follow up on their recommendations. In some cases, 
mandate-holders were specifically called upon to comment on projects and other documents 
produced by country teams. The desirability of improved feedback from country teams on 
follow-up was underlined. In order to ensure that the momentum generated by a country visit 
would not be lost, the importance of country visit reports being issued on time was stressed.   
</p>
<p>79. Participants recommended that the possibility of inviting United Nations agencies and 
programmes and Bretton Woods institutions to participate in future annual meetings be explored. 
It was also decided that the background papers prepared for the meeting would be updated and 
good practices collected. 
</p>
<p><b>VIII.  COOPERATION WITH TREATY BODIES 
</b></p>
<p>80. Participants had an opportunity to meet with the chairpersons of treaty bodies. The 
exchange of views focused on UPR.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>81. Ambassador Mohammed Loulichki, facilitator of the Working Group of the Council on the 
universal periodic review addressed the meeting. He recalled the historical background and 
rationale behind the genesis of UPR, stressing the need to avoid selectivity and treat all countries 
on the same footing. He stressed that UPR would not replace but complement the work of treaty 
bodies and special procedures. The major issues discussed in the process of negotiations were 
related to the meeting. The facilitators reported on the phases of the review and the sources of 
information that would be used.  
</p>
<p>82. Participants stressed that UPR would offer a political forum to follow up their work. The 
challenge was to see to what extent special procedures and treaty bodies should tailor their 
activities so that they had an impact on the UPR process.  
</p>
<p>83. One participant stressed how press reports on the institution-building process had been 
negligible and how UPR would be enhanced if the media took more notice of it. 
Non-governmental organizations had an important role to play in that regard. 
</p>
<p>84. The inclusion of the reference to gender perspectives in Council resolution 5/1 on 
institution-building among the principles to guide the work of the Council and to inform UPR 
was welcomed by participants. The need for better integration of gender perspectives into the 
work of all special procedures and treaty bodies was indicated. 
</p>
<p>85. The meeting also addressed the issue of non-cooperation with the UPR system. Ways and 
means through which this could be addressed were mentioned, including resolutions and special 
sessions. 
</p>
<p><b> IX. CONSULTATIONS WITH NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS 
 AND NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS INSTITUTIONS 
</b></p>
<p>86. Participants had an open discussion with representatives of non-governmental 
organizations and national human rights institutions, and stressed how much they valued 
interaction with those bodies. 
</p>
<p>87. Appreciation was expressed by civil society organizations for the professionalism and 
effectiveness with which the Coordination Committee and other mandate-holders had 
participated in the institution-building process. Reference was made to the global petition 
organized by 17 regional and international non-governmental organizations, which had attracted 
more than 14,000 signatures.  
</p>
<p>88. Several civil society representatives welcomed the consideration given by the meeting to 
the establishment of an appropriate procedure by which the Code of Conduct and other relevant 
documents, including the Manual of the United Nations Human Rights Special Procedures could 
be best implemented. 
</p>
<p>89. The need for the Coordination Committee to take a greater role in coordination of country 
visits and joint statements was indicated. The desirability for the Coordination Committee to 
conduct an annual dialogue with the Council was also highlighted.  
</p>
<p>90. Other issues raised included the need to increase the focus on follow-up, including the 
need for non-governmental organizations to provide feedback on communications; more regular </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>representation of mandate-holders in meetings of regional organizations; joint missions; closer 
attention to discrimination and violence on the grounds of gender identity; the situation of people 
living in extreme poverty; the importance of ensuring translation of reports into local languages; 
and enhancing the website. 
</p>
<p>91. National human rights institutions expressed their satisfaction at the fact that, for the first 
time, they had been invited to participate in an exchange with the special procedures together 
with non-governmental organizations. They referred to a background paper that had been 
prepared for the meeting detailing areas for cooperation between special procedures and national 
human rights institutions and requested that it be endorsed. </p>
