The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Progress Energy Trust and all the information in this
annual report are the responsibility of management and have been approved by the Trust’s Board of Directors.
The financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.  When  alternative  accounting  methods  exist, management  has  chosen  those  it  deems  most
appropriate in the circumstances. Financial statements are not precise since they include certain amounts
based on estimates and judgments. Management has determined such amounts on a reasonable basis in
order to ensure that the financial statements are presented fairly, in all material respects. Management has
prepared the financial information presented elsewhere in the annual report and has ensured that it is consistent
with that in the financial statements.
Progress Energy Trust maintains appropriate systems of internal accounting and administrative controls of
high quality. These systems are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial information is
relevant, reliable  and  accurate  and  that  the  Trust’s  assets  are  properly  accounted  for  and  adequately
safeguarded.
The Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring that Management fulfills its responsibilities for financial
reporting and is ultimately responsible for reviewing and approving the financial statements. The Board carries
out this responsibility principally through its Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, composed entirely of independent directors, meets regularly
with Management, as well as the external auditors, to discuss auditing (external, internal and joint venture),
internal  controls, accounting  policy  and  financial  reporting  matters.  The  committee  reviews  the  financial
statements  and  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  and  recommends  their  approval  to  the  Board  of
Directors.  The  Committee  also  considers, for  review  by  the  board  and  approval  by  the  unitholders, the
engagement or re-appointment of the external auditors.
The financial statements have been audited by KPMG LLP, the external auditors, in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards on behalf of the unitholders. KPMG LLP has full and free access to the Audit
Committee.

To the Unitholders of Progress Energy Trust
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Progress Energy Trust as at December 31, 2005 and
2004 and the consolidated statements of earnings and deficit and cash flows for the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2004. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Trust’s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards
require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatements. An audit includes examining on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.
In our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Trust as at December 31, 2005 and 2004 and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting
principles.

(tabular amounts are in $ thousands except for trust units and per trust unit amounts)
Progress Energy Trust (“Progress” or the “Trust”) is an open-ended, unincorporated investment trust governed
by the laws of the province of Alberta. The principal undertaking of the Trust is to indirectly explore for, develop
and hold interests in petroleum and natural gas properties through investments in securities of subsidiaries
and royalty interests in petroleum and natural gas properties. Progress Energy Ltd. carries on the business
of the Trust and directly owns the petroleum and natural gas properties and assets related thereto. The Trust
owns, directly and indirectly, 100 percent of the common shares (excluding the exchangeable shares – see
notes 1 and 8) of Progress Energy Ltd. The activities of Progress Energy Ltd. are financed through interest
bearing notes from the Trust and third party debt. The convertible debentures are direct obligations of the
Trust. Under the Trust Indenture, the Trust may declare payable to unitholders all or any part of the income
of the Trust, which is primarily comprised of interest earned on debt notes issued to Progress Energy Ltd.,
as well as, amounts attributed to a net profits interest (“NPI”) agreement entered into with Progress Energy
Ltd. The aggregate amounts received by the Trust each period are based on the consolidated cash flow from
operations before changes in non-cash working capital each period, as adjusted on a discretionary basis, for
cash withheld to fund capital expenditures.
Pursuant to the terms of the NPI agreement, the Trust is entitled to a payment from Progress Energy Ltd.
each month equal to the amount by which 99% of the gross proceeds from the sale of production exceed
99%  of  certain  deductible  expenditures  (as  defined).  Under  the  terms  of  the  NPI  agreement, deductible
expenditures may include amounts, determined on a discretionary basis, to fund capital expenditures, to repay
third party debt and to provide for working capital required to carry out the operations of Progress Energy Ltd.
The Trust was established as part of a Plan of Arrangement (the “Arrangement”) that became effective on
July 2, 2004. The Arrangement gave effect to the transaction contemplated by the agreement entered into
on May 28, 2004 by Progress Energy Ltd. and Cequel Energy Inc. (“Cequel”). The reorganization resulted in
the shareholders of Progress Energy Ltd. and Cequel receiving trust units or exchangeable shares in the Trust,
a new energy trust that owns approximately 90 percent of the combined assets of Progress Energy Ltd. and
Cequel. In addition, the shareholders of Progress Energy Ltd. and Cequel received shares in two separate,
publicly-listed, exploration-focused companies, ProEx Energy Ltd. (“ProEx”) and Cyries Energy Inc. (“Cyries”).
The remaining properties were transferred to ProEx and Cyries, respectively, consisting of certain prospective
natural gas weighted assets and undeveloped land.
Pursuant to the Arrangement, shareholders of both Progress Energy Ltd. and Cequel received shares of both
ProEx and Cyries and at their election, either units of the Trust or exchangeable shares which may be exchanged
into units of the Trust. The Arrangement resulted in Progress Energy Ltd. shareholders receiving one trust
unit or one exchangeable share of the Trust and 0.2 of a share in each of ProEx and Cyries. Cequel shareholders
received 0.695 trust units or exchangeable shares of the Trust and 0.139 of a share in each of ProEx and
Cyries.
Upon completion of the Arrangement, 65.4 million trust units and 16.0 million exchangeable shares were
outstanding.
The conversion of Progress Energy Ltd. to a Trust has been accounted for as a continuity of interest. Accordingly,
the consolidated financial statements reflect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows as
if the Trust had always carried on the business formerly carried on by Progress Energy Ltd. The year ended
December 31, 2004 reflect the results of operations and cash flows of Progress Energy Ltd. and its subsidiaries
for the period January 1 to July 1, 2004 and the results of operations and cash flows of the Trust and its
subsidiary for the period July 2 to December 31, 2004. Due to the conversion into an energy trust, certain
information included in the financial statements for prior periods may not be directly comparable.
Relationship with ProEx
In conjunction with the Arrangement, the Trust entered into a Technical Services Agreement with ProEx where
the  Trust  provides  personnel  and  certain  administrative  and  technical  services  in  connection  with  the
management, development, exploitation and operation of the assets of ProEx and the marketing of its production.
The Technical Services Agreement has no set termination date and will continue until terminated by either
party with one year prior written notice to the other party or some other date as mutually agreed. As contemplated
in the Arrangement, ProEx has granted performance shares to the employees of Progress as service providers.
The Trust provides these services to ProEx on an expense reimbursement basis, based on ProEx’s monthly
capital activity and production levels relative to the combined capital activity and production levels of both
the  Trust  and  ProEx.  Total  expense  reimbursed  by  ProEx  for  the  year  ended  December  31, 2005  was 
$2.8 million (2004 – $0.6 million).
As a result of the Arrangement the Trust and ProEx have joint interest in certain properties and undeveloped
land. These joint interest properties are governed by standard industry agreements and in addition the Trust
has entered into a Protocol Arrangement with ProEx that specifies how each company will manage the joint
lands in specifically identified areas of interest. The Protocol Arrangement identifies methods and processes
to be followed on both existing and new lands, joint facilities, marketing, seismic and surface rights. To ensure
good governance practices, both the Trust and ProEx have each created independent committees of their Board
of Directors to monitor compliance with the Technical Services Agreement and the Protocol Arrangement.
As at December 31, 2005, accounts payable included $1.8 million (2004 – $4.1 million) payable to ProEx
which includes standard joint venture amounts including revenue. These amounts were paid subsequent to
year end. In July 2004, the Trust sold ProEx $3.1 million of assets it purchased earlier in 2004, in contemplation
of the formation of ProEx. The assets primarily consisted of undeveloped land.
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation
The Trust is involved in the exploration, development and production of petroleum and natural gas in British
Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan. The consolidated financial statements are stated in Canadian dollars
and have been prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Trust and its wholly owned subsidiary.
Joint Operations
Substantially all of the exploration, development and production activities are conducted jointly with others
and accordingly, the Trust only reflects its proportionate interest in such activities.
Measurement Uncertainty
The amounts recorded for depletion and depreciation of petroleum and natural gas property, plant and equipment
and the asset retirement obligations and related accretion are based on estimates. The cost recovery ceiling
test is based on estimates of proved reserves, production rates, petroleum and natural gas prices, future
costs and other relevant assumptions. By their nature, these estimates are subject to measurement uncertainty
and the effect on the financial statements of changes in such estimates in future periods could be material.

Cash and Short-Term Investments
Cash and short-term investments consist of cash in the bank, less outstanding cheques and short-term deposits
with a maturity of less than three months.
Petroleum and Natural Gas Properties
The Trust uses the full cost method of accounting for petroleum and natural gas properties under which all
costs  related  to  the  acquisition, exploration  and  development  of  petroleum  and  natural  gas  reserves  are
capitalized. Such costs include lease acquisition costs, geological and geophysical costs, carrying charges
of non-producing properties, costs of drilling both productive and non-productive wells, the cost of petroleum
and natural gas production equipment and overhead charges related to exploration and development activities.
In accordance with the full cost accounting guideline, the Trust evaluates its oil and gas assets to determine
that the costs are recoverable and do not exceed the fair value of the properties. The costs are assessed
to be recoverable if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected from the production of proved reserves
and the lower of cost and market of unproved properties exceed the carrying value of the oil and gas assets.
If  the  carrying  value  of  the  oil  and  gas  assets  is  not  assessed  to  be  recoverable, an  impairment  loss  is
recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the sum of the discounted cash flows expected from
the production of proved and probable reserves and the lower of cost and market of unproved properties.
The cash flows are estimated using the future product prices and costs and are discounted using the risk-
free rate.
Proceeds from the disposition of petroleum and natural gas properties are applied against capitalized costs
except for dispositions that would change the rate of depletion and depreciation by 20% or more, in which
case a gain or loss would be recorded.
Depletion and Depreciation
Capitalized costs, together with estimated future capital costs associated with proven reserves, are depleted
and depreciated using the unit-of-production method based on estimated proved reserves of petroleum and
natural gas as determined by independent engineers. For purposes of this calculation, reserves and production
are converted to equivalent units of oil based on relative energy content of six thousand cubic feet of gas to
one barrel of oil. Costs of significant unproved properties, net of impairments, are excluded from the depletion
and depreciation calculation.
Other assets, which is comprised of office equipment and furniture and fixtures, are recorded at cost and are
depreciated over their useful life on a declining balance basis at 20%.
Asset Retirement Obligations
The Trust records a liability for the fair value of future asset retirement obligations in the period in which they
are incurred, normally when the asset is purchased or developed. On recognition of the liability there is a
corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related asset within property, plant and equipment, which
is depleted on a unit-of-production basis over the life of the reserves. Estimates used are evaluated on a
periodic basis and any adjustments are applied prospectively. The liability is adjusted each reporting period
to reflect the passage of time, with the accretion charged to earnings. Actual costs incurred upon settlement
of the obligations are charged against the liability. No gains or losses on retirement activities were realized
due to settlements approximating the estimates.
Goodwill
Goodwill is recognized on corporate acquisitions when the total purchase price exceeds the fair value of the
net identifiable assets of the acquired company. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the
fourth quarter. If indications of impairment are present, a loss would be charged to earnings for the amount
that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value.
Financial Instruments
The Trust uses derivative financial instruments from time to time to hedge its exposure to commodity price
and foreign exchange fluctuations. The Trust may enter into crude oil and natural gas swap contracts, options
or collars to hedge its exposure to petroleum and natural gas commodity prices and may enter into foreign
exchange forward contracts to hedge anticipated U.S. dollar denominated petroleum and natural gas sales.
The derivative financial instruments are initiated within the guidelines of the Trust’s risk management policy
and the Trust does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
The Trust designates its derivative financial instruments as hedges and performs the necessary procedures
to  enable  the  use  of  hedge  accounting.  This  includes  the  formal  documentation  of  the  hedge, linking  all
derivatives to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or specific firm commitments or forecasted
transactions  and  performing  assessments  of  hedge  effectiveness.  Derivative  contracts, accounted  for  as
hedges, are not recognized on the balance sheet. Realized gains and losses on these contracts are recognized
in petroleum and natural gas revenue and cash flows in the same period in which the revenues associated
with the hedged transaction are recognized. Premiums paid or received are deferred and amortized to earnings
over the term of the contract.
Financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges are recorded
at their fair value on the balance sheet with changes in the fair value recognized in earnings.
Revenue Recognition
Revenues from the sale of petroleum and natural gas are recorded when title passes to an external party.
Income Taxes
The Trust follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Temporary differences arising from the
differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its carrying amount on the balance sheet are
used to calculate future income tax assets or liabilities. Future income tax assets or liabilities are calculated
using tax rates anticipated to apply in the periods that the temporary differences are expected to reverse.
The Trust is a taxable entity under the Income Tax Act (Canada) and is taxable only on income that is not
distributed or distributable to the unitholders. As the Trust distributes all of its taxable income to the unitholders
and meets the requirements of the Income Tax Act (Canada) applicable to the Trust, no provision for income
taxes has been made for the Trust. The future income tax liability in the consolidated balance sheet represents
the future income tax liability of the Trust’s subsidiary.
Unit Based Compensation
The Trust has established a Performance Unit Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) for employees and directors of the
Trust or its subsidiary. The Trust uses the fair value method for valuing unit based compensation and unit
option grants. Under this method, compensation cost attributable to performance units granted is measured
at the fair value at the grant date and expensed over the vesting period with a corresponding increase to
contributed surplus. Upon the settlement of the Plan, the previously recognized value in contributed surplus
will be recorded as an increase to unitholders’ capital.
The Trust has not incorporated an estimated forfeiture rate for performance units that will not vest, rather,
the Trust accounts for actual forfeitures as they occur.

Per Unit Information
Per unit information is calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of trust units outstanding
during the fiscal year. Diluted per unit information includes the impact of the issuable exchangeable shares,
as well as, the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue units were exercised
or converted to units. Diluted per unit information is calculated using the treasury stock method that assumes
any proceeds received by the Trust upon the exercise of in-the-money unit options plus the unamortized unit
compensation cost would be used to buy back trust units at the average market price for the period.
Exchangeable Securities – Non-Controlling Interest
On March 8, 2005 the accounting abstract “Exchangeable Securities Issued by Subsidiaries of Income Trusts”
was amended effective for financial statements issued on or after June 30, 2005. Under the amended abstract,
exchangeable shares are presented as equity of the Trust only if the exchangeable shares are entitled to
receive distributions of earnings economically equivalent to distributions received by units of the trust and
the  holders  of  exchangeable  shares  can  only  dispose  of  them  by  exchanging  them  for  trust  units.  The
exchangeable shares of the Trust’s subsidiary trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange, thereby allowing holders
of the exchangeable shares to dispose of them without having to exchange them for trust units and consequently,
they must be classified as non-controlling interest outside of unitholders’ equity.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of the abstract, the Trust has retroactively restated prior periods
dating back to the Arrangement dated July 2, 2004. As a result of this change in accounting policy, the Trust
has reflected a non-controlling interest on the consolidated balance sheet of $127.2 million as at December 31,
2005 and $141.1 million as at December 31, 2004. Each redemption of exchangeable shares held by previous
Progress Energy Ltd. shareholders are accounted for as a step-purchase resulting in an increase to property,
plant and equipment, an increase to unitholders’ capital and an increase in the Trust’s future income tax
liability. Cash flow was not impacted by this change. The non-controlling interest activity for the years ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004 is disclosed in note 8. The effect of the adoption on previously reported amounts
is as presented below as increases (decreases):

2. ACQUISITION OF CEQUEL ENERGY INC. 
On July 2, 2004, pursuant to the Arrangement, Progress Energy Ltd. and Cequel amalgamated to create the
Trust and two exploration-focused companies, ProEx and Cyries. The transaction was accounted for as a business
combination with Progress being deemed the acquirer of Cequel, net of the assets acquired by Cyries. The
consideration offered was 0.695 of a trust unit for each Cequel share resulting in 45,911,352 trust units
and exchangeable shares being issued. The value of the transaction was $646.2 million, including $1.6 million
of acquisition costs. The results of Cequel have been included in these financial statements from the date
of acquisition. The transaction has been allocated as follows:
Net assets acquired (1)
Property, plant and equipment
Goodwill
Working capital deficiency
Bank debt
Asset retirement obligations
Future income taxes

(1) Pursuant to the Arrangement, assets acquired by Cyries from Cequel were accounted for prior to Progress acquiring Cequel. As a
result, the acquisition of Cequel is net of the assets acquired by Cyries.
3. PLAN OF ARRANGEMENT
Under the Arrangement, Progress Energy Ltd. transferred to ProEx certain prospective natural gas weighted
assets and undeveloped land. A future tax liability has been recorded as a result of transferring tax pools of
$32.5 million, which were in excess of the net book value of $24.6 million. The details are as follows:
Petroleum and natural gas properties
Future income tax assets
Asset retirement obligations
Total assets transferred

In accordance with the Arrangement, all outstanding stock options of Progress Energy Ltd. vested and Progress
Energy Ltd. accepted the holders’ put right thereby settling the options for cash in the amount of $21.9 million.
The after tax value of the cash settlement, net of $3.0 million of contributed surplus relating to the options,
resulted in a charge of $12.8 million to retained earnings. As a result, the remaining unamortized stock based
compensation cost relating to options granted after 2002 of $2.5 million was charged to earnings. The Trust
also incurred $0.8 million of severance costs, which together with the stock based compensation expense,
have been included in plan of arrangement expense on the consolidated statement of earnings.

As described in notes 1 and 8, the redemption of exchangeable shares held by previous Progress Energy Ltd.
shareholders are accounted for as a step-purchase. Consequently a charge of $22.2 million was made to
property, plant and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2005 (2004 – $10.4 million).
The calculation of 2005 depletion and depreciation included an estimated $26.9 million (2004 – $18.1 million)
for  future  development  costs  associated  with  proved  undeveloped  reserves  and  excluded  $24.0  million 
(2004 – $22.8 million) for the estimated future net realizable value of production equipment and facilities
and  $65.7  million  (2004  –  $71.6  million)  for  the  estimated  value  of  unproven  properties.  Depletion  and
depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $90.6 million (2004 – $58.1 million).
Included in the Trust’s property, plant and equipment balance is $12.5 million, net of accumulated depletion,
related to asset retirement obligations ($18.7 million before accumulated depletion) (Refer to note 7).
The Trust capitalized approximately $1.4 million of geological and geophysical expenses associated with the
exploration and development of capital assets during the year ended December 31, 2005 (2004 – $1.5 million).
The Trust performed a ceiling test calculation at December 31, 2005 resulting in the undiscounted cash flows
from proved reserves and the lower of cost and market of unproved properties exceeding the carrying value
of oil and gas assets. The following table summarizes the future benchmark prices the Trust used in the ceiling
test:

The Trust’s credit facilities totaling $215 million are with a syndicate of banks consisting of a $200 million
extendible revolving term credit facility and a $15 million working capital credit facility. The facilities are available
on a revolving basis for a period of at least 364 days until May 30, 2006, and such initial term out date may
be extended for further 364 day periods at the request of the Trust, subject to approval by the banks. Following
the term out date, the facilities will be available on a non-revolving basis for a one year term, at which time
the facilities would be due and payable. Various borrowing options are available under the facilities including
prime rate based advances and banker’s acceptance loans. Average cost of borrowing under these facilities
for the year ended December 31, 2005 was 4.2 percent (2004 – 3.5 percent). The credit facilities are secured
by a $500 million fixed and floating charge debenture on the assets of the Trust and by a guarantee and
subordination provided by Progress in respect of the Trust’s obligations. The $215 million borrowing base is
subject to semi-annual review by the banks.
6. CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES
On February 2, 2005 the Trust issued $100 million principal amount of 6.75 percent convertible unsecured
subordinated debentures (the “Debentures”) for net proceeds of $95.5 million. The Debentures pay interest
semi-annually and are convertible at the option of the holder at any time into fully paid trust units at a conversion
price of $15.00 per trust unit. The Debentures mature on June 30, 2010 at which time they are due and
payable. The Trust may elect to satisfy the interest and principal obligations of the Debentures by the issuance
of trust units. The net proceeds were used to reduce outstanding bank indebtedness.
The Debentures have been classified as debt net of the fair value of the conversion feature at the date of
issue which has been classified as part of unitholders’ equity and net of issue costs. Issue costs will be
amortized over the term of the Debentures and the debt portion will accrete up to the principal balance at
maturity. The accretion, amortization of issue costs and the interest paid are expensed within interest and
financing expense on the consolidated statements of earnings. If Debentures are converted to units, a portion
of the value of the conversion feature under unitholders’ equity will be reclassified to unitholders’ capital
along with the conversion price paid. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the Debenture activity:

Total interest charged to earnings for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $7.6 million which includes
$0.8 million of debenture accretion and $0.8 million of amortized issue costs.
7. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS
Asset retirement obligations were estimated based on the Trust’s net ownership interest in all wells and facilities,
the estimated costs to abandon and reclaim the wells and facilities and the estimated timing of the costs to
be incurred in future periods. The total undiscounted amount of the estimated cash flows required to settle
the asset retirement obligations is approximately $51.0 million which will be incurred over the next 43 years
with the majority of costs incurred between 2009 and 2020. A credit adjusted risk-free rate of eight percent
was used to calculate the fair value of the asset retirement obligations. In 2005 the Trust increased the inflation
rate used to calculate the obligations from 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent and revised its estimate for abandonment
and reclamation costs in certain areas. The impact of these revised estimates was an increase to the liability
of $1.7 million.

8. NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST – EXCHANGEABLE SHARES
The Trust retroactively applied the amended accounting abstract “Exchangeable Securities issued by a Subsidiary
of an Income Trust” whereby the exchangeable shares issued by the Trust’s subsidiary must be reflected as
non-controlling interest on the consolidated balance sheet and in turn, net earnings must be reduced by the
amount of net earnings attributed to the non-controlling interest.
The non-controlling interest on the consolidated balance sheet consists of the book value of exchangeable
shares issued to Progress Energy Ltd. shareholders, the fair value of exchangeable shares issued to Cequel
shareholders at the time of the Arrangement, the net earnings attributable to the exchangeable shares, less
exchangeable shares (and related cumulative earnings) redeemed. The non-controlling interest charge on the
consolidated statement of earnings represents the share of net earnings attributable to the exchangeable
shares based on the trust units issuable for exchangeable shares in proportion to total trust units issued
and issuable each period end.
The activity for non-controlling interest for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 is as follows:

The exchangeable shares can be converted, at the option of the holder, into trust units at any time and are
listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol PGE. If the number of exchangeable shares outstanding
is less than 1,600,000, the Trust can elect to redeem the exchangeable shares for trust units or an amount
in cash equal to the amount determined by multiplying the exchange ratio on the last business day prior to
the redemption date by the current market price of a trust unit on the last business day prior to such redemption
date. The number of trust units issued upon conversion is based on the exchange ratio in effect on the date
of conversion. The exchange ratio is calculated monthly based on the five day weighted average trust unit
trading price preceding the monthly effective date. The exchangeable shares are not eligible for cash distributions.
Retraction of Exchangeable Shares
Exchangeable shareholders may redeem their shares at any time by delivering their share certificates to the
Trustee, together with a properly completed retraction request. The retraction price will be satisfied with trust
units equal to the amount determined by multiplying the exchange ratio on the last business day prior to the
retraction date by the number of exchangeable shares redeemed.
Redemption of Exchangeable Shares
On July 2, 2009 the exchangeable shares will be redeemed by the Trust unless the Board of Directors of
Progress Energy Ltd. elect to extend the redemption period. The exchangeable shares will be redeemed by
either issuing units or payment in cash for an amount equivalent to the value of the exchangeable shares at
the current exchange ratio.
9. UNITHOLDERS’ CAPITAL
The Trust Indenture provides that an unlimited number of trust units may be authorized and issued. Each
trust unit is transferable, carries the right to one vote and represents an equal undivided beneficial interest
in any distributions from the Trust and in the assets of the Trust in the event of termination or winding-up of
the Trust. All trust units are of the same class with equal rights and privileges.

Redemption Right
Unitholders may redeem their trust units for cash at any time, up to a maximum of $250,000 in any calendar
month, by delivering their unit certificates to the Trustee, together with a properly completed notice requesting
redemption. The redemption amount per trust unit will be the lesser of 90 percent of the simple average
closing price of the trust units on the principal market on which they are traded for the 10 day trading period
after the trust units have been validly tendered for the redemption and the closing market price of the trust
units on the principal market on which they are traded on the date on which they were validly tendered for
redemption, or if there was no trade of the trust units on that date, the average of the last bid and ask prices
of the trust units on that date.

An adjustment to the numerator of $18.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 (2004 – $8.0 million)
is required in the diluted earnings per unit calculation to provide for earnings attributable to non-controlling
interest. Units potentially issuable on the conversion of the Debentures are anti-dilutive and are not included
in the calculation of diluted weighted average units for the year ended December 31, 2005.
Performance Unit Incentive Plan
In conjunction with the Arrangement, the Trust established a Performance Unit Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) for
employees and directors of the Trust or its subsidiary. The number of units reserved for issuance under the
Plan shall not exceed 5 percent of the aggregate number of issued and outstanding units of the Trust and
including the number of units which may be issued on the exchange of the outstanding exchangeable shares,
which may be converted into trust units. Under the Plan, performance units shall be granted by the Board of
Directors of Progress Energy Ltd. from time to time at its sole discretion. The performance units will vest on
the third anniversary of the date of grant and actual payment will be determined based on the performance
of the Trust relative to its peers. Performance factors range from 0.5 to 1.5 times the initial performance
units granted. Over the three year term the performance units will attract distributions. The Trust expects to
pay out the distribution portion in cash while the units earned will be issued from treasury.
The Board of Directors of Progress Energy Ltd. granted 395,267 performance units effective July 2, 2004.
As a result, the fair value of the performance units granted, calculated using a performance factor of 1.0,
was approximately $5.3 million of which $4.7 million will be amortized through unit based compensation expense
and $0.6 million will be capitalized over the vesting period with a corresponding increase to contributed surplus.
The Board of Directors of Progress Energy Ltd. granted 512,500 performance units effective July 2, 2005.
The fair value of the performance units using a performance factor of 1.0 was approximately $8.0 million of
which  $6.9  million  will  be  amortized  through  unit  based  compensation  expense  and  $1.1  million  will  be
capitalized over the vesting period with a corresponding increase to contributed surplus.
For  the  year  ended  December  31, 2005  $3.0  million  (2004  –  $0.5  million)  was  charged  to  unit  based
compensation expense and $0.3 million (2004 – nil) was capitalized relating to the total performance units
outstanding.

10. FUTURE INCOME TAXES
The Trust is a taxable entity under the Income Tax Act (Canada) and is taxable only on income that is not
distributed or distributable to the unitholders. Cash distributions for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled
$116.5 million, reducing the Trust’s expected future income tax expense for the year.
During 2005, income tax audits were performed on the 2002 and 2003 tax returns of Cequel and Progress
Energy Ltd. As a result of these audits, the provision for future income tax expense includes a charge of 
$3.5 million due to tax pool adjustments.
The combined provision for taxes in the consolidated statements of earnings and deficit reflect an effective
tax rate which differs from the expected statutory tax rate. Differences were accounted for as follows:
Earnings before taxes
Statutory income tax rate
Expected income taxes
Add (deduct)
Net income of the Trust
Non-deductible crown charges 
Resource allowance
Reduction in federal and provincial income tax rates
Income tax audit adjustments

12. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Trust’s financial instruments recognized in the balance sheet consist of accounts receivable, accounts
payable  and  accrued  liabilities, bank  debt  and  convertible  debentures.  The  fair  value  of  these  financial
instruments, excluding the convertible debentures, approximate their carrying amounts due to their short terms
to maturity or the indexed rate of interest on the bank debt. The fair value of the convertible debentures
outstanding as at December 31, 2005 was approximately $96.2 million.
Credit Risk
The Trust’s accounts receivable are with customers and joint venture partners in the petroleum and natural
gas business and are subject to normal credit risks. Concentration of credit risk is mitigated by marketing
production to numerous purchasers under normal industry sale and payment terms. The Trust routinely assesses
the financial strength of its customers.
The Trust may be exposed to certain losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to commodity
price contracts. The Trust mitigates this risk by entering into transactions with highly rated major financial
institutions.
Commodity Price Contracts
The Trust has entered into several derivative financial instruments for the purpose of protecting its cash flow
from operations from the volatility of natural gas commodity prices. A natural gas collar was acquired in the
Cequel  acquisition  valued  at  $1.7  million  at  June  30, 2004  and  capitalized  as  part  of  the  acquisition.
Subsequent to the acquisition $1.7 million was charged to earnings in 2004 for this collar.
