<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 15/22, extended the mandate of the 
Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 
standard of physical and mental health, as set out in its resolution 6/29.  
</p>
<p>2. In accordance with his mandate, the Special Rapporteur regularly receives 
information related to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health.  Such 
information, received from national, regional and international non-governmental 
organizations, as well as intergovernmental organizations and other United Nations 
procedures concerned with the protection of human rights, includes allegations of serious 
violations of the right to health. Where appropriate, the Special Rapporteur has sent 
communications to the States concerned and other actors, seeking clarification and urging 
remedial action. 
</p>
<p>3. The present report contains, on a country-by-country basis, summaries of 
communications sent by the Special Rapporteur to States, responses received from States, 
observations of the Special Rapporteur, and follow-up communications and activities 
relating to earlier communications, from the period of 16 March 2010 to 15 March 2011 
and replies received for the period of 2 May 2010 to 1 May 2011.  
</p>
<p>4. During the period under review, the Special Rapporteur sent a total of 46 
communications concerning the enjoyment of the right to the highest attainable standard of 
health to 29 Member States, including three communications that originated prior to 16 
March 2010 but were not included in the last year&#8217;s report (A/HRC/11/20/Add.1). The 
Special Rapporteur received 19 responses from States and two responses from other actors. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur appreciates and thanks the concerned States for these 
replies. However, he regrets that several States have failed to respond, or when they have, 
have done so in a selective manner that does not respond to all the questions arising from 
the communication. These communications remain outstanding and the Special Rapporteur 
encourages States to respond to every communication, and all concerns that were raised in 
each communication. 
</p>
<p>6. To the extent that resources available to the mandate permit, the Special Rapporteur 
continues to follow up on communications sent and monitor the situation where no reply 
has been received, where the reply received was not considered satisfactory or where 
questions remain outstanding. The Special Rapporteur also invites the sources that have 
reported the alleged cases of violations, to review cases and responses included in this 
report, and send, when appropriate, follow-up information for further consideration of the 
cases. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Summary of communications sent to States and replies 
received 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Argentina 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>7. El 22 de enero de 2010 el Relator Especial sobre los efectos nocivos para el goce de 
los derechos humanos del traslado y vertimiento de productos y desechos t&#243;xicos y 
peligrosos, junto al Relator Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las 
libertades fundamentales de los ind&#237;genas y el relator Especial sobre el derecho a la salud, 
han enviado una carta de alegaciones al Gobierno de Argentina relativa a los impactos </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>negativos causados por los desechos t&#243;xicos sobre las poblaciones ind&#237;genas locales y el 
medio ambiente producidas por la actividad minera en Abra Pampa. 
</p>
<p>8. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, la planta de fundici&#243;n de plomo Metal Huasi 
oper&#243; entre 1955 y 1987 en la ciudad de Abra Pampa, en la provincia de Jujuy, en la que 
hoy viven 9.425 personas seg&#250;n el censo de 2001. La planta se ubica a tres cuadras de la 
plaza central de Abra Pampa y estar&#237;a rodeada de zonas residenciales. A lo largo de sus 
a&#241;os en operaci&#243;n, la planta habr&#237;a expuesto a la poblaci&#243;n local a niveles inseguros de 
contaminaci&#243;n por metales pesados. La mayor&#237;a de la poblaci&#243;n pertenece al pueblo 
ind&#237;gena Kolla, que tradicionalmente ha habitado la regi&#243;n del Altiplano del norte de 
Argentina y el sur de Bolivia, cultivando papas, ma&#237;z y qu&#237;noa, y criando alpacas, ovejas y 
cabras. Se informa que tras su clausura, en el sitio de la planta habr&#237;an permanecido m&#225;s de 
15 toneladas de desechos acumulados de metales pesados, de los cuales por lo menos nueve 
toneladas tendr&#237;an altas concentraciones de plomo.  
</p>
<p>9. Al cerrar la planta, ninguna medida habr&#237;a sido tomada para tratar adecuadamente 
los desechos o para proteger a la poblaci&#243;n de la contaminaci&#243;n ocasionada por &#233;stos. Se 
reporta que los vientos y las lluvias habr&#237;an esparcido los residuos de los desechos de 
plomo por v&#237;a a&#233;rea y por filtraciones al resto de la poblaci&#243;n y que consecuentemente la 
salud y el medio ambiente de los habitantes de Abra Pampa habr&#237;an sido afectados 
negativamente. No obstante algunas intoxicaciones por plomo habr&#237;an sido registradas por 
primera vez en 1986, ninguna acci&#243;n gubernamental se habr&#237;a emprendido a la luz de este 
estudio.  
</p>
<p>10. En 2006, investigadores de la Universidad Aut&#243;noma de San Luis, M&#233;xico, el 
Ministerio Nacional de la Salud y el Grupo INQA habr&#237;an realizado un estudio sobre la 
concentraci&#243;n de plomo en el suelo de Abra Pampa. El estudio habr&#237;a detectado 
concentraciones superiores a los par&#225;metros utilizados internacionalmente y que 
representar&#237;an un riesgo serio para la salud de la poblaci&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>11. Por otro lado, el 6 de noviembre de 2007, el Gobierno de Argentina habr&#237;a suscrito 
un pr&#233;stamo con el Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo (BID) para ejecutar el &#8220;Programa 
de Gesti&#243;n Ambiental para una Producci&#243;n Sustentable en el Sector Productivo&#8221;. Entre 
otras acciones, el programa contemplar&#237;a &#8220;evaluaciones detalladas de pasivos ambientales&#8221; 
e &#8220;intervenciones integrales de remediaci&#243;n&#8221; para la Fundici&#243;n de Plomo Metal Huasi, bajo 
la supervisi&#243;n y verificaci&#243;n de la Secretar&#237;a de Miner&#237;a de la Naci&#243;n. Se reporta que de los 
40 millones de d&#243;lares estadounidenses aprobados por el BID, al 30 de noviembre de 2009 
se habr&#237;an desembolsado menos de 1.3 millones, sin que hubiera asignaciones directas para 
atender los desechos t&#243;xicos en Abra Pampa.  
</p>
<p>12. Se reporta que la poblaci&#243;n y el medio ambiente de Abra Pampa contin&#250;an 
expuestos a los efectos nocivos de los desechos t&#243;xicos de la planta Metal Huasi. El retiro 
definitivo de los desechos t&#243;xicos y la limpieza del medio ambiente a&#250;n no se habr&#237;an 
llevado a cabo. Asimismo, la situaci&#243;n de salud de la poblaci&#243;n no habr&#237;a sido debidamente 
evaluada, ni se contar&#237;a con un programa de tratamiento y seguimiento a las personas 
afectadas por la contaminaci&#243;n, lo que ser&#237;a especialmente grave en el caso de las ni&#241;as y 
los ni&#241;os. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response received 
</b></p>
<p>13. Mediante carta de fecha del 12 de febrero de 2010, el Gobierno de la Republica 
Argentina inform&#243; que la remediaci&#243;n integral de Abra Pampa se concibe y desarrolla 
respetando el car&#225;cter federal de la propiedad de los recursos naturales (Art. 41 de la 
Constituci&#243;n Nacional), y propiciando el desarrollo sustentable de la actividad minera.  
</p>
<p>14. En especifico, el Gobierno informa que la leyes sancionadas por el Poder Legislativo 
Nacional incorporan al C&#243;digo de Miner&#237;a bajo el Titulo X111 Secci&#243;n 2&#170; las normas </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1

<p>ambientales a las que deben atenerse los operadores mineros que desean desarrollar la 
actividad, estableciendo est&#225;ndares de protecci&#243;n al patrimonio ambiental, social y cultural 
(Ley 24.585). Adem&#225;s, las leyes reconocen el derecho de toda persona a ser consultada y a 
opinar, lo que se tradujo en la obligatoriedad de institucionalizar procedimientos de 
consulta o ausencias p&#250;blicas (Ley general del Ambiente). Finalmente, las Leyes crean el 
R&#233;gimen de Libre Acceso a la informaci&#243;n Publica Ambiental (ley 25.831).  
</p>
<p>15. El programa de Gesti&#243;n Ambiental para una producci&#243;n sustentable en el Sector 
Productivo AR-L1026, aprobado en noviembre 2007, que tiene a la Gesti&#243;n ambiental 
Minera como subprograma (GEAMIN), tiene por objetivo garantizarle a los habitantes el 
ejercicio efectivo de los derechos, y el brindar condiciones para que las actuales y futuras 
generaciones nazcan, crezcan y se desarrollen en un contexto socio ambientalmente 
saludable. Entre los a&#241;os 2005 y 2007 el gobierno argentino ha gestionado ante el Banco 
Interamericano de Desarrollo (BID) un Contrato de Pr&#233;stamo para la ejecuci&#243;n del 
Programa de Gesti&#243;n Ambiental para una producci&#243;n sustentable en el Sector Productivo 
AR-L1026. 
</p>
<p>16. El programa incluye un programa de Promoci&#243;n de Producci&#243;n mas limpia, a 
ejecutarse por la Secretaria de Ambiente y Desarrollo Sustentable de la Naci&#243;n y un 
Programa de Gesti&#243;n Ambiental Minera (GEAMIN), a implementarse por la Secretaria de 
Miner&#237;a de la Naci&#243;n. El Subprograma de Gesti&#243;n Ambiental Minera responde al 
compromiso asumido por el Estado Nacional y las provincias que lo suscriben, de 
desarrollar sustentablemente la industria minera en el pa&#237;s. En el marco del Subprograma 
Gesti&#243;n Ambiental Minera- GEAMIN- la Secretaria de Miner&#237;a de la Naci&#243;n ejecuta un 
componente denominado &#8220;Apoyo a la Gesti&#243;n Ambiental de las &#225;reas mineras degradadas 
por actividad pret&#233;rita&#8221;, que incluye el financiamiento para la remediaci&#243;n integral de tres 
pasivos ambientales, considerados prioritarios por su implicancia para la salud de las 
poblaciones ya su afectaci&#243;n al ambiente.

</b></p>
<p>18. On <b>1 July 2010</b>, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of 
the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health sent an allegation letter to the 
Government of Australia to call attention to information received concerning the health 
status of a Turkish citizen,<b> </b>Mr. Mehmet Ince, who was detained by the Australian 
government in Maribyrnong Detention Centre (MIDC), Melbourne. 
</p>
<p>19. According to the information received, Mr. Mehmet Ince alleged that he had been 
detained at MIDC for the last 15 months. Mr. Ince apparently had a well documented 
history of mental illness, and for the past 12 years he had received medication to treat his 
illness.  Since his detention at MIDC, his doctors had allegedly increased the doses of his 
medication to nearly double the amount he was administered while earlier in prison (to 
nearly 600mg), and had added another medication, at a dosage of 200mg.  These additions 
to his standard medication regime were allegedly due to the accumulated effects of 
detention, coupled with the long-term effects of incarceration. 
</p>
<p>20. Mr. Ince allegedly experienced insomnia and anorexia since his medication regime 
was changed, with weight loss of more than 13kg since entering detention. Mr Ince 
attributed these physiological changes to side effects of the increased dosage of medication 
he was required to take at the same time. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>21. Allegedly, the visiting psychiatrist at the MIDC had recommended a referral to the 
Toowong mental hospital in Brisbane, Queensland, but the hospital had refused to admit 
Mr. Ince as an inpatient because of Department of Immigration and Citizenship security 
requirements. The department allegedly did not consider or suggest any alternative options 
for the treatment, nor have they considered the possibility of less restrictive detention 
options, such as a Pending Removal Bridging Visa or community detention, in order to 
minimize any ongoing psychological trauma. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observation

<p>22. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of the report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to his communication.

<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>23. On <b>8 April 2010</b>, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment 
of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the Special Rapporteur on 
the human rights of migrants, the Special Rapporteur on the right to food and the Special 
Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance sent a joint allegation letter to the Government of Bangladesh to call attention to 
information received concerning the situation of unregistered Rohingya asylum-seekers, 
refugees and migrants in Bangladesh.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>24. According to information received, thousands of Rohingyas in Myanmar had sought 
refuge in Bangladesh and the majority resides in Cox&#8217;s Bazar. 28,000 of these were 
recognized as prima facie refugees by the Government of Bangladesh, and lived in official 
camps. However, an estimated 220,000 others remained unregistered and largely 
unassisted. Without official recognition, unregistered Rohingyas were not permitted to 
receive official relief. There were further reports of a spate of new arrivals that were forced 
to live as irregular migrants and were vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. 
</p>
<p>25. Unregistered Rohingya asylum-seekers, refugees and migrants in Bangladesh were 
reportedly victims of violence and attempted deportation carried out by both state and non-
state actors. Violent attacks by law enforcement agencies against unregistered Rohingya 
asylum-seekers, refugees and migrants, who had settled outside the two official refugee 
camps in Cox&#8217;s Bazar District, reportedly started on 2 January 2010. Allegedly, more than 
500 Rohingyas were arbitrarily arrested in January; some of those arrested were pushed 
back across the Myanmar border and others were charged under immigration legislation 
and sent to prisons in Bangladesh. Police raids started in Cox&#8217;s Bazar town, initially 
targeting Rohingya rickshaw pullers. In June and July 2009, local authorities were said to 
have demolished shelters and forcibly removed inhabitants in an attempt to clear a space 
around the perimeter of the official camp at Kutupalong.  
</p>
<p>26. Due to what appeared to be violent attacks on the Rohingya presence in the country, 
thousands of unregistered Rohingya asylum-seekers, refugees and migrants, had moved 
into a makeshift camp (outside two official refugee camps in the Cox&#8217;s Bazar district). 
Since October 2009, the makeshift camp had grown by 6,000 people, with 2,000 of these 
arriving in January 2010 alone. As the numbers swell, nearly 29,000 people were living in 
severely inadequate conditions with no infrastructure to support them, limited access to 
adequate nutrition and to water and sanitation facilities, and therefore at serious risk of ill 
health.  
</p>
<p>27. While thousands of Rohingya were settled and had lived in the local community for 
many years, they were reportedly perceived as a burden on the already scant resources and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>viewed as a threat to the local job market as they provided cheap labor to employers. Their 
unpopularity was fuelled by the local media, and local politicians. According to one report, 
a xenophobic campaign was being orchestrated by Anti-Rohingya Committees formed and 
allegedly funded by the local political elite, voicing their hostility to the Rohingya presence 
more loudly than ever and demanding that the Government take action against the 
Rohingya. Announcements had been disseminated by loudspeakers in villages and towns 
ordering the Rohingya to leave and also threatening locals harbouring them with arrest and 
prosecution. The local media acted as a vehicle for anti-Rohingya propaganda. 
</p>
<p>28. Serious concerns had been raised in relation to the impact of the violent attacks on 
the access to food of the residents of the makeshift camp. The Rohingya population in the 
makeshift camp were critically food insecure and a significant number of children suffered 
from acute malnutrition. According to the information received, factors contributing to this 
situation included a dramatic increase of the unregistered Rohingya population in the 
makeshift camps, a general lack of access to food relief rations and to livelihood 
opportunities as well as their inability to leave the camp for fears of being victims of 
ongoing violence against them. Further, access to food for the registered refugees in the 
adjacent Kutupalong refugee camp may also have been affected as they often shared their 
meagre food relief rations with unregistered refugees. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observation 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of the report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to his communication. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>30. On <b>21 February 2011</b>, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the Chair-
Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment sent a joint urgent appeal to the 
Government of Bangladesh to call attention to information received concerning Mr. 
Salauddin Quader Chowdhury (aged 63), a Member of Parliament from the opposition 
Bangladesh National Party (BNP). 
</p>
<p>31. According to the information received, in the early hours of 16 December 2010, Mr. 
Chowdhury was arrested by the security forces of Rapid Action Battalion, Detective Branch 
police, and the Directorate-General Foreign Intelligence at his apartment in Benani 
neighbourhood in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It is reported that the arrest was linked to an incident 
in June where a car was set on fire in Dhaka, killing a passenger. Reportedly, Mr. 
Chowdhury has not been charged, nor has he had access to a lawyer since his arrest and 
was only allowed to meet his relatives for the first time on 22 December 2010.  
</p>
<p>32. It is further reported that following his arrest on 16 December 2010, Mr. Chowdhury 
was tortured by the Bangladeshi security forces during interrogation at a private residence, 
with a physician accompanying them. Mr. Chowdhury was reportedly tortured for several 
hours, including by applying electrodes to his genitals, beating him, slitting his stomach 
with razors and twisting his toenails and fingernails with pliers. It is further reported that 
Mr. Chowdhury was repeatedly revived after falling unconscious during the ordeal. Only 
when his condition further deteriorated under interrogation, was he taken to the 
Bangabandhu Medical Hospital for treatment (at 7:30 a.m. in the morning of 16 December 
2010). Reportedly, video footage taken in the hospital grounds showed Mr. Chowdhury as 
weak, in pain, unable to walk on his own and with an apparent blood stain on his shirt. 
After an hour in the hospital, Mr. Chowdhury was reportedly taken to the headquarters of 
the Detective Branch of the Police, where he was again subjected to torture, including by </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>further electrocution. It is alleged that when Mr. Chowdhury was first visited by his 
relatives on 22 December 2010, he was in a critical health condition, his genitals and nose 
were still bleeding three days after the most recent electrocution, and there were cut marks 
on his stomach and bruises all over his body.  
</p>
<p>33. The arrest and alleged torture of Mr. Chowdhury had been widely reported in the 
local media. Following several media inquiries, the Inspector General of Police reportedly 
denied that Mr. Chowdhury had been tortured and informed the media that on the morning 
of 16 December 2010, he was taken to hospital to be treated for an asthma condition. 
</p>
<p>34. It is further reported that Mr. Chowdhury was likely to undergo additional 
interrogation by the police following the charges of involvement in crimes against 
humanity and a subsequent arrest warrant brought against him on 19 December 2010, by 
Bangladesh&#8217;s International Crimes Tribunal, which had been set up to try crimes committed 
during the 1971 war of independence. On 22 December 2010, following the Court order, 
Mr. Chowdhury was reportedly placed in Dhaka Central Prison pending proceedings in 
both the June and the 1971 cases. It is reported that Mr. Chowdhury was not present at the 
Court hearing and had not been allowed to meet his lawyers. He had reportedly been kept in 
the holding cell downstairs and was later transferred to a remote prison outside Dhaka. 
</p>
<p>35. Despite the reported deterioration in his health, Mr. Chowdhury has since his arrest 
reportedly been denied access to independent, specialized medical treatment. Moreover, the 
Government has reportedly actively sought, through the courts, to ensure that such access is 
denied. Reportedly, on 2 January 2011, in response to Mr. Chowdhury&#8217;s wife&#8217;s petition to 
the High Court Division of the Supreme Court seeking admission to a cardiac hospital for 
independent medical treatment, the High Court Division ordered on 3 January 2011, that 
Mr. Chowdhury be given access to medical treatment within two days. However, following 
an appeal by the Government, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court stayed the order 
for six weeks on 4 January 2011.  
</p>
<p>36. It is further reported that on 5 February 2011, upon arrival in Kashipur Central Jail 
where Mr. Chowdhury was being detained, Mr. Chowdhury&#8217;s relatives were told that he 
was unwell and physically unable to see them. Only when the ambulance arrived to take 
Mr. Chowdhury to hospital, was the family able to see him. It is claimed that Mr. 
Chowdhury&#8217;s health severly deteriorated while in Kashipur Central Jail, and may have had 
a stroke. It is alleged that Mr. Chowdhury was taken to the Government Bangubandhu 
Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital, but that he refused to be treated there and 
claimed to have recognised the doctors who have participated in reviving him after he was 
repeatedly tortured in December 2010. It is reported that Mr. Chowdhury was taken back to 
prison and possibly put into solitary confinement.  
</p>
<p>37. It is also reported that on 6 February 2011, the family members were not allowed to 
see Mr. Chowdhury in Kashipur Central Jail and were told by the prison guard that the 
visiting hours were over and that they should try to come back another day. In an attempt to 
visit Mr. Chowdhury on 8 February 2011, the family members and Mr. Chowdhury&#8217;s 
lawyer were told by the prison doctor that Mr. Chowdhury refused to meet them as he was 
weak and physically unable to walk.

concerning the conditions of detention at the Provisional Detention Centre in Cariacica 
(Centro de Deten&#231;&#227;o Provis&#243;ria de Cariacica). 
</p>
<p>41. According to the information received, on 4 February 2010, the Provisional

<p>42. The above-mentioned individuals, as well as those remandees whose names are not 
known are currently being held in 24 import-export type containers, measuring 28.2 
squared meters, which have been converted into cells by opening three very small barred 
windows on each side. Between 20 and 30 people are held in each container, with no 
distinction between remandees and convicted detainees. These types of containers were 
also used at the Provisional Detention Centre in Novo Horizonte in 2009. However, this 
detention facility has since been closed down.  
</p>
<p>43. The sleeping arrangements and bedding at the Provisional Detention Centre in 
Cariacica are insufficient, resulting in regular injuries due to detainees falling from 
improvised hammocks, which are necessary due to the overcrowding. In addition, there is 
no sewage system surrounding the containers, but only holes in the containers which lead 
urine and excrement to outside buckets. The water supply for drinking and washing is also </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>inadequate, as detainees only have access to water for a few minutes every couple of hours. 
Furthermore, detainees are locked up throughout the day, even during the summer months, 
facing extremely hot temperatures. Finally, information was received regarding insufficient 
medical attention, despite reports of many illnesses among the detainees. A recent outbreak 
of scabies forced the authorities to burn all mattresses and uniforms. Additionally, on 4 
February 2010, a man called &#8220;Adoterivo&#8221;, who suffered from hypertension, reportedly died 
due to the lack of medical attention and the poor conditions in the containers. 
</p>
<p>44. In addition to the physical conditions at the Provisional Detention Centre in 
Cariacica, it is alleged that detainees have been regularly threatened or subjected to 
violence, including with rubber and lead bullets, as well as pepper and tear gas. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response received 
</b></p>
<p>45. By letter dated <b>20 August 2010</b>, the Government of Brazil responded to the 
aforementioned allegation letter sent on 6 April 2010. It indicated that the situation 
prompted action of Brazilian State bodies involving investigation of the nature and extent 
of complaints regarding the operation of Espirito Santo&#8217;s prison system, and spurred in 
response the adoption of measures to overcome the problems identified.  
</p>
<p>46. The government was aware of inadequacy of prison facilities in the Espirito Santo 
State, noting that some facilities did not provide inmates with academic study space or with 
work activities.  Family visits lasted approximately fifteen minutes and took place in the 
prison lounge due to absence of a designated area for this purpose. Water was provided for 
twenty minutes per hour. Health checks were provided either on-site or in public care 
facilities should the detainees require hospital admission.  
</p>
<p>47. The relevant bodies that have become engaged in the issue are the Council for the 
Defence of the Human Person, the National Council for Crime and Prison Policy and the 
National Justice Council.  
</p>
<p>48. The first two institutions conducted visits to a number of state prison facilities and 
have discussed with Espirito Santo officials measures to address the identified problems.  
</p>
<p>49. The National Justice Council signed an agreement with the Espirito Santo State 
Government in which the local government commits itself to taking measures to address the 
issues identified in the prison system.  Following this, the National Justice Council 
conducted on-site visits to monitor compliance with the commitments made in the 
agreement.  
</p>
<p>50. Additionally, a monitoring, follow-up, enhancement and inspection group was 
established to oversee the state&#8217;s prison system. 
</p>
<p>51. The Espirito Santo State Government has taken various measures to mitigate the 
problems affecting states&#8217; prisons, such as the transfer of inmates held in police precincts to 
provisional detention centers, replacing military police officers assigned to detention 
centers with correction officers, expanding health assistance and job placement programs 
for prisoners.  
</p>
<p>52. However, overcoming the challenge of overcrowded detention facilities requires a 
long-term effort to expand space available and enhance prison management, especially as 
the shortage of prison places in units administered by the Espirito Santo State Secretariat of 
Justice has reached a total of 6,926. 
</p>
<p>53. To do so, construction and renovation of prisons have been undertaken: eleven 
prison units were expected to be completed by March 2011. Besides, the Espirito Santo 
State Under-Secretary for Prison Affairs committed to preventing further mixing of 
provisional detainees with convicted offenders.  </p>

</b></p>
<p>54. With regard to Adoterivo Vieira Sabarense&#8217;s death, the Government of Brazil 
indicated that he received health monitoring and several referrals to hospital units. The 
medical report as well as his death certificate do not suggest that his death was the result of 
inappropriate medical treatment, but investigation will continue until the circumstances and 
reasons of his death are clarified.  
</p>
<p>55. Finally, the Government of Brazil reaffirmed its commitment to promoting and 
protecting human rights and expressed its appreciation for the work of the Special 
Procedures System of the United Nations Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observation

<p>56. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its response received on 20

<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>57. On <b>1 November 2010,</b> the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health sent an 
allegation letter in relation to the legal status of abortion and reproductive self-
determination in Brazil. 
</p>
<p>58. According to information received, in Brazil, abortion is permitted only in cases of 
rape or to save the life of a pregnant woman. In every other circumstance, Brazil&#8217;s Penal 
Code reportedly penalizes women who undergo induced abortions, with penalties ranging 
from one to three years of imprisonment and physicians providing abortions may receive 
sentences of up to 20 years&#8217; imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>59. It is reported that, between 1989 and 2009, only 1,606 women were able to procure 
legal abortions in Brazil. Furthermore, it is reported that only 40 public hospitals in Brazil 
provide abortion services, and five Brazilian states do not provide any access to legal 
abortion services (Mato Grosso do Sul, Amap&#225;, Piaui, Roraima and Tocantins). Up to one 
million unsafe abortions are estimated to occur annually in Brazil, and up to 250,000 
women annually are estimated to be treated in hospitals for complications of unsafe 
abortion. Post-abortion dilatation and curettage (which the World Health Organization 
recommends only be used when safer methods of vacuum aspiration and medical abortion 
are unavailable) is reportedly the second most common obstetric procedure performed in 
public hospitals in Brazil, following self-administration of drugs to induce a medical 
abortion (which are not legally available for purchase in Brazil).  
</p>
<p>60. In May 2010, it is reported that the Commission on Social Security and Family of 
the House of Representatives in Brazil approved bill 478/07, which seeks to establish rights 
for the &#8220;unborn.&#8221; In this bill, the embryo is defined as a human being, with life beginning at 
the time of conception, before reaching the uterus through natural means or following in 
vitro fertilization.  
</p>
<p>61. Concern is expressed that should the bill pass into law, it may potentially be invoked 
to criminalize further women&#8217;s access to abortion services, even in circumstances currently 
permitted under the Penal Code (to save a pregnant woman&#8217;s life and in case of rape). As 
such, the proposed legislation could undermine women&#8217;s rights to health, including 
reproductive health, and to physical integrity.

<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>63. On <b>25 March 2010</b>, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia sent a joint allegation letter 
concerning the draft Law on Drug Control in Cambodia.  
</p>
<p>64. According to the information received, Cambodia&#8217;s existing Drug Law, which was 
adopted in 1996 and amended in 2005, provides that a person can be ordered into treatment 
by various authorities. These include prosecutors, who may summon a person charged with 
illegal drug consumption to court and issue an order to attend &#8220;any detoxicating 
establishment&#8221;. For this same offense, a court may order that the person &#8220;undertake an 
appropriate treatment measure[s] in accordance with his/her health condition&#8221;. Following a 
sentence, a person convicted of illegal drug consumption may request &#8220;medical treatment in 
accordance with their respective health conditions&#8221;, rather than serving the sentence. A 
person can also be ordered to receive drug dependency treatment if a spouse, parents, 
relatives or a prosecutor request a civil court to issue an order, and the court is convinced 
that the person is addicted to illegal drugs and &#8220;is known as dangerous for others&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>65. Although the law may be useful for people who are drug dependent and in need of 
treatment, many of the provisions are too broad, with few or no procedural safeguards 
against abuse. The law also allows persons to be committed without their consent and 
without a limit to the duration of such treatment, oversight or review of the treatment order. 
A further concern is that the broad provisions in the law can lead to many non drug-
dependent persons to receive unnecessary treatment, as the drug detention centers often 
hold people who do not meet the criteria of the National Authority for Combating Drugs 
(NACD) for drug dependence. According to the information received, 25% of those 
detained for crystal methamphetamine in 2008 were &#8220;not dependent&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>66. The draft Law on Drug Control contains several provisions which are of the same 
nature as the current Drug Law, by awarding broad powers for a court to compel a person 
to accept drug treatment. According to article 72, a person may be forced into drug 
treatment under the following conditions: (i) At the request of a spouse, parents, relatives or 
prosecutor, a civil court may order a person into drug treatment if the person is &#8220;drug 
dependent and is known to be dangerous to others&#8221;; (ii) By the court, if the person commits 
a designated offence and the person is &#8220;intoxicated&#8221; by a controlled substance; and (iii) At 
the referral or arrest of a guardian, relative or authority. These provisions may lead to an 
arbitrary application of the law, as the determination that an individual is &#8220;known as 
dangerous to others&#8221; is vague and may be implemented in a very broad manner. 
Additionally, the provision allowing a spouse, parent or relatives to request a person&#8217;s 
detention is open to abuse by those who may be motivated by embarrassment or would like 
to have their family members out of their lives for some time, rather than seeking treatment 
that may be in that person&#8217;s best interests. Compulsory treatment should rather be limited to 
cases where the person is in imminent danger of harm to him or herself or poses imminent 
physical danger to others due to their drug dependence. 
</p>
<p>67. Additionally, several provisions in the draft law are not in compliance with the 
UNODC/WHO Principles of Drug Dependence Treatment, which require that drug 
dependence treatment, like other medical treatment, may be carried out on a person without 
or contrary to his/her consent only in clearly defined exceptional circumstances. Any 
detention should also be subjected to a clearly defined time limit to review its continued 
necessity and that the person subjected to compulsory treatment, or legal representative, has 
a right and is able to challenge the legality of the detention. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>68. A separate concern raised by the draft law concerns article 67(5), which states that 
&#8220;officers who implement drug treatment and rehabilitation measures in accordance with the 
right to drug treatment shall not be prosecuted for their activities&#8221;. This provides immunity 
for officials who commit serious abuses in the course of their duties. The &#8220;right to drug 
treatment&#8221; should only be applicable when a patient has submitted to treatment on the basis 
of fully informed consent, as stated in article 67(2), and not when a person is undergoing 
compulsory treatment. However, it has been alleged that based on the current practice, all 
treatment in drug treatment centers are considered voluntary, thus leading to immunity for 
those officers who may commit abuses against people in compulsory treatment. On the 
other hand, the draft law should ensure a prompt, independent, thorough investigation and 
prosecution of perpetrators of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.

Government of China regarding the state of health of Mr. Hu Jia, a Beijing-based 
HIV/AIDS activist, co-founder and former director of the Beijing Aizhixing Institute for 
Health Education. Mr Hu Jia has been the subject of communications sent by several 
mandate holders following his detention on 27 December 2007 and his sentencing on 3 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1 
</b></p>

on 23 April 2008. The combined response of China&#8217;s Government to these communications 
was received on 4 June 2008. 
</p>
<p>74. According to the information received, Mr. Hu Jia was sentenced to 3.5 years in 
prison in April 2008. He previously suffered from cirrhosis of the liver, and was transferred 
on 30 March 2010 from Beijing City Prison to Beijing City Hospital to undergo tests. Mr. 
Hu Jia has remained in Beijing City Hospital since then and allegedly his state of health is 
rapidly deteriorating. It is believed that the poor nourishment and bad conditions in prison 
contributed to his ailing health. Although the results of the medical tests have not yet been 
shared with members of his family, it is feared that Mr. Hu Jia may be suffering from liver 
cancer. Ms. Zeng Jinyan, the wife of Mr. Hu Jia, has formally requested the relevant prison 
authorities to release him on medical grounds.  
</p>

<p>77. On <b>22 September 2010</b>, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders sent a joint urgent appeal regarding 
the situation of Mr. Tian Xi, an activist who has reportedly been detained for his advocacy 
on issues related to HIV/AIDS. 
</p>
<p>78. According to the information received, Mr. Tian Xi, a 23-year-old college graduate 
from Henan Province, reportedly sustained a head injury in an accident as a child, which 
required a blood transfusion as treatment. The blood transfusion allegedly infected him with 
HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Since then, Mr. Tian Xi and his family have reportedly 
petitioned the hospital and local government for compensation, both for himself and for 
others infected with HIV. Allegedly, thousands of people in Henan and other provinces 
were infected with HIV through state-sponsored blood selling programs in the 1990s, and 
through resulting hospital transmissions of HIV from infected blood and blood products. 
</p>
<p>79. Henan provincial courts reportedly refuse to accept any lawsuits relating to HIV, 
leaving victims with no legal recourse. It is reported that where no other recourse exists in 
China, citizens may bring complaints against local officials to higher-ranking government 
offices, but that only a small percentage of these complaints receive a favourable response. 
It is reported that Henan authorities have detained individuals trying to draw attention to the 
issue of compensation for HIV transmission through contaminated blood and blood 
products. 
</p>
<p>80. It also has been reported that Mr. Tian Xi worked for several years at Aizhixing 
Health Education Institute, a non-governmental Chinese AIDS organization. In spring 
2010, Mr. Wan Yanhai, the founder and director of Aizhixing, reportedly relocated his 
family to the United States, alleging government harassment.  
</p>
<p>81. On 23 July 2010 Mr. Tian Xi reportedly received a text message from the Xincai 
County Clerk, inviting him to return to Henan to negotiate a resolution to his HIV/AIDS 
issue. Mr. Tian Xi subsequently returned home to Henan and reportedly the Xincai County </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>Clerk made several appointments to meet Mr. Tian Xi.  However, on each occasion, when 
Mr. Tian Xi arrived for the appointment, he was unable to see the Clerk.  
</p>
<p>82. On 5 August 2010, Mr. Tian Xi reportedly visited the Xincai Number One People&#8217;s 
Hospital to see the hospital director about obtaining HIV medication, as he did not bring a 
sufficient quantity with him to Henan. It is alleged that the hospital director told Mr. Tian 
Xi that he did not possess the authority to provide the required medication. It is reported 
that Mr. Tian Xi was upset by this response and allegedly broke some tea cups in the 
hospital director&#8217;s office.  
</p>
<p>83. On 6 August 2010, the Xincai County Police allegedly took Mr. Tian Xi away, 
leaving the family with a 15-day detention order. It appears that he may have been briefly 
released, as it is reported that Mr. Tian Xi contacted Asia Catalyst on 10 August 2010, 
indicating that he was at risk of arrest. Documents from the Town Board of Lugu Township 
reportedly exist, which, inter alia, request the police to detain Mr. Tian Xi in connection 
with his HIV/AIDS advocacy; conclude that Mr. Tian Xi had been influenced by Mr. Wan 
Yanhai, the Chinese AIDS activist; and recommend that Mr. Tian Xi be &#8220;taken in to public 
security.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>84. On 17 August 2010, it is alleged that the police took Mr. Tian Xi to the Xincai 
County Number Two People&#8217;s Hospital for treatment, where he remained for two days. On 
18 August 2010, the Xincai County Police allegedly issued an order for Mr. Tian Xi&#8217;s 
detention on &#8220;suspicion of intentional destruction of property,&#8221; apparently for the broken 
tea cups during his meeting with the hospital director of Xincai Number One People&#8217;s 
Hospital. On 19 August 2010, the police reportedly took him away, and Mr. Tian Xi was 
transferred from administrative to criminal detention in the Shangcai County Detention 
Centre. On 21 August 2010, Mr. Tian Xi&#8217;s mother and aunt reportedly went to the Shangcai 
County police station to see him, but were refused.  
</p>
<p>85. Concern is expressed that the detention of Mr. Tian Xi may not be based on the 
&#8220;suspicion of intentional destruction of property,&#8221; but instead be motivated by Mr. Tian 
Xi&#8217;s ongoing petitioning to seek compensation and treatment for hospital transmissions of 
HIV from infected blood and blood products. Concern is also expressed that Mr. Tian Xi 
may not be receiving appropriate and adequate medical treatment while being held in 
detention. At this stage we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the above described 
allegations and we wish to seek clarification from your Excellency&#8217;s Government in this 
regard.

Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment sent a 
joint urgent appeal to the Government of China concerning the situation of Mr. Wei 
Danquan, aged 42, a detainee at the Jidong Prison in Tangshan City, the People&#8217;s Republic 
of China.  
</p>
<p>88. According to the information received, on 26 May 2008, Mr. Wei was arrested by 
Shanhaiguan police at his work place. In June 2008, Mr. Wei was sentenced to four years&#8217; 
imprisonment by a Shanhaiguan Court and was reportedly transferred to Jidong Prison in 
Tangshan City. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1

<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>89. On 8 October 2008, Mr. Wei&#8217;s wife found him in critical health conditions when she 
visited him in prison. Mr. Wei had reportedly become very thin, pale and weak and was 
unable to lift up his head in the visiting room. It is reported that on 27 October 2008, Mr. 
Wei&#8217;s health has deteriorated significantly. It was alleged that the prison officials ignored 
Mr. Wei&#8217;s family&#8217;s request to release him for medical parole allegedly claiming that Mr. 
Wei&#8217;s situation was not serious enough to qualify for medical parole. 
</p>
<p>90. On 18 May 2010, one of Mr. Wei&#8217;s relatives talked to physician in charge of the 
prison. It was reported that Mr. Wei&#8217;s relative was told that an X-ray taken on 30 April 
2010 had reportedly revealed that Mr. Wei had developed type III tuberculosis in the left 
upper lobe of his lung, and fluid had accumulated in the lung. Mr. Wei was extremely thin 
and lost consciousness several times. It was claimed that Mr. Wei had blood in his phlegm, 
and suffered from persistent cough and chest pain. It was reported that there are three holes 
in his lung and the lung membrane has become thicker and sticky causing him breathing 
difficulties.  
</p>
<p>91. In view of Mr. Wei&#8217;s deteriorating health, serious concern was expressed about his 
physical and mental integrity. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response received 
</b></p>
<p>92. On <b>2 December 2010, </b>the Government of China replied to the joint urgent appeal of 
4 November 2010 and made the following reply which is reproduced in its entirety: 
</p>
<p>93. Wei Danquan is an ethnic Zhuang male born in 1967 and residing in Zhangjiakou, 
Hebei Province. On 18 June 2008 he was sentenced, in accordance with the law, by the 
people&#8217;s court of Shanhaiguan district, Qinhuangdao, Hebei Province, to 4 years&#8217; 
imprisonment (26 May 2008 to 25 May 2012) for the crime of using a cult to subvert law 
enforcement; he is currently serving his sentence at Jidong prison in Hebei Province. 
</p>
<p>94. Wei had already contracted tuberculosis prior to entering prison. In May 2010, 
presenting symptoms such as a cough, chest pains and weakness, he underwent a hospital 
examination which diagnosed tuberculosis in his right lung and tuberculous pleurisy; the 
next day he was admitted for treatment. After entering hospital, he was assigned, in the 
light of his condition, to the infectious respiratory diseases unit for a systematic course of 
treatment involving nutritional support, antitubercular medication and cough suppressants. 
Chest x-rays were regularly taken, his liver and kidney functions were tested and he was 
given routine blood tests as well as blood sedimentation tests. Since leaving the hospital he 
undergoes monthly medical examinations and is still under the care of the hospital. Under 
Chinese law, such a condition does not qualify prisoners for release on medical grounds, 
and neither Wei nor his representative have requested it.

Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and 
the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief sent a joint urgent appeal to the 
Government of China regarding the situation of Mr. Qiao Yongfang, a practitioner of Falun 
Gong, who was being detained in the Hohhot No 1 Men&#8217;s Prison in the People&#8217;s Republic 
of China.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1

<p>97. On 6 August 2010, Mr. Yongfang, aged 60, a Falun Gong practitioner, was 
sentenced by the Huimin District People&#8217;s Court to three years&#8217; imprisonment on charges of 
&#8220;using a heretical organization to subvert the law&#8221;. Mr. Yongfang was reportedly held in 
the Hohhot (&#8220;Huhehaote&#8221; in Chinese) No 1 Men&#8217;s Prison. In September 2010, Mr. 
Yongfang was reported to have been transferred to a separate special unit within the prison 
referred to as a &#8216;prison training team&#8217;. It was alleged that Falun Gong practitioners were 
often held in separate prison facilities where they were reportedly being tortured and ill-
treated and forced to renounce their belief.  
</p>
<p>98. It was reported that Mr. Yongfang was in poor health conditions. He suffered from 
diabetes, for which he was allegedly not receiving adequate medical treatment. Mr. 
Yongfang&#8217;s lawyers alleged that he had previously been tortured while in detention, and 
sustained injuries on his head, for which, it was alleged, he did not receive adequate 
medical treatment. 
</p>
<p>99. Concern was expressed about the health of Mr. Yongfang. In view of allegation that 
Mr. Yongfang was transferred to a special unit within the prison, serious concern was 
expressed about his physical and mental integrity.

</p>
<p>101. Qiu Yongfang is an ethnic Han male born in 1950 and residing in Zhangjiakou, 
Hebei Province. Because he made use of a cult to subvert the law, on 21 June 2010 he was 
sentenced by the Huimin District People&#8217;s Court in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia Autonomous 
Region, to 3 years&#8217; imprisonment (9 June 2009 to 8 June 2012). He is now serving his 
sentence at No. 2 prison in Hohhot. 
</p>
<p>102. During a medical examination upon his admission to prison, Qiu stated that he had 
had diabetes for 10 years and had always taken medication for it. The prison medical 
examination concluded that his health was normal. Once he was in prison, no complaints 
were filed on this subject, either by Qiu or on his behalf. Accusations in the communication 
such as those stating that Qiu is &#8220;not receiving adequate medical treatment&#8221; and &#8220;was 
transferred to a special unit&#8221; do not reflect the actual situation. 
</p>
<p>103. During a medical examination upon his admission to prison, Mr Yongfang stated 
that he had had diabetes for 10 years and had always taken medication for it. The prison 
medical examination concluded that his health was normal. The government added that 
once he was in prison, no complaints were filed on this subject, either by Mr Yongfang or 
on his behalf. The Government of China concluded that accusations in the communication 
such as those stating that Mr Yongfang is &#8220;not receiving adequate medical treatment&#8221; and 
&#8220;was transferred to a special unit&#8221; did not reflect the actual situation.

</p>
<p><b>  Response received 
</b></p>
<p>106. The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that it had found the allegations 
of ill-treatment to be inaccurate. The subject was receiving regular medical care and was 
being kept in a ward with about sixty other people. The Government also indicated that the 
authorities had made available reports on his mental condition as and when demanded by 
the local court where the matter was sub justice. According to the last report, the subject 
was not yet fit to stand trial.

<p>108. On <b>1 July 2010</b>, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of 
the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health sent an allegation letter to the 
Government of India concerning the health situation of the citizens of Manipur, who were 
being affected by political activity and conflict within the region.   
</p>
<p>109. It was alleged that the ongoing economic blockade enforced by All Naga Student 
Association Manipur (ANSAM) and others in the Indian state of Manipur since 11 April 
2010 were having deleterious effects on the right to health of the people of Manipur. The 
strike was allegedly resulting in the blockade of two national highways which were the 
major supply routes of Manipur (whose population is 2.4 million), resulting in acute 
shortages of food, medicine and other essential commodities in the state. The strike was in 
protest against the state government's notification for holding elections in various districts 
of Manipur, and the organizations in question had allegedly declared the initial strike to be 
extended for an indefinite period. 
</p>
<p>110. Allegedly, in the more remote districts of Manipur government food storage 
facilities were exhausted, and health care infrastructure had collapsed &#8211; these structures 
were already fragile due to the ongoing conflict situation in the state. In the capital city, the 
government and private hospitals had allegedly closed down emergency services, and were 
unable to maintain life support systems due to shortage of essential supplies including 
medicines and nasal cannula oxygen. 
</p>
<p>111. The price of food grains and other household supplies like rice, kerosene and 
cooking gas had also allegedly escalated to such a level that residents could not afford to 
buy household provisions anymore, and fuel supplies had also ceased, inhibiting transport 
services.  
</p>
<p>112. Allegedly, in one particular incident, two protestors supporting a visiting dignitary 
were killed, and a group of 80 men and women were injured and hospitalized in the police 
action, which triggered further protests.  
</p>
<p>113. As this political situation continued, the Government of India was allegedly failing 
to take any action to ensure that lifesaving drugs and other essential medical supplies were 
made available to the people of Manipur. </p>

supplies of food item, health care items and other essential items by providing security 
convoys along relevant national highways. 
</p>
<p>115. The Government indicated that contrary to the allegations contained in the 
communication, the emergency services in both public and private hospitals were 
functioning as usual and that stocks of medicines and life saving drugs had been airlifted in 
May and June 2010. The authorities constituted task forces and rapid response teams in 
order to take immediate containment measures.

enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment sent a 
joint allegation letter concerning the lack of access to palliative care and pain treatment in 
India. 
</p>
<p>118. According to the information received, more than half of India&#8217;s Regional Cancer 
Centres did not offer any palliative care for pain management. Only 10 of the 29 existing 
Regional Cancer Centres had effective programmes and five others offer limited palliative 
care. It was estimated that more than one million people suffered from moderate to severe 
pain due to advanced cancer, and only a few received proper treatment. The same occurred 
for people with HIV/AIDS, paraplegics, patients with advanced renal diseases and others 
who required palliative care. Additionally, many of the Regional Cancer Centres did not 
have health workers who were trained in palliative care. 
</p>
<p>119. With regard to the availability of morphine, hospitals and pharmacies generally 
stopped stocking it as a result of the adoption in 1985 of the Narcotic Drugs and 
Psychotropic Substances Act. The Act had been created in order to create a balance 
between the obligation to ensure the availability of opioids for medical purposes and to take 
steps to prevent their misuse. However, burdensome licensing procedures in state 
regulations meant that hundreds of thousands of patients did not have access to the 
necessary medications. In 2008, only 4% of those requiring morphine had access to it. In 
1998, the national Department of Revenue drafted a model rule for states to use in order to 
simplify the medical use of morphine. The Department at the time indicated that existing 
regulations denied &#8220;easy availability of morphine to even terminally ill cancer patients&#8221;, 
and caused &#8220;undue sufferings and harassment&#8221;. However, despite this recommendation by 
the Department of Revenue, only 14 of the 35 states had implemented the model rule. 
</p>
<p>120. In terms of policy, there was no national palliative care policy or program and, 
despite the fact that considerable resources had reportedly been invested to strengthen the 
cancer care system in India, very few funds had been allocated to palliative care. At the 
state level, only Kerala had a palliative care program in place. 
</p>
<p>121. The failure to ensure availability of palliative care left many patients suffering from 
severe pain, which may constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. </p>

<p>123. On <b>28 September 2010, </b> the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and 
the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief sent a joint allegation letter to the 
Government of India concerning the situation of 65 Pakistani members of the Mehdi 
Foundation International (MFI) who were detained in Central Jail Tihar, New Delhi, India. 
Their case had been subject of an urgent appeal sent jointly by the Special Rapporteur on 
freedom of religion or belief and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture on 26 
September 2007 (see A/HRC/7/10/Add.1, paras. 100-104) and the Special Rapporteurs 
wanted to acknowledge receipt of India&#8217;s Government&#8217;s response dated 12 February 2009 
(reproduced in A/HRC/13/40/Add.1, para. 101). 
</p>
<p>124. According to new information received, since their arrival in Central Jail Tihar in 
April 2007, Ms. Safia Shafi, Ms. Bushra Mansoor, Ms. Shabana Gohar, Ms. Samira Wasim 
and Ms. Anisa Jabbar who were pregnant at the time of their arrest have given birth to five 
children. Reportedly, medical staff treated the pregnant MFI women inhumanly and slapped 
their faces during delivery. After delivery, no food or medication was given to the women 
for the next two days, while in the hospital food is usually served two times a day. Sanitary 
pads were not provided after delivery. One MFI woman was not administered stitches 
correctly and subsequently new stitches were readministered without any local anesthetic. 
During a medical checkup in Deen Dayal Hospital, it was found that Ms. Qamar Parveen 
and Ms. Sajida Waheed have cysts in their ovaries. While surgery was recommended, the 
Senior Medical Officer refused this, reportedly stating that &#8220;You take care of it at your own 
expense outside after your jail term.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>125. On 28 January 2010, the Government of India rejected the applications made on 
behalf of the MFI detainees for political asylum and subsequently all criminal charges 
against them were reportedly withdrawn. The MFI members continue to be held in custody, 
pending a decision by the courts on whether their deportation to Pakistan would be lawful.  
</p>
<p>126. In Central Jail Tihar, the MFI members are detained in unsanitary and overcrowded 
facilities which have reportedly resulted in communicable diseases. If MFI detainees are 
sick they are scarcely referred to an external hospital and the prison authorities make them 
clean drainage lines with their bare hands. 
</p>
<p>127. Mr. Iqbal Shahi suffers from fits and there is neither medical care in the prison nor is 
he referred to outside physicians. Mr. Iqbal Shahi has been diagnosed with a tumor in his 
brain; however, reportedly no medical help is forthcoming. 
</p>
<p>128. Mr. Muhammad Ashfaque is diabetic and suffers from an illness affecting his 
backbone. The prison staff only gave him Metaformin tablets and his sugar level is getting 
higher. When Mr. Muhammad Ashfaque raised this issue with the prison staff he was 
reportedly told that &#8220;medication is very expensive outside and we cannot afford it, nor can 
we refer you to an outside hospital&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>129. Mr. Abdul Waheed underwent heart bypass surgery before his arrest and is still 
suffering from acute heart-related illnesses and blood pressure. Reportedly, he is not getting 
proper medical treatment but only receives pain-killers. The prison authorities asked Mr. 
Abdul Waheed to take care of his medical needs at his own expense from outside. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>130. Mr. Abdul Rashid is diabetic, but the prison authorities did not allow him to visit an 
Outpatient Department. Due to high diabetic condition his eyesight deteriorated and he has 
blurred vision.  
</p>
<p>131. Ms. Kulsoom Khan suffered from fever in May 2007. The prison authorities gave 
her medication that did not help and the prison staff allegedly beat her. Ms. Kulsoom Khan 
was then sent to Deen Dayal Hospital where some liquid was withdrawn from her spine 
which generated pain in her lower spine. In Deen Dayal Hospital, Ms. Kulsoom Khan was 
reportedly given electric shocks once or twice daily. She was tied to the bed with ropes and 
would be unconscious for hours. Upon her return to Central Jail Tihar she was weak but she 
was reportedly refused to special diet including milk, egg, cheese and fruit. Ms. Kulsoom 
Khan developed anemia, however, she did not receive medication nor proper medical care. 
</p>
<p>132. Currently, eleven MFI children remain in detention in Central Jail Tihar (Farah Naz 
Gohar, Sana Riaz, Shahzaib, Hassan AlGohar, Asad Gohar, Zill-e-Gohar, Mary Gohar, 
Abhaya Gohar, Aamir Gohar, Tabassum Gohar and Abasah Gohar). However, the prison 
authorities do not have the required medication for children and the detained children are 
given adults&#8217; medication instead. Thus the two-year-old Ms. Abasah Gohar was given full 
antibiotics over 15 days and subsequently developed gastric problems. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response received 
</b></p>
<p>133. On <b>14 February 2011</b>, the Government of India replied to the joint allegation letter 
of 28 September 2010. The Government indicated that it found the allegations to be 
inaccurate. The Government&#8217;s investigations into the subject showed that all inmates 
detained in Tihar&#8217;s Central Jail were provided with due attention and medical care. In case 
of serious diseases, inmates are taken to hospitals outside the jail with all costs being borne 
by the jail.  
</p>
<p>134. Mr. Iqbal Shahi was under regular treatment at one of India&#8217;s most renowned 
hospitals. Mr. Abdul Rashid was referred to an eye specialist. The allegations that Mr. 
Ashfaq and Mr. Waheed were asked to take care of their medical needs at their own 
expense was unfounded, as all prescribed medicines were being provided to them free of 
charge.  
</p>
<p>135. For women inmates, the Government indicated that a gynecological camp was 
organized within the premises in collaboration with a private hospital as part of the 
campaign to diagnose diseases early. All pregnant women were provided with adequate 
pre-natal as well as post-natal care. The allegation that pregnant women were treated 
inhumanely during after birth were unfounded. All children were housed in a cr&#232;che, fed 
and vaccinated adequately. The allegation that children were given adult medication was 
incorrect, as sufficient pediatric drugs were made available in the jail dispensary.

enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and the 
Independent Expert on access to safe drinking water and sanitation sent a joint allegation 
letter to the Government of India concerning the situation of hundreds of villagers in the 
districts of Rayagada, Nuapada, Kashipur, Nabarangpur, Koraput, Kalahandi, Malkangiri 
and Balangir in the state of Orissa, India. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>138. It was alleged that since the last rainy season in August 2009, villagers in the above 
mentioned districts in Orissa had been dying in great numbers of diarrhea, cholera and other 
water-borne diseases, and it was reported that the government had not taken substantial 
action to prevent such diseases in these largely tribal, poor and rural areas.  
</p>
<p>139. In 2007, the Chief Minister of Orissa visited Rayagada district, the most affected 
area, and allegedly promised to provide safe drinking water to the villages. Reportedly, the 
government invested a great deal of money to install tube wells to supply drinking water. It 
was reported that the villagers did not find the wells satisfactory. Local human rights 
groups claimed that the actual depth of the tube did not meet the required standards for safe 
drinking.  
</p>
<p>140. Reportedly, the Orissa state government spent INR 133.85 crores (USD 28.9 
millions) on services, including the digging of 65,680 tube wells between the years 2001 to 
</p><p>2006. According to an official report (the Comptroller and Auditor General&#8217;s report) 2,103 
died of diarrhea between 2002 and 2006 in these districts.  
</p>
<p>141. Most recently, it was reported that the Collector of Rayagada district visited 
Rayagada and ordered drinking water to be supplied by tankers. However, it was reported 
that these water tankers provided water for four days only, after which villagers were 
allegedly driven to drink local pond water. It was also alleged that many of the villages 
continued to lack access to safe drinking water. 
</p>
<p>142. In addition to these claims, it was alleged that basic health facilities, goods and 
services, including human resources, were substantially lacking in the abovementioned 
districts. For example, whereas 65 doctors were approved for the Nuapada district, 28 posts 
(43 per cent) allegedly still remained vacant. The state government was allegedly sending 
doctors, medicines and food, and setting up emergency camps in the affected villages, but 
reportedly nowhere near the appropriate pace or in sufficient numbers.

<p>144. On <b>24 January 2011 </b>the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health sent an 
allegation letter to the Government of India concerning the effect of the proposed European 
Union&#8211;India free trade agreement on access to medicines, both within India and in other 
parts of the developing world. 
</p>
<p>145. According to the information received, the European Union (hereafter &#8220;EU&#8221;) and 
India have been negotiating a free trade agreement (FTA) for a number of years, and 
reportedly it was to be concluded sometime this spring. It was alleged that if India entered 
into a free trade agreement with the EU that included &#8220;TRIPS-plus&#8221; provisions, its ability to 
produce generic medicines for domestic and international consumption would be restricted. 
As a result, millions of people in India and around the world &#8211; in particular people living 
with HIV many of whom are dependent on generic medicines produced in India &#8211; would 
allegedly lose access to necessary medicines. 
</p>
<p>146. It was reported that in India out-of-pocket expenditure amounts to the largest share 
of health expenditure and that about 70 per cent of that expenditure went towards buying 
medicines. Therefore, the affordability and availability of medicines directly impact the 
rights to health and to an adequate standard of living for citizens of India. It was reported 
that medicines were sold at relatively affordable prices in India because most of the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>23 
</b></p>
<p>medicines were locally produced and due to competition among companies producing 
generic medicines.  
</p>
<p>147. Reports indicate India is the largest global supplier of low-cost, good quality 
medicines, most of which go to the developing world. It was reported that 67 per cent of 
medicines exported from India went to developing countries and 92 per cent of HIV/AIDS 
patients in low- and middle-income countries used generic antiretroviral drugs produced in 
India. Approximately 50 per cent of the essential medicines that the United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund distributes in developing countries and 80 per cent of all medicines 
distributed by the International Dispensary Association were reportedly manufactured in 
India. A recent study emphasized India&#8217;s central role in generic medicines production 
especially with respect to HIV treatment. It concluded that about four million people started 
treatment between 2003 and 2008 using Indian generic drugs. It was alleged that such gains 
could be lost under the current terms of the draft FTA.  
</p>
<p>148. It was also reported that negotiations had thus far been closed to the public, and draft 
texts had not been made available to anyone beside select government officials. Finally, the 
negotiations also reportedly occurred without any public consultation with relevant 
stakeholders that might be affected by changes in intellectual property policy related to 
access to medicines.  
</p>
<p>149. Finally, it was alleged that the three Union Ministries &#8211; Health and Family Welfare, 
Commerce and Industry, and Chemicals and Fertilizers &#8211; rejected the proposal to change 
existing Indian patent and regulatory laws, stating that it would adversely impact public

inclusion of &#8220;TRIPS-plus&#8221; intellectual property provisions in the draft EU-India FTA. It 
was also reported that the Office had arrived at this decision after meeting with an 
international organization representing multinational pharmaceutical companies. Moreover, 
no human rights impact assessment had been undertaken with respect to the draft FTA. 
</p>
<p>150. Some of the &#8220;TRIPS-plus&#8221; provisions relating to intellectual property rights that 
were reportedly included in the negotiating text were as follows: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Patent-term extensions: Requiring India to provide an extension of patent terms 
through Supplementary Protection Certificates for products that require domestic 
regulatory approval. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Data exclusivity: Requiring India to create intellectual property protection for test 
data submitted to drug regulatory authorities for marketing approval by originator 
companies, and preventing use of that data for generic drug approval by the 
regulatory authority. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Border measures: Requiring India to provide for and agree to broader border 
measures that are likely to affect medicines in transit from India to other developing 
countries by giving customs authorities power to investigate goods in transit for 
intellectual property violations. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Enforcement Provisions: Requiring India to shift the burden of enforcement of 
private intellectual property rights to the State and utilise State resources to enforce 
private intellectual property rights, which would require amendments to existing 
Indian law.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Investment: Requiring many patents and other intellectual property rights to be 
considered &#8220;investments&#8221; subject to anti-expropriation measures. It is alleged that 
this would limit India&#8217;s ability to issue compulsory licenses.  
</p>
<p>151. Concern was expressed that the proposed EU&#8211;India free trade agreement could 
unduly limit the production of generic medicines in India, leading to a substantial reduction </p>

<p>in both the domestic and global supply of low-cost, high quality medicines for the most

some such &#8220;TRIPS-plus&#8221; provisions could restrict the ability of India to make use of 
flexibilities allowed under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property 
Rights (TRIPS).

mission to Indonesia, the Special Rapporteur on torture interviewed Mr. Karma on 15 
November 2007 at Abepura Prison (see A/HRC/7/3/Add.7, Appendix I, para. 30). 
</p>
<p>156. According to the information received, Mr. Filep Karma had been in detention in the 
province of Papua since December 2004. In August 2009, he complained of pain in the 
lower abdomen, difficulty in urinating and testicular swelling. He underwent medical tests, 
which indicated that he was suffering from bronchopneumonia, excess fluid in his lungs, a 
urinary tract infection and various other health problems. Despite the fact that the treating 
doctor recommended he receive additional treatment in Jakarta, he remained in Papua, as 
prison authorities indicated they lacked the funds to transfer and treat him. Mr. Karma had 
suffered from health problems before his arrest, but prison conditions aggravated his health 
condition. 
</p>
<p>157. Concern was expressed that Mr. Karma&#8217;s physical integrity may be at risk if he did 
not receive further medical attention. Particular concern was expressed regarding detention

<p>159. On <b>5 May 2010, </b>the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of 
the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the Special 
Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief sent a joint urgent appeal to the Government of 
Iran concerning Ayatollah Sayed Hossein Kazemeyni Boroujerdi, Iranian citizen, who has 
been the subject of joint urgent appeals dated 20 December 2006, 30 August 2007 and 3 
June 2009. In its response dated 14 February 2008, the Government of the Islamic Republic 
of Iran indicated that Mr. Boroujerdi had committed &quot;anti-Islamic teaching acts&quot; and that 
the Special Court for the Clergy had sentenced him in this context to ten years of 
imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>160. According to the new information received, Mr. Boroujerdi has spent approximately 
one year out of his prison sentence in solitary confinement at Evin Prison and Yazd Central 
Prison. During his detention, and particularly since January 2010, he has been subjected to 
various forms of ill-treatment, including apparent attacks on his life. From 22 to 27 April 
2010, he was held in solitary confinement in the &#8220;information ward&#8221;, as a punishment for 
speaking on the phone about the conditions and treatment at Evin Prison. During this time, 
the guards reportedly threatened to amputate both his hands if he spoke of the torture and 
ill-treatment he had been subjected to. It is also believed that on 27 April, several gases 
were diffused in his cell. As a result, Mr Boroujerdi was unable to stand easily, suffered 
from vertigo and vomiting, and had injuries on his vocal cords, forcing the guards to 
transfer him to the general ward. He has allegedly not received any medical attention and 
has been barred from receiving any visits. 
</p>
<p>161. In light of the allegations of torture and ill-treatment against Mr. Boroujerdi, as well 
as his urgent need for medical attention, concern was expressed for his physical and 
psychological integrity.

</p>
<p>165. According to the information received, Majid Tavakkoli was first arrested on 7 
December 2009 after he gave a speech at a student demonstration at Amir Kabir University 
in Tehran. He ended a seven-day hunger strike in protest for being placed in solitary </p>

<p>confinement when he was transferred to the general section of Evin Prison on 29 May 
</p><p>2010. However, on 22 June, he was transferred to Section 350, where the conditions were 
believed to be poor, with overcrowded cells, inadequate food and sanitary facilities. Mr. 
Tavakkoli suffered from a respiratory condition which worsened during his detention, and 
for which he had not received medical attention. 
</p>
<p>166. Mr. Tavakkoli was beaten upon arrest. Additionally, on 8 December 2009, Fars 
News Agency published pictures of Mr. Tavakkoli wearing women&#8217;s clothing, indicating 
he had been wearing them to avoid arrest. However, it is alleged that he was forced to wear 
the clothes to humiliate him.   
</p>
<p>167. His trial took place in January 2010, but his lawyer was not allowed to attend. Mr. 
Tavakkoli was sentenced to five years imprisonment for &#8220;participating in an illegal

<p>170. According to the information received, Ms. Sarah Emily Shourd was arrested on 31 
July 2009, together with two companions, by Iranian border guards near the Ahmed Awa 
waterfall resort area, Iraq. They were forced to cross the border to Iran, and Ms. Shourd 
was taken to Evin Prison, where she was still being held. Since her arrest, Ms. Shourd had 
been held in solitary confinement and without any charges brought against her. She had 
only received one family visit and she had had no access to her lawyer. In addition, she 
suffered from a precancerous condition on her cervix which needed to be monitored and 
treated, and she had recently found a lump on her breast. However, she had only seen a 
doctor once since her detention.

on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment<b> </b>sent a joint 
urgent appeal to the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic concerning the physical and

<p>Khalilov worked for more than 20 years as a professional journalist and now runs his own 
public relations firm, Flexi Communications, in the Kyrgyz Republic.   
</p>
<p>174. According to the information received, on 12 April 2010, members of the National 
Security Service arrested Mr. Khalilov shortly after a meeting with the Ambassador of the 
United Kingdom to Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic, and took him to their 
headquarters in Bishkek.  Since then, Mr. Khalilov has been reportedly held in solitary 
confinement.   
</p>
<p>175. According to reports received, Mr. Khalilov&#8217;s health has deteriorated since his 
detention and he is suffering from severe spinal hernia, which could paralyze him if not 
treated urgently.  In early May, a medical report stating the urgent need for treatment and 
comprehensive medical examination was submitted allegedly to the City Prosecutor of 
Bishkek and presented to the Government but reportedly no action has been taken.     
</p>
<p>176. Serious concern was expressed about the physical and mental integrity of Mr. 
Kahalilov and the allegations that his health had deteriorated severely after his detention.  
In this connection, very serious concern was expressed about allegations that Mr. Kahlikov 
was not receiving appropriate medical treatment without which he could face permanent 
disability.  Further concern was expressed about the allegations that Mr. Khalilov had been 
held in solitary confinement since his arrest.

appeal to the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic concerning Mr. Ulugbek Abdusalamov, 
an ethnic Uzbek journalist in detention in southern Kyrgyzstan. 
</p>
<p>179. According to the information received, Mr. Ulugbek Abdusalamov was detained on 
14 June on charges of &#8220;inciting ethnic hatred&#8221; under Article 299 of the Kyrgyzstani 
Criminal Code and transferred to a police detention centre in the town of Jalal-Abad two 
days later. Mr. Abdusalamov had a cerebral hemorrhage in 2009, suffered from high blood 
pressure, stomach ailments and a heart condition. On 29 June, he was transferred to a 
regional hospital after his lawyer filed six requests, but was later returned to police 
detention in Jalal-Abad. On 24 July, he was once again taken to the hospital upon his 
lawyer&#8217;s request, after his health continued to suffer. He was subsequently taken back to 
police detention, despite the fact that his condition was said to be very poor. Concern was 
expressed for the physical and physiological integrity of Mr. Ulugbek Abdusalamov, due to 
the lack of adequate medical attention.

<p>182. Following the deterioration of his health, Mr. Abdusalamov was transferred from 
remand custody to house arrest. Subsequently, the office of the Ombudsman of the Kyrgyz 
Republic received a letter from the president of the Central Asia PEN Centre requesting 
assistance in defending Mr. Abdusalamov and obtaining information on his situation, as 
information received indicated that he might have been subjected to torture and other ill-
treatment. 
</p>
<p>183. As a result staff of the Ombudsman&#8217;s office visited Mr. Abdusalamov on 9 
September 2010. He explained that his health deteriorated while in custody and in 
detention, and he stated that all his requests for medical assistance had been met, including 
being taken to a specialised medical ward when his condition worsened. He did not confirm 
the use of torture or other forms of coercion and had no complaints regarding food or his 
treatment.

</b></p>
<p>186. On <b>31 March 2010</b>, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur 
on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment sent a joint 
allegation letter to the Government of Mauritius regarding a speech given on Wednesday 24 
February 2010 at the launch of the National Policing Stategic Framework at the Paul 
Octave Wiehe Auditorium (University of Mauritius) by Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam, 
who allegedly pledged to reinstate the death penalty for drug offences, including for 
trafficking Subutex (buprenorphine). Subutex is a drug commonly used to treat opiate 
dependence, and is acknowledged as an essential medicine by the World Health 
Organization.   
</p>
<p>187. The Prime Minister allegedly warned people who are on prescription Subutex 
against travelling to Mauritius, due to plans to scale up enforcement relating to trafficking 
in the drug.  In his speech, the Prime Minister allegedly stated that: &#8220;We have to be severe. 
Subutex will not be allowed in the country. Even those who have to take Subutex under 
medical prescription will not be spared. It is better that they do not come to Mauritius on 
holidays with Subutex; they will have to face severe penalties&#8230;If you cannot live without 
Subutex, do not come to Mauritius. Go somewhere else.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>188. Although buprenorphine is not currently used as opioid substitution therapy (&#8216;OST&#8217;) 
in Mauritius &#8211; Methadone being primarily used instead &#8211; any proposed restrictions and 
penalties on use and possession of buprenorphine in Mauritius would constitute a 
significant infringement of the right to health for nationals of Mauritius, as well as visitors 
to the country.  Additionally, the alleged proposal concerning imposition of the death 
penalty represents an infringement of other rights, including the right to life.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response received 
</b></p>
<p>189. On<b> 22 June 2010</b> the Government of Mauritius replied to the allegation letter sent 
on 31 March 2010. It indicated that the Prime Minister of the Republic of Mauritius was </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>29 
</b></p>
<p>committed to fighting crime and especially of violent and heinous crimes. As a result the 
reintroduction of the death penalty had to be seen in that perspective and would be 
considered as a measure of last resort, applied to extreme circumstances and would respect 
necessary safeguards.  The Government stated that so far no legislative action with the goal 
of reintroducing death penalty or to affect those arriving in the country with Buprenorphine 
prescriptions (Subutex) had been initiated. In any case, any decision to review legislation 
regarding the death penalty would be subject to normal consultative processes.  
</p>
<p>190. The Government provided extra information on national legislation and policy. In 
August 2008, the Dangerous Drugs Act 2000 was amended to provide for tougher penalties 
in respect of offenses dealing with Subutex. A person who unlawfully possesses sells or 
distributes subutex may be liable to prosecution.  The law provides for the use of subutex 
for medical purposes in quantities not exceeding those strictly required for the purpose in 
question.  
</p>
<p>191. The right to health ranked very high in the economic and social development agenda 
of the Government of Mauritius and in this context the Government of Mauritius continued 
to maintain the welfare system including access to free and quality health system to all. 
</p>
<p>192. The Government indicated that a National Day Care Centre for the Immuno-
Suppressed had been set up to provide treatment, care and support to people living with 
HIV/AIDS including drug users and sex workers, free of charge. The Government added 
that the HIV and AIDS Act that came into force in 2007 provided an effective legal 
framework to eliminate all forms of discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS. 
The Government emphasized the role of NGOs: the National Agency for the Treatment and 
Rehabilitation of Substance abusers worked in close cooperation with civil society. NGOs 
also addressed the psychosocial and psychological needs of drug users and acted as a 
watchdog to prevent discrimination against them.

the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar and the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of racism sent an urgent appeal to the Government of Myanmar 
regarding two detainees who were in need of urgent medical care and appeared to be denied 
access to it.  
</p>
<p>201. Ma Khin Khin Nu was being detained in Insein Prison where she fell ill and was in 
urgent need of medical attention. According to the information received, when she first 
started feeling unwell the medical staff in Insein Prison provided some medication that only 
worsened her condition. Since then, Ma Khin Khin Nu had not received any other treatment 
nor had she been examined further. She had not been given permission to get treatment 
outside of the prison. Aside from this illness, she was also reported to be suffering from a 
range of ailments including skin boils and lice.  
</p>
<p>202. Information received suggested that Ma Khin Khin Nu was sentenced to 17 years 
imprisonment in 2005 for supposedly giving false information about her ethnicity in order 
to get citizenship in Myanmar along with other members of her family. Ma Khin Khin Nu 
and her family members including father U Kyaw Min were all born in Myanmar and have 
been lifelong residents. In 2005, after Kyaw Min joined other elected members of 
parliament to call for the legislature to be allowed to sit, and after meeting with </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>31 
</b></p>
<p>representatives of the International Labour Organisation visiting Yangon, it is believed that 
officials accused Kyaw Min and his family of lying about their ethnicity and falsely 
obtaining citizenship, accusing them of being Bengali rather than nationals of Myanmar. 
Five members of Ma Khin Khin Nu&#8217;s family were charged under section 18 of the 1982 
Citizenship Act that, &quot;A citizen who has acquired citizenship by making a false 
representation or by concealment shall have his citizenship revoked, and shall also be liable 
to imprisonment for a term of ten years and to a fine of kyats fifty thousand&quot; and under the 
1950 Emergency Regulations. Kyaw Min did not have a lawyer in court and explained that 
his family is Rohingya but because this is not an officially recognized ethnic group they had 
complied with designations of ethnicity determined by officials at the time. However, the 
court rejected this argument and found them guilty of lying about their identity. A lawyer 
lodged appeals for Kyaw Min and his family at the Yangon Divisional Court and Supreme 
Court on a range of grounds pointing to the factual and procedural flaws in the original 
case; however, the courts successively dismissed the appeals without considering the 
substance of the appeals at all and merely restating what had already been decided in the 
lower-level court.  
</p>
<p>203. We had also received information that Ko Mya Aye, who was being detained at 
Taungyi Prison in Shan State and was one of the leaders of 88 Generation Students Group, 
was being denied access to proper medical treatment that he urgently needed for a heart 
condition. Ko Mya Aye appeared to be suffering from angina which had become unstable 
causing heart failure and requiring urgent medical treatment. He was also said to be 
suffering from hypertension and gastric problems. The medical tests he required could 
apparently only be done in Yangon.  On 9 April 2010, he was moved from Loikaw Prison 
in Karenni State to Taungyi Prison in Shan State. Both prisons were far from emergency 
medical care he would have needed if he had had another heart attack, as well as for his 
family to make regular visits.  Furthermore, the conditions under which Ko Mya Aye was 
being held, in a cell intended for death row prisoners without a toilet or running water, and 
where he was denied any exercise were believed to contribute to his ill-health. 
</p>
<p>204. In August 2007, Ko Mya Aye was among the 14 leaders of the 88 Generation 
Students Group arrested, reportedly without warrants. In November 2008, Ko Mya Aye 
received a sentence of 65 years in a closed court at Insein Prison for violation of the 
Electronic Funds Transfer Law and the Organization of Association Law.

<p>205. On <b>8 July 2010</b>, the Government of Myanmar replied to the urgent appeal sent on 6 
May 2010.  
</p>
<p>206. It indicated that Mya Aye had been transferred from Loikaw Prison to Taungy in 
order to provide him proper medical care. Since his arrival there he has received proper 
medical care by a medical team supervised by Dr. Nay Lynn Tun and Dr. Hla Thein. The 
government added that since the authorities had not received any complaint about the 
treatment of the victim, no investigation had been undertaken.  
</p>
<p>207. With regard to Khin Khin Nu, the Government indicated that she has received 
proper medical care by several doctors ever since her arrival at Insein Prison. No 
complaints had been received regarding her treatment and as a result no investigation was 
undertaken regarding her case either.

<p><b>  New Zealand 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>209. On <b>28 December 2010</b> the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health sent an 
allegation letter to the Government of New Zealand regarding rejections of visa 
applications of persons living with HIV/AIDS for temporary stay in New Zealand.  
</p>
<p>210. According to the information received, pending the approval process of visa 
applications, applicants for temporary entry (longer than six months) to New Zealand must 
reportedly be evaluated by Immigration New Zealand to determine whether applicants were 
of &#8220;acceptable standard of health&#8221;. It was alleged that applications for entry from persons 
living with HIV/AIDS were rejected on the basis of their health status and because those 
applicants were &#8220;likely to impose significant costs or demands on New Zealand&#8217;s health 
services&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>211. It was reported that, in some cases, applicants living with HIV were given 
opportunity to comment on the initial medical assessment. It was alleged that, having 
provided additional information of stable health condition and financial viability, they were 
still denied entry visa to New Zealand or were asked to apply for a medical waiver, for 
which they were ineligible. 
</p>
<p>212. Concern was expressed about the alleged discrimination against persons who are 
living with HIV/AIDS on the basis of their unsuitability to meet the &#8220;acceptable health 
standard&#8221; requirement of the New Zealand immigration policy.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response received 
</b></p>
<p>213. On <b>28 February 2011</b>, the Government of New Zealand replied to the allegation 
letter sent on 28 December 2010. It replied to the questions asked by the Special 
Rapporteur and it indicated that New Zealand did not discriminate against people living 
with HIV/AIDS with regard to visa applications. In particular, the Government specified 
that New Zealand did not have a blanket ban on entry to New Zealand for people with 
HIV/AIDS, with the exception of the Recognized Seasonal employer scheme for 
horticultural and viticulture industries, which effectively excludes applicants with both 
tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. 
</p>
<p>214. Instead, HIV/AIDS is treated like any other medical condition, with visa 
determinations being made on an individualised basis, taking into account several factors 
such as anticipated costs of care. The Government indicated that medical conditions 
including HIV/AIDS did not override human rights obligations.  
</p>
<p>215. In order to obtain a visa in the New Zealand, an applicant must have an acceptable 
standard of health except in the following three situations:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; the applicant is entering New Zealand for specific medical treatment and is granted a 
visa for this purpose 
</p>
<p>&#8226; the applicant is granted a waiver (if he has family in New Zealand, or if he has been 
granted refugee status) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; if an exception is applied to policy when the applicant is not eligible for waiver. 
</p>
<p>216. A person is determined to have an acceptable standard of health when he/she is 
unlikely to be a danger to public health, unlikely to impose significant costs or demands on 
New Zealand&#8217;s health services or special education services, and when he/she is applying 
for a visa to undertake work or study and is able to undertake that work or study. A &#8220;stable&#8221; 
health condition may or may not qualify as an acceptable standard of health. An applicant </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>33 
</b></p>
<p>whose health is stable but only through ongoing hospital or high cost pharmaceutical care 
may not, for that reason, present an acceptable standard of health. Besides, the Government 
added that financial viability is generally not considered in assessing the medical condition 
of applicants since health care in New Zealand is accessible to all. As a result the 
Government does not rely on financial viability in its immigration policy. 
</p>
<p>217. New Zealand&#8217;s approach to health assessment is the following. Visa applications for 
periods of less than one year require a declaration by the applicant as to their medical 
conditions. Any serious medical condition needs to be declared, but there is no specific 
reference to HIV status or provisions for HIV-positive applicants. 
</p>
<p>218. Applicants who intend to be in New Zealand for more than one year must provide a 
medical and X-ray certificate from a doctor who has been approved by Immigration New 
Zealand (INZ). The assessment covers current or previous health conditions including 
HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, typhoid, hepatitis etc. 
</p>
<p>219. Where INZ becomes aware that an applicant applying for a temporary visa is not of 
an acceptable standard of health, it suggests that the applicants provide additional 
information prior to a decision on their application if they wish to. If upon  receiving further 
information from the applicant, INZ still believed that applicant does not meet health 
criteria, the applicant will be advised of the options applicable to their situation. These 
options can be to either seek a medical waiver, if the applicant is eligible (HIV/AIDS status 
is irrelevant to eligibility to seek a waiver), or to request INZ to make an exception to the 
policy.  
</p>
<p>220. The waiver procedure is available to some family members of people residing in 
New Zealand and certain other categories of applicants. Medical waiver decisions are made 
in consultation with the applicant and medical assessors include several considerations, 
such as the degree to which the applicant would impose significant costs on New Zealand 
health services, the significance of the applicant&#8217;s potential contribution to New Zealand, 
the length of the intended stay etc. 
</p>
<p>221. The Government added that HIV/AIDS applicants are treated in the same way as 
applicants with any other health conditions. 
</p>
<p>222. With regard to people having been granted asylum in New Zealand the Government 
indicated that they can benefit from a waiver to the requirement of an acceptable standard 
of health. New Zealand has however agreed with UNHCR that in resettling UNCHR-
determined refugees in New Zealand, UNHCHR will request resettlement of such refugees 
who are HIV-positive to a maximum of 20 people each year out of a total of 750. This limit 
was created in order to maintain New Zealand&#8217;s resettlement programme while also 
managing impacts on New Zealand&#8217;s health services.  
</p>
<p>223. The Government also indicated that the Minister of Immigration has directed 
officials to undertake a review of immigration health screening settings, covering the 
threshold for being considered to be of an acceptable standard of health as well as some 
specific issues such as RSE applicants who are HIV positive. 
</p>
<p>224. With regard to individual complaints, the Government replied that it was not 
possible to comment on individual cases for reasons of privacy. However, immigration 
decisions are subject to rights of reconsideration, appeal and/or complaint, including where 
appropriate through the New Zealand courts and/or through administrative review 
procedures. Where complaints are upheld, remedies in such cases can involve the reversal 
of adverse decisions and other measures.  
</p>
<p>225. Finally, the Government of New Zealand outlined the steps taken to ensure the right 
the highest attainable standard of health for people living with HIV/AIDS. Firstly, New 
Zealand has express legal prohibitions against discrimination including on the grounds of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>34</b> 
</p>
<p>HIV/AIDS. Complaints of discrimination may be pursued through the New Zealand Human 
Rights Commission, through the Health and Disability Services Commissioner and/or, 
where necessary, through legal proceedings. In some cases publicly funded legal 
representation is available for such proceedings. 
</p>
<p>226. Secondly, extensive public health care, social assistance and other support is 
provided as necessary to people living with HIV/AIDS in New Zealand. Public spending on 
antiretroviral medication is significant. Peer support organisations also provide support and 
advocacy for people living with HIV/AIDS. A comprehensive review of services provided 
to people living with HIV/AIDS was completed in November 2010 and is available at 
www.moh.govt.nz. New Zealand also undertakes substantial health information campaigns 
through public funding of non-governmental organisations. Needle exchange programmes 
have been established to reduce infection amongst injecting drug users. The New Zealand 
Prostitutes Collective provides health promotion and support services for sex workers.

de produits et d&#233;chets toxiques et nocifs pour la jouissance des droits de l&#8217;homme a envoy&#233; 
une lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation <b>c</b>oncernant des mines d&#8217;uranium dans la r&#233;gion nord-ouest de la 
province d&#8217;Agadez pouvant avoir des effets nocifs ainsi qu&#8217;un impact continu sur la 
jouissance des droits &#233;conomiques, sociaux et culturels des communaut&#233;s affect&#233;es, 
particuli&#232;rement dans la r&#233;gion autour des villes mini&#232;res d&#8217;Arlit et d&#8217;Akokan. 
</p>
<p>229. Il a &#233;t&#233; apport&#233; &#224; notre attention qu&#8217;autour des villes d&#8217;Arlit et d&#8217;Akokan, des 
m&#233;thodes d&#8217;exploitation ainsi qu&#8217;une mauvaise gestion de l&#8217;industrie mini&#232;re d&#8217;uranium 
op&#233;r&#233;e par la soci&#233;t&#233; AREVA causeraient une pollution de grande envergure, 
endommageraient l&#8217;&#233;cosyst&#232;me de mani&#232;re d&#233;finitive et pourraient &#233;galement causer des 
probl&#232;mes de sant&#233; &#224; la population locale. La pollution caus&#233;e par l&#8217;industrie mini&#232;re 
inclurait : la contamination de l&#8217;eau, l&#8217;&#233;puisement des r&#233;serves des nappes phr&#233;atiques de la 
r&#233;gion ainsi que la contamination de l&#8217;air et du sol. Les effets de cette contamination 
incluraient &#233;galement : la d&#233;sertification acc&#233;l&#233;r&#233;e et la r&#233;duction de la terre &#224; p&#226;turage, 
ainsi qu&#8217;une pr&#233;valence plus &#233;lev&#233;e des maladies respiratoires, leuc&#233;mies, cancers et 
malformations &#224; la naissance. 
</p>
<p>230. Sp&#233;cifiquement, selon l&#8217;information re&#231;ue, les m&#233;thodes de l&#8217;exploitation mini&#232;re 
contribueraient &#224; la pollution de trois mani&#232;res : 
</p>
<p>231. En premier lieu, le processus de lixiviation de l&#8217;uranium par lequel l&#8217;eau est utilis&#233;e 
quotidiennement pour s&#233;parer l&#8217;uranium du min&#233;ral, aurait d&#233;j&#224; vid&#233; plus de 270 milliards 
de litres d&#8217;eau de l&#8217;aquif&#232;re local et l&#8217;aurait enti&#232;rement &#233;puis&#233; dans quelques r&#233;gions. La 
r&#233;duction d&#8217;approvisionnement en eau menace les communaut&#233;s locales notamment les 
gardiens de troupeaux nomades, par la r&#233;duction des terres fertiles pour leur b&#233;tail. De plus, 
des puits d&#8217;eau ouverts et des mines d&#8217;uranium croisent l&#8217;aquif&#232;re ce qui,  par cons&#233;quence, 
a caus&#233; la lib&#233;ration d&#8217;un haut niveau de mat&#233;riaux radioactifs, entrant et circulant dans 
l&#8217;aquif&#232;re. Etant donn&#233; que l&#8217;aquif&#232;re est la premi&#232;re source d&#8217;eau potable, les risques 
sanitaires li&#233;s &#224; la contamination peuvent augmenter. Les informations que nous avons </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>35 
</b></p>
<p>re&#231;ues indiquent qu&#8217;une majorit&#233; de puits identifi&#233;s contiennent une concentration de 
contaminants radioactifs d&#233;passant la limite recommand&#233;e par l&#8217;Organisation Mondiale de 
la Sant&#233; (OMS) pour l&#8217;eau potable.  
</p>
<p>232. En deuxi&#232;me lieu,  il est &#224; noter que la gestion du processus d&#8217;extraction se traduit 
par la lib&#233;ration et la propagation dans l&#8217;air de substances radioactives, et augmente les 
risques de contracter des maladies respiratoires. Le forage de mines,  les d&#233;tonations, les 
montagnes de boue et les d&#233;chets industriels - &#224; ciel ouvert-, et la lib&#233;ration du gaz radon 
provoquent des nuages de poussi&#232;re qui sont les premi&#232;res sources de cette pollution. Ces 
polluants, accumul&#233;s dans le sol et &#224; la surface des v&#233;g&#233;tations, exposent la sant&#233; des 
habitants de la r&#233;gion &#224; des risques li&#233;s &#224; l&#8217;inhalation et &#224; la consommation d&#8217;aliments issus 
de l&#8217;agriculture locale. Le taux des infections respiratoires dans les villes d&#8217;Arlit et Akokan 
serait deux fois plus &#233;lev&#233; que la moyenne nationale. Par ailleurs, l&#8217;eau utilis&#233;e par les 
soci&#233;t&#233;s mini&#232;res pour arroser les routes dans le but de contrer la poussi&#232;re est contamin&#233;e 
par l&#8217;uranium. Ce dernier pourrait s&#8217;accumuler sur les routes.  
</p>
<p>233. En troisi&#232;me lieu, la disposition des d&#233;chets et ferrailles m&#233;talliques contribuerait 
&#233;galement &#224; la pollution de la r&#233;gion. Les roches st&#233;riles restantes apr&#232;s l&#8217;extraction de 
l&#8217;uranium sont souvent laiss&#233;es &#224; l&#8217;air sur des piles o&#249; celles-ci pourraient &#233;mettre des 
contaminations et de la poussi&#232;re dans l&#8217;environnement. De plus, les roches st&#233;riles seraient 
souvent utilis&#233;es pour la construction de routes locales, engendrant un niveau &#233;lev&#233; de 
radiations dangereuses pour la sant&#233;. Finalement, la ferraille contamin&#233;e et l&#8217;&#233;quipement 
utilis&#233; pour extraire le minerai d&#8217;uranium se trouveraient sur les march&#233;s r&#233;gionaux et 
poseraient un grave risque de sant&#233; &#224; quiconque entrerait en contact avec ceux-ci. 
</p>
<p>234. En outre, il semblerait que la soci&#233;t&#233; mini&#232;re AREVA et ses filiales n&#8217;informeraient 
pas leurs employ&#233;s et la population locale sur les risques encourus par la proximit&#233; 
physique et par le travail autour des mines d&#8217;uranium. Sp&#233;cifiquement, les employ&#233;s et les 
sous-traitants engag&#233;s par la soci&#233;t&#233; multinationale, ne disposeraient que rarement de 
l&#8217;&#233;quipement de protection requis contre le rayonnement, comme des dosim&#232;tres ou des 
masques. De m&#234;me, la population locale ne serait pas consciente du danger reli&#233; &#224; 
l&#8217;exploitation des mines d&#8217;uranium. 
</p>
<p>235. Il a aussi &#233;t&#233; apport&#233; &#224; notre attention que la soci&#233;t&#233; mini&#232;re AREVA et ses filiales 
ne r&#233;agiraient pas de fa&#231;on appropri&#233;e aux accidents, tel que les d&#233;versements importants 
d&#8217;uranium lors de son transport, ce qui provoquerait par cons&#233;quence la contamination et la 
d&#233;gradation de l&#8217;&#233;cosyst&#232;me. La compagnie responsable d&#8217;un accident d&#251; au renversement 
d&#8217;un des camions qui transportait de l&#8217;uranium au B&#233;nin, aurait pris plus d&#8217;un mois pour 
commencer les op&#233;rations de nettoyage. 
</p>
<p>236. Finalement, il a &#233;t&#233; rapport&#233; que les anciens travailleurs ne seraient pas admis dans 
les h&#244;pitaux des soci&#233;t&#233;s mini&#232;res, notamment lorsque les maux dont ils souffrent peuvent 
avoir &#233;t&#233; caus&#233;s par leur travail dans les mines. De plus, les h&#244;pitaux ne disposeraient pas 
de m&#233;decins professionnels comp&#233;tents pour traiter les maladies li&#233;es aux accidents de 
travail, et par cons&#233;quent il serait impossible de diagnostiquer un patient souffrant  d&#8217;une 
maladie li&#233;e au travail, comme le cancer ou d&#8217;autres maladies li&#233;es &#224; l&#8217;exposition au 
rayonnement. Les h&#244;pitaux falsifieraient les statistiques des cas de cancer en pr&#233;tendant 
qu&#8217;il s&#8217;agirait de cas de VIH ou de malaria afin de maintenir un taux bas de cancer dans les 
rapports des soci&#233;t&#233;s mini&#232;res.

communication au moment de la finalisation du rapport. </p>

<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>238. On <b>22 March 2010</b>, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and 
the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on arbitrary detentions sent a joint urgent 
appeal regarding Mr. Leiv Hodne, born on 1 November 1980, currently confined at Oslo 
University Hospital, Ullev&#229;l, Psychiatric division, Acute unit, Post 5.  
</p>
<p>239. According to the information received: Since 15 January 2010, Mr. Leiv Hodne has 
been involuntarily committed to the psychiatric unit of Oslo University Hospital. He was 
retrieved by the police while sleeping in a hotel room, without being in any acute danger of 
his life or health.  
</p>
<p>240. Mr. Hodne has been diagnosed with OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder). While 
he develops a deep anxiety in certain situations, he has no history of violent or other 
disturbing behaviour of any kind, and has never been a threat or danger to himself or 
anyone else. He can take care of himself, but because of his anxiety and psychosocial 
disability he needs some accommodation and care to fulfill some basic needs, such as being 
able to eat and drink. Prior to his confinement to the hospital, he was eating and drinking on 
a daily basis and was in good physical health and well nourished, even though his life 
situation was rather difficult.  
</p>
<p>241. However, after the confinement, he was reportedly denied reasonable 
accommodation to eat and drink at the University Hospital. Because of the denial of such 
accommodation, he was this time totally without food and liquid for more than nine days, 
and lost more than 11.5 kilos in this period.  
</p>
<p>242. As a consequence, Mr. Hodne has been subject to different interventions which the 
medical personal of the hospital reportedly administrated due to &#8220;the need for medical 
treatment&#8221; and a &#8220;necessity due to an emergency situation&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>243. On 25 January 2010, ten days after his confinement, he was given water 
intravenously to prevent total dehydration, a situation that could very shortly have led to his 
death.  
</p>
<p>244. Since 2 February, Mr. Hodne has been force-fed by a tube in his nose. In the days 
preceding this, Mr. Hodne was able to drink nutritional drinks (yoghurt, juice, and soup). 
Mr. Hodne wanted to continue drinking on his own, but instead he was strapped down and 
the tube was inserted with physical force. His private doctor, Dr. Coucheron, stated in a 
letter to the Regional Board of Health Supervision, dated 2 February 2010, that &#8220;the forced 
feeding with a tube was carried through with the use of restraints and up to 10 health 
professionals holding the patient down while the tube was inserted into his stomach&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>245. The hospital staff members have increasingly restricted Mr. Hodne&#8217;s communication 
with the outside world. On 1 February 2010, the hospital confiscated Mr. Hodne&#8217;s 
telephone and denied him of all contact external to the hospital, with the exception of his 
lawyer. Mr. Hodne&#8217;s father is allowed to communicate with his son only through the 
attorney and the hospital staff.  
</p>
<p>246. On 17 January 2010, Mr. Hodne&#8217;s father reported the case to the police, alleging 
illegal deprivation of liberty, but the case was dismissed by the police authorities.  
</p>
<p>247. On 16 February 2010, a complaint to the Control Commission was filed by both Mr. 
Hodne and his father on the decision on deprivation of liberty (compulsory mental health 
care). On 22 February 2010, the Commission decided that Mr. Hodne will continue to be </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>37 
</b></p>
<p>kept under involuntary admission. The decision is now being taken to court. The case is 
pending and no date has yet been set for the trial.  
</p>
<p>248. Mr. Hodne was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital for the first time on 
2 July 2009 after he had asked for help and support from the health care system.  
</p>
<p>249. During the first psychiatric confinement, Mr. Hodne managed to escape from the 
hospital after seven days. For 16 days he and his father were on the run in Sweden, until 
Mr. Hodne was brought back to the hospital by the police 26 July 2009. He was released 
from the hospital 29 July 2009. 
</p>
<p>250. Concern was expressed at the involuntary commitment of Mr. Hodne to the 
University Hospital without his free and informed consent, the lack of provision of 
reasonable accommodation and the medical interventions applied.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response received 
</b></p>
<p>251. On <b>22 December 2010</b> the Government of Norway replied to the joint urgent appeal 
sent on 22 March 2010. It sent Act No. 62 of 2 July 1999 relating to the provision and 
implementation of mental health care (the Mental Health Care Act), with later amendments. 
This legislation contains provisions regarding the professionals responsible for 
administrative decisions; the patient&#8217;s right to a lawyer or other agent; consent (notably

<p>253. On <b>2 July 2010 </b>the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of 
the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health sent an urgent appeal to the 
government of Pakistan regarding cessation of provision of HIV services to injecting drug 
users in Punjab.  
</p>
<p>254. According to the information received, the Punjab AIDS Control Program (PACP), 
a HIV prevention programme initiated by the Punjab Department of Health in four cities, 
allegedly had been discontinued. Many considered the PACP, which operated in a public-
private collaboration with Nai Zindagi Trust, a regional best-practice example, including by 
the United Nations, World Bank and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and 
Malaria. It allegedly had been successfully in preventing, halting and reserving the growing 
HIV epidemic in four cities of the Punjab, as evaluated by the Canada-Pakistan HIV/AIDS 
Surveillance Project, an independent programme supported by the Governments of Pakistan 
and Canada to monitor HIV prevalence and risk behaviours in Pakistan. 
</p>
<p>255. The PACP was allegedly the only HIV prevention programme for drug users that the 
World Bank was willing to support in Pakistan because of the quality of service provided 
through its interventions, which included syringe exchange services, health care, condom 
provision, treatment and prevention of sexually transmitted infections, counselling, drug 
treatment, and rehabilitation. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>38</b> 
</p>
<p>256. Between April 2009 to March 2010, Nai Zindagi Trust allegedly established such 
services in eight cities, and completed assessments to increase interventions in another four 
cities, providing services to over 14,000 clients.  However, in May 2010, the contract to 
provide these services allegedly was terminated by PACP with no reasons given for the 
termination. It had been alleged that the primary reason for the termination was Nai 
Zindagi&#8217;s refusal to provide personal details of its beneficiaries, in accordance with the 
contractual obligation of non-disclosure of personal details included in the initial 
agreement. 
</p>
<p>257. Allegedly, the World Bank had requested that the Secretary of Health of the Punjab 
Department of Health release payment for services rendered by Nai Zindagi, withdraw the 
cancellation of the contract, and cease requests for identifying information of beneficiaries.  
However, the cancellation allegedly remained in effect, despite repeated requests for 
reinstatement by the World Bank, and the Department of Health allegedly was maintaining 
its request to be provided with the personal information of beneficiaries of these 
programmes. 
</p>
<p>258. Despite allegedly not receiving payments for services already rendered, Nai Zindagi 
Trust continued to provide services in Punjab until May 2010, but since that time allegedly 
had discontinued providing services altogether. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response received 
</b></p>
<p>259. On <b>6 July 2010, </b>the Government of Pakistan replied to the urgent appeal sent on 2 
July 2010. 
</p>
<p>260. Firstly, the Government indicated that it considered that covering issues of 
routine/administrative nature did not fall within the mandate of the Special Rapporteur and 
that it was against the spirit of the mechanism of urgent appeals. The Government 
considered that urgent appeals were used in cases where the alleged violations were time-
sensitive, life-threatening situations, which was not the case here. 
</p>
<p>261. Secondly, the Government reiterated its commitment to the obligations in the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and to the right to the 
highest attainable standard of physical and mental health within available resources. It 
reminded the Rapporteur of its reservation to the aforementioned international covenant 
which states that Pakistan shall use all appropriate means to the maximum of its available 
resources with a view of achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized 
in the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>262. Thirdly, the Government added that even though they did not believe that the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate allowed him to comment or interfere in Pakistan&#8217;s 
administrative issues, they would nevertheless request information on the case and keep the 
Rapporteur informed.

circumcised. Some of the boys photographed were covering their faces to conceal their 
identities. Details of the photographs indicated that the circumcisions were conducted in a 
public place, possibly at schools. It was alleged that the pictures were taken and published 
on the Internet without the consent of the boys involved.

<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>272. On<b> 25 June 2010, </b>the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment 
of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government of the Russian Federation concerning the treatment of people living with HIV 
and tuberculosis who are undergoing drug dependency treatment at the Tuberculosis Clinic 
located at 37 Kamskaya St., Yekaterinburg, Sverdlovsk Oblast, Russia. 
</p>
<p>273. According to the information received, patients with HIV, tuberculosis (hereafter 
&#8216;TB&#8217;) and drug dependency undergoing treatment at the Tuberculosis Clinic in 
Yekaterinburg, Sverdlovsk Oblast, Russia were allegedly being mistreated in a number of 
ways.  Allegedly, complaints had been submitted to the Ministry of Health of Sverdlovsk 
Oblast by civil society groups and individual patients. 
</p>
<p>274. Since the beginning of 2010, many basic necessities had allegedly not been provided 
to the patients. The food provision to patients of the hospital had allegedly worsened, so 
much so that the quality of nutrition did not meet the requirements for patients with HIV, 
TB, and other diseases. Additionally, for two weeks in April, there had been reportedly no 
hot water provision at the hospital.  Heating had also allegedly been turned off for one week 
in the beginning of April. 
</p>
<p>275. Allegedly, there were no intensive therapy wards in the hospital, and no palliative 
care was available. Patients were also reportedly required to buy syringes and other medical 
equipment for medical procedures. 
</p>
<p>276. Effective in-patient TB treatment was practically impossible for people with HIV 
who were also dependent on opiates, because drug detoxification services were unavailable 
prior to TB treatment. Therefore, when patients checked into the hospital they were often in 
the state of opiate withdrawal, for which treatment was unavailable. Patients who 
repeatedly left the hospital in order to procure illicit drugs allegedly risked being discharged 
before the end of treatment because of disciplinary sanctions. According to standards of 
drug treatment, approved by the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, an opiate 
analgesic Tramadol can be prescribed for such treatment. However, it wass reportedly not 
available in the TB clinic. Internationally recommended opioid substitution therapy with 
methadone and buprenorphine is illegal in the Russian Federation, and therefore was not 
provided in the clinic.   
</p>
<p>277. Moreover, it was alleged that people living with HIV and TB had not received 2nd 
line medications for treatment of drug-resistant TB. Allegedly, no additional medicines had 
been provided in the hospital (for example, supportive liver therapy, as many people with 
HIV and TB also have hepatitis C virus: &#8216;HCV&#8217;). Generally in Oblast, international 
minimum standards of hepatitis C treatment with pegylated interferons and ribavirin were 
not available.  
</p>
<p>278. Additionally, there were allegedly no infectious disease consultants or drug 
treatment specialists working in the TB hospital, so their services were unavailable for </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>41 
</b></p>
<p>people with co-morbidities. For instance, patients with HIV who received inpatient 
treatment in the TB hospital allegedly were not referred to an infectious diseases consultant 
for management of their HIV, and were not afforded testing for their immune status and 
viral load. Patients on HIV antiretroviral treatment at the time allegedly could not receive 
their necessary medication within the TB hospital. Therefore patients, even with active 
forms of TB or other life-threatening illnesses, reportedly had to travel to the AIDS center 
for their monitoring, consultations, and anti retroviral drugs. 
</p>
<p>279. There was also reportedly no social worker at the TB hospital. Their assistance was 
crucial, since many patients allegedly came from marginalized groups, including ex-
prisoners and populations using drugs, and lack documents and housing. Therefore, after 
treatment, many patients found themselves out on the streets, where their health condition 
worsened and effective treatment became impossible due to social factors. 
</p>
<p>280. Following submissions of the complaints to the Ministry, civil society groups 
organized a press conference where the chief doctor of TB service, Igor Zykov, and chief 
doctor of the AIDS service, Anjelika Podymova, were allegedly present. Subsequently, the 
water supply was allegedly restored at the hospital, and patients were promised that tests for 
immune status and viral load would be provided within the hospital, and antiretroviral 
medicine would be made available within the hospital.  
</p>
<p>281. Reportedly, around the same time in April 2010, the hospital administration made a 
decision to make the hospital a &#8216;closed&#8217; facility, which allegedly meant that patients were 
not allowed to leave the hospital building for the duration of treatment (90 days in average), 
and were kept in detention-like conditions. Previously, people who were dependent on 
drugs could leave the hospital and acquire drugs. Now, approximately 15 patients in this 
closed facility were allegedly experiencing withdrawal syndrome and did not have access to 
any drug dependence treatment, and had been warned that should they violate the treatment 
regimen, and leave the hospital, they would not be allowed to return to the treatment facility 
and would be left without care. 
</p>
<p>282. Additionally, the hospital administration allegedly harassed patients, including those 
experiencing active drug withdrawal syndromes, and coerced them into writing letters to 
the Oblast Ministry of Health to withdraw their previous complaints. 
</p>

<p>284. On<b> 23 December 2010</b>, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health sent an 
allegation letter to the Government of the Russian Federation regarding interruptions in 
anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment of nineteen people living with HIV/AIDS and an extreme 
shortage of essential ARV drugs across the Russian Federation in 2010. 
</p>
<p>285. According to the information received, it was alleged that nineteen Russian citizens 
from eight regions living with HIV/AIDS suffered from interruptions in their ARV 
treatment due to unavailability of drugs in 2010. It was also alleged that there had been 
major, documented delays in delivery and shortage of essential ARV drugs in health-care 
facilities in Arkhangelsk, Kaliningrad, Moscow, Moscow Region, St. Petersburg, Samara, 
Saratov, Tula, Ulyanovsk, Vladimir and other regions of the Russian Federation. It was 
further alleged that interruptions in ARV treatment of one month or longer were reported in 
fifteen prisons.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>42</b> 
</p>
<p>286. Reportedly, despite the interruptions in ARV treatment and the resulting changes in 
treatment regimen, the official statement from the Ministry of Health and Social 
Development of 16 September 2010 denied that shortages in drugs were evident in most of 
the regions of the Russian Federation.  
</p>
<p>287. It was also alleged that people who used drugs were required to go through more 
complicated procedures to begin receiving ARV treatment, and that, in some cases, persons 
who did not receive treatment were incarcerated, often for the use of drugs. 
</p>

<p>289. On<b> 23 December 2010</b>, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health sent an 
allegation letter to the Government of the Russian Federation concerning the prohibition of 
access to effective methods of drug treatment. 
</p>
<p>290. According to the information received, it was alleged that drug-dependence 
treatment programs in penitentiary, public and private health facilities in the Russian 
Federation required immediate and permanent cessation of drug use, which had proved to 
be ineffective in many cases, impeding long-term rehabilitation of persons who used drugs. 
It was alleged that persons who used drugs were continuously denied Opioid Substitution 
Treatment (OST). It was further alleged that the unavailability of OST had prevented those 
persons from accessing and using the effective method of treatment against drug 
dependence and led to the deterioration of their state of health.  
</p>
<p>291. Reportedly, in many cases, due to the provision of ineffective treatment and the 
resulting relapses after such treatments, persons who used drugs were imprisoned for 
committing drug-related offences. During those terms in prison, they allegedly underwent 
compulsory drug-dependence treatment but tended to relapse almost immediately after 
release from prison.  
</p>
<p>292. As a result of unsafe injecting drug use, persons who used drugs could contract 
Hepatitis C and HIV/AIDS. It was alleged that the absence of OST to drug-dependant 
patients, who were treated for Tuberculosis, Hepatitis C and HIV, often forced them to 
break their regiment to avoid withdrawal, resulting in their expulsion from treatment 
programmes.

<p>294. On <b>18 March 2010</b>, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur 
on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers sent a joint urgent appeal to the Government of 
the Syrian Arab Republic<b> </b>regarding Mr. Haithem al Maleh, 78 years old. Mr. al Maleh has </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>43 
</b></p>
<p>been a lawyer since the 1950s and in 2001 established the Human Rights Association in 
Syria (HRAS). Mr. al Maleh was the subject of two urgent appeals by several special 
procedures on 21 October 2009 and 23 February 2004. 
</p>
<p>295. According to the new information received,during Mr. al Maleh's incommunicado 
detention at the General Security building (see previous communication of 21 October 
2009), he was detained in a room without food or drink and in which a number of torture 
tools were displayed. There, he was reportedly subject to an inquiry by high ranking 
officers of the General Intelligence, who questioned him extensively on an interview he 
gave to Barada TV on 12 October 2009 and articles he had written regarding his client Mr. 
Muhannad Al-Hassani, as well as other human rights work he had undertaken.  
</p>
<p>296. On 19 October 2009, Mr. Haithem al Maleh was transferred to a branch of the 
Military Police in Qaboun, Damascus. On 3 November 2009, the Military General 
Prosecutor charged him with Articles 374 and 377 of the Criminal Law (Contempt of the 
Head of State&#8221;), Article 285 of the Criminal Law (Contempt of Public Administration), and 
Article 286 of the Criminal Law (Crime of disseminating false information affecting the 
morale of the nation). The military prosecution subsequently retained the charge under 
Article 286 of the Criminal Law, for which Mr. al Maleh remained in detention. According 
to the information received, his trial before the Military Court of Damascus was ongoing.  
</p>
<p>297. Since 21 October 2009, Mr. al Maleh had been detained in Adra prison, Damascus. 
Information received suggested that in the first few weeks of his detention and again since 
11 February 2010, Mr. al Maleh, who suffered from diabetes and an overactive thyroid 
gland, had been refused his medication as prescribed by his doctors, causing a serious 
deterioration of his state of health. Reports received suggested that during his hearing 
before the military judge on 22 February 2010, Mr. al Maleh was so weak that he could 
hardly speak. In addition, he had fainted during hearings earlier in February.  
</p>
<p>298. Mr. al Maleh was detained in a cell with approximately 60 people. The cell did not 
contain any beds, simply mattresses on the floor, which were shared by several detainees. 
Water in the prison was often cut off, meaning the detainees could not wash for long 
periods and had to use the toilet without any water &#8211; leading to serious health risks.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response received 
</b></p>
<p>299. On <b>1 April 2010</b> the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic replied to the urgent 
appeal sent on 18 March 2010. It expressed its willingness to work with the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights and mandates holders in pursuit of the shared goal 
of preventing human rights violations across the world. 
</p>
<p>300. It explained that Mr. Al-Maleh had been arrested by the competent authorities for 
committing unlywful acts which are punishable under the Syrian General Criminal Code. 
His arrest had nothing to do with his defending Mr. Al-Hassani. Mr. Al-Hassani had a 
number of lawyers for acting as his legal representative and defence team. None of these 
persons had been arrested for defending Mr. Al-Hassani. The Government stated that it 
fully respected the the legal practice of defending accused persons in court. 
</p>
<p>301. The Government also expressed its concerns about the sources having sent the 
information leading to the drafting of the urgent appeal by the Special Rapporteur. The 
Government of the Syrian Arab Republic considered that most of these sources had no 
other aim but to damage the good name of state by submitting false information and making 
unfounded allegations about it. 
</p>
<p>302. The Government sent recalled the different steps of Mr. Al-Maleh&#8217;s case, indicating 
that Mr. Al-Maleh&#8217;s case file has been sent to the chief military investigating judge in 
Damascus, who had interviewed Mr.Al-Maleh about the allegations and confronted him </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>44</b> 
</p>
<p>with the evidence submitted by the Office of the Prosecutor. The judge issued a decision, 
which was open to appeal at cassation. Mr. Al-Maleh appealed the decision through his 
defence lawyer. The appeal was lodged with the criminal division of the Syrian Court of 
Cassation, which is the highest court in the Syrian Arab Republic and has the final say. 
</p>
<p>303. Mr. Al-Maleh could exercise his full rights as a member of the Syrian society, 
including his right to freedom of expression and opinion. However, any citizen who stepped 
over the internationally recognized limits on the right to freedom of expression by inciting 
others, stirring up fear, undermining national unity and the prestige of the state and 
defaming the judiciary shall be deemed to have committed a criminal act punishable under 
Syrian law. The Government added that the laws of the Syrian Arab Republic were in 
conformity with all international treaties and norms. It assured that the country had a firmly 
established judiciary with judges who were impartial and had full authority in the exercise 
of their functions. 
</p>
<p>304. Subsequently the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic provided categorical 
assurance that Mr. Al-Maleh was receiving appropriate medical treatment and care in 
prison at the hands of the prison doctor. Should he or any other prisoner need medical care, 
the competent prison administration responsible for protecting prisoners&#8217; welfare would 
make sure they are given a physical examination. This was in line with the values and 
cultural heritage of the country, which required to provide prisoners with full humanitarian 
and health care, irrespective of the obligations set our in the relevant international treaties 
by which the country was bound.

sent a joint urgent appeal to the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic regarding the 
situation of Mr. Amro Okleh, a writer and a political activist, who worked as a government 
employee at the &#8220;Board of Control and Inspection&#8221; of Al Hassaka, the Syrian Arab 
Republic. Mr. Amro Okleh was a member of the Damascus Declaration for national 
democratic change and the author of a number of articles published in the Syrian press. Mr. 
Okleh was married with two children and lived in the Syrian Arab Republic. 
</p>
<p>307. According to the information received, on 15 November 2010, Mr. Okleh, aged 46, 
was allegedly arrested by agents of the State Security Services. It was reported that the 
security agents did not present any judicial warrant, nor did they explain the reason for Mr. 
Okleh&#8217;s arrest. They reportedly raided Mr. Okleh&#8217;s home and confiscated various personal 
belongings, including his mobile phone, a laptop and a computer.  
</p>
<p>308. It was reported that Mr. Okleh was subsequently taken to the Security State Services 
branch in Al Kameshli where he was being held in incommunicado detention. It was  
further reported that Mr. Okleh had not been allowed to see his family, nor had he been 
provided with medical treatment, despite his serious health condition. Mr. Okleh had 
reportedly been suffering from cardiac condition and heart disease. 
</p>
<p>309. Given that Mr. Okleh continued to be allegedly held incommunicado, concern wass

<p>311. On <b>17 February 2011</b>, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and 
the Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers sent a joint urgent 
appeal to the Government of Tajikistan<b> </b>concerning the detention and state of health of Mr. 
Ilhom Ismanov.  
</p>
<p>312. Mr. Ismanov had been the subject of a joint urgent appeal sent by the Chair-
Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers; and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment on 19 November 2010. In view of the 
allegations of torture and lack of medical attention, concern had been expressed about the 
physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Ismanov. Further concern had been expressed 
about the lack of investigation into the allegations of torture. To date, no response had been 
received from the Tajikistan Government regarding the circumstances of the case of Mr. 
Ismanov.  
</p>
<p>313. According to the new information received, in mid-November 2010, Mr. Ismanov 
had been transferred to a pre-trial detention facility in Khujand, Tajikistan. It wss further 
reported that Mr. Ismanov&#8217;s lawyer had been able to see him on 20 November 2010 for the 
first time since the court hearing of 12 November 2010.  However, she had reportedly not 
been able to meet him in private. Mr. Ismanov&#8217;s wife had reportedly been allowed to see 
him briefly in the presence of officers from the State Committee of National Security. It 
was reported that Mr. Ismanov had difficulty walking and looked frightened.  Reportedly, 
neither the lawyer nor Mr. Ismanov&#8217;s wife had been able to obtain any information as to 
whether an investigation had been launched into the torture allegations and the allegation 
that Mr. Ismanov had been detained since 3 November 2010 and not since 9 November 
2010 as stated by the police.  
</p>
<p>314. It was alleged that Mr. Ismanov had a serious respiratory disease and urgently 
needed medical examinations, in particular an x-ray of his chest, in order to administer the 
appropriate treatment. It was reported that SIZO no.2 was not equipped with adequate 
medical facility to establish Mr. Ismanov&#8217;s diagnosis and devise a plan for his treatment. It 
was also alleged that the prison administration of SIZO no.2, where Mr. Ismanov was 
detained, requested his family to provide medicine for him on several occasions. 
</p>
<p>315. In view of the allegations according to which Mr. Ismanov continued to remain with 
no access to medical care despite his deteriorating state of health, concern was expressed 
about the physical and mental integrity of Mr. Ismanov. Further concern was expressed 
about the lack of investigation into the allegations of torture. </p>

<p>317. On<b> 21 April 2010 </b>the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment 
of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Chairman of the Working Group on arbitrary detention sent a joint urgent 
appeal to the Government of Turkey<b> </b>regarding Mr. Murad Akincilar, born in 1962, 
secretary of the labour union UNIA at Geneva and political refugee in Switzerland. 
</p>
<p>318. According to the information received, on 30 September 2009, at 8 a.m., Mr. Murad 
Akincilar was arrested by police in Istanbul, where he wanted to visit his sick mother. He 
was held and interrogated at length numerous times in a police lock-up in Istanbul until 4 
October 2009. He was then transferred to Metris Prison (Istanbul) and later to Edurne 
Prison, 300 km north of Istanbul, where he was being detained without charges. 
</p>
<p>319. Mr. Murad Akincilar had not been provided with any information on the crime he 
was suspected of, nor had he received an official indictment. This situation rendered it 
difficult for him to defend himself or challenge his detention. It appeared that his detention 
may have been based on political motives, since he had published two articles in a journal 
critical of the Government (&quot;Demokratik D&#246;n&#252;s&#252;m&quot;), and had been politically active in an 
organisation named &quot;Devrimci Karag&#226;t&quot;. 
</p>
<p>320. In the course of the interrogations at the police in the beginning of October 2009, he 
had allegedly been deprived of sleep on numerous occasions and had been a number of 
times forced to look into extremely bright lights. Due to this treatment, it was reported that 
Mr. Murad Akincilar was loosing his eyesight because of retinal detachment. He had started 
encountering problems with his eyesight on 11 October, while detained in Metris Prison. 
However, the responsible officials allegedly refused to grant him medical care. During his 
transfer from Metris to Edurne Prison over a distance of 300 km he was reportedly shackled 
with chains; a week after the transfer, his wife could still observe that his legs were swollen 
and that he bore serious haematoma. On 16 October 2009, Mr. Murad Akincilar went on 
hunger strike, demanding urgent medical consultation for his eyes, which was eventually 
granted the same evening. Despite two belated operations on his eyes, he had already  lost 
65% of his eyesight of his right eye. On 26 March 2010, a further retinal detachment in his 
left eye was diagnosed and he again underwent surgery. 
</p>
<p>321. Concern was expressed regarding the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. 
Murad. With a view to his rapidly deteriorating eyesight, particular concern was expressed 
at the conditions of detention and the lack of medical care.

<p>323. On<b> 14 February 2011, </b>the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health sent an 
allegation letter to the Government of Ukraine concerning interference by law enforcement 
agencies with substitution maintenance therapy in Ukraine.  
</p>
<p>324. According to the information received, more than 6,000 drug dependent patients 
were receiving substitution maintenance therapy in 125 treatment facilities in Ukraine, and 
that the provision of that treatment remained an integral part of Ukraine&#8217;s HIV/AIDS 
prevention programmes. 
</p>
<p>325. It was alleged that the provision of substitution maintenance therapy to drug-
dependent patients in Ukraine had been severely hampered by the interference and 
inspections into patients&#8217; confidential data, initiated by the officials of the General Public 
Prosecutor Office, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and other inspection agencies. It was 
further alleged that the Drug Enforcement Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of 
Ukraine had issued an order No. 40/2/1-106 of 18 January 2011, which instructed heads of 
territorial units to collect personal and health-related information from drug users receiving 
substitution maintenance therapy. As a result, law enforcement officers had allegedly 
requested information from treatment facilities on their patients and had put pressure on 
patients and their relatives to participate in interviews and surveys.  
</p>
<p>326. Concern was expressed about the reports of the negative and counter-productive 
impact that the alleged actions by the law enforcement agencies were having on the 
important progress achieved so far in HIV/AIDS programme and substitution maintenance 
therapy in Ukraine.

<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>328. On <b>4 May 2010</b>, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of 
the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the Special 
Rapporteur on Contemporary forms of slavery, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights 
of migrants and the<b> </b>Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences sent a joint urgent appeal to the Government of the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland<b> </b>regarding Ms. Bita Ghaedi, a rejected asylum-seeker who was 
a national of Iran. Ms. Bita Ghaedi had exhausted most of the legal remedies available and 
allegedly received a deportation order to leave the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland on 20 April 2010.The deadline was postponed due to flight disturbances. 
Her deportation was rescheduled to take place on 5 May 2010 at 19.00 hrs by flight BD931. 
In the meantime an additional fresh claim for review of her case was submitted by her 
solicitor on 20 April 2010. The judicial review of the fresh claim submitted was scheduled 
to take place on 21 July 2010. 
</p>
<p>329. According to information received, Ms. Bita Ghaedi,  a national of Iran born on 10 
September 1974,  allegedly fled Iran escaping from a forced marriage.  She allegedly </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>48</b> 
</p>
<p>arrived in the United Kingdom on 2 October 2006. Upon her arrival in the United 
Kingdom, she claimed asylum on grounds of forced marriage in Iran. She had reportedly 
been forced into the marriage by her father in 2004 and remained in the forced marriage for 
approximately 2 years until she fled Iran.  In addition, she allegedly faced physical and 
psychological maltreatment by her father, brother and uncle because she was having an 
extramarital affair with Mr. Hamid Saedi. After filing her asylum claim, Ms. Ghaedi was 
reportedly taken to Holloway prison for 45 days after which she was released for the 
consideration of her asylum claim. The reason for her detention was never clarified.  
</p>
<p>330. In November 2006, Ms. Ghaedi reportedly met Mr. Mohsen Zadshir, a British 
national with whom she began an informal domestic partnership in October 2008. As a 
result of her relationship with Mr. Zadshir, in 2007, Ms. Ghaedi become involved in 
political activities and began working as a political activist with Anglo-Iranian women in 
the United Kingdom. She also became a supporter of the British Peoples Mojehadin 
Organization of Iran (PMOI) and the National Council for the Resistance of Iran (NCRI). 
Ms. Ghaedi campaigned on behalf of the PMOI in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland to draw attention to the situation of political prisoners and the execution of 
victims in Iran during a recent unrest.  
</p>
<p>331. On 16 August 2007, Ms. Bita Ghaedi's asylum claim was rejected by the Home 
Office and by the Court on 16 October 2007. As a consequence, on 4 December 2007, she 
attempted to commit suicide by taking an overdose, and was hospitalized. She was 
allegedly unconscious for three days and was discharged from the hospital on 2 January 
</p><p>2008. Her solicitor requested a revision of the case. 
</p>
<p>332. On 29 April 2009, she was allegedly detained and removal directions were set for 4 
May on the grounds of her immigration status. On 3 May, Ms. Bita Gaedhi's solicitor 
submitted an application for a leave to remain and she was released on 17 June 2009 as her 
case was accepted for judicial review. She was allegedly detained again on 11 November 
2009 and removal directions were set for 16 November. On the same date she reportedly 
began a hunger strike. On 16 November 2009 she was taken to Heathrow airport for 
deportation, but the deportation was cancelled by judicial order allegedly on the grounds of 
the need for further time to review the case.  On 2 December 2009 she was allegedly 
released on bail, conditional upon her presentation twice a week before the United 
Kingdom Border Agency (UKBA).   
</p>
<p>333. In January 2010, the UKBA authorities allegedly fixed 16 April 2010 as the date for 
the review of the conditions of her release. On 27 January 2010, she allegedly commenced 
another hunger strike after she was informed by Home Office solicitors that her claim had 
been rejected. 
</p>
<p>334. Given the health troubles associated with her hunger strikes, she was allegedly 
unable to comply with the condition of her release. Mr. Mohsen Zadshir periodically 
provided medical certificates to the UKBA to justify that it was impossible for Ms. Ghaedi 
to comply with the condition of her release. The most recent medical certificate was dated 
23 March 2010 and justified one month of sick leave. Her physical and mental health was 
weakened considerably to the point that she was unable to walk. Following friends&#8217; and 
medical practitioners&#8217; advice, she allegedly ended her hunger strike on 20 March 2010.  
</p>
<p>335. On 25 March 2010 Ms. Ghaedi's solicitor submitted a fresh claim, as the United 
Kingdom asylum procedure permits rejected asylum applicants to lodge a fresh claim and 
give the Government the prerogative of deciding whether or not the fresh submission is to 
be considered.  
</p>
<p>336. On 12 April 2010, Mr. Zadshir brought Ms. Ghaedi to UKBA authorities in a 
wheelchair, in order to bring her health condition to their attention, and present a request for 
the renewal of her release on bail, which was to be reviewed by 16 April 2010.  UKBA </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>49 
</b></p>
<p>authorities requested Mr. Zadshir and Ms. Ghaedi to return in the afternoon of 16 April 
</p><p>2010. 
</p>
<p>337. On 16 April 2010 around 6:30 a.m., Home Office authorities allegedly arrived at 
Ms. Ghaedi's place of residence with an ambulance, arrested her and detained her at Yarl's 
Wood. Mr. Zadshir reported that her health remained a concern while she was in detention.   
</p>
<p>338. Additional documentation was submitted to the Home Office by Ms. Bita Ghaedi's 
solicitor on 20 April 2010, who according to Mr. Zadshir was going to submit an 
application for urgent injunction to request to suspend Ms. Ghaedi's removal from the 
United Kingdom scheduled on 5 May 2010 pending the consideration of the judicial review 
of the fresh claim, which was scheduled to take place on 21 July 2010.  
</p>
<p>339. Her forcible removal from the United Kingdom was initially planned for 20 April 
2010, but was postponed due to flight cancellations. Her deportation has been rescheduled 
to take place on 5 May 2010 at 19.00 hrs by flight BD931.  
</p>
<p>340. Information received indicated that, if returned to Iran, M. Ghaedi might be 
subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment as a result of having abandoned a forced 
marriage and because of the resulting implications on family honour. Information received 
also suggested that, if returned to Iran, Ms. Ghaedi might encounter harassment, arrest or 
detention because of her political involvement with the PMOI while in the United 
Kingdom. Furthermore, her health might be at risk as her physical and psychological 
condition had considerably deteriorated, at least partly due to the possibility of being 
deported to Iran. Additionally, she considered that her rights to family and private life with 
her partner Mr. Zadshir, who was a British national, might also be infringed.

<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>342. On <b>24 September 2009,</b> the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health sent an 
allegation letter to the Government of the United States of America concerning the use of 
the Special 301 Program, Section 182 of the Trade Act of 1974 
</p>
<p>343. It was alleged that the United States had used the United States Trade Representative 
(USTR) Special 301 Program to promote intellectual property regulations that restricted 
access to affordable medications around the world. Since its creation in 1988, the Special 
301 Program has published an annual report that includes a list of countries denying 
&#8220;adequate and effective protection of intellectual property&#8221; and has permitted the unilateral 
imposition of trade sanctions against such countries. It was alleged that the Special 301 
review process was used to pressurize States into compliance with U.S. intellectual 
property policy, irrespective of whether their existing practices were legitimate and legal 
under international law. This, in turn, allegedly forced affected States to change their 
internal practices, limiting generic medicine production and, thereby, restricting access to 
essential medicines and infringing the enjoyment of the right to health. 
</p>
<p>344. Furthermore, it was alleged that the use of Special Program 301 to promote 
intellectual property regulations that restricted access to affordable medications causes 
suffering around the world. This was allegedly demonstrated by the selective inclusion of 
access-limiting calls for additional intellectual property protection in the Special 301 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>50</b> 
</p>
<p>reports. The negative impact of increased intellectual property protections was illustrated 
generally by a number of independent reports produced by Oxfam (&quot;All costs, no benefits: 
How TRIPS-Plus intellectual property rules in the US-Jordan FTA affect access to 
medicines&quot;), Georgetown University (A prescription for failure: Health and intellectual 
property in the Dominican Republic&quot;), and a US House of Representatives report on Trade 
Agreements and Access to Medications under the Bush Administration on trade and 
intellectual property.  
</p>
<p>345. It was reported that subsequent to the TRIPS agreement, the United States used the 
Special 301 Program to press many countries to relinquish their rights to use TRIPS 
flexibilities, including compulsory licenses (i.e., authorization to use a patent in return for 
compensation) and &#8220;parallel imports&#8221; to obtain less expensive versions of patented drugs 
from other countries endangering HIV/AIDS and other disease treatment programmes. 
Even after the Doha Declaration of 2001 on TRIPS and Public Health, several countries, 
including Brazil, India and Thailand, were allegedly placed on Special 301 watch lists and 
threatened with sanctions for making use of TRIPS flexibilities, including utilizing 
transition periods and issuing compulsory licenses.  
</p>
<p>346. It was alleged that the United States Government continued to pressure countries to 
adopt escalating intellectual property rules for medicines despite a pledge to support &#8220;the 
rights of sovereign nations to access quality-assured, low-cost generic medication to meet 
their pressing public health needs&#8221; made by President Obama during his presidential 
campaign.  
</p>
<p>347. The 2009 and 2010 Special 301 reports listed a number of complaints concerning 
&#8220;lack of protection against unfair commercial use of undisclosed test and other data.&#8221; In 
2010, 15 countries were cited for lack of adequate pharmaceutical data protection (Algeria, 
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Dominican Republic, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Lebanon, Malaysia, 
Mexico, Pakistan, Paraguay, Turkey and Vietnam), although data protection of the type 
sought for by the US for pharmaceuticals was not required under the TRIPS Agreement. 
Countries such as Thailand allegedly remained on the 2010 list for its TRIPS-compliant use 
of compulsory licenses for medicines needed to treat AIDS and other diseases, which was 
permissible under the TRIPS Agreement. In both the 2009 and 2010 reports, Brazil, India 
and the Philippines were criticized for laws that banned patents on new forms and used of 
known inventions, which were permissible under the TRIPS flexibilities, pushing those 
countries to grant patents on a larger range of innovations than required by TRIPS.  
</p>
<p>348. The 2009 and 2010 reports also warned against the use of &#8220;counterfeit&#8221; 
pharmaceuticals without giving a clear definition to the term. Under TRIPS, &#8220;counterfeit&#8221; 
referred to a product that wilfully deceives consumers by using an identical mark to the 
originator. It was not correctly applied to an allegedly unauthorized generic version of a 
patented product or to lesser forms of trademark infringement that did not use identical 
marks. The reports frequently alleged concerns with &#8220;unauthorized use of bulk active 
pharmaceutical ingredients&#8221; by manufacturers in Brazil, China and India. But the reports 
allegedly failed to identify who determined that these uses were unauthorized. The proper 
mechanism for enforcing a patent and determining if a particular use was in fact a violation 
is through civil litigation. The Special 301 reports supposedly cited no such litigation.  
</p>
<p>349. In all of these cases, it was alleged that the use or threat of sanctions by the United 
States Government resulted in changes in the behaviour of the affected State in a manner 
that restricted access to medicines. As an example, it was alleged that the placement of 
Thailand on the 2007 Priority Watch List deterred the country from granting additional 
compulsory licenses for necessary medicines limiting access. It was similarly alleged that 
pressure on countries to adopt data-protection provisions not required by TRIPS through 
the Special 301 Program, in conjunction with including such provisions in free trade 
agreements, resulted in adoption of these provisions, and thereby higher-priced medicines </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>51 
</b></p>
<p>throughout Central America. Many additional instances of such changes in state behaviour 
were also reported.  
</p>
<p>350. Moreover, it was alleged that Special 301 Program had been used to take unilateral 
action against non-complying countries in the form of elevated, retaliatory tariff barriers, 
not only through threat of sanction.

<p>352. On <b>11 May 2010</b>, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment 
of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression sent a joint allegation letter to 
the Government of Uzbekistan concerning the sentencing of Mr. Maxim Popov, 
psychologist, founder and director of the non-governmental organization Izis, founded by 
young medical professionals which works on HIV/AIDS prevention. Izis has also 
implemented HIV prevention activities, including under contracts with UNICEF, UNFPA 
and UNAIDS.  
</p>
<p>353. According to the information received, Mr. Maxim Popov was arrested in January 
2009 and convicted in July 2009. His conviction was publicly disclosed only at the end of 
February 2010. Mr. Popov was sentenced to 7 years imprisonment for charges which 
included theft by embezzlement, concealment of foreign currency, tax evasion, inducing 
minors to antisocial behaviour, indecent assault without violence against a minor and 
inducing engagement in the use of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances. 
</p>
<p>354. It was believed that Mr. Popov was convicted in connection with writing and 
distributing HIV/AIDS prevention materials. Mr. Maxim Popov was the author of the 
brochure &#8220;HIV and AIDS today&#8221;, a publication funded by UNAIDS and UNICEF. He was 
also convicted for distributing HIV prevention materials published by UNAIDS and other 
UN agencies to adolescents that explicitly refered to drug use, sex work and homosexuality.  
</p>
<p>355. Concern was expressed that the arrest and sentencing of Mr. Maxim Popov may be 
related to his peaceful activities in defence of human rights, in particular his work on 
HIV/AIDS prevention. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response received 
</b></p>
<p>356. On <b>30 June 2010</b>, the Government of Uzbekistan replied to the joint allegation letter 
sent on 11 May 2010. It provided information on IZIS and on Mr. Popov. 
</p>
<p>357. With regard to IZIS, the Government indicated that in the course of the checks 
conducted to ensure that the aims of the organisation were in accordance with the law, it 
was found that the requirements of the statute had been breached and that there had been 
violations of Uzbek law, some of them of a criminal nature. The materials of the 
verification process were handed over to the public prosecutor&#8217;s office and criminal charges 
were brought against IZIS. The criminal court found Mr. Popov to be guilty and 
subsequently the Tashkent Civil Court accepted the application for IZIS to be dissolved. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>52</b> 
</p>
<p>358. Concerning Mr. Popov, the Court ruled that he had abused his official position as 
director of IZIS by embezzling  large sums of money that were supposed to be used for 
projects related to IZIS. Notably, Mr. Popov and his chief accountant Mr. Kostyuchenko, 
embezzled funds provided by UNICEF regional office, UNDP, the Regional Management 
Board of the Central Asia AIDS Control Project etc. Besides, Mr. Popov misappropriated 
material goods placed in his charge, of a total value of a 193,100 sum. 
</p>
<p>359. The Government added that Mr. Popov distributed a book in Uzbek education 
establishments attended by schoolchildren and students engaging in academic, sporting or 
communal activities, which promoted the use of narcotic drugs and antisocial behaviour 
among the young. The Government considered that Mr. Popov was well aware of the nature 
of the book&#8217;s content. The book contained texts instructing young people of sexual 
activities and propaganda for homosexuality, pornography and pornographic images.  
</p>
<p>360. As a result Mr. Popov was found guilty and sentenced to seven years imprisonment 
and stripped him of the right to hold any office involving the direction of an organization or 
economic administration for two years.

<p>365. Debido a las repetidas amenazas y ataques, desde su ingreso en el centro 
penitenciario hace siete meses, la Jueza Afuini se encontrar&#237;a confinada en una celda del 
pabell&#243;n de admisi&#243;n del centro penitenciario aislada las 24 horas del d&#237;a sin poder salir a

el centro.           
</p>
<p>366. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, la salud de la Jueza Afuini se habr&#237;a deteriorado 
durante los &#250;ltimos meses durante los cuales se habr&#237;an detectado lesiones e irritaciones 
cut&#225;neas, falta de coordinaci&#243;n motora y visual as&#237; como s&#237;ntomas de un cuadro ansioso-

d&#8217;all&#233;gation &#224; l&#8217;entreprise Areva au sujet des mines d&#8217;uranium au Niger, dans la r&#233;gion 
nord-ouest de la province d&#8217;Agadez qui pouvaient probablement avoir des effets nocifs 
ainsi qu&#8217;un impact continu sur la jouissance des droits &#233;conomiques, sociaux et culturels 
des communaut&#233;s affect&#233;es, notamment en ce qui concernait la r&#233;gion autour des villes 
mini&#232;res d&#8217;Arlit et d&#8217;Akokan. &#192; cet &#233;gard, le rapporteur sp&#233;cial souhaitait partager avec 
Areva ses pr&#233;occupations en la mati&#232;re et a transmis &#224; l&#8217;entreprise le contenu des 
all&#233;gations partag&#233;es avec le Gouvernement du Niger (cf. communication envoy&#233;e au 
Gouvernement du Niger). 
</p>
<p><b>  Response received 
</b></p>
<p>371. Le <b>3 d&#233;cembre 2010</b>, l&#8217;entreprise Areva a r&#233;pondu &#224; la communication envoy&#233;e le 5 
Ao&#251;t 2010. Par sa r&#233;ponse exhaustive, l&#8217;entreprise Areva a souhait&#233; clarifier les all&#233;gations 
port&#233;es &#224; l&#8217;attention du rapporteur sp&#233;cial et d&#233;montrer que l&#8217;entreprise remplissait 
largement ses obligations d&#8217;entreprise. Le groupe a consid&#233;r&#233; que les all&#233;gations semblaient 
&#234;tre sans fondement document&#233;. En effet, Areva effectue une surveillance continue et 
exhaustive autour de ses installations et s&#8217;assure de prot&#233;ger les populations locales, la 
sant&#233; de ses travailleurs et l&#8217;environnement. Le groupe a cit&#233; les textes de r&#233;f&#233;rence 
encadrant ses obligations l&#233;gales, &#224; la fois au niveau national (Niger) et international.  De 
plus, le groupe a cit&#233; un nombre de mesures prises afin de veiller au respect des droits de 
l&#8217;homme des populations locales et au respect de l&#8217;environnement. 
</p>
<p>372. Chaque entit&#233; op&#233;rationnelle d&#8217;AREVA s&#8217;est dot&#233;e de Plans d&#8217;Intervention 
d&#8217;Urgence. Le groupe d&#233;taille dans sa r&#233;ponse &#224; titre d&#8217;exemple le plan d&#8217;urgence des 
transports de mati&#232;res radioactives, processus se d&#233;ployant en quatre phases. AREVA 
apporte &#233;galement son aide aux populations lors de besoins d&#8217;approvisionnement 
alimentaire d&#8217;urgences. L&#8217;entreprise apporte un soutien continu aux Nig&#233;riens lors de 
chacune de ces crises.  De plus, le groupe AREVA a mis en place une organisation en </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>54</b> 
</p>
<p>charge des questions de suret&#233;, s&#233;curit&#233;, sant&#233; et environnement qui lui permet de d&#233;finir 
des standards internes, de soutenir les actions des entit&#233;s op&#233;rationnelles et de les contr&#244;ler. 
AREVA dispose &#233;galement d&#8217;un dispositif de l&#8217;impact radiologique de ses activit&#233;s sur 
l&#8217;environnement et les populations sur les sites miniers d&#8217;Arlit et d&#8217;Akokan.  
</p>
<p>373. Dans un souci de transparence sur l&#8217;impact de ses activit&#233;s, AREVA s&#8217;est engag&#233; 
aux cot&#233;s de deux ONG fran&#231;aises pour la cr&#233;ation d&#8217;un Observatoire de la Sant&#233; sur tous 
les sites miniers. 
</p>
<p>374. Dans le cadre de ces observatoires, AREVA s&#8217;engage &#224; r&#233;parer et &#224; traiter les 
maladies s&#8217;il est av&#233;r&#233; que celles-ci sont dues &#224; l&#8217;activit&#233; mini&#232;re.  AREVA a en outre 
r&#233;cemment d&#233;cid&#233; de mener une Evaluation des Impacts sur la Sant&#233; pour tous ses 
nouveaux projets miniers. 
</p>
<p>375. Le groupe a expliqu&#233; qu&#8217;il mettait  un accent croissant sur la responsabilit&#233; sociale et 
soci&#233;tale de ses filiales mini&#232;res, ce qui constitue pour AREVA une condition pr&#233;alable &#224; 
une bonne gestion des risques, en particulier pour les droits de l&#8217;Homme. AREVA a cr&#233;&#233; en 
juillet 2009 une direction de la Responsabilit&#233; Environnementale et Soci&#233;tale, dont les 
attributions couvrent &#233;galement les droits humains, lesquels font l&#8217;objet d&#8217;une attention 
particuli&#232;re. Apr&#232;s plusieurs ann&#233;es de recherche et de d&#233;veloppement de la part des 
organismes sp&#233;cialistes des droits de l&#8217;Homme, diff&#233;rents outils de HRIA (Human Rights 
Impact Assessment) sont disponibles ou en voie de l&#8217;&#234;tre. Par ailleurs, AREVA a expliqu&#233; 
qu&#8217;il jugeait essentiel l&#8217;effort de pr&#233;vention et de formation &#224; l&#8217;&#233;thique et aux droits de 
l&#8217;homme dans l&#8217;entreprise. Le groupe participe en effet &#224; un nouveau programme de 
formation inter-entreprise. 
</p>
<p>376. En outre, le groupe AREVA demande depuis 2006 &#224; ses fournisseurs, dont ceux du 
Niger, de souscrire &#224; &#171; l&#8217;Engagement d&#233;veloppement durable applicable aux fournisseurs &#187;. 
Les prestataires du groupe doivent s&#8217;engager &#224; promouvoir et &#224; respecter la protection du 
droit international relatif aux droits de l&#8217;Homme dans leurs p&#233;rim&#232;tres d&#8217;activit&#233;.  
</p>
<p>377. Enfin, en vertu du principe ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable), AREVA 
conduit ses activit&#233;s industrielles de mani&#232;re &#224; limiter autant que possible son impact sur 
l&#8217;environnement. Les activit&#233;s mini&#232;res et industrielles sont men&#233;es dans un p&#233;rim&#232;tre 
d&#233;fini de longue date et &#233;loign&#233; de plusieurs kilom&#232;tres des lieux d&#8217;habitation. En cas de 
pr&#233;judice av&#233;r&#233; caus&#233; par son activit&#233; mini&#232;re, AREVA met en &#339;uvre les moyens 
n&#233;cessaires &#224; la compensation des populations.

<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>379. On <b>8 December 2010</b>, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health sent an 
allegation letter to the European Union concerning the effect of the proposed European 
Union-India free trade agreement on access to medicines, both within India and in other 
parts of the developing world. The Special Rapporteur shared the concerns he had 
expressed to the Government of India (para 121-128) and reiterated that several Indian 
generic medicines, such as efavirenz and heat-stable lopinavir/ritonavir, were reportedly 
supplied to the public health system of Thailand under government use-compulsory 
licenses. He noted that the national health scheme would reportedly face major financial </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>55 
</b></p>
<p>constraints if the supply line of Indian generic medicines was disrupted. Similarly, in the 
private sector, it was reported that medicines from India had been competing to provide 
lower prices and therefore greater access for those individuals who bought their drugs 
themselves. Both of these avenues would allegedly be affected by TRIPS-plus provisions in 
the EU-India free trade agreement under negotiation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response received 
</b></p>
<p>380. On <b>23 December 2010</b>, Mr. Daniel Cohn-Bendit and Ms. Rebecca Harms, Co-
Presidents of the Greens/ European Free Alliance at the European Parliament, as well as 
Ms. Ska Keller, Member of the European Parliament replied to the letter sent on 8 
December 2010. They highlighted the contradicting views on the issue, basing themselves 
on a sustainability assessment conducted by the European Commission and on concerns of 
parliamentarians. 
</p>
<p>381. The assessment did not envisage direct effect on health. On the contrary, it came to 
the conclusion that increases in incomes, real wages, employment opportunities and 
declining poverty ratios could indirectly have positive effects on health in India. However, 
organizations such as M&#233;decins sans Fronti&#232;res expected that the FTA could severely 
hamper the global access to affordable medicines. Various parliamentarians also expressed 
concern that the negotiating agenda of the agreement reflected European pharmaceuticals 
business interests in a disproportioned way, and that poverty eradication and sustainable 
development were not central to the negotiations. 
</p>
<p>382. Given these contradicting views, the Special Rapporteur was invited to conduct a 
special inquiry concerning the possible impacts of the FTA on the access to affordable 
medicines in India and other developing countries. 
</p>

<p>383. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its response received on 23 
December 2010.
