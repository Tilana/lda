(3) This represents 1,601 ounces of gold bullion inventory, with a total cost of $877 per ounce,
shown at the June 30, 2015 closing market price of $1,171 per ounce of gold.
 
For the purposes herein, "H1 2015" refers to the six month period ended June 30, 2015 and
(4) For the purposes herein, "H1 2015" refers to the six month period ended June 30, 2015 and
"H1 2014" refers to the six month period ended June 30, 2014.
Revenues during the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 were $42,597 and
$83,600, respectively, compared with revenues of $26,534 and $56,973, respectively, for
the corresponding periods in 2014. During the second quarter of 2015, ounces of gold sold
increased by 74% to 35,665 ounces compared to sales of 20,537 ounces during the second
quarter of 2014. The average gold price per ounce sold in the quarter was $1,194
compared to an average price of $1,292 per ounce obtained during the corresponding prior
year period.
Mine operating expenses, including depletion and depreciation, for the three and six-
month periods ended June 30, 2015 were $28,068 and $52,349, respectively, compared to
$22,242 and $46,640 for the respective three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2014.
The increase in costs during the 2015 three and six month periods was due to higher
depreciation and depletion as a result of increased production and expansion assets
commissioned in mid-2014, and increased milling throughput, for a total of 428,661 tonnes
and 857,505 tonnes, respectively, compared to 340,654 and 593,344, respectively in the
corresponding prior year periods. Additionally, the timing of production versus gold sales
and the resulting inventory adjustment impacted the mine operating expenses.

Gross earnings from operations for the respective three and six-month periods ended June
30, 2015, were $14,529 and $31,251, respectively, compared to $4,292 and $10,333,
respectively, for the corresponding periods of 2014. The 74% higher gold sales during Q2
2015 compared to Q2 2014, with a corresponding 26% increase in mine operating
expenses translated into improving gross margins by over 238%. The gross earnings
increase was partially offset by the decrease in revenue per ounce, resulting in a gold
margin per ounce increase from $528 per ounce in the second quarter of 2014 to $607 per
ounce in the second quarter of 2015.
Cash costs on a sales basis for H1 2015 were $558 per ounce, a reduction of 30% from
$794 per ounce in H1 2014. Cash costs per ounce on a sales basis for the second quarter
of 2015 were $587 per ounce of gold (compared to $764 per ounce of gold for the second
quarter of 2014 and $527 per ounce for the first quarter of 2015). Cash costs for the second
quarter of 2015 were lower than the prior year quarter as a result of continued levels of
increased productivity at Twangiza. Consistent with the first quarter of 2015, Twangiza
maintained steady state production levels and normalized production costs in line with life
of mine expectations as well as benefits from the reductions in diesel pricing.
All-in sustaining costs were $643 per ounce for H1 2015, a 29% reduction from $902 per
ounce in H1 2014. All-in sustaining costs were $701 per ounce for the second quarter of
2015 (compared to $945 per ounce of gold for the second quarter of 2014 and $581 per
ounce for the first quarter of 2015).
In April 2015, the Company closed the remaining $70 million of the $90 million financing,
the agreements for which were signed in the first quarter of 2015 (refer to corporate
development below). With the completion of these transactions in April 2015, the Company
replaced short-term debt with longer term facilities and improved its financial leverage.
(II) OPERATIONAL - TWANGIZA
During the second quarter of 2015, Twangiza was loss time injury (“LTI”) free, progressing
to over eighteen months and 7.5 million LTI free hours since the last recorded LTI.
During the second quarter of 2015, the plant at the Twangiza Mine processed 428,661
tonnes of ore (compared to 340,654 tonnes during the second quarter of 2014 and 428,844
tonnes in the first quarter 2015), maintaining the first quarter of 2015 achievement of 101%
of design capacity. Ongoing debottlenecking and incremental process improvements
allowed for throughput levels to be maintained while increasing the proportion of non-oxide
material to an average of 43% for the quarter. Ore was processed during the second quarter
of 2015 at an indicated head grade of 3.01 g/t Au (compared to 2.44 g/t Au during the
second quarter of 2014 and 3.21 g/t Au during the first quarter of 2015) with a recovery rate
of 82.2% (compared to 84.3% during the second quarter of 2014 and 80.7% in first quarter
2015) to produce 34,325 ounces (compared to 21,431 ounces during the second quarter of
2014 and 35,943 ounces in first quarter 2015) of gold.

respectively.
(2) Refer to the Namoya - Mine Under Construction section below for additional information.
During the second quarter of 2015, the Namoya Mine produced 10,525 ounces of gold from
a total of 330,267 tonnes of ore, stacked and sprayed on the heap leach pads, at an
indicated head grade of 1.53 g/t Au. Stacking levels at the beginning of the second quarter
decreased substantially from those achieved in March 2015, as a result of the impact of
modifying the mine plan to allow for earlier access to the Kakula reserve pit as well as the
adverse impact of unseasonably high rains on the delivery of materials and supplies.
During the second half of June and early July, Namoya achieved stacking rates in excess
of 5,000 tonnes per day ("tpd") leading to material stacked in July of 151,026 tonnes.
Further improvements are expected in August and September. Namoya’s focus is on ore
delivery in order to support the increases in the stacking rate towards commercial levels as
well as optimizing the stacking process with the agglomerated heap leach in order to
improve percolation and gold extraction.
For the third quarter of 2015, Namoya is preparing for the delivery of the CAT 777 mining
fleet additions in early September and commissioning in phases starting in September. The
Namoya Summit has been cleared for delineation and is planned to be ready for production
activities during the fourth quarter of 2015.
(IV) EXPLORATION
Consistent with the first quarter of 2015, exploration activities in the second quarter of 2015
were limited as the Company focused on development at Namoya and incremental
operational achievements at Twangiza. Target drilling has commenced for the Namoya
Summit related targets in the third quarter of 2015.
(V) CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT
In April 2015, the Company closed the second $20 million forward sale and the $50 million
gold streaming transactions, which had been signed in February 2015. The forward sale
transaction provides for the prepayment by the purchaser of $20 million for its purchase of
22,248 ounces of gold from the Twangiza mine, with the gold deliverable over three years,
at 618 ounces per month. The forward sale may be terminated at any time upon payment to
the purchaser of a one-time termination amount that would result in the purchaser receiving
an internal rate of return of 20%. The terms of the forward sales also include a gold floor
price mechanism whereby, if the gold price falls below $1,100 per ounce in any month,
additional ounces are deliverable to ensure a realized gold price of $1,100 per ounce for
that month. The streaming transaction provides for the payment by the purchaser of a
deposit in the amount of $50 million and the delivery to the purchaser over time of 8.33% of
the life-of-mine gold production from the Namoya mine (or any other projects located within
20 kilometres from the current Namoya gold mine). The ongoing payments to Namoya upon
delivery of the gold are $150 per ounce.
4
In April 2015, the Company closed a $10 million forward sale to finance the purchase of the
expanded mobile fleet. The forward sale transaction provides for the prepayment by the
purchaser of $10 million for its purchase of 9,508 ounces of gold from the Twangiza mine,
with the gold deliverable over two years, at 396 ounces per month. The forward sale may
be terminated at any time upon payment to the purchaser of a one-time termination amount
that would result in the purchaser receiving an internal rate of return of 13%. The terms also
include a gold floor price mechanism whereby, if the gold price falls below $1,150 per
ounce in any month, additional ounces are deliverable to ensure a realized gold price of
$1,150 per ounce for that month.
TWANGIZA MINE
Twangiza  focused  on  debottlenecking  during  the  second  quarter  of  2015,  and  incrementally
improved  the  processing  of  ore  with  the  ongoing  blending  of  non-oxide  material.  This  focus
allowed for the operation to maintain throughput at the annualized design capacity of 1.7 Mtpa,
while increasing the proportion of non-oxide material to an average of 43% for the quarter. The
increase in mineral reserves (see Banro’s June 8, 2015 press release), together with the plant's
success in maintaining annualized throughput levels through two consecutive quarters, provides
confidence in the plant's ability to maintain current performance levels. Similar to the first quarter,
mine productivity allowed for the availability of high grade ore in addition to appropriate blending
of  oxide  and  non-oxide  material.  Twangiza  management  will  continue  to  focus  on  process
optimization  to  secure  reliable  throughput  levels  that  can  be  maintained  through  the  rainy
season.

In  the  second  quarter  of  2015,  Twangiza  achieved  production  levels  above  the  2015  monthly
average production guidance of 9,000 ounces per month. Cash costs during the quarter were
11%  higher  than  the  first  quarter  of  2015  and  represented  a  23%  reduction  from  the  second
quarter of 2014. Similar to recent quarters, the improved operating results continue to be driven
by the ability for the operations to achieve design production levels throughout the operations.
Mill  throughput  was  the  most  significant  contributor  which  had  a  26%  increase  in  tonnage
compared to the same prior year period with gross spending on processing only increasing by
approximately 3%.

A total of 770,162 tonnes of material (Q2 2014 – 871,849 tonnes) were mined during the three
month period ended June 30, 2015. Total ore mined was 548,175 tonnes (Q2 2014 – 485,276
tonnes).  The  strip  ratio  for  the  second  quarter  of  2015  decreased  to  0.41  as  compared  to  0.8
during the second quarter of 2014 in accordance with the mine schedule. The mining cost per
tonne milled during the second quarter of 2015 remained consistent with the first quarter of 2015
at $10.5 per tonne milled.
Processing & Engineering
For  the  three  month  period  ended  June  30,  2015,  the  plant  at  the  Twangiza  Mine  processed
428,661 tonnes of ore (Q2 2014 – 340,654 tonnes), representing a 26% increase over the prior
year period, as the operations continued to exceed the annualized rate of 1.7 Mtpa. Increased
throughput levels reduced the processing cost per tonne milled from $26.4 per tonne to $21.6 per
tonne, representing a decrease of 18%. The Twangiza plant once again displayed its operational
capability  by  running  above  design  capacity  and  successfully  processing  an  increasing
proportion of non-oxide material (43% of total Q2 2015 feed). Recoveries of 82.2% during the
period decreased compared to the corresponding prior year of 84.3% . As the plant processed
increased  levels  of  non-oxide  material,  site  management  continues  to  carry  out  activities  to
improve the recoveries. The processing costs were $0.25 million higher compared to Q2 2014 as
a result of the 26% increase in throughput, partially offset by lower power costs per tonne due to
lower realized diesel prices. Economies of scale allow the operation to benefit significantly from
the increased throughput and production rates.
Sustaining Capital Activities
Capital  spending  at  Twangiza  was  focused  on  upgrades  to  the  mobile  fleet  and  continued
construction  of  the  Tailings  Management  Facility  (“TMF”).  Mobile  fleet  upgrades  during  the
quarter included the replacement of critical components of the existing fleet. TMF construction
continued at increasing activity levels, with activity levels expected to increase during the third
quarter of 2015 based on the availability of appropriate waste material from mining activities.
Cash cost and All-in sustaining cost
Cash costs per ounce for the second quarter of 2015 were significantly lower than the prior year
period, primarily due to increased sales of 15,128 ounces or 74%, due to increased production
over the second quarter of 2014, while gross spending increased slightly as a result of higher
throughput in line with the design capacity of the mill. The all-in sustaining cost decreased from
$945 in Q2 2014 to $701 per ounce in Q2 2015, primarily due to the lower cash cost as well as
lower sustaining capital per ounce.

NAMOYA - MINE UNDER CONSTRUCTION
During  the  second  quarter  of  2015,  Namoya  continued  to  ramp  up  towards  commercial
production  levels.  The  modification  in  the  mine  plan  late  in  the  first  quarter  impacted  ore
availability early in the second quarter as the mine fleet focused on waste removal in order to
allow  for  increased  access  to  mining  faces  when  the  first  additions  to  the  mobile  fleet  were
commissioned in late May. This contributed to a decrease in the stacking level in April to 57,211
tonnes, which subsequently increased to 130,974 tonnes in May and 142,082 tonnes in June.
The significant decrease in stacking levels from March's 103,163 tonnes to April was also driven
by the adverse impact of unseasonably high rains which interrupted supply routes and the ability
to deliver procured materials and supplies. The availability of ore from mining activities and the
available medium grade stockpile material resulted in the stacking of ore with an average grade
of 1.53 g/t Au. Based on current mining activities, the proportion of fines content has decreased,
allowing for improvement in the quality of agglomerated material. The CIL circuit was not utilized
during  the  second  quarter  of  2015  as  the  focus  of  the  operations  continues  to  be  the
improvements to the heap leach processing circuit. Site management is continuing to implement
process modifications and upgrades, which are resulting in significant progress toward steady-
state operating levels. Namoya poured 3,114 ounces in April, 3,315 ounces in May and 4,096
ounces in June, for a second quarter 2015 total of 10,525 ounces of gold.
During  the  second  half  of  June  and  early  July,  Namoya  achieved  stacking  rates  in  excess  of
5,000  tonnes  per  day  ("tpd")  leading  to  material  stacked  in  July  of  151,026  tonnes.  Further
improvements are expected in August and September. As Namoya progresses through the third
quarter  of  2015,  the  contributions  from  the  second  stage  of  the  additional  mobile  fleet,  and
delivery of the currently procured third stage, will allow the operation to advance more quickly
with a number of mining activities, including waste stripping which was re-sequenced following
the  delay  in  financing.  The  resulting  improvement  in  ore  access  in  multiple  pits,  will  support
continuous increases in stacking rates following the currently commissioned process upgrades
early in the third quarter.
Heap  leach  operations  require  several  months  of  continuous  percolation  to  fully  recover  the
leachable gold. Thus, the process advancements from the second quarter, together with ongoing
improvements  to  the  heap  leach  circuit,  are  projected  to  result  in  monthly  gold  production  of
approximately 9,000 ounces once steady-state operating levels are achieved during Q4 2015.
During the second quarter of 2015, the Company recorded an impairment charge totalling $50.2
million against the Namoya Mine Under Construction balance in its interim condensed financial
statements, resulting in a net balance of $396 million as at June 30, 2015. As at June 30, 2015,
the  impairment  charges  in  relation  to  the  Namoya  Mine,  represent  approximately  5%  of  the
Company’s  pre-impairment  total  assets  and  approximately  11%  of  the  pre-impairment  Mine
Under Construction balance.
7
The impairment charge recorded was due to the aggregate adverse impact of the deterioration of
the long term gold price outlook, the Namoya stream, and the build-up of capitalized borrowing
costs  (interest  and  dividends  directly  attributable  to  the  construction  of  the  asset)  and  pre-
commercial operating losses from the extended ramp up due to the delay in financing and the
redesign of the plant.
Under  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (“IFRS”),  in  addition  to  the  project
development and the associated exploration and evaluation costs, the Mine Under Construction
balance includes borrowing costs, depreciation and pre-commercial operating losses. Prior to the
recognition of impairment charges, as at June 30, 2015, the Mine Under Construction balance
included over $70 million of borrowing costs, $20 million of depreciation and approximately $28
million of pre-commercial operating losses. The recorded $50.2 million impairment charge was
less than the amount of the above indirect project development costs, indicating that the Namoya
project development costs are recoverable under the prevailing market conditions.
EXPLORATION
Consistent  with  the  Company’s  focus  on  cash  flow  management  during  the  completion  of
development  at  Namoya  as  well  as  the  seasonality  of  exploration  activities  in  the  DRC,
exploration activities during the second quarter of 2015 involved the provision of support by the
geological teams for production related activities at the two mine sites, the use of small teams
focused on new oxide target generation activities in Lugushwa and Kamituga as a follow up to
the Q1 target prioritization reviews and ground maintenance activities.
As previously reported, to support the Twangiza and Namoya operations, near term exploration
will focus on the following:
•
•
•
Deliver  sufficient  drilling  to  allow  full  delineation  of mineable  material  for  the  Namoya
Summit - Filon B targets at Namoya;
Development and execution of the drill program to convert inferred and indicated resources
to higher confidence resources and mineral reserves within the existing open pits; and
Delineate  resources  from  identified  targets  within  a  5 kilometre  radius  of  the  current
operations.
Qualified Person
Daniel K. Bansah, the Company's Head of Projects and Operations and a "Qualified Person" as
such term is defined in National Instrument 43-101, has approved the technical information in this
press release.
NON-IFRS MEASURES
Management uses cash cost, all-in sustaining cost, gold margin and EBITDA to monitor financial
performance and provide additional information to investors and analysts. These metrics do not
have  a  standard  definition  under  IFRS  and  should  not  be  considered  in  isolation  or  as  a
substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. As these metrics do
not have a standardized meaning, it may not be comparable to similar measures provided by
other companies. However, the methodology used by the Company to determine cash cost per
ounce is based on a standard developed by the Gold Institute, which was an association which
included gold mining organizations, amongst others, from around the world.
8
The Company defines cash cost, as recommended by the Gold Institute standard, as all direct
costs that the Company incurs relating to mine production, transport and refinery costs, general
and  administrative  costs,  movement  in  production  inventories  and  ore  stockpiles,  less
depreciation and depletion. Cash cost per ounce is determined on a sales basis.

The Company defines all-in sustaining costs as all direct costs that the Company incurs relating
to mine production, transport and refinery costs, general and administrative costs, movement in
production  inventories  and  ore  stockpiles,  less  depreciation  and  depletion  plus  all  sustaining
capital costs (excluding exploration). All-in sustaining cost per ounce is determined on a sales
basis.

The Company defines gold margin as the difference between the cash cost per ounce disclosed
and the average price per ounce of gold sold during the reporting period.
Banro calculates EBITDA as net income or loss for the period excluding: interest, income tax
expense,  and  depreciation  and  amortization.  EBITDA  is  intended  to  provide  additional
information to investors and analysts. It does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by
IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance
prepared  in  accordance  with  IFRS.  EBITDA  excludes  the  impact  of  cash  costs  of  financing
activities  and  taxes,  and  the  effects  of  changes  in  operating  working  capital  balances,  and
therefore  is  not  necessarily  indicative  of  operating  profit  or  cash  flow  from  operations  as
determined  under  IFRS.  Other  companies  may  calculate  EBITDA  differently.  A  reconciliation
between net profit for the period and EBITDA is presented below:

Banro  Corporation is  a  Canadian  gold  mining  company  focused  on  production  from  the
Twangiza mine, which began commercial production September 1, 2012, and completion of its
second gold mine at Namoya located approximately 200 kilometres southwest of the Twangiza
gold  mine.  The  Company’s  longer  term  objectives  include  the  development  of  two  additional
major, wholly-owned gold projects, Lugushwa and Kamituga. The four projects, each of which
has a mining license, are located along the 210 kilometre long Twangiza-Namoya gold belt in
the South Kivu and Maniema provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the “DRC”). All
business activities are followed in a socially and environmentally responsible manner.
Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors 
The  United  States  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (the  "SEC")  permits  U.S.  mining
companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only those mineral deposits that a company
can economically and legally extract or produce. Certain terms are used by the Company, such
as "Measured", "Indicated", and "Inferred" "Resources", that the SEC guidelines strictly prohibit
U.S. registered companies from including in their filings with the SEC. U.S. Investors are urged to
consider  closely  the  disclosure  in  the  Company's  Form  20-F  Registration  Statement,  File  No.

Cautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements. All statements, other than statements of
historical  fact,  that  address  activities,  events  or  developments  that  the  Company  believes,
expects  or  anticipates  will  or  may  occur  in  the  future  (including,  without  limitation,  statements
regarding estimates and/or assumptions in respect of future gold production (including the timing
thereof), costs, cash flow and gold recoveries, mine life, Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve
estimates, potential Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves and the Company’s production,
development  and  exploration  plans  and  objectives)  are  forward-looking  statements.  These
forward-looking statements reflect the current expectations or beliefs of the Company based on
information  currently  available  to  the  Company.  Forward-looking  statements  are  subject  to  a
number  of  risks  and  uncertainties  that  may  cause  the  actual  results  of  the  Company  to  differ
materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements, and even if such actual results
are realized or substantially realized, there can be no assurance that they will have the expected
consequences to, or effects on the Company. Factors that could cause actual results or events to
differ materially from current expectations include, among other things: uncertainty of estimates of
capital  and  operating  costs,  production  estimates  and  estimated  economic  return  of  the
Company’s projects; the possibility that actual circumstances will differ from the estimates and
assumptions  used  in  the  economic  studies  of  the  Company’s  projects;  failure  to  establish
estimated mineral resources and mineral reserves (the Company’s mineral resource and mineral
reserve figures are estimates and no assurance can be given that the intended levels of gold will
be produced); fluctuations in gold prices and currency exchange rates; inflation; gold recoveries
being less than those indicated by the metallurgical testwork carried out to date (there can be no
assurance that gold recoveries in small scale laboratory tests will be duplicated in large tests
under on-site conditions or during production); uncertainties relating to the availability and costs
of financing needed in the future; changes in equity markets; political developments in the DRC;
lack of infrastructure; failure to procure or maintain, or delays in procuring or maintaining, permits
and approvals; lack of availability at a reasonable cost or at all, of plants, equipment or labour;
inability to attract and retain key management and personnel; changes to regulations affecting
the  Company's  activities;  the  uncertainties  involved  in  interpreting  drilling  results  and  other
geological data; and the other risks disclosed under the heading "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in
the  Company's  annual  report  on  Form  20-F  dated  April  6,  2015  filed  on  SEDAR  at
www.sedar.com and EDGAR at www.sec.gov. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of
the date on which it is made and, except as may be required by applicable securities laws, the
Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as
a result of new information, future events or results or otherwise. Although the Company believes
that the assumptions inherent in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, forward-looking
statements are not guarantees of future performance and accordingly undue reliance should not
be put on such statements due to the inherent uncertainty therein.
