<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted by the World 
Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993, underlined the importance of preserving 
and strengthening the system of special procedures and specified that the procedures and 
mechanisms should be enabled to harmonize and rationalize their work through periodic 
meetings.1 In recognition of the contribution of the twentieth anniversary of the Vienna 
Declaration to the special procedures system, the twentieth meeting of special rapporteurs, 
representatives, independent experts and chairpersons of working groups of the special 
procedures of the Human Rights Council was exceptionally held in Vienna from 24 to 28 
June 2013.  
</p>
<p>2.  Special procedures mandate holders thanked the Government of Austria for hosting 
their annual meeting in Vienna and expressed their appreciation for its recognition of the 
crucial role played by mandate holders in the implementation of the outcome of the World 
Conference on Human Rights. They also thanked the Government and the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) for facilitating their 
participation in the Conference on the occasion of its twentieth anniversary.  
</p>
<p>3. During the annual meeting, mandate holders exchanged views with the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the President of the Human Rights 
Council. Meetings were held with representatives of the United Nations Office on Drugs 
and Crime (UNODC), European human rights mechanisms, national human rights 
institutions (NHRIs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). A number of issues 
relating to working methods was discussed.  
</p>
<p><b> II.  Organization of work 
</b>4. The Chairperson of the nineteenth annual meeting and of the Coordination 
Committee of Special Procedures, Michel Forst, opened the meeting. He referred to the 
Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and its importance for the special procedures 
system and welcomed the recently appointed mandate holders, who were participating for 
the first time.  
</p>
<p>5. The Chief of the Special Procedures Branch updated participants on recent 
developments in the United Nations human rights system and the work of OHCHR. Since 
the end of June 2012, three new country mandates had been created to address the 
situation in Belarus, Eritrea and, most recently, Mali. As a result, there were currently 49 
mandates, including 6 five-member working groups, bringing the number of mandate 
holders to 73.2  
</p>
<p>6. In 2012, special procedures carried out 80 visits to 55 countries or territories, 
while the number of States issuing a standing invitation for visits rose to 94. Special 
procedures sent 603 communications to 127 States regarding concerns over specific 
individuals and situations. Seventy-five per cent of those were issued jointly. The 
response rate by States, however, remained disappointingly low at around 40 per 
cent.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

 A/CONF.157/24 (Part I), part II, para. 95. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 The mandate holder on the Syrian Arab Republic will take office when the Commission of Inquiry on 
</p>
<p>that country has concluded its work.  </p>


<p>7. It was stressed that joint action by mandate holders had been strengthened. For 
example, in February 2013, a panel on human rights mainstreaming and the role of special 
procedures had discussed how special procedures and other parts of the United Nations 
could work together to mainstream human rights across its work, whether in the context of 
development, peace and security or other areas. Mandate holders had continued to issue 
joint statements on issues of common interest, such as on the occasion of the High-Level 
Meeting of the General Assembly on the Rule of Law on 24 September 2012, and on 
International Women&#8217;s Day, and they advocated mainstreaming of human rights in the 
post-2015 agenda.  
</p>
<p>8. Participants&#8217; attention was drawn to the OHCHR planning process for the next four-
year cycle and mandate holders were called upon to provide their insights with a view to 
ensuring that OHCHR resources are spent where they are likely to have most impact. One 
of the major areas of focus and work of OHCHR is support and strengthening of human 
rights mechanisms. Examples of special procedures activities and results included in the 
2012 OHCHR report were highlighted. 
</p>
<p>9. Participants elected the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally 
displaced persons, Chaloka Beyani, Chairperson of the meeting and of the Coordination 
Committee. The Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearances, Olivier de Frouville, was elected Rapporteur and member of the 
Coordination Committee. The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in 
Eritrea, Sheila Keetharuth; the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in 
Myanmar, Tom&#225;s Ojea Quintana; and the Chairperson of the Working Group on the issue 
of discrimination against women in law and in practice, Frances Raday, were endorsed as 
members of the Committee. Farida Shaheed, a former Chairperson, will remain an ex 
officio member for the following year.  
</p>
<p>10. The provisional agenda of the meeting was revised and adopted. 
</p>
<p><b> III.  Activities of the Coordination Committee 
</b>11.  The outgoing Chairperson of the Coordination Committee briefed participants on the 
activities of the Committee in 2012/2013, noting that it had focused on strengthening 
engagement with various stakeholders, including the President of the Human Rights 
Council, States and regional human rights systems. Emphasis had also been placed on 
identifying situations and cross-cutting issues of common concern to mandate holders.  
</p>
<p>12.  Pursuant to the standing invitation to mandate holders to participate in special 
sessions of the Human Rights Council, which had resulted from a discussion between the 
President of the Council and the Chairperson of the Coordination Committee in November 
2008, arrangements were made to facilitate contributions of special procedures to special 
sessions. On 29 May 2013, during its twenty-third session, the Human Rights Council held 
an urgent debate on the deteriorating situation of human rights in the Syrian Arab Republic 
and the recent killings in Al-Qusayr. In that context, the Special Rapporteur on the human 
rights of internally displaced persons and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary 
or arbitrary executions delivered a statement on behalf of the Coordinating Committee and 
were invited to share their views from the perspective of their respective mandates. This 
was the first time that special procedures had been seated on the podium  and given the 
floor from there during an urgent debate of the Council. 
</p>
<p>13.  It is the established practice of the Human Rights Council to invite mandate holders 
to participate in panels of relevance to their mandates and in accordance with the modalities 
defined for each of these panels. In addition, chairpersons of the Coordinating Committee 
have been invited to participate in panels from the floor. On 1 March 2013, the Chairperson </p>


<p>of the Coordinating Committee consolidated this practice by making a statement from the 
floor on behalf of all special procedures mandate holders at the high-level panel discussion 
on human rights mainstreaming during the twenty-second session of the Council. He had 
also participated in a panel on human rights mainstreaming and the role of special 
procedures organized by the Special Procedures Branch in New York on 14 February 2013 
and he suggested that those practices would expand the space available to mandate holders 
for providing their perspectives in intergovernmental forums. 
</p>
<p>14.  The Chairperson of the Coordinating Committee discussed general questions 
relating to the special procedures system in meetings with stakeholders, including the 
President of the Human Rights Council and NGOs. He also raised the importance of 
encouraging qualified candidates to apply to become mandate holders in line with the 
appointment process established in 2011 as one outcome of the five-year review of the 
Council.  
</p>
<p>15.  The Chairperson of the Coordination Committee referred to the fact that several 
mandate holders had raised reprisals-related issues during their interactive dialogues with 
the Human Rights Council, noting that it was crucial for individuals and groups to have 
unhindered access to human rights mechanisms. The Chairperson raised the issue with 
several stakeholders, including NGOs and the President of the Council, asking them to 
maintain a strong stance on reprisals. On 13 September 2012 during the twenty-first session 
of the Council, the Chairperson had participated in the panel on the issue of intimidation or 
reprisal against individuals and groups who cooperate or have cooperated with the United 
Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights.  
</p>
<p>16.  The Chairperson of the Coordination Committee reported that NGOs appreciated the 
opportunity to meet regularly with the Coordinating Committee of Special Procedures, but 
would not favour the establishment of a formal coordination mechanism, as suggested 
during the nineteenth annual meeting. The Chairperson had continued his engagement with 
NGOs through informal meetings, in particular in the lead-up to the twentieth annual 
meeting. 
</p>
<p><b> IV.  Exchange of views with the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b>17. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights referred to the Vienna 
Declaration and Programme of Action as a milestone for the international human rights 
community and the special procedures system, as it provided the context in which they 
could become a key pillar of the United Nations human rights promotion and protection 
framework. She recalled that the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna had 
acknowledged the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights 
including the right to development and that the three United Nations pillars of development, 
peace and security and human rights, were equally important. It had also been in Vienna 
that the crucial role of civil society, NHRIs and regional human rights arrangements had 
been recognized and women&#8217;s rights had been put firmly on the international agenda for the 
first time.  
</p>
<p>18. The High Commissioner deplored the fact that in spite of the commitments made in 
Vienna, there were many human rights crises ongoing in many parts of the world, in 
particular in the Syrian Arab Republic, where political considerations appeared to have 
been prioritized over human rights and her calls for the situation to be referred to the 
International Criminal Court had gone unheeded. She indicated that the Special Rapporteur 
on the human rights of internally displaced persons had been tasked to report in August to 
the General Assembly on the situation of IDPs in the Syrian Arab Republic. She called </p>


<p>upon mandate holders not to let the victims of violations down or allow the perpetrators to 
act with impunity.  
</p>
<p>19. She noted the challenges that special procedures and other international human 
rights mechanisms continued to face, including the patchy implementation of their 
recommendations. She recalled that the universal periodic review (UPR) could serve as a 
tool for periodic follow-up. She stressed the fact that special procedures were well placed to 
hold States to account in respect of their human rights obligations and recommendations 
accepted during the UPR. Real change at the national level required all parts of the United 
Nations to work together. She welcomed the use of the collective voice of the special 
procedures including their demands that concrete measures to reduce inequality be included 
in the post-2015 agenda.  
</p>
<p>20. She drew attention to reprisals against persons who had collaborated with United 
Nations human rights mechanisms and the need to tackle the factors which created 
legislative and regulative environments conducive to reprisals and suppression of civil 
society. She noted that the panel on reprisals convened at the twenty-second session of the 
Human Rights Council on 13 September 2012 had put forward several recommendations, 
including observation of trials of human rights defenders; the establishment of a central 
registry of reprisals to ensure proper follow-up; strengthening steps to assist victims; and 
the establishment of national witness protection programmes. The High Commissioner told 
mandate holders that she was aware of disparaging personal remarks and verbal attacks 
against mandate holders, in the Council and in other contexts. She assured participants of 
her full support for them, in particular their independence.  
</p>
<p>21. In terms of planning for the future, the High Commissioner reminded mandate 
holders that, as part of the new OHCHR four-year planning cycle, she had solicited views 
from special procedures, among others. The inputs received formed the basis of the 
thematic priorities currently being defined by OHCHR. Strengthening human rights 
mechanisms would remain prominent as a tool for achieving progress in substantive areas, 
and as a substantive area for the Office. She mentioned that resources had become more 
scarce, both in terms of regular and extrabudgetary funds, and that the Office was actively 
exploring new funding sources. She said that OHCHR had sponsored a meeting with 
information technology companies, which indicated their desire to assist OHCHR to make 
better use of new technologies in human rights work. Steps had also been taken to improve 
the user-friendliness of the website.  
</p>
<p>22. Mandate holders who took the floor thanked the High Commissioner for the support 
provided by her and her Office and drew attention to their shrinking resources. In this 
regard, they noted that mandate holders should receive financial and human resources 
support on an equitable and transparent basis and underlined the importance of continuity in 
staffing. They raised the possibility of their proactive participation in the UPR mechanism. 
Several expressed concern that negative traditional and cultural attitudes might affect the 
implementation of international human rights, while others inquired about her views on the 
proposal for a world court on human rights. They asked her to prioritize a revamp of the 
OHCHR website and to ensure that opportunities offered by new technologies were 
actively pursued to facilitate access by victims to human rights mechanisms, especially 
special procedures. They also called on her to take measures to enhance the visibility of 
special procedures and that of OHCHR.   
</p>
<p><b> V.  Human Rights Council and the special procedures system 
</b>23. Participants exchanged views with the President of the Human Rights Council, 
Remigiusz Achilles Henczel, Permanent Representative of Poland to the United Nations </p>


<p>Office at Geneva, the Director of the Human Rights Council Special Procedures Division 
and the Chief of the Human Rights Council Branch of OHCHR.  
</p>
<p>24. The President of the Human Rights Council expressed appreciation for the 
opportunity to address the special procedures, pointing to the crucial role they play, calling 
them the &#8220;eyes and ears of the Council&#8221;. He welcomed the outgoing Chairperson of the 
Coordination Committee and congratulated the new Chairperson on his election, stating 
that he looked forward to their future cooperation. He welcomed the growing participation 
of mandate holders in the Council, including statements by two mandate holders in the 
urgent debate on the Syrian Arab Republic on 29 May 2013. He reassured special 
procedures mandate holders of his commitment to preserve and strengthen their 
participation in the work of the Council.  
</p>
<p>25. The President of the Human Rights Council provided an update on his recent trip to 
New York where he had highlighted the issue of the increasing number of mandates created 
by the Council without the matching necessary resources. The President stated that special 
procedures were essential to foster human rights mainstreaming within the United Nations 
system, including by cooperating with various United Nations entities. He highlighted the 
full independence and integrity of special procedures mandate holders and his strong stance 
in relation to derogatory remarks and personal attacks against them during Council 
sessions. He underlined his firm commitment to preserve the space available for civil 
society and to denounce publicly any acts of intimidation or reprisals against those who 
sought to cooperate with human rights mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>26. The Chief of the Human Rights Council Branch observed that the Council was 
continuing to create new mandates, testifying to their importance and States&#8217; recognition of 
their crucial role. He referred to the Coordination Committee, whose role he considered to 
be currently recognized by the Council. The Secretariat provided advice to the President, 
when personal attacks against mandate holders by States and others occurred during 
meetings.   
</p>
<p>27.  Participants thanked the President of the Human Rights Council for his support and 
recommended that the time available to mandate holders during the interactive dialogue be 
extended. It was also proposed that mandate holders be provided an opportunity to 
participate in general debates. Mandate holders further encouraged the Council to be more 
proactive in following up on country visit reports. The question was raised as to whether 
special procedures, especially country mandates, could provide input into the UPR process, 
as was its role in the follow-up to the UPR outcome. The role of special procedures as an 
early warning mechanism for the Council was discussed. Special procedures urged the 
President to continue to react promptly to personal attacks within and outside the Council 
and support their independence. 
</p>
<p>28. It was pointed out that the differing titles of special procedures mandates (special 
rapporteurs, independent experts and working groups) were considered confusing for 
stakeholders and consistency in nomenclature was needed.3 The important role of country 
offices in follow-up at the national level and in assisting country visits was also highlighted.

 As contemplated in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, annex, para. 59.  </p>


<p><b> VI. Thematic issues and working methods 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Effectiveness of special procedures  
</b></p>
<p>29. Mr. Ted Piccone, Senior Fellow and Deputy Director for Foreign Policy at the 
Brookings Institution, provided a briefing on his study entitled &#8220;The future of the United 
Nations special procedures&#8221;.4 A number of proposals aimed at ensuring that interventions 
by special procedures had maximum impact were put forward. For instance, it was 
suggested that the timing of country visits be determined in close coordination with other 
mechanisms, particularly the UPR. Similarly, identifying key partners at an early stage in 
the preparation of a country visit with a view to ensuring follow-up at the national level was 
considered a means of ensuring that a visit led to change on the ground. The role of the 
United Nations was regarded as critical, in particular at the national level, especially United 
Nations country teams (UNCTs). The study indicated that follow-up visits were effective in 
ensuring that recommendations were not overlooked. There was also a need for better 
follow-up to communications, with the States concerned and the sources.  
</p>
<p>30. Mandate holders asked whether there was increased impact when activities were 
joint; whether there were good practices of engaging with States and others in respect of 
follow-up to recommendations; how to address intimidation of those who provide 
information to mandate holders; whether there was a need to research the effectiveness of 
partnerships with regional mechanisms; and how to make the concept of a &#8220;standing 
invitation&#8221; more meaningful. Strong concern was expressed about ad hominem attacks 
against mandate holders, which constituted intimidation. Mandate holders reiterated their 
freedom to assess situations under their mandates and recalled the duty of States to 
cooperate with them.  
</p>
<p>31. Participants stressed that the credibility and integrity of the special procedures 
system were crucial in ensuring cooperation of the various stakeholders. They pointed to 
the impact that activities, such as focused expert meetings and regional consultations, have. 
Resources for special procedures were discussed, including the possibility of finding ways 
to influence budget discussions in New York. It was also suggested that positive examples 
of the impact of special procedures should be brought to the attention of member States and 
donors.  
</p>
<p>32. Discussions were also held on the conclusions of a workshop organized by Stanford 
University&#8217;s Center on Democracy, Development, and the Rule of Law, with the Brookings 
Institution&#8217;s Foreign Policy Studies Program and Google.org, to advance strategic thinking 
on how to use new technologies to strengthen United Nations human rights monitoring, 
held on 6-7 August 2012 with the participation of a number of mandate holders.5  
</p>
<p>33. Recommendations included the need to use new technologies more effectively; 
make processing of cases taken up by special procedures as communications more victim-
friendly; ensure better follow-up; increase outreach beyond those who traditionally work 
with special procedures and enhance the visibility of the system.

<p><b> B. Enhancing coordination with the special procedures system  
</b></p>
<p>34. Mandate holders welcomed and endorsed draft guidelines on a gender sensitive and 
family-friendly environment for the work of special procedure mandate holders, prepared 
by two mandate holders in close consultations with the Coordination Committee. Noting 
the challenges faced by mandate holders with infants or young children, the draft guidelines 
suggested that United Nations staff rules on breastfeeding be applied to mandate holders; 
that adequate access to United Nations premises be provided to mandate holders&#8217; infants 
and their caregivers; and that appropriate designated areas for breastfeeding be made 
available on United Nations premises. The draft guidelines urged consideration of 
additional budgetary provisions to cover the costs of caregivers when a mandate holder 
travelled with an infant and permission for mandate holders to travel with young children 
older than one, subject to security and other conditions. It was proposed that requests for 
such assistance be reviewed by the Coordinating Committee, which would make 
recommendations to the Secretariat. The meeting called on the Secretariat to support their 
implementation.   
</p>
<p>35.  Mandate holders continued to discuss transparency of financial support provided to 
them from external sources to safeguard their independence, impartiality and integrity.  
They agreed to identify general trends and patterns of external support, which would 
provide a basis for responding to concerns related to external funding. 
</p>
<p>36.  Other working method issues discussed were coordination of joint statements and of 
country visits and a harmonized approach to frequently raised questions on challenges 
confronting mandate holders and the possibility of the development of tools to ensure 
consistency among mandate holders in this context. The Secretariat&#8217;s response to personal 
attacks against mandate holders was also discussed.   
</p>
<p><b> VII. The twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Vienna 
Declaration and Programme of Action 
</b>37.  On 27-28 June 2013 mandate holders taking part in the twentieth annual meeting 
participated in the International Expert Conference on the occasion of the twentieth 
anniversary of the World Conference on Human Rights, Vienna+20 &#8211; Advancing the 
Protection of Human Rights: Achievements, Challenges and Perspectives 20 Years after the 
World Conference, organized by the Austrian Federal Ministry for European and 
International Affairs, in cooperation with OHCHR, the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for 
Human Rights and the European Training and Research Centre for Democracy and Human 
Rights of the University of Graz, Austria.  
</p>
<p>38.  Chaloka Beyani, Chairperson of the Coordination Committee, participated in an 
expert panel, &#8220;Vienna+20. The Way Forward&#8221;, in which he highlighted the contribution of 
special procedures to better promote and protect human rights, and the contents of the 
&#8220;Statement of the United Nations special procedures mandate holders on the occasion of the 
twentieth anniversary of the Declaration and Programme of Action adopted at the World 
Conference on Human Rights in Vienna&#8221;, prepared by the twentieth meeting for the 
International Expert Conference (see annex I).  
</p><p>39.  During the International Expert Conference mandate holders participated in three 
working groups, on (a) strengthening the rule of law: the right to an effective remedy for 
victims of human rights violations; (b) realizing human rights of women universally: </p>


<p>tackling the implementation gap; and (c) mainstreaming human rights: a human rights-
based approach for the post-2015 development agenda.6  
</p>
<p><b> VIII.  Consultations with stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Regional human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>40. Mandate holders interacted with the Council of Europe, the Organization for 
Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Office for Democratic Institutions and 
Human Rights (ODIHR) and the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights.  
</p><p>41. The Deputy Director of ODIHR provided an overview of the geographic scope of 
OSCE which goes beyond Europe with Central Asia and North America fully participating 
and some States from Asia and the Mediterranean region acting as observers. He also 
pointed to the three dimensions of OSCE: security, environment and human rights. Noting 
that it was a consensus-based organization founded on political commitments rather than on 
legally binding obligations, he stressed that the ODIHR mandate was consistent with that of 
special procedures in many areas, including freedom of assembly, human rights defenders, 
trafficking, religion, education, racism and independence of judges and lawyers. The work 
of ODIHR in elections in transition countries was of particular relevance. Together with the 
Council of Europe&#8217;s Venice Commission (European Commission for Democracy through 
Law), ODIHR often reviewed legislation in order to encourage legal frameworks to be 
brought into line with international standards. The importance of enhancing information-
sharing was emphasized, while it was also noted that ODIHR was ready to broaden 
cooperation with special procedures, including through joint recommendations, joint visits 
and joint publications.  
42.  The Director of Human Rights of the Council of Europe noted that the Council was 
a standard-setting organization with 47 member States. A key body was the European Court 
of Human Rights, which issued legally binding judgements. The Council collaborated with 
United Nations treaty bodies and submitted information to the UPR. He encouraged closer 
coordination with special procedures in relation to country visits and exchange of 
information generally.  
</p>
<p>43.  The Head of Communications of the European Union Agency for Fundamental 
Rights described the Agency&#8217;s mandate as follows: provide assistance on fundamental 
rights issues to European institutions and member States and to gather and disseminate 
objective information and data on fundamental rights in the European Union. Specific areas 
of work were access to justice, assistance to victims of crimes, Roma integration, migrants&#8217; 
rights and asylum, rights of the child and racism. He also referred to instances of past 
cooperation with United Nations special procedures, in particular on the right to housing 
and migrants&#8217; rights. 
</p>
<p>44.  Several mandate holders drew attention to the impact of austerity measures in 
European countries, which were sometimes in contradiction with international and 
European human rights norms. They also noted that the economic crisis was associated 
with the revival of racism. Some commented on the fact that bilateral and free trade 
agreements were largely driven by corporations, while civil society had little input. 
Migration was an important issue in Europe and both the Council of Europe and OSCE had 
important roles to play. A framework for monitoring and accountability was needed. One 
mandate holder stressed the fact that Europe had experience in addressing transitional 
</p>

<p>justice issues, including in terms of how history was taught, which could provide useful 
practice for other parts of the world. The work of European mechanisms on gender issues 
was welcomed. Suggestions were made about cooperation with regional organizations in 
Africa, the Americas and Asia. The question of reprisals against human rights defenders 
who cooperated with the United Nations and European human rights institutions was also 
raised.  
</p>
<p>45. Furthermore mandate holders discussed the status of the implementation of the road 
map agreed at the dialogue between the special procedures of the Human Rights Council 
and the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights (ACHPR) on 17-18 January 
2012 in Addis Ababa. The Chairperson of the joint working group to advance and monitor 
the implementation of the Addis Ababa road map briefed the meeting on some of the 
activities carried out since the nineteenth annual meeting in June 2012. He highlighted the 
participation of a number of mandate holders in the ordinary sessions of ACHPR. The 
Chairperson drew attention to the fact that a number of special procedures of the African 
Commission had participated in events convened by United Nations special procedures 
mandate holders. There had been regular exchanges of information, such as notes 
forecasting the relevant activities of both systems; press releases and reports issued by both 
mechanisms; and information on vacant special procedures mandates.  
</p>
<p>46.  During the discussion, mandate holders highlighted the added value of their 
interactions and cooperation with the African human rights mechanisms, particularly the 
special procedures mechanisms. Some mandate holders found it useful to engage with 
government delegations at the regional level on themes or countries falling within their 
mandates; others valued networking with civil society, particularly those active at the 
regional and national level; some mandate holders appreciated the possibility of discussing 
with African special procedures mechanisms issues that had not previously been 
extensively examined by those mechanisms. It was suggested that United Nations special 
procedures mandate holders could consider strengthening partnerships with all the African 
human rights mechanisms, including the African Court on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and 
the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child as well as 
cooperating with subregional level mechanisms in the African continent. Mandate holders 
encouraged partnerships with other regional systems to be pursued gradually on the basis of 
a framework similar to that of the Addis Ababa road map. Interest in exploring further 
avenues for strengthening collaboration with the African special procedures mechanisms 
was expressed by a number of mandate holders in relation to the issues falling within their 
mandates. 
</p>
<p><b> B. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime  
</b></p>
<p>47. A delegation from UNODC outlined its mandate. It was also emphasized that the 
inclusion of a human rights dimension was a priority in combating organized crime.  
</p>
<p>48.  UNODC supported the development of standards and norms relating to crime 
prevention and their implementation, by facilitating police reform, reform of prosecution 
services, the judiciary, improving treatment of victims, providing access to legal aid and 
juvenile justice and combating violence against women. UNODC expressed the desire to 
cooperate more closely with special procedures in areas relating to its mandate, which was 
being expanded by the Crime Commission that has called on it to develop further normative 
frameworks in relation to violence against children and the minimum rules for the treatment 
of prisoners. UNODC had collaborated with several rapporteurs. 
</p>
<p>49.  Mandate holders posed questions on the work of UNODC with respect to replacing 
punishment of persons using drugs with treatment, as well as the use of the death penalty 
for drug-related crimes. Participants also raised the issue of specialized courts for organized </p>


<p>crime, including human trafficking, and underscored the importance of raising awareness 
and training judicial personnel and other stakeholders. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Civil society and non-governmental organizations  
</b></p>
<p>50. Representatives of civil society organizations appreciated the work of mandate 
holders and the opportunity to address the annual meeting. A group of 10 civil society 
organizations, the International Service for Human Rights, Amnesty International, 
Alkarama, Forum-Asia, the Association for the Prevention of Torture, the Baha&#8217;i 
International Community, the World Alliance for Citizen Participation, the World 
Organization against Torture, the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims 
and Human Rights Watch, presented a joint contribution to the meeting. They stressed the 
importance of following up the work of mandate holders, including the follow-up to 
communications and recommendations issued after country visits. Representatives of civil 
society organizations also expressed appreciation for efforts to improve coordination 
including through the Coordination Committee which is largely seen as having a positive 
role in ensuring links with the Human Rights Council and conveying a strong collective 
voice of the special procedures system as a whole. They suggested that the Coordination 
Committee should have a role in the selection and appointment of new mandate holders, 
e.g. outgoing mandate holders could prepare job descriptions based on their experience of 
the mandate. They also highlighted the importance of special procedures, clearly 
articulating what was expected in terms of cooperation by States and developing 
cooperation indicators. They discussed the dilemma between mainstreaming different 
issues throughout the work of several mandates versus focusing on specific themes. Ideas 
that emerged in this regard included the holding of thematic discussions at future annual 
meetings. 
</p>
<p>51. NGO representatives expressed gratitude for the commitment of mandate holders in 
taking up cases of reprisals. It was suggested that the Manual of Operations of the Special 
Procedures be revised to include a section on reprisals.  
</p>
<p>52. Mandate holders expressed their appreciation for the work of civil society 
organizations, underlining that they were central partners in their activities. They asked for 
the views of NGOs on emerging human rights issues, highlighted the need to have 
integrated follow up strategies, at national and international level, including civil society. 
They underlined the role of international civil society organizations in developing the 
capacity of local organizations to disseminate and monitor the implementation of special 
procedures recommendations. Mandate holders also referred to the use of new information 
technology in monitoring and reporting on human rights violations. They recommended 
that the space for civil society organizations to participate in United Nations bodies, in 
particular the Human Rights Council, be strengthened and protected and that their 
contributions be promoted.  
</p>
<p><b> D. National human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p>53. The mandate holders engaged in a dialogue with the Secretary of the International 
Coordinating Committee of National Human Rights Institutions, the Chairperson of the 
National Human Rights Commission of Mauritius, and a member of the National Human 
Rights Council of Morocco. They pointed out that NHRIs constituted a bridge between the 
State and NGOs, and between the international human rights and national protection 
systems. They reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening cooperation with special 
procedures including before, during and after country visits and sharing information on 
human rights situations.  </p>


<p>54. The International Coordination Committee of National Human Rights Institutions 
encouraged NHRIs to send information to special procedures mechanisms, inform them 
when they were under threat and increase participation of mandate holders in conferences 
and events convened by national institutions or the Coordination Committee. The 
International Coordination Committee intended to develop a compilation of good practices 
of collaboration with special procedures. NHRIs regularly encouraged States to issue 
standing invitations to special procedures. It was suggested that the Manual of Operations 
of the Special Procedures be improved by adding guidance on working with NHRIs, and 
that future induction sessions for new mandate holders include information on interaction 
with such institutions. NHRIs and special procedures mechanisms could have greater 
impact through mutual reinforcement particularly if there was timely coordination. 
</p>
<p>55. Mandate holders suggested that NHRIs could disseminate their recommendations on 
special procedures mechanisms, including through their annual reports. Mandate holders 
also noted that special procedures could be consulted in the process of accreditation of 
national institutions. It was recalled that NHRIs had an important role in monitoring human 
rights violations. <b>  </b></p>


<p><b>Annex I  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Statement of the United Nations special procedures mandate 
holders on the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the 
Declaration and Programme of Action adopted at the World 
Conference on Human Rights in Vienna in 1993 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Vienna, 26 June 2013 
</b>On the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Vienna Declaration and 
Programme of Action (VDPA) on 25 June 1993, the special procedures mandate holders, 
<b> Welcome </b>the opportunity to celebrate the achievements in implementing human 
rights since 1993, and to identify and address the remaining gaps and new challenges in 
advancing the protection of human rights; 
</p>
<p><b> Recall </b>that the VDPA: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Makes clear that all human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent and 
interrelated and that the international community must treat human rights globally in 
a fair and equal manner, on the same footing, and with the same emphasis  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Recognizes that it is the duty of States, regardless of their political, economic and 
cultural systems, to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms 
</p>
<p>&#8226; States that the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental 
freedoms must be considered a priority objective of the United Nations, and that the 
promotion and protection of all human rights is a legitimate concern of the 
international community 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Stresses that women&#8217;s rights are human rights and calls for the elimination of 
violence against women 
</p>
<p><b> Also recall</b> that the VDPA is a landmark which provides the framework for the 
consolidation of a strong and effective system of special procedures as a central part of the 
United Nations human rights mechanisms and that it: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Underlines the importance of preserving and strengthening the system of special 
procedures to enable them to carry out their mandates in all countries of the world, 
and providing them with the necessary human and financial resources 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Stresses that the special procedures should be able to harmonize and rationalize their 
work through periodic meetings  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Asks States to cooperate fully with special procedures  
</p>
<p><b> Welcome </b>the progress in the achievement of the goals in the VDPA;  
</p>
<p><b> Recognize,</b> however, that some of these goals have not yet been achieved and new 
challenges for the promotion and protection of human rights have emerged which include 
among others: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Undermining of the universality of human rights, including through the resurgence 
of advocacy for traditional values or cultural relativism  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Financial crisis and the consequences of austerity measures  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Adverse impact of climate change  </p>


<p>&#8226; Impact of privatization on human rights 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Impact of the increasing use of intellectual property rights in free trade agreements 
on human rights  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Impact on human rights of non-governmental entities, such as business enterprises 
or private military and security companies  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Threats on privacy, including through new information communication technologies 
and architecture  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Extreme and growing poverty  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Prevalence and emergence of conflicts   
</p>
<p>&#8226; Consequences of counter-terrorism measures on respect for human rights 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Racism, inequality, and all forms of discrimination  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Interferences in the administration of justice 
&#8226; Limitation of public and democratic space as well as threats, attacks and 
</p>
<p>intimidation of civil society by both States and non-State entities 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Issues related to the increasing mobility of populations, including non-recognition of 
migrants as rights holders 
</p>
<p><b> Stress </b>that special procedures mandate holders confront challenges in discharging 
their mandates which include insufficient implementation and follow-up to their 
recommendations, lack of cooperation of States as well as intimidation and reprisals against 
those who cooperate with them, and paucity of resources; 
</p>
<p><b> Emphasize</b> that these challenges require focused analysis and innovative policy 
responses;  
</p>
<p><b> Reaffirm</b> the continued relevance of the VDPA and its forward-looking agenda for 
human rights, including important commitments and principles that should not be reopened. 
The twentieth anniversary must serve as a platform for moving forward to ensure the full 
enjoyment of human rights by all without discrimination; 
<b> Recommend</b> that States: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Step up their efforts to make human rights a universal reality for all human beings 
on a basis of equality and without discrimination 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensure, in the light of the fact that human rights are one of the three pillars of the 
United Nations, that human rights mainstreaming is a priority and that the human 
rights sector receives commensurate support and resources  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Fully integrate human rights into the post-2015 development agenda, guaranteeing 
that human rights principles, especially equality, non-discrimination, participation 
and accountability, are consistently taken into account in all development measures  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Cooperate fully with special procedures, in particular by accepting requests for 
visits, responding in a timely manner to communications, engaging in a constructive 
dialogue including on all issues and implementing recommendations  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Refrain from any act of intimidation and reprisal against those who cooperate with 
the United Nations in the field of human rights, exercise due diligence to prevent 
non-State entities from such acts, and ensure adequate protection for those that are 
subject to such acts  </p>


<p>&#8226; Enshrine human rights protection in legislation and ensure that the protection of the 
law applies equally, and that all people without discrimination have access to justice 
and remedy 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Reject any attempt to question the universality of human rights through advocacy of 
traditional values or cultural relativism 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Recognize the role of civil society, including human rights defenders, and national 
human rights institutions as key players for the promotion and protection of human 
rights worldwide, including by creating a safe and enabling environment in which 
human rights defenders can operate free from hindrance and insecurity 
</p>
<p><b> Call</b> on the United Nations system as a whole to rely more on the expertise of the 
special procedures and on their early warning capacity; 
</p>
<p><b> Reiterate</b> the VDPA recommendation for cooperation among human rights bodies 
in the United Nations system, including by encouraging the special procedures, human 
rights treaty bodies and the Universal Periodic Review mechanism to work together and 
strengthen their activities towards more effective protection and promotion of human rights.
