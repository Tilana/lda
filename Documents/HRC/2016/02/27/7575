<p><b>Human Rights Council 
Twenty-sixth session 
</b>Agenda item 3 
<b>Promotion and protection of all human rights, civil, 
political, economic, social and cultural rights, 
including the right to development 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Report of the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and 
human rights, Magdalena Sep&#250;lveda Carmona</b> 
<b>Corrigendum 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Paragraph 1, first sentence 
</b></p>
<p>The sentence <i>should</i> <i>read 
</i></p>
<p>Fiscal policies are a tool that States can employ to comply with their international human 
rights obligations. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Paragraph 2, third sentence 
</b></p>
<p>The sentence<i> should</i> <i>read</i>  
</p>
<p>Given that government expenditure has been subject to a considerable amount of analysis 
from the perspective of human rights, the Special Rapporteur will focus on the revenue-
raising side of fiscal policy, in particular taxation. 
</p>
<p><b>3. Paragraph 8 
</b></p>
<p>For the existing text, <i>substitute</i> 
</p>
<p>8. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur explains the scope and content of 
human rights principles and obligations relevant to the formulation of revenue-raising 
policies. She elucidates the minimum requirements with which a State must comply in 
order to fulfil these principles and obligations. After clarifying the crucial functions of tax 
with regard to human rights, she examines different tax measures and practices from a 
human rights perspective.  
</p>
<p><b>4. Paragraph 13, first sentence 
</b></p>
<p>The sentence <i>should</i> <i>read</i>  
</p>
<p>The rights to equality and to non-discrimination should be respected in all State revenue-
raising policies. 
</p>
<p><b>5. Paragraph 16, last sentence

</b></p>
<p><b>2</b>  
</p>
<p>The sentence <i>should</i> <i>read</i> 
</p>
<p>In contrast, a flat tax would not be conducive to achieving substantive equality, as it limits 
the redistributive function of taxation. 
</p>
<p><b>6. Paragraphs 22 and 23 
</b></p>
<p>For the existing text <i>substitute 
</i></p>
<p>22. Decision-making processes regarding tax and public revenues must therefore be 
based on full transparency and the broadest possible national dialogue, with effective and 
meaningful participation of civil society and those who will be directly affected by such 
policies, including people living in poverty.22 Fiscal policies must be subjected to the 
scrutiny of the population during design, implementation and evaluation stages, with the 
various interests transparently identified. This will require capacity-building and fostering 
fiscal literacy in the population. The population must have access to all relevant 
information in an accessible and understandable format,23 and inclusive mechanisms must 
be put in place to ensure that they are actively engaged in devising the most appropriate 
policy options.24 Owing to the asymmetries of power, expertise and interests in this debate, 
specific measures must be taken to ensure equal access and opportunities to participate, 
particularly for people living in poverty.25 
</p>
<p>23. To ensure accountability, fiscal policies (including, for example, tax incentives 
granted to foreign investors) must be open to judicial oversight, while public officials must 
be accountable for decisions that endanger the enjoyment of human rights. Accessible 
mechanisms for complaints and redress must also be put in place. 
</p>
<p><b>7. Paragraph 43, second sentence 
</b></p>
<p>The sentence <i>should</i> <i>read 
</i></p>
<p>For example, according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization (UNESCO), strengthening tax systems is vital to guarantee the right to 
education. 
</p>
<p><b>8. Paragraph 46, first sentence 
</b></p>
<p><i>For</i> Governments <i>read</i> States 
</p>
<p><b>9. Paragraph 47, last sentence 
</b></p>
<p>The sentence <i>should read</i> 
</p>
<p>Thus, although each country&#8217;s situation is different, the higher the prevalence of regressive 
taxes in the mix of revenue-raising sources, the more likely it is that a State will run afoul 
of the principles of equality and non-discrimination and that the minimum essential levels 
of rights enjoyment by the poorest will be threatened.

<p>Tax abuse includes tax evasion, fraud and other illegal practices, including the tax losses 
resulting from other illicit financial flows, such as bribery and money laundering.92

<p>The sentence <i>should read</i> 
</p>
<p>It is important to note, however, that large-scale tax evasion does not take place in a 
domestic vacuum.

</b></p>
<p>The sentence <i>should read</i> 
</p>
<p>In many countries, business enterprises are taxed at a very low rate, even extremely 
profitable large corporations whose success is at least partly attributable to the 
infrastructure, healthy educated workforce and other resources that public funds enable.

</b></p>
<p>The sentence <i>should read 
</i></p>
<p>The owners, managers and creditors of financial institutions were able to reap the full gains 
of &#8220;boom&#8221; times, whereas ordinary taxpayers were expected to shoulder the costs to save 
the sector when it was collapsing, while also enduring austerity measures.93

</b></p>
<p>The sentence <i>should</i> <i>read</i>  
</p>
<p>In particular, high-income States that enable or fail to tackle tax abuse and illicit financial 
flows must shoulder some responsibility for the shortcomings of the tax and public finance 
systems in developing countries and related poverty rates, lack of enjoyment of human 
rights and economic inequalities.
