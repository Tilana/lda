<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. In accordance with his mandate contained in Human Rights Council resolution 6/32, and 
by invitation of the Sri Lankan Government, the Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
human rights of internally displaced persons (hereinafter &#8220;the Representative&#8221;), Walter K&#228;lin, 
conducted an official mission to Sri Lanka from 14 to 21 December 2007.<b>1</b> His main objective 
was to engage in dialogue with the Government with a view to ensuring the full enjoyment of 
human rights of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Sri Lanka by identifying conditions 
necessary for them to achieve durable and sustainable solutions.  
</p>
<p>2. In Colombo, the Representative met with government officials, international organizations, 
non-governmental organizations, civil society and donors. He travelled through Puttalam, 
Vavuniya, Trincomalee and Batticaloa districts, where he met with IDPs and returnees, 
community and religious leaders, government agents, local area security commanders, local and 
international non-governmental organizations and United Nations agencies. He regrets that he 
was unable to visit Kilinochchi to raise humanitarian and protection concerns with the Liberation 
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and to meet IDPs in the Vanni.<b>2</b> While this mission focused on 
those displaced by armed conflict and acts of violence, the Representative recalls those displaced 
by the devastating tsunami of 26 December 2004.  
</p>
<p>3. The Representative appreciates the cooperation of the Government of Sri Lanka, the access 
granted to him to most parts of the country, and the open conversations he had with all 
interlocutors. He is most grateful for the perfect support provided by the United Nations Country 
Team, in particular the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Colombo 
and its field offices. He was well served by the wealth of information provided to him by civil 
society organizations and appreciates the communications he received in advance and during his 
visit. Above all, he thanks the many IDPs who graciously shared their experiences with him 
under difficult circumstances; their courage and dignity left an enduring impression. 
</p>
<p>4. The Representative shared his primary findings with the Government at the conclusion of 
his mission and was encouraged by the willingness of governmental officials to acknowledge 
problems in the response to internal displacement and the protection of IDPs. He particularly 
welcomes the Government&#8217;s prompt consideration of his recommendations through the 
mechanism of the Consultative Committee for Humanitarian Assistance (CCHA). He 
underscores his desire and intention to continue this dialogue.  
</p>
<p><b>II.  GENERAL CONTEXT 
</b></p>
<p>5. Sri Lanka, with its population of 21 million, has been embroiled in an internal armed 
conflict of varying degrees of intensity for the last 25 years. Government policies following 
independence left the Tamil minority feeling increasingly marginalized from the Sinhalese 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  The Vanni denotes areas under LTTE control and roughly includes Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu 
</p>
<p>districts and parts of Jaffna, Mannar and Vavuniya districts. </p>

</p>
<p>majority, and by the 1970s a segment of radicalized Tamil leaders dropped demands for 
increased devolution of powers in Tamil majority areas and instead raised the call for a separate 
state. A segment of this population advocating armed resistance ultimately was consolidated 
under the control of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which has been designated by 
the Government of Sri Lanka and others as a terrorist organization. 
</p>
<p>6. The intervening years have left more than 70,000 dead and many hundreds of thousands 
displaced. Following a ceasefire agreement (CFA) between the Government and the LTTE in 
2002, a period described as &#8220;no war, no peace&#8221;, open hostilities resumed after general elections 
in late 2005. In 2006, government forces regained control of parts of the Eastern Jaffna Peninsula 
and consolidated control of the Eastern Province. Government and military leaders have recently 
announced their intention to reclaim control of the entire island. The theatre of conflict has 
concentrated in the north, and there is increasing potential for mass displacement within and 
from the Vanni. Shortly following the Representative&#8217;s visit, the Government announced its 
formal abrogation of the CFA.  
</p>
<p>7. In 2004, the LTTE commander for the Eastern Province, Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan 
(commonly referred to as Karuna) broke with the LTTE leadership, taking a substantial portion 
of former LTTE cadres with him. The Karuna Faction subsequently registered as a political 
party, the Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal (TMVP). It became clear that Karuna was 
cooperating with the Sri Lankan military and operating with its tacit approval. TMVP 
paramilitary forces operate openly in parts of the Eastern Province. Following a split, the TMVP 
is led by Karuna&#8217;s former deputy, Pillaiyan; Karuna is in custody for immigration fraud in 
Great Britain. In early March, the TMVP won a majority of seats in local elections in Batticaloa.  
</p>
<p><b>A.  International framework 
</b></p>
<p>8. As citizens of their country, IDPs in Sri Lanka remain entitled to all guarantees of 
international human rights and international humanitarian law subscribed to by the State or 
applicable as customary international law.<b>3</b> They do not lose, as a consequence of their 
displacement, the rights of the population at large. At the same time, IDPs have needs and 
vulnerabilities distinct from the non-displaced population, which must be addressed by specific 
protection and assistance measures. These rights are detailed in the Guiding Principles on 
Internal Displacement,<b>4</b> which, though not directly binding, reflect and are consistent with 
international human rights and international humanitarian law. They have been recognized by 
States as &#8220;an important international framework for the protection of internally displaced 
persons&#8221;,<b>5</b> and are increasingly reflected in national laws and policies. The Guiding Principles 
apply equally to non-State actors, including armed groups such as the LTTE and TMVP. 
</p>
<p>

</p>

</p>
<p>para. 6 (c). </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/6/Add.4

</p>
<p>9. The primary duty and responsibility to provide protection to IDPs lies with the national 
authorities, and IDPs have the right to request and receive such protection and assistance from 
the Government (Guiding Principle 3). There may be times when a State does not have the 
capacity to fulfil these obligations, because it either lacks means to do so, or does not have 
de facto control over parts of its territory. In the former case, the State has an obligation to seek 
the assistance of others, particularly international organizations; such support shall be considered 
in good faith and not as interference in a State&#8217;s internal affairs (Guiding Principle 25).  
</p>
<p>10. Furthermore, and without prejudice to their legal status, those who do hold de facto control 
are obliged to respect the rights of IDPs and secure their protection. The Guiding Principles 
&#8220;provide guidance to [&#8230;] all other authorities, groups and persons in their relations with 
internally displaced persons&#8221;. In Sri Lanka, this means that the LTTE is responsible for 
preventing and avoiding actions which could lead to arbitrary displacement, as well as for 
protecting those who are displaced in areas under its control. As a party to the conflict, the LTTE 
is bound by international humanitarian law. As a non-State actor, it is not party to human rights 
treaties, but it is subject to the demand of the international community that &#8220;every individual and 
every organ of society&#8221; respect and promote human rights.<b>6</b> The LTTE has itself recognized this 
responsibility.<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  National context 
</b></p>
<p>11. Sri Lanka is party to the main United Nations human rights conventions and their optional 
protocols, except to the Second Optional Protocol to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
and the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. It has not signed the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. Similarly, while it is 
party to the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, it has not ratified their Additional Protocols, nor 
has it signed the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p>12. The Constitution of Sri Lanka contains a fundamental rights chapter reflecting the rights to 
equal protection before the law, non-discrimination, freedom of movement and choice of 
residence.<b>8</b> Following the assassination of the Foreign Minister in August 2005, a state of 
emergency was declared, and the President has since adopted a series of emergency regulations.

<p>  A/HRC/8/6/Add.4 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>These regulations have had particular bearing on the rights of IDPs, including expanding powers 
of arrest and preventive detention and creating a High Security Zone (HSZ) in Trincomalee and 
along coastal areas.  
</p>
<p>13. Serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the parties to the 
conflict have been noted by the United Nations treaty bodies and mandate holders of the Human 
Rights Council.  
</p>
<p><b>III.  MAGNITUDE AND DYNAMICS OF DISPLACEMENT 
</b></p>
<p>14. Sri Lanka has been affected by cycles of displacement over the past 25 years. International 
attention has largely focused on two phenomena: the 2004 tsunami killed 40,000 persons and 
displaced more than half a million, and the re-escalation of the armed conflict since early 2006 
has displaced more than 308,000. In fact, there remains an equivalent number of Sri Lankans 
(312,000) in situations of &#8220;protracted displacement&#8221;, prior to the 2002 ceasefire.  
</p>
<p>15. Displacement in Sri Lanka is characterized by its fluidity and unpredictability. Mass 
returns were prioritized by the Government and carried out extremely quickly in the East during 
</p><p>2007. In a period of months in mid-2007, more than half of the 308,000 newly displaced returned 
home. Meanwhile as military activities have intensified in the North, there has been more 
displacement. Finally, some IDPs have been displaced more than once, i.e., some of those 
displaced prior to 2002, or displaced by the tsunami, were again displaced by the resumption of 
the armed conflict. In total, however, as of December 2007, the Government estimated that there 
were 577,000 IDPs in Sri Lanka.  
</p>
<p>16. The Representative distinguishes among six situations:  
</p>
<p> (a) IDP returns in Trincomalee and Batticaloa districts. In the period between April 2006 
and March 2007, more than 220,000 persons had to flee their homes as a result of military 
operations in Trincomalee and Batticaloa districts. At the height of the crisis, Batticaloa district 
alone had more than 160,000 IDPs living in 96 temporary IDP sites. Due to government policy, 
since August 2006, roughly 170,000 of these IDPs have returned to their divisions of origin; 
</p>
<p> (b) Continuing displacement since 2006 and 2007 in the Eastern districts. Roughly 
188,000 of the 300,000 displaced since the resumption of hostilities remain in displacement in 
both the North and the East. Those who remain displaced in the East are primarily those from 
areas where there are (i) high security zones, (ii) zones awaiting demining, or (iii) houses or 
villages occupied by security forces. Many of these IDPs are concerned about security, access to 
services and livelihoods. Most are in camps or host families in Batticaloa district, although some 
are in &#8220;transit camps&#8221; in Trincomalee district; 
</p>
<p> (c) Recent displacement in the Northern Province. As a consequence of military 
operations along the FDL (Forward Defence Line), Mannar and Vavuniya districts, the Vanni 
and the Jaffna Peninsula have been the locus of the most recent displacements. By August 2006, 
51,000 persons had registered as newly displaced in Jaffna district, of which 31,000 currently 
remain displaced. Nearly 3,000 newly displaced persons registered in Puttalam during 
2006-2007. Since September 2007, another 22,500 persons were displaced by fighting in the 
north, mostly in Mannar district but also within the Vanni and some within Jaffna and Vavuniya; </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/6/Add.4 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p> (d) Displacement inside the Vanni. In the areas under LTTE control, covering Mullaitivu 
and Kilinochchi districts and parts of Mannar, Vavuniya and Jaffna districts, estimates indicate 
106,000 IDPs, or perhaps one third of the total population. This category overlaps with 
categories (c), (e) and (f) but warrants attention as a distinct category, because these IDPs face 
additional challenges related to freedom of movement and access to services and livelihoods. In 
particular, Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu districts experienced large influxes of IDPs from Jaffna in 
1995 and 1999. The two districts have experienced new displacement since 2006, of 81,000 
arriving from Jaffna, from within the districts, and recently Mannar; 
</p>
<p> (e) Protracted displacement. In Jaffna, Mannar, Puttalam and Vavuniya, there are 
communities of displaced persons who fled their homes due to the conflict 6 to 17 years ago. 
Approximately 312,000 IDPs are in this category. Puttalam and Jaffna provide striking cases. 
Approximately 63,000 northern Muslims have remained in displacement since 1990, living today 
in 141 Government-maintained welfare centres in Puttalam. Another 57,000 are displaced on the 
Jaffna Peninsula, many unable to return because their homes are encompassed in High Security 
Zones which, cumulatively, cover one fifth of the peninsula. Vavuniya hosts more than 
36,000 IDPs, many of whom fled military operations in Jaffna, Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi and 
Mannar districts in the mid- and late-1990s; 
</p>
<p> (f) Displacement caused by the tsunami and other natural disasters. Presently, 
9,000 families remain displaced from the 2004 tsunami and live in 58 welfare camps, primarily 
in the North and East. Up to another 2,000 families have found other living arrangements.  
</p>
<p>17. The vast majority of IDPs find accommodation with host families, often relatives and 
friends, or on vacant land. Thus displacement has a far-reaching effect on many more families 
than the IDPs alone, and these families and their communities play an essential role in 
supporting IDPs that must be recognized and reinforced. Close to 20 per cent of IDPs (98,000) 
live in camps or &#8220;welfare centres&#8221;. Those in welfare centres tend to be those in protracted 
situations. In contrast, during the recent mass displacement in the East, the majority of the 
displaced stayed in 1 of 96 temporary IDP sites set up in schools, temples or mosques, or other 
public buildings or land. In Jaffna, fewer than 10 per cent of IDPs live in 68 welfare centres, with 
the remaining 90 per cent dispersed among family or friends. A similarly low percentage lives in 
welfare centres in Vavuniya, though in Puttalam the majority do live in such centres.  
</p><p>18. The ethnic dimension of displacement cannot be ignored. Because of their geographic 
concentration on the North and East, Tamils have been disproportionately affected by the 
conflict. While Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims constitute 74 per cent, 18 per cent and 7 per cent 
of the population as a whole, figures on the long-term displaced indicate that this population is to 
78 per cent Tamil and 13 per cent Muslim. At the same time, the population of Trincomalee 
historically has been roughly balanced among the three groups. The Representative repeatedly 
heard IDPs describe their fears that patterns of displacement, organized returns and the 
designation of areas as High Security Zones, special economic zones or cultural or religious sites 
are affecting the prior distribution and balance of populations, and tensions among the 
communities are increasing.  </p>

</p>
<p><b>IV.  RESPONSES TO INTERNAL DISPLACEMENT 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Domestic responses 
</b></p>
<p>19. Sri Lanka does not have a specific law or policy comprehensively addressing internal 
displacement. The Representative was informed that a law on protection and assistance to IDPs 
is being considered. 
</p>
<p>20. Several ministries have responsibilities for displacement-related issues. The Ministry of 
Disaster Management and Human Rights (MDM&amp;HR) coordinates among government actors, 
including ministries and the military, and also between national and international actors. The 
Ministry of Resettlement and Disaster Relief Services (MR&amp;DRS) has primary responsibility for 
camps and welfare centres and the provision of essential services including assistance to the 
long-term displaced. It has played a central role in the return process in the East. The Ministry of 
Nation Building and Development and Estate Infrastructure (MNB&amp;DEI) has responsibility for 
registration of IDPs, which is implemented through the Government Agent (GA), and distributes 
food provided by WFP to the newly displaced. The Secretariat for Coordinating the Peace 
Process (SCOPP), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Defence also participate 
in formulating official policies and responses to displacement. Early last year, legislation 
established a Resettlement Authority under the Ministry of Resettlement, charged with 
formulating a resettlement policy and coordinating governmental and non-governmental actors 
&#8220;in order to end displacement of persons&#8221;.<b>9</b> Its authorizing legislation grants power in the areas 
of documentation, property disputes, housing, education and health infrastructure, recovery, 
development and livelihoods. However, it neither indicates substantive standards nor assigns 
accountability for implementation in relation to other governmental actors. The Authority is not 
yet operational.  
</p>
<p>21. The GA is the key authority at the district level and is responsible for shelter, rations, 
water/sanitation, and access to health and education services. The GA, along with the Divisional 
Secretary (DS) and district and national Registrar offices, is responsible for issuance of national 
identity cards (NIC) and other personal documentation.  
</p>
<p>22. The Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission has an IDP Unit with field offices that provide 
assistance to IDPs, especially in the area of arrest and detention and personal documentation. 
Mobile documentation clinics have helped many obtain needed documents, but requests have by 
far exceeded processing capacity, leaving a lengthy backlog.  
</p>
<p>23. The Representative did not obtain information concerning government allocations for 
assistance and protection to IDPs. Government compensation is sometimes provided to victims 
of the armed conflict, including the displaced, but compensation appears to be allocated in 
response to particular incidents, on an ad hoc basis. As for daily needs, the Government relies 
heavily on international organizations to supply food and non-food humanitarian assistance, as 
well as emergency and transitional shelter and infrastructure for resettlement or relocation 
</p>

</p>
<p>projects.<b>10</b> Most immediate emergency assistance is provided by international agencies and 
NGOs. The Government provides limited funding for the Human Rights Commission, with 
growing reliance on funds from the international community.  
</p>
<p>24. Following the majority of returns in the East, MR&amp;DRS developed a six-month 
post-resettlement emergency assistance plan. The Representative heard concerns that the plans 
had been developed at the central level, without consultation of IDPs. He was advised that 
MNB&amp;DEI is developing a three-year plan of recovery for the East and that a new initiative is 
addressing land rights.  
</p>
<p>25. Two primary coordination mechanisms exist between the Government and humanitarian 
actors. The Consultative Committee on Humanitarian Assistance (CCHA) is a high-level forum 
for coordination and policymaking led by the Minister of Disaster Management and Human 
Rights and attended by key ministries, United Nations and key bilateral donors. There are 
subcommittees on IDP resettlement and welfare, logistics and essential services, livelihoods, 
health and education. MDM&amp;HR also chairs a monthly IDP coordination meeting which allows 
humanitarian agencies to raise operational and protection concerns with ministries, government 
agents and security forces.  
</p>
<p>26. A potentially powerful initiative is the cooperation between MDM&amp;HR and UNHCR to 
develop guidelines on &#8220;Confidence Building and Stabilization Measures for Internally Displaced 
Persons in the North and East of Sri Lanka&#8221;. These measures aim to reduce tensions between 
communities, as well as strengthen communication and confidence between the civilian 
population and civil administration and armed forces, through targeted inventions such as 
establishing civil-military liaison committees; capacity-building and training in human rights and 
international humanitarian law; disseminating information on government programmes and 
policies; promoting community participation; village profiling to identify obstacles to durable 
solutions; supporting reconstruction and livelihoods through quick impact projects; and 
reviewing existing restitution and compensation schemes for resolving land and property 
disputes. An Action Plan was endorsed by the CCHA in October 2007, and at the time of the 
Representative&#8217;s visit, administrative structures were being established but implementation has 
been slow, in part due to lack of government allocations.  
</p>
<p>27. While these efforts show the Government&#8217;s willingness to improve existing efforts, 
significant structural obstacles hinder the national response. First, there is evident confusion 
among responsible actors, as responsibilities are dispersed and accountability not clearly 
established. Second, policies on matters such as return and the emergency and development 
plans for the East have been made in Colombo, without consultation of the communities 
affected, and this appears to be general practice. Third, policy decisions taken in Colombo, such 
as those affecting access of NGOs, are not always effectively communicated and implemented at 
the local level, especially military authorities. The outcomes of the CCHA are not public, 
undermining transparency and accountability. In addition, where plans have been adopted, more 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>10
</b>  The 2008 Common Humanitarian Action Plan (CHAP), which is the international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian community&#8217;s strategy for essential interventions, requests over US$ 68 million for 
food aid and nearly US$ 36 million for shelter and non-food relief items. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/6/Add.4

</p>
<p>can be done to empower local actors, especially civilian authorities. Finally, the lack of 
comprehensive and uniform policies on key matters, particularly compensation and assistance, 
has led to ad hoc and piecemeal responses. 
</p>
<p>28. The Representative was impressed by the vibrant civil society, which plays an essential 
role in protecting and assisting IDPs. He is concerned that insecurity still impedes access for 
humanitarian agencies and NGOs and threatens the safety of their staff. The commitment of 
national staff is remarkable. Many undertake significant risk, as humanitarian workers have been 
the targets of violence including killings, abductions and disappearances, as well as intimidation 
and extortion. The Representative remains concerned that an air of mistrust of international 
humanitarian organizations and national NGOs, especially voiced by a vocal minority of 
government officials, pervades the public discourse. So long as such criticism remains 
unchallenged by those in positions of authority, it will continue to hamper this valuable work and 
pose a risk to the well-being of all humanitarian workers.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  The international community 
</b></p>
<p>29. Pursuant to the Government&#8217;s request, UNHCR is the lead international agency for IDPs in 
Sri Lanka. For the conflict-displaced, UNHCR engages in contingency planning and emergency 
response and provides protection and humanitarian assistance. It is also implementing 
confidence-building and stabilization activities for all IDP communities, with an additional 
emphasis on the search for solutions for those in protracted displacement.  
</p>
<p>30. International agencies have not adopted the cluster approach,<b>11</b> although UNHCR 
coordinates efforts in the areas of protection, camp coordination and management (shelter), and 
non-food relief. UNICEF leads sectoral groups on water, sanitation, education and nutrition; 
WFP on logistics and food security; WHO on health; UNDP on early recovery; and OCHA 
supports coordination. 
</p>
<p>31. At the national level, UNHCR chairs the IDP Protection Working Group. It has provided a 
forum for addressing protection concerns, particularly through joint advocacy efforts, including 
its <i>Study on Forced Displacement, Freedom of Movement, Return and Relocation</i>, adopted by 
the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC).<b>12</b> The study detailed specific incidents of forced 
displacement and forced return in 2006-2007, and made recommendations to all relevant actors 
based upon national and international legal norms. The IASC is a forum for overall coordination 
of the work of the humanitarian community, including contingency planning and fund-raising, 
and it has been an important platform for public advocacy on the protection of civilians, 
consultation of IDPs in the return process and the imperatives of humanitarian access and 
protection of humanitarian workers.

</p>
<p>32. The cooperative and supportive role of the international community could be strengthened 
by greater consultation and transparency on the part of national authorities. In some instances, 
this cooperation has been strong, such as with the development of the Confidence Building and 
Stabilization Measures. In other cases, including the early stages of the return process in the 
East, the international community was not always timely informed or consulted on the 
Government&#8217;s plans, and had to respond to critical humanitarian needs of the population with 
little or no notice.  
</p>
<p>33. Until recently, international organizations tended to focus on emergency humanitarian 
relief or development initiatives, with a gap in attention to transitional measures needed for early 
recovery and resolution of protracted displacement. The Representative is pleased at indications 
that this is changing. He strongly encourages organizations proposing livelihood initiatives and 
other elements necessary to provide durable solutions, and hopes that donors will fund these 
programmes. Most notably, the World Bank, in conjunction with MR&amp;DRS, recently began 
implementing a project to assist approximately 40 per cent of the long-term displaced in 
Puttalam district through cash grants for the construction of homes. While from a development 
perspective, it is understandable that this project targets families who have made a similar 
investment of their own, through prior acquisition of land rights, it is precisely those who cannot 
make such an investment who are the most vulnerable. Additional projects are needed to assist 
these groups. A concerted and coordinated approach among the international community and 
national authorities, that would address the housing needs of all IDPs, as well as access to 
livelihoods and income-generating activities, would go a long way in improving the living 
conditions of many IDPs and, for some, in finding a durable solution.  
</p>
<p><b>V.  FINDING DURABLE SOLUTIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  General remarks 
</b></p>
<p>34. Despite their disparate circumstances, all of the IDPs the Representative met expressed a 
common desire to lead their lives in safety and security, with access to livelihoods and basic 
services. Accordingly, this report aims to identify those obstacles to durable and sustainable 
solutions that must be addressed in order to allow IDPs and returnees to regain their lives. 
</p>
<p>35. In accordance with Guiding Principles 14 (a) and 28, IDPs have the right to choose among 
three durable solutions: (i) return to their place of origin (commonly referred to as &#8220;resettlement&#8221; 
in Sri Lanka), (ii) integration in the area of displacement, or (iii) relocation to another part of the 
country (what the Guiding Principles refer to as &#8220;resettlement&#8221;). The decision to return shall be 
voluntary and informed, and the return itself conducted in a manner that ensures the safety and 
dignity of the individuals involved. Moreover, authorities have an affirmative obligation to 
facilitate the integration of IDPs into the social, cultural and economic life of the community, 
regardless of the solution chosen.  
</p>
<p>36. Substantive conditions necessary to sustain any durable solution include: (i) physical 
security, (ii) full protection of the law, specifically non-discrimination on the basis of prior 
displacement; access to national and local protection mechanisms including police and courts; 
restored access to personal documentation; and access to property restitution or compensation 
mechanisms; (iii) matters affecting the ability of IDPs to (re)integrate economically, socially and </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/6/Add.4 
  page 13 
 
</p>
<p>culturally, including access to shelter, livelihoods, and basic services. At the same time, the 
process leading to durable solutions must ensure that IDPs receive relevant information and are 
consulted on envisaged solutions.<b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>37. The Representative has found that failure to effectively address IDPs&#8217; concerns may 
jeopardize the possibility and sustainability of peace. When IDPs are not able to recover their 
property, or to otherwise find solutions allowing them to live decent lives, and when they feel 
that they have suffered injustice without redress, prospects for reconciliation diminish. Similarly, 
the exclusion of IDPs from political participation reinforces feelings of marginalization and 
undermines the legitimacy of governments. In contrast, resolution of such issues can be a 
positive force for social rehabilitation and peacebuilding. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Safety 
</b></p>
<p>38. The first and overwhelming concern of both returnees and those still in displacement is 
physical security. The Representative was struck by the pervasive, often disabling, sense of fear 
among those he met. Whether they have returned to their communities, are in camps or transit 
sites, or are travelling, IDPs feel at risk. This is not limited to the newly cleared areas of the East; 
rather, he received reports of extrajudicial killings, physical assault, abduction, disappearances, 
forced recruitment and harassment in all areas he visited. He was particularly affected by the 
many women among the IDPs and returnees who told him about husbands or sons who had been 
murdered, abducted or arrested with no information on their whereabouts.  
</p>
<p>39. Sources of insecurity are varied. They include disappearances allegedly by all parties; 
abductions by unidentified actors; continued incursions and attacks by the LTTE, including 
claymore mine explosions; threats and attacks by irregular armed groups including the TMVP; 
tactics used by security forces including roundups, identification techniques, and detentions 
without notification to family of the reasons for and location of detention; looting; and 
incomplete mine-clearance.  
</p>
<p>40. Camps and transit sites in the East, in particular, are subject to harassment by 
paramilitaries, primarily the TMVP. The Representative received reports about lootings in plain 
sight as well as abductions. Shelter material has been stolen in large quantities. At one camp, 
metal sheeting protecting the toilets and bathing area was completely gone, and women had 
nowhere to go in safety and privacy. Where residents witnessed an abduction or killing and 
admitted knowing the responsible party, they stated that they would be killed if they spoke of it. 
IDPs reported abductions by armed elements for forced labour; they also complained of common 
practice among TMVP and Special Task Force (STF) to appropriate IDPs&#8217; bicycles for their own 
use. IDPs complained that civilian police refuse to enter the camps at night, although in many 
instances there are army or STF outposts nearby.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>13
</b>  The specific problem of finding durable solutions for those in protracted displacement is 
</p>
<p>addressed separately below. </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/6/Add.4 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>41. In some areas returnees seemed at greater risk, as the harassment appeared to be more 
systematic and conducted jointly by security forces and TMVP. As part return to areas formerly 
under LTTE-control, it was practice to screen the IDPs, to photograph, fingerprint and &#8220;register&#8221; 
them, and then issue an IDP (returnee) card to be carried at all times, identifying the place of 
origin. Often screening was conducted by military in the presence of masked men. Return 
communities were subjected to cordon and search operations, particularly following security 
incidents such as the shooting of a soldier or a claymore explosion. Searches often occur at night. 
One community had experienced this three times in four months: they described how everyone 
was taken to the village centre, houses searched, women stripped and beaten, and more than a 
dozen men arrested after being identified by men wearing masks. Everyone in the village now 
sleeps together. Confidence in the security forces is undermined by routine disregard of 
procedures for arrest and detention, including notification of family members of the reasons for 
and location of the individual&#8217;s detention. The fact that women simply do not know where their 
son or husband is, who he is with, or why he was taken, turns their fear into terror. Ultimately, 
when asked, returnees said that they felt less - rather than more - secure due to the presence of 
the many army and STF outposts that had cropped up in return and transit areas.  
</p>
<p>42. The Representative acknowledges that the State faces legitimate and serious security 
concerns, which it furthermore bears the responsibility to address. A military official has 
indicated that it is for their own safety that returnees are screened, fingerprinted and issued 
special identity cards. However, the impact of such a pervasive military presence, and the heavy 
procedures used, has been to severely restrict and control movement of IDPs and returnees and 
undermine their own sense of security. In some instances, men are made to report to the nearby 
army camp on a daily basis and told to report their whereabouts if they do not intend to return at 
night. Movement may be prohibited after 7 p.m. The resulting fear and vulnerability have 
broad-ranging consequences for IDPs&#8217; and returnees&#8217; ability to regain normal and self-sustaining 
lives. Families fear sending men to work, or boys and girls to school, noting that men and boys 
had been abducted or detained, and girls harassed, when passing military camps or checkpoints.  
</p>
<p>43. Entire communities now feel under suspicion because of their place of origin or ethnicity, 
rather than on the basis of individual behaviour. IDPs are asked for their identity cards at 
checkpoints, and Tamil IDPs feel that they are interrogated and searched while Sinhalese 
travellers are not. Moreover, they feel that they have no recourse when wrongs are committed, 
because the civilian police are not there or they fear retaliation. The lack of prosecution of 
serious crimes has further bred a sense of impunity and increasing alienation.  
</p>
<p>44. The Government has recognized some of these problems and taken some action. Some 
officials recognize the importance of promptly restoring civilian administration in the East. The 
Representative particularly welcomes efforts to recruit local and Tamil-speaking police and train 
existing officers. He urges a similar emphasis on recruiting women officers. Increased civilian 
police presence - particularly police who know the community and can speak its language - is 
essential. It is hoped that the Confidence Building and Stabilization Measures<i>, </i>when 
implemented, will improve both IDPs&#8217; and returnees&#8217; security and confidence in the State to 
protect them.  
</p>
<p>45. However, additional measures are needed. The Government must re-establish safety and 
security in all IDP and return areas, protecting the civilian population against all forms of 
harassment, physical harm and abduction, regardless of the source. Clear accountability for these </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/6/Add.4 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>crimes would help reduce their occurrence and confer a necessary degree of public confidence in 
the Government&#8217;s ability to protect its citizens. The Government must re-establish the authority 
of the civilian police and ensure compliance with procedural protections guaranteed by national 
and international law, including the Presidential Directives on Arrest and Detention. The 
physical presence and accessibility of police could be expanded through mobile patrols. Other 
innovations might be considered: elsewhere, for example, IDPs have received improved access 
to civil and criminal protection mechanisms through the deployment of joint teams of police, 
human rights commission staff and protection staff of an international organization or NGO. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>46. The continued prevalence of landmines in areas of return requires urgent attention. Posing 
an obvious threat to life, the presence of landmines and unexploded ordnance also affects 
returnees&#8217; freedom of movement and access to livelihoods. The Representative is gravely 
concerned about reports that some returns occurred before low risk certificates were issued. 
While placing returnees at unacceptable risk, humanitarian organizations were denied access to 
these areas for this very reason. In addition, demining was completed to facilitate return to 
residential areas, but insufficiently in surrounding areas, so that IDPs could not safely resume 
their farming or fishing, or access forests for firewood. While it appears that initially timetables 
for return may have been used to pressure demining teams, the Government has recognized 
demining as a priority in return planning and has improved its coordination in this regard.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Housing and property 
</b></p>
<p>47. Housing and property raise several discrete but equally important issues. From the moment 
of displacement, most IDPs have immediate assistance needs stemming from the loss of their 
homes and land. IDPs have the right to an adequate standard of living, one component of which 
is basic shelter and housing. After the emergency phase, authorities bear an additional 
responsibility to establish the conditions that allow IDPs to find durable solutions and rebuild 
their lives. Repairing and reconstructing homes, or providing alternate permanent shelter, is a 
part of this.  
</p>
<p>48. Notably, what may be considered &#8220;adequate&#8221; shelter during an emergency phase becomes 
unacceptable the longer the situation endures. Adequately responding to the phases between 
emergency shelter, transitional shelter and permanent housing is challenging, but the continued 
hope that IDPs will soon find durable solutions cannot excuse even temporary living conditions 
that are substandard. Visiting welfare centres in Puttalam and Vavuniya and transit sites in 
Trincomalee, the Representative was seriously concerned. The welfare centres were intended as 
transitional shelter many years ago but have become de facto permanent housing. A second 
generation of IDPs now lives there in overcrowded, dilapidated structures, without sufficient 
sanitation. Families came to temporary transit sites such as Killiveddi on the promise that they 
would be there briefly while homes were being repaired. Instead, they remain in overcrowded 
and inhospitable conditions, many months later, still with no indication when they might go 
home. The Representative witnessed whole families crowded into one small open room, with 
only a tarp on the hard earth, rain seeping through the roof and penetrating sleeping areas. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>49. Distinct from the right to adequate shelter, protection of IDPs&#8217; housing, land and property 
rights is an essential component of durable solutions. IDPs are entitled to restitution or 
compensation for their property, regardless of whether they choose to return, integrate locally or 
relocate. Many IDPs in the East could not return to their homes. Houses were occupied by the </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/6/Add.4 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>Army or fell within camp perimeters or buffer zones. A mother, camping on the outskirts of her 
village, explained: &#8220;We are resettled (returned) now but still live in displacement.&#8221; These IDPs 
had no information about when they might reclaim their homes or receive compensation.  
</p>
<p>50. A much larger group of IDPs have been affected by the establishment of HSZs in Jaffna 
and, more recently, in Muttur East/Sampur, Trincomalee. Collectively, HSZs in the North and 
East have displaced more than 120,000 people. Though the Government indicated plans to 
release some land in the Muttur East zone, IDPs in the transit sites had not themselves been 
informed of this fact or the time frame for return. To the Representative&#8217;s knowledge, no one had 
received compensation for loss of their land or home in an HSZ.  
</p>
<p><b>D.  Livelihoods and basic services 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Representative noted significant problems in the timely delivery, quality, quantity and 
nutritional variety of food. The Government administers the regular food assistance scheme and 
controls distribution, although most of the input is provided by the World Food Programme, 
and humanitarian NGOs supply emergency and supplemental assistance. He was informed that 
insufficient rations fixed on prices of 20 years ago would be reviewed. He urges that the 
Government undertake a comprehensive review of basic assistance and that the system of 
entitlements be rationalized and standardized. Long delays should be eliminated and better 
access provided to WFP and humanitarian organizations. He noted disparities in rations based 
upon the geographic location, length and cause of displacement and size of the family, which are 
issues unrelated to IDPs&#8217; basic humanitarian needs. He also noted a need for essential non-food 
items. Some women in camps and transit sites had no soap and no sanitary supplies. 
</p>
<p>52. IDPs in return areas remain almost entirely dependent upon humanitarian assistance. Due 
to the declaration of HSZs and other restrictions, whole communities of fishermen cannot access 
the sea, or they are restricted from fishing at night, when catches are best. Insecurity, HSZs, 
incomplete demining and military occupation of land also restrict access to fields and forests. 
Many farmers are idle simply because they had lost their tools, seeds and livestock during their 
displacement, and now lack the means to replace them. At the time of the Representative&#8217;s visit, 
UNHCR had quick impact projects for livelihoods, as well as UNDP and FAO, and the 180-day 
plan for the East mentioned the need to prioritize agriculture and fishing, but this cannot begin to 
have the needed reach. Whole communities literally had nothing to do. The Representative 
encourages the Government, with support of the international community, to make extensive 
efforts to restore livelihoods (rehabilitating and improving access to land; replacing lost assets) 
and to provide training and assistance to develop income-generating activities for the large 
portion of displaced who previously worked as day labourers. Particular attention should be paid 
to developing opportunities for the most vulnerable, especially female-headed households.  
</p>
<p>53. The Representative saw some achievements in access of IDPs to basic services. In general, 
IDPs had equal and non-discriminatory (vis-&#224;-vis the non-displaced population) access to health 
and education facilities, although insecurity inhibited some from accessing these services. 
Pending restoration of security and freedom of movement, mobile medical clinics should be 
considered to address immediate needs. In return areas, efforts were under way to restore and 
extend basic services - a particular challenge in formerly LTTE-controlled areas lacking 
infrastructure. Nonetheless, he notes that IDPs must have access to basic sanitation, health and 
education services at the time of their return.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/6/Add.4 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Inter-communal tensions 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Representative was concerned by mistrust he saw among different communities and 
groups of IDPs. While some tensions are deep-seated, certain policies inadvertently exacerbate 
these tensions. The Confidence Building and Stabilization Measures introduce programmes to 
build trust (e.g.<i>,</i> peace committees and IDP advisory groups; peaceful coexistence measures 
including student exchanges), but targeted measures are needed to eliminate sources of tension.  
</p>
<p>55. It is natural for tensions to develop when host communities are under significant strain 
themselves, or when assistance to IDPs appears to favour IDPs over non-displaced who are 
similarly situated. Puttalam is economically disadvantaged, with comparatively high levels of 
unemployment. Although it has hosted a large community of northern IDPs for 17 years, public 
allocations for those IDPs continue to be paid to their districts of origin. Given the size of the 
IDP population in relation to the entire community and the length of displacement, a review of 
assumptions underlying budget allocations is warranted.  
</p>
<p>56. A second challenge is designing aid programmes to target specific needs and 
vulnerabilities of IDPs when there are large needs within the host community. The World Bank 
project importantly recognizes that a singular focus on IDPs would fan existing tensions; 
accordingly, it provides some housing and infrastructure to the non-displaced host community as 
well. A new health centre also meets increased demand attributable to the IDPs but serves all 
members of the community equally.  
</p>
<p>57. The Representative also observed tensions among groups of IDPs. In Puttalam, &#8220;old&#8221; IDPs 
perceived the arrival of &#8220;new&#8221; IDPs from the East as fomenting an increase in disappearances, 
roundups, arrests and detentions. In Muttur, restricted access to fishing grounds and HSZs 
resulted in officials directing Muslim fisherman to traditional Tamil fishing areas. Similarly, 
IDPs throughout Sri Lanka were keenly aware that different groups receive different assistance 
packages. Though the disparities may not be intentional, where these differences seem arbitrary - 
or worse, where they appear to favour one ethnic group over another, this fuels inter-communal 
tensions and mistrust of the authorities. A uniform and standardized approach to assistance and 
entitlements - whose determinants are the needs and vulnerabilities of the beneficiaries - coupled 
with greater transparency about entitlements and the requirements and procedures for obtaining 
them, would have the additional benefit of eliminating this source of mistrust and, ultimately, 
insecurity.  
</p>
<p><b>F.  Cross-cutting issues 
</b></p>
<p><b>Documentation and freedom of movement 
</b></p>
<p>58. Documentation is especially important for IDPs because it is often instrumental in assuring 
their access to public services, entitlement to humanitarian assistance, and ability to exercise 
freedom of movement. Without extreme care, procedures and systems relating to documentation 
can effectively deny IDPs these rights or become vehicles for discrimination and abuse. The 
Representative found not only that there were difficulties for IDPs to obtain and retain needed 
documentation, but also that documentation was used inappropriately by some authorities.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/6/Add.4 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>59. The National Identity Card (NIC) is the key piece of personal identification for 
Sri Lankans. It is used for all official interaction the individual has with the State. Because IDPs 
commonly have lost personal documentation, authorities must provide clear and accessible 
procedures for the prompt replacement of NICs at the site of displacement.  
</p>
<p>60. IDP registration may be used as a temporary form of identification, but cannot substitute 
for prompt replacement of the IDP&#8217;s NIC, to which IDPs are entitled as citizens. Not all 
countries use IDP registration, but where it is used, registration can be important in its own right: 
for the IDP, it is a marker of entitlement to assistance, and for the government and humanitarian 
community, it is a powerful tool for planning and delivering assistance. Aggregated data 
supports the adequacy and appropriateness of emergency response, allocation of central 
resources for public services and planning for durable solutions.  
</p>
<p>61. Presently there is no comprehensive, uniform system of registration, resulting in a number 
of difficulties, since registration is used to establish entitlement to government assistance.<b>14</b> 
Varying standards are applied for registration and deregistration. IDPs staying with friends or 
families, as well as those originating from areas approved for return, are not registered. In 
accordance with the principle of non-discrimination, where aid eligibility is dependant upon 
registration status, all IDPs meeting the factual description in the Guiding Principles should be 
eligible for registration, regardless of date or place of displacement or place of accommodation. 
Registration cards should be issued to each IDP individually and in the case of women, in their 
own names. Finally, procedures should be simplified and information centralized such that IDPs 
can move freely and not risk losing their assistance. IDPs reported difficulty with a requirement 
that they deregister at the first site of displacement before registering at the second site because 
either they could not return in safety, or the local authority was reluctant to deregister the IDP 
because it would reduce the amount of assistance the area received. A centralized system would 
facilitate a single step to transfer registrations, and uniform standards would prevent premature 
deregistration or manipulation. 
</p>
<p>62. The Representative was concerned that additional registration and identification 
requirements were imposed on returnees in the East. There was a practice to screen, register and 
issue family photo ID cards during the process of return. Screening often involved the use of 
masked men to identify individuals who were then photographed and fingerprinted. Lists were 
then distributed among checkpoints. Individuals have been closely monitored upon their return, 
with some men required to report to security forces on a daily basis; villages are checked to 
ensure everyone returns at night and that only those on the ID card are present. Many IDPs 
indicated that they limited their movements, lest they be asked for these ID cards at checkpoints 
and then questioned or harassed.  
</p>
<p>63. These ID cards, and ID cards required by the Army or STF in some areas, do not appear to 
serve a legitimate purpose. IDP or returnee status per se is not a reasonable basis for suspicion of 
illegal activity, nor for restricting freedom of movement. For identification and freedom of 
movement, it should be sufficient that IDPs carry a NIC. Requiring IDPs/returnees to show 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>14
</b>  Emergency assistance prior to receiving the registration card is provided by NGOs and 
</p>
<p>international organizations.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/6/Add.4 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>identification that singles them out based on this status is discriminatory, and it has led to abuse. 
The Government must clarify the purpose of any registration, identification or data collection. 
There may be important and appropriate reasons for doing so, but these must serve the purpose 
of meeting the needs and fulfilling the rights of IDPs.  
</p>
<p><b>Information and consultation 
</b></p>
<p>64. IDPs had not been consulted on their needs, interests and concerns in key areas - whether 
assistance, plans for return, compensation or other issues affecting durable solutions. Even more, 
IDPs have little access to information on these matters. One family, waiting for months in a 
transit centre, said that they did not know about the status of their land, now encompassed within 
the Muttur HSZ: as such, they were simply unable to conceive of the future. IDPs in Puttalam 
had not had any interaction with government officials for years; they, too, appeared in limbo. In 
the early stages of the return process in the East, whole communities were simply informed after 
their villages were declared ready for return. They were not assisted to assess conditions for 
themselves; nor were they consulted about their needs and intentions. Subsequently, &#8220;go and 
see&#8221; visits have been arranged for some communities, but this is not sufficient. Where IDPs did 
not have basic information - about security and physical conditions in their villages; the process 
for return including what assistance they would receive; and what choices were available if they 
did not wish to return - their return cannot be said to comply with the required standards of 
voluntariness.  
</p>
<p>65. The Representative recalls that extensive consultation and information-sharing with IDPs 
has been undertaken in Sri Lanka in the past, following the tsunami. Presently he is encouraged 
that communication and community involvement have been identified as core activities for the 
Confidence Building and Stabilization Measures<i>. </i>He also acknowledges that some important 
improvements were made in the return process, including distribution of information notices and 
the organization of some &#8220;go and see&#8221; visits. These efforts are positive, but not sufficient. 
</p>
<p>66. A systematic approach must be developed to ensure consistent consultation and 
information-sharing with IDPs. IDPs have a fundamental right to participate in decisions 
affecting their lives.<b>15</b> For responsible authorities, the information gained can improve the 
effectiveness of the response. For IDPs, consultation enhances feelings of participation and trust. 
Information sharing, complete, timely and accessible, is furthermore essential to allow IDPs to 
make voluntary, informed and therefore sustainable decisions regarding their futures.  
</p>
<p><b>Humanitarian access 
</b></p>
<p>67. The primary duty and responsibility for providing humanitarian assistance to IDPs lies 
with national authorities. International organizations, however, play an important role in 
supporting the Government to meet these responsibilities, especially where governments are 
unable or unwilling to provide necessary assistance. In Sri Lanka the support of international and 
national humanitarian organizations has indeed been essential, especially in the areas of 
emergency shelter, food and non-food relief items.  
</p>

</b>  See for example<i>, </i>Guiding Principles 18 (3) and 28 (2).  </p>

</p>
<p>68. While humanitarian access has improved somewhat in the East, some humanitarian 
organizations still do not enjoy full access to all areas of return, and access in the North is 
increasingly difficult. Decisions made at the CCHA have not always been respected in practice, 
and agencies find themselves delayed by cumbersome and changing procedures. In the East, 
organizations are often subject to two levels of approval, on a project-by-project basis, by the 
GA and the area security commander. The Representative is concerned that agencies engaged in 
protection activities find it much more difficult to obtain access than those providing material 
assistance. Serious and legitimate security concerns may occasionally dictate temporary 
restrictions on access, but such restrictions should be the exception and not the rule. Moreover, 
once an area is deemed safe for the return of civilians, safety should not be a basis for the 
exclusion of humanitarian actors.<b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>69. Increased transparency - for example, better communication and coordination between the 
Government and international agencies and humanitarian NGOs in advance of returns - would 
significantly improve the timeliness and adequacy of the humanitarian response. The 
Representative noted above his deep concern for the safety of humanitarian workers and his 
regret at the sentiment of mistrust apparent in the media. In this regard, he welcomes the 
adoption of Guiding Principles for Humanitarian and Development Assistance in Sri Lanka, 
subscribed to by the Government of Sri Lanka, the United Nations, and major donors and 
international agencies. These Principles acknowledge the common humanitarian objectives of all 
signatories, as well as their commitment to key principles such as non-discrimination and 
impartiality in activities and assistance, consultation and participation of affected communities, 
and unrestricted access to all people in need of assistance.  
</p>
<p><b>National policy and institutions 
</b></p>
<p>70. An abundance of institutions are involved in the response, but without a clear designation 
of roles. This diminishes efficacy because actors are uncertain regarding (i) who has the 
authority in certain circumstances, and (ii) who ultimately bears responsibility and 
accountability. Existing coordination structures provide valuable opportunity to share concerns, 
but without the element of accountability they have not always resulted in sufficient cooperation 
among all actors or implementation. 
</p>
<p>71. Linked to institutional fragmentation, the Representative found that the response to various 
aspects of displacement tends to be piecemeal and ad hoc. This is particularly true for policies on 
assistance (rations and shelter) and compensation for loss of property and livelihoods. In some 
areas, such as IDP registration, there is an absence of common standards or disparity in their 
application. These gaps and inconsistencies leave needs unmet and are susceptible to an 
interpretation of indifference or even of bias, regardless of actual intent.

<p><b>VI. FINDING DURABLE SOLUTIONS FOR IDPs IN 
PROTRACTED SITUATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>72. Perhaps half of Sri Lanka&#8217;s IDPs were displaced before the CFA. These IDPs are 
predominantly in the North Central and Northern Provinces. A large number were displaced by 
the forced evictions of northern Muslims by the LTTE in 1990. They are mainly in Puttalam and 
Mannar; another 57,000 remain in Jaffna unable to return to land within the HSZ. Others, in 
Vavuniya, came from the hill country and were originally landless; still others are displaced from 
or within the Vanni. Though the circumstances of their displacement vary, these IDPs share a 
common reality: the process for finding a durable solution has stalled, and they continue to have 
specific protection and assistance needs related to their displacement. As a result, they show 
greater social and economic marginalization from their communities of displacement and a 
greater dependence upon humanitarian assistance. 
</p>
<p>73. The Representative was encouraged by the authorities&#8217; recognition that finding durable 
solutions for these IDPs must become a priority. As the IDPs&#8217; needs and intentions vary, so too 
will appropriate responses. Thus two important projects thus far (the World Bank housing 
project in Puttalam, and UNHCR&#8217;s relocation villages in Vavuniya) take different approaches, 
one assisting those who have taken a step toward local integration by acquiring land rights and 
the other assisting the landless. To adequately address the situation of protracted displacement in 
Sri Lanka, however, efforts must be undertaken on a different scale, requiring the collaboration 
of diverse actors, including national and local government, humanitarian and development 
communities, bilateral donors and international financial institutions.  
</p>
<p>74. UNHCR has undertaken surveys in a number of districts, in welfare centres and among 
host families, to gather information on IDPs&#8217; preferred solutions and the obstacles they face in 
achieving them. With comprehensive information, application of the Framework for Durable 
Solutions could provide a common point of departure to develop a coordinated response.  
</p>
<p>75. In the face of the conflict, return will not presently be possible for everyone who would 
elect it. This is the situation of many of the Puttalam IDPs. The Representative met a group of 
northern Muslim IDPs in Puttalam who expressed great frustration that a welfare centre survey 
concluded that 96 per cent of residents wished to integrate locally. In this regard, it must be 
recognized that local integration and return are not mutually exclusive. To the contrary, those 
living marginalized lives in displacement often do not have either the means or energy to rebuild 
their lives upon return. Pending achievement of a durable solution, all IDPs have the right to a 
life in safety and dignity at their site of displacement. Local integration can be an interim 
solution, allowing IDPs to live the most normal lives possible. Moreover, local integration does 
not negate the right to return, nor does it terminate rights to restitution or compensation.  
</p>
<p>76. While the World Bank project could facilitate local integration as both an interim and a 
durable solution, there was substantial confusion regarding the effect that participation in the 
project would have on IDPs&#8217; voting and property. A clear declaration of IDPs rights is needed to 
reassure the IDPs and to allow them to begin planning both their intermediate and ultimate 
solutions. </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/6/Add.4

</p>
<p><b>VII. PREVENTING FUTURE DISPLACEMENT AND 
MITIGATING ITS CONSEQUENCES 
</b></p>
<p>77. The Government has clearly stated its intention to continue military activities and disarm 
the LTTE. Accordingly the Common Humanitarian Action Plan (CHAP) assumes substantial 
additional displacement in 2008.  
</p>
<p>78. In their efforts to prevent displacement, the Representative reminds all parties to the 
conflict of the imperatives of international humanitarian law. The campaign in the East saw 
repeated allegations on both sides that civilians were targeted, used as human shields, or 
prevented from fleeing hostilities. Likewise, there were allegations of deliberate co-location of 
military installations near civilian populations and indiscriminate shelling. While he did not look 
into these allegations, actions of this kind would violate the principles of distinction and 
proportionality and the duty to take precautionary measures. Remembering the civilians who 
were trapped for a period in Vaharai, the Representative reminds the parties of their duty to 
facilitate rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief. Similarly, the duty to exercise 
constant care to spare the civilian population requires that the parties ensure safe passage to IDPs 
seeking safety elsewhere.  
</p>
<p>79. Important lessons applicable to future situations may be drawn from the experience of 
mass displacement and mass return in the East. First, in conflict, security forces often will be the 
first to receive fleeing IDPs, before humanitarian actors can arrive. It is therefore essential that 
the security forces have in place a plan that focuses on addressing the immediate needs of this 
civilian population. While the need to address security may be a component of the plan, it should 
be humanitarian and civilian in nature. In particular, IDPs&#8217; freedom of movement must be 
respected, and IDPs may not be confined to a camp. Contingencies should include identification 
of possible sites for emergency accommodation, stockpiling of emergency shelter items, and 
planning for the immediate provision of food, water, sanitation and essential medical assistance 
upon arrival. As quickly as possible, however, there should be a prompt transition from military 
involvement to civilian control of the humanitarian response. In particular, planning and 
management of IDP camps should be done by civilian authorities. 
</p>
<p>80. Second, authorities have positive obligations to facilitate conditions for IDPs to make a 
voluntarily, informed and meaningful choice among the three durable solutions. Return often is 
the preferable and preferred solution for IDPs. With 220,000 displaced in the East, government 
announcements evidenced a strong desire to see the displaced quickly returned home; officials 
may have sought to pre-empt a situation of protracted displacement. But the speed and 
magnitude of return prompted concerns about voluntariness and sustainability. The need for 
greater consultation, participation and information sharing in the return process is discussed 
above. Conditions necessary for voluntary choice further include eliminating any aspect of 
coercion, whether using a military presence in camps during returns, the announcements of 
deadlines, or threats to close camps and discontinue assistance. Similarly, IDPs must not be 
directed prematurely or unwillingly to relocation. Where return is their preferred solution, this 
must be facilitated by all reasonable means.  
</p>
<p>81. Conditions to support sustainability such as security, shelter, livelihoods and basic services 
are addressed above. It is essential that these issues be addressed in parallel with return, and not 
only in development plans to be implemented following return. Thus, questions remain about the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/6/Add.4 
  page 23 
 
</p>
<p>long-term viability of sustainable return in the East. IDPs in return communities and transit 
centres expressed a desire and intent to return; but when asked whether they preferred to be 
where they were or back at the site of displacement, the answers were mixed. Some communities 
seemed poised on the edge of flight, should a serious security incident occur. In the longer term, 
the lack of livelihoods and utter reliance on humanitarian assistance threaten the sustainability of 
this mass return.  
</p>
<p><b>VIII.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>Sri Lanka&#8217;s displacement crisis is a challenge because of its size and the range of 
circumstances in which IDPs live, their immediate needs, and the challenges they face 
finding durable solutions. The Representative acknowledges the substantial achievements 
of the Government but believes that significant further efforts are required. He reiterates 
his desire to continue his dialogue with the Government, and specifically, to cooperate in 
the search for durable and equitable solutions for all of Sri Lanka&#8217;s IDPs. In this spirit, he 
makes the following conclusions and recommendations.</b>  
</p>
<p>83. <b>Concerning the national response, the Representative recommends that the 
Government:</b> 
</p>
<p> <b>(a) Develop a comprehensive policy addressing all aspects of internal displacement, 
in line with the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. This policy should assign 
institutional responsibilities and establish accountability and should address issues 
including standards for registration and deregistration, entitlements to assistance and 
equitable standards for compensation for loss of property and livelihoods. It should also 
enshrine the principle of voluntariness of return in safety and dignity and the right of IDPs 
to informed choice;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Allocate sufficient resources and increase its own capacity to protect and 
assist IDPs; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Ensure consistent and accessible dissemination of information to IDPs 
concerning their rights and entitlements, and procedures for accessing them; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Establish mechanisms to ensure that IDPs are consulted and participate in 
decisions affecting their lives; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Undertake contingency planning for increased displacement in the North, in 
particular that both military and civilian authorities be prepared to receive IDPs in 
conditions of safety and dignity;</b> 
</p>
<p> <b>(f) Support international and national humanitarian actors in their efforts through 
advance communication and consultation and facilitated access to all IDP and returnee 
populations for assistance, protection and early recovery activities alike. </b></p>

</p>
<p>84. <b>With regard to the 300,000 displaced since 2006 who have returned home or remain 
in displacement, the Representative recommends that the Government:</b>  
</p>
<p> <b>(a) Address all sources of insecurity and threats to safety, including abductions and 
disappearances, the presence of armed elements in camps and transit sites, the presence of 
UXO in return areas, heavy-handed responses by security forces, and the use of additional 
identification to restrict returnees&#8217; freedom of movement; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Restore security through increased civilian police presence, including local and 
Tamil-speaking police, and promptly restore civilian administration; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Take effective measures to address impunity; 
 (d) Assure, at all times, the right to adequate shelter; 
 (e) Recall, with regard to housing and property, that participation in needs-based 
assistance schemes does not negate rights to restitution or compensation; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Ensure that access to livelihoods and basic services is provided in parallel with 
return.</b> 
</p>
<p>85. <b>Concerning the 300,000 IDPs in protracted displacement, the Representative:</b> 
</p>
<p> <b>(a) Urges national authorities and international agencies to identify and address 
obstacles to the achievement of durable solutions, including special attention to issues of 
landlessness and livelihoods and the needs of the most vulnerable, including widows and 
female-headed households; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Calls upon all relevant actors to improve the standard of living and protection 
of individuals pending the achievement of durable solutions.</b> 
</p>
<p>86. <b>The Representative recommends that the United Nations, humanitarian and 
development organizations and donors:</b>  
</p>
<p> <b>(a) Continue to support the Government of Sri Lanka in meeting its primary 
responsibility to protect and assist IDPs;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Continue to support capacity-building within the Government; 
 (c) Address gaps that fall between traditional humanitarian and development 
assistance but that are necessary to establish the conditions for durable solutions, including 
efforts supporting early recovery and confidence-building and stabilization measures, with 
attention to protracted situations;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Prioritize support for livelihoods initiatives for IDPs, host and return 
communities.</b>  </p>
