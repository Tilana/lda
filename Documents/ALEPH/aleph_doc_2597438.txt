for the sharing of costs and outputs and do not in themselves generate revenue and profit. The joint operations
are of the type where initially one party contributes tenements with the other party earning a specified
percentage by funding exploration activities; thereafter the parties often share exploration and development
costs and output in proportion to their ownership of joint operation assets.
There are no other associates or joint venture entities.

Directors’ Report
OPERATING OVERVIEW
Slver Lake is an all»Australian, ASX listed gold producing and exploration company operating in the
Eastern Goldfields district of Western Australia. Slver Lake’s land position in Western Australia covers
highly prospective, under explored tenements containing gold, silver and copper.
Group Financial Overview
In FY2016 Slver Lake achieved its gold sales guidance and delivered on its strategy of refocusing its human
and investment capital on the Miunt Manger Operation to develop lower cost ore sources and deploy a
significant exploration program focused on shareholder return.
Measures implemented at Miunt Mmger to deliver consistent cash generative ounces, together with the
restructuring of the cost base to match the mine profile, proved successful and generated FY2016 gold
sales of 132,400 ounces (FY2015: 124,209 ounces).
Lower priority, non-core exploration projects at the Murchison and Great Qiuthern were leased, divested
or joint ventured to third parties, allowing Silver lake to focus on high value exploration and development
in the highly endowed Nbunt Manger gold camp,
The Group recorded a net profit after tax for the period of $4,413,000 (2015: loss of $94, 024, 000) and
generated operating cash flow of $54, 992,000 (2015: $32, 696,000).
A reconciliation between the statutory profit after tax and the Group's underlying operating results is
tabled on page 11. This reconciliation is an unaudited non-IFRS measure that, in the opinion of the Board,
provides useful information to assess the operating performance of the Group. As noted in the table, the
Group's EBlTDA (before significant items) was $56, 749, 000 for the period (2015: $38, 004, 000),
The increase in EBlTDA (excluding significant items) compared with the previous corresponding period is
primarily due to:

I an 8% increase in gold production from the M)unt Manger Operation (131,109 ounces recovered
compared with 121,780 ounces in FY2015) primarily due to an increase in open pit production
following commencement of the Lucky Bay and Santa Area open pit mines in FY2016 which
together contributed 54,907 ounces of gold in the period. Production from these mines replaced
lower grade stockpiles milled in FY2015, resulting in a 6% increase in recovered head grade (3.5
g/t compared with 3,3 g/ t);

I a 6%increase in the average realised gold price (A$1,580/ oz compared with A$1,497/ oz);

I a 4% decrease in the all in sustaining cost (A$1,281/ oz compared with A$1,331/oz). This was
primarily as a result of introduction of ore from the Lucky Bay and Santa Area open pits replacing
lower grade stockpiled ore in the mill feed.

Gold sold for the year totalled 132,400 oz compared with 124,209 oz recorded in FY2015 (previous period
included 2,209 02 recovered from the Murchison Operation which was placed on care and maintenance in
in FY2015),

Overview of Operations

Mount Manger

A number of new ore sources were introduced at Miunt Manger in FY2016 including the Lucky Bay and
Santa open pits, with mining activities also occurring at the Daisy Complex and Cock-eyed Bob (CEB)
underground mines. Stockpiles from the Salt Creek mine were also processed during the period, primarily
7 P a g e

///‘
Directors’ Report
in the first half of the financial year. All processing occurred at the centralised Randalls Gold Processing
Facility, which has capacity of approximately 12 million tonnes per annum.
In FY2016 approximately $15 million was invested in a gated and phased exploration program which
yielded significant results across all stages of the exploration pipeline, from early stage target delineation
through to advanced resource definition drilling Exploration highlights included a substantial resource
increase at Maxwells, resource extensions at CEB, high»grade Dinnie Reng intersections, strong gold
trends identified from air-core drilling of structural targets to the north and west of Daisy, spectacular
high»grade gold intersections and extensions to the Daisy Complex gold lodes, and very encouraging high»
grade gold intersections from underground positions at Daisy Complex targeting gold veining north of the
North Fault,
Mining and production statistics for the IVbunt Minger Operation for the year ended 30 June 2016 are
detailed in Table 1 and Table 2.
Murchison Operation
In October 2015, the Company terminated its dry hire lease arrangement with a private consortium for the
Muchison processing facility. A total of $1,494,000 of lease income was received from the lessee since the
commencement of the lease in January 2015, which fully covered associated care and maintenance costs
over the same period of $250,000.
As at 30 June 2016, lease income of $6, 087,000 remains unpaid and due to the uncertainty in recovering
this balance, a provision for doubtful debt for the entire amount has been recorded (of which $2,929,000
was recorded during FY2016), The processing facility has been placed on care and maintenance and a
process to crystalise value from this asset is underway,
Divestment of non»core assets
On 25 November 2015, the Company announced that it had entered into two transactions in respect of its
non-core tenure in the Murchison area of Western Australia, These transactions are consistent with Slver
lake's stated objective of delivering embedded value from its non»core assets, Further detail in respect of
the transactions is provided below:
Comet
The Comet tenements (and associated infrastructure) were sold to a wholly owned subsidiary of
Matals X Limited for a cash consideration of $3,000,000, resulting in a gain on disposal of $2,930, 000,
Settlement of this transaction occurred on 4 February 2016.
Cue Project Farm-In andjoint Venture
Silver Lake entered into a Farm»in and Joint Venture Agreement with Mrsgrave Minerals Limited
(ASX:IVEV) under which IVEV may earn up to an 80% joint venture interest in tenements comprising the
beagee Gold and Hollandaire Copper Projects (’Qre Project’), In December 2015 all conditions precedent
relating to the transaction were satisfied, with IVBV issuing Silver lake with $75,000 in ordinary shares.
Furthermore, IVEV must now spend a minimum of $900,000 on exploration on the Cue Project tenure over
the next 12 months,
The Murchison processing facility and associated core tenements do not form part of either transaction
and have been retained by the Company,

Directors’ Report

Great Southern Project

In December 2015 Slver Lake entered into a conditional Farm-in and Joint Venture Agreement with ACH

Minerals Pty Ltd ("ACH") in respect of the Company’s Great Southern Project (“Project”)l The agreement

substantially covers Silver Lake’s tenure in the Great Southern, as well as all mining information, the

Ravensthorpe Camp lease and freehold properties held by the Company in the regp'on.

Under the agreement, ACH may earn a 51%j oint venture interest in the Project by spending a minimum of

$3 million on exploration within three years from the Agreement becoming unconditional ("Stage 1").

Upon earning a 51%joint venture interest, ACH may elect to increase its joint venture interest in the

Project to 80%by spending a further $3 million within a further three year period ("Stage 2"). As part of

the agreement Slver lake also granted ACH an option to acquire the Project on an outright basis at any

time during the Stage 1 or Stage 2 earn in periods, for a cash consideration of $5 million in excess of any
expenditure incurred to that point

In July 2016 the Company was formally notified by ACH that it had exercised its option to purchase the

Project for a cash consideration of $5 million Completion of the sale of the Project and receipt of the

consideration is expected to occur in 01 FY2017.

Exploration
Drring the year a total of $15 million was spent on exploration primarily on, or in close proximity to the
Daisy Complex, Cock»eyed Bob and Maxwells areas The exploration was focused on highly prospective,
near-term gold targets at Mrunt Mrnger, proximal to existing mine and processing infrastructure
Mrunt Manger is a highly endowed gold field with a large portfolio of exploration targets, which requires
that exploration expenditure be deployed efficiently and effectively. Accordingly, all exploration targets
at Mrunt Mrnger are assessed and ranked according to their technical strengths, potential economic
return, the probability that the target will become a production source and the priority given to the
exploration target having regard to the Company’s operating strategy
The success of this program in FY2016 has warranted approval of a $14 million exploration budget for
PY2017r Of this budget, 50% will be directed to resource definition to sustain current operations and is
concentrated at Daisy Complex, Cock»eyed Bob and Maxwells. The remaining 50% will be directed to
multiple growth exploration targets in the Mruirt Belches BIF units, Salt Creek area and structural corridor
to the north and west of the Daisy Complex.
STRATEGY
The Group’s short to medium term strategy is to maximise cash flow and increase operating margins from
its core Mrunt Mrnger Operation This will be achieved by:

I relentless drive to reduce costs and increase productivity;

I introduction of new, lower cost ore sources into the production schedule, including the
Imperial/ Majestic open pits and the Maxwells underground in FY2017;

I executing the exploration strategy by directing expenditure to highly prospective priority
targets in the Mrunt Manger area; and

I continue to crystalise value from non-core assets

Key risks in being able to deliver on the Group’s strategy include:

I price and demand for gold - It is diffith to accurately predict future demand and gold price
movements and such movements may adversely impact on the Group‘s profit margins, future
development and planned future production;

I exchange rates 7 The Group is exposed to the Australian dollar currency risk on gold sales,
which are denominated in US dollars Therefore, revenue will be affected by movements in
the US dollar gold price or movement in the Australian Dollar exchange rate (against the US
dollar);

I Reserves and Resources - 'lhe Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves for the Group's assets are
estimates only and no assurance can be given that they will be realised;

I operations » The Group’s gold mining operations are subject to operating risks that could
result in decreased production, increased costs and reduced revenues Operational difficulties
may impact the amount of gold produced, delay deliveries or increase the cost of mining for
varying lengths of time; and

I exploration success 7 No assurance can be given that exploration expenditure will result in
future profitable operating mines

1!. Fixed remuneration
Fixed remuneration is set at a level that is aligned to market benchmarks and reﬂective of Executives’
skills, experience, responsibilities and performance.
When positioning base pay, the Company presently aims to position aggregate fixed remuneration at the
50th percentile of the industry benchmarking report. This is to ensure that the Company's remuneration
arrangements remain competitive against peer companies to assist with the retention and attraction of
key talent.
Executive remuneration is benchmarked annually to ASK-listed companies of similar size (by market
capitalisation), revenue base, employee numbers and complexity. Specific reference is also made to peer
companies within the mining and exploration sectors.
c. Emit-term incentive (Sl‘l) arrangements
The purpose of the SH plan is to link the achievement of key Company targets with the remuneration
received by those Executives charged with meeting those targets.
The STI plan provides eligible employees with the opportunity to earn a cash bonus if certain financial
hurdles and agreed key performance indicators (KPk) are achieved. The Board has determined that the
Company must be cash-flow positive, from normal operating and sustaining capital activities (excluding
enhancement activities) for the applicable performance period, for any STI to be paid.
All Executives are eligible to participate in the STI plan with awards capped at 100% of the target
opportunity.
Each year the Nomination & Remuneration Committee, in conjunction with the Board, sets KPI targets for
Executives. Ordinarily, the KPIs would include measures relating to the Group and the individual, and
include financial, production, people, safety and risk measures.

AUDITOR’ S INDEPB‘IDENCE

Section 307C of the Corporations Act 2001 requires Slver lake’s auditors, KPIVE, to provide the Directors
of Slver Lake with an Independence Declaration in relation to the audit of the financial report for the
year ended 30 June 2016, This Independence Declaration is attached to the Directors’ Report and forms a
part of the Directors' Report.

NON-AUDIT SERVICES

hiring the year KPMS, the Group's auditor, has performed certain other services in addition to the audit
and review of the financial statements.

The Board is satisfied that the provision of non»audit services is compatible with, and did not compromise
the general standard of independence for auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001 for the following
reasons:

I all non»audit services were subject to the corporate governance procedures adopted by the Group
and have been reviewed by the Audit Committee to ensure they do not impact the integrity and
objectivity of the auditor, and

I the non»audit services provided do not undermine the general principles relating to auditor
independence as set out in APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, as they do not
involve reviewing or auditing the auditor’s own work, acting in a management or decision making
capacity for the Group, acting as an advocate for the Group or jointly sharing risk and rewards

Details of the amounts paid to the auditor of the Group, KPIVE, and its network firms for audit and non»
audit services provided during the year are set out below:

ROUNDING OFF

The Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Corporations Instrument 2016/ 191 dated 1 April 2016 and in

Report on the financial report 
We  have  audited  the  accompanying  financial  report  of  Silver  Lake  Resources  Limited  (the 
company), which comprises the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, 
and  consolidated  statement  of  profit  or  loss  and  other  comprehensive  income,  consolidated 
statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended on that 
date, notes 1 to 36 comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory 
information and the directors’ declaration of the Group comprising the company and the entities 
it controlled at the year’s end or from time to time during the financial year. 
Directors’ responsibility for the financial report  
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives 
a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations 
Act  2001  and  for  such  internal  control  as  the  directors  determine  is  necessary  to  enable  the 
preparation of the financial report that is free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or 
error.  In  note  1,  the  directors  also  state,  in  accordance  with  Australian  Accounting  Standard 
AASB 101  Presentation  of  Financial  Statements,  that  the  financial  statements  of  the  Group 
comply with International Financial Reporting Standards.
Auditor’s responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. These Auditing Standards require that 
we comply with relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform 
the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  whether  the  financial  report  is  free  from  material 
misstatement.  
An  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain  audit  evidence  about  the  amounts  and 
disclosures in the financial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due 
to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant 
to the entity’s preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing 
an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating 
the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial report.  
We performed the procedures to assess whether in all material respects the financial report presents 
fairly, in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 and Australian Accounting Standards, a true 
and fair view which is consistent with our understanding of the Group’s financial position and of 
its performance.  
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our audit opinion.

The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended 30 June 2016 comprise
the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as "the Group” and individually as "Group Entities”).
The consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 23 August 2016.
The financial report is a general purpose financial report which:

a has been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards ("AASBs") (including
Australian Accounting interpretations) adopted by the Australian Accounting Standards Board
("AASB") and the Corporations Act 2001;

o complies with International Financial Reporting Standards ("[FRSs") and interpretations adopted by
the International Accounting Standards Board ("lASB” );

a has been presented on the historical cost basis except for the following items in the statement of
financial position:

0 investments which have been measured at fair value.

0 equity settled share based payment arrangements have been measured at fair value.

0 inventories which have been measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

0 exploration, evaluation and development assets which have been measured at recoverable

value where impairments have been recognised.

There have been no material changes to accounting policies for the periods presented in these consolidated
financial statements. Sgnificant accounting policies specific to one note are included in that note.
Accounting policies determined non»significant are not included in the financial statements.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented and by all Group entities.
Certain comparative disclosures have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.
(a) Functional and Presentation Currency
These consolidated financial statements are prepared in Australian dollars, which is the functional currency
of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Corporations Instrument
2016/ 191 dated 1 April 2016 and in accordance with that Corporations Instrument, all financial information
has been rounded off to the nearest thousand dollars, unless otherwise stated.
(b) Use of Judgements and Estimates

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

For the year ended 30 June 2016

(c) Basis for Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group. A list of controlled
entities (subsidiaries) at year end is disclosed in Note 30

The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company,
using consistent accounting policies

lntra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra»group
transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements

(d) Determination of Fair Value
A number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value for both
financial and non»financial assets and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement and] or
disclosure purposes based on the following methods When applicable, further information about the
assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability.

When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as
possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in
the valuation techniques as follows:

a level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

a level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,

either directly (ie as prices) or indirectly (irer derived from prices)

0 level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.

If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value
hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value
hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. The Group recognises
transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the
change has occurred.

(e) Impairment of Non-Financial Assets

The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories, exploration and evaluation
expenditure and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any
indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated.

The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value
less costs to sell In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present
value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks
specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are
grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are
largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the "cash»generating unit”).
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash»generating unit exceeds its
recoverable amountr hnpairment losses are recognised in the profit and loss Impairment losses recognised in
respect of cash»generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill and then to
reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a prorata basis.

Impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the
loss has decreased or no longer exists An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a Change in the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 30 June 2016
estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that
the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of
depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised An impairment loss in respect of
goodwill is not reversed.
Long term development and production phase assets that relate to unmined resources are assessed in light of
current economic conditions Assumptions on the economic returns on and timing of specific production
options may impact on the timing of development of these assets, The carrying values of these assets are
assessed at balance date using a fair value less cost to sell technique This is done based on implied market
values against their existing resource and reserve base and an assessment on the likelihood of recoverability
from the successful development or sale of the asset, The implied market values are calculated based on
recent comparable transactions within Australia converted to a value per ounce, This is considered to be a
Level 3 valuation technique
2. Segment Reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn
revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the
Group's other components. The Group does not have any operating segments with discrete financial
information. The Group does not have any customers, other than the Perth Mnt and its bankers, and all the
group assets and liabilities are located within Western Australia. The Board of Directors review internal
management reports on a monthly basis that are consistent with the information provided in the Statement
of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income, Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Cash
Flows. As a result, no reconciliation is required because the information as presented is used by the Board to
make strategic decisions.

Included in current year gold sales is 103, 986 ounces of gold sold (at an average price of A$1,566/ ounce)
under various hedge programs. At 30 June 2016, the Company has a total of 76,327 ounces of gold left to be
delivered under these programs.
Accounting Policies
Gold Sales
Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risk and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer,
recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated
reliably and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Gold forward contracts
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as gold forward contracts to manage the risks associated
with commodity price. The sale of gold under such hedge instruments is accounted for using the ’own use
exemption’ under AASB 139 Financial Instruments and as such all hedge revenue is recognised in the Profit
and loss and no fair value adjustments are subsequently made to sales yet to be delivered under the hedging
program.

Accounting Policies
Mning and processing costs
This includes all costs related to mining, milling and site administration, net of costs capitalised to mine
development and production stripping. This category also includes movements in the cost of inventory and
any net realisable value write downs.
Amortisation
The Group applies the units of production method for amortisation of its mine properties, which results in an
amortisation charge proportional to the depletion of the anticipated remaining life of mine production.
These calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions in relation to reserves and resources,
metallurgy and the complexity of future capital development requirements. These estimates and assumptions
are reviewed annually and changes to these estimates and assumptions may impact the amortisation charge
in the profit and loss and asset carrying values.
The Group uses ounces mined over mineahle inventory as its basis for depletion of mine properties. In the
absence of reserves, the Group believes this is the best measure as evidenced by historical conversion of
resources to reserves. The Group applies applicable factoring rates when adopting the units of production
method to reflect the risk of conversion from the inferred and indicated categories to mineahle inventory.
Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated on either a reducing balance basis or on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful life of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Leased assets are depreciated over the
shorter of the lease term and their useful life while processing plants are depreciated on the life of the mine
basis. Capital work in progress is not depreciated until it is ready for use. Depreciation methods, useful lives
and residual values are reassessed at each reporting date. The estimated useful lives for the current and
comparative period are as follows:

Interest income comprises bank interest on funds invested and is recognised as it accrues, using the effective
interest method. Finance expenses comprise interest expense on borrowings and unwinding of the discount
on provisions. All borrowing costs are recognised in profit and loss using the effective interest method in the
period in which they are incurred except borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition,
construction and production of a qualifying asset that necessarily takes a substantial period to get ready for
its intended use or sale. In this case, borrowing costs are capitalised as part of the qualifying assetr

Accounting Policies
Income Tax
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in profit or loss
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in
equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation
purposes. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary
differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
reporting date.
Tax Consolidation
The Company and its wholly-owned entities are part of a tax-consolidated group. As a consequence, all
members of the tax-consolidated group are taxed as a single entity (Silver lake Resources limited is the head
entity within the tax-consolidation group).
Current tax expense/ benefit, deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets arising from temporary
differences of the members of the tax-consolidated group are recognised in the separate financial statements
of the members of the tax»consolidated group using the ’separate taxpayer within the group’ approach by
reference to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the separate financial statements of each entity
and the tax values applying under tax consolidation.
Any current tax liabilities (or assets) and deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses of the subsidiaries
are assumed by the head entity in the tax-consolidated group and are recognised by the Company as amounts
payable/ (receivable) to/ (from) other entities in the tax»consolidated group. Any differences between these
amounts are recognised by the Company as an equity contribution or distribution.
The Company recognises deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses of the tax»consolidated group to
the extent that it is probable that the future taxable profits of the tax»consolidated group will be available
against which the asset can be utilised.
Any subsequent period adjustments to deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses as a result of revised
assessments of the probability of recoverability is recognised by the head entity only.
Tax losses
At 30 June 2016 the Company has $321,763,000 (2015: $282,286, 000 loss) of tax losses that are available for
offset against future taxable profits of the Company. The Group has not recorded these carry forward tax
losses that equate to an unrecognised deferred tax asset at 30]une 2016 of $96, 529,000 (2015: $84, 686,000).
The potential benefit of carried forward tax losses will only be obtained if taxable profits are derived of a
nature and, of an amount sufficient to enable the benefit from the deductions to be realised or the benefit
can be utilised by the Group provided that:
i) the provisions of deductibility imposed by law are complied with; and
ii) no change in tax legislation adversely affects the realisation of the benefit from the deductions.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 30 June 2016
In accordance with the Group's accounting policies for deferred taxes, a deferred tax asset is recognised for
unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable profits will be available to utilise those losses.
Determination of future taxable profits requires estimates and assumptions as to future events and
circumstances, in particular, whether successful development and commercial exploitation, or alternatively
sale, of the respective areas of interest will be achieved. This includes estimates and judgments about
commodity prices, ore resources, exchange rates, future capital requirements, future operational
performance and the timing of estimated cash flows. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could
impact on the amount and probability of estimated taxable profits and accordingly the recoverability of
deferred tax assets.

Basic EPS is calculated as profit/ loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company divided by the
weighted average number of ordinary shares.
Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary
shares, including share options granted to employees.

Accounting Policies
Inventory
Inventories of ore, gold in circuit, gold bullion and work in progress are physically measured or estimated and
valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost comprises direct materials, labour and transportation expenditure in bringing such inventories to
their existing location and condition, together with an appropriate portion of fixed and variable overhead
expenditure based on weighted cost incurred during the period in which such inventories were produced.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated cost of
completion and the estimated cost necessary to perform the sale. Inventories of consumable supplies and
spare parts that are expected to be used in production are valued at cost Obsolete or damaged inventories
of such items are valued at net realisable valuei
Consumables and spare parts are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable Valuer Any provision for
obsolescence is determined by reference to specific stock items identified.
Bullion on Hand
Bullion on hand comprises gold that has been delivered to the Perth Mint prior to period end but which has
not yet been delivered into a sale contract.

For the year ended 30 June 2016

and evaluation of mineral resources, including all expenditure incurred prior to securing legal rights to

explore an area, is expensed as incurred.

Fxploration and evaluation expenditure incurred is accumulated in respect of each identifiable area of

interest. An 'area of interest’ is an individual geolom'cal area which is considered to constitute a favourable

environment for the presence of a mineral deposit or has been proved to contain such a deposit. These costs
are carried forward only if they relate to an area of interest for which rights of tenure are current and in
respect of which:

0 such costs are expected to be recouped through successful development and exploitation or from sale
of the area; and

o exploration and evaluation activities in the area have not, at balance date, reached a stage which
permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable resources,
and active and significant operations in, or relating to, this area are continuing.

A regular review is undertaken of each area of interest to determine the appropriateness of continuing to

carry forward costs in relation to the area of interest. If costs do not meet the criteria noted above, they are

written off in full against the profit and loss statement.

Fxploration and evaluation assets are transferred to Development Phase assets once technical feasibility and

commercial viability of an area of interest is demonstrable. Exploration and evaluation assets are tested for

impairment, and any impairment loss is recognised, prior to being reclassified.

Impairment testing of exploration and evaluation assets

Fxploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment if sufficient data exists to determine technical

feasibility and commercial viability or facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount exceeds the

recoverable amount.

Fxploration and evaluation assets are tested for impairment when any of the following facts and

circumstances exist:

. the term of exploration license in the specific area of interest has expired during the reporting period
or will expire in the near future, and is not expected to be renewed;

. substantive expenditure on further exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific
area are not budgeted or planned;

. exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area have not led to the discovery of
commercially viable quantities of mineral resource and the decision was made to discontinue such
activities in the specific area; or

a sufficient data exists to indicate that, although a development in the specific area of interest is likely
to proceed, the carrying amount of the exploration and evaluation asset is unlikely to be recovered in
full from successful development or by sale.

When a potential impairment is indicated, an assessment is performed for each CGU which is no larger than

the area of interest.

Exploration expenditure commitments

Fxploration expenditure commitments represent tenement rentals and minimum spend requirements that are

required to be met under the relevant legislation should the Group wish to retain tenure on all its current

tenements.

Mine Properties and Mining Assets
Mne properties represents the acquisition cost and] or accumulated exploration, evaluation and development
expenditure in respect of areas of interest in which mining has commenced.
Mne development costs are deferred until commercial production commences. When commercial production
is achieved mine development is transferred to mine properties, at which time it is amortised on a unit of
production basis based on ounces mined over the total estimated resources related to this area of interest.
ﬁgnificant factors considered in determining the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the project
are the completion of a feasibility study, the existence of sufficient resources to proceed with development
and approval by the board of Directors to proceed with development of the project.
Underground development expenditure incurred in respect of a mine development after the commencement
of production is carried forward as part of mine development only when substantial future economic benefits
are expected. Otherwise, this expenditure is expensed as incurred.
Reserves and Resources
Resources are estimates of the amount of gold product that can be economically extracted from the Group’s
mine properties. In order to calculate resources, estimates and assumptions are required about a range of
geolom'cal, technical and economic factors, including quantities, grades, production techniques, recovery
rates, production costs, future capital requirements, short and long term commodity prices and exchange
rates.
Estimating the quantity and/ or grade of resources requires the size, shape and depth of ore bodies to be
determined by analysing geological data. This process may require complex and difficult geological
judgments and calculations to interpret the data.
The Group determines and reports ore resources under the Australian Code of Reporting for Mneral Resource
and Ore Reserves (2004 and 2012), known as the JORC Code. The JORC Code requires the use of reasonable
assumptions to calculate resources. Due to the fact that economic assumptions used to estimate resources
change from period to period, and geolom'cal data is generated during the course of operations, estimates of
resources may change from period to period. Changes in reported resources may affect the Group's financial
results and financial position in a number of ways, including:
o asset carrying values may be impacted due to changes in estimates of future cash flows;
. amortisation charged in the profit and loss statement may change where such charges are calculated
using the units of production basis;
- decommissioning, site restoration and environmental provisions may change due to Changes in
estimated resources after expectations about the timing or costs of these activities change; and
. recognition of deferred tax assets, including tax losses.
Deferred Stripping Costs
Stripping is the process of removing overburden and waste materials from surface mining operations to access
the ore. Stripping costs are capitalised during the development of a mine and are subsequently amortised
over the life of mine on a units of production basis, where the unit of account is tonnes of ore milledr

Items of plant and equipment are stated at their cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment
losses.
Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self»
constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to
bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use, and the costs of dismantling and removing
the items and restoring the site on which they are located.
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted
for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment. The cost of replacing part of
an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable
that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group and its cost can be
measured reliably. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised

In July 2016 the Company was formally notified by ACH Minerals Pty Ltd that it had exercised its option to
purchase the Great Southern project (Project) for cash consideration of $5,000,000 as per the Farm»in and
Joint Venture Agreement. Completion of the sale of the Project and receipt of the consideration is
expected to occur during 01 FY2017,
As a result of this, the net carrying value of the Project at 30 June 2016 was reduced to $5, 000,000,
resulting in a $2,825,000 impairment recorded in the profit and loss statement, The net carrying value
comprises $10,056,000 of assets and $5,056,000 of liabilities,
Accounting Policies
Nonrcurrent assets and associated liabilities are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount will
be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than continuing use and a sale is highly
probable. Assets designated as held for sale are held at the lower of carrying amount at designation and
fair value less costs to sell.

At 30 June 2016, the Group has performed a test for impairment indicators and reversal in accordance
with AASB 136 and determined that no factors existed which would require an impairment test, The
impairment of exploration assets in 2016 relates to a specific sale transaction (refer Note 17).
Impairments in relation to 30 June 2015 were as follows:
Mount Monger CGU
In FY2015 a number of factors represented indicators of impairment, including a reduction in the gold
price outlook, the Company’s market capitalisation relative to its book value at the time and a reduction
in the lVbunt Minger CGU resource base. As a result, the Company assessed the recoverable amount of the
ant Mmger (EU in 2015. There were no indicators of impairment as at 30 June 2016 and therefore no
impairment assessment was required in the current year.
Commentary on the FY2015 impairment review is provided below:

- The key assumptions in addition to the life of mine plans used in the discounted cash flow
valuation were the gold price, the Australian dollar exchange rate against the US dollar and the
discount rate;

0 Gold price and AU!) USD exchange rate assumptions were estimated by management, with
reference to external market forecasts, For the review, the forecast gold price was estimated at
US$1,1837US$1,250/ oz and the forecast exchange rate of US$0.74 to US$0, 78 per A$1.00, based on
a forward curve over the life of the mines,

o A discount rate of 11%was applied to the post tax cash ﬂows expressed in nominal terms. The
discount rate was derived from the Group's post tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC),
with appropriate adjustments made to reﬂect the risks specific to the CGUr
o The impairment testing carried out at 30 June 2015 resulted in a total impairment charge to the
Profit or loss Statement of $32,445, 000
Long term development and mine assets
As a result of changes to operating and capital cost assumptions, long term development assets were
impaired by $22,391,000 in FY2015.
Exploration assets
At 30]une 2015, the recoverable amount of certain assets was assessed as lower than the carrying amount
which resulted in an impairment charge of $32,158,000 on exploration and evaluation assets. This was due
to the reduction in the gold price outlook at the time and an assessment of future exploration spend on
the respective areas of interest

Trade payables are recognised at the value of the invoice received from a supplier. They represent
liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial year that are
unpaid and arise when the Group becomes obliged to make future payments in respect of the purchase of
these goods and services. The amounts are unsecured and generally paid between 3045 days of
recognition.

On 29 December 2014 the Company entered into a secured Gold Prepay Facility ("Facility") with the
Commonwealth Bank of Australia ("CBA"), raising $10,000,000. Under the Facility, Silver lake was
contracted to deliver a total of 7,056 ounces of gold to CBA betweenJanuary 2015 and June 2016 (392
ounces per month) As at 30 June 2016, the Facility has been repaid in full.
The Group’s exposure to interest rate and liquidity risk arising from these interest bearing liabilities is
disclosed in Note 27.
Accounting Policies
All borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly
attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interestrbearing borrowings are subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Fees paid on the establishment of loan
facilities that are yield related are included as part of the carrying amount of the borrowings.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer
settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date.

(ii) Other LongeTerm Employee Benefits
The Group’s net obligation in respect of longeterrn employee benefits is the amount of future benefit that
employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods plus related on costs.
The benefit is discounted to determine its present value using a discount rate that equals the yield at the
reporting date on Australian corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the
Group's obligations.
(iii) ShorteTerm Benefits
Liabilities for employee benefits for wages, salaries, annual leave and sick leave represent present
obligations resulting from employees’ services provided to reporting date and are calculated at
undiscounted amounts based on remuneration wage and salary rates that the Group expects to pay as at
reporting date including related onecosts.
22. Share based payments
Employee options (equity-settled)
On 14 October 2013 the Group granted Mr Duke Tonkin, (at the time Executive [ﬁrector of Operations), a
total of 2,000,000 employee options as part of his employment agreement which were approved by
shareholders at the 2013 AGM The total expense recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss for these
options for the period ended 30June 2016 was $150,275 (2015: $253,087)

Accounting Policies
SharerBased Payment Transactions
The grantrdate fair value of equityrsettled share based payment awards granted to employees is generally
recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting period of the awards.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reﬂect the number of awards for which the related
service and nonrmarket performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately
recognised is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance
conditions at the vesting date. For share based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant»
date fair value of the sharerbased payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true»up
for differences between expected and actual outcomes.

(2015: $5,936,000)
Accounting Policies
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Company has a present legal or constructive
obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outﬂow of economic benefits will be
required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the
expected future cash ﬂows at a discount rate that reﬂects current market assessments of the time value
of money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Closure and Rehabilitation
The mining, extraction and processing activities of the Group normally give rise to obligations for site
closure or rehabilitation. The extent of work required and the associated costs are dependent on the
requirements of relevant authorities and the Group's environmental policies.
Provisions for the cost of each closure and rehabilitation program are recognised when the Group has a
present obligation and it is probable that rehabilitation] restoration costs will be incurred at a future date,
which generally arises at the time that environmental disturbance occurs. When the extent of disturbance
increases over the life of an operation, the provision is increased accordingly.
Costs included in the provision encompass all closure and rehabilitation activity expected to occur
progressively over the life of the operation and at the time of closure, in connection with disturbances, as
at the reporting date.
The timing of the actual closure and rehabilitation expenditure is dependent upon a number of factors
such as the life and nature of the asset, the operating licence conditions and the environment in which
the mine operates. Expenditure may occur before and after closure and can continue for an extended
period of time dependent on closure and rehabilitation requirements

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 30 June 2016
Closure and rehabilitation provisions are measured at the expected value of future cash ﬂows, discounted
to their present value. Significant judgements and estimates are involved in forming expectations of
future activities and the amount and timing of the associated cash flows.
When provisions for closure and rehabilitation are initially recognised, to the extent that it is probable
that future economic benefits associated with the rehabilitation, decommissioning and restoration
expenditure will ﬂow in the entity, the corresponding cost is capitalised as an asset. The capitalised cost
of closure and rehabilitation activities is recognised in exploration evaluation and mine properties and is
amortised accordingly. The value of the provision is progressively increased over time as the effect of
discounting unwinds, creating an expense recognised in finance expenses.
Closure and rehabilitation provisions are also adjusted for changes in estimates. Those adjustments are
accounted for as a change in the corresponding capitalised cost, except where a reduction in the provision
is greater than the unamortised capitalised cost of the related assets, where it is probable that future
economic benefits will flow to the entity, in which case the capitalised cost is reduced to nil and the
remaining adjustment is recognised in the profit and loss.
Adjustments to the estimated amount and timing of future closure and rehabilitation cash ﬂows are a
normal occurrence in light of the significant judgements and estimates involved. Factors inﬂuencing those
changes include:
o revisions to estimated reserves, resources and lives of operations;
0 regulatory requirements and environmental management strategies;
0 changes in the estimated costs of anticipated activities, including the effects of inflation and
movements in foreign exchange rates;
. movements in interest rates affecting the discount rate applied; and
. the timing of cash ﬂows.
At each reporting date the rehabilitation and restoration provision is remeasured to reﬂect any of these
changes.

27. Financial risk management
(a) Overview
This note presents information about the Group's exposure to credit, liquidity and market risks, the
objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the management of capital.
The Board regularly reviews the use of derivatives and opportunities for their use within the Group.
Exposure limits are reviewed by management on a continuous basis. The Group does not enter into or
trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the risk management
framework. Management monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group
through regular reviews of the risks.
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument
fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from
customers.
Presently, the Group undertakes gold mining, exploration and evaluation activities exclusively in Australia.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
i) Cash and cash equivalents
The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing in liquid securities and only with major
Australian financial institutions.
ii) Trade and other receivables
The Group’s trade and other receivables relate to gold sales, G51" refunds and rental income.
At 30 June 2016, a provision for doubtful debts of $6, 723,000 has been recorded against rental
income receivable as a result of a debtor being place in liquidation. This receivable is therefore not
reﬂected in the trade and other receivables balance in Note 27(c).

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 30 June 2016
The Group has determined that its credit risk exposure on all other trade receivables is low, as
customers are considered to be reliable and have short contractual payment terms Management
does not expect any of these counterparties to fail to meet their obligations
(c) Exposure to credit risk
The carrying amount of the Group's financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure The Group’s
maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was:
Carrying Amount
2016 2015
M
Trade and other receivables 2,317 4,966
Cash and cash equivalents 38,643 22,538
Total 40,960 27,504
(d) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have
sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without
incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation. The Group manages liquidity
risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves from funds generated from operations and by continuously
monitoring forecast and actual cash flows,
To mitigate large ﬂuctuations in the USD:AUD exchange rate as well as the USD denominated gold price,
the Company has entered into hedm'ng programmes whereby future bullion sales are hedged at a
predetermined AUD gold price, At 30 June 2016, the Company has a total of 76,327 ounces to be delivered
under these hedges over the next 12 months at an average of A$1,655/ oz. The sale of gold under these
hedges is accounted for using the ’own use exemption’ underAAﬂS 139 Financial Instruments and as such
all hedge revenue is recognised in the Profit and Loss and no mark to market valuation is performed on
undelivered ounces

(e) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and
equity prices will affect the Group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments The
objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable
parameters, whilst optimising the return The Group only has exposure to interest rate risk and equity
price riski
(f) Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk (primarily on its cash and cash equivalents and its interest
bearing liabilities), which is the risk that a financial instrument’s value will fluctuate as a result of
changes in the market interest rates on interest-bearing financial instruments. The Group does not use
derivatives to mitigate these exposures.
i) Profile
At the reporting date the interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial
instruments was:
Carrying Amount
2016 2015
M
Fixed rate instruments
Financial liabilities
Stamp duty liability (6,062) (9, 615)
Gold prepay facility - (6; 757)
Total (6, 062) (16,382)
Variable rate instruments
Financial assets
Cash and cash equivalents 38, 643 22, 538
ii) Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments
The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through
profit or loss Therefore, a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect profit or
loss.

iii) Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments
A change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have
increased/ (decreased) equity and profit or loss after tax by $386,000 (2015: $225,000). This
analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.
(9) Equity price risk
Equity investments are long»term investments that have been classified as financial assets at fair value
through profit or loss. The Group is exposed to insignificant equity price risk arising from its equity
investments.
(h) Fair values
The carrying amounts of financial assets are valued at year end at their quoted market price.
(i) Capital management
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market
confidence and to sustain future development of the business through future exploration and development
of its proj ects. There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the year.
Risk management policies and procedures are established with regular monitoring and reporting.
28. Commitments
The Group has $2,488,000 of capital commitments in the next financial year relating to the acquisition of
property plant and equipment (2015: nil) and $4,670,000 (2015: $7,174,000) of commitments relating to
minimum exploration expenditure on its various tenements.

Accounting Policies
joint Operation Arrangements
The Group has investments in joint operations but they are not separate legal entities. They are
contractual arrangements between participants for the sharing of costs and outputs and do not in
themselves generate revenue and profit. The joint operations are of the type where initially one party
contributes tenements with the other party earning a specified percentage by funding exploration
activities; thereafter the parties often share exploration and development costs and output in proportion
to their owneiship of joint operation assets. The joint operations do not hold any assets and accordingly
the Group's share of exploration evaluation and development expenditure is accounted for in accordance
with the policy set out in Note 14.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 30 June 2016
ii. AASBl5 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
In Nhy 2014, the IASB issued [FRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which replaced IAS 11
Construction Contracts, IAS 18 Revenue and related interpretations. The AASB issued the Australian
equivalent of [FRS 15, being AASB 15, in December 2014. Currently, these standards are effective for
annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2017. Early application is permitted however
the IASB and the AASB have proposed a one year deferral to [FRS 15/AASB 15, which if approved, would
move the effective date to annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 July 2018i The core
principle of [FRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers is that an entity recognises
revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reﬂects the
consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services An entity
recognises revenue in accordance with that core principle by applying the following steps:

a) identify the contract(s) with a customer

b) identify the performance obligations in the contract

c) determine the transaction price

d) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract

e) recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation

This new standard is not expected to have an impact on the Group’s Financial Statements.
iii. AASB 2014»3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards 7 Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests
inJoint Operations: applicable to annual reporting periods begn'nning on or after 1July 2016i
AASB 2014»3 amends AASB 11 joint Arrangements to provide guidance on the accounting for acquisitions
of interests in joint operations in which the activity constitutes a business The amendments require:

0 the acquirer of an interest in a joint operation in which the activity constitutes a business, as
defined in AASB 3 Business Combinations, to apply all of the principles on business combinations
accounting in AASB 3 and other Australian Accounting Standards except for those principles that
conﬂict with the guidance in AASB 11]oint Arrangements; and;

o the acquirer to disclose the information required by AASB 3 and other Australian Accounting
Standards for business combinations

Adoption of this amendment will not result in a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.
iv. AASB 2014»4 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation: applicable to

annual reporting periods betﬁnning on or after 1 July 2016.

AASB 116 Property Plant and Equipment and AASB 13B Intangible Assets both establish the principle

for the basis of depreciation and amortisation as being the expected pattern of consumption of the future
economic benefits of an asset The IASB has clarified that the use of revenue»based methods to
calculate the depreciation of an asset is not appropriate because revenue generated by an activity that
includes the use of an asset generally reﬂects factors other than the consumption of the economic
benefits embodied in the asset. The amendment also clarified that revenue is generally presumed to be
an inappropriate basis for measuring the consumption of the economic benefits embodied in an
intangible asset.

Qirrently the Group does not have a revenue»based policy to calculate the depreciation of an asset and
adoption of this standard is therefore not expected to impact the financial statements of the Company.
