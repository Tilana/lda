<p><b>Human Rights Council 
</b>Eighteenth session 
<b>Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent 
</b>Tenth session 
Geneva, 28 March &#8211; 1 April 2011 
Item 8 of the provisional agenda 
<b>Thematic discussion on the situation of peoples of African descent 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Note by the Secretariat</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p>1. The World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and 
Related Intolerance, held in Durban, South Africa, from 31 August to 8 September 2001, 
adopted the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action containing recommendations 
intended to strengthen the international human rights framework to combat racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</p>
<p>2. The Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent was established by the 
Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 2002/68. The Commission, in its resolution 
2003/30, reformulated paragraph 8 (<i>d</i>) of resolution 2002/68 and expanded the mandate of 
the Working Group. In its resolution 9/14, the Human Rights Council decided to extend the 
mandate of the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent for a further three 
years. The mandate is as follows: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To study the problems of racial discrimination faced by people of African 
descent living in the diaspora and, to that end, gather all relevant information from 
Governments, non-governmental organizations and other relevant sources, including 
through the holding of public meetings with them; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To propose measures to ensure full and effective access to the justice system 
by people of African descent; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To submit recommendations on the design, implementation and enforcement 
of effective measures to eliminate racial profiling of people of African descent; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To make proposals on the elimination of racial discrimination against 
Africans and people of African descent in all parts of the world; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To address all the issues concerning the well-being of Africans and people of 
African descent contained in the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action; 
</p>
<p>  
 * Late submission.

<p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/AC.3/2 
</b></p>
<p><b>2</b> 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) To elaborate short-, medium- and long-term proposals for the elimination of 
racial discrimination against people of African descent, bearing in mind the need for close 
collaboration with international and development institutions and the specialized agencies 
of the United Nations system to promote the human rights of people of African descent 
through, inter alia, the following activities: 
</p>
<p>(i) Improving the human rights situation of people of African descent by 
devoting special attention to their needs through, inter alia, the preparation of 
specific programmes of action; 
</p>
<p>(ii) Designing special projects, in collaboration with people of African descent, 
to support their initiatives at the community level and to facilitate the 
exchange of information and technical know-how between these populations 
and experts in these areas; 
</p>
<p>(iii) Liaising with financial and developmental institutional and operational 
programmes and specialized agencies of the United Nations, with a view to 
contribute to the development programmes intended for people of African 
descent by allocating additional investments to health systems, education, 
housing, electricity, drinking water and environmental control measures and 
promoting equal opportunities in employment, as well as other affirmative or 
positive measures and strategies within the human rights framework. 
</p>
<p>3. At its first and second sessions, the Working Group decided to recommend that 
specific themes relevant to the situation of people of African descent be addressed at its 
forthcoming sessions (E/CN.4/2003/21). The Working Group considered that this approach 
would allow invited panellists on the selected themes to inform the discussions and enrich 
the debates at the sessions, and lead to the formulation of measures and recommendations 
addressed to the Commission. The Working Group followed this methodology at its third, 
fourth, fifth and sixth sessions. At its seventh session, although following a similar 
methodology, the Working Group analysed the observations and conclusions adopted at its 
previous sessions in order to distil and formulate its contribution to the Preparatory 
Committee of the Durban Review Conference. At its eighth session, the Working Group 
reviewed the work accomplished in previous sessions and methodologies employed and 
analysed the situation of children of African descent. At its ninth session, the Working 
Group examined the theme of structural discrimination as it affects people of African 
descent, as well as possible activities to mark the International Year for People of African 
Descent (2011). 
</p>
<p>4. In its resolution 64/169, the General Assembly proclaimed 2011 to be the  </p>
<p>International Year for People of African Descent. The aim of the Year is to strengthen 
national actions and regional and international cooperation for the benefit of people of 
African descent in relation to their full enjoyment of economic, cultural, social, civil and 
political rights, their participation and integration in all political, economic, social and 
cultural aspects of society, and to promote greater knowledge of and respect for their 
diverse heritage and culture. The General Assembly encouraged, inter alia, the specialized 
agencies of the United Nations system, within their respective mandates and existing 
resources, to make preparations for and identify possible initiatives that could contribute to 
the success of the Year. In accordance with the resolution, the Working Group, at its tenth 
session, will seek to contextualise the Year through a discussion of, and the drafting of 
conclusions and recommendations on, the  situation currently faced by people of African 
descent; positive action to combat discrimination against people of African descent; the 
contribution made by people of African descent to global development; and the lack of 
knowledge of the culture, history and traditions of people of African descent. </p>

<p>5. The discussion on the situation currently faced by people of African descent will 
have a special focus on the right to food and on poverty rates. The World Food Summit and 
Millennium Development Goals call for cutting hunger and extreme poverty, two related 
concepts, by half by 2015. Many Afro-descendant communities still suffer from 
malnutrition and food insecurity not because of lack of food, but of poverty. Over the next 
five years, there will be a need for measures to reduce poverty and eradicate hunger 
affecting people of African descent. 
</p>
<p>6. Positive action is recognized as a key element in the international struggle against 
racism and racial discrimination in the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and 
in the Outcome Document of the Durban Review Conference. Furthermore, the concept of 
positive measures is accepted by the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination, and was further examined by the Committee on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination in its general recommendation 32. The aim of 
positive measures it to create conditions for all to participate effectively in decision-making 
and to realize civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights in all spheres of life on the 
basis of non-discrimination. In areas such as employment, housing, education, culture and 
participation in public life, however, people of African descent often face discriminatory 
treatment. Positive action policies have been implemented in various countries, particularly 
with regard to employment in the public sector and education, and have shown to be an 
effective and often necessary tool to reach de facto equality in those areas for people of 
African descent.  
</p>
<p>7. The contribution made by people of African descent to global development often 
goes unrecognized. Scientists and economists of African descend, such as Philip 
Emeagwali, who contributed to the invention of the Internet, Lewis Latimer, who helped 
develop the electric light bulb, and Sir William Arthur Lewis, who developed important 
theories on economic development, have contributed greatly to social progress and global 
development, but their names often remain widely unknown. 
</p>
<p>8. The history of people of African descent goes back through the Atlantic slave trade 
and migration to the African continent. The population of people of African origin, living 
all over the world, though predominantly in North and Latin America and the Caribbean, is 
very ethnically mixed. Africans of the diaspora have brought and preserved traditions from 
the African continent and have generated unique and dynamic cultures. African 
descendants have contributed to the cultural development in their countries in areas such as 
language, music, literature and the visual arts. Owing to years of segregation and racial 
discrimination, however, the traditions and culture of people of African descent have often 
developed separately and remain today little known by a large part of the population and 
unreflected in many educational curricula.  
</p>
<p>9.  The Working Group will discuss the above phenomena and draft conclusions and 
recommendations that seek to address the ongoing challenges faced by people of African 
descent.
