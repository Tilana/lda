<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>

</p>
<p>Human Rights and other applicable human rights instruments, 
</p>

</p>
<p>Assembly and the Human Rights Council on the situation of human rights in Belarus, 
</p>
<p>including Council resolution 26/25 of 27 June 2014, and deploring the inadequate response 
</p>
<p>and lack of cooperation by the Government of Belarus to the requests of the Council made 
</p>
<p>in those resolutions, including the denial of access to the Special Rapporteur on the 
</p>
<p>situation of human rights in Belarus and other special procedures mandate holders to the 
</p>

</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1 and 5/2 of 18 June 2007,

</p>
<p>rights in Belarus;1 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Expresses deep concern</i> at the continuing violations of human rights in 
</p>
<p>Belarus, which are of a systemic and systematic nature, as well as at the use of torture and 
</p>
<p>ill-treatment in custody, the lack of response by the Government of Belarus to cases of 
</p>
<p>enforced disappearance of political opponents, the impunity of perpetrators of human rights 
</p>
<p>violations, the violations of labour rights amounting to forced labour, the significant gaps in 
</p>

<p>anti-discrimination legislation, the pressure on defence lawyers, and the lack of 
</p>
<p>participation of opposition political parties in Parliament; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Calls upon</i> the Government of Belarus to carry out a comprehensive review 
</p>
<p>of relevant legislation, policies, strategies and practices to ensure that the provisions are 
</p>
<p>clearly defined, consistent with international human rights law and with its human rights 
</p>
<p>obligations and commitments, and not used to impede or unduly restrict the exercise of any 
</p>
<p>human right, including the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the right to peaceful 
</p>
<p>assembly and the right to freedom of association, including to form and join a trade union,

</p>
<p>penalty to expedite its work; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Urges</i> the Government of Belarus to carry out a comprehensive reform of the

</p>
<p>right to an effective review of sentences and convictions by a higher tribunal established by 
</p>

</p>
<p>Government to continue recent attempts to reform the judiciary; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Strongly urges</i> the Government of Belarus to immediately and release 
</p>
<p>unconditionally and rehabilitate fully all political prisoners, to ensure that those who have 
</p>
<p>been released are immediately and fully reinstated in their civil and political rights, in

</p>
<p>comprehensive, transparent and credible investigations, reports of torture and ill-treatment 
</p>
<p>by law-enforcement officials and to prosecute alleged perpetrators and punish those found 
</p>
<p>guilty, and to put an immediate end to the arbitrary arrest, detention and harassment of 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders, political opponents and journalists, to arbitrary travel bans and to 
</p>
<p>other policies aimed at intimidating representatives of the political opposition and the 
</p>
<p>media, as well as human rights defenders and civil society organizations; 
</p>

</p>
<p>the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur and the Office for Democratic 
</p>
<p>Institutions and Human Rights of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe 
</p>
<p>in this regard, and urges Belarus to ensure that the presidential elections are free, fair, 
</p>
<p>inclusive and peaceful while providing for equal treatment of all candidates before, during 
</p>
<p>and after the vote, and to issue an early invitation to the Office for Democratic Institutions 
</p>
<p>and Human Rights for it to conduct a potential election observation mission based on a 
</p>
<p>timely needs-assessment mission; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Strongly encourages</i> the Government of Belarus to establish a national 
</p>
<p>human rights institution in accordance with the principles relating to the status of national
