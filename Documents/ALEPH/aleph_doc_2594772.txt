PURSUANT TO SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002
I, Brian A. Staebler, certify that:
1.     I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Everflow Eastern Partners, L.P.;
2.     Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the
period covered by this quarterly report;
3.     Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included
in this quarterly report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this quarterly
report;
4.     The registrant’s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(c) and 15d-15(e))
and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f)) for the registrant and we have:
a)     designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and
procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to
the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those
entities, particularly during the period in which this quarterly report is being prepared;
b)     designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over
financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;
c)     evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls and presented in this
quarterly report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and
procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, based on such
evaluation; and
d)     disclosed in this quarterly report any change in the registrant’s internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during the registrant’s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant’s fourth
fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting; and
Exhibit 31.2
5.     The registrant’s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent
evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant’s auditors and the audit
committee of registrant’s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent function):
a)     all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant’s ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information; and
b)     any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting.
