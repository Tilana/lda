<p> 
</p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the relevant articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
</p>
<p>and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which protect the right 
</p>

</p>
<p>torture and the right to recognition as a person before the law, 
</p>

</p>
<p>Human Rights establishing a Working Group consisting of five members, to serve as 
</p>
<p>experts in their individual capacity, to examine questions relevant to enforced or 
</p>
<p>involuntary disappearances,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also</i> General Assembly resolution 47/133 of 18 December 1992, by

</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging</i> the adoption of the International Convention for the Protection 
</p>
<p>of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance by the General Assembly in its 
</p>
<p>resolution 61/177 of 20 December 2006, and recognizing that its entry into force as 
</p>
<p>soon as possible through its ratification by 20 States will be a significant event, 
</p>

</p>
<p>disappearances in various regions of the world, including arrest, detention and 
</p>
<p>abduction, when these are part of or amount to enforced disappearances, and by the 
</p>
<p>growing number of reports concerning harassment, ill-treatment and intimidation of 
</p>
<p>witnesses of disappearances or relatives of persons who have disappeared, 
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging</i> the fact that acts of enforced disappearance are crimes against 
</p>
<p>humanity, as defined in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court,<b> </b></p>

<p>or Involuntary Disappearances (A/HRC/7/2) and of the recommendations contained 
</p>
<p>therein;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Decides</i> to extend the mandate of the Working Group for a further 
</p>
<p>period of three years, and encourages it, in fulfilling its mandate:  
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To promote communication between families of disappeared persons 
</p>
<p>and the Governments concerned, particularly when ordinary channels have failed, 
</p>
<p>with a view to ensuring that sufficiently documented and clearly identified individual 
</p>
<p>cases are investigated and to ascertain whether such information falls under its 
</p>
<p>mandate and contains the required elements; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To observe, in its humanitarian task, United Nations standards and 
</p>
<p>practices regarding the handling of communications and the consideration of 
</p>
<p>Government replies;

</p>
<p>promotion of human rights through action to combat impunity

<p> (<i>e</i>) To pay particular attention to cases transmitted to it that are most 
</p>
<p>urgent from a humanitarian perspective and that refer to ill-treatment, serious 
</p>
<p>threatening or intimidation of witnesses of enforced or involuntary disappearances or 
</p>
<p>relatives of disappeared persons; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) To pay particular attention to cases of disappearance of persons 
</p>

</p>
<p>disappearances and improving the protection of such persons; 
</p>

<p> 3. <i>Calls on</i> Governments that have not provided for a long period of time 
</p>
<p>substantive replies concerning claims of enforced disappearances in their countries to 
</p>
<p>do so and to give due consideration to relevant recommendations concerning this 
</p>
<p>issue made by the Working Group in their reports; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Urges</i> States:

</p>
<p>All Persons from Enforced Disappearances; </p>

<p> (<i>b</i>) To cooperate with the Working Group and help it to carry out its 
</p>
<p>mandate effectively and, in that framework, give serious consideration to requests for 
</p>
<p>visits to their countries; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To prevent the occurrence of enforced disappearances, including by 
</p>

</p>
<p>authorities and institutions whose competence in this regard has been recognized by 
</p>
<p>the concerned State, maintaining official, accessible, up-to-date registers and/or 
</p>
<p>records of detainees, and ensuring that detainees are brought before a judicial 
</p>
<p>authority promptly after detention; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To work to eradicate the culture of impunity for the perpetrators of 
</p>
<p>enforced disappearances and to elucidate cases of enforced disappearances as crucial 
</p>
<p>steps in effective prevention; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To prevent and investigate with special attention cases of enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearance of persons belonging to vulnerable groups, especially children, and to 
</p>
<p>bring the perpetrators of these enforced disappearances to justice; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) To take steps to provide adequate protection to witnesses of enforced 
</p>
<p>or involuntary disappearances, human rights defenders acting against enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearances and the lawyers and families of disappeared persons against any 
</p>
<p>intimidation or ill-treatment to which they might be subjected; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Urges</i> the Governments concerned: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To intensify their cooperation with the Working Group on any action 
</p>
<p>taken pursuant to recommendations addressed to them by the Working Group; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To continue their efforts to elucidate the fate of disappeared persons 
</p>
<p>and to ensure that competent authorities in charge of investigation and prosecution are 
</p>
<p>provided with adequate means and resources to resolve cases and bring perpetrators to 
</p>
<p>justice; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To make provisions in their legal systems for victims of enforced or 
</p>
<p>involuntary disappearances or their families to seek fair, prompt and adequate </p>

<p>reparation and, in addition, where appropriate, to consider symbolic measures 
</p>
<p>recognizing the suffering of victims and restoring their dignity and reputation; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To address the specific needs of the families of disappeared persons; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Reminds</i> States that: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) As proclaimed in article 2 of the Declaration on the Protection of All 
</p>
<p>Persons from Enforced Disappearances, no State shall practise, permit or tolerate 
</p>
<p>enforced disappearances; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) All acts of enforced or involuntary disappearance are crimes 
</p>
<p>punishable by appropriate penalties, which should take due account of their extreme 
</p>
<p>seriousness under criminal law; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) They should ensure that their competent authorities proceed 
</p>
<p>immediately to conduct impartial inquiries in all circumstances where there is reason 
</p>
<p>to believe that an enforced disappearance has occurred in territory under their 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) If there is reason to believe that an enforced disappearance has 
</p>
<p>occurred in territory under their jurisdiction, all the perpetrators of that disappearance 
</p>
<p>must be brought to justice; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) Impunity is simultaneously one of the underlying causes of enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearances and a major obstacle to the elucidation of such cases; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) As proclaimed in article 11 of the Declaration, all persons deprived of 
</p>
<p>liberty must be released in a manner permitting reliable verification that they have 
</p>
<p>actually been released and, further, have been released in conditions in which their 
</p>
<p>physical integrity and ability fully to exercise their rights are assured;  
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Expresses</i>: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Its thanks to the many Governments that have cooperated with the 
</p>
<p>Working Group and replied to its requests for information and to the Governments 
</p>
<p>that have accepted visits of the Working Group to their countries, requesting them to 
</p>
<p>give all necessary attention to the Working Group&#8217;s recommendations and inviting </p>

<p>them to inform the Working Group of any action they take on those 
</p>
<p>recommendations; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Its appreciation to the Governments that are investigating, cooperating 
</p>
<p>at the international and bilateral levels, and have developed or are developing 
</p>
<p>appropriate mechanisms to investigate any claims of enforced disappearance that are 
</p>
<p>brought to their attention, and encourages all Governments concerned to expand their 
</p>
<p>efforts in this area; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Invites</i> States to take legislative, administrative, legal and other steps, 
</p>
<p>including when a state of emergency has been declared, at the national and regional 
</p>
<p>levels and in cooperation with the United Nations, if appropriate through technical 
</p>
<p>assistance, and to provide the Working Group with concrete information on the 
</p>
<p>measures taken and the obstacles encountered in preventing enforced and involuntary 
</p>
<p>disappearances and in giving effect to the principles set forth in the Declaration; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Takes note</i> of the assistance provided to the Working Group by 
</p>
<p>non-governmental organizations and their activities in support of the implementation 
</p>
<p>of the Declaration, and invites those organizations to continue their cooperation; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to continue: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To ensure that the Working Group receives all the assistance and 
</p>
<p>resources it requires to perform its functions, including supporting the principles of 
</p>
<p>the Declaration, carrying out and following up on missions and holding sessions in 
</p>
<p>countries that are prepared to receive it; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To provide the resources needed to update the database on cases of 
</p>
<p>enforced disappearance; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To keep the Working Group and the Council regularly informed of the

<p>steps taken for the wide dissemination and promotion of the Declaration; 
</p>

</p>
<p>programme of work.

<p>            </p>

<p>                                                                                                      <i>40th meeting
