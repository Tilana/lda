SPINDLETOP OIL & GAS CO. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ORGANIZATION
The accompanying financial statements are presented in accordance with the requirements of
Form 10-Q and consequently do not include all of the disclosures normally required by generally
accepted accounting principles or those normally made in the Company's annual Form 10-K filing.
Accordingly, the reader of this Form 10-Q may wish to refer to the Company's Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2012 for further information.
The consolidated financial statements presented herein include the accounts of Spindletop Oil &
Gas Co., a Texas corporation ("the Company") and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Prairie Pipeline
Co., a Texas corporation and Spindletop Drilling Company, a Texas corporation. All significant
inter-company transactions and accounts have been eliminated.
In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim financial statements contain all
material adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly
the financial condition, the results of operations and changes in cash flows of the Company and its
consolidated subsidiaries for the interim periods presented. Although the Company believes that
the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading, certain information
and footnote disclosures, including a description of significant accounting policies normally
included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, have been condensed or omitted
pursuant to such rules and regulations.
Subsequent Events
The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the issuance date of this report of August
14, 2013.
Item 2. - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations
WARNING CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes
thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.
This Report on Form 10-Q may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
federal securities laws, principally, but not only, under the caption “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” We caution investors that any forward-
looking statements in this report, or which management may make orally or in writing from time to
time, are based on management’s beliefs and on assumptions made by, and information currently
available to, management. When used, the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,”
“might,” “plan,” “estimate,” “project,” “should,” “will,” “result” and similar expressions which do not
relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These
statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions and are not guarantees of future
performance, which may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties, and
factors, that are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize,
or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those
anticipated, estimated, or projected. We caution you that while forward-looking statements reflect
our good faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future performance and are
impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such
-8-
statements. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update our forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, investors should
use caution in relying on past forward-looking statements, which are based on results and trends at
the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends.
Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or
achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements
include, among others, the factors listed and described at Item 1A “Risk Factors” in the Company’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K, which investors should review. There have been no changes from
the risk factors previously described in the Company’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2012 (the “Form 10-K”).
The current global economic and financial crisis could lead to an extended national or global
economic recession. A slowdown in economic activity caused by a recession would likely reduce
national and worldwide demand for oil and natural gas and result in lower commodity prices for
long periods of time. Prices for oil and natural gas are volatile. Costs of exploration, development
and production have not yet adjusted to current economic conditions. Prolonged, substantial
decreases in oil and natural gas prices would likely have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, could further limit the
Company's access to liquidity and credit and could hinder its ability to satisfy its capital
requirements.
Capital and credit markets experienced unprecedented volatility and disruption over the last few
years and continue to be unpredictable. Given the current levels of market volatility and disruption,
the availability of funds from those markets has diminished substantially. Further, arising from
concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of borrowers
specifically, the cost of accessing the credit markets has increased as many lenders have raised
interest rates, enacted tighter lending standards or altogether ceased to provide funding to
borrowers.
Due to these capital and credit market conditions, Spindletop cannot be certain that funding will be
available to the Company in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company. The Company is
evaluating whether current cash balances and cash flow from operations alone would be sufficient
to provide working capital to fully fund the Company's operations. Accordingly, the Company is
evaluating alternatives, such as joint ventures with third parties, or sales of interest in one or more
of its properties. Such transactions if undertaken could result in a reduction in the Company's
operating interests or require the Company to relinquish the right to operate the property. There can
be no assurance that any such transactions can be completed or that such transactions will satisfy
the Company's operating capital requirements. If the Company is not successful in obtaining
sufficient funding or completing an alternative transaction on a timely basis on terms acceptable to
the Company, Spindletop would be required to curtail its expenditures or restructure its operations,
and the Company would be unable to continue its exploration, drilling, and recompletion program,
any of which would have a material adverse effect on Spindletop's business, financial condition
and results of operations.
The Obama administration has set forth budget proposals which if passed, would significantly
curtail our ability to attract investors and raise capital. Proposed changes in the Federal income tax
laws which would eliminate or reduce the percentage depletion deduction and the deduction for
intangible drilling and development costs for small independent producers, will significantly reduce
the investment capital available to those in the industry as well as our Company. Lengthening the
time to expense seismic costs will also have an adverse effect on our ability to explore and find
new reserves.
Other sections of this report may also include suggested factors that could adversely affect our
business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly
changing environment. New risks may emerge from time to time and it is not possible for
management to predict all such matters; nor can we assess the impact of all such matters on our
business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to
differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these uncertainties,
-9-
investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual
results. Investors should also refer to our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for future periods and
current reports on Form 8-K as we file them with the SEC, and to other materials we may furnish to
the public from time to time through Forms 8-K or otherwise.
Results of Operations
Six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to six months ended June 30, 2012
Oil and gas revenues for the first six months of 2013 were $5,673,000, as compared to $3,973,000
for the same period in 2012, an increase of approximately $1,700,000 or 42.8%.
Natural gas revenues for the first six months of 2013 were $1,502,000 compared to $1,318,000 for
the same period in 2012, an increase of approximately $184,000, or 14.0%. Natural gas sales
volumes for the first six months of 2013 were approximately 374,000 mcf compared to
approximately 373,000 mcf during the first six months of 2012, an increase of approximately 1,000
mcf or 0.3%.
Average natural gas prices received were $4.02 per mcf in the first six months of 2013 as compared
to $3.97 per mcf in the same time period in 2012, an increase of approximately $0.05 per mcf or
1.26%.
Oil sales for the first six months of 2013 were approximately $4,171,000 compared to approximately
$2,655,000 for the first six months of 2012, an increase of approximately $1,516,000 or 57.10%. Oil
sales volumes for the first six months of 2013 were approximately 40,300 bbls, compared to
approximately 25,000 bbls during the same period in 2012, an increase of approximately 15,300
bbls, or 61.2%.
Average oil prices received were $103.46 per bbl in the first half of 2013 compared to $103.97 per
bbl in the first half of 2012, a decrease of approximately $0.51 per bbl or 0.49%.
Revenue from lease operations was $187,000 in the first six months of 2013 compared to $186,000
in the first six months of 2012, an increase of $1,000 or 0.54%.
Revenue from gas gathering, compression and equipment rental for the first six months of 2013
was $63,000 compared to $73,000 for the same period in 2012, a decrease of $10,000 or 13.7%.
Real estate income was approximately $123,000 during the first six months of 2013 compared to
$130,000 for the first six months of 2012, a decrease of approximately $7,000, or 5.38%.
Interest income was $42,000 during the first six months of 2013 as compared to $38,000 during the
same period in 2012, an increase of approximately $4,000 or 10.5%.
Other income for the first six months of 2013 was $43,000 as compared to $896,000 for the same
time period in 2012, a decrease of $853,000 or 95.2%. This change is due to the decrease in cash
received for farm-out agreements in the first six months of 2013 compared to those received in the
first six months of 2012. From time to time, the Company farms out some of its leasehold acreage to
non-affiliated third parties for exploration and development drilling. Generally, the Company
receives a one-time payment for the agreement. The revenues from these farm-out agreements
vary in size and frequency and should not be considered as regularly recurring revenues that the
Company receives.
Lease operations expense in the first six months of 2013 was $1,054,000 as compared to
$1,026,000 in the first six months of 2012, a net increase of approximately $28,000, or 2.7%. This
net increase is due primarily to workover costs between the two periods.
Production taxes, gathering and marketing expenses in the first six months of 2013 were
approximately $504,000 as compared to $365,000 for the first six months of 2012, an increase of
approximately $139,000, or 38.1%. This increase is due primarily to the increased production of
crude oil between the periods.
-10-
Pipeline and rental operations expenses for the first six months of 2013 were $21,000 compared to
$12,000 for the same time period in 2012, an increase of $9,000, or 75.0%. This is due to an
increase in repairs and chemicals needed to maintain the equipment.
Real estate operations expense in the first six months of 2013 was approximately $87,000
compared to $72,000 during the same period in 2012, an increase of approximately $15,000 or
20.8%.
Depreciation, depletion, and amortization for first six months of 2013 was $844,000 as compared to
$671,000 for the same period in 2012, an increase of $173,000, or 25.8%. $808,000 of the amount
for the first six months of 2013 was for amortization of the full cost pool of capitalized costs
compared to $614,000 for the same period of 2012, an increase of $194,000 or 31.6%. The
Company re-evaluated its proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities as of December 31, 2012.
This re-evaluated reserve base was adjusted for the first six months as of June 30, 2013 by
estimating variances in average prices of oil and natural gas that occurred during the period,
adding estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves acquired during the period, and
deducting oil and natural gas reserves that were produced or sold during the period. A depletion
rate of 2.951% for the first quarter of 2013 and a depletion rate of 3.510% for the second quarter of
2013 was calculated and applied to the Company’s full cost pool of capitalized oil and natural gas
properties compared to a total depletion rate of 5.378% for the first six months of 2012.
Asset Retirement Obligation (“ARO”) expense for the first six months of 2013 was approximately
$20,000 as compared to approximately $17,000 for the same time period in 2012, an increase of
approximately $3,000.
General and administrative costs for the first six months of 2013 were approximately $1,536,000 as
compared to approximately $1,594,000 for the same time period of 2012, a decrease of
approximately $58,000 or 3.6%.
Interest expense was approximately $13,000 for the first six months of 2013 compared to
approximately $15,000 for the same period in 2012, a decrease of approximately $2,000 or 13.3%.
This is due to the continued reduction of the principal amount of the loan on the office building
owned by the Company as interest on the note is calculated and paid based on the unpaid balance
of the loan.
Three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to three months ended June 30, 2012
Oil and natural gas revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2013 were $3,528,000,
compared to $2,215,000 for the same time period in 2012, an increase of $1,313,000, or 59.3%.
Natural gas revenues for the second quarter of 2013 were $863,000 compared to $614,000 for the
same period in 2012, an increase of $249,000 or 40.6%. Natural gas volumes sold for the second
quarter of 2013 were approximately 178,000 mcf compared to approximately 216,000 mcf during
the same period of 2012, a decrease of approximately 38,000 mcf, or 17.6%.
Average natural gas prices received were approximately $4.85 per mcf in the second quarter of
2013 as compared to approximately $3.27 per mcf during the same period in 2012, an increase of
approximately $1.58 or 48.3%. This increase in natural gas prices is the primary reason for the
overall increase in natural gas revenues between the periods.
Oil sales for the second quarter of 2013 were approximately $2,665,000 compared to
approximately $1,601,000 for the same period of 2012, an increase of approximately $1,064,000 or
66.46%. Oil volumes recorded for the second quarter of 2013 were approximately 24,700 bbls
compared to approximately 14,600 bbls during the same period of 2012, an increase of 10,100 bbl
or 69.17%. The Company recorded a one-time payment of approximately $725,000 of oil revenue
from non-operated properties during the second quarter of 2012. These revenues covered
production periods through the end of the second quarter 2012. Oil volumes recorded related to this
one-time payment, were approximately 6,700 bbls.
Average oil prices received were approximately $107.89 per bbl in the second quarter of 2013
compared to $104.75 per bbl during the same period of 2012, an increase of approximately $3.14
per bbl, or 3.0%.
Revenue from lease operations for the second quarter of 2013 was approximately $96,000
compared to approximately $105,000 for the second quarter of 2012, a decrease of $9,000 or 8.6%.
-11-
Revenue from gas gathering, compression and equipment rental for the second quarter of 2013
was approximately $35,000, compared to approximately $41,000, a decrease of approximately
$6,000 or 14.6% for the same period in 2012.
Real estate income was approximately $64,000 during the second quarter of 2013 compared to
$62,000 for the same time period of 2012, an increase of approximately $2,000, or 3.2%.
Interest income for the second quarter of 2013 was approximately $24,000 as compared with
approximately $20,000 for the same period in 2012, an increase of approximately $4,000 or 20.0%.
Other income for second quarter of 2013 was approximately $16,000 as compared with
approximately $497,000 for the same period in 2012, a decrease of approximately $481,000. This
change is due to the decrease in cash received for farm-out agreements in the second quarter of
2013 compared to those received in the same period in 2012. From time to time, the Company
farms out some of its leasehold acreage to non-affiliated third parties for exploration and
development drilling. Generally, the Company receives a one-time payment for the agreement. The
revenues from these farm-out agreements vary in size and frequency and should not be considered
as regularly recurring revenues that the Company receives.
Lease operating expenses in the second quarter of 2013 were $609,000 as compared to $647,000
for the same period in 2012, a net decrease of approximately $38,000, or 5.9%. This net decrease
is due primarily to fewer workover costs between the two periods.
Production taxes, gathering, transportation and marketing expenses for the second quarter of 2013
were approximately $337,000 as compared to $200,000 during the second quarter of 2012, a net
increase of approximately $137,000 or 68.5%. This increase is due primarily to the increased
production of crude oil between the periods.
Pipeline and rental operations for the second quarter of 2013 were $13,000 compared to $6,000 for
the same time period in 2012. This is due to an increase in repairs and chemicals needed to
maintain the equipment.
Real estate expenses during the second quarter 2013 were approximately $39,000 compared to
approximately $34,000 for the same period in 2012, an increase of approximately $5,000 or 14.7%.
Depreciation, depletion, and amortization for the second quarter of 2013 was $457,000 as
compared to $380,000 for the same period in 2012, an increase of $77,000, or 20.3%. $438,000 of
the amount for the second quarter of 2013 was for amortization of the full cost pool of capitalized
costs compared to $351,000 for the second quarter of 2012, an increase of $87,000 or 24.8%. The
Company re-evaluated its proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities as of December 31, 2012.
This re-evaluated reserve base was adjusted for the first six months as of June 30, 2013 by
estimating variances in average prices of oil and natural gas that occurred during the period,
adding estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves acquired during the period, and

$10,000 as compared to approximately $9,000 for the same time period in 2012, an increase of
approximately $1,000.
General and administrative costs for the second quarter of 2013 were $768,000 compared to
$772,000 for the same period in 2012, a decrease of approximately $4,000 or 0.5%.

Financial Condition and Liquidity
The Company's operating capital needs, as well as its capital spending program are generally
funded from cash flow generated by operations. Because future cash flow is subject to a number of
variables, such as the level of production and the sales price of oil and natural gas, the Company
can provide no assurance that its operations will provide cash sufficient to maintain current levels
of capital spending. Accordingly, the Company may be required to seek additional financing from
third parties in order to fund its exploration and development programs.
Item 4. - Controls and Procedures
(a) As of the end of the period covered by this report, Spindletop Oil & Gas Co. carried out an
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management,
including the Company's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting
Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and
procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15. Based upon the evaluation, the
Company's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer concluded
that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period
covered by the report.
(b) There have been no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting during
the quarter ended June 30, 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect the Company's internal controls over financial reporting.
