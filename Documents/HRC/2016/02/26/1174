<p><i>Summary 
</i>The Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, 
</p>
<p>conducted an official country visit to the Bahamas from 9 to 11 December 2013. She 
acknowledges the willingness of the Government to combat trafficking in persons, as 
reflected by the ratification of relevant international legal instruments and the enactment of 
domestic legislation in that area, as well as the establishment of a multisectoral mechanism 
to address the issue. She further notes the recent efforts made in prosecuting traffickers. 
</p>
<p>Despite the positive steps taken by the Government, the Special Rapporteur 
observed a number of challenges, including: the absence of a comprehensive assessment of 
the phenomenon at the national level, coupled with low awareness and understanding of 
trafficking in persons among the general population; the absence of a national plan of 
action to effectively combat trafficking in persons; and the restrictive immigration policy, 
which leads to the criminalization and expedited deportations of potential victims. She 
further expresses concern with regard to the limited capacities of frontline officers in 
identifying victims of trafficking, and underlines the weakness of the victims&#8217; assistance 
programme, which is ad hoc rather than institutionalized.

<p> United Nations A/HRC/26/37/Add.<footnote name="5">9. Compensation and restitution are an integral part of effective remedies for victims of 
trafficking. Section 6 of the Trafficking in Persons Act provides that when a defendant is 
found guilty of trafficking, the court shall order the payment of restitution to the victim to 
compensate for: (a) costs of medical and psychological treatment, (b) costs of physical and 
occupational therapy and rehabilitation, (c) costs of necessary transportation, temporary 
housing and childcare, (d) lost income, (e) legal counselling fees, (f) emotional distress and 
(g) any other loss suffered by the victim. The Act also envisages the confiscation and 
forfeiture of assets and proceeds from trafficking offences, which should first be used for 
the payment of restitution. The law does not speak of compensation; however, in the 
absence of an institutionalized compensation scheme it is not clear whether victims would 
systematically be granted any compensation. Moreover, tying restitution to the conviction 
of perpetrators makes it contingent on victims&#8217; cooperation in judicial processes, thus </footnote>

victims and the absence of a national survey to assess the scope and trend of the 
phenomenon in the country. Moreover, trafficking in the Bahamas remains insidious while 
cases of migrant smuggling are regularly reported by the media and authorities. This is 
coupled with little understanding about the conceptual differences between those two 
phenomena. The form of trafficking that has been identified in the Bahamas is for </footnote>

<p><b>  Report of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children, on her mission to the 
Bahamas (9&#8211;<footnote name="1">3. Although the Bahamas acceded to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of 
Refugees and its 1967 Protocol in 1993, the Government has no regulatory framework to 
implement its obligations under the Convention. As such, the Government responds to 
asylum seekers and refugees on an ad hoc basis, providing no access to judicial remedies. 
Moreover, the Bahamas is not a party to the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of 
Stateless Persons or the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. That is 
worrisome, as migrant populations in the Bahamas include a complex mix of economic 
migrants, asylum seekers and refugees, victims of trafficking and other individuals in need 
of international protection, such as undocumented and unaccompanied minors and people 
of undetermined nationality. Moreover, in many cases, children born of undocumented 
Haitian migrants in the Bahamas are reported to reach the age of majority without ever 
being registered or able to receive residency or citizenship in the Bahamas, despite the fact 
that the Constitution of the Bahamas provides that persons of foreign parents born in the 
Bahamas may apply for citizenship when they reach the age of 18. Those children are 
therefore de facto at risk of statelessness, which makes them even more vulnerable to 
exploitation.

of the Trafficking in Persons Act stipulates that the offence of trafficking in persons 
constitutes an extraditable offence and that, in that respect, any State party to the Palermo 
Protocol will be deemed a &#8220;treaty State&#8221; within the meaning of the Act. The Office of the 
Attorney General informed the Special Rapporteur that although there was no formal 
agreement with Jamaica, a good partnership had been established in the investigation and 
prosecution of the current cases. Moreover, the Bahamas has signed three treaties of mutual </footnote>7 4

under the Ministry of Social Services and Community Development is to be notified 
immediately, so that it can take urgent action to assess the situation. At the time of the visit 
there was no recorded case of child trafficking in the Bahamas. The Ministry of Social 
Services and Community Development informed the Special Rapporteur that it was 
assessing a case of potential domestic-labour exploitation of a child of Haitian origin. 
Moreover, the Inter-Ministry Committee underlined that the Bahamas was facing a growing 
issue of migrant child labour, especially in tourist areas, where children brought from </footnote>4 6 
</p>
<p>C. Identification of trafficked persons.................................................................  35&#8211;<footnote name="4">9. Section 14 of the Trafficking in Persons Act stipulates that the Director of 
Immigration should grant, as appropriate, temporary residency authorization to identified 
victims in order to facilitate the investigation and prosecution processes. The provision 
prima facie suggests that such authorization might be contingent on victims&#8217; cooperation in 
judicial proceedings; however, the Government informed the Special Rapporteur that the 
temporary residency permit provided for in the Act is not contingent on such cooperation. 
The Special Rapporteur notes that, despite the provisions, one of the two Jamaican victims 
under the care of the State at the time of the visit had an expired temporary stay permit, for 
which renewal had been delayed for a month due to a lack of timely coordination between 
the Department of Social Services and the Department of Immigration. The national legal 
framework does not provide for the option for victims of trafficking to seek permanent 
residence in the Bahamas if they so wish. Such provisions are important for those victims 
who cannot return to their community of origin because it would not be in their best interest 
or because it might put them at further risk of being trafficked again or facing reprisal.

<p>G. Repatriation and reintegration ........................................................................  61&#8211;<footnote name="6">4. Public awareness of the phenomena of trafficking in persons remains limited,

the more worrisome that so far national efforts have mainly been deployed on the island of 
New Providence, in particular in Nassau, whereas a large number of migrants have arrived 
and worked on the island of Grand Bahama.  
</footnote>3 16 
</p>
<p>H. Prevention.......................................................................................................  64&#8211;<footnote name="7">1. The Government of the Bahamas has demonstrated good appreciation of the 
transnational nature of trafficking, which requires the participation of source, transit and 
destination countries, as well as bilateral partners in anti-trafficking work, including in the 
areas of identification of victims, exchange of information, joint investigations, judicial 
cooperation and capacity-building.

</p>
<p>I. Cooperation and partnership...........................................................................  71&#8211;<footnote name="7">. It was reported that in some cases Haitian smugglers, with the complicity of 
Bahamian nationals, recruit candidates and potential victims from Haiti. Smugglers lure and 
persuade poor rural Haitians, promising that they can offer them a better life by taking them 
first to the Bahamas for a short period of time and then transporting them to Florida in the 
United States. In those situations, the role of the Bahamian national is to reassure the rural 
communities in Haiti that he or she will provide jobs for the migrants once they arrive in 
the Bahamas. It is in that context that some poor Haitian farmers have sold their meagre 
belongings to finance the perilous journey for their children, which costs, on average, 
US$ 625. The smuggling of migrants has reportedly led to serious human rights abuses, 
including ill-treatment on board overcrowded boats, rape, and food and water deprivation; 
some people have been left with no choice but to jump into the sea and swim to the shores 
or drown. Such smuggling is of serious concern, as it could be a gateway to trafficking in 
persons for the purpose of labour exploitation. 
</footnote>7 17 
</p>
<p> III. Conclusions and recommendations.........................................................................  78&#8211;<footnote name="9">. Lately there has been an increased influx of Filipino nationals brought into the 
country on domestic work permits. The system in place does not provide safeguards to 
ensure that those migrant workers do not fall into situations of grave exploitation. More 
worrisome is the fact that the Employment Act of 2001 does not provide for the protection 
of domestic workers. The small number of labour inspectors on the national territory does 
not allow for the prevention, identification or protection of potential victims of trafficking 
in situations of labour exploitation.  
</footnote>1 18 
</p>
<p>A. Conclusions ....................................................................................................  78&#8211;<footnote name="8">. Moreover, the growing demand for migrant domestic workers seems to have 
favoured precarious working conditions for those workers who are undocumented. While 
the absence of available data makes it difficult to assess the phenomenon of domestic 
servitude in the country, undocumented migrants from Haiti are known to constitute the 
largest share of domestic workers, and reportedly often find themselves in positions of 
vulnerability and exploitation due to their immigration status. It was reported that Haitian 
nationals and stateless persons of Haitian descent are employed as undeclared workers on 
the island of Grand Bahama.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. From 9 to 11 December 2013, the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children, conducted an official visit to the Bahamas at the invitation 
of the Government. 
</p>
<p>2. During the visit, which took her to Nassau and Freeport, she met with high-ranking 
government officials from the Ministry of National Security, the Ministry of Social 
Services and Community Development, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Immigration, 
and the Ministry of Labour and National Insurance, as well as from the Office of the 
Attorney General and Ministry of Legal Affairs and the Ministry for Grand Bahama. She 
also met with representatives of the Royal Bahamas Police Force and the Royal Bahamas 
Defence Force. She held meetings with the Inter-Ministry Committee on Trafficking in 
Persons, the coordinating body for policy matters relating to trafficking in persons, and with 
the Trafficking in Persons Task Force, the operational body for providing assistance to 
victims and ensuring coordination between government agencies and non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) on matters relating to trafficking in persons. The Special Rapporteur 
also visited the migrant detention facility, and met with civil society organizations and 
victims of trafficking during a visit to the government-run safe house. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur expresses her sincere gratitude to the Government for its 
support before and during the mission as well as for welcoming her as the first Special 
Rapporteur of the United Nations to visit the country. She commends the Government for 
opening up to the United Nations human rights system and hopes that the visit paves the 
road for further engagement with other special procedures mandate holders and with the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Main findings 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Forms and manifestations of trafficking in persons  
</b></p>
<p>4. The Bahamas is a transit and destination country for trafficked persons from the 
Caribbean region and from Central and South America. Due to its geographical location, its 
proximity to the United States of America and its porous coastal borders, spanning about 
100,000 square miles, the Bahamas is a major transit country for migrants attempting to 
enter the United States. Criminals and migrant smugglers have taken advantage of the 
migration fluxes to lure and deceive victims, promising to take them to the United States 
but actually taking them to the Bahamas, increasing their vulnerabilities to trafficking and 
exploitation as well as to criminalization by authorities for irregular entry into the country. 
According to information gathered, migrants from the subregion pay US$ 5,000 or more to 
be smuggled to the United States via the Bahamas. The Special Rapporteur met with 
women from the Dominican Republic who had been deceived, then transported in 
precarious and dangerous conditions to the Bahamas, where they were abandoned, 
blindfolded, in a house, only for law enforcement officers to raid the house and arrest them 
a few days later. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>commercial sexual exploitation, whereby women and girls, mainly from the Dominican 
Republic and Jamaica, are made to dance in bars and sell sexual services. Trafficking for 
labour exploitation is thought to be occurring in the construction, agriculture, fishing and 
domestic work sectors. There have been suspected cases of labour exploitation of Haitian, 
Filipino, Chinese, Dominican and Colombian nationals and other migrants from South 
America. 
</p>
<p>6. The traffickers&#8217; modus operandi includes the confiscation of victims&#8217; passports, as 
well as the use of debt bondage to recover the cost of travel, the fees to supposedly extend 
the work permit, and rent, which could amount to a total of US$ 3,000 or more over a 
period of six months. Jamaican women have been brought to the Bahamas by air on visitor 
visas, on the promise that they would be provided nanny or cashier jobs and a work permit 
upon arrival, only to realize that they had been lured into a situation of exploitation. They 
also become aware that they are irregular migrants on Bahamian territory, which further 
deters them from reaching out to authorities. The Special Rapporteur received information 
that in some instances women and girls have been held indoors and deprived of their 
freedom of movement, constantly under the surveillance of a pimp. The rescued victims 
interviewed by the Special Rapporteur reported that they had been trafficked by Bahamian-
born Jamaicans who had recruited them from their communities of origin in Jamaica. 
Haitians arrive in the Bahamas mainly by sea while Dominicans are reported to arrive by 
air.  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.5 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>trafficking was available, according to discussions held with civil society interlocutors it 
appears that Haitian children working as domestic servants are vulnerable to exploitative 
work conditions. No information was received with regard to the exploitation of children 
for sexual tourism. However, mention was made of potential cases of sexual exploitation of 
teenage girls, including Haitian girls, by &#8220;boyfriends&#8221; acting as pimps. 
</p>
<p>11. Root causes of trafficking include poverty and a lack of economic opportunities in 
source countries, but also the high demand, on the part of middle- to high-income 
households in the Bahamas, for cheap domestic work and demand for cheap commercial 
sexual services. It is worth noting that Bahamian nationals have been reluctant to take up 
low-paying domestic work, thus leaving the sector in need of a foreign workforce.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Legal, policy and institutional frameworks for combating trafficking 
in persons 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) International and regional framework  
</b>12. At the international level, the Government of the Bahamas has ratified a number of 
legal instruments, including the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in 
Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention 
against Transnational Organized Crime (the Palermo Protocol); the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women; International Labour 
Organization (ILO) Conventions No. 29 (1930) concerning Forced or Compulsory Labour 
and No. 182 (1999) concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination 
of the Worst Forms of Child Labour; and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The 
Bahamas has yet to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, the International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families and ILO Convention No. 189 (2011) concerning Decent Work for Domestic 
Workers. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>especially women, adolescents, and children, urging member States to take action against 
human trafficking through &#8220;multidimensional actions&#8221; under domestic legislation and 
recommending the establishment of a national and bilateral or multilateral coordination 
mechanism. 
</p>
<p><b> (b) National framework 
</b>15. At the national level, the Constitution protects individuals from inhuman and 
degrading treatment (art. 17) and prohibits slavery and forced labour (art. 18). The 
Bahamas enacted the Trafficking in Persons (Prevention and Suppression) Act in 2008, 
which includes the definition of trafficking in persons as set by article 3 of the Palermo 
Protocol and establishes criminal offences for trafficking in persons. The anti-trafficking 
legislation punishes unlawful withholding of identification papers, transporting a person for 
the purpose of exploitation, including commercial sexual exploitation, forced labour, 
practices similar to slavery, servitude and the illicit removal of organs. 
</p>
<p>16. According to the provisions of the Trafficking in Persons Act (sect. 3, para. 1), 
whoever engages in or conspires to engage in, or attempts to engage in, or assists or 
otherwise facilitates another person to engage in trafficking in persons shall be sentenced, 
on summary conviction, to three to five years&#8217; imprisonment, shall be subject to forfeiture 
of property and shall be ordered to pay full restitution to the victim. If such a person is 
convicted by the Supreme Court, the sentence ranges between a minimum of five years&#8217; 
imprisonment and a maximum of life imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>17. The Act further provides for the protection of victims&#8217; safety, for their immunity 
from prosecution and for their assistance. It also clearly spells out that consent and the 
victim&#8217;s sexual history are irrelevant when determining the status of the victim as being 
subjected to trafficking in persons.  
18. The anti-trafficking legislation covers child pornography in the definition of sexual 
exploitation and establishes the trafficking of minors as an aggravating circumstance 
(sect. 8, para. 1 (c)).  
19. In addition, other relevant legislation may be invoked to prosecute trafficking-
related offences. The Sexual Offences and Domestic Violence Act of 2006 criminalizes 
rape (sect. 6) and forced detention of an individual for sexual purposes (sect. 7 (a)&#8211;(g)), 
with prison sentences of eight years. In the case of child victims under the age of 16, the 
Act provides for sentences ranging from seven years to life imprisonment. The Act also 
punishes forced prostitution (sect. 20, para. 1 (a) and (b)) with a prison sentence of 14 
years; and criminalizes prostitution, an offence punishable by imprisonment for eight years. 
The Special Rapporteur recalls that States have the responsibility to apply due diligence and 
ensure that the prohibition of prostitution does not lead to the revictimization of those 
trafficked for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation.  
</p>
<p>20. The Employment Act sets out minimum labour protection standards, including: 
minimum standard working hours, the provision of paid leave and overtime compensation. 
It further prohibits the employment of children under 14 years of age. However, the Act 
does not provide for the protection of domestic workers, which remains a widely 
unregulated sector. While labour inspectors are provided with a mandate to inspect 
businesses, they cannot inspect homes even in case of reasonable suspicion. The Special 
Rapporteur is concerned that there are fewer than 10 labour inspectors for the whole 
country and that often business owners and employers have been tipped off on impending 
labour inspections. Therefore, in this context it is very unlikely that victims of trafficking in 
a situation of labour exploitation will be identified. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p><b> (c) Immigration policy  
</b>21. The Bahamas is located in a complex migratory environment and exposed to 
substantial irregular migration flows. In 2009, the International Organization for Migration 
(IOM) estimated that between 20,000 and 50,000 undocumented Haitians were living in the 
Bahamas.1 The Immigration Act of 1967 contains provisions on the entry, residence, transit, 
and exit of migrants, and also criminalizes violations related to immigration status. 
Immigration officers have the authority to detain anyone refused entry pending removal 
from the country (sect. 25, para. 4). Any foreign national apprehended in the country after 
having irregularly crossed the Bahamian borders is subject to detention and removal 
(sect. 26).  
22. The Act stipulates that irregular migrants are liable to pay a fine of up to US$ 300 
dollars and/or imprisonment for up to 12 months (sect. 19, para. 2). Irregular migrants have 
been detained in the Carmichael Road Detention Centre, the only dedicated immigration 
detention centre in the country, which is located in Nassau. At the time of the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s visit the centre housed 133 detainees comprising 12 to 15 different 
nationalities, including several detainees from India, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Haiti 
and Colombia, one from Kenya, one from Eritrea and one from Ghana, among others. The 
Special Rapporteur expressed concern with regard to the poor conditions and the length of 
detention, which do not meet international standards. The centre was obviously 
overcrowded, as the main section for men had a capacity of only 70 beds and one room for 
sanitary facilities.  
</p>
<p>23. Although no children were present in the detention centre at the time of the visit, the 
Special Rapporteur notes with deep concern that children have been detained with their 
mothers for lack of alternative facilities and measures to cater to this population of 
undocumented migrants and in violation of all relevant international human rights and 
humanitarian norms. This is all the more alarming since, according to IOM, the majority of 
persons entering the Bahamas are Haitian children under the age of 14.<footnote name="2">Ibid. </footnote> 
</p>
<p>24. Some of the migrants informed the Special Rapporteur that they had been detained 
for over 12 months, one of them for several years. The authorities justified the lengthy 
detention of certain individuals as a result of challenges in communicating with certain 
countries of origin to receive identification and travel documents in order to proceed with 
the removal process; but also mentioned complications in obtaining transit visas for those 
whose return travel itineraries transit through several countries.  
</p>
<p>25. According to the testimony of the Dominican women who were detained at the time 
of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, immigration officers found them blindfolded in a house in 
the island of Grand Bahama, where their smugglers had abandoned them after telling them 
they had reached the United States. They were immediately brought before a judge and 
sentenced to pay a US$ 300 fine for the offence of irregular entry, without ever being 
properly screened to determine whether they had been trafficked. It is only when they 
reached the undocumented migrants detention centre in Nassau that they finally received 
medical screening. That testifies to the poor implementation of screenings to identify 
victims of trafficking, and to detect persons in need of humanitarian protection. Despite the 
fact that one of the women was three months pregnant she remained in detention awaiting 
the execution of the removal order.

</b></p>
<p>26. The expedited processing and sentencing of irregular migrants apprehended in 
Grand Bahama is partly explained by the fact that Freeport does not have a facility to host 
irregular migrants, despite the large numbers of undocumented migrants apprehended at 
this location. The Government also informed the Special Rapporteur that immigration 
officers and law enforcement officers in Grand Bahama needed to receive more training in 
identifying and assisting individuals in need of international protection, as capacity-
building efforts have been mainly concentrated in Nassau. 
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur warns that restrictive immigration policies further endangers 
vulnerable persons, who are put at risk of further violation and victimization if not properly 
identified by law enforcement officers.  
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur received information that the Government of the Bahamas 
has started to consider alternatives to detention for refugees, asylum seekers and, on certain 
occasions, for migrants, based on humanitarian grounds. The Government also took steps in 
2012 to provide permanent residency for several long-term recognized refugees, most of 
Cuban and Haitian origin. Those initiatives are welcomed and should be extended to all 
persons in need of international protection. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>29. At the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, the Bahamas had yet to finalize the 
national action plan to combat trafficking in persons, which is focused on prevention and 
assistance for victims. The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that the plan 
would incorporate existing guidelines that had been developed to ensure the protection of 
victims of trafficking in persons and the prosecution of offenders.  
</p>
<p>30. The Ministry of National Security, which has the primary responsibility for 
combating trafficking in persons, developed in 2012 the Guidelines for the Prevention, 
Suppression and Punishment of Trafficking in Persons, setting out practical measures 
which government officials and other partners have been encouraged to implement to 
further strengthen action to identify victims and potential victims of trafficking, to bring 
traffickers to justice and to enhance other counter-trafficking measures. The Guidelines also 
provide for standard operating procedures for: interviews; assistance and protection; 
medical care for victims; investigation; prosecution and punishment; data collection; 
coordination; cooperation; and international partnership. The Ministry of National Security, 
the Ministry of Social Services and Community Development and the Ministry with 
responsibility for immigration have the lead responsibility for oversight of the Guidelines. 
However, the Special Rapporteur notes that there are neither measures nor indicators in 
place to evaluate the effective implementation of the Guidelines and their impact. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Bahamas has adopted a multisectoral and multidisciplinary approach in 
combating trafficking in persons. The Inter-Ministry Committee on Trafficking in Persons 
was established in November 2011. It is the coordinating body for policy matters relating to 
trafficking in persons. As such, it provides advice on trafficking matters and makes 
recommendations to strengthen national anti-trafficking initiatives, including through the 
identification of opportunities for training, dissemination of information, public awareness 
and coordination. It is comprised of senior government officials from the Ministry of 
National Security, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Immigration, the Ministry of 
Finance, the Ministry of Labour and National Insurance, the Ministry of Social Services 
and Community Development and the Ministry of Health, as well as representatives from 
the Royal Bahamas Police Force, the Royal Bahamas Defence Force, the Department of 
Immigration, the Customs Department and the Office of the Attorney General and Ministry 
of Legal Affairs </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>32. The Trafficking in Persons Task Force, established in March 2012, is responsible for 
addressing matters relating to trafficking in persons ranging from the identification of 
victims to the prosecution of alleged traffickers, and serves as a forum for ensuring 
coordination between government agencies and NGOs working on trafficking in persons. It 
is comprised of government ministries and agencies, including those involved in the Inter-
Ministry Committee (see para. 31 above), as well as representatives from four non-
governmental, community and faith-based organizations, namely: the Bahamas Crisis 
Centre, the Bahamas Red Cross Society, The Links, Incorporated and the Bahamas 
Christian Council. In carrying out its role, the Task Force can establish subcommittees. At 
the time of the visit, two functional subcommittees had been established: one on housing 
and one on raising public awareness, although no information was provided on their exact 
mandates.  
</p>
<p>33. The Ministry of National Security operates as the secretariat with responsibility for 
bringing together the members of the Inter-Ministry Committee and the Task Force and 
ensuring their proper functioning. It is envisaged that in the future, a special project unit in 
the Police Force will be created to coordinate and administer the activities of the Task 
Force, with members of the Task Force answerable to the unit; which would be headed by a 
senior officer and an assistant, both from the organized crime section of the Task Force. At 
the time of the visit, the Government had allocated US$ 100,000 for the coordination of all 
anti-trafficking efforts. 
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur notes that, although the establishment of a dedicated task 
force is a positive step, the Task Force needs an institutionalized mandate, an allocated 
budget, a work plan with clear goals, and indicators to measure output, as well as a 
dedicated secretariat with trained professionals to efficiently carry out the mandate. 
Moreover, the Special Rapporteur notes that the engagement with the civil society needs to 
be strengthened and widened.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Identification of trafficked persons 
</b></p>
<p>35. The 2012 Guidelines provide that victims of trafficking or potential victims may be 
identified through special law enforcement operations by the Royal Bahamas Police Force 
or the Department of Immigration and during migrant operations by the Royal Bahamas 
Defence Force; by medical professionals in hospitals and clinics; through observations and 
intelligence gathering on the Internet; and on the basis of referral by the general population. 
The police has the primary responsibility for identifying trafficked persons and works 
closely with the prosecutor&#8217;s office in charge of confirming the status of the referred 
individual as a victim. Officers of the Department of Immigration are instructed to report to 
the police all observations of possible cases of trafficking, especially in contexts of sexual 
exploitation and forced labour. In carrying out their responsibilities to ensure occupational 
safety and health in accordance with the Health and Safety at Work Act of 2002, labour 
inspectors are instructed to report to the police any observations that trafficking in persons 
may be occurring; the police subsequently relays the information to the Inter-Ministry 
Committee and the Special Investigative Unit within the Task Force. 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>Central America by organized networks are made to sell goods. Although there has been no 
evidence of trafficking cases to date, the situation of those children should be carefully 
monitored, as the persons running the networks seem to be taking advantage of mixed 
migratory flows.  
</p>
<p>37. The Department of Social Services within the Ministry of Social Services and 
Community Development informed the Special Rapporteur that a national hotline run by 
social workers had been established in Nassau and Grand Bahama to enable the reporting, 
by the general public, of gender-based violence and potential cases of trafficking in 
persons. In addition, the Special Rapporteur was informed that referrals could also be made 
through the Bahamas Crisis Centre. However, the hotline provides services in English only, 
thus limiting direct access for victims who are non-English speakers. The Special 
Rapporteur emphasizes that in order to be useful, the hotlines have to provide services in 
Creole, Spanish and, eventually, Mandarin to also be accessible to potential victims 
originating from Haiti, the Dominican Republic and other countries in Latin America, and 
China. Another major pitfall is the lack of awareness of the existence of the hotline. The 
general public appears to be largely unaware of the hotline, and statistical data on received 
calls were not provided. 
</p>
<p>38. The Inter-Ministry Committee informed the Special Rapporteur that the Royal 
Bahamas Defence Force had included a training module on awareness of trafficking in 
persons as part of the training for new enlisted personnel, as well as advancement and 
leadership courses. The Government reported that more than 240 service personnel have 
taken part in the programme. Training on the identification of victims and potential victims 
of trafficking is included in the module. Moreover, in the context of anti-smuggling 
operations, which are frequent in the Bahamian waters, defence forces have been sensitized 
on indicators to look for to identify victims of trafficking. However, the training 
programmes are still at an early stage and the number of trained officers has yet to become 
substantial.  
</p>
<p>39. Despite the development of guidelines to address trafficking in persons, including 
indicators for the identification of victims, the Special Rapporteur found that there is a need 
to develop comprehensive interview protocols incorporating a checklist enabling the 
detection of red flags. Law enforcement agents have to keep in mind that victims may not 
be forthcoming in telling the whole story and that sometimes they are coached by 
traffickers on responses to be given. Taking those factors into account, it is crucial that 
interviews are conducted on a one-on-one basis, to respect privacy and confidentiality.  
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that capacity-building through training on 
identification is important, and that identification protocols should be mainstreamed across 
the institutions coming into contact with potential victims. Specific training in the area of 
and questionnaires for unaccompanied minors should be developed, especially in a context 
where a large majority of those smuggled are minors, according to IOM statistics. The 
Government should also establish a harmonized data collection system whereby incidences 
of trafficking are recorded, in order to identify the trend, scope and manifestations of 
trafficking in the Bahamas and enhance identification, and design informed anti-trafficking 
responses.  
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur also received information on the alleged involvement of law 
enforcement officials in migrant smuggling operations, especially those involving boats 
transporting Haitians with the complicity of Bahamian nationals. The Special Rapporteur 
expressed concern that if such allegations are not properly investigated and action taken 
accordingly, it may hamper the effective identification of trafficked persons and may also 
result in distrust of law enforcement officers by trafficked persons.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>42. Finally, law enforcement officers alone cannot carry the burden of the first 
identification; a proper referral mechanism needs to be developed to facilitate referrals of 
potential cases by the general population. Furthermore, in the best interest of the victim it is 
important that social workers be present during immigration raids and marine border 
control operations so as to provide the necessary first assistance to persons in positions of 
vulnerability caught in mixed migration flows, including potential victims of trafficking. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Assistance for victims 
</b></p>
<p>43. Section 20, paragraph 1, of the Trafficking in Persons Act stipulates that &#8220;the 
Minister responsible for national security in conjunction with the Minister responsible for 
social services shall develop a plan in consultation with non-governmental organizations 
and other representatives of civil society for the provision of appropriate services from 
governmental and non-governmental sources to victims of trafficking and dependent 
children accompanying the victims&#8221;. Such services are defined by the law to include safe 
housing; psychological counselling in a language that the victim understands; medical 
assistance; employment, educational and training assistance; and legal assistance. The age, 
gender and special needs of victims are to be taken into account when planning and 
delivering such services. To provide a framework in which to operationalize those legal 
provisions the Government developed the Plan to Provide Assistance to Victims of 
Trafficking in Persons and Their Accompanying Dependent Children, covering the period 
2013&#8211;2016. The framework has been coordinated by the Ministry of National Security and 
the Ministry of Social Services and Community Development in consultation with the 
Inter-Ministry Committee and the Task Force. The implementation of the Plan is to be 
assessed yearly vis-&#224;-vis the effectiveness of the services for the victims and their 
accompanying dependent children and to take into account the dynamic nature of the crime 
of trafficking in persons. Under the plan, each entity providing services to trafficking 
victims is requested to establish an effective data collection system to track the services 
provided to such victims. The data should include information pertaining to the number of 
trafficked victims assisted each year; the number of employees who provide assistance to 
the victims and the approximate cost of the services provided. However, the plan was only 
recently finalized, in 2013, and no evaluation was available at the time of the visit.  
</p>
<p>44. The Trafficking in Persons Investigation Section of the RBPF Central Detective 
Unit is mandated to provide assistance for the immediate removal of victims from the 
environment of exploitation and transfer them to a safe location. The Trafficking in Persons 
Act further provides that the Ministry of National Security should ensure the security of 
victims and members of their families residing in the Bahamas. 
</p>
<p>45. In accordance with the Plan, the Department of Social Services is charged with 
defining a tailored assistance programme for each identified victim. The Plan also provides 
that once victims are identified, victim service providers, such as the Bermuda Crisis 
Centre, the Bahamas Red Cross Society or other NGOs or faith-based and community 
organizations, should provide, inter alia, pre-arranged shelter, medical assistance and legal 
advice. For example, the Bahamas Red Cross Society has a number of services that have 
been extended to victims of trafficking, including the Meals on Wheels programme, 
through which hot meals and food staples are delivered to victims, and a programme in 
which clothing, hygiene kits and household items are distributed throughout New 
Providence from Monday to Friday. However, it is not clear whether NGOs have developed 
specific projects to assist victims of trafficking in persons with trained staff and specific 
indicators to measure the impact of their activities.  
</p>
<p>46. At the time of the visit, there was no government-run shelter in the Bahamas; 
victims were hosted in safe houses and provided with basic necessities, such as clothing, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>food and toiletries. The Bureau of Women&#8217;s Affairs, under the Ministry of Social Services 
and Community Development, established a partnership with the Bahamas Crisis Centre, a 
non-profit, independent organization primarily pledged to respond to the needs of all 
victims of sexual, physical and psychological abuse, including victims of trafficking. 
According to the 2012 Guidelines, the centre, which acts as a focal point for the support of 
victims and potential victims of trafficking in persons, operates a hotline for victims of 
abuse, including victims of trafficking in persons. It provides victims with, among other 
things, emergency shelter and counselling and receives a yearly grant from the 
Government. The Government also has a partnership with the Links Safe House, a 
residential facility which provides shelter for victims of domestic violence, and which is 
also open to victims or potential victims of trafficking in persons for labour exploitation. 
The Links Safe House also receives an annual subsidy from the Government. At the time of 
the visit, no victims of trafficking were being sheltered by either of those organizations and 
the Special Rapporteur regrets that attempts to visit the premises were unsuccessful. 
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur was informed of the difficulties of providing a dedicated 
shelter in a small country such as the Bahamas, as it would be difficult to maintain safety 
and confidentiality. The Special Rapporteur regretted that, although victims have been 
provided shelter in safe houses, that system operates on an ad hoc basis, with no 24-hour 
on-site supervision or counselling. Moreover, victims regrettably are not provided with 
monthly allowances, which has a significant impact on access to dignified living. This is all 
the more worrisome as no victim has been provided with a temporary work permit, despite 
the fact that those engaged in legal proceedings have remained under the protection of the 
State for more than six months, time during which they have not been able to earn a living 
and support the families they left behind. The situation puts the rescued victims in a 
position of vulnerability to exploitation and vis-&#224;-vis traffickers, as they may be tempted to 
look for ways to earn a living in the informal market. It further creates psychological and 
moral distress, as victims often leave behind families that they need to care for. Therefore, 
it is important that the Government rapidly allocates funds for the provision of monthly 
allowances to victims who are being assisted. 
</p>
<p>48. The Department of Social Services informed the Special Rapporteur that it had 
provided assistance to three Jamaican women trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation 
and to two men from the Dominican Republic identified as potential victims of labour 
exploitation. The victims were sheltered in two different locations and their needs were 
assessed by social workers. IOM provided support in safely repatriating two victims.  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>mobilized for the identification of, and provision of assistance to, victims, namely through 
awareness-raising and adequate training. Partially outsourcing victim assistance to NGOs 
has proven to be optimal in several countries. The Special Rapporteur underlined that 
trafficking in persons could be efficiently tackled only through a multi-stakeholder 
approach, with civil society being a major player.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Investigation, prosecution and punishment 
</b></p>
<p>51. RBPF is in charge of investigating trafficking offences; its representatives on the 
Task Force are part of a specialized unit with experience in dealing with victims of sexual 
crimes, including victims and potential victims of trafficking in persons. The specialized 
investigative unit acts to ensure that all partners are engaged when a trafficking matter 
comes to its attention. RBPF is charged with keeping a record on investigations into and 
cases of trafficking in persons.  
</p>
<p>52. The Guidelines provide that an investigator should be assigned to each trafficking 
case and early consultation should be undertaken between the RBPF investigators and the 
prosecutors in order to ensure that all possible evidence is explored and that the correct 
charge or charges are pressed. 
</p>
<p>53. The Office of the Attorney General and Ministry of Legal Affairs is in charge of 
prosecuting cases of trafficking and has established a team of trained prosecutors with 
special skills in interacting with victims of trafficking. The prosecutors themselves are to be 
in direct contact with victims and to assess their situation in order to confirm their status as 
victims. The Attorney General informed the Special Rapporteur that the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office 
was developing a partnership with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland to develop protocols for the investigation and prosecution of trafficking in persons. 
A tailored criminal justice response to trafficking is planned to be operational in 2014.  
54. Trafficking offences can be tried before both the Supreme Court and magistrate 
courts, and the Attorney General reported that a system of swift justice had been established 
for the speedy trial of cases of trafficking in persons. Prosecutors in the Office of the 
Attorney General and Ministry of Legal Affairs who specialize in the prosecution of sexual 
offence cases are also involved in the prosecution of trafficking-related cases. The 
Government is considering the creation of a specialized court to try sexual offences, 
including trafficking-related cases. However, the first trafficking case was referred to the 
Supreme Court, in view of its tougher sentencing, to send a strong message that the 
Bahamas will not tolerate that type of crime.  
</p>
<p>55. A number of legal provisions ensure the protection of victims during the 
investigation and prosecution phases. The Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Act of 
2011 includes as &#8220;qualifying offences&#8221; crimes committed under the Trafficking in Persons 
Act and provides for the protection of the identity of witnesses during the investigation of 
criminal offences and during criminal proceedings and matters connected therewith, and for 
the admissibility of evidence in criminal proceedings to be obtained by way of live 
television link. Section 13 of the Trafficking in Persons Act recommends that witnesses 
should be considered for entry into the witness protection programme established under the 
Justice Protection Act of 2006 if it is determined that they are at risk of being subject to 
violent reprisals. It also allows for cases to be tried in camera in order to protect 
victims/witnesses. The Trafficking in Persons Act also provides the possibility for victims 
to deliver impact statements. The amended section 185 of the Criminal Procedure Code,3 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>which allows the Court to receive any relevant representation from the victim before 
handing down a sentence, is applicable to victims of trafficking.  
</p>
<p>56. At the time of the visit, the Bahamas was prosecuting its first two cases of 
trafficking in persons. The cases concerned two Jamaican women who were allegedly 
trafficked by two Jamaican women residing in the Bahamas. A Bahamian man was also 
involved in one of the cases, including in the transportation of the victim. The two victims 
were allegedly trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation and lured by the promise of a 
job. The victims reported that they were afraid to denounce their situation to the police as 
they had become irregular migrants, an argument which was also used by their traffickers to 
exert pressure on them. One of the victims was rescued during an immigration raid in a bar 
and the other was identified by the police during an identity check. The Government 
informed the Special Rapporteur, after the mission, that a third case was being tried before 
a magistrate court; it concerns a woman who was forced to dance in a nightclub and 
prostitute herself.  
</p>
<p>57. In one of the cases the presumed trafficker was charged with trafficking in persons, 
unlawful withholding of identification documents and transporting. If convicted by the 
Supreme Court the alleged traffickers could be sentenced to 5 years&#8217; to life imprisonment, 
subjected to forfeiture of property and ordered to pay full restitution to the victim. 
Aggravating circumstances are also provided for in section 8, paragraph 1 (a) to (h). An 
additional 2 years&#8217; imprisonment could be imposed for the use of or threats to use a 
dangerous weapon, an additional 3 years if the trafficking was part of the activity of an 
organized criminal group; and an additional 4 years if the trafficking occurred as a result of 
the abuse of power or a position of authority. An additional 5 years&#8217; imprisonment could be 
imposed if the victim was subjected to serious bodily injury or sexual assault, if the victim 
is a minor or if the victim was exposed to a life-threatening illness or to drug addiction. An 
additional 10 years&#8217; imprisonment could be imposed if the victim suffered a permanent life-
threatening injury. 
58. Despite the recent positive developments, the Special Rapporteur notes that the 
prosecution rate remains relatively low considering that the Trafficking in Persons Act was 
enacted in 2008. That emphasizes the need for the Government to strengthen capacities for 
the identification of victims and also strengthen the activities of prosecutors in charge of 
confirming the status of victims of trafficking. In that regard the Special Rapporteur notes 
that mandating the prosecutors alone to determine the status of victims might not be in the 
best interest of victims. Social workers need to be involved at the very first stages of the 
identification of status so as to guarantee victims access to appropriate assistance regardless 
of whether or not they decide to cooperate with the judicial process.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Redress for victims of trafficking 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>automatically depriving those victims who are reluctant to file complaints against their 
traffickers from obtaining restitution and compensation. The Special Rapporteur advocates 
for the establishment of a victims&#8217; fund to allow for the compensation of all victims. 
</p>
<p>60. Another important means of redress, specifically for victims of labour trafficking, is 
the recovery of unpaid wages; however, no information was provided on the possibility for 
victims to lodge civil cases for unpaid wages. Notwithstanding, the Employment Act 
stipulates that where an employer is found guilty of an offence in respect of any employee, 
the court may, in addition to any other penalty, order the employer to pay to the employee 
any overtime pay, vacation pay, or other wages to which the employee is entitled under the 
Act, the non-payment or insufficient payment of which constituted the offence (sect. 76). 
Moreover, the Special Rapporteur notes that the Immigration Act (sect. 29, para. 3) 
criminalizes employers who hire undocumented migrants; therefore fines imposed on those 
who employ undocumented migrants could also be used to compensate victims of 
trafficking who have suffered labour exploitation. </p>
<p><b> G. Repatriation and reintegration 
</b></p>
<p>61. The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that, at the time of the visit, one 
of the three identified victims from Jamaica (see para. 48 above) had been repatriated to her 
country of origin with the help of IOM. The Government of Jamaica provided support in 
that regard. The Bahamas have set a good practice in cooperating with the Jamaican police, 
which verified the victim&#8217;s place of origin to ensure her safe return.  
</p>
<p>62. There was no information on the reintegration of victims, either in communities of 
origin or in the Bahamas. The plan to assist victims of trafficking mentions that victims 
should be provided with information on access to services available to them in the Bahamas 
or in their home country should they wish to be repatriated, in order to ensure a sustainable 
reintegration process. However, it is not clear whether any reintegration services are 
available yet and, if so, what they consist in. Moreover, the Department of Labour had yet 
to provide information to the Inter-Ministry Committee with regard to assisting victims 
with employment opportunities, which is contingent on the delivery of work permits by the 
Department of Immigration.  
</p>
<p>63. Although there is no institutionalized compensation scheme, the Government 
informed the Special Rapporteur that the two Dominican males, who were not identified as 
victims of trafficking in persons, were assisted in their return to their home country and 
provided with a small stipend from funds earmarked for victims of trafficking in persons 
before their repatriation. The Government reported that no cases of labour exploitation had 
been identified in the Bahamas.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Prevention 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Public awareness 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>it had held a public forum on trafficking in persons in March 2012 with a view to fostering 
greater public understanding of the complexities of trafficking in persons, and the 
differences between trafficking in persons, illegal immigration and migrant smuggling. 
</p>
<p>66. The Department of Social Services mentioned the adoption of a new approach and 
strategy to raise public awareness about child abuse, which was inclusive of trafficking in 
children. Elements of the new approach are said to include short messages before the main 
feature in movie theatres, messages on social media and advertisements printed on cash 
register receipts. However, no examples of the awareness-raising support were shown to the 
Special Rapporteur.  
</p>
<p>67. In late 2013, the Task Force produced pamphlets and public service announcements 
on trafficking in persons. The pamphlet distribution was at its preliminary stage at the time 
of the visit. The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that plans were under way to 
have public announcements aired on the private stations in addition to the public channels.  
</p>
<p>68. Additional awareness-raising projects envisaged by the Government include the 
preparation of presentations on trafficking in persons for schools; the organization of 
presentations for the public administration and other organizations by members of the Task 
Force who have participated in the training of trainers sessions conducted by IOM; and the 
production of posters representing specific aspects of trafficking in persons, such as labour 
exploitation. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Safe migration  
</b></p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur has advocated for the establishment of safe migration 
pathways to prevent trafficking in persons, bearing in mind that the Bahamas needs foreign 
workers. In that regard the Government informed the Special Rapporteur that a mechanism 
in place allowed for the delivery of seasonal or temporary work permits. One of the 
conditions for issuing visas at the request of a given company is the departure of foreign 
workers who were previously granted visas to work temporarily in the country for that 
company. However, the system seem to tie the work visa to a single employer, thus 
increasing the vulnerability of migrant workers to the good will of employers and limiting 
their ability to change employer if they so wish. 
</p>
<p>70. The Bahamas also has provisions for 30-day visas for entertainers, such as salsa 
dancers, mainly from Southern American countries. The Special Rapporteur mentioned to 
representatives of the Ministry of Labour and National Insurance that the conditions of 
employment of those workers should be closely screened and monitored to reduce the risk 
of exploitation, especially in the case of women and girls. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Cooperation and partnership 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>legal assistance: with the United States (1987), with the United Kingdom (1988) and with 
Canada (1990). As at the time of the visit no request for assistance had been made under the 
various agreements with regard to trafficking in persons, but the Special Rapporteur 
acknowledged the importance of having such mechanisms in place. 
</p>
<p>73. The Bahamas has memorandums of understanding with Cuba and Haiti providing 
for the expedited deportation of irregular migrants, which have proven not to be conducive 
to the proper screening of persons who might be in need of international protection in 
mixed migratory flows. Concerns were raised that the memorandums might jeopardize the 
welfare of migrants in need of international humanitarian and human rights assistance. 
Therefore, it is urgent that the Bahamas review existing memorandums of understanding 
and ensure that they are in compliance with international standards.  
</p>
<p>74. In May 2012, the Inter-Ministry Committee and the Task Force opened channels of 
communication with the diplomatic and consular corps in the Bahamas, which have been 
encouraged to report any suspicion of trafficking cases.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Capacity-building  
</b></p>
<p>75. The Government reported that the Bahamas was currently partaking, jointly with 
Saint Lucia, in a 36-month project initiated by IOM aimed at strengthening institutions 
dealing with human trafficking. In September and October 2013, the Task Force and Inter-
Ministry Committee members participated in technical skills training and training of 
trainers on trafficking in persons.  
</p>
<p>76. The Bahamas hosted two seminars in 2011: one on &#8220;Strengthening the capacity of 
law enforcement officials, judges and prosecutors in the Caribbean to identify and combat 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children&#8221;, which was held in collaboration 
with the Organization of American States, and another on &#8220;Protecting vulnerable migrants&#8221;, 
organized in collaboration with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees and sponsored by IOM. A partnership was also established with IOM for the 
training of judges and lawyers. The Inter-Ministry Committee members also participated in 
the Caribbean Regional Conference on the Protection of Vulnerable Persons in Mixed 
Migration Flows, organized by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees and IOM, in 2013.  
</p>
<p>77. In March 2012, the Government of the United States conducted a training exercise 
on trafficking in persons for members of the Inter-Ministry Committee and the Task Force, 
and in June 2012 it sponsored a study tour for them in Miami, Florida. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The Bahamas has demonstrated commitment in combating trafficking in 
persons, including through the ratification of international instruments on trafficking, 
the adoption of a national law to combat trafficking in persons in accordance with the 
Palermo Protocol and the development of a multisectoral approach to provide 
assistance and remedies to victims.  
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The Office of the Attorney General has set out good practices in cooperating 
with the Jamaican authorities and creating a precedent for bilateral joint 
investigations of cases of trafficking. The trial of the two cases of human trafficking 
before the magistrate court and the Supreme Court, although coming late, sends a 
strong message to potential traffickers. The existence of agreements for mutual legal </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>assistance between the Bahamas and countries such as the United States of America, 
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Canada is also 
positive, as is the country engagement with international organizations to enhance 
capacity-building at the national level.  
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>However, the country lacks a comprehensive assessment of the trends and 
scope of trafficking, and victims are rarely identified or referred to assistance 
programmes. The restrictive immigration policy leading to the Government&#8217;s rapid 
deportation of migrants, who arrive mainly by boat, especially from Haiti and the 
Dominican Republic, informed by existing memorandums of understanding with the 
countries involved, may lead to the arrest, detention and deportation of potential 
victims of trafficking without providing the opportunity for identification and 
assistance. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s fears are heightened by the fact that there is a 
capacity gap in terms of ability for quick and accurate identification of victims of 
trafficking. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>While the Government has started to incorporate information on human 
trafficking into the regular training curriculum of the Royal Bahamas Police Force 
and the Royal Bahamas Defence Force, there is an urgent need to scale this up and 
continually enhance the knowledge and skills of those front-line officers to identify 
and protect trafficked persons.  
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>Labour inspectors are unable to carry out their functions of inspection and 
monitoring of companies to ensure compliance with labour standards, including, 
importantly, to assist in the identification of trafficked persons and potential victims 
of trafficking, because they have insufficient human capacity and a limited mandate.  
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>Comprehensive assistance for victims remains at a preliminary stage. While 
victims are provided with some assistance, there is no specialized shelter for trafficked 
persons which can respond to victims and provide them with the psychological, 
medical, language and other support services they may need. Furthermore, assisted 
victims do not have access to compensation or a monthly allowance, nor can they 
work while awaiting the outcome of the legal proceedings, which often takes several 
months.  
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>While acknowledging the Government&#8217;s efforts to raise awareness, prevention 
is still at an early stage. The general population and civil society remain unaware of 
both the issue of trafficking and the government action taken to combat and prevent 
it. Existing tools, such as the hotline to report vulnerable or endangered women and 
children, need to be advertised further, and awareness of the different activities 
undertaken by the Government to tackle the issue should be raised in order to 
mobilize and ensure partnerships with grass-roots organizations that may come in 
direct contact with potential victims of trafficking.  
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>In view of the above observations the Special Rapporteur makes the 
recommendations listed below</b>. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>With respect to the international framework, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Ratify, without delay, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p><b> (b) Ratify, without delay, ILO Convention No. 189 (2011) concerning Decent 
Work for Domestic Workers and the International Convention on the Protection of 
the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Ratify, without delay, the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of 
Stateless Persons and the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Establish, with countries of origin and countries of destination, bilateral 
and multilateral agreements for exchange of information, mutual legal assistance and 
safe returns in order to jointly tackle the root causes of trafficking in persons in the 
region; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Develop and review existing safe migration pathways for seasonal or 
temporary workers. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>With respect to the national framework, the Special Rapporteur recommends 
that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Carry out a national baseline study in collaboration with an independent 
research institute, bilateral partners and civil society to document the scope and 
trends of trafficking at the national level; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Finalize and rapidly adopt the national action plan to combat trafficking 
in persons based on a human rights and victim-centred approach, setting out clear 
objectives, responsibilities and indicators to measure progress, and allocate a 
dedicated budget for its implementation; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Establish a systematized and harmonized data collection system on the 
phenomenon of human trafficking. Data on victims of trafficking should include their 
countries of origin and be disaggregated by, inter alia, sex, age and the nature and 
type of trafficking involved; the system should also include information on traffickers 
and data on investigations, prosecution rates and sentencing; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Create by law, in order to enhance coordination and efforts at combating 
trafficking, an office of an independent national rapporteur or an equivalent 
mechanism charged with the responsibility to implement, monitor and evaluate 
activities aimed at combating human trafficking; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Amend the Employment Act in order to provide protection for domestic 
workers in accordance with international legal standards. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>With respect to identification, training and capacity-building, the Special 
Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Specifically outline and harmonize identification protocols using the 
Government&#8217;s guidelines to combat trafficking in persons, developing a range of red 
flags and indicators to be used while screening vulnerable persons and undocumented 
migrants; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Establish a national referral mechanism whereby anyone can, even 
anonymously, report potential victims; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Raise awareness on the distinction between cases of trafficking and 
irregular migration while underlining the impact of mixed migration flows on 
trafficking; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Provide comprehensive training programmes on effective reporting on 
trafficking in persons to enhance knowledge and awareness of human trafficking for 
all stakeholders, including the police, the defence force, immigration and border </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>agents, prosecutors, judges and lawyers, as well as for labour inspectors, civil society 
organizations and the media; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Train all stakeholders involved in providing short- and long-term 
assistance and care to victims of trafficking. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>With respect to support services for victims of trafficking, while the Special 
Rapporteur acknowledges the efforts made to develop a plan to assist victims of 
trafficking, she notes that the guidelines remain general, and recommends that the 
Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Define a set of specific actions to be taken by each stakeholder in order 
to fulfil the duties they are assigned within the framework of the victim assistance 
programme; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Protect and assist all victims of trafficking, including child victims, with 
full respect for their human rights, and integrate a human rights-based approach in 
the investigation of trafficking cases; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Make provision for appropriate support, including the establishment of 
separate shelters for child victims of trafficking and adults. Shelters should also be 
made available outside the capital city; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Ensure that the free 24-hour hotline is accessible in the languages that 
may be the only ones that potential victims speak, such as Creole, Spanish and 
Mandarin, and that the responsible staff are multilingual and receive specific training 
on trafficking in persons; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Provide adequate and regular funding to service providers and 
organizations working on trafficking in persons, both in urban and rural areas, in 
order to enable comprehensive assistance, such as social, psychological, medical and 
legal support, as well as translation and interpretative services, for victims of 
trafficking; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Maintain close cooperation with the International Organization for 
Migration and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for 
the safe return of trafficked victims to their country of origin, having due regard to 
the need, if any, of international protection of the victims and the application of the 
principle of non-refoulement; </b></p>
<p><b> (g) Establish a fund that will provide for a comprehensive national 
compensation scheme for victims of trafficking. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>With respect to prosecution, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Improve the justice delivery system to ensure speedy adjudication of 
cases of trafficking while guaranteeing fair-trial rights consistent with a human 
rights-based approach to criminal justice responses; 
 (b) Ensure that in the prosecution of cases of trafficking, victim/witness 
protection before, during and after the trial is duly implemented to avoid reprisal. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>With respect to prevention, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Step up efforts to raise awareness about all forms of trafficking in 
persons, including for domestic servitude, forced labour and sexual exploitation, in 
order to promote understanding of what constitutes trafficking among the general 
population and the foreign community. In that regard, all family islands of the </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p><b>Bahamas should be sensitized and efforts should not be concentrated in the capital 
city alone; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Translate its efforts into concrete actions and conduct surveys to assess 
the impact of the awareness-raising campaigns, which should be extended to the whole 
country and especially to areas where there is a high concentration of persons in a 
vulnerable position. Moreover, the language factors must be taken into account when 
developing public-awareness supports; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Empower non-governmental organizations, including through increased 
interaction and the provision of funds, to conduct sensitization on trafficking and to 
handle complaints related to trafficking at the grass-roots level; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Launch widespread campaigns to raise public awareness on this issue 
using media outlets, including television and radio stations, and other channels of 
communication in order to promote a common understanding of the phenomenon of 
trafficking and to encourage reporting from the general population.
