DENVER—August 5, 2015—MarkWest Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: MWE) (“the Partnership”) today reported
quarterly cash available for distribution to common unitholders, or distributable cash flow (DCF), of $165.9 million for
the three months ended June 30, 2015, and $346.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. DCF for the three
months ended June 30, 2015 represents distribution coverage of 94 percent. The second quarter distribution of $176.1
million, or $0.92 per common unit, will be paid to unitholders on August 14, 2015. The second quarter 2015 distribution
represents an increase of $0.01 per common unit or 1.1 percent over the first quarter 2015 distribution and an increase
of $0.04 per common unit or 4.5 percent compared to the second quarter 2014 distribution. As a Master Limited
Partnership, cash distributions to common unitholders are largely determined based on DCF. A reconciliation of DCF
to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is provided within the financial tables of this
press release.
The Partnership reported Adjusted EBITDA for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 of $218.9 million and
$448.5 million, respectively, compared to $208.2 million and $395.8 million for the respective three and six months
ended June 30, 2014. The Partnership believes the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information
because it is commonly used by investors in Master Limited Partnerships to assess financial performance and
operating results of ongoing business
1
operations. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial
measure, is provided within the financial tables of this press release.
The Partnership reported loss before provision for income tax for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 of
$97.8 million and $96.4 million respectively. Income before provision for income tax includes non-cash losses
associated with the change in fair value of derivative instruments of $7.4 million and $15.5 million for the respective
three and six months ended June 30, 2015. Income before provision for income tax includes non-cash impairments
associated with our Southwest segment of $25.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Income before
provision for income tax includes non-cash write offs of unamortized discount and deferred financing costs related to
the redemption of debt of $14.7 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. Excluding these items, loss
before provision for income tax for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 would have been $75.7 million and
$40.7 million, respectively.
“We are pleased with the solid second quarter performance, which included record total volumes and the completion of
five major projects that are critical to the continued support of our producer customer drilling programs,” said Frank
Semple, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of MarkWest. “The recently announced  transformative
merger with MPLX is the next step in our growth, and will allow us to continue to develop and invest in the strategic
NGL projects which are critical for producers in the Marcellus and Utica shales.  This merger will create the fourth
largest MLP in the industry, with the unique combination of MarkWest’s best-of-class organic growth and MPLX’s
long-term inventory of drop down EBITDA from Marathon Petroleum Corporation.  The combined company with
the strong parental support and the investment grade balance sheet will support an ongoing
inventory of high-quality, fee-based midstream projects for the business. As mentioned on the
MPLX earnings call last week, the combined partnership provided proforma distribution growth
guidance that results in a mid-twenty percent compound annual growth rate for the next five
years, with a platform that supports an attractive distribution growth profile over an extended
period of time.”
BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS
On July 13, 2015, the Partnership announced that it has entered into a definitive merger agreement, whereby it would
become a wholly owned subsidiary of MPLX LP (NYSE: MPLX). The Partnership’s common unitholders would receive
1.09 MPLX common units and a one-time cash payment of approximately $3.37 per Partnership common unit. The
transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2015 and is subject to approval by the Partnership’s
unitholders, as well as customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.
Marcellus:
·                  In June, the Partnership commenced operations of Majorsville VI, a 200 million cubic feet
per day (MMcf/d) processing plant at the Majorsville complex in Marshall County, West Virginia,
increasing the total processing capacity of the complex to 1.1 Bcf/d. The Partnership expects to
place a seventh 200 MMcf/d plant into service during the second quarter of 2016 to support
Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE: SWN) and other producers.
·                  In June, the Partnership commenced operations of Houston IV, a 200 MMcf/d processing

To support Range’s growing rich-gas volume, the Partnership is constructing the Fox complex in
northern Washington County. Initial development of the Fox complex will consist of a 200 MMcf/d

be placed into service during the fourth quarter of 2016.
2
·                  In July, the Partnership completed Sherwood VI, a 200 MMcf/d processing plant at the

complex to 1.2 Bcf/d. The Partnership expects to complete a seventh 200 MMcf/d processing
plant at the Sherwood complex in the second quarter of 2016.
Utica:
·                  In May, MarkWest Utica EMG, a joint venture between the Partnership and The Energy &
Minerals Group, announced the execution of definitive agreements with Rice Energy (NYSE:
RICE) to support the development of their acreage in eastern Ohio.
·                  In June, MarkWest Utica EMG completed Seneca IV, a 200 MMcf/d processing plant at
the Seneca complex in Noble County, Ohio. The plant is anchored by Antero under a long-term,
fee-based contract, and expands the total processing capacity of the Seneca complex to 800
MMcf/d.
·                  In June, MarkWest Utica EMG placed into service Cadiz III, a 200 MMcf/d processing
plant at the Cadiz complex in Harrison County, Ohio, increasing the total processing capacity of
the complex to 525 MMcf/d. The complex supports growing production from Ascent Resources,
LLC, Gulfport Energy Corporation (NASDAQ: GPOR), and other producers. MarkWest Utica
EMG is constructing a fourth 200 MMcf/d plant at the Cadiz complex that is expected to be in
service by the second quarter of 2016. Once completed, MarkWest Utica EMG will operate over
1.5 Bcf/d in the core rich-gas area of the Utica Shale.
Southwest:
·                  In May, the Partnership announced an 80 MMcf/d expansion of its Carthage IV plant in
Panola County, Texas. The expansion is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter 2015.
·                  In June, the Partnership announced the development of Hidalgo, a 200 MMcf/d
processing plant in Culbertson County, Texas. The new facility is scheduled to begin operations
during the second quarter of 2016 and will support Cimarex Energy Co. (NYSE: XEC) and
Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) in the Delaware Basin of West Texas.
·                  In June, the Partnership placed into service a 60-mile trunk line to the Partnership’s
Arapaho processing plant in Custer County, OK, to support Newfield Exploration’s (NYSE: NFX)
development of their STACK acreage in the Cana-Woodford Shale.
Capital Markets
·                  Year-to-date, the Partnership has issued 636,000 common units and received net
proceeds of $39.6 million.
·                  In May, the Partnership completed a public offering of $1.2 billion of 4.875% senior
unsecured notes due in 2025, and in June, the Partnership utilized proceeds from this transaction
along with draws from the Credit Facility to redeem its 6.75% Senior Notes due 2020, 6.5%
Senior Notes due 2021 and 6.25% Senior Notes due 2022.

FINANCIAL RESULTS
Balance Sheet
·                  As of June 30, 2015, the Partnership had $25.6 million of cash and cash equivalents in
wholly owned subsidiaries and $841.2 million of remaining capacity under its $1.3 billion Senior
Secured Credit Facility after consideration of $11.3 million of outstanding letters of credit and
$447.5 million of outstanding borrowings.
Operating Results
·                  Operating income before items not allocated to segments for the three months ended
June 30, 2015, was $239.6 million, an increase of $19.5 million when compared to $220.1 million
over the same period in 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to higher processing
volumes, partially offset by the decline in commodity pricing. Processed volumes continued to
increase in the second quarter of 2015, growing approximately 47 percent when compared to the
second quarter of 2014, primarily due to the Partnership’s Marcellus and Utica segments.
A reconciliation of operating income before items not allocated to segments to income before provision for income
tax, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is provided within the financial tables of this press
release.
·                  Operating income before items not allocated to segments does not include gains (losses)
on commodity derivative instruments. Realized gains (losses) on commodity derivative
instruments were $5.2 million in the second quarter of 2015 and ($1.9) million in the second
quarter of 2014.
Capital Expenditures
·                  For the three months ended June 30, 2015, the Partnership’s portion of capital
expenditures was $419.1 million.
2015 ADJUSTED EBITDA, DCF AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE FORECAST
For 2015, the Partnership’s Adjusted EBITDA forecast has been narrowed to a range of $925 million to $975 million
and DCF has been narrowed to a range of $700 million to $750 million based on its current forecast of operational
volumes and prices for natural gas liquids, crude oil, natural gas, and derivative instruments currently outstanding. A
sensitivity analysis for forecasted 2015 DCF based on changes in composite NGL prices and changes in volume
assumptions is provided within the tables of this press release.
The Partnership’s portion of growth capital expenditures for 2015 remains forecasted in a range of $1.5 billion to $1.9
billion. The Partnership’s forecasted maintenance capital for 2015 remains unchanged at approximately $30 million.

Distributable Cash Flow Sensitivity Analysis
(unaudited, in millions)
The Partnership periodically estimates the effect on DCF resulting from changes in its volume forecast and NGL
prices. The Partnership has become less sensitive to changes in commodity prices as a result of significant
increases in fee-based income. For the full-year 2015, the Partnership estimates that net operating margin will be
approximately 90 percent fee-based.
The analysis further assumes derivative instruments outstanding as of, and production volumes estimated through
December 31, 2015.

(1)         Volume Forecast is increased/decreased by 5% in the Marcellus and Utica segments for
the High and Low Cases.
(2)         The composition is based on the Partnership’s projected NGL barrel of approximately:
Ethane: 35%, Propane: 35%, Iso-Butane: 6%, Normal Butane: 12%, Natural Gasoline: 12%.
(3)         Composite NGL prices are based on the Partnership’s average forecasted price.
The table is based on current information, expectations, and beliefs concerning future developments and their
potential effects, and does not consider actions the Partnership’s management may take to mitigate exposure to
changes. Further, the table does not consider the effects that such hypothetical adverse changes may have on
overall economic activity. Historical volumes, prices and correlations do not guarantee future results.
Although the Partnership believes the expectations reflected in this analysis are reasonable, the Partnership can give
no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct and readers are cautioned that projected performance,
results, or distributions may not be achieved. Actual changes in market prices, market conditions and constraints,
production, NGL composition, infrastructure availability, market participants, and ratios between product prices may
differ from the assumptions utilized in the analysis. Actual results, performance, distributions, volumes, events, or
transactions could vary significantly from those expressed, considered or implied in this analysis. All results,
performance, distributions, volumes, events or transactions are subject to a number of uncertainties and risks. Those
uncertainties and risks may not be factored into or accounted for in this analysis. Readers are urged to carefully
review and consider the cautionary statements and disclosures made in the Partnership’s periodic reports filed with
the SEC, specifically those under the heading “Risk Factors.”
