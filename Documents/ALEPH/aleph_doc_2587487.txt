accounting terms used herein shall be interpreted, all determinations with respect to accounting matters
hereunder shall be made, and all financial statements and certificates and reports as to financial matters
required to be furnished to the Global Administrative Agent or the Lenders hereunder shall be prepared, in

which Borrower’s independent certified public accountants concur and which are disclosed in such
Financial Statements or to the Global Administrative Agent on the next date on which financial statements

notifies the Global Administrative Agent that the Borrower requests an amendment to any provision hereof
to eliminate the effect of any change occurring after the date hereof in GAAP or in the application thereof
on the operation of or calculation of compliance with such provision or (ii) the Global Administrative Agent

covenant or provision, the applicable amount of any currency (other than Dollars) shall be the Dollar
Equivalent of such currency as determined as of the most recent Revaluation Date. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Dollar Equivalent of any transaction determined for purposes of covenant compliance (e.g., the
principal amount of Indebtedness incurred, the amount of an Investment, the value of an asset) shall be
determined on the date such covenant compliance is determined and shall not be thereafter revalued.
ARTICLE 2
THE CREDITS
Section 2.01 Commitments. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Lender agrees to
make Loans to the Borrower during the Availability Period in an aggregate principal amount that will not
result in (i) such Lender’s Revolving Credit Exposure exceeding such Lender’s Commitment or (ii) the total
Revolving Credit Exposures exceeding the total Commitments. Within the foregoing limits and subject to
the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow the Loans.
Section 2.02 Loans and Borrowings. (a) Borrowings; Several Obligations. Each Loan shall be made as
part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective
Commitments. Any Swingline Loan shall be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 2.10. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any
other Lender of its obligations hereunder; provided that the Commitments are several and no Lender shall
be responsible for any other Lender’s failure to make Loans as required.
(b) Types of Loans. Subject to Section 3.03, each Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans or
Eurodollar Loans as the Borrower may request in accordance herewith. Each Swingline Borrowing shall
be comprised entirely of ABR Loans as the Borrower may request in accordance with Section 2.10. Each
Lender at its option may make any Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate
of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation
of the Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. No such designation
or transfer shall result in any liability on the part of the Borrower for increased costs or expenses resulting
solely from such designation or transfer (except any such transfer which is made by a Lender pursuant
43
to Section 5.04 or Section 5.05, or otherwise for the purpose of complying with any Governmental
Requirement). Increased costs for expenses resulting from a Change in Law occurring subsequent to any
such designation or transfer shall be deemed not to result solely from such designation or transfer.
(c) Minimum Amounts; Limitation on Number of Borrowings. Each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be in an
aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $3,000,000. Each ABR
Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $100,000 and not less than
$500,000; provided that an ABR Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire
unused balance of the total Commitments or that is required to finance the reimbursement of an LC
Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.08(e). Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding
at the same time; provided that there shall not at any time be more than a total of 10 Eurodollar Borrowings
outstanding. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Borrower shall not be entitled to
request, or to elect to convert or continue, any Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect
thereto would end after the Maturity Date.
(d) Notes. If requested by a Lender, the Loans made by such Lender shall be evidenced by a single
promissory note of the Borrower in substantially the form of Exhibit A, dated, in the case of (i) any Lender
party hereto as of the date of this Agreement, as of the Effective Date, and (ii) any other Lender, as of the
date such Lender becomes a party hereto, payable to such Lender in a principal amount equal to its
Maximum Credit Amount as in effect on such date, and otherwise duly completed. In the event that any
Lender’s Maximum Credit Amount increases or decreases for any reason (whether pursuant to
Section 2.06, Section 2.09, Section 12.04(b) or otherwise), the Borrower shall deliver or cause to be
delivered, to the extent such Lender is then holding a Note and upon the written request of such Lender,
on the effective date of such increase or decrease, a new Note payable to such Lender in a principal
amount equal to its Maximum Credit Amount after giving effect to such increase or decrease, and
otherwise duly completed. Upon receipt of such replacement Note, such Lender shall return the replaced
Note to the Borrower. The date, amount, Type, interest rate and, if applicable, Interest Period of each Loan
made by each Lender, and all payments made on account of the principal thereof, shall be recorded by
such Lender on its books for its Note, and, prior to any transfer, may be endorsed by such Lender on a
schedule attached to such Note or any continuation thereof or on any separate record maintained by such
Lender. Failure to make any such notation or to attach a schedule shall not affect any Lender’s or the
Borrower’s rights or obligations in respect of such Loans or affect the validity of such transfer by any
Lender of its Note.
Section 2.03 Requests for Borrowings. To request a Borrowing other than a Swingline Loan, the Borrower
shall notify the Global Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (a) in the case of a Eurodollar
Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, Chicago time, three Business Days before the date of the proposed
Borrowing or (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, Chicago time, on the date of
the proposed Borrowing; provided that no such notice shall be required for any deemed request of an ABR
Borrowing to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.08(e). Each such
telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery,
electronic mail or telecopy to the Global Administrative Agent of a written Borrowing Request substantially
in the form of Exhibit B and signed by the Borrower. Each such telephonic and written Borrowing Request
shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
(i) the aggregate amount of the requested Borrowing;
44
(ii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day;
(iii) whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing;
(iv) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, the initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be
a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”; and
(v) the location and number of the Borrower’s account to which funds are to be disbursed, which shall
comply with the requirements of Section 2.05.
If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified, then the requested Borrowing shall be an ABR
Borrowing. If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested Eurodollar Borrowing, then the
Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration. Each Borrowing
Request shall be deemed to constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrower that the matters
specified in Section 6.02(a) through (d) will be satisfied on the date of Borrowing specified in such
Borrowing Request.
Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section 2.03, the Global
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender’s
Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.
Section 2.04 Interest Elections. (a) Conversion and Continuance. Each Borrowing initially shall be of the
Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have
an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to
convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar
Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section 2.04. The Borrower may elect
different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such
portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and
the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. No such conversion or
continuation shall be deemed the making of a new Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement, including
without limitation ARTICLE 6.
(b) Interest Election Requests. To make an election pursuant to this Section 2.04, the Borrower shall notify
the Global Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would
be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from
such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election
Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery, electronic mail or telecopy
to the Global Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in substantially the form of Exhibit
C and signed by the Borrower.
45
(c) Information in Interest Election Requests. Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall
specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
(i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected
with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in
which case the information to be specified pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(iii) and (iv) shall be specified for
each resulting Borrowing);
(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a
Business Day;
(iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and
(iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after
giving effect to such election, which, subject to Section 2.04(e)(ii), shall be a period contemplated by the
definition of the term “Interest Period”.
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest
Period or the Interest Period specified in such Interest Election Request is not available to all Lenders,
then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration.
(d) Notice to Lenders by the Global Administrative Agent. Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election
Request, the Global Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such
Lender’s portion of each resulting Borrowing.
(e) Effect of Failure to Deliver Timely Interest Election Request and Events of Default and Borrowing Base
Deficiencies on Interest Election. If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with
respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless
such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be
converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if (i) an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing and the Global Administrative Agent, at the request of the Majority Lenders,
so notifies the Borrower: (A) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar
Borrowing (and any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or
continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective) and (B) unless repaid, each
Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable
thereto and (ii) a Borrowing Base Deficiency exists and the Global Administrative Agent, at the request of
the Majority Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued
as a Eurodollar Borrowing with an Interest Period longer than one month.
Section 2.05 Funding of Borrowings.
(a) Funding by Lenders. Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed
date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 1:00
46
p.m., Chicago time, to the account of the Global Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for
such purpose by notice to the Lenders; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in
Section 2.10. The Global Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by
promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower maintained with
the Global Administrative Agent and designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request;
provided that ABR Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in
Section 2.08(e) shall be remitted by the Global Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank that made such
LC Disbursement. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for its Loan
in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will
obtain the funds for its Loan in any particular place or manner.
(b) Presumption of Funding by the Lenders. Unless the Global Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date (or, with respect to an ABR Borrowing, 1:00 p.m. Chicago
time on the date) of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Global Administrative
Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Global Administrative Agent may assume that such
Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.05(a) and may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if
a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Global Administrative
Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Global Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and
including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to
the Global Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds
Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Global Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to
ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Global Administrative Agent, then such amount shall
constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing.
Section 2.06 Termination and Reduction of Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts. (a) Scheduled
Termination of Commitments. Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the
Maturity Date. If at any time the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts are terminated or reduced to zero,
then the Commitments shall terminate on the effective date of such termination or reduction.
(b) Optional Termination and Reduction of Aggregate Credit Amounts. (i) The Borrower may at any time
terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts; provided that (A) each
reduction of the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of
$1,000,000 and not less than $3,000,000 and (B) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Aggregate
Maximum Credit Amounts if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance
with Section 3.04(c), the total Revolving Credit Exposures would exceed the total Commitments.
(ii) The Borrower shall notify the Global Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the
Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts under Section 2.06(b)(i) at least three Business Days prior to the
effective date of such termination or reduction,
47
specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Global
Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the
Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.06(b)(ii) shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of
the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is
conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by
the Borrower (by notice to the Global Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such
condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts shall be
permanent and may not be reinstated. Each reduction of the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts shall be
made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with each Lender’s Applicable Percentage.
Section 2.07 Borrowing Base. (a) Initial Borrowing Base. For the period from and including the Effective
Date to but excluding the first Redetermination Date occurring after the Effective Date, the amount of the
Global Borrowing Base shall be $1,075,000,000 and the amount of the U.S. Borrowing Base shall be
$850,000,000. Until reallocated in accordance with the Section 2.07 or 3.04 or otherwise required to be
reduced hereunder, the Allocated U.S. Borrowing Base shall be $775,000,000 and the Allocated
Canadian Borrowing Base shall be $300,000,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Global Borrowing
Base and U.S. Borrowing Base may be subject to further adjustments from time to time, whether before or
after such Redetermination Date, pursuant to Section 8.12(c), Section 9.02(n) or Section 9.10.
(b) Scheduled and Interim Redeterminations. Subject to Section 2.07(d), the Global Borrowing Base and
the U.S. Borrowing Base shall be redetermined semi-annually (a “Scheduled Redetermination”) on or
about the date that is 45 days following the Borrower’s delivery of the U.S. Reserve Report and Canadian
Reserve Report in accordance with Section 8.11(a). In addition, (i) the Borrower may, by notifying the
Global Administrative Agent thereof, and (ii) the Global Administrative Agent may, or shall at the direction
of the Required Lenders or the Required U.S. Lenders, by notifying the Borrower thereof, each elect to
cause the Global Borrowing Base or U.S. Borrowing Base to be redetermined one time between
Scheduled Redeterminations (an “Interim Redetermination”) in accordance with this Section 2.07.
(c) Scheduled and Interim Redetermination Procedure. (i) Each Scheduled Redetermination and each
Interim Redetermination shall be effectuated as follows: Upon receipt by the Global Administrative Agent
of (A) the U.S. Reserve Report, the Canadian Reserve Report and the certificate required to be delivered
by the Borrower to the Global Administrative Agent, in the case of a Scheduled Redetermination, pursuant
to Section 8.11(a) and (c), and, in the case of an Interim Redetermination, pursuant to Section 8.11(b) and
(c), and (B) such other reports, data and supplemental information including, without limitation, the
information provided pursuant to Section 8.11(c) as may, from time to time, be reasonably requested by the
Required Lenders (the Reserve Reports, such certificate and such other reports, data and supplemental
information being the “Engineering Reports”), the Global Administrative Agent shall evaluate the
information contained in the Engineering Reports and shall propose a new Global Borrowing Base and a
new U.S. Borrowing Base (the “Proposed Global Borrowing Base” and the “Proposed U.S. Borrowing
Base”, respectively) based upon such information and such other information that is deemed appropriate
by the Global Administrative Agent in its sole discretion in good faith and consistent with its normal oil and
gas lending criteria as it exists at
48
the particular time (including, without limitation, the status of title information with respect to the Oil and
Gas Properties as described in the Engineering Reports and the existence of any other Debt, the
Borrower’s and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ other assets, liabilities, fixed charges, cash flow, business,
properties, prospects, management and ownership, hedged and unhedged exposure to price, price and
production scenarios, interest rate and operating cost changes). In no event shall the Proposed Global
Borrowing Base exceed the Combined Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts or the Proposed U.S.
Borrowing Base exceed the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts.
(ii) The Global Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower, QRCI and the Lenders of the Proposed
Global Borrowing Base and the Proposed U.S. Borrowing Base (the “Proposed Borrowing Base Notice”):
(A) in the case of a Scheduled Redetermination (1) if the Global Administrative Agent shall have received
the Engineering Reports required to be delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Section 8.11(a) in a timely
and complete manner, then on or before 30 days after the receipt of such Engineering Reports (or as
promptly thereafter as may be reasonably practicable) or (2) if the Global Administrative Agent shall not
have received the Engineering Reports required to be delivered by the Borrower pursuant to
Section 8.11(a) in a timely and complete manner, then promptly after the Global Administrative Agent has
received complete Engineering Reports from the Borrower and has had a reasonable opportunity to
determine the Proposed Global Borrowing Base in accordance with Section 2.07(c)(i); and
(B) in the case of an Interim Redetermination, promptly, and in any event, within 30 days after the Global
Administrative Agent has received the required Engineering Reports (or as promptly thereafter as may be
reasonably practicable).
(iii) Any Proposed Global Borrowing Base that would increase the Global Borrowing Base then in effect
must be approved or deemed to have been approved by the Super-majority Lenders as provided in this
Section 2.07(c)(iii); and any Proposed Global Borrowing Base that would decrease or maintain the Global
Borrowing Base then in effect must be approved or be deemed to have been approved by the Required
Lenders as provided in this Section 2.07(c)(iii). Any Proposed U.S. Borrowing Base that would increase
the U.S. Borrowing Base then in effect must be approved or deemed to have been approved by the Super-
majority U.S. Lenders as provided in this Section 2.07(c)(iii); and any Proposed U.S. Borrowing Base that
would decrease or maintain the U.S. Borrowing Base then in effect must be approved or be deemed to
have been approved by the Required U.S. Lenders as provided in this Section 2.07(c)(iii). Upon receipt of
the Proposed Borrowing Base Notice, each Lender and Canadian Lender shall have 15 days to agree
with the Proposed Global Borrowing Base and/or the Proposed U.S. Borrowing Base or disagree with the
Proposed Global Borrowing Base and/or the Proposed U.S. Borrowing Base by proposing an alternate
Global Borrowing Base and/or U.S. Borrowing Base. If, at the end of such 15 days, any Lender or
Canadian Lender has not communicated its approval or disapproval in writing to the Global Administrative
49
Agent, such silence shall be deemed to be an approval of the Proposed Global Borrowing Base and, if
applicable, the U.S. Borrowing Base. If, at the end of such 15-day period: (1) the Super-majority Lenders,
in the case of a Proposed Global Borrowing Base that would increase the Global Borrowing Base then in
effect, (2) the Super-majority U.S. Lenders, in the case of a Proposed U.S. Borrowing Base that would
increase the U.S. Borrowing Base then in effect, (3) the Required Lenders, in the case of a Proposed
Global Borrowing Base that would decrease or maintain the Global Borrowing Base or (4) the Required
U.S. Lenders, in the case of a Proposed U.S. Borrowing Base that would decrease or maintain the U.S.
Borrowing Base then in effect, have approved or deemed to have approved, as aforesaid, then the
Proposed Global Borrowing Base shall become the new Global Borrowing Base effective on the date
specified in Section 2.07(d) and/or the Proposed U.S. Borrowing Base shall become the new U.S.
Borrowing Base effective on the date specified in Section 2.07(d). If, however, at the end of such 15-day
period, the Required Lenders, the Required U.S. Lenders, the Super-majority Lenders or the Super-
majority U.S. Lenders have not approved or deemed to have approved, as aforesaid, then the Global
Administrative Agent shall poll the Lenders and the Canadian Lenders to ascertain the highest (x) Global
Borrowing Base then acceptable to a number of Lenders and Canadian Lenders sufficient to constitute the
Required Lenders or the Super-majority Lenders, as applicable, and such amount shall become the new
Global Borrowing Base, effective on the date specified in Section 2.07(d) and/or (y) U.S. Borrowing Base
then acceptable to a number of Lenders sufficient to constitute the Required U.S. Lenders or the Super-
majority U.S. Lenders, as applicable, and such amount shall become the new U.S. Borrowing Base,
effective on the date specified in Section 2.07(d). The consent of the Borrower, in its sole discretion, shall
be required for any increase in the Global Borrowing Base or the U.S. Borrowing Base.
(d) Effectiveness of a Redetermined Borrowing Base. After a redetermined Global Borrowing Base or U.S.
Borrowing Base is approved or is deemed to have been approved by the Required Lenders, the Required
U.S. Lenders, the Super-majority Lenders or the Super-majority U.S. Lenders, as applicable, pursuant to
Section 2.07(c)(iii) (and, in the case of an increase, the Borrower), the Global Administrative Agent shall
notify the Borrower, QRCI, the Lenders and the Canadian Lenders of the amount of the redetermined
Global Borrowing Base and the U.S. Borrowing Base (the “New Borrowing Base Notice”), and such
amounts shall become the new Global Borrowing Base and U.S. Borrowing Base, effective and applicable
to the Borrower, the Agents, each Issuing Bank and the Lenders:
(i) in the case of a Scheduled Redetermination, (A) if the Global Administrative Agent shall have received
the Engineering Reports required to be delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Section 8.11(a) and (c) in a
timely and complete manner, then on the date of such New Borrowing Base Notice, or (B) if the Global
Administrative Agent shall not have received the Engineering Reports required to be delivered by the
Borrower pursuant to Section 8.11(a) and (c) in a timely and complete manner, then on the Business Day
next succeeding the date of such New Borrowing Base Notice; and
(ii) in the case of an Interim Redetermination, on the Business Day next succeeding the date of such New
Borrowing Base Notice.
50
Such amounts shall then become the Global Borrowing Base and the U.S. Borrowing Base, as applicable,
until the next Scheduled Redetermination Date, the next Interim Redetermination Date or the next
adjustment to the Global Borrowing Base and/or the U.S. Borrowing Base under Section 8.12 (c),
Section 9.02(n) or Section 9.10, whichever occurs first. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Scheduled
Redetermination or Interim Redetermination shall become effective until the New Borrowing Base Notice
related thereto is received by the Borrower.
(e) Allocation of the U.S. Borrowing Base. For so long as any of the Combined Commitments are in effect
and/or any Combined Obligations are outstanding, a portion of the U.S. Borrowing Base may be allocated
to support the availability of Canadian Revolving Credit Exposure in accordance with this Section 2.07(e).
(i) Within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of a New Borrowing Base Notice, the Borrower shall specify
the amount of U.S. Borrowing Base to be allocated to support the availability of Canadian Revolving
Credit Exposure by providing a written notice to the Global Administrative Agent and the Canadian
Administrative Agent of such allocation (each such notice herein a “Borrowing Base Allocation Notice”);
provided that at no time shall (x) the Allocated U.S. Borrowing Base be an amount less than $50,000,000
(such minimum amount in respect of the Allocated U.S. Borrowing Base then in effect, the “Minimum
Allocated U.S. Borrowing Base”) or (y) the Allocated Canadian Borrowing Base (after giving effect to such
allocation) exceed the Canadian Aggregate Maximum Credit Amount. In the event that the Borrower fails
to provide the Global Administrative Agent with a Borrowing Base Allocation Notice required to be
delivered upon receipt of a New Borrowing Base Notice within such ten (10) Business Day period, the
U.S. Borrowing Base will be allocated in the same amount as existed prior to such redetermination.
Promptly upon the allocation of the U.S. Borrowing Base, the Global Administrative Agent shall provide a
written notice to the Combined Lenders. Any designation of the Allocated U.S. Borrowing Base or the
Allocated Canadian Borrowing Base effected pursuant to this Section 2.07(e)(i) in connection with a
determination or redetermination of the Global Borrowing Base or U.S. Borrowing Base, shall be effective
as of the date of the New Borrowing Base Notice.
(ii) So long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, from time to time but
in no event more than (A) four (4) times per fiscal year and (B) once every thirty (30) days, upon at least
five (5) Business Days prior written notice to the Global Administrative Agent (the “Discretionary Borrowing
Base Allocation Notice”), the Borrower may reallocate the U.S. Borrowing Base between the Allocated
U.S. Borrowing Base and the Allocated Canadian Borrowing Base (a “Discretionary Borrowing Base
Reallocation”). Promptly upon the allocation of the U.S. Borrowing Base between the Allocated U.S.
Borrowing Base and the Allocated Canadian Borrowing Base in accordance with the procedures set forth
in this clause (ii), the Global Administrative Agent shall provide a written notice thereof to the Combined
Lenders. Any Discretionary Borrowing Base Reallocation shall (1) be effective five (5) Business Days
following the date the Global Administrative Agent receives the Discretionary Borrowing Base Allocation
Notice or the date indicated for such effectiveness in the Discretionary Borrowing Base Allocation Notice,
whichever is later and (2) be subject to
51
(x) the Minimum Allocated U.S. Borrowing Base and (y) the Allocated Canadian Borrowing Base (after
giving effect to such allocation) not exceeding the Canadian Aggregate Maximum Credit Amount.
(iii) In connection with each Borrowing Base Allocation Notice or Discretionary Borrowing Base Allocation
Notice, the Global Administrative Agent shall calculate the Applicable Percentage of each Lender and
provide notice to each Lender of its Applicable Percentage. On each date on which an allocation of the
U.S. Borrowing Base pursuant to a Borrowing Base Allocation Notice or a Discretionary Borrowing Base
Allocation Notice which results in a change in the Applicable Percentage of any Lender becomes
effective, if any Loans or Letters of Credit are outstanding as of such date, then the outstanding principal
balance of the Loans (and participations in Letters of Credit) shall be reallocated in accordance with such
new Applicable Percentages and each Lender whose Applicable Percentage has increased shall, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, purchase a pro rata portion of the outstanding Loans (and
participation interests in Letters of Credit) of each Lender who Applicable Percentage has decreased (and
such Lenders hereby agree to sell and to take all such further action to effectuate such sale) such that
each Lender shall hold its new Applicable Percentage of the outstanding Loans (and participation
interests) after giving effect to such purchases and sales.
Section 2.08 Letters of Credit.
(a) General. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may request any Issuing
Bank to issue Canadian Dollar or Dollar denominated Letters of Credit for its own account or for the
account of any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Global Administrative
Agent and such Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time during the Availability Period; provided,
however, that no Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended if, after such issuance or
at the time of any such amendment, renewal or extension, (i) the LC Exposure would exceed the LC
Commitment and (ii) the total Revolving Credit Exposure would exceed the total Commitments of all
Lenders. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the
Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, an Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms
and conditions of this Agreement shall control.
(b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions. To request the issuance of a
Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrower
shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have
been approved by the applicable Issuing Bank) to any Issuing Bank and the Global Administrative Agent
(not less than three Business Days in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension) a notice:
(i) requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit or identifying the Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing
Bank to be amended, renewed or extended;
52
(ii) specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day);
(iii) specifying the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with
Section 2.08(c));
(iv) specifying the amount and Currency of such Letter of Credit; and
(v) specifying the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be
necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit.
Each such notice shall be deemed to constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrower that the
matters specified in Section 6.02(a) through (d) will be satisfied on the date specified in clause (ii) of the
immediately preceding sentence and that the terms of the proviso in Section 2.08(a) shall be satisfied. No
letter of credit issued by an Issuing Bank (if the Issuing Bank is not the Global Administrative Agent) shall
be deemed to be a “Letter of Credit” issued under this Agreement unless such Issuing Bank has confirmed
with the Global Administrative Agent that the condition set forth in Section 6.02(d) hereof is satisfied and
that the LC Exposure does not exceed the LC Commitment (after giving effect to the issuance of such letter
of credit). If requested by any Issuing Bank, the Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on
such Issuing Bank’s standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit.
(c) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of
(i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or
extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days
prior to the Maturity Date; provided, however, that any Letter of Credit with a one-year tenor may provide for
the renewal thereof for additional one-year periods (which shall in no event extend beyond the date
referred to in clause (ii) above).
(d) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing
the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank that issues such Letter of
Credit or the Lenders, each Issuing Bank that issues a Letter of Credit hereunder hereby grants to each
Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit
equal to such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such
Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and
unconditionally agrees to pay to the Global Administrative Agent, in the Currency in which such Letter of
Credit is denominated, for the account of any Issuing Bank that issues a Letter of Credit hereunder, such
Lender’s Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank and not
reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in Section 2.08(e), or of any reimbursement
payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees
that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this Section 2.08(d) in respect of Letters of Credit is
absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any
amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default,
the existence of a Borrowing Base Deficiency or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that
each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
53
(e) Reimbursement. If any Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit
issued by such Issuing Bank, the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Global
Administrative Agent an amount (in the Currency in which the applicable Letter of Credit is denominated)
equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 1:00 p.m., Chicago time, on the date that such LC
Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00
a.m., Chicago time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by the Borrower prior to such
time on such date, then not later than 1:00 p.m., Chicago time, on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower
receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., Chicago time, on the day of receipt, or
(ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice
is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; provided that the Borrower may request that such
payment be financed with an ABR Borrowing in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the
Borrower’s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR
Borrowing. For purposes of the first sentence of Section 2.01, the amount of such ABR Borrowing shall be
considered, but the amount of the LC Disbursement to be concurrently reimbursed shall not be considered.
If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Global Administrative Agent shall notify each
Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and
such Lender’s Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall
pay to the Global Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the
Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.05 with respect to Loans made by such Lender
(and Section 2.05 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Global
Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank that issued such Letter of Credit the amounts
so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Global Administrative Agent of any
payment from the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.08(e), the Global Administrative Agent shall
distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank that issued such Letter of Credit or, to the extent that Lenders
have made payments pursuant to this Section 2.08(e) to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such
Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to
this Section 2.08(e) to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR
Loans as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its
obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.
(f) Obligations Absolute. The Borrower’s obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in
Section 2.08(e) shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective
of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit, any Letter of Credit Agreement or this
Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of
Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by any Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing
Bank against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of
Credit or any Letter of Credit Agreement, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or
not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of
54
this Section 2.08(f), constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the
Borrower’s obligations hereunder. Neither the Global Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor any Issuing
Bank, nor any of their Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection
with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment
thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error,
omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication
under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder),
any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of
any Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any Issuing Bank from
liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims
in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered
by the Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Bank’s failure to exercise care when determining whether
drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties
hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of any
Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be
deemed to have exercised all requisite care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing
and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented
which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing
Bank that issued such Letter of Credit may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon
such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to
the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in
strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
(g) Disbursement Procedures. Each Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all
documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing
Bank. Such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Global Administrative Agent and the Borrower by
telephone (confirmed by electronic mail or telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether such
Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or
delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank
and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
(h) Interim Interest. If any Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, until the Borrower shall
have reimbursed such Issuing Bank for such LC Disbursement (either with its own funds or a Borrowing
under Section 2.08(e)), the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the
date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC
Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Loans. Interest accrued pursuant to this
Section 2.08(h) shall be for the account of such Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the
date of payment by any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08(e) to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the
account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.
(i) Replacement of an Issuing Bank. Any Issuing Bank may be replaced or resign at any time by written
agreement among the Borrower, the Global Administrative Agent, such retiring or replaced Issuing Bank
and, in the case of a replacement, the successor Issuing Bank.
55
The Global Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such resignation or replacement of an
Issuing Bank. At the time any such resignation or replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall
pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the retiring or replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to
Section 3.05(b). In the case of the replacement of an Issuing Bank, from and after the effective date of such
replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the replaced
Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and
(ii) references herein to “Issuing Bank” shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous
Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the
resignation or replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the retiring or replaced Issuing Bank shall
remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under
this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such resignation or replacement, but
shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.
(j) Cash Collateralization. If (i) any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing and the Borrower
receives notice from the Global Administrative Agent or the Majority U.S. Lenders demanding the deposit
of cash collateral pursuant to this Section 2.08(j), (ii) the Borrower is required to pay to the Global
Administrative Agent the excess attributable to an LC Exposure in connection with any prepayment
pursuant to Section 3.04(c) or (iii) the Borrower receives notice from the Global Administrative Agent that
the LC Exposure exceeds 105% of the LC Commitment, then the Borrower shall deposit, as of the date of
such notice or required payment or, in the case of clause (z) below, within three Business Days of the
Borrower’s receipt of notice from the Global Administrative Agent, in an account with the Global
Administrative Agent, in the name of the Global Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an
amount in cash (in the applicable Currency) equal to, (x) in the case of an Event of Default, the LC
Exposure, (y) in the case of a payment required by Section 3.04(c), the amount of such excess as provided
in Section 3.04(c), or (z) in the case of the LC Exposure exceeding the LC Commitment due to fluctuations
in the exchange rate between the Dollar and the Canadian Dollar, the excess of the LC Exposure over the
LC Commitment, in each case, plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation
to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become
immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any
Event of Default with respect to the Borrower or any Guarantor described in Section 10.01(h) or
Section 10.01(i). The Borrower hereby grants to the Global Administrative Agent, for the benefit of each
Issuing Bank and the Lenders, an exclusive first priority and continuing perfected security interest in and
Lien on such account and all cash, checks, drafts, certificates and instruments, if any, from time to time
deposited or held in such account, all deposits or wire transfers made thereto, any and all investments
purchased with funds deposited in such account, all interest, dividends, cash, instruments, financial assets
and other Property from time to time received, receivable or otherwise payable in respect of, or in
exchange for, any or all of the foregoing, and all proceeds, products, accessions, rents, profits, income and
benefits therefrom, and any substitutions and replacements therefor. The Borrower’s obligation to deposit
amounts pursuant to this Section 2.08(j) shall be absolute and unconditional, without regard to whether
any beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit has attempted to draw down all or a portion of such amount
under the terms of a Letter of Credit, and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, shall not be
subject to any defense or be affected by a right of set-off, counterclaim or recoupment which the Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries may now or hereafter have against any such beneficiary, any Issuing
56
Bank, the Global Administrative Agent, the Lenders or any other Person for any reason whatsoever. Such
deposit shall be held as collateral securing the payment and performance of the Borrower’s and the
Guarantor’s obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. The Global Administrative
Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such
account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be
made at the option and sole discretion of the Global Administrative Agent and at the Borrower’s risk and
expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall
accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Global Administrative Agent
to reimburse, on a pro rata basis, each Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been
reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement
obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been
accelerated, be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrower and the Guarantors under this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents. In the event of any such payment by the Borrower of amounts
contingently owing under outstanding Letters of Credit and in the event that thereafter drafts or other
demands for payment complying with the terms of such Letters of Credit are not made on or prior to the
respective expiration dates thereof, the Global Administrative Agent agrees, if no Default is then continuing
and the Borrower does not have any obligation at such time to provide cash collateral under Section 2.11
hereof, or if no other amounts are then outstanding under this Agreement, the Notes or the Loan
Documents, to remit to the Borrower amounts for which the contingent obligations evidenced by the Letters
of Credit have ceased (but only to the extent of the amount of cash collateral then on deposit with the
Global Administrative Agent in respect of such Letters of Credit). If the Borrower is required to provide an
amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, and the Borrower
is not otherwise required to pay to the Global Administrative Agent the excess attributable to an LC
Exposure in connection with any prepayment pursuant to Section 3.04(c) or clause (z) of this
Section 2.08(j), then such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower
within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived. If the Borrower was
(1) required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the LC Exposure exceeding
the LC Commitment due to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Dollar and the Canadian Dollar,
(2) the LC Exposure no longer exceeds the LC Commitment and (3) and the Borrower is not otherwise
required to post cash collateral in respect of the Letters of Credit hereunder which has not been posted,
then the amount of such excess shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days upon
request of the Borrower.
Section 2.09 Increase in the Maximum Credit Amounts. (a) The Borrower may, with the consent of the
Global Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), on
no more than five occasions during the period beginning on the Effective Date to and including the date
that is six months prior to the Maturity Date, by written notice to the Global Administrative Agent executed
by the Borrower and one or more financial institutions (any such financial institution executing such notice
being called an “Increasing Lender”), which may include any Lender, cause the Maximum Credit Amounts
to be extended by the Increasing Lenders if such Increasing Lender is not already a Lender (or cause the
Maximum Credit Amounts of the Increasing Lenders that are already Lenders to be increased, as the case
may be) in an amount for each Increasing Lender set forth in such notice; provided, that (i) each extension
of new Maximum Credit Amounts or increase in existing Maximum Credit
57
Amounts pursuant to this paragraph shall result in the aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts being
increased by no less than $17,500,000, (ii) the sum of all new Maximum Credit Amounts and increases in
existing Maximum Credit Amounts pursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed $250,000,000 without the
approval of all Lenders, (iii) each Increasing Lender, if not already a Lender, shall be subject to the
approval of the Global Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (iv) each Increasing Lender, if not already a
Lender hereunder, shall become a party to this Agreement by completing and delivering to the Global
Administrative Agent a duly executed joinder agreement in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Global
Administrative Agent and the Borrower (a “Joinder Agreement”), (v) any Lender requested by the Borrower
to become an Increasing Lender may elect, or decline, such request in its sole discretion and (vi) no
Default has occurred and is continuing.
(b) Upon the effectiveness of any Joinder Agreement to which any Increasing Lender is a party, (i) such
Increasing Lender shall thereafter be deemed to be a party to this Agreement and shall be entitled to all
rights, benefits and privileges accorded a Lender hereunder and subject to all obligations of a Lender
hereunder and (ii) Annex I shall be deemed to have been amended to reflect the Maximum Credit Amount
of such Increasing Lender as provided in such Joinder Agreement. Upon the effectiveness of any increase
pursuant to this Section 2.09 in the Maximum Credit Amount of a Lender already a party hereto, Annex I
shall be deemed to have been amended to reflect the increased Maximum Credit Amount of such Lender.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts (or in the Maximum
Credit Amount of any Lender) shall become effective under this Section unless, on the date of such
increase, the Global Administrative Agent shall have received (1) a certificate, dated as of the effective
date of such increase and executed by a Financial Officer of the Borrower, to the effect that the conditions
set forth in paragraphs (a) and (c) of Section 6.02 shall be satisfied (with all references in such paragraphs
to a Borrowing being deemed to be references to such increase and attaching resolutions of the Borrower
approving such increase) and (2) if requested by the Global Administrative Agent, a legal opinion in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Global Administrative Agent. The Global Administrative
Agent shall provide notice to the Borrower and the Lenders of the effectiveness of any such Joinder
Agreement and/or any increase in the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts (or in the Maximum Credit
Amount of any Lender) and the foregoing shall be effective as of the date of such notice.
(c) The Borrower shall prepay any Loans outstanding prior to the effectiveness of such increase or
extension, together with any amounts due pursuant to Section 5.02, with new Loans made pursuant to
Section 2.01 ratably in accordance with the Maximum Credit Amounts in effect following such extension or
increase.
Section 2.10 Swingline Loans. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swingline Lender
agrees to make a portion of the credit otherwise available to the Borrower under the Commitments from
time to time until the Termination Date by making swing line loans (“Swingline Loans”) to the Borrower;
provided that (i) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Swingline Loans owed to the Swingline
Lender at any time shall not exceed its Swingline Commitment then in effect (notwithstanding that the
outstanding Swingline Loans owed to the Swingline Lender at any time, when aggregated with the
Swingline Lender’s other outstanding Loans, may exceed its Commitment then in effect) and (ii) the
Borrower shall not
58
request, and the Swingline Lender shall not make, any Swingline Loan if, after giving effect to the making
of such Swingline Loan, the Revolving Credit Exposure would exceed the lower of (A) the total
Commitments of all Lenders and (B) the Allocated U.S. Borrowing Base; provided further that the
Swingline Lender may not make a Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Loan. Prior to
the Termination Date, the Borrower may use the Swingline Commitment by borrowing, repaying (in whole
or part) and reborrowing, all in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof.
(b) The Borrower shall repay to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline
Loan made by the Swingline Lender on or before the earlier of (i) the Termination Date and (ii) the first
date after such Swingline Loan is made that is the 15th or last day of a calendar month and is at least five
(5) Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made. The unpaid principal amount of each Swingline
Loan shall bear interest at the per annum rate equal to Alternate Base Rate in effect from time to time plus
the Applicable Margin for ABR Loans.
(c) The obligation of the Swingline Lender to make Swingline Loans to the Borrower is subject to the same
conditions precedent for the making of Loans under Section 6.02.
(d) Whenever the Borrower desires that the Swingline Lender make Swingline Loans it shall give
irrevocable telephonic notice to JPMorgan, as Global Administrative Agent and the Swingline Lender,
confirmed promptly in writing (which telephonic notice must be received by the Swingline Lender not later
than 1:30 p.m., Chicago time, on the proposed date Swingline Loans are requested to be made),
specifying (i) the amount to be borrowed and (ii) the requested date such Swingline Loans are to be
advanced (which shall be a Business Day). Each borrowing under the Swingline Commitment shall be in
an amount not less than $500,000 and a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. As soon as such
funds are available, but in any event not later than 3:00 p.m., Chicago time, on the date such Swingline
Loans are requested to be advanced pursuant to the Borrower’s corresponding written request referenced
above, the Swingline Lender shall make available to the Global Administrative Agent at the office
designated by the Global Administrative Agent for such purpose an amount in immediately available funds
equal to the amount of the Swingline Loans to be made by the Swingline Lender. The Global
Administrative Agent shall make the proceeds of such Swingline Loan available to the Borrower at such
office in immediately available funds as soon as such funds are available, but in any event not later than
3:00 p.m., Chicago time, on the date such Swingline Loans are requested to be advanced pursuant to the
Borrower’s corresponding written request.
(e) The Swingline Lender, at any time and from time to time in its sole and absolute discretion may, on
behalf of the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swingline Lender to so act on its behalf),
by written notice to the Global Administrative Agent and each Lender, with copy to the Borrower, given by
the Swingline Lender no later than 11:00 a.m., Chicago time, require each Lender to make, and each
Lender hereby agrees to make, a Loan, in an amount equal to such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the
aggregate amount of the Swingline Lender’s Swingline Loans (the “Refunded Swingline Loans”)
outstanding on the date of such notice, to repay the Swingline Lender. Each Lender shall make the
amount of such Loan available to the Global Administrative Agent at such office in immediately available
funds, not later than 10:00 a.m., Chicago time, one Business Day after the date of such notice. The
proceeds of such Loans shall be immediately made available by the Global Administrative Agent to the
Swingline Lender for application by it to the repayment of the Refunded Swingline Loans.
59
(f) If prior to the time a Refunded Swingline Loan would have otherwise been made pursuant to
Section 2.10(e), one of the events described in Section 10.01(h) or Section 10.01(i) shall have occurred
and be continuing with respect to the Borrower or if for any other reason, as determined by the Swingline
Lender in its sole discretion, Loans may not be made as contemplated by Section 2.10(e), each Lender
shall, on the date such Loan was to have been made pursuant to the notice referred to in Section 2.10(e),
purchase for cash an undivided participating interest in the then outstanding Swingline Loans by paying to
the Swingline Lender an amount (the “Swingline Participation Amount”) equal to (i) such Lender’s
Applicable Percentage times (ii) the sum of the aggregate principal amount of Swingline Loans then
outstanding to the Swingline Lender that were to have been repaid with such Loans.
(g) Whenever, at any time after the Swingline Lender has received from any Lender such Lender’s
Swingline Participation Amount, the Swingline Lender receives any payment on account of outstanding
Swingline Loans, the Swingline Lender will distribute to such Lender its Swingline Participation Amount
(appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such
Lender’s participating interest was outstanding and funded and, in the case of principal and interest
payments, to reflect such Lender’s pro rata portion of such payment if such payment is not sufficient to pay
the principal of and interest on all Swingline Loans then due); provided, however, that in the event that
such payment received by the Swingline Lender is required to be returned, such Lender will return to the
Swingline Lender any portion thereof previously distributed to it by the Swingline Lender.
(h) Each Lender’s obligation to make the Loans referred to in Section 2.10(e) and to purchase participating
interests pursuant to Section 2.10(f) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such Lender or
the Borrower may have against the Swingline Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason
whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the
other conditions specified in Section 6.02, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise)
of the Borrower, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Borrower, any
Guarantor or any other Lender or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or
not similar to any of the foregoing.
Section 2.11 Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any
Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender
is a Defaulting Lender:
(a) Commitment fees will cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of the Defaulting
Lender pursuant to Section 3.05(a) and such Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to receive any
commitment fee pursuant to Section 3.05(a);
60
(b) If any Swingline Loans are outstanding or any LC Exposure exists at the time a Lender is a Defaulting
Lender then solely for purposes of computing the amount of the obligation of each non-Defaulting Lender
to acquire, refinance or fund participations in Swingline Loans and Letters of Credit pursuant to
Section 2.08 and Section 2.10:
(i) all or any part of the Swingline Participation Amount and LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall
be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable
Percentages but only to the extent that (x) the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders’ Revolving Credit
Exposures does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders’ Commitments, (y) each non-Defaulting
Lender’s total Revolving Credit Exposure may not in any event exceed the Commitment of such Non-
Defaulting Lender as in effect at the time of such reallocation and (z) the conditions set forth in
Section 6.02 are satisfied at such time;
(ii) if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower
shall within three Business Days following notice by the Global Administrative Agent given no later than
12:00 noon, Chicago time (x) first, prepay the Swingline Participation Amount of the Defaulting Lender to
the Swingline Lender and (y) second, cash collateralize such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure (after
giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set
forth in Section 2.08(j) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;
(iii) if the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure pursuant to
this Section 2.11(b), the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant
to Section 3.05(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting
Lender’s LC Exposure is cash collateralized; if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is
reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.11, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 3.05(a)
and Section 3.05(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders’ Applicable
Percentages with the balance of such fee, if any, being retained by the Borrower for its own account or, to
the extent any LC Exposure shall then be outstanding, being payable to each applicable Issuing Bank for
its own account to the extent such fee relates to the amount of such LC Exposure; or
(iv) if any Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure is neither cash collateralized nor reallocated pursuant to this
Section 2.11, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Issuing Bank or any Lender
hereunder, all commitment fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender (solely
with respect to the portion of such Defaulting Lender’s Commitment that was utilized by such LC
Exposure) and Letter of Credit fees payable under Section 3.05(b) with respect to such Defaulting
Lender’s LC Exposure shall be payable to each applicable Issuing Bank until such LC Exposure is cash
collateralized and/or reallocated.
(c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, so long as any Lender is a Defaulting
Lender, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and no Issuing Bank shall
be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that the related exposure
will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be
provided by the Borrower in accordance
61
with Section 2.08(j), and participating interests in any such newly issued or increased Letter of Credit or
newly made Swingline Loan shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent
with Section 2.11(b)(i) (and Defaulting Lenders shall not participate therein).
(d) Any amount payable to such Defaulting Lender hereunder (whether on account of principal, interest,
fees or otherwise and including any amount that would otherwise be payable to such Defaulting Lender
pursuant to Section 4.01(c) or Section 10.02(c), but excluding Section 5.04(b)) will, in lieu of being
distributed to such Defaulting Lender, be retained by the Global Administrative Agent in a segregated
account and, subject to any applicable requirements of law, be applied at such time or times as may be
determined by the Global Administrative Agent (i) first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such
Defaulting Lender to the Global Administrative Agent hereunder, (ii) second, pro rata, to the payment of
any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to each Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender hereunder,
(iii) third, to cash collateralize such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure in accordance with Section 2.08(j),
(iv) fourth, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default exists), to the funding of any Loan or
Swingline Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as
required by this Agreement, as determined by the Global Administrative Agent, (v) fifth, if so determined by
the Global Administrative Agent and the Borrower, held in an interest bearing account and released pro
rata in order to (A) satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations with respect to
Loans under this Agreement and (B) cash collateralize such Defaulting Lender’s future LC Exposure in
accordance with Section 2.08(j), (vi) sixth, to the payment of any amounts then owing to the Lenders, any
Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender as a result of any final and non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender against such Defaulting
Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement,
(vii) seventh, to the payment of any amounts then owing to the Borrower as a result of any final and non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting
Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement and
(viii) eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction;
provided that if such payment is (x) a prepayment of the principal amount of any Loans or reimbursement
obligations in respect of LC Disbursement or Swingline Participation Amount that a Defaulting Lender has
not fully funded its participation obligations and (y) in the case of such Loans which were made at a time
when the conditions set forth in Section 6.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment will be applied solely
to prepay the Loans of, and reimbursement obligations owed to, all non-Defaulting Lenders pro rata prior
to being applied to the prepayment of any Loans, or reimbursement obligations owed to, any Defaulting
Lender. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to any Defaulting Lender that are
applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by such Defaulting Lender or to post cash collateral pursuant to
Section 2.11 shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender
irrevocably consents to the foregoing.
(e) If any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice
to such Lender and the Global Administrative Agent, require such Lender to be replaced in accordance
with Section 5.04(b).
(f) In the event that the Global Administrative Agent, the Borrower, the Issuing Banks and the Swingline
Lender each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied
62
all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Participation Amounts
and LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Defaulting Lender’s
Commitment and on such date such Defaulting Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other
Lenders (other than Swingline Loans) as the Global Administrative Agent shall determine may be
necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage;
provided, that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by
or on behalf of the Borrower while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except
to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting
Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim that the Borrower, the Global
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks, the Swingline Lender, or any other Lender may have against
such Defaulting Lender or cause such Defaulting Lender to be a non-Defaulting Lender except as
expressly set forth above.
Section 2.12 Currency Indemnity.
(a) Payments in Agreed Currency. The Borrower shall, and shall cause the U.S. Guarantors to, make
payment relative to any Secured Indebtedness in the currency (the “Agreed Currency”) in which such
Secured Indebtedness was effected. If any payment is received on account of any Secured Indebtedness
in any currency (the “Other Currency”) other than the Agreed Currency (whether voluntarily or pursuant to
an order or judgment or the enforcement thereof or the realization of any collateral under the Security
Instruments or the liquidation of the Borrower or otherwise howsoever), such payment shall constitute a
discharge of the liability of the Borrower and U.S. Guarantors hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents in respect of such obligation only to the extent of the amount of the Agreed Currency which the
relevant Lender or Agent, as the case may be, is able to purchase with the amount of the Other Currency
received by it on the Business Day next following such receipt in accordance with its normal procedures
and after deducting any premium and costs of exchange.
(b) Conversion of Agreed Currency into Judgment Currency. If, for the purpose of obtaining or enforcing
judgment in any court in any jurisdiction, it becomes necessary to convert into a particular currency (the
“Judgment Currency”) any amount due in the Agreed Currency then the conversion shall be made on the
basis of the rate of exchange prevailing on the next Business Day following the date such judgment is
given and in any event the Borrower or its Restricted Subsidiary shall be obligated to pay the Agents and
the Lenders any deficiency in accordance with Section 2.12(c). For the foregoing purposes “rate of
exchange” means the lowest rate at which the relevant Lender or Agent, as applicable, in accordance with
its normal banking procedures is able on the relevant date to purchase the Agreed Currency with the
Judgment Currency after deducting any premium and costs of exchange.
(c) Circumstances Giving Rise to Indemnity. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, if (i) any
Lender or any Agent receives any payment or payments on account of the liability of the Borrower
hereunder pursuant to any judgment or order in any Other Currency, and (ii) the amount of the Agreed
Currency which the relevant Lender or Agent, as applicable, is able to purchase on the Business Day next
following such receipt with the proceeds of such payment or payments in accordance with its normal
procedures and after deducting any premiums and costs of exchange is less than the amount of the
Agreed Currency due in respect
63
of such liability immediately prior to such judgment or order, then the Borrower on demand shall, and the
Borrower hereby agrees to, indemnify the Lenders and the Agents from and against any loss, cost or
expense arising out of or in connection with such deficiency; provided that if the amount of the Agreed
Currency so purchased is greater than the amount of the Agreed Currency due in respect of such liability
immediately prior to such judgment or order, then the Agents or the Lenders, as the case may be, agree to
return the amount of any excess to the Borrower (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under
applicable law).
(d) Indemnity Separate Obligation. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the agreement of
indemnity provided for in Section 2.12(c) shall constitute an obligation separate and independent from all
other obligations contained in this Agreement, shall give rise to a separate and independent cause of
action, shall apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by the Lenders or Agents or any of them from
time to time, and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any judgment or order for a
liquidated sum in respect of an amount due hereunder or under any judgment or order.
ARTICLE 3
PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST; PREPAYMENTS; FEES
Section 3.01 Repayment of Loans. The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (a) to the Global
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Loan on the
Termination Date and (b) the Swingline Lender the unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan in
accordance with Section 2.10(b).
Section 3.02 Interest.
(a) ABR Loans. The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate
plus the Applicable Margin for ABR Loans, but in no event to exceed the Highest Lawful Rate.
(b) Eurodollar Loans. The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted
LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Margin for Eurodollar
Loans, but in no event to exceed the Highest Lawful Rate.
(c) Default Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or
other amount payable by the Borrower or any Guarantor hereunder or under any other Loan Document is
not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall
bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue
principal of any Loan, the lesser of (A) the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the
preceding paragraphs of this Section plus 2% or (B) the Highest Lawful Rate or (ii) in the case of any other
amount, the lesser of (A) the Default Rate or (B) the Highest Lawful Rate.
(d) Interest Payment Dates. Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest
Payment Date for such Loan and on the Termination Date; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to
Section 3.02(c) shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan
(other than an optional prepayment of an ABR Loan prior to the Termination Date), accrued interest on the
principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be
64
payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment, and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any
Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall
be payable on the effective date of such conversion (but only to the extent so converted).
(e) Interest Rate Computations. All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360
days, unless such computation would exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, in which case interest shall be
computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), except that interest computed by
reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate
shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall
be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The
applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Global
Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and be binding
upon the parties hereto.
Section 3.03 Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar
Borrowing:
(a) the Global Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest
error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the
LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period; or
(b) the Global Administrative Agent is advised by the Majority Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or
LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such
Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Global Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by
telephone, electronic mail or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Global
Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such
notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to,
or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective, and (ii) if any Borrowing
Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.
Section 3.04 Prepayments.
(a) Optional Prepayments. The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay
any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with Section 3.04(b).
(b) Notice and Terms of Optional Prepayment. The Borrower shall notify the Global Administrative Agent
(and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) by telephone (confirmed by
electronic mail or telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurodollar
Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, Chicago time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment,
or (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing or Swingline Loan, not later than 12:00 noon,
Chicago time, one Business Day before
65
the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the Borrowing to be
prepaid, the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid;
provided that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the
Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.06(b), then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such
notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.06(b). Promptly following receipt of any such
notice relating to a Borrowing, the Global Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents
thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the
case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02. The Global
Administrative Agent shall apply each prepayment of a Borrowing ratably to the Loans included in the
Borrowing specified in the Borrower’s notice of prepayment. Prepayments shall be accompanied by
accrued interest to the extent required by Section 3.02.
(c) Mandatory Prepayments. Subject to Section 3.04(d) below, the Borrower shall be required to prepay
the Borrowings hereunder and shall be required to cause QRCI to prepay the Canadian Borrowings in
accordance with the following, to the extent QRCI does not otherwise make such prepayment in
accordance with the Canadian Credit Agreement:
(i) If, after giving effect to any termination or reduction of the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts pursuant
to Section 2.06(b), the total Revolving Credit Exposures exceeds the total Commitments, then the
Borrower shall (A) prepay the Borrowings on the date of such termination or reduction in an aggregate
principal amount equal to such excess, and (B) if any excess remains after prepaying all of the Borrowings
as a result of an LC Exposure, pay to the Global Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders an amount
equal to such excess to be held as cash collateral as provided in Section 2.08(j).
(ii) Upon any redetermination of or adjustment to the amount of the Global Borrowing Base in accordance
with Section 2.07, Section 8.12(c) or Section 9.10 (solely as a result of a Casualty Event), if the total
Combined Credit Exposures exceeds the redetermined or adjusted Global Borrowing Base or the
Revolving Credit Exposures exceeds the redetermined or adjusted U.S. Borrowing Base, then the
Borrower shall, at its option, either (A) make (or cause to be made) a single payment of principal in an
amount equal to such Global Borrowing Base Deficiency or U.S. Borrowing Base Deficiency, as
applicable, and, if any Global Borrowing Base Deficiency or U.S. Borrowing Base Deficiency remains after
prepaying all of the Borrowings and Canadian Borrowings as a result of an LC Exposure, pay to the
Global Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders an amount equal to such remaining excess to be
held as cash collateral as provided in Section 2.08(j), in each case, within thirty (30) days following its
receipt of the New Borrowing Base Notice in accordance with Section 2.07(d) or the date the adjustment
occurs (the “Deficiency Notification Date”), (B) make (or cause to be made) six payments of principal each
of which shall be in an amount equal to one-sixth (1/6th) of such Global Borrowing Base Deficiency (or if a
U.S. Borrowing Base Deficiency exists, but not a Global Borrowing Base Deficiency, one-sixth (1/6th) of
the amount of such U.S. Borrowing Base Deficiency) commencing on the 15th day of a calendar month
that is at least thirty (30) days following the Deficiency Notification Date and on the 15th day of each of the
five calendar months thereafter, (C) within forty-five (45) days
66
following the Deficiency Notification Date, submit (and pledge as Collateral) additional Oil and Gas
Properties owned by the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries which are or shall become a
Guarantor contemporaneously with such submission pursuant to Section 8.13 for consideration in
connection with the determination of the Global Borrowing Base and U.S. Borrowing Base which the
Global Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders (or Required U.S. Lenders, if applicable) deem
satisfactory, in their sole discretion, to eliminate such Global Borrowing Base Deficiency and/or U.S.
Borrowing Base Deficiency, (D) within fifteen (15) days following the Deficiency Notification Date, in the
case of a U.S. Borrowing Base Deficiency, reallocate the U.S. Borrowing Base under Section 2.07(e) to
the Allocated U.S. Borrowing Base in amount not less than such U.S. Borrowing Base Deficiency or
(E) within fifteen (15), thirty (30) or forty-five (45) days following the Deficiency Notification Date, as
applicable, eliminate such Global Borrowing Base Deficiency and/or U.S Borrowing Base Deficiency
through a combination of a payment, submission of additional Oil and Gas Properties and/or reallocation
of the U.S. Borrowing Base as set forth in clauses (A), (C) or (D) above; provided that all payments
required to be made pursuant to this Section 3.04(c)(ii) must be made on or prior to the Termination Date.
Not later than 15 days following the Deficiency Notification Date, the Borrower shall provide written notice
to the Global Administrative Agent setting forth its election pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence.
(iii) Upon any adjustments to the Global Borrowing Base and/or the U.S. Borrowing Base pursuant to
Section 9.02(n) or Section 9.10 (other than adjustments resulting directly from Casualty Events), if the total
Combined Credit Exposures exceeds the Global Borrowing Base or the Revolving Credit Exposures
exceeds the U.S. Borrowing Base as adjusted, then the Borrower shall (A) prepay the Borrowings in an
aggregate principal amount equal to such Global Borrowing Base Deficiency or U.S. Borrowing Base
Deficiency, as applicable, and (B) if any excess remains after prepaying all of the Borrowings and
Canadian Borrowings as a result of an LC Exposure, pay to the Global Administrative Agent on behalf of
the Lenders an amount equal to such excess to be held as cash collateral as provided in Section 2.08(j).
The Borrower shall be obligated to make such prepayment and/or deposit of cash collateral (x) within thirty
(30) days following the effective date of any such adjustment to the Global Borrowing Base and/or the U.S.
Borrowing Base under Section 9.02(n) or (y) prior to or contemporaneously with such adjustment to the
Global Borrowing Base and/or the U.S. Borrowing Base under Section 9.10 (other than adjustments
resulting directly from Casualty Events); provided that all payments required to be made pursuant to this
Section 3.04(c)(iii) must be made on or prior to the Termination Date.
(iv) Each prepayment of Borrowings pursuant to this Section 3.04(c) shall be applied, first, ratably to any
ABR Borrowings then outstanding, and, second, to any Eurodollar Borrowings then outstanding, and if
more than one Eurodollar Borrowing is then outstanding, to each such Eurodollar Borrowing in order of
priority beginning with the Eurodollar Borrowing with the highest interest rate applicable thereto and
ending with the Eurodollar Borrowing with the lowest interest rate applicable thereto.
(v) Each prepayment of Borrowings pursuant to this Section 3.04(c) shall be applied ratably to the Loans
included in the prepaid Borrowings. Prepayments pursuant to this Section 3.04(c) shall be accompanied
by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 3.02.
67
(d) No Premium or Penalty. Prepayments permitted or required under this Section 3.04 shall be without
premium or penalty, except as required under Section 5.02.
Section 3.05 Fees.
(a) Commitment Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Global Administrative Agent for the account of
each Lender (other than a Defaulting Lender to the extent set forth in Section 2.11) a commitment fee,
which shall accrue at the applicable Commitment Fee Rate on the average daily amount of the unused
Commitment of such Lender during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the
Termination Date. Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the third Business Day
following the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the Termination
Date, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date. All commitment fees shall be
computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, unless such computation would exceed the Highest Lawful
Rate, in which case interest shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap
year), and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the
last day).
(b) Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Global Administrative Agent for the account
of each Lender (other than a Defaulting Lender to the extent set forth in Section 2.11) a participation fee
with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable Margin
used to determine the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Loans on the average daily amount of such
Lender’s LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements
which has been funded by such Lender) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but
excluding the later of the date on which such Lender’s Commitment terminates and the date on which such
Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, (ii) to each Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the
rate per annum agreed to with such Issuing Bank on the average daily amount of that portion of the LC
Exposure attributable to such Issuing Bank (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC
Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the
date of termination of the Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure
attributable to such Issuing Bank, provided that (x) if the expiration date of the Letter of Credit is less than
one year after its date of issuance and the aggregate fronting fee otherwise payable through its expiration
would be less than $500, then the Borrower shall pay to such Issuing Bank $500 upon the issuance of
such Letter of Credit in lieu of the fronting fee otherwise payable and (y) no fronting fee shall be payable
with respect to any Grandfathered Letters of Credit on the Effective Date or thereafter, until and unless
such Grandfathered Letter of Credit is extended, renewed or reissued hereunder, and (iii) to each Issuing
Bank, for its own account, its standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension
of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued
through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall be
payable in arrears on the third Business Day following such last
68
day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date; provided that all such fees shall
be payable on the Termination Date and any such fees accruing after the Termination Date shall be
payable on demand. Any other fees payable to an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 3.05(b) shall be
payable within 10 days after demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the
basis of a year of 360 days, unless such computation would exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, in which
case interest shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and shall
be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
(c) Global Administrative Agent Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Global Administrative Agent, for
its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the
Borrower and the Global Administrative Agent.
ARTICLE 4
PAYMENTS; PRO RATA TREATMENT; SHARING OF SET-OFFS
Section 4.01 Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.
(a) Payments by the Borrower. The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it
hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts
payable under Section 5.01, Section 5.02, Section 5.03 or otherwise) prior to 2:00 p.m., Chicago time, on
the date when due (for purposes of computing interest and fees, each such payment made after such time
on such due date to be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day), in immediately
available funds, without defense, deduction, recoupment, set-off or counterclaim. Fees, once paid, shall be
fully earned and shall not be refundable under any circumstances, absent manifest error. Any amounts
received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Global Administrative Agent, be deemed
to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.
All such payments shall be made to the Global Administrative Agent at its offices specified in
Section 12.01, except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank as expressly provided herein and
except that payments pursuant to Section 5.01, Section 5.02, Section 5.03 and Section 12.03 shall be
made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Global Administrative Agent shall distribute any such
payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following
receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for
payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment
accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments
hereunder shall be made in Dollars.
(b) Application of Insufficient Payments. If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to
the Global Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements,
interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and
fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of
interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed
LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the
amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
69
(c) Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim
or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans, participations in
LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion
of the aggregate amount of its Loans, participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and
accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such
greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans, participations in LC
Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all
such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of
principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans, participations in LC Disbursements and
Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the
payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price
restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this Section 4.01(c) shall
not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the
express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment
of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans, participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans to
any assignee or Participant, other than to the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as
to which the provisions of this Section 4.01(c) shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and
agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off
and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the
Borrower in the amount of such participation.
Section 4.02 Presumption of Payment by the Borrower. Unless the Global Administrative Agent shall have
received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Global
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or any Issuing Bank that the Borrower will not make
such payment, the Global Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on
such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or
such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact
made such payment, then each of the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees
to repay to the Global Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender
or such Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is
distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Global Administrative Agent, at the greater of
the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Global Administrative Agent in accordance
with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
Section 4.03 Certain Deductions by the Global Administrative Agent. If any Lender shall fail to make any
payment required to be made by it hereunder, pursuant to Section 2.05(a), Section 2.08(d), Section 2.08(e)
or Section 4.02 or otherwise, then the Global Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding
any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Global Administrative Agent
for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender’s obligations under such Sections until all such
unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
70
Section 4.04 Disposition of Proceeds. The Security Instruments contain an assignment by the Borrower
and/or the Guarantors unto and in favor of the Global Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured
Parties of all of the Borrower’s or each Guarantor’s interest in and to production and all proceeds
attributable thereto which may be produced from or allocated to the Mortgaged Property. The Security
Instruments further provide in general for the application of such proceeds to the satisfaction of the
Secured Indebtedness and other obligations described therein and secured thereby. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in the Security Instruments, until the occurrence of an Event of Default,
Section 4.05 the Global Administrative Agent and the Lenders agree that they will neither notify the
purchaser or purchasers of production from or allocated to the Mortgaged Property nor take any other
action to cause the proceeds thereof to be remitted to the Global Administrative Agent or the Lenders, but
the Lenders will instead permit such proceeds to be paid to the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries
and Section 4.06 the Lenders hereby authorize the Global Administrative Agent to take such actions as
may be necessary to cause such proceeds to be paid to the Borrower and/or such Restricted Subsidiaries.
INCREASED COSTS; BREAK FUNDING PAYMENTS; PAYMENTS; TAXES; ILLEGALITY
ARTICLE 5
Section 5.01 Increased Costs.
(a) Changes in Law. If any Change in Law shall:
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets
of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve
requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate); or
(ii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or
Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining
any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of
any sum received or receivable by such Lender (whether of principal, interest or otherwise, but not
including Excluded Taxes), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts
as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender or any Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding
capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or such
Issuing Bank’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s holding company, if any,
as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by,
such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender
or such Issuing Bank or such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s holding company could have achieved but
for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s policies and the
policies of such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then
71
from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender’s or
such Issuing Bank’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c) Certificates. A certificate of a Lender or any Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary
to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified
in Section 5.01(a) or (b) shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
The Borrower shall pay such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due
on any such certificate within 30 days after receipt thereof.
(d) Effect of Failure or Delay in Requesting Compensation. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or
any Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 5.01 shall not constitute a waiver of
such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower
shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 5.01 for any
increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or such
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such
increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s intention to claim
compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or
reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period
of retroactive effect thereof.
Section 5.02 Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurodollar
Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of
Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan into an ABR Loan other than on the last day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow as a result of a failure to satisfy the conditions
set forth in Section 6.02, any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant
hereto, or (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.04(a), then, in any such
event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such
event (exclusive of any lost profits or opportunity costs or processing or other related fees). In the case of a
Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount
determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued
on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would
have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then
current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that
would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on
such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the
commencement of such period, for Dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in
the eurodollar market.
A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive
pursuant to this Section 5.02 shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest
error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10
Business Days after receipt thereof.
Section 5.03 Taxes.
72
(a) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower or
any Guarantor under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if the Borrower or any Guarantor shall be required to
deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be
increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section 5.03(a)), the Global Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing
Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower or such Guarantor shall make such deductions and (iii) the
Borrower or such Guarantor shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable law.
(b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. The Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(c) Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify the Global Administrative Agent, each
Lender and each Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Global Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the
Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to
amounts payable under this Section 5.03) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or
legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority; provided that the Borrower shall not
be required to indemnify the Global Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank for any amounts
under this Section 5.03(c) to the extent that such Person fails to notify the Borrower of its intent to make a
claim for indemnification under this Section 5.03(c) within 180 days after a claim is asserted against such
Person by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate of the Global Administrative Agent, a Lender
or an Issuing Bank as to the amount of such payment or liability under this Section 5.03, together with, to
the extent available, reasonable supporting documentation relating to such payment or liability, shall be
delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Global Administrative Agent
the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such
payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Global Administrative Agent.
(e) Status of Lenders. (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax
with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Global
Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably
73
requested by the Borrower or the Global Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed
documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Global Administrative Agent as will permit
such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender,
if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Global Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other
documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Global
Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Global Administrative Agent to determine whether
or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such
documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 5.03(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below)
shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission
would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the
legal or commercial position of such Lender.
(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Global Administrative Agent on
or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time
thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Global Administrative Agent), executed
originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;
(B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the
Global Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to
the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time
thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Global Administrative Agent), whichever of
the following is applicable:
(1) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States
is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS
Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to
the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any
Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal
withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty;
(2) executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI;
(3) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under
Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the effect that such
Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent
shareholder” of the Borrower
74
within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in
Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed originals of IRS
Form W-8BEN; or
(4) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY,
accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially
in the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each
beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct
or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign
Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of
each such direct and indirect partner;
(C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the
Global Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to
the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time
thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Global Administrative Agent), executed
originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a
reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary
documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Global Administrative
Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding
Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of
FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender
shall deliver to the Borrower and the Global Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law
and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Global Administrative Agent such
documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the
Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Global
Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Global Administrative Agent to comply
with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s
obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely
for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of
this Agreement.
75
Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or
inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the
Global Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
(f) Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Global Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand
therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower
has not already indemnified the Global Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without
limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to
comply with the provisions of Section 12.04(c) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and
(iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Global
Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted
by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered
to any Lender by the Global Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender
hereby authorizes the Global Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time
owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Global Administrative Agent
to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Global Administrative Agent under this
paragraph (f).
(g) Tax Refunds. If the Global Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has
received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the
Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to Section 5.03, it
shall pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or
additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under Section 5.03 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Global Administrative
Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental
Authority with respect to such refund); provided, that the Borrower, upon the request of the Global
Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any
penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Global
Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Global Administrative Agent or such Lender is
required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section 5.03(g) shall not be construed
to require the Global Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other
information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
Section 5.04 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(a) Designation of Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 5.01, or if
the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the
account of any Lender pursuant to Section 5.03, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to
designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and
obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender,
such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 5.01 or
Section 5.03, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed
cost or expense
76
and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender solely as a result of such designation or
assignment.
(b) Replacement of Lenders. If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 5.01, or (ii) the
Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the
account of any Lender pursuant to Section 5.03, or (iii) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, or (iv) any
Lender has asserted that any adoption or change of the type described in Section 5.05 has occurred, or
(v) any Lender fails to approve an amendment, waiver or other modification to this Agreement and at least
the Required Lenders have approved such amendment, waiver or other modification, or (vi) any Lender
fails to approve an increase of the Borrowing Base and at least the Required Lenders have approved such
increase, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Global
Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with
and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 12.04(b)), all its interests, rights and obligations under
this Agreement to an assignee that shall (A) assume such obligations and (B) in the case of clauses
(v) and (vi), consent to such amendment, waiver, modification, increase, decrease or reaffirmation (which
assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that 1 if such assignee
is not a Lender, the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Global Administrative
Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, 2 such Lender shall have received payment of
an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements, accrued
interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the
extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other
amounts) and 3 in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under
Section 5.01 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 5.03, such assignment will result in a
reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such
assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the
circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
Section 5.05 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:
(a) In the event that it becomes unlawful for any Lender or its applicable lending office to honor its
obligation to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans either generally or having a particular Interest Period
hereunder, then (i) such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Global Administrative Agent
thereof and such Lender’s obligation to make such Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended (the “Affected
Loans”) until such time as such Lender may again make and maintain such Eurodollar Loans and (ii) all
Affected Loans which would otherwise be made by such Lender shall be made instead as ABR Loans
(and, if such Lender so requests by notice to the Borrower and the Global Administrative Agent, all
Affected Loans of such Lender then outstanding shall be automatically converted into ABR Loans on the
date specified by such Lender in such notice) and, to the extent that Affected Loans are so made as (or
converted into) ABR Loans, all payments of principal which would otherwise be applied to such Lender’s
Affected Loans shall be applied instead to its ABR Loans; and
77
(b) If it becomes unlawful for any Lender or its applicable lending office to honor its obligation to make any
Loans to the Borrower, then such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Global Administrative
Agent thereof and such Lender’s obligation to make Loans shall be suspended until such time as such
Lender may again make and maintain Loans to the Borrower. The Borrower shall have no obligation to
pay to such Lender the commitment fee described in Section 3.05(a) that would otherwise accrue during
such period of suspension.

Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary to the Global Administrative Agent or any Lender or any of their
Affiliates in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the
Canadian Credit Agreement or any other
83
Canadian Loan Document or delivered hereunder or under any other Loan Document or the Canadian
Credit Agreement or any other Canadian Loan Document (as modified or supplemented by other
information so furnished), when furnished (and, with respect to any such information delivered to the
Global Administrative Agent or any Lender or any of their Affiliates prior to the Effective Date, on the
Effective Date), contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not materially
misleading (other than omissions that pertain to matters of a general economic nature or matters of public
knowledge that generally affect any of the industry segments of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries); provided
that, with respect to projected financial information, prospect information, geological and geophysical data
and engineering projections, the Borrower represents only that such information was prepared in good
faith based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time, recognizing that (a) there are
industry-wide risks normally associated with the types of business conducted by the Borrower and its

Reserve Report are necessarily based upon professional opinions, estimates and projections and that the
Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries do not warrant that such opinions, estimates and projections will
ultimately prove to have been accurate.

(a) Each of the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries has good and defensible title to the material Oil
and Gas Properties evaluated in the Reserve Reports used in the most recent determination of the Global
Borrowing Base and good title to all its personal Properties that are necessary to permit the Borrower and
the Restricted Subsidiaries to conduct their business in all material respects in the same manner as its
business has been conducted prior to the date hereof, in each case, subject to Immaterial Title
Deficiencies and free and clear of all Liens except Liens
84
permitted by Section 9.03 (subject to the penultimate sentence thereof). Subject to Immaterial Title
Deficiencies and after giving full effect to Liens permitted by Section 9.03 (subject to the penultimate
sentence thereof), the Borrower or the Restricted Subsidiary specified as the owner owns the net interests
in production attributable to the Hydrocarbon Interests as reflected in the most recently delivered Reserve
Reports. The ownership of such Oil and Gas Properties shall not obligate the Borrower or such Restricted
Subsidiary to bear the costs and expenses relating to the maintenance, development and operations of
each such Oil and Gas Property in an amount materially in excess of the working interest of each Oil and
Gas Property set forth in the most recently delivered Reserve Reports that is not offset by a corresponding
proportionate increase in the Borrower’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s net revenue interest in such Oil
and Gas Property; provided that the Borrower or any applicable Restricted Subsidiary shall have the right
or obligation to bear costs disproportionate to the Borrower’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s working
interest with respect to any Hydrocarbon Interest for a period of time in order to earn, or in connection with
the acquisition of, an interest in such Hydrocarbon Interest as evidenced by written agreement.
(b) All material leases and agreements necessary for the conduct of the business of the Borrower and the
Restricted Subsidiaries are valid and subsisting, in full force and effect, and there exists no default or event
or circumstance which with the giving of notice or the passage of time or both would give rise to a default
under any such lease or leases.
(c) The rights and Properties presently owned, leased or licensed by the Borrower and the Restricted
Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, all easements and rights of way, include all rights and
Properties necessary to permit the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries to conduct their business in
the same manner as its business has been conducted prior to the date hereof.
(d) The Borrower and each Restricted Subsidiary owns, or is licensed to use, (i) all trademarks,
tradenames, copyrights, patents and other intellectual Property material to its business, and the use
thereof by the Borrower and such Restricted Subsidiary does not infringe upon the rights of any other
Person and (ii) all databases, geological data, geophysical data, engineering data, seismic data, maps,
interpretations and other technical information the use of which is material to their businesses as presently
conducted, subject to the limitations contained in the agreements governing the use of the same, which
limitations are customary for companies engaged in the business of the exploration and production of
Hydrocarbons.
Section 7.15 Federal Reserve Regulations. The Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not engaged
principally, or as one of its or their important activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose,
whether immediate, incidental or ultimate, of buying or carrying margin stock (within the meaning of
Regulation T, U or X of the Board). No part of the proceeds of any Loan or Letter of Credit will be used for
any purpose which violates the provisions of Regulations T, U or X of the Board.

or any Subsidiary maintains sponsors, or contributes to (or has at any
85
time in the six-year period preceding the date hereof, maintained, sponsored, or contributed to) any
Pension Plan or Multiemployer Plan. Except in such instances where an action, omission or failure would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each Plan maintained by the Borrower or
any Restricted Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary is in
compliance with the terms of such Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code with respect
to each Plan. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together
with all other such ERISA Events for which liability is reasonably expected to occur, would reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Except in such instances where an action, omission, or
failure would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (i) each Plan that is intended
to be “qualified” within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code is, and has been during the period from
its adoption to date, so qualified, both as to form and operation, and all necessary governmental approvals,
including a favorable determination as to the qualification under the Code of such Plan and each
amendment thereto, have been or will be timely obtained, and (ii) the actuarial present value of the benefit
liabilities (within the meaning of section 4041 of ERISA) under each Plan which is subject to Title IV of
ERISA does not, as of the end of the most recently ended fiscal year, exceed the current value of the
assets (computed on a plan termination basis in accordance with Title IV of ERISA) of such Plan allocable
to such benefit liabilities. Neither the Borrower nor any Restricted Subsidiary nor any ERISA Affiliate of the
Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary maintains or contributes to any Plan that provides a post-
employment health benefit, other than a benefit required under Section 601 of ERISA, or maintains or
contributes to a Plan that provides health benefits that is not fully funded except where the failure to fully
fund such Plan would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof,
neither the Borrower nor any Restricted Subsidiary nor any ERISA Affiliate of the Borrower or any
Restricted Subsidiary maintains a multiple employer welfare benefit arrangement within the meaning of
Section 3(40)(A) of ERISA
(b) Except as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (i) the Canadian
Pension Plans, if any, are duly registered under the Income Tax Act (Canada) and all applicable provincial
or federal pension benefits standards legislation and no event has occurred which is reasonably likely to
cause the loss of such registered status; (ii) all obligations of the Canadian Subsidiaries (including any
applicable fiduciary, funding, investment and administration obligations) required to be performed in
connection with the Canadian Pension Plans, if any, have been performed in accordance with applicable
laws and regulations; (iii) no promises of benefit improvements under the Canadian Pension Plans, if any,
or the Canadian Benefit Plans have been made; (iv) all reports and disclosures relating to the Canadian
Pension Plans and Canadian Benefit Plans required by any applicable laws or regulations have been
filed or distributed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations; (v) no Canadian Subsidiary has
made any improper withdrawals prohibited by applicable law, or applications of, the assets of any of the
Canadian Pension Plans; (vi) no Canadian Pension Plan Termination Event has occurred; (vii) no
Canadian Subsidiary has any knowledge that the Canadian Pension Plans, if any, are the subject of an
investigation, any other proceeding, an action or a claim other than a routine claim for benefits; (viii) all
contributions or premiums required to be made by any Canadian Subsidiary to the Canadian Pension
Plans and the Canadian Benefit Plans have been made within the time limits required by, and in
accordance with, the terms of such plans and applicable laws and regulations; and (ix) all employee
contributions to the Canadian Pension Plans, if any, required to be made by way of authorized payroll
deduction have been properly
86
withheld and fully paid into such plans within the time limits required by, and in accordance with, the terms
of such plans and applicable laws and regulations. No Canadian Subsidiary contributes or has made
contributions on behalf of its employees to a multi-employer pension plan, as such term is defined under
applicable Canadian provincial or federal pension benefits standards legislation. No Canadian Pension
Plan has an Unfunded Current Liability that would, individually or when taken together with any other
liabilities referenced in this Section 7.16(a), reasonably be anticipated to have a Material Adverse Effect.
There has been no failure to administer or operate the Foreign Plans in accordance with the terms thereof
except for any failure to so administer or operate the Foreign Plans as could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

whole, will exceed the aggregate Debt of the Borrower and the Guarantors on a consolidated basis, as the
Debt becomes absolute and matures, (b) each of the Borrower and the Guarantors will not have incurred
Debt beyond its ability to pay such Debt (after taking into account the timing and amounts of cash to be
received by each of the Borrower and the Guarantors and the amounts to be payable on or in respect of its
liabilities, and giving effect to amounts that could reasonably be received by reason of indemnity, offset,
insurance or any similar arrangement) as such Debt becomes absolute and matures and (c) each of the
Borrower and the Guarantors will not have unreasonably small capital for the conduct of its business.

(h) Other Requested Information. Promptly following any request therefor, such other information regarding
the operations, business affairs and financial condition of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary
(including, without limitation, any Canadian Pension Plan, Plan or Multiemployer Plan and any reports or
other information required to be filed under ERISA), as the Global Administrative Agent or any Lender may
reasonably request.
Documents required to be delivered pursuant to Section 8.01 may be delivered electronically and if so
delivered, shall be deemed to have been delivered on the date (i) on which (A) the Borrower posts such
documents, or provides a link thereto on the Borrower’s website on the Internet at www.qrinc.com or
(B) such documents are publically available on the SEC’s EDGAR website or (ii) on which such

Administrative Agent have access (whether a commercial, third-party website or whether sponsored by the
Global Administrative Agent); provided that the Borrower shall deliver such documents in a form
acceptable to the Global Administrative Agent. Except for such compliance certificates, the Global
Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to request the delivery or to maintain copies of the
documents referred to above, and in any event shall have no responsibility to monitor compliance by the
Borrower with any such request for delivery, and each Lender shall be solely responsible for requesting
delivery to it or maintaining its copies of such documents. Any notices, certificates, statements or other

the Canadian Credit Agreement shall be deemed to have been so delivered under this Agreement on the
date on which the Borrower delivers such notices, certificates statements or other documents under the
Canadian Credit Agreement.

occurrence thereof, the Borrower will furnish to the Global Administrative Agent written notice of the
following:
(a) the occurrence of any Default;
(b) the filing or commencement of any action, suit, proceeding, investigation or arbitration by or before any
arbitrator or Governmental Authority against or affecting the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof not previously
disclosed in writing to the Lenders or any material adverse development in any action, suit, proceeding,
investigation or arbitration (whether or not previously disclosed to the Lenders) that, in either case, if
adversely determined, would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect; and
(c) the filing or commencement of any action, suit, proceeding, investigation or arbitration by or before any

Officer setting forth the details of the event or development requiring such notice and any action taken or
proposed to be taken with respect thereto.
Section 8.03 Existence; Conduct of Business. The Borrower will, and will cause each Restricted
Subsidiary to, do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve, renew and keep in full force and
effect its legal existence and the rights, licenses, permits, privileges and franchises material to the conduct
of its business and maintain, if necessary, its qualification to do business in each other jurisdiction in
which its Oil and Gas Properties are located or the ownership of such Properties requires such

Adverse Effect; provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit any merger, consolidation, liquidation or
dissolution permitted under Section 9.09.
Section 8.04 Payment of Obligations. The Borrower will, and will cause each Restricted Subsidiary to, pay
its obligations, including Tax liabilities and remittance liabilities of the Borrower and all of its Restricted
Subsidiaries, before the same shall become delinquent or in default, except where (i) (A) the validity or
amount thereof is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, and (B) the Borrower or such
Restricted Subsidiary has set aside on its books adequate reserves with respect thereto in accordance
with GAAP or (ii) the failure to make payment would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect or result in the seizure or levy of any Oil and Gas Property of the Borrower or any Restricted
Subsidiary that was evaluated in the Reserve Reports used in the most recent determination of the Global
Borrowing Base.
Section 8.05 Operation and Maintenance of Properties. The Borrower will and will cause each Restricted
Subsidiary to, in all material respects: (a) promptly pay and discharge, or make reasonable efforts to cause
to be paid and discharged, when due all delay rentals, royalties and expenses accruing under the leases
or other agreements affecting or pertaining to its material Oil and Gas Properties evaluated in the Reserve
Reports used in the most recent determination of the Global Borrowing Base, provided that, in the case of
delay rentals, the Borrower and/or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary shall only be required to pay and
discharge, or make reasonable efforts to pay and discharge, delay rentals as and to the extent the
Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary determines in good faith that payment and discharge thereof is in
the Borrower’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s, as applicable, best interest, (b) perform, or make
reasonable and customary efforts to cause to be performed, the obligations of the Borrower or any such
Restricted Subsidiary required by each and all of the assignments, deeds, leases, subleases, contracts
and agreements affecting its interests in its material Oil and Gas Properties evaluated in the Reserve
Reports used in the most recent determination of the Global Borrowing Base, (c) do all other things
necessary to keep unimpaired, except for Liens permitted by the Loan Documents, its rights with respect to
its material Oil and Gas Properties evaluated in the Reserve Reports used in the most recent
determination of the Global Borrowing Base and prevent any forfeiture thereof or a default thereunder,
(d) keep and maintain all Oil and Gas Property material to the conduct of its business in good working
order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted and (e) to the extent the Borrower is not the operator
of any Property, the Borrower shall use reasonable efforts to cause the operator to comply with this
Section 8.05, except (x) to the extent a portion of such Oil and Gas Properties is no longer capable of
producing
91
Hydrocarbons in economically reasonable amounts, (y) for dispositions permitted by this Agreement or
(z) when the failure to do so would not, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.
Section 8.06 Insurance. The Borrower will, and will cause each Restricted Subsidiary to, maintain, with
financially sound and reputable insurance companies, insurance in such amounts and against such risks
as are customarily maintained by companies engaged in the same or similar businesses operating in the
same or similar locations. The loss payable clauses or provisions in said insurance policy or policies
insuring any of the collateral for the Loans or the Canadian Loans, as applicable, shall be endorsed in
favor of the applicable Administrative Agent as its interests in the collateral may appear and such policies
shall name the applicable Administrative Agent and the Lenders or the Canadian Lenders, as applicable,
as “additional insureds” and provide that the insurer will endeavor to give at least 30 days prior notice of
any cancellation to the applicable Administrative Agent.
Section 8.07 Books and Records; Inspection Rights. The Borrower will, and will cause each Restricted
Subsidiary to, keep proper books of record and account in which full, true and correct entries are made of
all dealings and transactions in relation to its business and activities. The Borrower will, and will cause
each Restricted Subsidiary to, permit any representatives designated by the Global Administrative Agent
or any Lender (coordinated through and together with the Global Administrative Agent), upon reasonable
prior notice, to visit and inspect its Oil and Gas Properties, to examine and make extracts from its books
and records, and to discuss its affairs, finances and condition with its officers and independent
accountants, all at such reasonable times during the Borrower’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s normal
business hours (and in a manner so as to the extent practicable, not to unreasonably interfere with the
normal business operations of the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary) not more than one (1) time per
fiscal year; provided, that to the extent an Event of Default then exists, as often as reasonably requested.
The Lenders shall bear the cost of such inspections and examinations unless an Event of Default then
exists, in which event the Borrower shall bear such cost.
Section 8.08 Compliance with Laws. The Borrower will, and will cause each Restricted Subsidiary to,
comply with all Governmental Requirements applicable to it or its Oil and Gas Properties, except where
the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.
Section 8.09 Environmental Matters. (a) Except to the extent that the failure to do so would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (i) the Borrower shall, and shall cause each Restricted
Subsidiary to, comply with all applicable Environmental Laws, including, without limitation, (x) all
licensing, permitting, notification, and similar requirements of Environmental Laws, and (y) all provisions of
Environmental Laws regarding storage, discharge, release, transportation, treatment and disposal of
Hazardous Materials and (ii) the Borrower shall, and shall cause each Restricted Subsidiary to, promptly
pay and discharge when due all claims, liabilities and obligations with respect to any clean-up or
remediation measures necessary to comply with applicable Environmental Laws, provided that such
payment or discharge shall not be required to the extent that (A) the amount, applicability or validity thereof
is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings promptly initiated and diligently conducted
and (B) Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary, as and to the extent required in accordance with GAAP,
shall have set aside on its books reserves (segregated to the extent required by GAAP) deemed by them
to be adequate with respect thereto.
92
(b) To the extent the Borrower or a Restricted Subsidiary is not the operator of any Property, none of the
Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be obligated to directly perform any undertakings
contemplated by the covenants and agreements contained in this Section 8.09 which are performable only
by such operators or are beyond the control of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the above and except to the extent that the failure to do so would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, the Borrower shall be obligated to enforce such operators’
contractual obligations to maintain, develop and operate the Oil and Gas Properties subject to such
operating agreements, and the Borrower shall, and shall cause its Restricted Subsidiaries to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the operator to comply with this Section 8.09.
(c) To the extent reasonably requested by the Global Administrative Agent, the Borrower will, and will
cause each Restricted Subsidiary to, provide environmental assessment, audit or test reports of any Oil
and Gas Properties of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary, provided an Event of Default then exists
or the Global Administrative Agent has a reasonable suspicion that either an Event of Default or a breach
of any representation or warranty set forth in Section 7.06 hereof then exists.
(d) In connection with any acquisition by Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary of any Oil and Gas
Property for consideration of at least $25,000,000, other than an acquisition of additional interests in Oil
and Gas Properties in which Borrower or any Subsidiary previously held an interest, to the extent Borrower
or such Restricted Subsidiary obtains or is provided with the same, the Borrower shall, promptly following
Borrower’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s obtaining or being provided with the same, deliver to the
Global Administrative Agent such final and non-privileged material environmental reports of such Oil and
Gas Properties as are reasonably requested by the Global Administrative Agent.
Section 8.10 Further Assurances. (a) The Borrower at its sole expense will, and will cause each Restricted
Subsidiary to, promptly execute and deliver to the applicable Administrative Agent all such other
documents, agreements and instruments reasonably requested by the applicable Administrative Agent to
comply with, cure any defects or accomplish the conditions precedent, covenants and agreements of the
Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, in the Loan Documents and Canadian Loan
Documents, including the Notes and Canadian Notes, or to further evidence and more fully describe the
collateral intended as security for the Secured Indebtedness or the Canadian Secured Indebtedness, as
applicable, or to correct any omissions in this Agreement, the Canadian Credit Agreement, the Security
Instruments or the Canadian Security Instruments, or to state more fully the obligations secured therein, or
to perfect, protect or preserve any Liens created pursuant to this Agreement, the Canadian Credit
Agreement or any of the Security Instruments or Canadian Security Instruments or the priority thereof, or to
make any recordings, file any notices or obtain any consents, all as may be reasonably necessary or
appropriate, in the sole discretion of the applicable Administrative Agent, in connection therewith.
93
(b) The Borrower hereby authorizes the applicable Administrative Agent to file one or more financing or
continuation statements, and amendments thereto, or any equivalent thereto in Canada or any province
thereof relative to all or any part of the Mortgaged Property without the signature of the Borrower, QRCI or
any other Guarantor where permitted by law. A carbon, photographic or other reproduction of the Security
Instruments or the Canadian Security Instruments, as applicable, or any financing statement covering the
Mortgaged Property or any part thereof shall be sufficient as a financing statement where permitted by law.
Section 8.11 Reserve Reports.
(a) On or before May 1, 2012 and April 1st of each year thereafter, the Borrower shall (or, in connection
with the Canadian Reserve Report, shall cause QRCI to) (a) furnish to the Global Administrative Agent the
Reserve Reports prepared by one or more Approved Petroleum Engineers (the “Prepared Reserve
Reports”) as of January 1st of such year. On or before October 1st of each year, commencing October 1,
2012, the Borrower shall (or, in connection with the Canadian Reserve Report, shall cause QRCI to)
furnish to the Global Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Canadian Lenders the Reserve Reports as
of July 1st of such year prepared by or under the supervision of the chief engineer of the Borrower in
accordance with the procedures used in the most recent Prepared Reserve Reports. It is understood that
projections concerning volumes attributable to the Oil and Gas Properties and production and cost
estimates contained in each Reserve Report are necessarily based upon professional opinions, estimates
and projections and that the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries do not warrant that such opinions,
estimates and projections will ultimately prove to have been accurate.
(b) In the event of an Interim Redetermination requested by the Global Administrative Agent or the
Borrower pursuant to Section 2.07(b), the Borrower shall (or, in connection with the Canadian Reserve
Report, shall cause QRCI to), upon the request of the Global Administrative Agent, furnish to the Global
Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Canadian Lenders the Reserve Reports (i) prepared by or
under the supervision of the chief engineer of the Borrower and in accordance with the procedures used in
the immediately preceding Prepared Reserve Reports delivered pursuant to Section 8.11(a), and (ii) which
shall have an “as of” date as required by the Global Administrative Agent, no later than a date mutually
agreed to by the Borrower or QRCI, as applicable, and the Global Administrative Agent. If the Global
Administrative Agent does not request updated Reserve Reports pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence, the Global Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Canadian Lenders may base such Interim
Redetermination on the Reserve Reports most recently delivered by the Borrower or QRCI, as applicable,
hereunder.
(c) With the delivery of each Reserve Report, the Borrower shall (or, in connection with the Canadian
Reserve Report, shall cause QRCI to) provide to the Global Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the
Canadian Lenders a certificate from a Responsible Officer of the Borrower or QRCI, as applicable,
certifying that in all material respects: (i) the information contained in the Reserve Reports and any other
information delivered in connection therewith are true and correct, (ii) subject to Immaterial Title
Deficiencies, (x) the Borrower or a U.S. Guarantor owns good and defensible title to the Oil and Gas
Properties located in the United States evaluated in the applicable U.S. Reserve Report and such
Properties are free of all Liens except for Permitted Liens and Liens securing the Secured Indebtedness
and (y) QRCI or a
94
Canadian Guarantor owns good and defensible title to the Oil and Gas Properties located in Canada
evaluated in the applicable Canadian Reserve Report and such Properties are free of all Liens except for
Permitted Liens and Liens securing the Canadian Secured Indebtedness, (iii) except as set forth on an
exhibit to the certificate, on a net basis there are no gas imbalances, take or pay or other prepayments in
excess of one half bcf of gas in the aggregate (x) with respect to its Oil and Gas Properties located in the
United States evaluated in the applicable U.S. Reserve Report which would require the Borrower or any
U.S. Guarantor to deliver Hydrocarbons either generally or produced from such Oil and Gas Properties at
some future time without then or thereafter receiving full payment therefor and (y) with respect to its Oil and
Gas Properties located in Canada evaluated in the applicable Canadian Reserve Report which would
require QRCI or any Canadian Guarantor to deliver Hydrocarbons either generally or produced from such
Oil and Gas Properties at some future time without then or thereafter receiving full payment therefor,
(iv) attached to the certificate is a list of all marketing agreements entered into subsequent to the later of
the date hereof or the most recently delivered Reserve Reports which pertain to the sale of production at a
fixed price and have a maturity date of longer than six (6) months from the date of such certificate, and (v) a
true and complete list of all Oil and Gas Swap Agreements of the Borrower and each Restricted Subsidiary
is included, which list contains the material terms thereof (including the type, remaining term, counterparty,
mark-to-market value as of the end of the second month immediately preceding the date of such certificate
and notional amounts or volumes), any credit support agreements relating thereto, any margin required or
supplied under any credit support document, and the counterparty to each such agreement.
(d) The Canadian Reserve Reports may only include Oil and Gas Properties that are (x) located in British
Columbia, Canada, Alberta, Canada, or another province in Canada that at such time allows for a secured
lender to receive the benefit of a floating charge over real property located in such province, and for which
such floating charge is created by a debenture or other Security Instrument and is of record (as necessary)
as contemplated under Section 6.01(f)(i) of the Existing Canadian Credit Agreement or (y) located in any
other province in Canada, the United States or any other country or jurisdiction reasonably acceptable to
the Global Administrative Agent; provided that with respect to Oil and Gas Properties set forth in this
clause (y), (i) the Global Administrative Agent shall be reasonably satisfied that fixed charges, collateral
agreements or other Canadian Security Instruments create first priority, perfected Liens (subject only to
Permitted Liens) on at least 80% of the total value of the Proved Hydrocarbon Interests relating to such Oil
and Gas Properties and (ii) the Global Administrative Agent shall have received title information as the
Global Administrative Agent may reasonably require satisfactory to the Global Administrative Agent setting
forth the status of title to at least 75% of the total value of such Oil and Gas Properties; provided, that with
respect to such Oil and Gas Properties referred to in the foregoing clauses (x) and (y), the Global
Administrative Agent shall have received such other closing documents, certificates, and legal opinions as
shall be reasonably requested by, and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to, the Global
Administrative Agent.
Section 8.12 Title Information. (a) On or before the date that is 45 days following the delivery to the Global
Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Canadian Lenders of each Reserve Report required by
Section 8.11(a), the Borrower will (or, in connection with the Canadian Reserve Report dealing with
property described in Section 8.11(d)(y) (the “Canadian Reserve Report Affected Property”), shall cause
QRCI to) deliver title information in form and
95
substance reasonably acceptable to the Global Administrative Agent covering enough of the Oil and Gas
Properties evaluated by the U.S. Reserve Report and the Canadian Reserve Report dealing with
Canadian Reserve Report Affected Property that were not included in such immediately preceding
Reserve Report, so that the Global Administrative Agent shall have received together with title information
previously delivered to the Global Administrative Agent, satisfactory title information on at least 75% of the
total value of the Proved Hydrocarbon Interests evaluated by such Reserve Report.
(b) If the Borrower has provided (or, in connection with the Canadian Reserve Report Affected Property,
has caused QRCI to provide) title information for additional Oil and Gas Properties under Section 8.12(a),
the Borrower shall (or, in connection with the Canadian Reserve Report Affected Property, shall cause
QRCI to), within 60 days of notice from the Global Administrative Agent that title defects or exceptions exist
with respect to such additional Properties (or such longer period as the applicable Administrative Agent
may agree in its discretion), either (i) cure any such title defects or exceptions raised by such information
(including defects or exceptions as to priority) which are not permitted by Section 9.03, (ii) substitute
acceptable Oil and Gas Properties with no title defects or exceptions except for Permitted Liens
having an equivalent value or (iii) deliver title information in form and substance acceptable to the
Global Administrative Agent so that the Global Administrative Agent shall have received, together
with title information previously delivered to the Global Administrative Agent, satisfactory title
information on at least 75% of the value of the Proved Hydrocarbon Interests evaluated by the
applicable Reserve Report. For purposes of this Section 8.12(b), the Global Administrative Agent
must deliver any notice of title defects or exceptions with respect to any Oil and Gas Properties
within 60 days following the Global Administrative Agent’s receipt of title information for such Oil
and Gas Properties.
(c) If the Borrower is unable to (or, in connection with the Canadian Reserve Report Affected
Property, is unable to cause QRCI to) cure any title defect requested by the Global Administrative
Agent, the Lenders or the Canadian Lenders to be cured within the 60-day period (or such longer
period as the applicable Administrative Agent may agree in its discretion) or the Borrower does not
(or, in connection with the Canadian Reserve Report Affected Property, does not cause QRCI to)
comply with the requirements to provide acceptable title information covering 75% of the value of
the Proved Hydrocarbon Interests evaluated in each most recent Reserve Report, such default
shall not be a Default, but instead the Global Administrative Agent, at the direction of (x) the
Required U.S. Lenders, with respect to the most recent U.S. Reserve Report, and (y) the Canadian
Required Lenders, with respect to the Canadian Reserve Report Affected Property most recent
Canadian Reserve Report, shall have the right to exercise the following remedy in their sole
discretion from time to time, and any failure to so exercise this remedy at any time shall not be a
waiver as to future exercise of the remedy by the Global Administrative Agent, the Lenders or the
Canadian Lenders. To the extent that the Global Administrative Agent is not reasonably satisfied
with title to any Oil and Gas Property included in such Reserve Report after the 60-day period (or
such longer period as the applicable Administrative Agent may agree in its discretion) has elapsed,
such unacceptable Oil and Gas Property shall not count towards the 75% requirement, and the
Global Administrative Agent may send a notice to the Borrower and the Lenders and the Canadian
Lenders that the then outstanding Global Borrowing Base (and to the extent such Oil and Gas
Property is included in the most recent U.S. Reserve Report, U.S. Borrowing Base) shall be
reduced by an amount as
96
determined by the Required Lenders to cause the Borrower and/or QRCI to be in compliance with
the requirement to provide acceptable title information on 75% of the value of the Proved
Hydrocarbon Interests. This new Global Borrowing Base (and to the extent such Oil and Gas
Property is included in the most recent U.S. Reserve Report, U.S. Borrowing Base) shall become
effective immediately after receipt of such notice by the Borrower.
Section 8.13 Additional Collateral; Additional Guarantors; Release of Certain Guarantors/Collateral.
(a) In connection with each redetermination of the Global Borrowing Base, the Borrower shall (or, in
connection with the Canadian Reserve Report, shall cause QRCI to) review each most recently
completed Reserve Report and the list of current Mortgaged Properties to ascertain whether the
Mortgaged Properties:
(x) located in British Columbia, Canada, Alberta, Canada, or another province in Canada that at
such time allows for a secured lender to receive the benefit of a floating charge over real property
located in such province are subject to a floating charge or a security interest created by a
debenture or other Security Instrument, which is of record (as necessary) and that creates a first
priority, perfected Lien taken by way of a floating charge or a security interest (subject only to
Permitted Liens) on all of the total value of the Proved Hydrocarbons Interests of the Borrower and
the Guarantors (subject to de minimus exceptions), or
(y) located in any other province in Canada, the United States or any other country or jurisdiction
reasonably acceptable to the Global Administrative Agent are subject to fixed charges, collateral
agreements or other Security Instruments, which create first priority, perfected Liens (subject only
to Permitted Liens) on at least 80% of the total value of the Proved Hydrocarbon Interests evaluated
in such Reserve Report, after giving effect to exploration and production activities, acquisitions,
dispositions and production, that are found in such locations.
In the event that the Mortgaged Properties do not satisfy clauses (x) and (y), then the Borrower
shall, and shall cause its Restricted Subsidiaries to, grant, within 30 days of the delivery of the
certificate required under Section 8.11(c) (or such longer period as the applicable Administrative
Agent may agree in its discretion), to the Global Administrative Agent as security for the Combined
Obligations or to the Canadian Administrative Agent as security for the Canadian Secured
Indebtedness, as applicable, a first-priority Lien interest (taken by way of a floating charge over real
property or otherwise) (provided that Permitted Liens may exist) on additional Oil and Gas
Properties evaluated in such Reserve Report containing Proved Hydrocarbon Interests not already
subject to a Lien of the Security Instruments or the Canadian Security Instruments, as applicable,
such that after giving effect thereto, each of clause (x) and (y) will be satisfied. All such Liens will be
created and perfected by and in accordance with the provisions of deeds of trust, security
agreements and financing statements or other Security Instruments or other Canadian Security
Interests, as applicable, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the applicable
Administrative Agent and in sufficient executed (and acknowledged where necessary or
appropriate) counterparts for recording purposes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, if any Restricted Subsidiary places a Lien on its Oil and Gas
Properties to secure the Secured Indebtedness or the Canadian Secured Indebtedness, as
applicable, and such Restricted Subsidiary is not a Guarantor, then it shall become a Guarantor
and comply with Section 8.13(c).
(b)
97
(i) If the Borrower or any Domestic Subsidiary becomes the owner of a Restricted Subsidiary, then
the Borrower shall, or shall cause such Domestic Subsidiary to, promptly, but in any event no later
than 30 days after the date of becoming an owner thereof (or such longer period as the Global
Administrative Agent may agree in its discretion), (A) pledge (x) 100% of the Equity Interests of
such new Restricted Subsidiary if such Subsidiary is a Domestic Subsidiary or (y) 65% of the total
combined voting power of all classes of Equity Interests (and the remaining 35% under a Canadian
Security Agreement to secure the Canadian Secured Indebtedness if requested by the
administrative agent under the Canadian Credit Agreement in the case of Canadian Subsidiaries)
and 100% of all non-voting Equity Interests of such new Restricted Subsidiary, if such new
Restricted Subsidiary is a Foreign Subsidiary (including, without limitation, delivery of original
stock certificates evidencing the Equity Interests of such new Restricted Subsidiary, together with
appropriate undated stock powers for each certificate duly executed in blank by the registered
owner thereof) and (B) execute and deliver such other additional closing documents, certificates
and legal opinions as shall reasonably be requested by the Global Administrative Agent.
(ii) If any Canadian Subsidiary becomes the owner of a Restricted Subsidiary, then the Borrower
shall (or shall cause QRCI to) cause such Canadian Subsidiary to, promptly, but in any event no
later than 30 days after the date of becoming an owner thereof (or such longer period as the
Canadian Administrative Agent may agree in its discretion), (A) pledge 100% of the Equity Interests
of such new Restricted Subsidiary (including, without limitation, delivery of original stock
certificates evidencing the Equity Interests of such new Restricted Subsidiary, together with
appropriate undated stock powers for each certificate duly executed in blank by the registered
owner thereof) and (B) execute and deliver such other additional closing documents, certificates
and legal opinions as shall reasonably be requested by the Canadian Administrative Agent.
(b) The Borrower shall cause the following Persons to guarantee the Secured Indebtedness
pursuant to the Guaranty Agreement:
(i)
(A) each Material Restricted Subsidiary;
(B) any Person required to guarantee the Secured Indebtedness in order for the Borrower to be in
compliance with Section 9.05(b);
(C) any Person that guarantees any Existing Debt or any U.S. Permitted Additional Debt;
(D) any Restricted Subsidiary that places a Lien as required by the last sentence of Section 8.13(a)
on its Oil and Gas Properties to secure the Secured Indebtedness; and
98
(E) one or more additional Domestic Subsidiaries to the extent necessary to cause (1) the total
assets of the Domestic Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors to be less than 15% of the combined
assets of the Borrower and its Domestic Subsidiaries and (2) the combined EBITDAX of such
Domestic Subsidiaries to be less than 15% of the combined EBITDAX of the Borrower and its
Domestic Subsidiaries.
(ii) The Borrower shall, and shall cause the following Persons to, guarantee the Canadian Secured
Indebtedness pursuant to the Canadian Guaranty Agreement:
(A) each U.S. Guarantor;
(B) each Canadian Material Restricted Subsidiary;
(C) any Person required to guarantee the Canadian Secured Indebtedness in order for QRCI to be
in compliance with Section 9.05(b) of the Canadian Credit Agreement;
(D) any Person that guarantees any Canadian Permitted Additional Debt;
(E) any Restricted Subsidiary that places a Lien as required by the last sentence of Section 8.13(a)
of the Canadian Credit Agreement on its Oil and Gas Properties to secure the Canadian Secured
Indebtedness; and
(F) one or more additional Canadian Subsidiaries (other than QRCI) to the extent necessary to
cause (1) the total assets of the Canadian Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors (other than QRCI) to
be less than 15% of the combined assets of the Canadian Subsidiaries and (2) the combined
EBITDAX of such Canadian Subsidiaries to be less than 15% of the combined EBITDAX of the
Canadian Subsidiaries.
(c) In connection with any guaranty required by Section 8.13(c), the Borrower shall, or shall cause
such Subsidiary or other Person to promptly, but in any event no later than 30 days (or such longer
period as the applicable Administrative Agent may agree in its discretion) after the event requiring
such guaranty, execute and deliver (i) a supplement to the Guaranty Agreement or the Canadian
Guaranty Agreement, as applicable, and (ii) such other additional closing documents, certificates
and legal opinions as shall reasonably be requested by the applicable Administrative Agent. If at
any time any Person is not otherwise required to guarantee the Secured Indebtedness or the
Canadian Secured Indebtedness, as applicable, hereunder (whether pursuant to the other
provisions of this Section 8.13 or otherwise) or under any other Loan Document or any other

9.06(j), (p) or (q). The Borrower hereby notifies the Global Administrative Agent and the Lenders
that upon the contribution of the Equity Interests of MLP Opco to MLP, MLP Opco shall become an
Unrestricted Subsidiary.
(c) The Borrower may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if after

acceptable to the Global Administrative Agent.
Section 9.09 Mergers, Etc. The Borrower will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to,
merge into or with or consolidate with any other Person, or sell, lease or otherwise dispose of
(whether in one transaction or in a series of transactions) all or substantially all of its Property to
any other Person (whether now owned or hereafter acquired) any such transaction, a
“consolidation”), or liquidate or dissolve; provided that
(a) any Restricted Subsidiary may (i) participate in a consolidation with (A) the Borrower (provided
that the Borrower shall be the continuing or surviving corporation), (B) any other Restricted
Subsidiary (provided that if a Guarantor is a party to such transaction, the survivor is a Guarantor
or becomes a party to the Guaranty Agreement or Canadian Guaranty Agreement, as applicable, as
a Guarantor) or (C) any other Subsidiary (provided that either (x) a Restricted Subsidiary shall be
the continuing or surviving Person or (y) if an Unrestricted Subsidiary is the continuing or
surviving Person, (1) the representations and warranties of the Borrower and its Restricted
Subsidiaries contained in each of the Loan Documents are true and correct on and as of such date
as if made on and as of the date of such consolidation (or, if stated to have been made expressly as

Deficiency would exist and (3) the Borrower is in compliance with the requirements of Section 8.13

becomes a party to the Guaranty Agreement or Canadian Guaranty Agreement, as applicable, as a
Guarantor;
(b) the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary may participate in a consolidation (other than as
described in clause (a) above) if, at the time thereof and immediately after giving effect thereto, no
Default shall occur and be continuing and no Global Borrowing Base Deficiency would result
therefrom and, the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is the surviving
entity or the recipient of any such sale, lease or other disposition of Property, provided that no
such consolidation shall have the effect of releasing the Borrower, QRCI or any Guarantor from any
of its obligations under this Agreement, the Canadian Credit Agreement or any other Loan
Document or Canadian Loan Document;
(c) any sale of all or substantially all of the assets of any Restricted Subsidiary provided that such
sale is permitted by Section 9.10 or such sale is in connection with the Barnett Shale Transaction;
and

of such Restricted Subsidiary is no longer in the best interests of the Borrower and its Restricted
Subsidiaries taken as a whole (as reasonably determined by a Responsible Officer of the
Borrower), (ii) such liquidation and dissolution is not disadvantageous in any material respect to
the Lenders, and (iii) at the time thereof and immediately after giving effect thereto, no Default shall
occur and be continuing and no Global Borrowing Base Deficiency would result therefrom.
112
Section 9.10 Sale of Properties and Termination of Oil and Gas Swap Agreements. The Borrower
will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, sell, assign, farm-out, convey or otherwise
transfer (including by way of a Reclassification) any Oil and Gas Property evaluated in the Reserve
Reports used in the most recent determination of the Global Borrowing Base or any interest therein
or any Restricted Subsidiary owning any such Oil and Gas Property or terminate, unwind, cancel or
otherwise dispose of any Oil and Gas Swap Agreement except for:
(a) the sale of Hydrocarbons in the ordinary course of business;
(b) farmouts of undeveloped acreage and assignments in connection with such farmouts or the
abandonment, farm-out, exchange, lease, sublease or other disposition of Oil and Gas Properties
not containing Proved Hydrocarbon Interests which were not evaluated in the Reserve Reports
used in the most recent determination of the Global Borrowing Base in the ordinary cause of
business;
(c) the sale or transfer of equipment or other assets that are no longer necessary or useful or are
obsolete for the business of the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary or are replaced by
equipment or other assets usable in the ordinary course of business, of at least comparable value;
(d) the sale or other disposition (including Casualty Events and Reclassifications) of such Oil and
Gas Property or any interest therein (excluding the MLP Barnett Shale Assets) or any Restricted
Subsidiary owning such Oil and Gas Property or the termination, unwinding, cancelation or other
disposition of Oil and Gas Swap Agreements (excluding the MLP Barnett Shale Assets); provided
that:
(i) except in the case of a Reclassification, the consideration received in respect of such sale or
other disposition shall be equal to or greater than the fair market value of the Oil and Gas Property
(other than in the case of a Casualty Event), interest therein or Restricted Subsidiary subject of
such sale or other disposition (as reasonably determined by any Responsible Officer of the
Borrower);
(ii) no Event of Default or Global Borrowing Base Deficiency exists or results from such
termination, unwind, cancellation, sale or disposition (including any Casualty Event or
Reclassification);
(iii) if during any period between two successive Redetermination Dates the aggregate amount of
(A) the net cash proceeds received by the Borrower, directly, or indirectly, from the termination,
unwind, cancelation or other disposition of such Oil and Gas Swap Agreements plus (B) the
Recognized Value of such Oil and Gas Properties sold or disposed of (including by way of
Casualty Events and Reclassifications) exceeds five percent (5%) of the Global Borrowing Base in
effect during such period, then the Global Borrowing Base (and to the extent such Oil and Gas
Properties were included in the most recent U.S. Reserve Report, U.S. Borrowing Base) shall be
automatically
113
reduced, effective immediately upon such termination, unwind, cancellation, sale or disposition
(including any Casualty Event or Reclassification) by the amount that (x) aggregate value that the
Global Administrative Agent attributed to such Oil and Gas Swap Agreements and Oil and Gas
Properties in connection with the most recent determination of the Global Borrowing Base exceeds
(y) five percent (5%) of the Global Borrowing Base in effect immediately prior to such
redetermination, and the Global Borrowing Base (and, if applicable, U.S. Borrowing Base) as so
reduced shall become the new Global Borrowing Base (and, if applicable, U.S. Borrowing Base)
immediately upon the date of such termination, unwind, cancellation, sale or disposition (including
Casualty Events and Reclassifications), effective and applicable to the Borrower, the Global
Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and the Lenders on such date until the next
redetermination or modification thereof hereunder;
(iv) if such termination, unwind, cancellation, sale or disposition (including Reclassifications, but
excluding Casualty Events) would result in an automatic redetermination of the Global Borrowing
Base pursuant to this Section 9.10, the Borrower or QRCI, as applicable, shall have delivered
reasonable prior written notice thereof to the Global Administrative Agent;
(v) if a Global Borrowing Base Deficiency would result from such termination, unwind, cancellation,
sale or disposition (including Reclassifications but excluding Casualty Events) as a result of an
automatic redetermination of the Global Borrowing Base or U.S. Borrowing Base pursuant to this
Section 9.10, (x) the Borrower (in the case of a redetermination of U.S. Borrowing Base) prepays
Borrowings and/or (y) the Borrower and QRCI (in the case of a redetermination of the Global
Borrowing Base) prepay Borrowings or Canadian Borrowings, as applicable, prior to or
contemporaneously with the consummation of such termination, unwind, cancellation, sale or
disposition (including Reclassifications but excluding Casualty Events), to the extent that such
prepayment would have been required under Section 3.04(c)(iii) (without giving effect to any 30-day
period for payment contained therein) after giving effect to such automatic redetermination of the
Global Borrowing Base and/or U.S. Borrowing Base; and
(vi) if a Global Borrowing Base Deficiency would directly result from a Casualty Event as a result of
an automatic redetermination of the Global Borrowing Base or the U.S. Borrowing Base pursuant
to this Section 9.10, Section 3.04(c)(ii) shall apply.
For purposes of this clause (d), such five percent (5%) shall be determined without giving effect to
any asset swaps of Oil and Gas Properties evaluated in the Reserve Reports used in the most
recent determination of the Global Borrowing Base for other Oil and Gas Properties of equal or
greater Recognized Value;
(e) the sale of Oil and Gas Properties in connection with tax credit transactions complying with §29
of the Code or any other analogous provision of the Code or of Canadian tax law whether now
existing or hereafter enacted, which sale does not result in a reduction in the right of the Borrower
or any Restricted Subsidiary to receive the cash flow from such Oil and Gas Properties and which
sale is on terms reasonably acceptable to the Global Administrative Agent;
114
(f) transfers and other dispositions among the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries subject to
compliance with Section 8.13;
(g) transfers permitted by Section 9.09;
(h) transfer or assignment of the Existing Midstream Assets as contemplated by the Midstream
Joint Venture; and

contemplated by the Barnett Shale Transaction; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
contribution of the Equity Interests of MLP Opco to MLP is consummated prior to delivery by the
Global Administrative Agent of the Proposed Borrowing Base Notice relating to the Scheduled
Redetermination of the Global Borrowing Base and U.S. Borrowing Base in May 2012, then each of
the Global Borrowing Base and U.S. Borrowing Base will be reduced by $200,000,000; provided
further that if the cash proceeds of the Barnett Shale Transaction are not applied by the Borrower
within 45 days of the consummation thereof to repay, repurchase (including. without limitation,
through a tender offer) or retire at least $300,000,000 of principal amount of Existing Debt of the
Borrower, the Global Borrowing Base and U.S. Borrowing Base will each be reduced by an
additional $75,000,000.
Section 9.11 Transactions with Affiliates. The Borrower will not, and will not permit any Restricted
Subsidiary to, enter into any transaction, including, without limitation, any purchase, sale, lease or
exchange of Property or the rendering of any service, with any Affiliate (other than the Guarantors),
unless such transactions are not otherwise prohibited under this Agreement and are upon fair and
reasonable terms no less favorable to it than it would obtain in a comparable arm’s length
transaction with a Person not an Affiliate; provided that any transaction with any Affiliate as
contemplated by the Midstream Joint Venture (including the ongoing transactions contemplated
thereunder) and the Barnett Shale Transaction (including the ongoing transactions contemplated
thereunder) shall be permitted.
Section 9.12 Negative Pledge Agreements; Dividend Restrictions. The Borrower will not, and will
not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any contract,
agreement or understanding which in any way prohibits or restricts the granting, conveying,
creation or imposition of any Lien on any of its Oil and Gas Property or its Equity Interests in
Restricted Subsidiaries in favor of the Administrative Agents, the Secured Parties and the
Canadian Secured Parties or restricts any Restricted Subsidiary from paying dividends or making
distributions to the Borrower or any Guarantor, or which requires the consent of or notice to other
Persons in connection therewith; provided, however, that the preceding restrictions will not apply
to encumbrances or restrictions arising under or by reason of (a) this Agreement or the Security
Instruments, (b) Debt permitted by Section 9.02 secured by Liens permitted by Section 9.03
(subject to the penultimate sentence thereof and only to the extent related to the Property on which
such Liens were created), or any contract, agreement or understanding creating Liens permitted by
Section 9.03 (subject to the penultimate sentence thereof and only to the extent related to the
Property on which such Liens were created), (c) any leases or licenses or similar contracts as they
affect any Oil and Gas Property or Lien subject to a lease or license, (d) any restriction with respect
to a Restricted Subsidiary imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect
sale or disposition of all or substantially all the
115
equity or Oil and Gas Property of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the Oil and Gas Property that is
subject to such restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition, or (e) customary
provisions with respect to the distribution of Oil and Gas Property in joint venture agreements.
Section 9.13 Swap Agreements. The Borrower will not, nor will the Borrower permit any Restricted
Subsidiary to, enter into any new Oil and Gas Swap Agreements which would cause the volume of
Hydrocarbons with respect to which a settlement payment is calculated under all Oil and Gas Swap
Agreements (including such new transactions) to which the Borrower and/or any Restricted
Subsidiary is a party as of the date such Oil and Gas Swap Agreements are entered into to exceed
(a) (i) for the calendar year in which such new Oil and Gas Swap Agreements are entered into (the
“Initial Measurement Period”), eighty-five percent (85%) of the aggregate of the Borrower’s and its
Restricted Subsidiaries’ anticipated production from Proved Hydrocarbon Interests for each of oil
and gas (including natural gas liquids), calculated separately, (ii) for the calendar year immediately
following the end of the Initial Measurement Period (the “Second Measurement Period”), eighty
percent (80%) of the aggregate of the Borrower’s and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ anticipated
production from Proved Hydrocarbon Interests for each of oil and gas (including natural gas
liquids), calculated separately, (iii) for the calendar year immediately following the end of the
Second Measurement Period (the “Third Measurement Period”), seventy-five percent (75%) of the
aggregate of the Borrower’s and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ anticipated production from Proved
Hydrocarbon Interests for each of oil and gas (including natural gas liquids), calculated separately
and (iv) for the calendar year immediately following the end of the Third Measurement Period and
for each calendar year thereafter, one hundred percent (100%) of the aggregate of the Borrower’s
and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ anticipated production from Proved Producing Hydrocarbon
Interests for each of oil and gas (including natural gas liquids), calculated separately, plus, in each
case, (b) an amount not to exceed one hundred percent (100%) of associated royalty owners’ oil,
gas and/or natural gas liquids produced from the same wells, and which oil, gas and/or natural gas
liquids the Borrower has the authority to market and sell, during the applicable measurement
period; provided that the Borrower will not, nor will the Borrower permit any Restricted Subsidiary
to, permit its production from Proved Producing Hydrocarbon Interests (whether or not included or
reflected in the most recent Reserve Reports delivered to the Global Administrative Agent and the
Lenders pursuant to Section 8.11) during the then current month to be less than the aggregate
amount of production from Proved Producing Hydrocarbon Interests which are subject to Oil and
Gas Swap Agreements during such month; provided further that the Borrower will not, nor will the
Borrower permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, (x) enter into any Oil and Gas Swap Agreements
except in the ordinary course of business (and not for speculative purposes), (y) enter into any
Swap Agreement for speculative purposes or with a counterparty that is not an Approved
Counterparty or (z) terminate, unwind, cancel or otherwise dispose of any Oil and Gas Swap

Default”:

Section 10.02 Remedies. (a) In the case of an Event of Default other than one described in
Section 10.01(h), Section 10.01(i) or Section 10.01(j), at any time thereafter during the continuance
of such Event of Default, the Global Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the Majority

different times: (i) terminate the Commitments, and thereupon the Commitments shall terminate
immediately, and (ii) declare the Notes and the Loans then outstanding to be due and payable in

ARTICLE 11
THE AGENTS
Section 11.01 Appointment; Powers. Each of the Lenders and each Issuing Bank hereby
irrevocably appoints the Global Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Global
Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are
delegated to the Global Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and the other Loan Documents,
together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
Section 11.02 Duties and Obligations of Global Administrative Agent. The Global Administrative
Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan
Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Global Administrative Agent
shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has
occurred and is continuing (the use of the term “agent” herein and in the other Loan Documents
with reference to the Global Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other
implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law; rather, such
term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is
120
intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting
parties), (b) the Global Administrative Agent shall have no duty to take any discretionary action or
exercise any discretionary powers, except as provided in Section 11.03, and (c) except as
expressly set forth herein, the Global Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and
shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Global Administrative
Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Global Administrative Agent shall be deemed not
to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Global
Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and shall not be responsible for or have any
duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in
connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate,
report or other document delivered hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in connection
herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or
other terms or conditions set forth herein or in any other Loan Document, (iv) the validity,
enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any
other agreement, instrument or document, (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in ARTICLE
6 or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to
the Global Administrative Agent or those conditions precedent expressly required to be to the
Global Administrative Agent’s satisfaction, (vi) the existence, value, perfection or priority of any
collateral security or the financial or other condition of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries or any
other obligor or guarantor, or (vii) any failure by the Borrower or any other Person (other than itself)
to perform any of its obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document or the performance
or observance of any covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or
therein. For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in ARTICLE 6, each
Lender shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each
document or other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or
satisfactory to a Lender unless the Global Administrative Agent shall have received written notice
from such Lender prior to the proposed closing date specifying its objection thereto.
Section 11.03 Action by Global Administrative Agent. The Global Administrative Agent shall have
no duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary
rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Global
Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Majority Lenders, the
Required U.S. Lenders or the Lenders, as applicable (or such other number or percentage of the
Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 12.02) and in all
cases the Global Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder
or under any other Loan Documents unless it shall (a) receive written instructions from the Majority
Lenders, the Required Lenders or the Lenders, as applicable, (or such other number or percentage
of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 12.02)
specifying the action to be taken and (b) be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against
any and all liability and expenses which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to
take any such action. The instructions as aforesaid and any action taken or failure to act pursuant
thereto by the Global Administrative Agent shall be binding on all of the Lenders. If a Default has
occurred and is continuing, then the Global Administrative Agent shall take such action with
respect to such Default as shall be directed by the requisite Lenders in the written instructions
(with indemnities) described in this
121
Section 11.03, provided that, unless and until the Global Administrative Agent shall have received
such directions, the Global Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such
action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable in
the best interests of the Lenders. In no event, however, shall the Global Administrative Agent be
required to take any action which exposes the Global Administrative Agent to personal liability or
which is contrary to this Agreement, the Loan Documents or applicable law. If a Default has
occurred and is continuing, neither the Syndication Agent nor the Co-Documentation Agents shall
have any obligation to perform any act in respect thereof. The Global Administrative Agent shall
not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Majority
Lenders or the Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary
under the circumstances as provided in Section 12.02), and otherwise the Global Administrative
Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in its capacity as the Global
Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document or under any other document
or instrument referred to or provided for herein or therein or in connection herewith or therewith
INCLUDING ITS OWN ORDINARY NEGLIGENCE, except for its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct.
Section 11.04 Reliance by Global Administrative Agent. The Global Administrative Agent shall be
entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request,
certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine
and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Global Administrative Agent also may
rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the
proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon and each of the Borrower, the
Lenders and each Issuing Bank hereby waives the right to dispute the Global Administrative
Agent’s record of such statement, except in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct by
the Global Administrative Agent. The Global Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel
(who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it,
and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any
such counsel, accountants or experts. The Global Administrative Agent may deem and treat the
payee of any Note as the holder thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until a written notice of
the assignment or transfer thereof permitted hereunder shall have been filed with the Global
Administrative Agent.
Section 11.05 Subagents. The Global Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties
and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the
Global Administrative Agent. The Global Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may
perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related
Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding Sections of this ARTICLE 11 shall apply to
any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Global Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the
credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Global Administrative Agent.
Section 11.06 Resignation of Global Administrative Agent. Subject to the appointment and
acceptance of a successor Global Administrative Agent as provided in this Section 11.06, the
Global Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, each Issuing Bank
and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Majority Lenders shall have the right, in
122
consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so
appointed by the Majority Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty
(30) days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on
behalf of the Lenders and each Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Agent which shall be a bank
with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its
appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become
vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent
shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to
a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed
between the Borrower and such successor. After the Agent’s resignation hereunder, the
provisions of this ARTICLE 11 and Section 12.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such
retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Agent.
Section 11.07 Agents as Lenders. Each bank serving as an Agent hereunder shall have the same
rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as
though it were not an Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend
money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or
other Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Agent hereunder.
Section 11.08 No Reliance. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Global Administrative Agent, any other Agent or any other Lender and based on
such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement and each other Loan Document to which it is a party. Each
Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Global
Administrative Agent, any other Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in
taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document, any
related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. The Agents shall not be
required to keep themselves informed as to the performance or observance by the Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Loan Documents or any other document referred to or
provided for herein or to inspect the Properties or books of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries.
Except for notices, reports and other documents and information expressly required to be
furnished to the Lenders by the Global Administrative Agent hereunder, no Agent or Arranger shall
have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information
concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of the Borrower (or any of its Affiliates)
which may come into the possession of such Agent or any of its Affiliates. In this regard, each
Lender acknowledges that Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP is acting in this transaction as special
counsel to the Global Administrative Agent only, except to the extent otherwise expressly stated in
any legal opinion or any Loan Document. Each other party hereto will consult with its own legal
counsel to the extent that it deems necessary in connection with the Loan Documents and the
matters contemplated therein.
123
Section 11.09 Global Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the pendency of any
receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment,
composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, the
Global Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due
and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the
Global Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and
empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:
(a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in
respect of the Loans and all other Secured Indebtedness that are owing and unpaid and to file
such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the
Lenders and the Global Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Global
Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the
Lenders and the Global Administrative Agent under Section 12.03) allowed in such judicial
proceeding; and
(b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims
and to distribute the same;
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in
any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the
Global Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Global Administrative Agent shall consent to
the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Global Administrative Agent any
amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Global Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Global
Administrative Agent under Section 12.03.
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Global Administrative Agent to
authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization,
arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Secured Indebtedness or the rights of any
Lender or to authorize the Global Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender
in any such proceeding.
Section 11.10 Authority Of Global Administrative Agent To Release Collateral And Liens. Each
Lender, Canadian Lender, Issuing Bank and Canadian Issuing Bank hereby or by agreeing to be
bound to the Intercreditor Agreement, authorizes the Global Administrative Agent to release or
subordinate any Oil and Gas Property (other than, in the case of any such subordination, any Oil
and Gas Property of the type described in clauses (a), (b), (c), (e) and (f) of the definition thereof
evaluated in the Reserve Reports used in the most recent determination of the Borrowing Base) or
other collateral that is permitted to be sold, Reclassified or released or be subject to a Lien
pursuant to the terms of the Loan Documents. Each Lender, Canadian Lender, Issuing Bank and
Canadian Issuing Bank hereby or by agreeing to be bound to the Intercreditor Agreement,
authorizes the Global Administrative Agent to execute and deliver to the Borrower, at the
Borrower’s sole cost and expense, any and all releases of Liens, termination statements,
assignments or other documents reasonably requested by the Borrower in connection with any
sale, Reclassification or other disposition of Oil or Gas Property to the extent such sale,
Reclassification or other disposition is permitted by the terms of Section 9.10 or is otherwise
authorized by the terms of the Loan Documents.
Section 11.11 The Joint Lead Arrangers, Syndication Agent and Co-Documentation Agents. The
Joint Lead Arrangers, the Syndication Agent and the Co-Documentation Agents
124
shall have no duties, responsibilities or liabilities under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents other than their duties, responsibilities and liabilities in their capacity as Lenders
hereunder.

Section 12.02 Waivers; Amendments. (a) No failure on the part of any party hereto to exercise and
no delay in exercising, and no course of dealing with respect to, any right, power or privilege, or
any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right, power or privilege, under any
of the Loan Documents shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any right, power or privilege under any of the Loan Documents preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies of
the Global Administrative Agent, any other Agent, each Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder
and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or
remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be
effective unless the same shall be permitted by Section 12.02(b), and then such waiver or consent
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be
construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Global Administrative Agent, any
other Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at
the time.
(b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof nor any Security Instrument nor any provision
thereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in

decrease or maintain the U.S. Borrowing Base without the consent of Required U.S. Lenders or
modify Section 2.07 or 2.09 without the written consent of all of the Lenders (other than any
Defaulting Lender); provided that a Scheduled Redetermination may be postponed by the
Required Lenders;
(iii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest
thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, or reduce any other Secured Indebtedness
hereunder or under any other Loan Document, without the written consent of each Lender affected
thereby;
(iv) postpone the scheduled date of payment or prepayment of the principal amount of any Loan or
LC Disbursement (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include any mandatory prepayment
pursuant to Section 3.04(c)), or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or any other
Secured Indebtedness hereunder or under any other Loan Document, or reduce the amount of,
waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone or extend the Termination Date without the written
consent of each Lender affected thereby;

distribution who is adversely affected thereby;

written consent of each Lender (other than any Defaulting Lender);

(viii) change any of the provisions of this Section 12.02(b) or any other provision hereof specifying
the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or
under any other Loan Documents or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder or
any other Loan Documents, in each case to the extent that such provision specifies that all
Lenders (including Defaulting Lenders) must make any determination or grant any consent
hereunder or under any other Loan Documents, without the written consent of each Lender; or
(ix) change the definitions of “Required Lenders”, “Required U.S. Lenders”, “Super-majority
Lenders, “Super-majority U.S. Lender” “ or “Majority Lenders” or any other provisions hereof
specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights
hereunder or under any other Loan Documents or make any determination or grant any consent
hereunder or any other Loan Documents to the extent that such provision does not require the
approval or consent of a Defaulting Lender, in each case without the written consent of each
Lender (other than any Defaulting Lender);
provided, further, that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or
duties of the Global Administrative Agent, any other Agent, the Swingline Lender, or any Issuing
Bank hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the prior written consent of the Global
Administrative Agent, such other Agent, the Swingline Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case
may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any supplement to Schedule 7.11 (Subsidiaries) shall be

Global Administrative Agent a supplemental schedule clearly marked as such and, upon receipt,
the Global Administrative Agent will promptly deliver a copy thereof to the Lenders.

ARTICLE 9 or ARTICLE 10 to this Agreement or (y) any terms defined in this Agreement to the
extent that the amendment or modification of such terms would affect the operation of such
ARTICLES shall be effective without the corresponding amendment or modification to ARTICLE 7,
ARTICLE 8, ARTICLE 9 or ARTICLE 10 to the Canadian Credit Agreement or the corresponding
terms defined in the Canadian Credit Agreement.

restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit.

(c) To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to any Agent,
any Arranger, the Swingline Lender, or any Issuing Bank under Section 12.03(a) or (b), each Lender
severally agrees to pay to such Agent, such Arranger, the Swingline Lender, or such Issuing Bank,

and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of any Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit),
except that (i) the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or
transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may
assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this
Section 12.04. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon
any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted
hereby (including any Affiliate of any Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), Participants (to
the extent provided in Section 12.04(c)) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the
Related Parties of each of the Global Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank, the Swingline
Lender, and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this
Agreement.
(b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in Section 12.04(b)(ii), any Lender may assign to one or
more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a
portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld) of:
(A) the Borrower, provided that no consent of the Borrower shall be required if such assignment is
to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund or, if an Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, is to any other assignee; and
(B) the Global Administrative Agent, provided that no consent of the Global Administrative Agent
shall be required for an assignment to an assignee that is a Lender, Affiliate of a Lender or an
Approved Fund of a Lender immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment.
130
(ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions:
(A) except for an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s
Commitment or Loans, (1) in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender, the
amount of the unused Commitment and Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such
assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such
assignment is delivered to the Global Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $2,500,000 and
the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender after such assignment shall not
be less than $2,500,000 unless each of the Borrower and the Global Administrative Agent otherwise
consent, provided that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing and (2) in the case of an assignment to an assignee other than a Lender
or an Affiliate of a Lender, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject
to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect
to such assignment is delivered to the Global Administrative Agent) shall not be less than
$5,000,000 and the amount of the unused Commitment and Loans of the assigning Lender after
such assignment shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Borrower and the Global
Administrative Agent otherwise consent, provided that no such consent of the Borrower shall be
required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;
(B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the
assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement;
(C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Global Administrative Agent an
Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500;
(D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Global Administrative Agent an
Administrative Questionnaire;
(E) in no event may any Lender assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement to the Borrower or any Affiliate of the Borrower; and
(F) the assignee must not be a Defaulting Lender.
(iii) Subject to Section 12.04(b)(iv) and the acceptance and recording thereof, from and after the
effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a
party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have
the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder
shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from
its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering
all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease
to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Section 5.01, Section 5.02,
Section 5.03 and Section 12.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender
131
of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 12.04 shall be
treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights
and obligations in accordance with Section 12.04(c).
(iv) The Global Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall
maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a
register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Maximum Credit
Amount of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Global Administrative Agent, each Issuing
Bank and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to
the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice
to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, any Issuing Bank
and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. In
connection with any changes to the Register, if necessary, the Global Administrative Agent will
reflect the revisions on Annex I and forward a copy of such revised Annex I to the Borrower, each
Issuing Bank and each Lender.
(v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning
Lender and an assignee, the assignee’s completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the
assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in
Section 12.04(b) and any written consent to such assignment required by Section 12.04(b), the
Global Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the
information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this
Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this Section 12.04(b).
(c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the Global Administrative Agent, the
Swingline Lender or any Issuing Bank, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a
“Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such
Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain
solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the
Borrower, the Global Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall
continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and
obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells
such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this
Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not,
without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described
in the proviso to Section 12.02 that affects such Participant. In addition such agreement must
provide that the Participant be bound by the provisions of Section 12.03. Subject to Section
12.04(c)(ii), the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section
5.01, Section 5.02 and Section 5.03 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its
interest by assignment pursuant to Section 12.04(b). To the extent permitted by law, each
Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 12.08 as though it were a Lender,
provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 4.01(c) as though it were a Lender.
132
(ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 5.01 or Section
5.03 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation
sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the
Borrower’s prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender
shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 5.03 unless the Borrower is notified of the
participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower,
to comply with Section 5.03(e) as though it were a Lender.
(iii) Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary
agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each
participant and the principal amounts (and related interest amounts) of each participant’s interest
in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the “Participant Register”). The entries in
the Participant Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat
each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation
for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. No Lender shall
have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to the Borrower or any
other Person (including the identity of any participant or any information relating to a participant’s
interest in any obligations under any Loan Document) except to the extent that such disclosure is
necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in
registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Global Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Global Administrative
Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
(d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights
under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including, without limitation, any
pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or central bank, and this
Section 12.04(d) shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided
that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party
hereto.
(e) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 12.04, no transfer or assignment of the
interests or obligations of any Lender or any grant of participations therein shall be permitted if
such transfer, assignment or grant would require the Borrower and the Guarantors to file a
registration statement with the SEC or to qualify the Loans under the “Blue Sky” laws of any state.
Section 12.05 Survival; Revival; Reinstatement. (a) All covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties made by the Borrower herein and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in
connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to
have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall
133
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Loans and issuance of
any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf
and notwithstanding that the Global Administrative Agent, any other Agent, any Issuing Bank or
any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or any incorrect representation or
warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as
long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount
payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and
so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Section 5.01,
Section 5.02, Section 5.03 and Section 12.03 and ARTICLE 11 shall survive and remain in full force
and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments
or the termination of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any provision hereof or thereof.
(b) To the extent that any payments on the Secured Indebtedness or proceeds of any collateral are
subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be
repaid to a trustee, debtor in possession, receiver or other Person under any bankruptcy law,
common law or equitable cause, then to such extent, the Secured Indebtedness so satisfied shall
be revived and continue as if such payment or proceeds had not been received and the Global
Administrative Agent’s and the Lenders’ Liens, security interests, rights, powers and remedies
under this Agreement and each Loan Document shall continue in full force and effect. In such
event, each Loan Document shall be automatically reinstated and the Borrower shall take such
action as may be reasonably requested by the Global Administrative Agent and the Lenders to
effect such reinstatement.
Section 12.06 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. (a) This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall
constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.
(b) This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to
fees payable to the Agents and other matters constitute the entire contract among the parties
relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede any and all previous agreements
and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof. THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT
AMONG THE PARTIES HERETO AND THERETO AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY
EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE
PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES.
(c) Except as provided in Section 6.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have
been executed by the Global Administrative Agent and when the Global Administrative Agent shall
have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the
other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a
signature page of this Agreement by telecopy or electronic mail shall be effective as delivery of a
manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
134
Section 12.07 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the
extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof or thereof; and the invalidity of a particular
provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction. If it
becomes illegal for any Lender to hold or benefit from a Lien over real property pursuant to any
law, such Lender shall notify the Global Administrative Agent and disclaim any benefit of such
security interest to the extent of such illegality, but such illegality shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such Lien for the benefit of each of the other Lenders.
Section 12.08 Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each
Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or
demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations (of whatsoever kind, including,
without limitation, obligations under Swap Agreements) at any time owing by such Lender or
Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary against any
of and all the obligations of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary owed to such Lender now or
hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, irrespective of whether or
not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document
and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section
12.08 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such
Lender or its Affiliates may have.
Section 12.09 GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION. (a) THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTES AND ALL
CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) THAT MAY
BE BASED UPON, ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE IN ANY WAY TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

AMERICA FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, IN EITHER CASE LOCATED IN NEW
YORK COUNTY, NEW YORK, AND, BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH
PARTY HEREBY ACCEPTS FOR ITSELF AND (TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW) IN
RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, GENERALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY, THE JURISDICTION OF
THE AFORESAID COURTS. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OR BASED ON
THE GROUNDS OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS, WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO
THE BRINGING OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN SUCH RESPECTIVE
JURISDICTIONS. THIS SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION IS NON-EXCLUSIVE AND DOES NOT
PRECLUDE A PARTY FROM OBTAINING JURISDICTION OVER ANOTHER PARTY IN ANY COURT
OTHERWISE HAVING JURISDICTION.
135
(c) EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE SERVICE OF PROCESS OF ANY OF THE
AFOREMENTIONED COURTS IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING BY THE MAILING OF
COPIES THEREOF BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID, TO IT AT THE

PURSUANT TO SECTION 12.01 (OR ITS ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION), SUCH SERVICE TO
BECOME EFFECTIVE THIRTY (30) DAYS AFTER SUCH MAILING. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL
AFFECT THE RIGHT OF A PARTY OR ANY HOLDER OF A NOTE TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY
OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO COMMENCE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR
OTHERWISE PROCEED AGAINST ANOTHER PARTY IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.
(d) EACH PARTY HEREBY (i) IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR
PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT AND FOR
ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN; (ii) IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT

Section 12.10 Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein are
for convenience of reference only, are not part of this Agreement and shall not affect the
construction of, or be taken into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.
Section 12.11 Confidentiality. Each of the Global Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and the
Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that
Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates’ directors, officers, employees and agents,
including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to
whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and
instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory
authority, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar
legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (e) in
connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any
suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the
enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions
substantially the same as those of this Section 12.11, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any
prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement
(provided that such Person agrees in writing
136
to be bound by the provisions of this Section 12.11) or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty
(or its advisors) to any securitization or Swap Agreement relating to the Borrower and its
obligations or any credit insurance provider (provided that each such Person agrees in writing to
be bound by the provisions of this Section 12.11), (g) with the consent of the Borrower or (h) to the
extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this
Section 12.11 or (ii) becomes available to the Global Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any
Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower. For the purposes of this
Section 12.11, “Information” means all information received from the Borrower or any Restricted
Subsidiary relating to the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary and their businesses, other than
any such information that is available to the Global Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any
Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or a Restricted Subsidiary;
provided that, in the case of information received from the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary
after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential.
Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section 12.11
shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the
same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would
accord to its own confidential information.
Section 12.12 Interest Rate Limitation. It is the intention of the parties hereto that each Lender shall
conform strictly to usury laws applicable to it. Accordingly, if the transactions contemplated hereby
would be usurious as to any Lender under laws applicable to it (including the laws of the United
States of America and the State of Texas or any other jurisdiction whose laws may be mandatorily
applicable to such Lender notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement), then, in that
event, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any of the Loan Documents or any agreement
entered into in connection with or as security for the Notes, it is agreed as follows: (i) the aggregate
of all consideration which constitutes interest under law applicable to any Lender that is contracted
for, taken, reserved, charged or received by such Lender under any of the Loan Documents or
agreements or otherwise in connection with the Loans shall under no circumstances exceed the
maximum amount allowed by such applicable law, and any excess shall be canceled automatically
and if theretofore paid shall be credited by such Lender on the principal amount of the Secured
Indebtedness (or, to the extent that the principal amount of the Secured Indebtedness shall have
been or would thereby be paid in full, refunded by such Lender to the Borrower); and (ii) in the
event that the maturity of the Loans is accelerated by reason of an election of the holder thereof
resulting from any Event of Default under this Agreement or otherwise, or in the event of any
required or permitted prepayment, then such consideration that constitutes interest under law
applicable to any Lender may never include more than the maximum amount allowed by such
applicable law, and excess interest, if any, provided for in this Agreement or otherwise shall be
canceled automatically by such Lender as of the date of such acceleration or prepayment and, if
theretofore paid, shall be credited by such Lender on the principal amount of the Secured
Indebtedness (or, to the extent that the principal amount of the Secured Indebtedness shall have
been or would thereby be paid in full, refunded by such Lender to the Borrower). All sums paid or
agreed to be paid to any Lender for the use, forbearance or detention of sums due hereunder shall,
to the extent permitted by law applicable to such Lender, be amortized, prorated, allocated and
spread throughout the actual full term of the Loans until payment in full so that the rate or amount
of interest on account of any Loans hereunder does not exceed the maximum amount allowed by
such applicable law. If at any time and from time to time (A) the amount of interest payable to any
Lender on any date shall be
137
computed at the Highest Lawful Rate applicable to such Lender pursuant to this Section 12.12 and
(B) in respect of any subsequent interest computation period the amount of interest otherwise
payable to such Lender would be less than the amount of interest payable to such Lender
computed at the Highest Lawful Rate applicable to such Lender, then the amount of interest
payable to such Lender in respect of such subsequent interest computation period shall continue
to be computed at the Highest Lawful Rate applicable to such Lender until the total amount of
interest payable to such Lender shall equal the total amount of interest which would have been
payable to such Lender if the total amount of interest had been computed without giving effect to
this Section 12.12. To the extent that Chapter 303 of the Texas Finance Code is relevant for the
purpose of determining the Highest Lawful Rate applicable to a Lender, such Lender elects to
determine the applicable rate ceiling under such Chapter by the weekly ceiling from time to time in
effect. Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance Code does not apply to the Borrower’s obligations
hereunder.
Section 12.13 EXCULPATION PROVISIONS. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO SPECIFICALLY
AGREES THAT IT HAS A DUTY TO READ THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS AND AGREES THAT IT IS CHARGED WITH NOTICE AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE
TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS; THAT IT HAS IN FACT
READ THIS AGREEMENT AND IS FULLY INFORMED AND HAS FULL NOTICE AND KNOWLEDGE
OF THE TERMS, CONDITIONS AND EFFECTS OF THIS AGREEMENT; THAT IT HAS BEEN
REPRESENTED BY INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL OF ITS CHOICE THROUGHOUT THE
NEGOTIATIONS PRECEDING ITS EXECUTION OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS; AND HAS RECEIVED THE ADVICE OF ITS ATTORNEY IN ENTERING INTO THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS; AND THAT IT RECOGNIZES THAT CERTAIN
OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS RESULT IN ONE
PARTY ASSUMING THE LIABILITY INHERENT IN SOME ASPECTS OF THE TRANSACTION AND
RELIEVING THE OTHER PARTY OF ITS RESPONSIBILITY FOR SUCH LIABILITY. EACH PARTY
HERETO AGREES AND COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT CONTEST THE VALIDITY OR
ENFORCEABILITY OF ANY EXCULPATORY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER
LOAN DOCUMENTS ON THE BASIS THAT THE PARTY HAD NO NOTICE OR KNOWLEDGE OF
SUCH PROVISION OR THAT THE PROVISION IS NOT “CONSPICUOUS.”
Section 12.14 Collateral Matters; Swap Agreements. The benefit of the Security Instruments and of
the provisions of this Agreement relating to any collateral securing the Secured Indebtedness shall
also extend to and be available to the Secured Swap Providers (on a pro rata basis in respect of
any such obligations of the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to them) with respect to
any Swap Agreement, but excluding any additional transactions or confirmations entered into
(a) after such Secured Swap Provider ceases to be a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or (b) after
assignment by a Secured Swap Provider to a Person that is not a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender
at the time of such assignment. No Lender or any Affiliate of a Lender shall have any voting rights
under any Loan Document as a result of the existence of obligations owed to it under any such
Swap Agreements.
138
Section 12.15 No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and the
agreement of the Lenders to make Loans and the Issuing Banks to issue, amend, renew or extend
Letters of Credit hereunder are solely for the benefit of the Borrower, and no other Person
(including, without limitation, any Subsidiary of the Borrower, any obligor, contractor,
subcontractor, supplier or materialsman) shall have any rights, claims, remedies or privileges
hereunder or under any other Loan Document against the Global Administrative Agent, any other
Agent, any Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender, or any Lender for any reason whatsoever. There
are no third party beneficiaries other than the Canadian Lenders as expressly set forth herein.
Section 12.16 Flood Insurance Regulation. Notwithstanding any provision in any Security
Instrument to the contrary, in no event is any Building (as defined in the applicable Flood Insurance
Regulation) or Manufactured (Mobile) Home (as defined in the applicable Flood Insurance
Regulation) located in a special flood hazard area included in the definition of “Mortgaged
Property”, “Collateral” or similar definition in any Security Instrument and no such Building or
Manufactured (Mobile) Home shall be encumbered by any such Security Instrument.
Section 12.17 USA Patriot Act Notice. Each Lender hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to
the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001))
(the “Act”), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which
information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information that will allow
such Lender to identify the Borrower in accordance with the Act.
Section 12.18 No Fiduciary Duty. Each Agent, Lender and their respective Affiliates (collectively,
solely for purposes of this paragraph, the “Banks”), may have economic interests that conflict with
those of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries, their stockholders and/or their Affiliates (collectively,
solely for purposes of this paragraph, the “Obligors”). The Borrower agrees that nothing in the
Agreement or the Loan Documents or otherwise will be deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or
agency relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty between any Bank, on the one hand, and any
Obligor, on the other. The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that (a) the transactions
contemplated by the Loan Documents (including the exercise of rights and remedies hereunder
and thereunder) are arm’s-length commercial transactions between the Banks, on the one hand,
and the Obligors, on the other, and (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading
thereto, (x) no Bank has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of any Obligor
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (or the exercise of rights or remedies with
respect thereto) or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether any Bank has advised, is
currently advising or will advise any Obligor on other matters) or any other obligation to any
Obligor except the obligations expressly set forth in the Loan Documents and (y) each Bank is
acting solely as principal and not as the agent or fiduciary of any Obligor, its management,
stockholders, creditors or any other Person. The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that it has
consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate and that it is
responsible for making its own independent judgment with respect to such transactions and the
process leading thereto. The Borrower agrees that it will not claim that any Bank has rendered
advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to any Obligor, in
connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
139
Section 12.19 Amendment and Restatement Mechanics.
(a) On the Effective Date, subject to their reallocation among the Lenders in accordance with Annex
I, all loans, participations and other indebtedness, obligations and liabilities outstanding under the
Existing Credit Agreement on such date shall continue to constitute Loans, participations, and
other indebtedness, obligations and liabilities under this Agreement, and all Existing Letters of
Credit will automatically, without any further action on the part of any Person, be deemed to be
Letters of Credit hereunder.
(b) It is the intent of the parties hereto that this Agreement amends and restates in its entirety the
Existing Credit Agreement and re-evidences the obligations of the Borrower outstanding
thereunder. The commitments of the “Lenders” under the Existing Credit Agreement are
reallocated among the Lenders under this Agreement as set forth on Annex I and any “Lender”
under the Existing Credit Agreement who is not a Lender hereunder is released of its commitment
under the Existing Credit Agreement. Each party hereby waives any requirements for notice and
consent required to give effect to such reallocations. This Agreement does not constitute a
novation of the obligations and liabilities under the Existing Credit Agreement or evidence
repayment of any such obligations and liabilities.
Section 12.20 Ratification of Guaranty Agreement. Each U.S. Guarantor hereby consents and

FORM OF GUARANTY AGREEMENT
Exhibit E-2 - 1
GUARANTY AGREEMENT
THIS GUARANTY AGREEMENT (as it may be amended, restated, supplemented or modified from
time to time, this “Guaranty”) is dated as of September 6, 2011, by each of the undersigned
identified on the signature pages hereto as guarantors (together with any other entity that may
become a party hereto as provided herein, each a “Guarantor”, and collectively the “Guarantors”),
in favor of JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. (“Administrative Agent”), each of the other Secured
Parties and each of their successors and assigns as permitted pursuant to the Credit Agreement
(Administrative Agent, the Secured Parties, and their successors and assigns, collectively, the
“Beneficiaries”).
PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS
A. Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery hereof, Quicksilver Resources Inc., a
Delaware corporation (“Borrower”), Administrative Agent, the banks and other financial institutions
party thereto as “Lenders” (the “Lenders”) and the other agents party thereto are entering into a
Credit Agreement dated as of the date hereof (as amended, restated, replaced, modified or
supplemented from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”) pursuant to which the Lenders agreed to
make loans and other extensions of credit to Borrower for the purposes set forth therein (unless
otherwise defined herein, all terms used herein with their initial letter capitalized shall have the
meaning given such terms in the Credit Agreement).
B. The Lenders have required, as a condition to extending credit under the Credit Agreement, that
each Guarantor execute and deliver this Guaranty to guarantee the payment and performance of
the Secured Indebtedness.
C. Each Guarantor has determined that valuable benefits will be derived by it as a result of the
Credit Agreement and the extension of credit made (and to be made) by the Lenders thereunder.
D. Each Guarantor has further determined that the benefits accruing to it from the Credit
Agreement exceed such Guarantor’s anticipated liability under this Guaranty.
Accordingly, for valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged and confessed, each Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees as follows:
1. Each Guarantor hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees the prompt, complete and full
payment when due and payable, no matter how such shall become due and payable, of the
Secured Indebtedness, and further guarantees that Borrower will properly and timely perform the
Secured Indebtedness and other obligations and liabilities of Borrower and the Restricted
Subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement, Notes and other Loan Documents.
2. Each Guarantor covenants that, so long as any Lender has any Commitment or any Revolving
Credit Exposure under the Credit Agreement, it will, and, if necessary, will enable Borrower to, fully
comply with the conditions, covenants, and agreements set forth in the Credit Agreement.
Notwithstanding any contrary provision in this Guaranty, however, each Guarantor’s maximum
liability under this Guaranty is limited, to the extent, if any, required so that its liability is not subject
to avoidance under applicable Debtor Relief Laws (as such term is defined in Paragraph 9 hereof).
3. If any Guarantor is or becomes liable for any indebtedness owing by Borrower or any Restricted
Subsidiary to any Beneficiary by endorsement or otherwise than under this Guaranty, such liability
shall not be in any manner impaired or affected hereby, and the rights of the Beneficiaries
hereunder shall be cumulative of any and all other rights that the Beneficiaries may ever have
against such Guarantor. The exercise by any Beneficiary of any right or remedy hereunder or
under any other instrument, at law or in equity, shall not preclude the concurrent or subsequent
exercise of any other right or remedy.
4. All obligations of each Guarantor hereunder, shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of:
(a) any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver or release in respect of any of the
Secured Indebtedness, by operation of law or otherwise, or any obligation of any other guarantor
of any of the Secured Indebtedness, or any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the
payment or performance of the Secured Indebtedness;
(b) any lack of validity or enforceability relating to or against Borrower, any Restricted Subsidiary or
any other Person guaranteeing any of the Secured Indebtedness, for any reason related to the
Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument governing or
evidencing any Secured Indebtedness, or any Governmental Requirements purporting to prohibit
the payment by Borrower, any Restricted Subsidiary or any other Person guaranteeing the
Secured Indebtedness of the principal of or interest on the Secured Indebtedness;
(c) any modification or amendment of or supplement to the Credit Agreement or any other Loan
Document;
(d) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any part of
the Secured Indebtedness, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure
from the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument
governing or evidencing any Secured Indebtedness, including any increase or decrease in the rate
of interest thereon;
(e) any release, nonperfection or invalidity of any direct or indirect security for any obligation of
Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary under the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document or
any obligations of any other guarantor of any of the Secured Indebtedness, any amendment or
waiver of, or consent to departure from, any other guaranty or support document, any exchange,
release or non-perfection of any collateral, for all or any of the Loan Documents or Secured
Indebtedness, or any action or failure to act by Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Affiliate of
any Lender with respect to any collateral securing all or any part of the Secured Indebtedness;
(f) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of Borrower, any Restricted
Subsidiary or any other Person guaranteeing any of the Secured Indebtedness, or any insolvency,
bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting Borrower, any Restricted
Subsidiary or any other Person guaranteeing any of the Secured Indebtedness, or any of their
assets or any resulting release of discharge of any obligation of Borrower, any Restricted
Subsidiary or any other Person guaranteeing any of the Secured Indebtedness;
2
(g) any present or future law, regulation or order of any jurisdiction (whether of right or in fact) or of
any agency thereof purporting to reduce, amend, restructure or otherwise affect any term of any
Loan Document or Secured Indebtedness;
(h) any other setoff, defense or counterclaim whatsoever (in any case, whether based on contract,
tort or any other theory) with respect to the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document, any other
agreement or instrument or the transactions contemplated thereby which might constitute a legal
or equitable defense available to, or discharge of, Borrower or any Guarantor; or
(i) any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by Borrower, any Restricted Subsidiary or
any other Person guaranteeing any of the Secured Indebtedness, Administrative Agent, any
Lender or any other Person or any other circumstance whatsoever which might, but for the
provisions of this paragraph, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of any Guarantor’s
obligations hereunder.
5. In the event of default by Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary in payment of the Secured
Indebtedness, or any part thereof, when such Secured Indebtedness becomes due and payable,
either by its terms or as the result of the exercise of any power to accelerate, each Guarantor shall,
on demand, and without further notice of dishonor and without any notice having been given to
such Guarantor previous to such demand of the acceptance by Beneficiaries of this Guaranty, and
without any notice having been given to such Guarantor previous to such demand of the creating
or incurring of such Secured Indebtedness, pay the amount due thereon to Beneficiaries at
Administrative Agent’s office as set forth in the Credit Agreement, and it shall not be necessary for
any Beneficiary, in order to enforce such payment by any Guarantor, first, to institute suit or
exhaust its remedies against Borrower, any other Guarantor or others liable on such Secured
Indebtedness, to have Borrower joined with any Guarantor in any suit brought under this Guaranty
or to enforce its rights against any security which shall ever have been given to secure such
indebtedness; provided, however, that in the event any Beneficiary elects to enforce and/or
exercise any remedies it may possess with respect to any security for the Secured Indebtedness
prior to demanding payment from any Guarantor, such Guarantor shall nevertheless be obligated
hereunder for any and all sums still owing to Beneficiaries on the Secured Indebtedness and not
repaid or recovered incident to the exercise of such remedies.
6. Notice to any Guarantor of the acceptance of this Guaranty and of the making, renewing or
assignment of the Secured Indebtedness and each item thereof, are hereby expressly waived by
each Guarantor.
7. If all or any part of the Secured Indebtedness at any time is secured, each Guarantor agrees that
Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders may at any time and from time to time, at their discretion
and with or without valuable consideration, allow substitution or withdrawal of collateral or other
security and release collateral or other security or compromise or settle any amount due or owing
under the Credit Agreement or amend or modify in whole or in part the Credit Agreement or any
Loan Document executed in connection with same without
3
impairing or diminishing the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder. Each Guarantor further
agrees that if Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary executes in favor of any Beneficiary any
collateral agreement, mortgage or other security instrument, the exercise by any Beneficiary of any
right or remedy thereby conferred on such Beneficiary shall be wholly discretionary with such
Beneficiary, and that the exercise or failure to exercise any such right or remedy shall in no way
impair or diminish the obligation of each Guarantor hereunder. Each Guarantor further agrees that
the Beneficiaries and Administrative Agent shall not be liable for their failure to use diligence in the
collection of the Secured Indebtedness or in preserving the liability of any person liable for the
Secured Indebtedness, and each Guarantor hereby waives presentment for payment, notice of
nonpayment, protest and notice thereof (including, notice of acceleration), and diligence in
bringing suits against any Person liable on the Secured Indebtedness, or any part thereof.
8. Each Guarantor agrees that the Beneficiaries, in their discretion, may (i) bring suit against all
guarantors (including, without limitation, each Guarantor hereunder) of the Secured Indebtedness
jointly and severally or against any one or more of them, (ii) compound or settle with any one or
more of such guarantors for such consideration as the Beneficiaries may deem proper, and
(iii) release one or more of such guarantors from liability hereunder, and that no such action shall
impair the rights of the Beneficiaries to collect the Secured Indebtedness (or the unpaid balance
thereof) from other such guarantors of the Secured Indebtedness, or any of them, not so sued,
settled with or released. Each Guarantor agrees, however, that nothing contained in this paragraph,
and no action by the Beneficiaries permitted under this paragraph, shall in any way affect or impair
the rights or obligations of such guarantors among themselves.
9. In the case of each Guarantor, the representations and warranties set forth in Article VII of the
Credit Agreement as they relate to such Guarantor or to the Loan Documents to which such
Guarantor is a party will be true and correct in all material respects, provided that each reference in
each such representation and warranty to the Borrower’s knowledge shall, for the purposes of this
paragraph 9, be deemed to be a reference to such Guarantor’s knowledge. Each Guarantor further
represents and warrants to each Beneficiary that in executing and delivering this Guaranty, each
Guarantor has (a) without reliance on Administrative Agent or any information received from
Administrative Agent and based upon such documents and information it deems appropriate,
made an independent investigation of the transactions contemplated hereby and Borrower,
Borrower’s business, assets, operations, prospects and condition, financial or otherwise, and any
circumstances which may bear upon such transactions, Borrower or the obligations and risks
undertaken herein with respect to the Secured Indebtedness; (b) adequate means to obtain from
Borrower on a continuing basis information concerning Borrower; (c) full and complete access to
the Loan Documents and any other documents executed in connection with the Loan Documents;
and (d) not relied and will not rely upon any representations or warranties of Administrative Agent
not embodied herein or any acts heretofore or hereafter taken by Administrative Agent (including
but not limited to any review by Administrative Agent of the affairs of Borrower). As used in this
Guaranty, the term “Debtor Relief Laws” means the Bankruptcy Code of the United States of
America and all other applicable liquidation, conservatorship, bankruptcy, moratorium,
rearrangement, receivership, insolvency, reorganization, suspension of payments or similar debtor
relief laws from time to time in effect affecting the rights of creditors generally.
4
10. This Guaranty is for the benefit of the Secured Parties, their successors and permitted assigns,
and in the event of a permitted assignment by any Secured Party (or its successors or assigns) of
the Secured Indebtedness, or any part thereof, the rights and benefits hereunder, to the extent
applicable to the Secured Indebtedness so assigned, may be transferred with such Secured
Indebtedness. This Guaranty is binding upon each Guarantor and its successors and assigns.
11. No modification, consent, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Guaranty, nor consent
to any departure by any Guarantor therefrom, shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by Administrative Agent with requisite Lender approval as required under the Credit
Agreement, and then shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which
given. No notice to or demand on any Guarantor in any case shall, of itself, entitle such Guarantor
to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. No delay or omission by
the Beneficiaries in exercising any power or right hereunder shall impair any such right or power or
be construed as a waiver thereof or any acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such power preclude other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other
right or power hereunder. All rights and remedies of the Beneficiaries hereunder are cumulative of
each other and of every other right or remedy which the Beneficiaries may otherwise have at law or
in equity or under any other contract or document, and the exercise of one or more rights or
remedies shall not prejudice or impair the concurrent or subsequent exercise of other rights or
remedies.
12. No provision herein or in any promissory note, instrument or any other Loan Document
executed by Borrower or any Guarantor evidencing the Secured Indebtedness shall require the
payment or permit the collection of interest in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate. If any excess of
interest in such respect is provided for herein or in any such promissory note, instrument, or any
other Loan Document, the provisions of this paragraph shall govern, and neither Borrower nor any
Guarantor shall be obligated to pay the amount of such interest to the extent that it is in excess of
the amount permitted by law. The intention of the parties being to conform strictly to any applicable
federal or state usury laws now in force, all promissory notes, instruments and other Loan
Documents executed by Borrower or any Guarantor evidencing the Secured Indebtedness shall be
held subject to reduction to the amount allowed under said usury laws as now or hereafter
construed by the courts having jurisdiction.
13. If any Guarantor should breach or fail to perform any provision of this Guaranty, each Guarantor
agrees to pay the Beneficiaries all out-of-pocket expenses (including court costs and reasonable
attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Beneficiaries in the enforcement hereof.
14. (a) The liability of each Guarantor under this Guaranty shall in no manner be impaired, affected
or released by the insolvency, bankruptcy, making of an assignment for the benefit of creditors,
arrangement, compensation, composition or readjustment of Borrower or any Restricted
Subsidiary (other than such Guarantor), or any proceedings affecting the status, existence or
assets of Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than such Guarantor) or other similar
proceedings instituted by or against Borrower and any Restricted Subsidiary (other than such
Guarantor) and affecting the assets of Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than such
Guarantor).
5
(b) Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that any interest on any portion of the Secured
Indebtedness which accrues after the commencement of any proceeding referred to in clause (a)
above (or, if interest on any portion of the Secured Indebtedness ceases to accrue by operation of
law by reason of the commencement of said proceeding, such interest as would have accrued on
such portion of the Secured Indebtedness if said proceedings had not been commenced) shall be
included in the Secured Indebtedness because it is the intention of each Guarantor and the
Beneficiaries that the Secured Indebtedness which is guaranteed by each Guarantor pursuant to
this Guaranty should be determined without regard to any rule of law or order which may relieve
Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary of any portion of such Secured Indebtedness. To the extent,
not prohibited by applicable law, each Guarantor will permit any trustee in bankruptcy, receiver,
debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors or similar person to pay the
Beneficiaries or Administrative Agent, or allow the claim of the Beneficiaries or Administrative
Agent in respect of, any such interest accruing after the date on which such proceeding is
commenced.
(c) In the event that all or any portion of the Secured Indebtedness is paid by Borrower or any
Restricted Subsidiary, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall continue and remain in
full force and effect or be reinstated, as the case may be, in the event that all or any part of such
payment(s) are rescinded or recovered directly or indirectly from Administrative Agent or any
Beneficiary as a preference, fraudulent transfer or otherwise, and any such payments which are so
rescinded or recovered shall constitute Secured Indebtedness for all purposes under this
Guaranty.
15. Each Guarantor understands and agrees that any amounts of any Guarantor on account with
any Lender may, if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, be offset to satisfy
the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder to the extent provided in the Credit Agreement.
16. Each Guarantor hereby subordinates and makes inferior any and all indebtedness now or at
any time hereafter owed by Borrower or any other Guarantor to such Guarantor to the Secured
Indebtedness of Borrower or such other Guarantor evidenced by the Credit Agreement or this
Guaranty and agrees if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, not to permit
Borrower or any other Guarantor to repay, or to accept payment from Borrower or any other
Guarantor of, such subordinated indebtedness or any part thereof if so directed in writing by the
Administrative Agent. Each Guarantor further agrees that if the Majority Lenders so request, such
subordinated indebtedness of Borrower or such other Guarantor to such Guarantor shall be
collected, enforced and received by such Guarantor as trustee for Administrative Agent (for the
benefit of the Secured Parties) and shall be paid over to Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the
Secured Parties) on account of the Secured Indebtedness but without reducing or affecting in any
manner the liability of such Guarantor under the other provisions of this Guaranty.
17. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that to the extent that any Guarantor shall have paid more than
its proportionate share of any payment made hereunder, such Guarantor shall be entitled to seek
and receive contribution from and against any other Guarantor hereunder which has not paid its
proportionate share of such payment. Each Guarantor’s right of contribution shall be subject to the
terms and conditions of Paragraph 18. The provisions of this Paragraph 17
6
shall in no respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor to the Secured Parties, and
each Guarantor shall remain liable to the Secured Parties for the full amount guaranteed by such
Guarantor hereunder.
18. Notwithstanding any payment made by any Guarantor hereunder or any set-off or application of
funds of any Guarantor by any Secured Party, no Guarantor shall be entitled to exercise any rights
of subrogation against Borrower or any other Guarantor or any collateral security or guaranty or
right of offset held by any Secured Party for the payment of the Secured Indebtedness, nor shall
any Guarantor seek or be entitled to seek any indemnity, exoneration, participation, contribution or
reimbursement from Borrower or any other Guarantor in respect of payments made by such
Guarantor hereunder, until all amounts owing to the Secured Parties by Borrower or any Restricted
Subsidiary on account of the Secured Indebtedness are paid in full and the Commitments are
terminated. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at
any time when all of the Secured Indebtedness shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall
be held by such Guarantor in trust for Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the Secured Parties),
segregated from other funds of such Guarantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such
Guarantor, be turned over to Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the Secured Parties) in the
exact form received by such Guarantor (duly endorsed by such Guarantor to Administrative Agent,
if required), to be applied against any Secured Indebtedness then due and payable.
19. If any provision of this Guaranty is held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, such provision
shall be fully severable, this Guaranty shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid, or
unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, and the remaining provisions hereof
shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable
provision or by its severance herefrom. Furthermore, in lieu of such illegal, invalid, or
unenforceable provision there shall be added automatically as a part of this Guaranty a provision
as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision as may be possible and be
legal, valid and enforceable.
(a) Section 12.09 of the Credit Agreement and all relevant defined terms shall apply, mutatis
mutandis, to any of the Guarantors hereunder and such Section is hereby incorporated herein by
reference and made a part of this Guaranty as if set forth herein in full; provided that each
Guarantor’s address for notices and service of process shall be to each Guarantor’s office, c/o
Quicksilver Resources Inc., 801 Cherry St, Suite 3700, Unit 19, Fort Worth, Texas 76102, Attn: Vice
President – Treasurer (Telecopy No. 817-665-5016) with a copy to General Counsel (Telecopy
No. 817-668-5012).
20. THIS GUARANTY AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS COLLECTIVELY REPRESENT THE
FINAL AGREEMENT BY AND AMONG THE SECURED PARTIES, ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND
EACH GUARANTOR AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR,
CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE SECURED PARTIES,
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND EACH GUARANTOR. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL
AGREEMENTS AMONG THE SECURED PARTIES, ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND EACH
GUARANTOR.
7
21. Each Person that is required to become a party to this Guaranty pursuant to Section 8.13(c) of
the Credit Agreement shall become a Guarantor for all purposes of this Guaranty upon execution
and delivery by such Person of an Assumption Agreement in the form of Annex I attached hereto.
22. (a) At any time any Guarantor is sold or otherwise disposed of in a transaction permitted under
the Credit Agreement, then in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement (including,
without limitation, Section 8.13 and 9.10(d)), such Guarantor shall be released automatically from its
obligations under this Guaranty.
(b) At any time any Guarantor is not otherwise required to guarantee the Secured Indebtedness
pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement (including, without limitation Section 8.13) or under
any other Loan Document, such Guarantor shall be released automatically from its obligations
under this Guaranty, and the Administrative Agent, at the written request and expense of Borrower,
will promptly execute any documentation reasonably necessary to evidence the release of such
Guarantor.

Section 3.01. [Reserved].
Section 3.02. Title; No Other Liens. Except for Permitted Liens and the security interest granted to
the Pledgee for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties pursuant to this Agreement, such Pledgor
is the record and beneficial owner of its respective items of the Collateral free and clear of any and

Liens on the Collateral in existence on the date hereof (subject to Permitted Liens).
5

any trade name. Each Pledgor is not now, and within five (5) years prior to the date hereof, has not
been known by any legal name different from the one set forth on the signature page hereto, nor,
within five (5) years prior to the date hereof, has any Pledgor been the subject of any merger or
other corporate reorganization.
Section 3.05. Pledged Securities.
(a) The Pledged Securities required to be pledged under the Credit Agreements by such Pledgor
are listed in Schedule 2. The shares of Pledged Securities pledged by such Pledgor hereunder
constitute all the issued and outstanding shares of all classes of the Equity Interests of each Issuer
owned by such Pledgor as set forth on Schedule 2; provided that Pledged Securities shall not

agreement relating thereto which would limit or restrict (i) the grant of a security interest in the
Pledged Equity Interests, (ii) the perfection of such security interest or (iii) the exercise of remedies

the case may be, of such Issuer, as the case may be, shall become a member, partner, shareholder
or other owner, as the case may be, of such Issuer, as the case may be, entitled to participate in the
management thereof and, upon the transfer of the entire interest of such Pledgor, such Pledgor
ceases to be a member, partner, shareholder or other owner, as the case may be.

Cash:
Section 4.01. [Reserved].
Section 4.02. Maintenance of Perfected Security Interest; Further Documentation. In the case of
each Pledgor, such Pledgor agrees that:
(a) it shall, to the extent it has the legal power to do so, maintain the security interest created by this
Agreement as a perfected security interest having the priority described in Section 3.03 and shall
defend such security interest against the claims and demands of all Persons whomsoever (subject
to Permitted Liens); it being understood that no Pledgor shall have any obligation or liability under
this Section 4.02(a) with respect to acts or omissions of any Combined Secured Party.
(b) it will furnish to the Pledgee and the Lenders from time to time statements and schedules further
identifying and describing the Collateral and such other reports in connection with the Collateral as
the Pledgee may reasonably request, all in reasonable detail.
(c) at any time and from time to time, upon the written request of the Pledgee, and at the sole
expense of such Pledgor, it will promptly and duly execute and deliver, and have recorded, such
further instruments and documents and take such further actions as the Pledgee may reasonably
deem necessary for the purpose of obtaining or preserving the full benefits of this Agreement and
of the rights and powers herein granted, including, without limitation, the delivery of certificated
securities and the filing of any financing or continuation statements under the UCC (or other similar
laws) in effect in such Pledgor’s jurisdiction with respect to the security interests created hereby.
Section 4.03. Changes in Locations, Name, Etc. Such Pledgor recognizes that financing statements
pertaining to the Collateral have been or may be filed where such Pledgor maintains any Collateral

permit any change in such Pledgor’s (a) corporate name, (b) identity or corporate structure or in the
jurisdiction in which it is incorporated or formed, or (c) jurisdiction of organization or its
organizational identification number in such jurisdiction of organization, unless, in each case, such
Pledgor shall have (i) promptly notified (and in any event within thirty (30) days following any such
change) the Pledgee in writing of such change, and (ii) taken all action reasonably requested by the
Pledgee for the purpose of maintaining the perfection and priority of the Pledgee’s security
interests under this Agreement. In any notice furnished pursuant to this Section 4.03, such Pledgor
will expressly state in a conspicuous manner that the notice is required by this Agreement and
contains facts that may require additional filings of financing statements or other notices for the
purposes of continuing perfection of the Pledgee’s security interest in the Collateral. At the
reasonable request of the Pledgee, upon the occurrence of such event, the Borrower will provide to
the Pledgee and the Combined Lenders an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Pledgee, to the effect that such event will not impair the validity of the security
interests hereunder, the perfection and priority thereof, the enforceability of the Combined Loan
Documents, and such other matters as may be reasonably requested by the Pledgee.
7

(a) if such Pledgor shall become entitled to receive or shall receive any stock certificate (including,
without limitation, any certificate representing a stock dividend or a distribution in connection with
any reclassification, increase or reduction of capital or any certificate issued in connection with any
reorganization), option or rights in respect of the Equity Interests of any Issuer, whether in addition
to, in substitution of, as a conversion of, or in exchange for, any shares of the Pledged Securities,
or otherwise in respect thereof, such Pledgor shall accept the same as the agent of the Combined
Secured Parties, hold the same in trust for the Combined Secured Parties, segregated from other
Property of such Pledgor, and deliver the same forthwith to the Pledgee in the exact form received,
duly indorsed by such Pledgor to the Pledgee, if required, together with an undated stock power
covering such certificate duly executed in blank by such Pledgor and with, if the Pledgee so
requests, signature guaranteed, to be held by the Pledgee, subject to the terms hereof, as
additional collateral security for the Secured Obligations; provided that such Pledgor’s obligations
under this Section 4.04(a) shall be limited to 65% of the total combined voting power of all classes
of Equity Interests of an Issuer that is a Foreign Subsidiary.
(b) without the prior written consent of the Pledgee or as permitted by the Credit Agreements, such
Pledgor will not enter into any agreement or undertaking restricting the right or ability of such
Pledgor or the Pledgee to sell, assign or transfer any of the Pledged Securities or Proceeds thereof.
(c) in the case of each Pledgor that is an Issuer, such Issuer agrees that (i) it will be bound by the
terms of this Agreement relating to the Pledged Securities issued by it and will comply with such
terms insofar as such terms are applicable to it, (ii) it will notify the Pledgee promptly in writing of
the occurrence of any of the events described in Section 4.04(a) with respect to the Pledged
Securities issued by it and (iii) the terms of Section 5.02(a) and Section 5.04 shall apply to it, mutatis
mutandis, with respect to all actions that may be required of it pursuant to Section 5.02(d) or
Section 5.04 with respect to the Pledged Securities issued by it. In the case of any Issuer that is not
a Pledgor hereunder, such Pledgor shall promptly cause such Issuer to execute and deliver to the
Pledgee an Acknowledgment and Consent in substantially the form of Exhibit A.
(d) in the case of each Pledgor that is a partner in a partnership, such Pledgor hereby consents to
the extent required by the applicable partnership agreement to the pledge by each other Pledgor,
pursuant to the terms hereof, of the Pledged Equity Interests in such partnership and to the
transfer following the occurrence of an Event of Default of such Pledged Equity Interests to the
Pledgee or its nominee and to the substitution of the Pledgee or its nominee as a substituted
partner in such partnership with all the rights, powers and duties of a general partner or a limited
partner, as the case may be. In the case of each Pledgor that is a member of a limited liability
company, such Pledgor hereby consents to the extent required by the applicable limited liability
company agreement (or similar Organizational Document) to the pledge by each other Pledgor,
pursuant to the terms hereof, of the Pledged Equity Interests in such limited liability company and
to the transfer following the occurrences of an Event of Default of such Pledged Equity Interests to
the Pledgee or its nominee and to the substitution of the Pledgee or its nominee as a substituted
member of such limited liability company with all the rights, powers and duties of a member of such
limited liability company.
8
(e) such Pledgor shall not agree to any amendment of an Organizational Document that in any way
adversely affects the perfection of the security interest of the Pledgee in the Pledged Equity
Interests pledged by such Pledgor hereunder, including any amendment electing to treat the
membership, partnership, shareholder or other interest of such Pledgor as a security under
Section 8-103 of the UCC.
(f) such Pledgor shall furnish to the Pledgee such stock powers and other instruments as may be
required by the Pledgee to assure the transferability of the Pledged Securities when and as often
as may be reasonably requested by the Pledgee.

the Issuer thereof (if a Domestic Subsidiary) owned by any Pledgor and (y) not less than 65% of the
total combined voting power of all classes of Equity Interests and 100% of all non-voting Equity
Interests of the Issuer thereof (if a Foreign Subsidiary).
ARTICLE 5
REMEDIAL PROVISIONS
Section 5.01. Code and Other Remedies.
(a) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Pledgee, on behalf
of the Combined Secured Parties, may exercise, in addition to all other rights and remedies granted
to them in this Agreement, the other Combined Loan Documents and in any other instrument or
agreement securing, evidencing or relating to the Secured Obligations, all rights and remedies of a
secured party under the UCC or any other applicable law or otherwise available at law or equity.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Pledgee, without demand of performance or
other demand, presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except any notice
required by law referred to below) to or upon any Pledgor or any other Person (all and each of
which demands, defenses, advertisements and notices are hereby waived), may in such
circumstances forthwith collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon the Collateral, or any part
thereof, and/or may forthwith sell, lease, assign, give option or options to purchase, or otherwise
dispose of and deliver the Collateral or any part thereof (or contract to do any of the foregoing), in
one or more parcels at public or private sale or sales, at any exchange, broker’s board or any office
of any Combined Secured Party or elsewhere upon such terms and conditions as it may deem
advisable and at such prices as it may deem best, for cash or on credit or for future delivery without
assumption of any credit risk. Any Combined Secured Party shall have the right upon any such
public sale or sales, and, to the extent permitted by law, upon any such private sale or sales, to
purchase the whole or any part of the Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of redemption in
any Pledgor, which right or equity is hereby waived and released. If applicable to any particular item
of Collateral, each Pledgor further agrees, at the Pledgee’s request, to assemble the Collateral and
make it available to the Pledgee at places which the Pledgee shall reasonably select, whether at
such Pledgor’s premises or elsewhere. Any such sale or transfer by the Pledgee either to itself or
to any other Person shall be absolutely free from any claim of right by Pledgor, including any
equity or right of redemption, stay or appraisal which Pledgor has or may have under any rule of
law, regulation or statute now existing or hereafter adopted (and such Pledgor hereby waives any
rights it may have in respect thereof). Upon any such sale or transfer, the Pledgee shall have the
right to deliver, assign and
9
transfer to the purchaser or transferee thereof the Collateral so sold or transferred. The Pledgee
shall apply the net proceeds of any action taken by it pursuant to this Section 5.01, after deducting
all reasonable costs and expenses of every kind incurred in connection therewith or incidental to
the care or safekeeping of any of the Collateral or in any way relating to the Collateral or the rights
of the Pledgee and the Combined Secured Parties hereunder, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements, to the payment in whole or in part of the Secured
Obligations, in accordance with Section 10.02(c) of the U.S. Credit Agreement and Section 10.2(c)
of the Canadian Credit Agreement, subject to Section 12.21 of the U.S. Credit Agreement and
Section 12.20 of the Canadian Credit Agreement, and only after such application and after the
payment by the Pledgee of any other amount required by any provision of law, including, without
limitation, Section 9-615 of the UCC, need the Pledgee account for the surplus, if any, to any
Pledgor. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Pledgor waives all claims, damages and
demands it may acquire against the Pledgee or any Combined Secured Party arising out of the
exercise by them of any rights hereunder, except in the case of gross negligence or willful
misconduct by the Pledgee or any such Combined Secured Party, respectively. If any notice of a
proposed sale or other disposition of Collateral shall be required by law, such notice shall be
deemed reasonable and proper if given at least ten (10) days before such sale or other disposition.
(b) In the event that the Pledgee elects not to sell the Collateral, the Pledgee retains its rights to
dispose of or utilize the Collateral or any part or parts thereof in any manner authorized or
permitted by law or in equity, and to apply the proceeds of the same towards payment of the
Secured Obligations. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each and every method of
disposition of the Collateral described in this Agreement shall constitute disposition in a
commercially reasonable manner.
(c) The Pledgee may appoint any Person as agent to perform any act or acts necessary or incident
to any sale or transfer of the Collateral.
Section 5.02. Pledged Securities.
(a) Unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and the Pledgee shall have
given notice to the relevant Pledgor of the Pledgee’s intent to exercise its corresponding rights
pursuant to Section 5.02(b), each Pledgor shall be permitted to receive all cash dividends paid in
respect of the Pledged Securities paid in the normal course of business of the relevant Issuer, to
the extent permitted in the Credit Agreements, and to exercise all voting, consent and corporate,
partnership or limited liability company rights with respect to the Pledged Securities; provided,
however, that no vote shall be cast, consent given or right exercised or other action taken by such
Pledgor that would impair the Collateral, or be inconsistent with or result in any violation of any
provision of the Credit Agreements, this Agreement or any other Combined Loan Document. Upon
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, any sums paid upon or in
respect of any Pledged Securities upon the liquidation or dissolution of any Issuer of any Pledged
Securities, any distribution of capital made on or in respect of any Pledged Securities or any
property distributed upon or with respect to any Pledged Securities pursuant to the recapitalization
or reclassification of the capital of any Issuer of Pledged Securities or pursuant to the
reorganization thereof shall, unless otherwise subject to a perfected security interest in favor of the
Pledgee and subject to Section 5.02(b), be delivered to the Pledgee to be
10
held by it hereunder as additional collateral security for the Secured Obligations. If any sum of
money or property so paid or distributed in respect of any Pledged Securities shall be received by
such Pledgor, such Pledgor shall, until such money or property is paid or delivered to the Pledgee,
hold such money or property in trust for the Pledgee, segregated from other funds of such
Pledgor, as additional security for the Secured Obligations.
(b) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, upon notice by the
Pledgee of its intent to exercise such rights to the relevant Pledgor or Pledgors, (i) the Pledgee
shall have the right to receive any and all cash dividends, payments, Property or other Proceeds
paid in respect of the Pledged Securities and make application thereof to the Secured Obligations
in accordance with Section 10.02(c) of the U.S. Credit Agreement and Section 10.02(c) of the
Canadian Credit Agreement, subject to the Section 12.21 of the U.S. Credit Agreement and
Section 12.20 of the Canadian Credit Agreement, and (ii) any or all of the Pledged Securities shall
be registered in the name of the Pledgee or its nominee, and (iii) the Pledgee or its nominee may
exercise (A) all voting, consent, corporate, partnership or limited liability company and other rights
pertaining to such Pledged Securities at any meeting of shareholders, partners or members (or
other equivalent body) of the relevant Issuer or Issuers or otherwise and (B) any and all rights of
conversion, exchange and subscription and any other rights, privileges or options pertaining to
such Pledged Securities as if it were the absolute owner thereof (including, without limitation, the
right to exchange at its discretion any and all of the Pledged Securities upon the merger,
consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or other fundamental change in the organizational
structure of any Issuer, or upon the exercise by any Pledgor or the Pledgee of any right, privilege
or option pertaining to such Pledged Securities, and in connection therewith, the right to deposit
and deliver any and all of the Pledged Securities with any committee, depositary, transfer agent,
registrar or other designated agency upon such terms and conditions as the Pledgee may
determine), all without liability except to account for Property actually received by it, but the
Pledgee shall have no duty to any Pledgor to exercise any such right, privilege or option and shall
not be responsible for any failure to do so or delay in so doing.
(c) In order to permit the Pledgee to exercise the voting and other consensual rights that it may be
entitled to exercise pursuant hereto and to receive all dividends and other distributions that it may
be entitled to receive hereunder, (i) each Pledgor shall promptly execute and deliver (or cause to be
executed and delivered) to the Pledgee all such proxies, dividend payment orders and other
instruments as the Pledgee may from time to time reasonably request and (ii) without limiting the
effect of clause (i) above, such Pledgor hereby grants to the Pledgee an irrevocable proxy to vote
all or any part of the Pledged Securities and to exercise all other rights, powers, privileges and
remedies to which a holder of the Pledged Securities would be entitled (including giving or
withholding written consents of shareholders, partners or members, as the case may be, calling
special meetings of shareholders, partners or members, as the case may be, and voting at such
meetings), which proxy shall be effective, automatically and without the necessity of any action
(including any transfer of any Pledged Securities on the record books of the Issuer thereof) by any
other Person (including the Issuer of such Pledged Securities or any officer or agent thereof) upon
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and which proxy shall only
terminate when the Secured Obligations are Paid In Full In Cash.
11
(d) Each Pledgor hereby authorizes and instructs each Issuer of any Pledged Securities pledged
by such Pledgor hereunder to (i) comply with any instruction received by it from the Pledgee in
writing that (A) states that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (B) is otherwise
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, without any other or further instructions from such
Pledgor, and each Pledgor agrees that each Issuer shall be fully protected in so complying, and
(ii) unless otherwise expressly permitted hereby, pay any dividends or other payments with respect
to the Pledged Securities directly to the Pledgee if so required pursuant to Section 5.02(b).
(e) Without limiting any of the rights of the Pledgee under Section 5.02(b), upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, if the Issuer of any Pledged Securities is the subject
of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, custodianship or other proceedings under the
supervision of any Governmental Authority, then all rights of the Pledgor in respect thereof to
exercise the voting and other consensual rights which such Pledgor would otherwise be entitled to
exercise with respect to the Pledged Securities issued by such Issuer shall cease, and all such
rights shall thereupon become vested in the Pledgee who shall thereupon have the sole right to
exercise such voting and other consensual rights, but the Pledgee shall have no duty to exercise
any such voting or other consensual rights and shall not be responsible for any failure to do so or
delay in so doing.
Section 5.03. [Reserved].
Section 5.04. Private Sales of Pledged Securities.
(a) Each Pledgor recognizes that the Pledgee may be unable to effect a public sale of any or all the
Pledged Securities, by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act and applicable
state securities laws or otherwise or may determine that a public sale is impracticable or not
commercially reasonable and, accordingly, may resort to one or more private sales thereof to a
restricted group of purchasers which will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire such
securities for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale
thereof. Each Pledgor acknowledges and agrees that any such private sale may result in prices
and other terms less favorable than if such sale were a public sale and, notwithstanding such
circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a
commercially reasonable manner. The Pledgee shall be under no obligation to delay a sale of any
of the Pledged Securities for the period of time necessary to permit the Issuer thereof to register
such securities for public sale under the Securities Act, or under applicable state securities laws,
even if such Issuer would agree to do so.
(b) Each Pledgor agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to do or cause to be done all such
other acts as may reasonably be necessary to make such sale or sales of all or any portion of the
Pledged Securities pursuant to this Section 5.04 valid and binding and in compliance with any and
all other applicable Governmental Requirements. Each Pledgor further agrees that a breach of any
of the covenants contained in this Section 5.04 will cause irreparable injury to the Combined
Secured Parties, that the Combined Secured Parties have no adequate remedy at law in respect of
such breach and, as a consequence, that each and every covenant contained in this Section 5.04
shall be specifically enforceable against such Pledgor, and such Pledgor hereby waives and
agrees not to assert any defenses against an action for specific performance of such covenants
except for a defense that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Credit
Agreement.
12
Section 5.05. Deficiency. Each Pledgor shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any
sale or other disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay the Secured Obligations and the
fees and disbursements of any attorneys employed by the Pledgee or any Combined Secured
Party to collect such deficiency.
Section 5.06. Non-Judicial Enforcement. The Pledgee may enforce its rights hereunder without
prior judicial process or judicial hearing, and to the extent permitted by law, each Pledgor expressly
waives any and all legal rights which might otherwise require the Pledgee to enforce its rights by
judicial process.
ARTICLE 6
THE PLEDGEE
Section 6.01. Pledgee’s Appointment as Attorney-in-Fact, Etc.
(a) Each Pledgor hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Pledgee and any officer or agent
thereof, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable
power and authority in the place and stead of such Pledgor and in the name of such Pledgor or in
its own name, for the purpose of carrying out the terms of this Agreement, to take any and all
reasonably appropriate action and to execute any and all documents and instruments which may
be reasonably necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, and, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Pledgor hereby gives the Pledgee the power and right,
on behalf of such Pledgor, without notice to or assent by such Pledgor, to do any or all of the
following:
(i) unless being disputed under Section 8.04 of the U.S. Credit Agreement or Section 8.04 of the
Canadian Credit Agreement, pay or discharge Taxes and Liens levied or placed on or threatened
against the Collateral, effect any repairs or any insurance required by the terms of this Agreement
or any other Combined Loan Document and pay all or any part of the premiums therefor and the
costs thereof;
(ii) execute, in connection with any sale provided for in Section 5.01 or Section 5.04, any
endorsements, assignments or other instruments of conveyance or transfer with respect to the
Collateral; and
(iii) (A) direct any party liable for any payment under any of the Collateral to make payment of any
and all moneys due or to become due thereunder directly to the Pledgee or as the Pledgee shall
direct; (B) ask or demand for, collect, and receive payment of and receipt for, any and all moneys,
claims and other amounts due or to become due at any time in respect of or arising out of any
Collateral; (C) in the name of such Pledgor or its own name, or otherwise, take possession of and
indorse and collect any check, draft, note, acceptance or other instrument for the payment of
moneys due with respect to any Collateral and commence and prosecute any suits, actions or
proceedings at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect the
13
Collateral or any portion thereof and to enforce any other right in respect of any Collateral;
(D) defend any suit, action or proceeding brought against such Pledgor with respect to any
Collateral; (E) settle, compromise or adjust any such suit, action or proceeding and, in connection
therewith, give such discharges or releases as the Pledgee may deem appropriate; and
(F) generally, sell, transfer, pledge and make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with
any of the Collateral as fully and completely as though the Pledgee were the absolute owner
thereof for all purposes, and do, at the Pledgee’s option and such Pledgor’s expense, at any time,
or from time to time, all acts and things which the Pledgee deems necessary to protect, preserve or
realize upon the Collateral and the Pledgee’s and the Combined Secured Parties’ security interests
therein and to effect the intent of this Agreement, all as fully and effectively as such Pledgor might
do.
Anything in this Section 6.01(a) to the contrary notwithstanding, the Pledgee agrees that it will not
exercise any rights under the power of attorney provided for in this Section 6.01(a) unless an Event
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.
(b) If any Pledgor fails to perform or comply with any of its agreements contained herein within the
applicable grace periods, the Pledgee, at its option, but without any obligation so to do, may
perform or comply, or otherwise cause performance or compliance, with such agreement.
(c) The expenses of the Pledgee incurred in connection with actions undertaken as provided in this
Section 6.01, together with interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the post-default rate
specified in Section 3.02(c) of the Credit Agreement, but in no event to exceed the Highest Lawful
Rate, from the date of payment by the Pledgee to the date reimbursed by the relevant Pledgor, shall
be payable by such Pledgor to the Pledgee on demand.
(d) Each Pledgor hereby ratifies all that said attorneys shall lawfully do or cause to be done by
virtue and in compliance hereof. All powers, authorizations and agencies contained in this
Agreement are coupled with an interest and are irrevocable until this Agreement is terminated and
the security interests created hereby are released.
Section 6.02. Duty of Pledgee. The Pledgee’s sole duty with respect to the custody, safekeeping
and physical preservation of the Collateral in its possession, under Section 9-207 of the UCC or
otherwise, shall be to deal with it in the same manner as the Pledgee deals with similar Property for
its own account and shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and
preservation of the Collateral in its possession if the Collateral is accorded treatment substantially
equal to that which comparable secured parties accord comparable collateral. Neither the Pledgee,
any Combined Secured Party nor any of their Related Parties shall be liable for failure to demand,
collect or realize upon any of the Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be under any
obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the request of any Pledgor or any
other Person or to take any other action whatsoever with regard to the Collateral or any part
thereof. The powers conferred on the Pledgee and the Combined Secured Parties hereunder are
solely to protect the Pledgee’s and the Combined Secured Parties’ interests in the Collateral and
shall not impose any duty upon the Pledgee or any Combined Secured Party to exercise any such
powers. The Pledgee and the Combined Secured Parties shall be
14
accountable only for amounts that they actually receive as a result of the exercise of such powers,
and neither they nor any of their Related Parties shall be responsible to any Pledgor for any act or
failure to act hereunder, except for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct. To the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, the Pledgee shall be under no duty whatsoever to make or give
any presentment, notice of dishonor, protest, demand for performance, notice of non-performance,
notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration, or other notice or demand in connection with
any Collateral or the Secured Obligations, or to take any steps necessary to preserve any rights
against any Pledgor or other Person or ascertaining or taking action with respect to calls,
conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders or other matters relative to any Collateral, whether or
not it has or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters. Each Pledgor, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, waives any right of marshaling in respect of any and all Collateral, and waives
any right to require the Pledgee or any Combined Secured Party to proceed against any Pledgor or
other Person, exhaust any Collateral or enforce any other remedy which the Pledgee or any
Combined Secured Party now has or may hereafter have against each Pledgor, any Pledgor or
other Person.
Section 6.03. Filing of Financing Statements. Pursuant to the UCC and any other applicable law,
each Pledgor authorizes the Pledgee to file or record financing statements and other filing or
recording documents or instruments with respect to the Collateral in such form and in such offices
as the Pledgee reasonably determines appropriate to perfect the security interests of the Pledgee
under this Agreement. A photographic or other reproduction of this Agreement shall be sufficient
as a financing statement or other filing or recording document or instrument for filing or recording
in any jurisdiction.
Section 6.04. Authority of Pledgee. Each Pledgor acknowledges that the rights and responsibilities
of the Pledgee under this Agreement with respect to any action taken by the Pledgee or the
exercise or non-exercise by the Pledgee of any option, voting right, request, judgment or other
right or remedy provided for herein or resulting or arising out of this Agreement shall, as between
the Pledgee and the Combined Secured Parties, be governed by the Credit Agreements and by
such other agreements with respect thereto as may exist from time to time among them, but, as
between the Pledgee and the Pledgors, the Pledgee shall be conclusively presumed to be acting as
agent for the Combined Secured Parties with full and valid authority so to act or refrain from acting,
and no Pledgor shall be under any obligation, or entitlement, to make any inquiry respecting such
authority.
ARTICLE 7

Section 7.01. Waiver. No failure on the part of the Pledgee or any Combined Secured Party to
exercise and no delay in exercising, and no course of dealing with respect to, any right, power,
privilege or remedy or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right, power,
privilege or remedy under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement or any other Combined Loan Document preclude or be construed as a waiver of any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power, privilege or remedy. The

equity.

this Section 7.03(b) to the extent that such Person fails to notify such Pledgor of its intent to make a
claim for indemnification under this Section 7.03(b) within 180 days after a claim is asserted against
such Person by the relevant Governmental Authority.
(c) Each Pledgor agrees to pay, and to save the Pledgee and the Combined Secured Parties
harmless from, any and all liabilities, claims, losses, damages, penalties, expenses, charges or
disbursements with respect to the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance and
administration of this Agreement to the extent the Borrower would be required to do so pursuant to
Section 12.03 of the U.S. Credit Agreement or Section 12.03 of the Canadian Credit Agreement.

the Canadian Credit Agreement, no Pledgor may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Pledgee and the Majority
Lenders, and any such purported assignment, transfer or delegation shall be null and void.
16
Section 7.06. Survival; Revival; Reinstatement.
(a) All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by any Pledgor herein and in
the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or
any other Combined Loan Document to which it is a party shall be considered to have been relied
upon by the Pledgee, the other Agents, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders and shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Combined Loans and issuance of
any Combined Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or
on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Pledgee, the other Agents, any Issuing Bank or any
Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at
the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect until the
Secured Obligations are Paid In Full In Cash. The provisions of Section 7.03 shall survive and
remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, the repayment of the Combined Loans, the expiration or termination of the Combined
Letters of Credit and the Combined Commitments or the termination of this Agreement, any other
Combined Loan Document or any provision hereof or thereof.
(b) To the extent that any payments on the Secured Obligations or proceeds of any Collateral are
subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be
repaid to a trustee, debtor in possession, receiver or other Person under any bankruptcy law,
common law or equitable cause, then to such extent, the Secured Obligations so satisfied shall be
revived and continue as if such payment or proceeds had not been received and the Pledgee’s and
the Combined Secured Parties’ Liens, security interests, rights, powers and remedies under this
Agreement and each other Combined Loan Document shall continue in full force and effect. In
such event, each Combined Loan Document shall be automatically reinstated and the Borrower
shall take such action as may be reasonably requested by the Pledgee and the Combined Secured
Parties to effect such reinstatement.
Section 7.07. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.
(a) This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different
counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall
constitute a single contract.
(b) This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to
fees payable to the Pledgee constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject
matter hereof and thereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings,
oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement and the other
Combined Loan Documents (other than the Combined Letters of Credit and the Letter of Credit
Agreements (as defined under each Credit Agreement)) represent the final agreement among the
parties hereto and thereto and may not be contradicted by evidence of prior, contemporaneous or
subsequent oral agreements of the parties. There are no unwritten oral agreements between the
parties.
(c) This Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Pledgee and
when the Pledgee shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken
17
together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, the Combined Lenders and their respective
successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this
Agreement by telecopy or any other electronic transmission (including via email or PDF) shall be

Section 7.08. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement or any other Combined Loan Document
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof or thereof; and the invalidity of a
particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

Agreement in the form of Annex I hereto and shall thereafter have the same rights, benefits and
obligations as a Pledgor party hereto on the date hereof. Each Pledgor that is required to pledge
additional Equity Interests of any Restricted Subsidiary shall execute and deliver a Supplement in
the form of Annex II hereto, if such Equity Interests were not previously pledged.
Section 7.14. Releases.
(a) Release Upon Payment in Full. The grant of a security interest hereunder and all of rights,
powers and remedies in connection herewith shall remain in full force and effect until the Secured
Obligations are Paid In Full In Cash, at which time such security interests shall automatically
terminate. Promptly following the Secured Obligations being Paid In Full In Cash, the Pledgee shall,
at the Borrower’s written request and expense, (i) retransfer and deliver all Collateral in its
possession to the Pledgors, and (ii) execute a written release or termination statement and
reassign to the Pledgors without recourse or warranty any remaining Collateral and all rights
conveyed hereby.
(b) Partial Releases. If any of the Collateral shall be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of by
any Pledgor in a transaction permitted by the Credit Agreements, then the Pledgee, at the request
and sole expense of such Pledgor, shall promptly execute and deliver to such Pledgor all releases
or other documents reasonably necessary or desirable for the release of the Liens created hereby
on such Collateral and the Equity Interests of the Issuer thereof. At the request and sole expense of
the Borrower, a Pledgor shall be released from its obligations hereunder in the event that all the
Equity Interests of such Pledgor shall be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of in a transaction
permitted by the Credit Agreements; provided that the Borrower shall have delivered to the
Pledgee, at least three (3) Business Days prior to the date of the proposed release (or such shorter
period as the Pledgee may agree), a written request of a Responsible Officer of the Borrower for
release identifying the relevant Pledgor, together with a certification by the Borrower stating that
such transaction is in compliance with the Credit Agreements and the other Combined Loan
Documents.
20
(c) Retention in Satisfaction. Except as may be expressly applicable pursuant to Section 9-620 of
the UCC, no action taken or omission to act by the Pledgee or the Combined Secured Parties
hereunder, including, without limitation, any exercise of voting or consensual rights or any other
action taken or inaction, shall be deemed to constitute a retention of the Collateral in satisfaction of
the Secured Obligations or otherwise to be in full satisfaction of the Secured Obligations, and the
Secured Obligations shall remain in full force and effect, until the Pledgee and the Combined
Secured Parties shall have applied payments (including, without limitation, collections from
Collateral) towards the Secured Obligations in the full amount then outstanding or until such
subsequent time as is provided in Section 7.14(a).
Section 7.15. Acceptance. Each Pledgor hereby expressly waives notice of acceptance of this
Agreement, acceptance on the part of the Pledgee and the Combined Secured Parties being
conclusively presumed by their request for this Agreement and delivery of the same to the
Pledgee.
Section 7.16. Intercreditor Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the provisions set forth
in this Agreement solely as they relate to the relative rights and obligations of the Pledgee and
other Combined Secured Parties in relation to one another and those set forth in the Intercreditor
Agreement, the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement shall supercede and control such
provisions of this Agreement.
