The Law

The Relevant Laws in this case are the Public Order Act (Cap 20) and The Public Emergency Regulation 2009.

The Public Order Act (Cap 20) is an Act for the Maintenance of Public Oder and provides for the guidelines and laws that need to be adhered to in holding public meetings, processions and gatherings. Section 8 of the Public Order Act requires that permits be obtained for meetings and processions in public place. It requires that:

"8.-(1) Any person who wishes to organize or convene a meeting or procession in a public place shall first make an application for a permit in that behalf to the appropriate authority and, unless such authority is satisfied for good reason that such a meeting or procession is likely to prejudice the maintenance of peace of good order, he shall issue a permit specifying-

(a) in the case of a procession, the purpose for which, and the routes of which, and the times at which, such procession may pass and such other conditions as he may think fit to impose;

(b) in the case of a meeting, the purpose for which and the place or times at or between which, such meeting may be held and such other conditions as he may think fit to impose; and

(c) the name or names of the person or persons to whom such permit is issued.

(2) Every person to whom a permit is issued under the provisions of subsection (1) shall be responsible for the due observance of all the conditions specified in the permit.

(3) Every application for a permit under the provisions of this section shall be made in writing to the appropriate authority at least seven days, or within such lesser time as he may specify in any particular case, prior to the date on which it is proposed to organize or convene a meeting or procession.

(4) The provisions of this section shall not apply to processions solely in connection with marriages or funerals.

(5) Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Act, any sporting, recreational or social event or fixture, any private entertainment, or any assembly for religious or charitable purposes, conducted with the permission of the local authority or other body or person having control of the public place in which such event, fixture, entertainment or assembly is held, shall be exempted from the provisions of this section.

The relevant part of the Public Emergency Regulation is Part II of the Public Emergency Regulation, which provides for the Powers for Maintaining Public Safety. Section 3 of the Regulation provides as follows: 

"3.(1) The Commissioner of Police or the Officer Commanding or the officer in charge of the Police District and, where necessary, in consultation with the local district officer, may by order prohibit absolutely or subject to such conditions as he or she may think fit any procession, meeting or assembly in any place, or building whether public or private notwithstanding the fact that a permit for such a procession, meeting or assembly may have already been granted.

(2) Any procession, meeting or assembly in any place whatsoever, whether or not any order shall have been made prohibiting such procession, meeting or assembly under the provisions of the last preceding paragraph, may be ordered to disperse by any police officer or any administrative officer, or any member of the Armed Forces of or above the rank of Sergeant, and it shall thereupon be the duty of the person taking part in such procession, meeting or assembly, to disperse accordingly.

(3) Any police officer or any member of the Armed Forces, if in his or her opinion such action is necessary for the public safety, after giving due warning, may use such force as he or she considers necessary, including the use of arms, to disperse the procession, meeting or assembly and to apprehend any person present thereat, and no police officer nor any member of the Armed Forces nor any person acting in aid of such police officer or member using such force shall be liable in criminal or civil proceedings for having by the use of such force caused harm or death to any person.

(4) Any person who organizes or assists in organizing any procession, meeting or assembly, held or intending to be held, in contravention of an order made under the provisions of this regulation, or who incites any person to take part in such procession, meeting or assembly, or who takes part in such a procession, meeting or assembly shall be guilty of an offence."

Section 20 of the Regulation deals with Obstruction of officers and provides that "any person who wilfully obstructs, knowingly misleads, or otherwise interferes with or impedes, or withholds any information in his or her possession which he or she may reasonably be required to furnish to, any officer or other person who is otherwise acting in accordance with his or her duty under these Regulations, shall be guilty of an offence against these Regulations."

The Penalty for breach of Public Emergency Regulations is provided in Section 25 of the Regulation  "Any person who is guilty of an offence under these Regulations shall be liable to a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars or to imprisonment for any terms not exceeding two years or to both such fine and imprisonment."

Burden and Standard of proof 

The burden of proof its case is on the Prosecution, the State. The prosecution is required to prove all the elements of the charge the accused are charged with beyond reasonable doubt. If the defence establishes to the Court's satisfaction that there is reasonable doubt, then the prosecution fails. 

Lord Denning in Miller v. Minister of Pensions, in commenting on the proof beyond reasonable doubt stated: "it need not reach certainty, but it must carry a high degree of probability. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond a shadow of doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If the evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility in his favour, which can be dismissed with the sentence 'of course it is possible but not in the least probable,' the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will suffice.".

Analysis of the Evidence

The Court has analysed all the evidence of all the witnesses in this case. The Court has also scrutinized all the documents that were tendered in this case. The Court has also noted the demeanor of all witnesses in this case The Court has taken note of the applicable laws in this case incuding, the Public Order Act (Cap 20) and the Public Emergency regulation 2009. 

There is no denying that a permit was issued for a public meeting for a Special General Meeting of the Management of the Andhra Sangam College on Sunday 29th November 2009 from 11 am to 4pm. The contention by the 1st prosecution witness is that the permit was cancelled and the meeting was therefore illegal and that the accused persons breached the Public Emergency Regulation. 

PW-1 is his evidence maintains that he had cancelled the meeting. He further informed the Court that he was sent by the Commissioner Western to suspend the meeting. The Court finds it difficult to reconcile the fact why would PW-1 proceed to suspend a meeting which he had cancelled.

In any event the Court has closely scrutinsed the evidence and finds that the accused never received any communication from PW-1 cancelling the meeting. If PW-1 had actually cancelled the meeting as per PE-2 (letter dated 26th November 2009) at the meeting on 27th November 209 with the 1st accused, Inspector Rusiate and others he should have given a copy to them. Inspector Rusiate an officer of long stead in Police Force, who was also the Station Officer at the time had no communication that the meeting was cancelled. His evidence is "DO agreed that meeting will go on. He said verbally that meeting is cancelled. No supporting letter for cancellation of the meeting. No letter to cancel the meeting. Sent Sgt Hemant to attend Meeting on Sunday. Did not get any notification of cancellation prior to time I sent Hemant". The Station officer had sent Sgt Hemant to the meeting on 29th November 2009, but he had no knowledge that the meeting had been cancelled. He had no communication stating that the meeting had been cancelled. Neither has the prosecution proven in this Court that the Officer In-Charge of the Police District (OCPD) had knowledge that the meeting was cancelled and he had acted accordingly. 

The Court further notes Regulation 3 (1) of the Public Emergency Regulations which provides that "The Commissioner of Police or the Officer Commanding or the officer in charge of the Police District and, where necessary, in consultation with the local district officer, may by order prohibit absolutely or subject to such conditions as he or she may think fit any procession, meeting or assembly in any place, or building whether public or private notwithstanding the fact that a permit for such a procession, meeting or assembly may have already been granted."

The evidence in this case does not show that The Commissioner of Police or the Officer Commanding or the officer in charge of the Police District prohibited or ordered dispersal from the meeting. In fact the Station Officer, the Senior Most Police Officer giving evidence in this case had no notification from the Commissioner of Police or the OCP prohibiting the meeting and ordering dispersal. The Station Officer went with the group to enquire about the meeting following the granting of the permit but they were not given any notification that the meeting had been cancelled. 

The Court has carefully scrutinsed all the evidence and finds that the evidence tendered does not support the charge and the evidence is unreliable as the District Officer who had purportedly cancelled the permit proceeded to suspend the meeting and clearly this cannot be overlooked.

Furthermore the 2nd count of obstruction against the 2nd accused is not supported by evidence beyond reasonable doubt. The Court notes inconsistencies between prosecution witnesses that 2nd accused circled Sgt Hemant and that he argued with Sgt Hemant. The inconsistencies do not support the prosecution case. 

Count 1: all accused are found not guilty

Count 2: accused 2 found not guilty

All the accused are acquitted of the respective charge. 

28 Days to appeal.
