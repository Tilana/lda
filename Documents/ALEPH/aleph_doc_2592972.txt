PART I
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Corporate Background
The  Company  was  originally  incorporated  on  December  8,  2006,  under  the  laws  of  the  State  of
Nevada as Elan Development, Inc.  On April 25, 2008, the name of the company was changed to
Star Gold Corp.   Star Gold Corp. is an exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition and
exploration  of  precious  metal  deposit  properties  and  advancing  them  toward  production.    The
Company is engaged in the business of exploring, evaluating and acquiring mineral prospects with
the potential for economic deposits of precious and base metals.
Star Gold Corp. currently leases with an option to acquire unpatented mining claims located in the
State of Nevada which in part make up what we refer to as the Longstreet Property. The Longstreet
Property in its entirety comprises 125 mineral claims (75 original optioned claims, of which 70 are
unpatented staked claims and five claims leased from local ranchers, as well as 50 recently staked
claims by Star Gold, covering a total area of approximately 2,500 acres (1,012 ha). The Longstreet
property is at an intermediate stage of exploration.
The  Company  has  no  patents,  licenses,  franchises  or  concessions  which  are  considered  by  the
Company  to  be  of  importance.    The  business  is  not  of  a  seasonal  nature.    Since  the  potential
products are traded in the open market, the Company has no control over the competitive conditions
in the industry.
Overview of Mineral Exploration and Current Operations
Star  Gold  Corp.  is  an  exploration  stage  mineral  company  with  no  producing  mines.    Mineral
exploration is essentially a research activity that does not produce a product.  As such the Company
acquires  properties  which  it  believes  have  potential  to  host  economic  concentrations  of  minerals,
particularly gold and silver.  These acquisitions have and may take the form of unpatented mining
claims on federal land, or leasing claims, or private property owned by others.  An unpatented mining
claim is an interest that can be acquired to the mineral rights on open lands of the federal owned
public domain.  Claims are staked in accordance with the Mining Law of 1872, recorded with the
federal  government  pursuant  to  laws  and  regulations  established  by  the  Bureau  of  Land
Management.   The Company intends to remain in the business of exploring for mining properties
that have the potential to produce gold, silver, base metals and other commodities.
The Company will perform basic geological work to identify specific drill targets on the properties,
and  then  collect  subsurface  samples  by  drilling  to  confirm  the  presence  of  mineralization  (the
presence of economic minerals in a specific area or geological formation).  The Company may enter
into joint venture agreements with other companies to fund further exploration and/or development
work.  It is the Company’s plan to focus on assembling a high quality group of mid-stage mineral
(primarily  gold  and  silver)  exploration  prospects,  using  the  experience  and  contacts  of  the
management group.  By such prospects, the Company means properties that have been previously
identified  by  third  parties,  (including  prior  owners  and/or  exploration  companies),  as  mineral
prospects  with  potential  for  economic  mineralization.    Often  these  properties  have  been  sampled,
mapped and sometimes drilled, usually with indefinite results.  Accordingly, such acquired projects
will have either prior exploration history or will have strong similarity to a recognized geologic ore
deposit model.  Geographic emphasis will be place on the western United States.
The geologic potential and ore deposit models have been defined and specific drill targets identified
the Company’s sole remaining property.  The Company’s property evaluation process involves using
basic geologic fieldwork to perform an initial evaluation of a property.  If the evaluation is positive, the
Company seeks to acquire, either by staking unpatented mining claims on open public domain, or by
leasing  the  property  from  the  owner  of  private  property  or  the  owner  of  unpatented  claims.    Once
acquired,  the  Company  then  typically  makes  a  more  detailed  evaluation  of  the  property.    This
detailed  evaluation  involves  expenditures  for  exploration  work  which  may  include  rock  and  soil
sampling, geologic mapping, geophysics, trenching, drilling or other means to determine if economic
mineralization is present on a property.

Compliance with Government Regulations
Continuing  to  acquire  and  explore  mineral  properties  in  the  State  of  Nevada  will  be  require  the
Company  to  comply  with  all  regulations,  rules  and  directives  of  governmental  authorities  and
agencies  applicable  to  the  exploration  of  minerals  in  the  State  of  Nevada  and  the  United  States
Federal agencies.
United States
Mining in the State of Nevada is subject to federal, state and local law. Three types of laws are of
particular importance to the Company’s U.S. mineral properties: those affecting land ownership and
mining rights; those regulating mining operations; and those dealing with the environment.
Land Ownership and Mining Rights.
On Federal Lands, mining rights are governed by the General Mining Law of 1872 (General Mining
Law)  as  amended,  30  U.S.C.  §§  21-161  (various  sections),  which  allows  the  location  of  mining
claims  on  certain  Federal  Lands  upon  the  discovery  of  a  valuable  mineral  deposit  and  proper
compliance with claim location requirements. A valid mining claim provides the holder with the right
to conduct mining operations for the removal of locatable minerals, subject to compliance with the
General Mining Law and Nevada state law governing the staking and registration of mining claims,
as  well  as  compliance  with  various  federal,  state  and  local  operating  and  environmental  laws,
regulations and ordinances. As the owner or lessee of the unpatented mining claims, the Company
has the right to conduct mining operations on the lands subject to the prior procurement of required
operating permits and approvals, compliance with the terms and conditions of any applicable mining
lease, and compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations and ordinances.
Mining Operations
The exploration of mining properties and development and operation of mines is governed by both
federal and state laws.
The State of Nevada likewise requires various permits and approvals before mining operations can
begin, although the state and federal regulatory agencies usually cooperate to minimize duplication
of  permitting  efforts.  Among  other  things,  a  detailed  reclamation  plan  must  be  prepared  and
approved, with bonding in the amount of projected reclamation costs. The bond is used to ensure that
proper  reclamation  takes  place,  and  the  bond  will  not  be  released  until  that  time.  The  Nevada
Department of Environmental Protection, which is referred to as the NDEP, is the state agency that
administers the reclamation permits, mine permits and related closure plans on the Nevada property.
Local  jurisdictions  (such  as  Eureka  County)  may  also  impose  permitting  requirements  (such  as
conditional use permits or zoning approvals).
Environmental Law
The  development,  operation,  closure,  and  reclamation  of  mining  projects  in  the  United  States
requires numerous notifications, permits, authorizations, and public agency decisions. Compliance
with  environmental  and  related  laws  and  regulations  requires  us  to  obtain  permits  issued  by
regulatory  agencies,  and  to  file  various  reports  and  keep  records  of  the  Company’s  operations.
Certain of these permits require periodic renewal or review of their conditions and may be subject to
a  public  review  process  during  which  opposition  to  the  Company’s  proposed  operations  may  be
encountered. The Company is currently operating under various permits for activities connected to
mineral  exploration,  reclamation,  and  environmental  considerations.  Unless  and  until  a  mineral
resource is proved, it is
Page 5 of 58
unlikely  Star  Gold  Corp.  operations  will  move  beyond  the  exploration  stage.  If  in  the  future  the
Company  decides  to  proceed  beyond  exploration,  there  will  be  numerous  notifications,  permit
applications, and other decisions to be addressed at that time.
Competition
Star Gold Corp. competes with other mineral resource exploration and development companies for
financing and for the acquisition of new mineral properties and also for equipment and labor related
to exploration and development of mineral properties. Many of the mineral resource exploration and
development  companies  with  whom  the  Company  competes  have  greater  financial  and  technical
resources.    Accordingly,  competitors  may  be  able  to  spend  greater  amounts  on  acquisitions  of
mineral  properties  of  merit,  on  exploration  of  their  mineral  properties  and  on  development  of  their
mineral properties. In addition, they may be able to afford greater geological expertise in the targeting
and  exploration  of  mineral  properties.  This  competition  could  result  in  competitors  having  mineral
properties  of  greater  quality  and  interest  to  prospective  investors  who  may  finance  additional
exploration and development. This competition could adversely impact Star Gold Corp.’s ability to
finance further exploration and to achieve the financing necessary for the Company to develop its
mineral properties.
The  Company  provides  no  assurance  it  will  be  able  to  compete  in  any  of  its  business  areas
effectively with current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures faced by the Company
will not have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and operating results.
Office and Other Facilities
Star  Gold  Corp.  currently  maintains  its  administrative  offices  at  611  E.  Sherman  Avenue,  Coeur
d'Alene, ID  83814.  The telephone number is (208) 664-5066.  Star Gold Corp. does not currently
own title to any real property.
Employees
The Company has no employees other than its executive officers as of the date of this Annual Report
on  Form  10-K.  Star  Gold  Corp.  conducts  business  largely  through  independent  contractor
agreements with consultants.
Research and Development Expenditures
The Company has not incurred any research expenditures since incorporation.
Reports to Security Holders
The Registrant does not issue annual or quarterly reports to security holders other than the annual
Form 10-K and quarterly Forms 10-Q as electronically filed with the SEC.  Electronically filed reports
may  be  accessed  at www.sec.gov.  Interested parties also may read and copy any materials filed
with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 450 Fifth Street NW, Washington, DC 20549.
 Information may be obtained on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at
(800) SEC-0330.
ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORS
The following factors, among others, could cause the actual operating results to differ materially from
those indicated or suggested by forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-K or presented
elsewhere from time to time.
Estimates  of  mineralized  material  are  forward-looking  statements  inherently  subject  to  error.
 Although resource estimates require a high degree of assurance in the underlying data when the
estimates are made, unforeseen events and uncontrollable factors can have significant adverse or
positive  impacts  on  the  estimates.    Actual  results  may  inherently  differ  from  estimates.    The
unforeseen and uncontrollable factors include but are not limited to:  geologic uncertainties including
inherent sample variability, metal price fluctuations, variations in mining and processing parameters,
and adverse changes in environmental or mining laws and regulations.  The timing and effects of
variances from estimated values cannot be accurately predicted.
Failure to successfully address the risks and uncertainties described below would have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and/or results of operations, and the
trading price of the Company’s common stock may decline and
Page 6 of 58
investors may lose all or part of their investment.  Star Gold Corp. cannot assure readers that the
Company will successfully address these risks or other unknown risks that may affect its business.
Risks Related to the Company
The Company has a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of the business
and prospects
The  Company  has  not  derived  any  revenue  from  exploration  of  its  properties.    The  Company’s
operating  history  has  been  limited  to  the  acquisition  and  exploration  of  mineral  properties.  Such
history does not provide a meaningful basis for an evaluation of its prospects for success if future
determinations are made that mineral reserves exist and to commence construction and operation of
a  mine.    Other  than  through  conventional  and  typical  exploration  methods  and  procedures,  the
Company has no additional means to evaluate the likelihood of whether its mineral property contains
any mineral reserve or, if they do, that it will be operated successfully.  The Company anticipates that
it will continue to incur operating costs without realizing any operating revenues during the period it
explores existing and any future acquired properties.
During the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $420,444 in connection
with the maintenance and exploration of its mineral properties and the operation of the exploration
business.  The Company therefore expects to continue to incur significant losses into the foreseeable
future.    The  Company  recognizes  that  if  it  is  unable  to  generate  significant  revenues  from  mining
operations and dispositions of its properties, the Company will not be able to earn profits or continue
operations.  At this early stage of operations, the Company expects to face the risks, uncertainties,
expenses  and  difficulties  frequently  encountered  by  companies  at  the  development  stage  of  their
business.    The  Company  cannot  ensure  it  will  be  successful  in  addressing  these  risks  and
uncertainties and the failure to do so could have a materially adverse effect on its financial condition.
 There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that the Company will
prove successful and the Company can provide investors no assurance that we will generate any
operating revenue or ever achieve profitable operations.
Investors’ interests in the Company will be diluted and investors may suffer dilution in their
net  book  value  per  share  if  the  Company  issues  additional  employee/director/consultant
options or if the Company sells additional shares to finance its operation.
The Company has not generated any operational revenues from the exploration of any properties.  In
order to further expand the Company’s business and meet its objectives, including but not limited to,
obtaining  funds  to  further  explore  the  Company’s  existing  properties  or  to  finance  any  acquisition
activity,  growth  and/or  additional  exploration  programs,  should  those  opportunities  present
themselves, and depending on the outcome of its exploration programs, additional capital funding
may need to be obtained through the sale and issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities.
   The Company may also, in the future, grant to some or all of its directors, officers, insiders and key
employee/consultants options, or other rights to acquire common or preferred shares in the Company
as non-cash incentives.  The issuance of any additional equity securities could cause then-existing
stockholders to experience dilution of their ownership interests.
Should  the  Company  issue  additional  shares  in  order  to  finance  its  business  activities,  investors’
interests in the Company may be diluted and investors may suffer dilution in their net book value per
share depending on the price at which such securities are sold.  As of the date of the filing of this
report there are outstanding 5,855,400 common share purchase warrants exercisable into 5,855,400
shares of common stock, and 3,083,667 options granted that are exercisable into 3,083,667 shares of
common  stock.    If  all  of  these  are  exercised  or  converted,  these  would  represent  approximately
18.0%  of  the  Company’s  issued  and  outstanding  shares.    If  all  of  the  warrants  and  options  are
exercised  and  the  underlying  shares  issued,  such  issuance  would  cause  a  reduction  in  the
proportionate  ownership  and  voting  power  of  all  other  stockholders.    The  dilution  may  result  in  a
decline in the market price of the Company’s shares.
Conflicts of interest
Certain of the Company’s officers and directors may be or become associated with other businesses,
including natural resource companies that acquire interests in properties.  Such associations may
give rise to conflicts of interests from time to time.  The Company’s directors are required by law to act
honestly and in good faith with a view to the Company’s best interests and to disclose any interest,
which they may have in any of the Company’s projects or opportunities.  In general, if a conflict of
interest arises at a meeting of the board of directors, any director in a conflict will disclose his interest
and abstain from voting on such matter or, if he does vote, his vote will not be counted.
Page 7 of 58
Dependence on Key Management Personnel
The  Company’s  ability  to  continue  exploration  and  development  activities  and  to  develop  a
competitive  edge  in  the  marketplace  depends,  in  large  part,  on  its  ability  to  attract  and  maintain
qualified key management personnel.  Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be
no assurance that the Company will be able to attract and retain such personnel.  The Company’s
development  now  and  in  the  future  will  depend  on  the  effort  of  key  management  figures  such  as
Lindsay Gorrill, Kelly Stopher, and David Segelov.  The loss of any of these key people could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s business.  In addition, the Company has expanded the
provisions of its stock option plan so the Company can provide incentive for the key personnel.
Failure to obtain additional financing
Unless and until the Company is able to generate revenues from operations, the Company’s main
potential continuing source of funds will be additional debt and/or equity financings which may not be
sufficient to sustain operations.  There is no guarantee that the Company, if needed, will be able to
raise additional funds through debt and/or equity financing or that any such financing will be able to
be  obtained  on  terms  beneficial  to  the  Company.  If  Star  Gold  Corp.  is  unsuccessful  in  raising
additional  funds,  the  Company  will  not  be  able  to  develop  its  properties  and  may  be  unable  to
continue as a going concern.
Company  Directors  and  Officers  own17,067,511  shares  of  the  Company’s  outstanding
common stock (41.8%) which may cause corporate decisions influenced by the Directors and
Officers to appear to be inconsistent with the interests of other stockholders.
Company  directors  and/or  officers  as  a  group  control  a  combined  41.8%%  of  the  issued  and
outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock.  Accordingly, while none of the current directors
and/or officers (individually or collectively) can control, as shareholders, who is elected to the board
of directors, since these individuals are not simply passive investors but are also active members of
Company management, their interests as directors and/or officers and shareholders may, at times, be
adverse to those interests of merely passive investors. Where those conflicts exist, stockholders will
be  dependent  upon  management  exercising  their  fiduciary  duties  as  members  of  the  Board  of
Directors and/or as an officer. Also, due to their stock ownership position, members of the Company’s
management team will have: (i) the ability to substantially influence the outcome of many (if not most)
corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including amendments to the Company’s Articles of
Incorporation;  and  (ii)  the  ability  to  substantially  influence  corporate  combinations  or  similar
transactions that might benefit minority stockholders which may not be supported by management to
the detriment of smaller and/or passive investors.
There  is  substantial  risk  that  no  commercially  viable  mineral  deposits  will  be  found  due  to
speculative nature of mineral exploration,
Exploration for commercially viable mineral deposits is a speculative venture involving substantial
risk.  Star  Gold  cannot  provide  investors  with  assurance  that  any  of  its  mining  claim  contains
commercially viable mineral deposits. The exploration program that the Company will conduct on its
claim  may  not  result  in  the  discovery  of  commercial  viable  mineral  deposits.  Problems  such  as
unusual  and  unexpected  rock  formations  and  other  conditions  are  involved  in  mineral  exploration
and often result in unsuccessful exploration efforts. In such a case, the Company may be unable to
complete its business plan and investors could lose their entire investment.
Due to the inherent dangers involved in mineral exploration, there is a risk that the Company
may incur liability or damages as it conducts its business.
The  search  for  minerals  involves  numerous  hazards.  As  a  result,  Star  Gold  Corp.  may  become
subject to liability for such hazards, including pollution, cave-ins and other hazards against which the
Company cannot insure or against which we may elect not to insure. Star Gold Corp. currently has no
such insurance nor does the Company expect to acquire such insurance for the foreseeable future. If
a hazard were to occur, the costs of rectifying the hazard may exceed the Company’s asset value
and  cause  management  to  liquidate  all  of  the  Company’s  assets  resulting  in  the  loss  of  a
stockholder’s entire investment.
Exploration efforts may be adversely affected by metals price volatility causing the Company
to cease exploration efforts.
The Company has no earnings from operations.  However, the success of any exploration effort is
derived  from  the  price  of  metal  prices  that  are  affected  by  numerous  factors  including:    1)
expectations for inflation; 2) investor speculative activities: 3) relative exchange rate of the U.S. dollar
to other currencies; 4) global and regional demand and production; 5) global and regional political
and
Page 8 of 58
economic conditions; and 6) production costs in major producing regions.  These factors are beyond
the Company’s control and are impossible for the Company to accurately predict.
There  is  no  guarantee  that  current  favorable  prices  for  metals  and  other  commodities  will  be
sustained.  If the market prices for these commodities fall the Company may temporarily suspend or
cease exploration efforts.
Governmental regulation and environmental risks
The  Company’s  business  is  subject  to  extensive  federal,  state  and  local  laws  and  regulations
governing mining exploration, development, production, labor standards, occupational health, waste
disposal, use of toxic substances, environmental regulations, mine safety and other matters.  New
legislation and regulations may be adopted at any time that results in additional operating expense,
capital expenditures or restrictions and delays in the exploration, mining, production or development
of its properties
Internal control, fraud detection and financial reporting
Should the Company fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, it may not be able to
detect fraud or report financial results accurately, which could harm the business and could subject
the Company to regulatory scrutiny.
Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”), the Company is required
to  perform  an  evaluation  of  the  effectiveness  of  its  internal  controls  over  financial  reporting.    The
Company is not required to have an independent registered public accounting firm test and evaluate
the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  such  internal  controls  and  publicly  attest  to  such
evaluation.    Continuing  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  Section  404  is  expected  to  be
expensive  and  time-consuming.      Failure  to  implement  required  new  or  improved  controls,  or
difficulties  encountered  in  their  implementation,  could  harm  the  Company’s  operating  results  or
cause the Company to fail to meet its reporting obligations.
Risks Associated with the Company’s Common Stock
Star Gold Corp. stock is a penny stock; stockholders will be more limited in their ability to sell
their stock.
The shares of Star Gold Corp. common stock constitute “penny stocks” under the Exchange Act. The
shares  will  remain  classified  as  a  penny  stock  for  the  foreseeable  future.  The  classification  as  a
penny stock makes it more difficult for a broker/dealer to sell the stock into a secondary market, which
makes it more difficult for a purchaser to liquidate his or her investment. Any broker/dealer engaged
by the purchaser for the purpose of selling his or her shares will be subject to rules 15g-1 through
15g-10 of the Exchange Act. Rather than having to comply with these rules, some broker-dealers will
refuse to attempt to sell a penny stock.
The "penny stock" rules adopted by the SEC under the Exchange Act subjects the sale of the shares
of the Company’s common stock to certain regulations which impose sales practice requirements on
broker/dealers.  For  example,  brokers/dealers  selling  such  securities  must,  prior  to  effecting  the
transaction,  provide  their  customers  with  a  document  that  discloses  the  risks  of  investing  in  such
securities.
Legal remedies, which may be available to an investor in "penny stocks,” are as follows:
(a)
(b)
(c)
if  "penny  stock"  is  sold  to  an  investor  in  violation  of  his  or  her  rights  listed  above,  or  other
federal or states securities laws, the investor may be able to cancel his or her purchase and get
his or her money back.
 
if the stocks are sold in a fraudulent manner, the investor may be able to sue the persons and
firms that caused the fraud for damages.
 
if the investor has signed an arbitration agreement, however, he or she may have to pursue his
or her claim through arbitration.
If  the  person  purchasing  the  securities  is  someone  other  than  an  accredited  investor  or  an
established  customer  of  the  broker/dealer,  the  broker/dealer  must  also  approve  the  potential
customer's account by obtaining information concerning the customer's financial situation, investment
experience and investment objectives. The broker/dealer must also make a determination whether
the transaction is suitable for the customer and whether the customer has sufficient knowledge and
experience  in  financial  matters  to  be  reasonably  expected  to  be  capable  of  evaluating  the  risk  of
transactions  in  such  securities.  Accordingly,  the  SEC's  rules  may  limit  the  number  of  potential
purchasers of the shares of Star Gold Corp. common stock.
Page 9 of 58
The Company’s stock price has been volatile and stockholder investment in the Company’s
common stock could suffer a decline in value.
The Company’s common stock is quoted via the OTC Markets.  The market price of the Company’s
common  stock  may  fluctuate  significantly  in  response  to  a  number  of  factors,  some  of  which  are
beyond  the  Company’s  control.    These  factors  include  price  fluctuations  of  precious  metals,
government  regulations,  disputes  regarding  mining  claims,  broad  stock  market  fluctuations  and
economic conditions in the United States.
Although  the  Company’s  common  stock  is  currently  quoted  via  the  OTC  Markets,  there  are  no
assurances any public market for the Company’s common stock will continue.  There are also no
assurances as to the depth or liquidity of any such market or the prices at which holders may be able
to sell the shares.  An investment in these shares may be totally illiquid and investors may not be
able to liquidate their investment readily or at all when they need or desire to sell.
The Company does not intend to pay any dividends on shares of common stock in the near
future.
The Company does not currently anticipate declaring and paying dividends to its stockholders in the
near future, and any future decision as to the payment of dividends will be at the discretion of the
board  of  directors  and  will  depend  upon  the  Company’s  earnings,  financial  position,  capital
requirements, plans for expansion and such other factors as the board of directors deems relevant.  It
is  the  Company’s  intention  to  apply  net  earnings,  if  any,  in  the  foreseeable  future  to  finance  the
growth and development of the business.
ITEM 1B.   UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
None
ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES.
The Company headquarters are located at 611 E. Sherman Avenue, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, 83814.
 The Company believes this office space and facilities are sufficient to meet the Company's present
needs, and do not anticipate any difficulty securing alternative or additional space, as needed, on
terms acceptable to the Company.
The Company currently does not own any real property.   The Company owns a vehicle for business
use in Nevada and other personal property used in the conduct of the Company’s business at its
headquarters and at its various holdings in Nevada.
The Company is an exploration stage company with no proven or measured mineral reserves. There
is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists at the Longstreet Property.  Further
exploration and will be required before any final determination as to the economic or legal feasibility
may be made as to the Company’s property.
THE LONGSTREET PROPERTY
In January of 2010 Star Gold signed an option agreement to lease with an option to acquire from
MinQuest,  60  unpatented  mining  claims  (the  “Longstreet  Property”)  totaling  approximately  490
hectares (the “Longstreet Agreement”). The Company completed its first phase of drilling in 2011. On
July 9, 2010, the Company and MinQuest entered into an amended agreement to add an additional
10 claims and expanded the total to 70 claims, all of which are unpatented. In addition, Star Gold
reimburses MinQuest for 5 claims leased from a third party, Roy Clifford. The property comprises 125
mineral  claims  (75  original  optioned  claims,  of  which  70  are  unpatented  staked  claims  and  five
claims acquired from local ranchers (Roy Clifford et al)), as well as 50 recently staked claims by Star
Gold, covering a total area of approximately 2,500 acres (1,012 ha) (Figure 6-1).  The claims are
located  within  Sections  9-17,  20,  and  21  of  T6N,  R47E,  MDB&M  (Mount  Diablo  Base  Line  &
Meridian), Nye County.
Star Gold has staked 38 of these claims (Leach Pad Claims) adjacent to the eastern boundary of the
property, with the objective of providing a site for leach pads planned for future development of the
Main Zone.  In addition, Star Gold has staked 12 of the above claims along a corridor leading from
the main Longstreet property to the Leach Pad Claims.

Star Gold must make annual claim filing fees of $176.08 ($165 in 2015) per claim with the Bureau of
Land Management (BLM), and Nevada/Nye County claim filing fees of $10.50 per claim plus $4.00
for filing with the Nye County office at Tonopah.  The 2016 annual claim payments totaled $20,691.
The terms of the amended Longstreet Agreement called for an initial cash payment of $20,000, the
issuance of 25,000 stock options based on “fair market price” to MinQuest on or about January 16,
2016.  The amended Longstreet Agreement also requires cash payments totaling $230,000 over five
years and 160,000 stock options based on “fair market price” over the same seven-year period.  The
Company  has  agreed  to  work  commitments  of  $1,650,000  over  five  years.    Following  the  fifth
anniversary of the amended agreement and if commitments have been met Star Gold shall receive a
quitclaim deed for a 100% interest in the Longstreet Property covered by the Longstreet Agreement,
as amended, in consideration of an ongoing 3% NSR to MinQuest.
The Longstreet project is located 48 kilometers southeast of the Round Mountain Mine in Nevada.
 Longstreet is a Round Mountain style volcanic-hosted gold deposit. The first vein mapping program
ever  done  at  Longstreet  was  completed  in  October,  2002.  This  work  disclosed  that  gold-bearing
veins at Main, as well as 6 other targets in the project area are steeply dipping. Most of the previous
drilling was vertical. This indicates high potential to increase continuity, tonnage and grade of the
resource. Surface geochemical sampling of veins from all the currently defined targets found gold
values up to 18.1 g/t.  As at Round Mountain the property contains

strong potential for both open pit heap-leachable and high-grade millable ore.  No party reading this
report  should  conclude  the  Longstreet  property  has  economic  mineralization  due  to  Longstreet's
proximity to Round Mountain.  Comparison to this and other historic or producing mines is strictly
informational relative to location and similar geologic characteristics.
History:  The Longstreet Property was discovered in the early 1900’s, but had limited development
work until 1929.  A 1929 report and maps show development of the “Golden Lion Mine” on two levels
spaced  75  meters  apart  vertically.    The  report  indicates  development  of  300,000  tons  of  “vein
material” averaging 0.20 oz./ton (6.8 g/t) gold and 8 oz./ton (274 g/t) silver.  A mill was constructed,
the remnants of which are still on the property.  However, the small stopes underground indicate very
little mining was done and the operation was abandoned.
The property lay idle until 1980 when Keradamex Inc. and E & B Exploration formed a joint venture to
explore  the  property.    The  venture  conducted  soil  and  rock  chip  geochemical  surveys,  limited
underground sampling and drilled seven (one was abandoned) angle core holes into the Main mine
workings area.  This drilling revealed the presence of fracture related gold mineralization up to 36
meters  thick  extending  into  the  hanging  wall  of  the  vein  structure.

In 1982 Minerva Exploration optioned the property and initiated an underground sampling program.
  In  1983  a  joint  venture  was  formed  with  Geomex  Canada  Resources  Ltd.  Derry,  Michener,  and
Booth  were  commissioned  to  assess  the  property  and  conducted  underground  sampling,  bulk
sampling and metallurgical testing.
In early 1984 Naneco Resources Ltd., an Alberta company, acquired all of the assets of Minerva and
an additional 10 percent interest in the property from Geomex.  As operator, Naneco immediately
initiated drilling.  In 1985, with over 200 RC holes drilled the venture announced encouraging results
with anomalous grades of gold and silver throughout its drilling samples.
During the next few years Naneco increased its interest from 53 percent to 100 percent, conducted
additional metallurgy, economic evaluation and drilling.  At least 492 RC holes have been drilled,
most  within  the  Main  resource  area.    Unable  to  raise  money  because  of  falling  gold  prices  and
strapped with high land payments to the claim owners, Naneco relinquished the property in 1998. 
MinQuest acquired it shortly thereafter. The Cyprus target, which was evaluated by Cyprus Minerals
Company in 1987 was acquired by MinQuest in early 2002.
The property was optioned to Rare Earth Metals Corp. (REM) in May of 2002. REM later changed its
name to Harvest Gold. Mapping and geochemical sampling of the 7 targets shown on the attached
map  was  completed  in  October,  2002.  From  2003  through  2005  REM  drilled  30  holes  into  Main
totaling 3,350 meters. The drill holes were angled toward the intersection of the two primary sheeted
vein sets. Results showed a 20% improvement in average grade over vertical drilling.
Following the split of REM into Harvest Gold and VMS Ventures Inc. Harvest performed no further
work at Longstreet after late 2005. The property was finally returned to MinQuest in August, 2009. By
agreement with Minquest, On January 15, 2010 Star Gold Corp. received an option to acquire the
portions of the property covered by the option.
Star Gold began drilling in the fall of 2011. A 16-hole program at Main showed new intercepts at
depth  in  the  central  portion  of  the  deposit.  Intercept  thicknesses  of  +0.01  oz./ton  gold  equivalent
values are 65 to 120 feet. Of the 16 holes drilled 8 have +100 feet thicknesses of +0.01 oz./ton gold
equivalent and 4 have +200 feet thicknesses of +0.01 oz./ton gold equivalent. Drill hole LS-1101 has
305  feet  of  +0.01  oz./ton  gold  equivalent.  Gold  equivalent  values  were  derived  from  the  following
formula: AuEq oz./ton = Au oz./ton + (Ag oz./ton)/60. Drilling results are shown in the table below.
Drill samples were sent through a rotating, wet sample splitter attached to the drill in order to reduce
the sample volume and maintain a representative sample. Drill helpers, under the supervision of the
project geologist, collected and bagged an 'A' and 'B' sample on 5-foot intervals. Procedurally, an 'A'
sample is collected and held by the project geologist for security purposes until it can be delivered to
an assay facility. The 'B' sample then remains on site as a duplicate or backup sample if needed at a
later date. A blank and two known 'standard’ pulps are then submitted randomly spaced with each
drill hole. Once assays are available, they are examined for unexpected high or low values. If
unexpected high or low values are encountered, the 'B' splits may be collected and submitted, or the
lab may be requested to re-assay the pulp or reject in question. The 'check' samples and 'standard'
are examined to insure they agree with the original or know within accepted limits, usually +or- 10%.
ALS Chemex of Reno, Nevada did all sample preparation, including crushing, grinding and
preparation of the assay pulps. The samples were never left unattended or unsecured by project
geologist, drilling or laboratory staff nor are they handled by officers, directors or associates of Star
Gold.
Sample preparation involves crushing the entire sample to -10 mesh, splitting, then pulverizing 1,000
grams to 75% passing 75-micron mesh. These pulps are then transferred within the ALS Chemex
facility for assay. Both gold and silver assays are done by fire assay with an AA finish.  The standard
Star-Longstreet submittal to ALS Chemex requests a 30-gram charge for gold fire assay. Assays
which exceed 10 g/ton are automatically subjected to a gravimetric finish.  Select sample intervals,
usually those near intervals assaying significant gold, are chosen by the project geologist for re-
assay also.
The  Longstreet  project  is  associated  with  a  paleo-hot  springs  system  in  a  caldera  associated
volcanic setting very similar to the Round Mountain mine. Round Mountain is an open pit, heap-leach
mine that has produced over 10 million ounces of gold over a 30-year period with the average grade
currently being mined of 0.018 oz./ton gold.  Cut-off grades for Round Mountain and several other
oxide ore heap leach operations in Nevada range from 0.003 to 0.005 oz./ton gold.  Star Gold hopes
to develop an open pit, bulk minable, heap leachable gold/silver mine at Longstreet.
No party reading this report should conclude the Longstreet property has economic mineralization
due to Longstreet's proximity to any historic or producing mines and any information regarding any
such  historic  or  producing  mines  is  strictly  informational  relative  to  location  and  similar  geologic
characteristics.

Regional Geology and Mineralization: The Longstreet Property is located in the Nevada portion of
the Basin and Range Province. This geological province is characterized by repeated episodes of
compressional  deformation  in  Paleozoic  and  Mesozoic  time  followed  by  extensional  deformation
and extensive magmatism and volcanism in Cenozoic time. Gold deposits are most often described
as being associated with ‘mineralization trends’ that are a reflection of deep crustal structures and
magmatism, such as the ‘Walker Lane’ and the ‘Carlin Trend’. The Longstreet Project is located in
the Monitor Range, adjacent to the northwest trending Walker Lane volcanic-hosted gold trend that
includes such world-class deposits as the Comstock and Goldfields mining camps

The Monitor Range is a westward-tilted fault block that has been elevated by normal faults along its
eastern front, and is typical of the uplifted mountains of the Basin and Range Province. The ranges
are  topographic  highs  rising  above  alluvium-filled  valleys  generated  by  Tertiary  extensional
tectonics.  Central  Nevada  was  an  area  of  intense  Oligocene  –  Miocene  ash-flow  volcanism  that
created  numerous  calderas  and  their  outflow  products.  At  least  13  calderas  that  range  in  age
between 32 and 22 Ma have been mapped or interpreted in the area extending from the Shoshone
Mountains eastward to the Monitor Range.  The southern Monitor Range consists Mainly of Tertiary
age  volcanics  and  hypabyssal  rocks  related  to  the  eruption  of  the  Big  Ten  Peak  volcano  and  a
nearby  unnamed  29  Ma  caldera  (Kleinhampl  and  Ziony,  1985)  intruding  and  overlying  Paleozoic
sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.
The Paleozoic rocks are thrust-faulted marine sedimentary rocks comprised of quartzite, argillite and
limestone of Cambrian, Ordovician and Silurian age. Minor amounts of Permian marine sediments
are also present in the Georges Canyon area.
In the southern Monitor Range Tertiary age volcanic rocks comprise more than 90% of the exposed
bedrock. These rocks are more than 1 km thick and are predominantly flat-lying. Early Oligocene to
early Miocene rhyolitic to dacitic ash-flow tuffs, with rhyolitic welded tuff are the thickest and most
extensive units. Most of the Tertiary intrusions in the region are rhyolitic, but several small dacitic to
andesitic dikes are present in the Georges Canyon area.
Mineral deposits in this part of the Basin and Range Province are varied and widespread and some
of  them  have  (had)  substantial  metal  production.  The  producing  Round  Mountain  gold  deposit  is
about 25 miles northwest, and the past-producing Manhattan Mining Camp (gold/silver) is about 20
miles west-northwest of the Longstreet Property.
The Round Mountain Mine is a giant among epithermal precious metal deposits hosted by volcanic
rocks, and the mineralization is a classic example of low sulphidation epithermal gold mineralization
(White and Hedenquist, 1995). Gold deposits were discovered at Round Mountain in 1906 (Shawe,
1982) and by 1959 about 410 thousand ounces (troy ounces) of gold had been produced from placer
and narrow vein lode deposits. Current production by open-pit mining methods commenced in 1977.
Kinross  (2010)  reported  an  annual  production  for  2010  at  184,554  ounces  of  AuEq,  with  over  66
million tons of proven and probable reserves.
The oxidized ore is described as a closely spaced set of steeply dipping veins and veinlets following
northwest-trending faults and associated joints over broad areas. Significant gold mineralization is
not found in northeast-trending faults and fractures. The vein/veinlet system contains quartz, adularia,
limonite  (oxidized  from  pyrite),  manganese  oxide  and  associated  native  free  gold.  Flat  veins  are
similar  to  the  steep  veins  in  character  and  mineral  content,  but  with  more  brecciation  of  the  wall
rocks. Gold contents also appear to be higher in the flat veins. The adularia in the ore related veins is
dated at 25.9 to 26.6 Ma, which is indistinguishable from
Page 18 of 58
the age of the enclosing ‘Tuffs of Round Mountain’ welded ash flow tuffs. These tuffs were erupted
from the Round Mountain caldera and were deposited within the caldera (Henry, Castor and Elson,
1996).
No party reading this report should conclude the Longstreet property has economic mineralization
due to Longstreet's proximity to any historic or producing mines and any information regarding any
such  historic  or  producing  mines  is  strictly  informational  relative  to  location  and  similar  geologic
characteristics.
Hydrothermal alteration associated with the bulk mineable ore is evidenced by silicification and the
replacement  of  magmatic  feldspar  by  hydrothermal  feldspar  engendered  by  a  potassium-rich
hydrothermal fluid (Sander, 1988).
The Manhattan gold / silver camp is located approximately 20 miles west-northwest of the Longstreet
Mine  and  is  an  example  of  Tertiary  epithermal  mineralization  superimposed  on  Paleozoic
sedimentary rocks. Gold / silver deposits were discovered at Manhattan in 1905 (Shawe, 1982) and
by 1959 about 10,500 kg of gold and 4,400 kg of silver had been produced from placer and lode
deposits. The lode deposits in the Manhattan district are of a variety of types, although they occur
together in a coherent belt about 1 km wide, which follows the south side of the Manhattan caldera for
about 10 km. The most productive deposits formed in strongly faulted argillite and quartzite of the
Cambrian age Gold Hill Formation. The generally north-trending zones of mineralized fractures are
stockworks  containing  quartz,  adularia,  pyrite  (oxidized  to  limonite)  and  native  gold  similar  to  the
sheeted zones at Round Mountain. The silver production recorded for this camp is related to electrum
and various silver-bearing sulphosalts.
The  Clipper  Mine  located  approximately  5  miles  southwest  of  the  Longstreet  Mine  near  Murphy
Camp  was  discovered  in  1903  and  was  worked  intermittently  until  1943.  The  mine  was  initially
developed during World War I and included a 175 foot shaft and a 370 foot adit. Recorded production
is about $12,000 (in 1951dollars) from mineralization having a gold to silver ratio of 1:1 and assaying
from  $34-124  per  ton  (1951  dollars).  Host  rocks  are  welded  rhyolite  ash-flow  tuffs  similar  to  the
Longstreet mine.  The Little Joe Claim located 6 miles south-southwest of the Longstreet Mine was
developed by a 75 foot inclined shaft. Gold-bearing veins in ‘rhyolitic tuff’ were mined but production
details are lacking.
At an un-named mine, located 1.5 miles west of the mouth of Georges Canyon irregular gold / silver
quartz veins and veinlets containing minor pyrite were exploited from a 25 foot inclined shaft. The
vein  system  occurs  in  possible  Paleozoic  light  gray  chert  and  silicified  argillite  along  a  fault.  No
production details are available.
Mineralization on the Last Chance claims located 11 miles west-northwest of the Longstreet Mine
and southwest of Big Ten Peak was discovered in the 1920s. Mineralization consists of argentiferous
galena,  minor  sphalerite  and  pyrite  occurring  in  irregular  pipes  and  chimneys  generally  at  the
intersection of cross faults within a northwest-trending shear zone in pre-Tertiary rocks. This property
was developed by a 30 m two compartment shaft and a 61 m adit. Production in the late 1920s is
recorded as 13.6 tons containing an average of 720 g/t Ag, 21% Pb and 2% Zn. A further 18.1 tons
produced in 1938 contained 240-275 g/t Ag and 8% Pb.
Metallurgy:  2013 Metallurgical Test Program
The  2013  metallurgical  test  work  program  was  conducted  by  McLelland  Laboratories  under  the
direction of a QP metallurgical engineer contracted by Star Gold. The program included bottle roll
tests, column tests and comminution tests and mineralogical examination.
Section Sample Assays
A total of 65 underground adit samples weighing 816 pounds (370kg) and three surface samples
weighing 904 pounds (410kg) were collected for metallurgical testing. Each of these samples were
crushed to 100% -2 inches (50mm) and assayed for gold and silver in duplicate. Assay results are
listed in Table 8.2. Samples were combined to generate surface and underground composites, as
well as a blended master composite. Triplicate direct assays were conducted on each composite.
Standard  deviations  between  triplicate  head  assays  were  high,  particularly  for  the  surface  master
composite. The agreement between the triplicate splits was not good, however the average of the
triplicate assays is close to what was expected, based on the section assays. It was noted that the
Quality Control samples all checked out as well, which indicates that the assays are good and the
gold occurrence in the potentially economic mineralization is just a little “spotty”.

A total of twenty pieces of rock from both underground and surface were selected for comminution
testing. The remainder of the samples were separately stage crushed to 100% -2-inches (-50mm).
Each  of  the  underground  and  surface  samples  were  then  blended  to  form  a  master  composite
representing  both  the  underground  and  surface  samples.  The  blended  sample  was  then  split  to
generate a third master composite. Samples were collected for bottle roll tests. All composites were
then further crushed to 80% -3/4 inch (19mm), blended, then split into 75kg lots for column testing.
 Selection sample assay results and detailed blending procedures are provided in the Appendix to
this report.
Bottle Roll Testing
A bottle roll test was conducted on each of the three composites at an 80% -10 Mesh (1.7mm) feed
size to determine lime requirements for column leach testing. Gold and silver recoveries were similar
for all three composites. Gold recoveries ranged from 80.6% to 81.9% and silver recoveries ranged
from 17.5% to 20.0%.
Additional  bottle  roll  tests,  at  a  cyanide  concentration  of  1.0g  NaCN/L  were  conducted  on  the
blended master composite at feed sizes of 100% -2 inches (50mm), 80% -3/4 inches (19mm) and
80% -1/4 inch (6.3mm) to determine sensitivity to feed size. The blended master composite showed a
moderate sensitivity to feed size with respect to gold and silver recovery. Recovery was 18.4% higher
for gold, and 13.9% higher for silver, at a feed size of 80% -1/16 inches (1.7mm) than at a feed size of
100% -2 inches (50mm).
Silver recovery, for each bottle roll test conducted, was low. In order to investigate the cause of the
low silver recovery, three additional bottle roll tests were conducted on the blended master composite
to determine response to increased cyanide concentration (5.0g NaCN/L) at typical heap leach (80%
-3/4 inches, 80% -1/4 inches) and milled (80% -200 Mesh (75µm)) feed sizes.
Results  showed  that  increasing  the  cyanide  concentration  did  not  significantly  increase  silver
recovery at heap leach feed sizes, however, silver recovery increased substantially when feed was
finely  ground.  Silver  recovery  was  60.6%  from  the  bottle  roll  test  conducted  on  80%  -200  mesh
material. Gold recovery was also moderately higher when fine grinding was employed. Mineralogical
analysis of head and tail samples of the blended master composite confirm that the primary reason
for  low  silver  recovery  is  due  to  the  very  fine  grained  nature  of  the  silver  sulfide,  which  when
exposed, is readily leachable. The silver leach rate at 200 mesh was extremely fast. Silver recovery
was  complete  within  the  first  two  hours,  which  suggests  that  the  silver  mineralization  is  very  fast
leaching  once  liberated.  In  contrast,  silver-bearing  jarosites  tend  to  be  refractory  and  are  usually
unaffected by leaching regardless of the grind size.
Summary results from bottle roll testing are given in Table 8.3. Detailed bottle roll test data including
leach rate figures, are provided in the attached spreadsheet.
Page 20 of 58
Bottle Roll Test Results, 2013
Both  gold  and  silver  recoveries  are  slightly  improved  with  increased  crush  size,  the  increase  in
recovery is more pronounced in the silver as compared to gold when a fine grind is applied. Figure
8.3 illustrates this. It is important to keep in mind that in order to reduce the particle size to 80 %
passing 75 microns a conventional comminution circuit employing crushing and grinding would be
required.
Figure .  Crush Size Versus Metal Recovery
Column Leach Testing
Column leach test were conducted on each of the master composites, utilizing a feed size of 80% -
3/4  inch  (19  mm)  in  order  to  determine  gold  and  silver  recoveries,  recovery  rates  and  reagent
requirements under simulated heap leach conditions. Lime additions were based on bottle roll tests.
Test columns were sized at 15 cm diameter by 3 meters high using PVC piping with material stacked
in  the  leaching  columns  in  a  manner  in  which  to  minimize  particle  segregation  and  compaction.
Leaching was conducted by applying a cyanide solution of 1.0g NACN/L over the charge at a feed
rate of 12 Lph/m2 of column cross sectional area. After leaching, fresh water rinsing was conducted to
remove residual cyanide and to recover dissolved gold and silver values.
Detail column leach tests data, including screen analysis of the feed and tails and drain down rates
can  be  found  in  the  Appendix,  identified  as  McLelland  Report  No.  3829  entitled  Heap  Leach
Cyanidation Testing Longstreet Project, dated April 6, 2014.

All three composites were leached for 190 days. Gold and silver extractions for the surface master
composite  (SMC)  reached  88.9  %  and  20.0  %,  respectively.    Gold  and  silver  extraction  for  the
underground master composites (UMC) was 84.6 % for gold and 15.4 % for silver.  The master blend
composite (MBC) achieved gold and silver recoveries of 86.3 and 16.7 respectively. Summary results
from column leach testing are provided in Table 8.4. Detailed results, including leach rate figures are
provided in the Appendix.

Recovery results by size fraction for all three master composites indicates that finer crushing would
not  substantially  improve  gold  recovery.  Gold  recovery  was  similar  throughout  the  various  size
fractions with only a slightly elevated recovery in the finest size fraction (-75 microns). Silver recovery
on the other hand would benefit from a finer particle size and would require fine grinding in order to
maximize recovery.
Overall metallurgical results indicate that the Longstreet master composites are readily amenable to
simulated heap leach treatment at 80 % -19 mm feed size. Gold recoveries for all three composites
were similar and ranged from 84.6 % to 88.9 % in 190 days of leaching and rinsing. Silver recoveries
were similar for all three samples, with recoveries ranging from 15.4 % to 20.0%.
It is important to note that although the column tests were conducted over a period of 190 days, gold
extraction was essentially completed in the first 30 days of leaching. Silver leach rates, on the other
hand, were very slow and it is not expected that they would improve beyond the 190 day cycle.
Cyanide consumption rates were high and ranged from 1.56 to 1.93 kg NaCN/t of ore. This was due
in part to the long leach times. Cyanide consumption rates in a commercial operation are typically
much lower.
Figures 8.4, 8.5 and 8.6 diagramatically illustrate the leach rates and results for gold and silver.

Property Geology:    Geologic  mapping  by  MinQuest  since  2002  indicates  that  the  majority  of  the
Longstreet Project is underlain by moderately to poorly welded rhyolite ash-flow tuff (‘Tat’) containing
conspicuous exotic lithic fragments and pumice (Figures 5, 7, 8 and 9). The ash-flow tuff unit is buff to
gray, and contains <10% quartz phenocrysts, 15% feldspar phenocrysts, 5-15% pumice and 5-20%
other  exotic  fragments  in  an  aphanitic  groundmass  (Liedtke,  1984).  Hydrothermal  alteration  is
prevalent and consists of argillic (bleaching and clay mineral development), silicic (pervasive silica
flooding, or extremely high veinlet density) and potassic (adularia in quartz veinlets). Limonite and
geothite  development  is  considered  to  be  weathering  phenomena.  These  felsic  ash-flow  tuffs  of
Oligocene  age  are  similar  in  age  and  character  to  the  ‘tuffs  of  Round  Mountain’,  which  host  the
Round Mountain Mine.
The Tat tuff unit (see Figures 7, 8 and 9) displays horizontal bedding and may be in the order of
3,000  feet  thick.  The  ash-flow  tuff  is  intruded  by  rhyolite  porphyry  dykes  (‘Trp’)  exhibiting  various
orientations,  and  may  represent  feeder  conduits  to  now-eroded  rhyolitic  lithologies  higher  in  the
stratigraphy.
A thin discontinuous unit of volcaniclastic and siliceous sediments (‘Ts’), including sinter is deposited
upon the ash-flow tuff unit. The unit is white, yellowish and light gray, bedded in part and probably
represents a hiatus in volcanism. Siliceous alteration resulting in the development of sheeted quartz
vein systems affects the Tat, Ts and Trp rock units.
Overlying the Tat tuff and the Ts sediments is a black to brown strongly welded ash-flow tuff (‘Trt’)
that forms bluffs and caps ridges. This unit has a distinctive thin (about 10 feet) vitrophyre zone near
its base. This unit is estimated to be 300 to 450 feet thick and possibly a correlative of the Saulsbury
Wash Formation (21.6 +/- 0.6 Ma).
The tectonic fabric on the Longstreet Project includes two Main directions of faulting/fracturing that
have an influence on the mineralization. An east-trending steeply north-dipping system of fractures
and faults has been noted at five of the seven gold / silver zones on the Property (see Figure 6).
Quartz  –adularia  –  limonite  veins  /  veinlets  and  ‘rusty  fractures’  following  this  trend  contain  gold
mineralization. The other important gold / silver-bearing fault/fracture direction is 300-330° with steep
north dips, and is characterized by sheeted quartz veins / veinlets and ‘rusty fractures’. The vein /
veinlets also contain adularia and iron oxide minerals derived from the oxidation of sulfide minerals.
This mineralized trend occurs at all seven of the gold / silver zones known on the Longstreet Project.
Major displacement is not a feature of these structures.
The Longstreet project is an example of gold / silver mineralization related to east-trending structures.
An east-tending fault dipping 40-55° is associated with the highest-grade gold / silver mineralization
known  to  date.  The  bulk  of  the  gold  /  silver  mineralization  in  the  Longstreet  Mine  is  contained  in
steeply dipping multiple vein sets in the hanging wall of the fault.
Liedtke (1984) indicates that similar fault directions are known 4,600 feet south and 2,800 feet north
of the Longstreet Mine, which may host similar high-grade gold / silver mineralization.

Targets:  A short description of the 7 currently identified drilling targets at Longstreet follows:
anomalous gold values.
Spire: This is an E-W vertical to steeply north dipping sheeted vein system. Intersecting NW  trending
veins are present, but are much less abundant than at Main. .Surface sampling at Spire had detected
anomalous gold values.
Star's  geologists  believe  sampling  and  drilling  results  to  date  warrant  optimism  of  one  or  more
 economic, near surface, bulk-mineable, heap leach-recoverable  gold-silver deposits at Longstreet
targets  described  above.  In  addition,  sampling  at  surface  near  the  Cyprus  target  suggests  the
presence of higher grade veins, which may be suitable to underground mining methods.  Situated on
a high ridge-top, it could be easily mined from a canyon elevation adit.
Environmental,  plan  of  operation  and  reclamation:  To  the  Company’s  knowledge,  there  is  no
known  surface  disturbance  or  groundwater  contamination 
from  previous  mining  activities.
  Remediation  activities  are  performed  immediately  after  completion  of  exploratory  drilling.    With
respect to historical mining activities, there is no indication of reclamation at this time, therefore, the
Company has no plans to remediate.  The Longstreet property is within Forest Service lands and
Star  Gold  has  applied  for  and  received  a  Plan  of  Operation  from  the  Forest  Service  allowing
exploration drilling. A surface disturbance bond of $21,600 has been paid and is held by the Forest
Service until reclamation is completed.  There are no other significant environmental requirements.

Dividends
The Company has not declared any dividends on its common stock since inception. There are no
dividend restrictions that limit the Company's ability to pay dividends on common stock in its Articles
of Incorporation or Bylaws. The Corporation's governing statute, Chapter 78 – “Private Corporations”
of  the  Nevada  Revised  Statutes  (the  “NRS”),  does  provide  limitations  on  our  ability  to  declare
dividends. Section 78.288 of Chapter 78 of the NRS prohibits us from declaring dividends where,
after giving effect to the distribution of the dividend:
(a)
(b)
the Company would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of
business; or
 
the Company's total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that
would be needed, if we were to be dissolved at the time of distribution, to satisfy the preferential
rights upon dissolution of stockholders who may have preferential rights and whose preferential
rights are superior to those receiving the distribution (except as otherwise specifically allowed
by our Articles of Incorporation).

Securities Authorized for Issuance under Stock Option Plan
On May 25, 2011, the Board of Directors approved a Stock Option Plan.  The Stock Option Plan is
administered  by  the  Board  of  Directors  and  provides  for  the  grant  of  stock  options  to  eligible
individuals  including  directors,  executive  officers  and  advisors  that  that  have  furnished  bona  fide
services to the Company not related to the sale of securities in a capital-raising transaction.
The Stock Option Plan has a maximum percentage of 10% of the Company's outstanding shares that
are eligible for the plan pool whereby the number of shares under the Stock Option Plan increase
automatically with increases in the total number of outstanding common shares.  This "Evergreen"
provision permits the reloading of shares that make up the available pool for the Stock Option Plan,
once the options granted have been exercised.  The number of shares available for issuance under
the Stock Option Plan automatically increases as the total number of shares outstanding increase,
including those shares issued upon exercise of options granted under the Stock Option Plan, which
become re-available for grant subsequent to exercise of option grants.  The number of shares subject
to the Stock Option Plan and any outstanding awards under the Stock Option Plan will be adjusted
appropriately  by  the  Board  of  Directors  if  the  Company's  common  stock  is  affected  through  a
reorganization, merger, consolidation, recapitalization, restructuring, reclassification, dividend (other
than quarterly cash dividends) or other distribution, stock split, spin-off or sale of substantially all of
the Company's assets.
The Stock Option Plan also has terms and limitations including without limitation that the exercise
price for stock options granted under the Stock Option Plan must equal the stock's fair market value,
based on the closing price per share of common stock, at the time the stock option is granted.
On May 30, 2011, the Board of Directors approved a grant of 326,666 options (as adjusted for reverse
stock split of February 2, 2012) under the Stock Option Plan to Directors, Executive Officers and other
non-employee consultants.  The options have an exercise price of $0.90 which approximates the fair
market value of the Company's common equity on the date of the grant based on the closing price as
quoted by the National Quotation Bureau on the day of grant.  The option certificates will reflect the
actual date of the grant.  The Company will recognize stock option expense related to these grants in
subsequent periods.
On March 22, 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the grant of 236,667 options (as adjusted for
reverse  stock  split  of  February  2,  2012)  to  purchase  shares  of  the  Company  to  various  directors,
officers and consultants.  The options have an exercise price of $0.78 which approximates the fair
market value of the Company's common equity on the date of the grant based on the closing price as
quoted by the National Quotation Bureau on the day of grant.  The option certificates will reflect the
actual date of the grant.  The Company will recognize stock option expense related to these grants in
subsequent periods.
On  June  18,  2012  the  Board  of  Directors  authorized  the  grant  of  1,725,000  options  to  purchase
shares  of  common  stock  of  the  Company  to  various  directors,  officers  and  advisors.    The  options
have an exercise price of $0.30 which approximates the fair market value of the Company's common
equity  on  the  date  of  the  grant  based  on  the  closing  price  as  quoted  by  the  National  Quotation
Bureau  on  the  day  of  grant.    The  option  certificates  will  reflect  the  actual  date  of  the  grant.    The
Company will recognize stock option expense related to these grants in subsequent periods.
On May 22, 2013 the Board of Directors authorized the grant of 675,000 options to purchase shares
of common stock of the Company to various directors, officers and consultants.  The options have an
exercise price of $0.29 which approximates the fair market value of the Company's common equity
on the date of the grant based on the closing price as quoted by the National Quotation Bureau on
the day of grant.  The option certificates will reflect the actual date of the grant.  The Company will
recognize stock option expense related to these grants in subsequent periods.
On February 13, 2014, the Board of Directors authorized the grant of 350,000 options to purchase
shares of common stock of the Company to a director.  These options have an exercise price of $0.28
which approximates the fair market value of the Company's common equity on the date of the grant
based on the closing price as quoted by the National Quotation Bureau on the day of grant.  The
option certificates will reflect the actual date of the grant.  The Company will recognize stock option
expense related to this grant in subsequent periods.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION.
PLAN OF OPERATION
The  Company  maintains  a  corporate  office  in  Coeur  d'Alene,  Idaho.    This  is  the  primary
administrative office for the Company and is utilized by Board Chairman Lindsay Gorrill and Chief
Financial Officer Kelly Stopher.
The financial condition of the Company was positive during 2016 and the metals commodity markets
swung favorable late in 2015 with little impact as Star Gold is an exploration stage company.
In the past year the Company completed the following:
·
Star Gold Corp Board formally decided to proceed with the studies necessary to allow an EIS
document to be produced with the goal of obtaining a mine permit to be issued at Longstreet.
·
Met with representatives from USFS and BLM and other stakeholders as to an agreed pathway to
proceed through to an EIS document.
In 2016 the following studies were commenced:
1.
Fauna and Flora studies – late 2015 and completed June 2016.
2.
Water rights negotiations and requirements have commenced – late 2015.
3.
Cultural Resource Studies began in July 2016.
With the exception of hydrology related drilling, the Company does not intend to drill further at
Longstreet deposit until permitting has been completed.
Funds raised are intended to finish all necessary studies and should be sufficient to take Star Gold
into an EIS.

Management  believes  it  can  source  additional  capital  in  the  investment  markets  in  the  coming
months and years.  The Company may also consider other sources of funding, including potential
mergers, joint ventures and/or farm-out a portion of its exploration properties.
Future liquidity and capital requirements depend on many factors including timing, cost and progress
of the Company's exploration efforts.  The Company will consider additional public offerings, private
placement, mergers or debt instruments.
Additional financing will be required in the future to complete all necessary steps to apply for a final
permit. Although the Company believes it will be able to source additional financing there are no
guarantees any needed financing will be available at the time needed
Page 30 of 58
or  on  acceptable  terms,  if  at  all.    If  the  Company  is  unable  to  raise  additional  financing  when
necessary, it may have to delay exploration efforts or property acquisitions, or be forced to cease
operations.  Collaborative arrangements may require the Company to relinquish rights to certain of its
mining claims.

The Company has earned no operating revenue in 2016 or 2015 and does not anticipate earning any
revenues  in  the  near  future.  Star  Gold  Corp.  is  an  exploration  stage  company  and  presently  is
seeking other natural resources related business opportunities.
During the year ended April 30, 2015, management performed an analysis of its Jet and Excalibur
properties.    Internal  cash  flow  estimates  prepared  by  management  of  the  Company  did  not  prove
significant fair value exists in the properties.  Therefore, the Jet and Excalibur properties recognized
impairment  losses  in  fiscal  year  2015.    The  Company  subsequently  provided  formal  Notice  of
Cancellation of the Jet and Excalibur Property Option Agreements to the claims holder.  Under the
terms of the Property Option Agreements, the Company is obligated to pay claims fees to one year
following  termination.    The  Company  expects  those  claims  fees  to  be  less  than  $10,000  in  the
upcoming fiscal year ending April 30, 2016.
The Company will continue to focus its capital and resources toward exploration of the Longstreet
Property.
Total net loss for 2016 of $420,444 decreased by $752,430 from 2015 total net loss of $1,172,874.

studies.

General and administrative expense decreased $357,976 to $101,961 compared to 2015 expense of
$459,937.  The difference was primarily attributable to a decrease in management fees and payroll
by $183,277 and non-cash stock option expense of $102,791 in 2015.
On or about February 1, 2015, the Company and its President entered into a separation agreement
terminating all compensation provisions of the agreement.   On or about March 1, 2015 the Company
and its Chief Financial Officer also modified their compensation arrangement resulting in a lower
ongoing monthly rate. The Company also terminated employment agreements with an administrative
staff person. The Company granted no stock options to employees or directors during the year ended
April 30, 2016.  There remains no unrecognized stock option expense as of April 30, 2016.
  Consequently, management fees and payroll decreased $286,068 for the year ended April 30, 2016
compared to the same period ended April 30, 2015.  Management expects management fees and
payroll to remain relatively constant in the forthcoming fiscal year.
Travel expense decreased for the fiscal year ending April 30, 2016 by $37,816. Travel is generally
related to meetings associated with capital raises and visits to the exploration site by Company
management and financiers.
On or about June 30, 2015, the Company entered into a Lease Termination Agreement with a related
party (Note 10 of the Financial Statements).  The Company does not expect to incur any rent and
lease expense during the forthcoming fiscal year.

Audit and accounting fees increased $4,622 from $26,745 for the year end April 30, 2015 compared
to $31,367 for the year ended April 30, 2016.
Investor  relation  expense  of  $674  for  the  year  ended  April  30,  2016  was  a  decrease  of  $32,203
compared to $32,877 for the year ended April 30, 2015. During the year ended April 30, 2015, the
Company utilized an investor relations professional in Canada who provided tours of the Longstreet
property  to  prospective  capital  partners.  The  Company  limited  its  engagement  with  the  investors
relations professional and related tours during the year ended April 30, 2016.  Management expects
investor relation expense to remain relatively constant in 2017.
Public  company  expense  decreased  $58,054  for  the  year  ended  April  30,  2016  to  $511  from
$58,565.    The  decrease  is  virtually  entirely  related  to  certain  professional  fees  associated  with  a
contemplated listing of the Company’s common stock on a recognized

Working capital will be utilized for the Company’s ongoing exploration and environmental studies at
its Longstreet project scheduled for the summer of 2016 and general corporate purposes.
The  Company  utilized  $32,000  in  cash  from  Investing  Activities  to  exercise  its  option  on  claims
agreements  and  utilized  for  certain  capitalized  mineral  assets  at  its  Longstreet  project.    The
Company intends to continue exploration activities at Longstreet upon completion of environmental
studies and permitting.
As of April 30, 2016, the Company had cash on hand of $1,785. Since inception, the sole source of
financing  has  been  sales  of  the  Company's  debt  and  equity  securities.  Star  Gold  Corp.  has  not
attained profitable operations and its ability to pursue any future plan of operation is dependent upon
our ability to obtain financing.
Star Gold Corp. anticipates continuing to rely on sales of its debt and/or equity securities in order to
continue to fund ongoing operations. Issuances of additional shares of common stock may result in
dilution to the Company's existing stockholders. There is no assurance that the Company will be able
to complete any additional sales of equity securities or that it will be able arrange for other financing
to fund its planned business activities.   The Company is engaged in a private placement offering that
has raised a total of $137,500 as of July 29, 2016.
The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient
cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis, to obtain additional financing as may be required,
or ultimately to attain profitability.  Potential sources of cash, or relief of demand for cash, include
additional external debt, the sale of shares of the Company's stock or alternative methods such as
mergers or sale of the Company's assets.  No assurances can be given, however, that the Company
will  be  able  to  obtain  any  of  these  potential  sources  of  cash.    The  Company  currently  requires
additional  cash  funding  from  outside  sources  to  sustain  existing  operations  and  to  meet  current
obligations and ongoing capital requirements.
The  Company  plans  for  the  long  term  continuation  as  a  going  concern  include  financing  future
operations  through  sales  of  our  equity  and/or  debt  securities  and  the  anticipated  profitable
exploitation of the Company's mining properties.  These plans may also, at some future point, include
the  formation  of  mining  joint  ventures  with  senior  mining  company  partners  on  specific  mineral
properties  whereby  the  joint  venture  partner  would  provide  the  necessary  financing  in  return  for
equity in the property.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
The Company has no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to
have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or
expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to
its stockholders.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Company has identified certain accounting policies, described below, that are most important to
the portrayal of its current financial condition and results of operations. The Company's significant
accounting  policies  are  disclosed  in  the  notes  to  the  audited  financial  statements  included  in  this
Annual Report.
Asset Impairments
Significant  property  acquisition  payments  for  active  exploration  properties  are  capitalized.    The
evaluation  of  the  Company’s  mineral  properties  for  impairment  is  based  on  market  conditions  for
minerals, underlying mineralized material associated with the properties, and future costs that may
be required for ultimate realization through mining operations or by sale.  If no mineable ore body is
discovered,  or  market  conditions  for  minerals  deteriorate,  there  is  the  potential  for  a  material
adjustment to the value assigned to mineral properties.
Mineral Interests
Exploration costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. The Company capitalizes costs for
acquiring and leasing mineral properties and expenses costs to maintain mineral rights as incurred.
Should a property reach the production stage, these capitalized costs would be amortized using the
units-of-production method on the basis of periodic estimates of ore reserves. Mineral interests are
periodically assessed for impairment of value, and any subsequent losses are charged to operations
at  the  time  of  impairment.  If  a  property  is  abandoned  or  sold,  its  capitalized  costs  are  charged  to
operations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Star Gold Corp.
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Star Gold Corp. (“the Company”) as of April
30, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for
the  years  then  ended.  These  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Company’s
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits.
We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting
Oversight  Board  (United  States).  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audits  to
obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  financial  statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Star Gold Corp. as of April 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations
and  its  cash  flows  for  the  years  then  ended,  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally
accepted in the United States of America.
The  accompanying  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  assuming  that  the  Company  will
continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has
an  accumulated  deficit  and  negative  working  capital  at  April  30,  2016.    These  factors  raise
substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to
these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
APRIL 30, 2016
NOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS
Star Gold Corp. (the "Company") was initially incorporated as Elan Development, Inc., in the State of
Nevada on December 8, 2006. The Company was originally organized to explore mineral properties
in British Columbia, Canada but the Company is currently focusing on gold, silver and other base
metal-bearing properties in Nevada.
The Company's main business consists of assembling and/or acquiring land packages and mining
claims the Company believes have potential mining reserves, and expending capital to explore these
claims by drilling, geophysical work or other exploration work deemed necessary.  The business is a
high  risk  business  as  there  is  no  guarantee  that  the  Company's  exploration  work  will  ultimately
discover or produce any economically viable minerals.
NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
This summary of significant accounting policies is presented to assist in understanding the financial
statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management,
which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These financial statements and related notes
are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Going Concern
As  shown  in  the  accompanying  financial  statements,  the  Company  has  incurred  operating  losses
since inception.  As of April 30, 2016, the Company has limited financial resources with which to
achieve  the  objectives  and  obtain  profitability  and  positive  cash  flows.    As  shown  in  the
accompanying  balance  sheets  and  statements  of  operations,  the  Company  has  an  accumulated
deficit  of      $9,317,509,  and  at  April  30,  2016  the  Company's  working  capital  deficit  was  $70,571.
 Achievement of the Company's objectives will be dependent upon the ability to obtain additional
financing,  to  locate  profitable  mining  properties  and  generate  revenue  from  current  and  planned
business operations, and control costs.  The Company plans to fund its future operations by joint
venturing,  obtaining  additional  financing  from  investors,  and/or  lenders,  and  attaining  additional
commercial production.  However, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve
these objectives, therefore substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern exists.
 The financial statements do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability of recorded assets
nor the implications of associated bankruptcy costs should the Company be unable to continue as a
going concern. In the event the Company is unable to fulfill the annual exploration expenditures as
specified in the Property Option Agreements (Note 4), the Company will default on the agreement(s)
and surrender its right to future claims on the respective property.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of
revenues  and  expenses  during  the  reporting  period.  Significant  areas  requiring  the  use  of
management  assumptions  and  estimates  relate  to  asset  impairments  and  stock  option  valuation.
 Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions and could have a material effect on
the Company’s reported financial position and results of operations.
Cash and cash equivalents
For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments
with original maturities of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents.
Restricted cash
Restricted cash represents collateral for bonds held for exploration permits.
Financial Instruments
Page 41 of 58
STAR GOLD CORP.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
APRIL 30, 2016
The  Company's  financial  instruments  include  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  reclamation  bonds,  and
short term notes payable, related party.  All instruments are accounted for on a historical cost basis,
which, due to the short maturity of these financial instruments, approximates fair value at April 30,
2016 and 2015.
Fair Value Measures
The  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  Accounting  Standards  Codification  Topic  820  "Fair
Value Measurements" ("ASC 820") requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and
minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  ASC 820 establishes a fair
value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to
measure fair value.  A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based
upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  ASC 820 prioritizes
the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:
Level 1:  Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2:  Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that
are observable for the asset or liability such as quote prices for similar assets or liabilities in active
markets;  quoted  prices  for  identical  assets  in  markets  with  insufficient  volume  or  infrequent
transactions  (less  active  markets);  or  model-derived  valuations  in  which  significant  inputs  are
observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.
Level  3:    Level  3  applies  to  assets  or  liabilities  for  which  there  are  unobservable  inputs  to  the
valuation  methodology  that  are  significant  to  the  measurement  of  the  fair  value  of  the  assets  or
liabilities.
At April 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no assets or liabilities accounted for at fair value on a
recurring basis.
Mining Interests and Mineral Exploration Expenditures
Exploration costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. The Company capitalizes costs for
acquiring and leasing mining properties and expenses costs to maintain mineral rights as incurred.
Should a property reach the production stage, these capitalized costs would be amortized using the
units-of-production method on the basis of periodic estimates of ore reserves. Mining interests are
periodically assessed for impairment of value, and any subsequent losses are charged to operations
at  the  time  of  impairment.  If  a  property  is  abandoned  or  sold,  its  capitalized  costs  are  charged  to
operations.
Equipment
Equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation of equipment is calculated using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which ranges from three to seven years.  Maintenance
and  repairs  are  charged  to  operations  as  incurred.  Significant  improvements  are  capitalized  and
depreciated over the useful life of the assets. Gains or losses on disposition or retirement of property
and equipment are recognized in operating expenses.
Reclamation and Remediation
The Company's operations are subject to standards for mine reclamation that have been established
by  various  governmental  agencies.    In  the  period  in  which  the  Company  incurs  a  contractual
obligation for the retirement of tangible long-lived assets, the Company will record the fair value of an
asset  retirement  obligation  as  a  liability.    A  corresponding  asset  will  also  be  recorded  and
depreciated over the life of the asset.  After the initial measurement of an asset retirement obligation,
the liability will be adjusted at the end of each reporting period to reflect changes in the estimated
future cash flows underlying the obligation.  To date, the Company has not incurred any contractual
obligation requiring recording either a liability or associated asset.
Impaired Asset Policy
The  Company  periodically  reviews  its  long-lived  assets  to  determine  if  any  events  or  changes  in
circumstances  have  transpired  which  indicate  that  the  carrying  value  of  its  assets  may  not  be
recoverable, pursuant to guidance established in ASC Topic 360, "Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal  of  Long-lived  Assets".  The  Company  determines 
the
undiscounted net
impairment  by  comparing
Page 42 of 58
STAR GOLD CORP.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
APRIL 30, 2016
future  cash  flows  estimated  to  be  generated  by  its  assets  to  their  respective  carrying  amounts.  If
impairment is deemed to exist, the assets will be written down to fair value.
Stock-based Compensation
The Company estimates the fair value of options to purchase common stock using the Black-Scholes
model,  which  requires  the  input  of  some  subjective  assumptions.  These  assumptions  include
estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them
(“expected  life”),  the  estimated  volatility  of  the  Company’s  common  stock  price  over  the  expected
term (“volatility”), employee forfeiture rate, the risk-free interest rate and the dividend yield. Changes
in  the  subjective  assumptions  can  materially  affect  the  estimate  of  fair  value  of  stock-based
compensation.  Options  granted  have  a  ten-year  maximum  term  and  varying  vesting  periods  as
determined by the Board of Directors.  The value of shares of common stock awards is determined
based on the closing price of the Company’s stock on the date of the award.
Loss Per Share
Basic  Earnings  Per  Share  ("EPS")  is  computed  as  net  income  (loss)  available  to  common
stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
Diluted  EPS  reflects  the  potential  dilution  that  could  occur  from  common  shares  issuable  through
stock options and warrants.
The dilutive effect of outstanding securities for years ended April 30, 2016 and 2015, would be as
follows:
Stock options
Warrants
  TOTAL POSSIBLE DILUTION
April 30, 2016
3,083,667  
5,855,400  
8,939,067
April 30, 2015
3,058,667
1,614,400
4,673,067
At  April  30,  2016  and  2015,  respectively,  the  effect  of  the  Company's  outstanding  options  and
common stock equivalents would have been anti-dilutive.
Income Taxes
The Company recognizes provision for income tax using the liability method.  Deferred income tax
liabilities or assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rates expected to be in
effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered. A valuation allowance is recognized on deferred
tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all of these deferred tax assets will not be
realized.
New Accounting Pronouncement
In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15—Presentation of Financial Statements—Going
Concern. The guidance requires an entity’s management to evaluate whether there are conditions or
events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue
as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within
one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). If
conditions or events exist that raise substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going
concern, the guidance requires disclosure in the financial statements. The guidance will be effective
for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods
thereafter.  Early application is permitted.  The Company has concluded that adoption of the standard
would  have  minimal  impact  on  the  Company’s  financial  statements  as  such  disclosure  is  already
included the financial statements.

The  Company  leases  with  an  option  to  acquire  unpatented  mining  claims  located  in  the  State  of
Nevada  and  known  as  the  Longstreet  Property.    On  December  10,  2014,  the  Longstreet  Property
Option  Agreement  was  amended  revising  the  required  expenditures  and  annual  stock  option
obligation.  The Company is also obligated to pay an annual owners advance royalty payment of
$12,000 related to the Clifford claims which comprise a portion of the Longstreet Property but are not
covered by the Longstreet Property Option Agreement.
Under terms of the agreement, for the year ended April 30, 2015, the Company paid $56,000 and
issued options to purchase 25,000 shares of common stock with fair value of $3,000 (Note 6).  The
Company also purchased $9,000 of additional mining interest related to the Clifford claims on the
Longstreet property during the year ended April 30, 2015.
On January 5, 2016, the Longstreet Property Option Agreement was further amended revising the
required expenditures and annual stock option obligation.  All allowable expenditures in excess of
the required annual expenditures shall be carried-over to the subsequent year.
For the year ended April 30, 2016, the Company made an annual required payment to the optioner of
$20,000  which  is  included  in  “Equipment  and  Mining  Interest”.  The  Company  issued  options  to
purchase 25,000 shares of common stock with fair value of $1,500 (Note 6).  The Company also
purchased $12,000 advance royalty for additional mining interest on the Longstreet property related
to the Clifford claims.

Excalibur and Jet Properties
On  June  30,  2015,  the  Company  elected  to  terminate  the  Property  Option  Agreements  on  the
Excalibur  and  Jet  properties.    The  Company  recognized  an  impairment  expense  relating  to  the
Excalibur and Jet properties at April 30, 2015 and subsequently gave notice of cancellation on the
properties.   The Company expects to focus capital resources on advancing the Longstreet property
and therefore decided to return the Jet and Excalibur properties to the underlying owner before any
further exploration expenditures were due.  Under the terms of the original agreements, the Company
was responsible for claims payments on the  Excalibur  and  Jet  properties  one  year  in  advance  of
which the Company has charged operations $8,945 for the year ended April 30, 2016.  There are no
liabilities or future obligations to the Company on either the Jet or Excalibur properties.
NOTE 5 - INCOME TAXES
There  was  no  income  tax  provision  for  the  years  ended  April  30,  2016  and  2015  due  to  the

Deferred  income  taxes  arise  from  timing  differences  resulting  from  income  and  expense  items
reported for financial accounting and tax purposes in different periods. A deferred tax asset valuation
allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. As
management of the Company cannot determine that it is more likely than not that the Company will
realize the benefit of the net deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance equal to 100% of the deferred
tax assets has been recorded at April 30, 2016 and 2015.

STAR GOLD CORP.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
APRIL 30, 2016
The Company has no tax position at April 30, 2016 and 2015 for which the ultimate deductibility is
highly  certain  but  for  which  there  is  uncertainty  about  the  timing  of  such  deductibility.  It  is  not
anticipated that unrecognized tax benefits would significantly increase or decrease within 12 months
of  the  reporting  date.      The  Company  recognizes  interest  accrued  related  to  unrecognized  tax
benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses. No such interest or penalties were
recognized during the periods presented. The Company had no accruals for interest and penalties at
April 30, 2016 and 2015.  The Company’s federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2013 through
2016 remain open and subject to examination.
NOTE 6– RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
On September 1, 2011, the Company moved its offices to Coeur d’Alene, Idaho and leased office
space for $2,500 per month plus a proportionate share of utilities and insurance from Marlin Property
Management, LLC (“Marlin”) an entity owned by the spouse of the Company’s then President and
current Chairman of the Board. For the years ended April 30, 2016 and 2015, $2,855 and $34,293,
respectively,  was  paid  to  this  related  entity  inclusive  of  the  Company’s  pro-rata  share  of  common
expenses.  On or about June 30, 2015, the Company entered into a Lease Termination Agreement
with Marlin.  The Termination Agreement was effective as of June 1, 2015 and relieved the Company
of all obligations under the terms of the lease after that date.
On March 16, April 10 and April 14, 2015, the Company entered into short term promissory notes with
the Company’s Chairman of the Board of Directors in the aggregate amount of $101,916.  The notes

Options issued under the 2011 Stock Option/Restricted Plan
The Company established the 2011 Stock Option/Restricted Stock Plan.  The Stock Option Plan is
administered  by  the  Board  of  Directors  and  provides  for  the  grant  of  stock  options  to  eligible
individual including directors, executive officers and advisors that have furnished bona fide services
to the Company not related to the sale of securities in a capital-raising transaction.
The  Stock  Option  Plan  has  a  fixed  maximum  percentage  of  10%  of  the  Company's  outstanding
shares that are eligible for the plan pool, whereby the number of Shares under the plan increases
automatically increases as the total number of shares outstanding increase.  The number of shares
subject to the Stock Option Plan and any outstanding awards will be adjusted appropriately by the
Board  of  Directors  if  the  Company's  common  stock  is  affected  through  a  reorganization,  merger,
consolidation,  recapitalization,  restructuring,  reclassification  dividend  (other  than  quarterly  cash
dividends)  or  other  distribution,  stock  split,  spin-off  or  sale  of  substantially  all  of  the  Company's
assets.
The Stock Option plan also has terms and conditions, including without limitations that the exercise
price for stock options granted under the Stock Option Plan must equal the stock's fair market value,
based on the closing price per share of common stock, at the time the stock option is granted.  The
fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant utilizing the Black-Scholes model
and  commonly  utilized  assumptions  associated  with  the  Black-Scholes  methodology.    Options
granted under the Plan have a ten-year maximum term and varying vesting periods as determined by
the Board.

ITEM 9.  CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
For the years ended April 30, 2016 and 2015 there were no disagreements with our auditors on any
matter  of  accounting  principles  or  practices,  financial  statement  disclosure  or  auditing  scope  or
procedure.  For the years ended April 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no “reportable events” as that
term is described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The  Company’s  management  is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  adequate  internal
control over financial reporting.  The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed under the supervision of its President and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable
assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  the  Company’s
financial  statements  for  external  reporting  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally
accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America.*    Management  evaluates  the  effectiveness  of  the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  (COSO)  in  Internal  Control  –  “Integrated
Framework.”
Management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s President and Chief
Financial  Officer,  assessed  the  effectiveness  of  the  Company’s  internal  control  over  financial
reporting as of April 30, 2016 and concluded that it is ineffective in assuring that the financial reports
of the Company are free from material errors or misstatements.
*This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public
accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not
subject to attestation by its registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and
Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management’s report in this annual
report.
Management has identified two material weaknesses and is taking action to remedy and remove the
weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting:
·
Inappropriate Segregation of Duties, as the same Officer and Director was responsible for initiating
and recording transactions, thereby creating segregation of duties weakness.
Management’s Remediation Initiatives.
Because  of  the  inherent  limitations  in  all  control  systems,  no  evaluation  of  controls  can  provide
absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.  These inherent limitations
include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur
because of simple error or mistake.  The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will
succeed  in  achieving  its  stated  goals  under  all  potential  future  conditions.    Projections  of  any
evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks.
The Company clearly recognizes, and continues to recognize, the importance of implementing and
maintaining disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting and is
working to implement an effective system of controls.   Management is currently evaluating avenues
for mitigating the Company's internal controls weaknesses, but mitigating controls that are practical
and  cost  effective  may  not  be  found  based  on  the  size,  structure,  and  future  existence  of  the
organization,  Since  the  Company  has  not  generated  any  significant  revenues,  the  Company  is
limited  in  its  options  for  remediation  efforts.  Management,  within  the  confines  of  its  budgetary
resources, will engage its outside accounting firm to assist with an assessment of the Company’s
internal controls over financial reporting as of April 30, 2016.

Notes:
Based on 40,836,726 shares of the Company's common stock issued and outstanding as of
July 31, 2016, Under Rule 13d-3, certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by
more  than  one  person  (if,  for  example,  persons  share  the  power  to  vote  or  the  power  to
dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if
the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within
60  days  of  the  date  as  of  which  the  information  is  provided.  In  computing  the  percentage
ownership of any person, the number of shares outstanding is deemed to include the number
of  shares  beneficially  owned  by  such  person  (and  only  such  person)  by  reason  of  these
acquisition rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown
in this table does not necessarily reflect the person’s actual ownership or voting power with
respect to the number of shares of common stock actually outstanding on April 30, 2016.

ITEM  13.  CERTAIN  RELATIONSHIPS  AND  RELATED  TRANSACTIONS,  AND  DIRECTOR
INDEPENDENCE.
Except as described elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K, none of the following parties has, since
the Company's date of incorporation, had any material interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction
with us or in any presently proposed transaction that has or will materially affect us:
Any of the Company's directors or officers;

the voting rights attached to the Company's outstanding shares of common stock;

person.
Director Independence
Quotations for the Company's common stock are entered via the OTC Markets inter-dealer quotation
system,  which  does  not  have  director  independence  requirements.  For  purposes  of  determining
director independence, we have applied the definitions set out in NASDAQ Rule 4200(a)(15). Under
NASDAQ Rule 4200(a)(15), a director is not considered to be independent if he or she is also an
executive officer or employee of the corporation.
