<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 17/4, the Human Rights Council unanimously endorsed the Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations &#8220;Protect, 
</p>
<p>Respect and Remedy&#8221; Framework. This landmark decision by the Council marked the first 
time an intergovernmental body of the United Nations had endorsed a normative document 
on the previously very divisive issue of business and human rights. The endorsement by the 
Council effectively established the Guiding Principles as the authoritative global standard 
for preventing and addressing adverse impacts on human rights arising from business-
related activity.  
</p>
<p>2. In resolution 17/4, the Human Rights Council decided to establish a working group 
on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises 
with a mandate to, inter alia:  
</p>
<p>&#61623; Promote the effective and comprehensive dissemination and implementation 
of the Guiding Principles 
</p>
<p>&#61623; Identify, exchange and promote good practices and lessons learned on the 
implementation of the Guiding Principles and to assess and to make 
recommendations thereon and, in that context, to seek and receive 
information from all relevant sources 
</p>
<p>&#61623; Support capacity-building and, upon request, provide advice and 
recommendations regarding the development of domestic legislation and 
policies relating to human rights and business  
</p>
<p>&#61623; Explore options and make recommendations for enhancing access to effective 
remedies available to those whose human rights are affected by corporate 
activities, including those in conflict areas 
</p>
<p>&#61623; Integrate a gender perspective throughout the work of the mandate and give 
special attention to persons living in vulnerable situations, in particular 
children 
</p>
<p>&#61623; Guide the work of the Forum on Business and Human Rights, open to 
relevant stakeholders, to discuss trends and challenges in implementing the 
Guiding Principles and promote dialogue and cooperation on issues linked to 
business and human rights 
</p>
<p>3. At its eighteenth session, the Human Rights Council appointed five independent 
experts, of balanced geographical representation, for a period of three years, as members of 
the Working Group: Michael Addo, Alexandra Gu&#225;queta, Margaret Jungk, Puvan 
Selvanathan and Pavel Sulyandziga. 
</p>
<p>4. Directly after taking up its functions in November 2011, the Working Group made a 
public call to States and other stakeholders for input to help inform its planning, methods of 
work and focus areas. More than 75 submissions were received before the first session of 
the Working Group, held from 16 to 20 January 2012. During the first session, the Working 
Group also engaged in introductory exchanges with more than 140 stakeholders from 103 
organizations and with delegations representing some 58 States Members of the United 
Nations. The Working Group is deeply grateful to all who have contributed to and 
participated in its work to date.  
</p>
<p>5. The present report was drafted over a short period following the January session. It 
contains the Working Group&#8217;s preliminary considerations concerning the background and </p>


<p>context of the mandate, as well as some strategic considerations that will inform its work 
for the remainder of its mandate. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Background 
</b></p>
<p>6. In 2005, following a request by the Commission on Human Rights,1 the Secretary-
General appointed Professor John Ruggie as his Special Representative on the issue of 
human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, with a mandate 
to identify and clarify standards of responsibility and accountability for business enterprises 
with regard to human rights, and to elaborate on the role of States in this regard. 
</p>
<p>7. In 2008, drawing on the research and consultations conducted over the course of the 
first three years of his mandate, the Special Representative introduced the &#8220;Protect, 
Respect, Remedy&#8221; Framework to the Human Rights Council at its eighth session, as a 
foundation on which thinking and action could be developed.2 
</p>
<p>8. The Framework rests on the differentiated but complementary duties and 
responsibilities of States and companies on the issue of business and human rights. States 
have the primary duty to protect against human rights abuses by third parties, including 
business; businesses have the responsibility to respect human rights; and there is a need for 
greater access by victims to effective remedies, both judicial and non-judicial.  
</p>
<p>9. In its resolution 8/7, the Human Rights Council welcomed the Framework and 
requested the Special Representative to operationalize it. The resulting Guiding Principles 
provide concrete and practical recommendations for implementation of the Framework. The 
normative contribution of the Guiding Principles lies not in the creation of new 
international law obligations, but in elaborating the implications of existing standards and 
practices for States and businesses; integrating them within a single, logically coherent and 
comprehensive template; and identifying where the current framework falls short and how 
it should be improved.3 They highlight the steps that States need to take in order to ensure 
business respect for human rights and to provide effective remedy to those whose rights 
have been adversely; they provide a blueprint for companies to know and show that they 
respect human rights; and they constitute a benchmark that stakeholders can use to better 
assess, engage in and promote business respect and accountability for human rights. 
</p>
<p>10. The Guiding Principles are already widely supported as the authoritative global 
standard on business and human rights by States, business4 and civil society.5 From this 
advantageous starting point, the next step is to ensure the effective and broad-scale 
implementation of the Guiding Principles by States and companies. This unassailable goal 
is the focus of the mandate of the Working Group.

<p><b> III. Global context 
</b></p>
<p>11. The mandate of the Working Group is derived from and embedded in the constantly 
evolving debate on the global economic and human rights environment and the appropriate 
role of business in it. Without presuming to prioritize a single issue or represent a complete 
or rigorously analysed picture of the global context, the section below outlines some initial 
observations concerning broad current trends that have informed the considerations and 
deliberations of the Working Group to date. 
</p>
<p>12. Such global trends and issues as the expanding reach of international businesses, the 
growing demand for scarce natural resources and the ongoing global crises have focused 
unprecedented attention on the impact of businesses on the societies in which they operate. 
</p>
<p>13. The &#8220;governance gaps&#8221; created by globalization have become even more relevant in 
today&#8217;s environment of financial, economic, environmental and social crises. As the effects 
</p>
<p>of these interacting global challenges continue to unfold, thousands of people around the 
world have taken to the streets to protest against sectors perceived to have contributed to 
these crises; the perceived failure of States to take adequate steps to protect the rights of 
vulnerable persons and ensure accountability, and the perceived excesses of globalization 
that have contributed to harmful business-related effects on the environment, equality, 
justice and human rights. 
</p>
<p>14. Continuing financial distress and economic downturn remain a major concern for 
policymakers aiming to improve global economic governance, fill regulatory gaps and 
design interventions to keep ailing economies afloat. In 2012, global economic recovery is 
expected to stall,6 and the International Labour Organization estimates that, with the recent 
slowdown in economic activity, only half the number of jobs required to recover pre-crisis 
employment rates will be created.7  
</p>
<p>15. While some segments of society have benefitted from current economic patterns and 
globalization, others undeniably have not. This poses a challenge for sustainable and 
inclusive economic development, and raises concerns that some individuals and 
communities are becoming increasingly marginalized and vulnerable to business-related 
impact on their human rights.  
</p>
<p>16. In the face of the interlocking and myriad challenges currently affecting the global 
economy, businesses, in conjunction with States, have an indispensable role to play, in 
shaping a common path towards a sustainable future. Businesses have a critical contribution 
to make to inclusive economic growth, job creation and the quest for new durable and 
innovative ways to realize all three pillars of sustainable development: economic, 
environmental and social.  
</p>
<p>17. In this context, scrutiny of how business enterprises are meeting their responsibility 
to respect human rights, and how States are protecting rights holders from business-related 
harm, is increasing.8 Civil society and other stakeholders are casting an ever wider and 
intense spotlight on instances of alleged company involvement in human rights 
infringements, adding weight to the push for greater accountability.

<p>18. Recent media coverage of the impact on human rights linked to global brands and 
the increasing attention paid by investors to environmental, social and governance risks 
further indicate that societies expect companies to respect human rights throughout their 
operations and business relationships.9  
</p>
<p>19. As companies domiciled in emerging economies play an ever greater role in the 
global marketplace &#8211; as seen for example in the increasing global reach of corporations 
headquartered in the &#8220;BRIC&#8221; countries (Brazil, the Russian Federation, India and China) &#8211; 
business and human rights concerns are increasingly raised not only in relation to 
&#8220;Western&#8221; companies, but also with regard to a much wider suite of companies in all 
regions and sectors of the economy.  
</p>
<p>20. Governance gaps lie at the core of the human rights and business challenge. This 
remains the case for all States and regions and for companies of all sizes, sectors and 
operational contexts. The Working Group is aware of a broad range of such gaps, concerns 
and challenges, including in such areas as governance, corruption, conflict zones and 
persons living in vulnerable situations, including children, indigenous peoples, migrant 
workers, minorities and persons with disabilities. A gender perspective adds further 
dimensions to these concerns.  
</p>
<p>21. Nonetheless, attempts to close the governance gaps with respect to business and 
human rights are gaining ground. The Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights 
play a key role in many of these initiatives.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Uptake 
</b></p>
<p>22. Less than a year after their unanimous endorsement by Human Rights Council, the 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights have already been incorporated into a 
number of leading international standards and initiatives and have been used as the basis of 
important implementation and dissemination efforts by regional intergovernmental 
organizations, States, national human rights institutions, business organizations and 
enterprises, and civil society. 
</p>
<p>23. The initiatives surveyed represent the first positive steps on the journey to 
comprehensive dissemination and implementation of the Guiding Principles. The Working 
Group will work to identify and promote ways to build on the strength of these good efforts 
wherever possible and appropriate, towards the common goal of comprehensive and 
effective implementation. The Working Group has not yet had the opportunity to undertake 
a systematic mapping of the status of implementation and dissemination of the Guiding 
Principles; the current section therefore presents an overview based on information received 
to date by the Working Group. The examples covered are not exhaustive, and are intended 
to serve as an indication of the growing diversity of initiatives being undertaken. The 
Working Group welcomes additional information from all relevant sources regarding 
activities involving the dissemination or implementation of the Guiding Principles, 
including, in particular, information concerning good practices and lessons learned in this 
regard.

<p><b> A. International standards and initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>24. In 2010, the International Organization for Standardization released its social 
responsibility standard, ISO 26000, which includes a human rights chapter aligned with the 
corporate responsibility to respect human rights, as articulated in the Guiding Principles.10  
</p>
<p>25. The Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises of the Organization for Economic 
Development and Cooperation (OECD), as updated in 2011, now align fully with the 
corporate responsibility to respect human rights as set out in the Guiding Principles.11 
Recent statements by some National Contact Points, who are mandated to handle 
complaints on alleged breaches of the Guidelines, illustrate and reinforce the link between 
the OECD Guidelines and the Guiding Principles.12 
</p>
<p>26. The United Nations Global Compact has stated that the Guiding Principles provide 
the content of the first principle of the Global Compact, and thus form part of the 
commitment made by some 8,700 corporate participants in the Global Compact.13  
</p>
<p>27. The updated International Finance Corporation Sustainability Framework, which 
came into effect on 1 January 2012, now reflects important aspects of the corporate 
responsibility to respect human rights, as set out in the Guiding Principles.14 
</p>
<p>28. Important aspects of the corporate responsibility to respect human rights have also 
been incorporated into the final draft of voluntary guidelines on the responsible governance 
of tenure of land, fisheries and forests in the context of national food security, which is 
pending final approval by the Committee on World Food Security at its special session in 
May 2012.15 
</p>
<p><b> B. Initiatives by regional intergovernmental organizations 
</b></p>
<p>29. The European Commission has issued a communication on corporate social 
responsibility, in which it expressed its expectation that all enterprises should meet human 
rights responsibility as defined in the Guiding Principles.16 In the wake of the 
communication, the Commission initiated projects to develop globally-applicable guidance 
based on the Guiding Principles for three industrial sectors (oil and gas, information and 
communications technology, and employment and recruitment) and for small and medium-

<p>sized enterprises.17 It has also stated its intention to publish periodic progress reports on the 
implementation of the Guiding Principles within the European Union, and invited its 
Member States to develop national plans for the implementation of the Guiding Principles 
by the end of 2012.18 
</p>
<p>30. In late 2011, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) announced that 
the first thematic study by its new intergovernmental commission on human rights would 
focus on business and human rights and target an ASEAN guideline that would be fully 
compliant with the United Nations frameworks, in particular the Guiding Principles.19 
</p>
<p><b> C. Initiatives by national Governments 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Working Group received information from some Governments on initiatives to 
implement the Guiding Principles at the national level. For example, in June 2011, the 
Netherlands passed a motion in Parliament requesting the Government to provide a plan on 
how it intended to implement the Guiding Principles; in November 2011, Colombia and the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland issued a joint declaration expressing 
their commitment to implement the Guiding Principles;20 and during the first half of 2012, 
the United Kingdom is holding multi-stakeholder consultations with business, civil society 
and academics on the process of preparing guidance to business enterprises on the 
application of the Guiding Principles.21 
</p>
<p><b> D. Initiatives by national human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p>32. National human rights institutions made important contributions to the process of 
developing the Framework and Guiding Principles, as well as promoting the convergence 
between these and other international standards. Both the Guiding Principles and Human 
Rights Council resolution 17/4, in which the Council endorsed the Principles, envisage a 
key role for national human rights institutions in the context of their implementation. The 
Working Group on Business and Human Rights of the International Coordinating 
Committee of National Institutions has developed a draft plan of action that focuses on four 
activity areas: (a) to provide guidance and tools to national institutions on business and 
human rights; (b) to engage with stakeholders on human rights and the role of national 
institutions in implementing international and regional initiatives on business and human 
rights; (c) to produce and deliver awareness and outreach activities and products; and (d) to 
develop, pilot, implement and evaluate regional training and tools in collaboration with 
regional networks. National human rights institutions have also recently held regional 
strategic planning workshops on business and human rights, and identified priorities for

<p>regional groupings of national institutions, including on their role in the context of 
implementing the Guiding Principles.22 
</p>
<p><b> E. Uptake by business organizations and enterprises 
</b></p>
<p>33. Several business associations and networks have announced initiatives to develop 
guidance on the implementation of the Guiding Principles.  
</p>
<p>34. The International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association, a 
global oil and gas industry association for environmental and social issues, launched a 
three-year project in June 2011 for collaborative learning on due diligence and grievance 
mechanisms leveraging on the collective experience of its members and external expertise. 
The initiative is aimed at building the capacity of Association members and contributing to 
the implementation of the Guiding Principles.23  
</p>
<p>35. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil has commenced a study on human rights 
standards, including the Guiding Principles, to inform a review of the principles and criteria 
standard by which its members operate globally.24  
</p>
<p>36. The Global Business Initiative on Human Rights explores good practices and 
challenges in implementing the corporate responsibility to respect human rights, and seeks 
to build awareness and capacity among businesses in diverse markets. It specifically 
addresses the challenges involved in integrating human rights considerations into business 
relationships, human rights policy and human rights due diligence.25  
</p>
<p>37. Some local networks of the United Nations Global Compact have specific work 
streams on business and human rights at the national level, with an explicit focus on the 
Guiding Principles.  
</p>
<p>38. The implementation of the Guiding Principles is also on the agenda of institutional 
investors26 and bar associations.27 In addition, a number of individual business enterprises 
have taken steps to or are in the process of designing policies and internal guidance that 
take the Guiding Principles into account.28  
</p>
<p><b> F. Application by civil society 
</b></p>
<p>39. Civil society organizations are actively working to promote enhanced accountability 
of States and business enterprises for the human rights impact of business activity, with 
numerous examples referencing the &#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; Framework and

<p>Guiding Principles.29 For example, civil society organizations have used the Framework 
and the Guiding Principles in relation to the recent review processes of key international 
standards, including the OECD Guidelines and the Sustainability Framework of the 
International Finance Corporation. They have also been cited by civil society when 
commenting on domestic legislation proposals. Moreover, it was brought to the attention of 
the Working Group that there is an increasing number of examples of analyses and 
advocacy in relation to business activities in specific contexts and industries that are being 
informed by the Guiding Principles.30 In the context of the United Nations human rights 
system, some organizations have also referenced the Guiding Principles and the Framework 
in submissions for the universal periodic review process, to assess implementation of the 
State&#8217;s duty to protect human rights.31 
</p>
<p><b> G. Initial considerations 
</b></p>
<p>40. The developments described above that have been brought to the attention of the 
Working Group prompt two initial reflections, which will be further addressed in the 
section on strategic considerations below. First, while these initiatives enhance 
opportunities for the Working Group to be more effective and comprehensive in 
disseminating and implementing the Guiding Principles, a majority of State, business and 
civil society actors are unaware of the Guiding Principles, precluding even the possibility of 
implementation. Second, despite converging standards and initiatives, such as those above, 
there remains a significant risk of fragmentation in the interpretation and implementation of 
the Guiding Principles. Beyond awareness and commitment, actors and stakeholders in all 
regions require support to build capacity to effectively implement the Guiding Principles 
within their policies and operations. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Feedback from consultations with stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>41. The proposals and recommendations provided to the Working Group in written 
submissions prior to and at the introductory exchange of the first session reflect the vast 
scope and complexity of the mandate of the Working Group mandate, and more generally 
of the business and human rights agenda. The key trends noted in the observations made by 
stakeholders are summarized below. It should be noted that the summary does not pretend 
to be exhaustive or to fully reflect the richness of perspectives put forward to the Working 
Group.  
</p>
<p>42. Inputs from States emphasized that the Working Group should be active in all 
regions and maintain a close dialogue with States. Feedback focused on the provisions in 
the mandate of the Working Group on disseminating and implementing the Guiding 
Principles at the national level, particularly capacity-building and the sharing of knowledge, 
and lessons learned and good practices, including at sectoral level. In terms of working 
methods, States recommended that the Working Group should develop a close relationship

<p>with other special procedures mandate holders and conduct regular exchange with United 
Nations agencies and programmes and international institutions.  
</p>
<p>43. Some States suggested that international legal options in the field of business and 
human rights should be explored. Issues raised by States included human rights due 
diligence, engagement with small and medium-sized enterprises, business operations in 
conflict zones, and vulnerable groups such as indigenous peoples, women and children. 
Some States also proposed that the Working Group facilitate a common inventory or portal 
to compile the efforts made by States and business to implement the Guiding Principles. 
With regard to its role in the broader field of business and human rights, States suggested 
that the Working Group should be an authoritative focal point and facilitator for the 
development of practical guidance and the promotion of alignment and coordination 
between ongoing implementation efforts. 
</p>
<p>44. Submissions from civil society urged the Working Group to be informed by actual 
situations of alleged business-related human rights abuse, in addition to examples of good 
practices. Some organizations also stressed the need to give special priority to engaging 
with individuals and communities adversely affected by business activities, as well as 
human rights defenders. While civil society recommended a wide range of issues to be 
given priority by the Working Group, three key issues emerged: (a) recommendations for 
exploring the further development of international standards; (b) access to remedies, and in 
particular obstacles in access to justice for victims of human rights abuse involving 
business; and (c) the impact of business on indigenous peoples and other vulnerable groups, 
including women and children. Other key suggestions included exploring the applicability 
of the Guiding Principles to financial institutions, both public and private, and for the 
Working Group to focus on large-scale investment projects in various sectors. 
</p>
<p>45. Business enterprises and organizations recommended that the Working Group 
should engage directly with business in all regions and all industries in an open and 
inclusive manner, and that its thematic focus should be balanced in terms of focus on all 
three pillars of the &#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; Framework. Business submissions also 
flagged the need for companies to be given appropriate time and space to apply the Guiding 
Principles in ways that take into account different individual circumstances. One key 
concern raised by business was the issue of how governance challenges, such as high levels 
of corruption and the importance of the informal sector, have an impact on the business 
responsibility to respect human rights. 
</p>
<p>46. While the present summary does not necessarily reflect the thematic priorities of the 
Working Group, the Working Group is mindful of all the perspectives referred to above, as 
well as others presented in the consultations. They provide vital input to its activities, and 
reflect the knowledge and experiences of stakeholders that have already begun to 
implement the Guiding Principles. The Working Group will continue to engage with all the 
groups consulted to date, and welcomes further submissions. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Strategy 
</b></p>
<p>47. At its first session, the Working Group analysed its mandate in the light of the 
challenges, opportunities and current trends and activities relevant to dissemination and 
implementation, and the inputs received from stakeholders described above. The Working 
Group identified overarching strategic considerations, possible work streams and focus 
criteria, which together form a preliminary outline of the strategy that the Working Group 
will bring to bear in its mandate. The Working Group will seek to implement this strategy 
to the fullest extent possible, subject to the availability of resources. To that end, the 
Working Group will pursue collaboration with relevant partners and stakeholders wherever </p>


<p>possible and appropriate, with a view to matching resources and capacity to the activities 
and work streams proposed. The strategy will be further developed by the Working Group 
in its future reports and will be subject to periodic review throughout the mandate. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Strategic considerations 
</b></p>
<p>48. Transforming the Guiding Principles from agreed-upon practice standards to 
everyday standard practice is an undertaking of global proportions, and the Working Group 
underestimates neither the scale nor complexity of the challenge. In order to ensure 
relevance and responsiveness to current conditions, the Working Group has informed its 
strategy with elements of the economic, political and historical context described in the 
sections above. Three additional, and more specific, considerations informed the Working 
Group&#8217;s strategy:  
</p>
<p>(a)  The Guiding Principles will provide a common reference point in a diverse 
and rapidly evolving field;  
</p>
<p>(b)  The need for greater access by victims of business-related human rights abuse 
to effective remedies, which is urgent both in and of itself, as well as an important 
opportunity to drive implementation by setting the right incentives;  
</p>
<p>(c) In order to promote dissemination and implementation most effectively, there 
is a need to cultivate an environment conducive for the uptake of the Guiding Principles. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. The Guiding Principles: a common reference point in a rapidly developing field 
</b></p>
<p>49. As discussed above, some States and companies have already begun to implement 
the Guiding Principles. Implementation, fostered by increasing external pressures and 
growing internal commitment, will likely gather pace as awareness of the Guiding 
Principles grows and as more resources, guidance, projects and services are created to 
facilitate their uptake. At the same time, researchers, institutions and civil society 
organizations will offer new and refined interpretations and understandings of the Guiding 
Principles, which will complement dissemination and implementation efforts. The Working 
Group will seek to promote convergence, consistency, coordination and clarity of such 
efforts wherever possible and appropriate. In so doing, the Working Group will take into 
account, among other things, the considerations described below.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>50. <b>Promoting convergence</b>: The Guiding Principles are the point towards which 
existing and future human rights and business standards and related, tools, guidelines, 
resources, services and initiatives for companies and States should converge. The Guiding 
Principles should remain the authoritative basis of understanding of the respective 
responsibilities and duties of business enterprises and States, and how these should be 
operationalized in practice. This objective should be pursued without curtailing further 
enhancement of standards or extension of expectations beyond the benchmark provided by 
the Guiding Principles.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>51. <b>Avoiding duplication</b>: It will be important to prevent the duplication of activities, 
initiatives or contributions of others, as well as to avoid repetition, fragmentation and 
digression among current and emerging initiatives. Wherever possible and appropriate, the 
Working Group will seek to foster a central core of effort involving all parties, to share 
lessons learned and good practices between initiatives, and to ensure that separate 
initiatives are faceted and complementary, in order to meet the specific implementation 
challenges and opportunities presented by particular industry sectors and operating 
contexts, among other factors.<b> </b></p>


<p>52. <b>Maintaining integrity</b>: The integrity of the Guiding Principles should not be 
compromised by casual interpretations, conceptual detours or partial approaches. While the 
Working Group cannot feasibly influence or evaluate all of the current and emerging 
initiatives relating to the Guiding Principles, it will seek to articulate indicators for 
processes and outcomes by which all stakeholders may assess for themselves the 
effectiveness of particular existing and emerging tools, resources and services that may be 
helpful in supporting implementation by States and companies.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>Balanced development</b>: The success of the mandate presumes balanced promotion 
of implementation and dissemination on all three pillars of the Guiding Principles, and by 
all stakeholders. The Working Group will, when appropriate, engage to challenge and 
suggest ways to redress asymmetry in implementation as and when it arises.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>Clarity and simplicity</b>: In all of its activities, the Working Group will encourage 
clarity and simplicity. The importance of clear and simple concepts and their 
communication should not be underestimated. In a world of competing demands for the 
limited attention and resources of States and companies, the precision and brevity of 
dissemination tools will be a prerequisite for their success.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>Encouraging results</b>: Comprehensive and effective implementation of the Guiding 
Principles should eventually result in improvements in the protection against human rights 
abuse by business enterprises, a reduction in business-related human rights abuse, and 
improved access to effective remedies for victims of such harm where it occurs. 
Implementation should remain focused on addressing the most severe forms of human 
rights impact of business activities, as well as the impact that impinges on the rights of 
persons living in vulnerable situations. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Using the Guiding Principles to enhance accountability 
</b></p>
<p>56. Enhanced accountability of companies for involvement in human rights harm is 
clearly envisaged by the Guiding Principles. In particular, the Guiding Principles set out 
that providing for adequate accountability of companies for involvement in human rights 
harm, through judicial, administrative, legislative or other appropriate means, is an integral 
part of the State&#8217;s duty to protect. Initial consultations held by, and submissions made to, 
the Working Group clearly highlighted the importance of this aspect of the State&#8217;s duty to 
protect. The Working Group also recognizes the important role of enhanced accountability 
in promoting the uptake of the Guiding Principles, and thus ensuring comprehensive and 
effective implementation by companies. In this connection, the Working Group notes that it 
is specifically mandated to explore options and make recommendations at the national, 
regional and international levels for improving access to effective remedies. This could 
include, among other things, identifying opportunities to dismantle barriers to justice for 
victims of business-related human rights harm; identifying success factors in establishing 
effective judicial as well as non-judicial grievance mechanisms; discussing the 
consequences for States and businesses that fail to implement the Guiding Principles; and 
paying particular attention to rights-holders that may be particularly vulnerable to harm, or 
that may bear the brunt of adverse impact.  
</p>
<p>57. The Working Group recognizes that some groups and individuals face particularly 
significant obstacles when seeking remedies for business-related human rights grievances. 
Such groups may include indigenous peoples, children, women, migrant workers, older 
persons, persons with disabilities, refugees, ethnic, religious and other minorities. Among 
these, the challenging nexus between the role of the State, business activities and the 
situation of indigenous peoples was emphasized by a range of stakeholders.  
</p>
<p>58. In order to promote enhanced human rights accountability of business enterprises, as 
well as of States, the further uptake and application of the Guiding Principles by </p>


<p>international and regional bodies that have existing accountability mechanisms is necessary. 
The Working Group will seek to survey the landscape of existing accountability 
mechanisms in global and regional governance structures, as well as relevant private 
regulatory efforts, in order to identify gaps in coverage and opportunities to build upon and 
strengthen existing remedy channels. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Building an environment receptive to the Guiding Principles 
</b></p>
<p>59. Local contexts will not always be conducive to straightforward implementation or 
dissemination of the Guiding Principles. Many business enterprises operate in environments 
subject to little positive external pressure to respect human rights. Some companies may 
initially fail to see the relevance of the Guiding Principles to safeguarding and ensuring the 
sustainability of their business. To build a conducive environment for the uptake of the 
Guiding Principles, the Working Group appreciates that (a) stakeholders must be 
empowered to demand that States and business enterprises meet their respective duties and 
responsibilities; (b) actors committed to supporting implementation and dissemination 
efforts must be equipped with the appropriate tools, skills and resources; and (c) the 
&#8220;business case&#8221; for respecting human rights must be built for both States and business 
enterprises. With regard to all three aspects, promoting efforts to build the capacity of 
relevant actors is of key importance.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>60.<i> <b></b></i><b>Activate the demand for implementation of the Guiding Principles</b>: Investors, 
consumers, workers, trade unions, civil society and affected persons, including indigenous 
communities, demand in increasingly vocal and visible ways that States and business 
enterprises address the human rights impact of business activities. It is the basic expectation 
of society as a whole that companies should respect human rights throughout their 
operations and in their business relationships. These voices each add their weight to the 
demand for States and business to fulfil their duties and responsibilities as laid out in the 
Guiding Principles. As such, they play a crucial role in supporting uptake. The Working 
Group will therefore seek to promote dialogue between stakeholders, including by enabling 
such voices to be heard in its various efforts to aid in the dissemination and implementation 
of the Guiding Principles.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>61.<i> <b></b></i><b>Reach new audiences and actors</b>: For the Guiding Principles to achieve their true 
potential, they must be well understood and applied effectively by a wide audience of 
practitioners, in all regions. This will form part of a specific work stream for the Working 
Group (see paragraphs 63 &#8211; 74 below).<b> 
</b></p>
<p>62.<i> <b></b></i><b>Promoting the </b>&#8220;<b>business case</b>&#8221;<b> for States and business enterprises</b>: There is a 
growing body of testimony indicating that failure to address the human rights impact of 
business activities may in some cases lead to significant negative legal, financial, 
operational and reputational consequences for companies. At the same time, implementing 
the Guiding Principles can serve as an integral component of long-term value creation, 
corporate citizenship and business sustainability. With regard to implementation by States, 
ensuring enhanced protection against business-related human rights harm, and the 
promotion by States of business respect for human rights, may help to prevent significant 
social, economic and environmental costs while also contributing to more equitable, 
inclusive, broad-based and socially sustainable economic development outcomes. In 
addition to stressing these points, the Working Group will emphasize the legitimacy of the 
Guiding Principles, provided by their grounding in existing international human rights 
standards, institutional backing and multi-stakeholder support, their normative clarity and 
inherent utility, as well the increasing availability of tools and resources that may support 
their implementation by both States and companies. </p>


<p><b> B. Work streams and focus criteria  
</b></p>
<p>63. Led by the broad strategic considerations described above, and subject to available 
resources and capacity, the Working Group proposes to pursue three work streams through 
which it will deliver its mandate: global dissemination, promoting implementation, and 
embedding in global governance frameworks. Within these broad programmes of work, 
further focus criteria have been applied to shape the selection of particular priorities. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Global dissemination 
</b></p>
<p>64. The Working Group sees dissemination of the Guiding Principles not as an end in 
itself, but as a necessary means towards their comprehensive and effective implementation. 
Given the broad scope and limited time frame of the mandate, and in order to ensure that all 
relevant stakeholders are aware and understand the core content of the Guiding Principles, 
the Working Group will focus on disseminating the Guiding Principles to the actors where 
it considers that the contribution to implementation will be greatest. The Working Group 
will therefore prioritize its engagement to promote dissemination with actors that fall in the 
following categories: 
</p>
<p>(a)<i> New audiences</i>: Stakeholders who are not yet aware of the content or the 
implications of the Guiding Principles, who may include, for example, audiences outside 
OECD, domestic and extended supply-chain businesses, State-owned enterprises, small and 
medium-sized enterprises and networks of civil society, community-based and grass-roots 
organizations, among others; 
</p>
<p>(b)<i> Multipliers</i>: Networks and institutions that can disseminate the Guiding 
Principles to large groups of relevant actors; these include regional institutions, business 
associations, development agencies, and corporate social responsibility and sustainability 
platforms; 
</p>
<p>(c)<i> Catalysts</i>: Those able to assist in the prompt implementation of the Guiding 
Principles, including institutions and groups providing technical assistance and capacity-
building programmes to business and Governments, as well as groups that can help inform 
and empower communities to take up human rights issues affected by business operations, 
and create demand for implementation. It is expected that engagement of this group will 
promote the empowerment of rights-holders, and particularly communities in vulnerable 
situations, including indigenous communities, to become aware of and exercise their rights 
in the face of adverse impact caused by business. 
</p>
<p>65. The Working Group envisages that, through this programme of global 
dissemination, the Guiding Principles will bring much needed clarity to the innumerable 
business-related human rights challenges around the world by providing a common 
language and approach shared by all stakeholders. The ultimate aim is to support and create 
demand for implementation. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Promoting implementation 
</b></p>
<p>66. Many elements of the mandate of the Working Group point towards the overarching 
objective of the effective and comprehensive implementation of the Guiding Principles by 
States and enterprises. In this context, the Working Group highlights in particular the fact 
that the Human Rights Council instructed it to integrate a gender perspective throughout the 
work of the mandate and to give special attention to persons living in vulnerable situations, 
in particular children. Bearing this in mind, the Working Group foresees a variety of 
pathways towards implementation spanning a range of legal, institutional and business 
settings. Although the Working Group cannot drive or oversee implementation efforts 
alone, it can, and will, promote such efforts wherever possible and appropriate. This will </p>


<p>require collaboration, coordination and cooperation with others committed to the objectives 
of the mandate. In practical terms, the Working Group will seek to promote implementation 
in four principal ways.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>Address the situation of groups vulnerable to impact of business activities, 
including indigenous peoples</b>: Many factors can influence the vulnerability of rights-
holders to business-related human rights abuse. The Working Group will therefore accord 
broad interpretation to this aspect of its mandate in order to ensure appropriate attention to 
the wide range of rights-holders mentioned in the present report that are particularly 
vulnerable to the negative impacts of business activity. In particular, indigenous peoples in 
all regions are profoundly and disproportionately affected by business-related activities, 
such as resource extraction and infrastructure development. They frequently face 
discrimination in law and social practice and are marginalized in the development of 
policies, laws and regulations that have a bearing on business and human rights issues that 
affect them. Business-related human rights impact on individuals from groups or 
populations that may be at heightened risk of vulnerability or marginalization must be 
specifically addressed by States and companies in their implementation efforts.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>Encourage implementation efforts</b>: The Working Group will encourage 
implementation efforts by directly engaging with relevant actors (States, business and civil 
society), where possible, on the application of the Guiding Principles, by contributing to or 
participating in the implementation initiatives of other organizations, and by selectively 
initiating specific projects designed to further drive implementation, for example by 
encouraging the development of national plans of action and capacity-building efforts that 
have a bearing on implementation.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>69.<i> <b></b></i><b>Share good practices</b>: Important lessons are already being learned by pioneering 
implementers. These should be communicated across sectors and regions, for testing and 
application in new contexts. To this end, the Working Group will seek to identify, exchange 
and promote good practices, including by supporting their broad dissemination; in so doing, 
it will apply the principle that the practices it promotes must reasonably be expected to give 
effect to a standard no lower than that set out in the Guiding Principles themselves. The 
Working Group will apply this principle even in respect of implementation undertaken in 
the kinds of undeniably challenging contexts that States and companies may face. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>Provide further clarification on the application of the Guiding Principles</b>: 
Although they are universally applicable, the Guiding Principles are not intended as a tool 
kit, simply to be taken off the shelf and plugged in; in other words, when it comes to the 
means for implementation, &#8220;one size does not fit all&#8221;.32 The implementation of the Guiding 
Principles will inevitably give rise to questions and some need for further clarification in 
specific areas and contexts of actual practice. Just as the former Special Representative 
provided guidance, for example, on how management of human rights risks could be 
integrated into State-investor contract negotiations (work that resulted in the development 
of 10 principles for integrating management of human rights risks into contract 
negotiations),33 which now sets the stage for further clarification to support the practical 
application of this guidance in the development of responsible investment contracts, the 
need for further clarification in other areas remains. Questions such as the implications of 
the Guiding Principles for business enterprises providing services that may have an impact 
on the enjoyment of human rights have already been brought to the attention of the 
Working Group. A similar case can be seen in practices of export credit agencies and 
related institutions in implementing human rights due diligence measures. With regard to 
</p>
<p>  
 32 A/HRC/17/31, para. 15. 
 33 See A/HRC/17/31/Add.3. </p>


<p>the impact on specific groups, the implications for the State duty to protect, due diligence 
by business and provision of remedy with regard to the situation of indigenous peoples is 
yet another area for further clarification, including as it relates to the issue of consultation. 
While the Working Group cannot examine all the questions and dilemmas that may arise in 
the course of implementation of the Guiding Principles, it will identify and clarify the most 
salient issues wherever possible, and then encourage partners, including academic and 
practitioner networks, to develop and disseminate solutions appropriate to specific 
challenges, such as those arising with regard to particular industry sectors, geographies, 
stakeholder groups or business relationships. 
</p>
<p>71. Under the above four focus areas, the Working Group proposes to use &#8220;learning 
labs&#8221; to support States and business enterprises to address common implementation 
challenges. In the case of business, these challenges include the incorporation of human 
rights into risk management and due diligence processes, supply chains and grievance 
mechanisms. In the case of States, these include advancing policy coherence, identifying 
roles for national and subnational public agencies, and building capacity of public 
accountability bodies and judicial and non-judicial mechanisms. These learning labs will 
provide opportunities to cross-share lessons learned, and identify and understand winning 
approaches, in order to build on the successes of others.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Embedding in global governance frameworks 
</b></p>
<p>72. As its third major platform of work, the Working Group will seek to promote 
incorporation of the Framework and Guiding Principles into global governance 
frameworks. To this end, the Working Group will proactively seek to engage with 
institutions overseeing existing and emerging governance frameworks that are able to play 
a significant role in requiring, or otherwise encouraging, business enterprises and States to 
implement the Guiding Principles. The Working Group will encourage the embedding of 
the Guiding Principles into such frameworks, including regional and international 
agreements and institutions, industry associations, and responsibility, sustainability and 
investor ranking indices, among others.34 Guided by these considerations, and taking into 
account available resources and capacity, the Working Group will prioritize its engagement 
relating to those governance frameworks that (a) have effective accountability mechanisms; 
(b) can demonstrate a track record of adherence by members/participants to their tenets; (c) 
apply to a large number of actors; and (d) provide effective grievance mechanisms for 
affected individuals.  
</p>
<p>73. Throughout its work, the Working Group will seek to promote an active role for 
United Nations bodies in achieving the goals of its mandate.35 In this regard, the Working 
Group welcomes the mandate given to it by Human Rights Council to work in close 
cooperation and coordination and to develop regular dialogue with other relevant special 
procedures of the Human Rights Council, relevant United Nations and other international 
bodies, including the human rights treaty bodies. The importance of such coordination, 
</p>
<p>  
 34 As an example of the role of the Working Group in promoting alignment of other frameworks with 
</p>
<p>the Guiding Principles, see its background note to Governments involved with negotiating the Rio 
+20 outcome documents, available from 
www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/SP/BNUNGuidingPrinciplesBusinessHR.pdf. 
</p>
<p> 35 In 17/4, the Human Rights Council also requested the Secretary-General to prepare a report on how 
the United Nations system as a whole, including programmes and funds and specialized agencies, 
could contribute to the advancement of the business and human rights agenda and the dissemination 
and implementation of the Guiding Principles, addressing in particular how capacity-building of all 
relevant actors to this end could best be addressed within the United Nations system. The report will 
be presented to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-first session. </p>


<p>cooperation and dialogue has been reinforced by stakeholders during the initial 
consultations of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>74. In embedding the Guiding Principles in global governance structures, the Working 
Group will seek to complement and build upon the strength of important early successes, 
including the alignment of important frameworks under the auspices of OECD, the United 
Nations Global Compact, the European Commission and the International Finance 
Corporation with the Guiding Principles. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Engagement with stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Overall inclusive and consultative approach 
</b></p>
<p>75. The Working Group recognizes that the final measure of success of its mandate will 
be the extent to which the Guiding Principles are mainstreamed into &#8220;business-as-usual&#8221; for 
all stakeholders in business activities &#8211; whether they influence, lead or participate in, or are 
affected by the same. This places the principle of multi-stakeholder consultation and input 
at the core of the philosophy of the Working Group, with the aim of garnering the widest 
degree of support by stakeholders for both the process and the outcomes of the mandate. 
</p>
<p>76. The former Special Representative&#8217;s implementation of his mandate was 
characterized as being evidence-based (surveys, mappings of current practices and 
research); widely consultative and open to extensive multi-stakeholder participation (47 
consultations in five continents and many submissions) and pragmatic (focused on finding 
practical solutions to concerns of both State and non-State actors). Such an approach gave 
the mandate ample legitimacy and enabled it to propose an actual way forward, embodied 
today by the unanimous endorsement by the Human Rights Council of the Guiding 
Principles and in their uptake by public and private actors.36 
</p>
<p>77. The Working Group is firmly committed to these principles of work and inclusive 
engagement, not only because all stakeholders have recognized their value and 
effectiveness but because dialogue and participation are consistent with the essence of a 
rights-based approach. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Engagement with Member States 
</b></p>
<p>78. In the pursuit of its mandate, the Working Group intends to continue to engage in 
regular dialogue and cooperation with Member States.37 Engagement will be based on the 
commitment to an inclusive and consultative approach, and also on the basis that States 
bear, under international law, the primary obligation to promote and protect human rights 
and fundamental freedoms.  
</p>
<p>79. As provided by the mandate of the Working Group, it will also seek to provide 
advice and recommendations on good practices and lessons learned in the implementation 
of the Guiding Principles, on the development of domestic legislation and policies relating 
</p>
<p>  
 36 Since the first session of the Working Group, in January 2012, its members have already started to 
</p>
<p>engage with regional organizations, States, business enterprises, civil society organizations and 
United Nations bodies. 
</p>
<p> 37 Working Group members have participated in meetings held by individual States and consulted with 
regional organizations that have ongoing processes relating to the implementation of the Guiding 
Principles. </p>


<p>to business and human rights, and on enhancing access to effective remedies. Technical 
cooperation and advice will be conducted in a constructive manner and based on dialogue. 
</p>
<p>80. Given the nature of its mandate, and depending on the particular issue being 
addressed, the Working Group will seek to engage with Government authorities and public 
entities at different levels and across different functions. This will include governmental 
departments, agencies and other State-based institutions that shape business practices.  
</p>
<p>81. The Working Group welcomes the steps already initiated to explore how States and 
intergovernmental organizations can implement various aspects of the Guiding Principles 
through policy frameworks and guidance for business enterprises. In its efforts to identify 
good practices and lessons learned on aspects related to the State duty to protect and 
enhancing access to remedies, the Working Group will naturally seek to engage closely 
with these States and organizations, including by identifying challenges that may be 
addressed to promote further effective implementation. The Working Group also intends to 
engage with States in all regions in order to raise awareness of the Guiding Principles as 
widely as possible and to assist in the process of exchanging and promoting good practices. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Engagement with other stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>82. The Working Group aims to identify opportunities for strategic collaboration with 
those organizations identified within the resolution establishing the mandate, including 
relevant special procedures of the Human Rights Council, United Nations bodies, 
specialized agencies, funds and programmes, other international bodies, Governments, 
transnational corporations and other business enterprises, national human rights institutions, 
representatives of indigenous peoples, civil society organizations, regional and subregional 
organizations.38 Further to these, the Working Group seeks to establish both direct and 
indirect collaboration with business associations, academic institutions and think tanks, 
industry round tables, multi-stakeholder initiatives, trade union federations, thought leaders, 
human rights defenders addressing business activities and grass-roots organizations. 
</p>
<p>83. The specific nature of the collaboration with different partners will be shaped by the 
considerations outlined in the strategy section, including the ability of the collaboration to 
be a &#8220;multiplier&#8221; and exponentially reach a wider audience than would be possible through 
the effort of the Working Group acting alone, and extend stakeholder groups in terms of 
both the type of stakeholders (for example, actors from different regions of the world) and 
the breadth within each stakeholder group (for example, from transnational corporations to 
small and medium-sized enterprises within the business stakeholder group). 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Working methods 
</b></p>
<p>84. Following the deliberations held at its first session, and on the basis of inputs and 
submissions received from States and other relevant stakeholders prior to and during the 
session itself, the Working Group issued a statement on the methods of work it intends to 
follow in the implementation of its mandate. 
</p>
<p>  
 38 For example, members of the Working Group have engaged with the United Nations Conference on 
</p>
<p>Trade and Development in preparation for the 2012 World Investment Report. </p>


<p><b> A. Chairperson-Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>85. The Working Group decided to rotate the function of Chairperson-Rapporteur after 
every two sessions of the Working Group. Margaret Jungk was appointed as Chairperson-
Rapporteur for the first and second sessions. The Working Group will hold its second 
session from 7 to 11 May 2012 in Geneva. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Country missions and other field work 
</b></p>
<p>86. In accordance with its mandate, the Working Group will carry out two official 
country missions every year following the invitations received from Member States. 
Country missions will be conducted in the spirit of promoting constructive dialogue with 
States and all relevant stakeholders at the national level, and will have the aim of 
identifying, exchanging and promoting good practices and lessons learned in the 
implementation of the Guiding Principles. The Working Group intends to approach States 
that have issued standing invitations to special procedures, and encourages other States, 
from all geographic regions, to issue invitations to the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>87. In addition to official country missions and other visits to Member States, the 
Working Group aims to carry out its mandate in a manner that includes significant 
additional relevant field work across all regions to inform its work and to ensure that any 
findings and recommendations respond to practical and operational realities on the ground. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Receiving information 
</b></p>
<p>88. In the context of promoting the effective dissemination and implementation of the 
Guiding Principles, the Working Group was mandated by the Human Rights Council, in its 
resolution 17/4, to seek and receive information from all relevant sources, including 
Governments, transnational corporations and other business enterprises, national human 
rights institutions, civil society and rights-holders.  
</p>
<p>89. Information received from relevant stakeholders relating to specific human rights 
violations will be used as appropriate by the Working Group to inform its work and 
strategy, to identify barriers to the effective implementation of the Guiding Principles and 
gaps in the protection of human rights in the context of business activities, and to inform 
recommendations made to States, business and other actors on the implementation of the 
Guiding Principles. Given the broad scope of its mandate, the vast scale and complexity of 
the issue at hand, and resource constraints, the Working Group is not in a position to 
investigate individual cases of alleged business-related human rights abuse. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Forum on Business and Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>90. The first annual multi-stakeholder Forum on Business and Human Rights will be 
open to relevant stakeholders, in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 17/4, 
and be held in Geneva on 4 and 5 December 2012. The Working Group will decide on the 
thematic focus areas and modalities of the Forum at its second session, following further 
elaboration of its programme of substantive work and taking into consideration the 
proposals already received from stakeholders at its initial consultations. </p>


<p><b> IX. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>91.<b> The present report outlines the strategy that the Working Group will bring to 
bear in pursuit of the mandate conferred upon it by the Human Rights Council. This 
</b></p>
<p><b>strategy is informed by consultation inputs and submissions from States, business 
</b></p>
<p><b>enterprises and associations, civil society organizations and concerned individuals that 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Working Group has received to date. 
</b></p>
<p>92.<b> The Working Group is acutely aware of the complexities and sensitivities that 
surround its mandate. It nevertheless remains seized of the imperative to take 
</b></p>
<p><b>whatever appropriate steps are necessary in order to secure the greatest protection of 
</b></p>
<p><b>and respect for human rights in the context of business activities. 
</b></p>
<p>93.<b> The Working Group acknowledges that business is a manifestation of 
opportunity, through the transformation of factors of production </b>&#8211;<b> land, labour, 
</b></p>
<p><b>finance and technology </b>&#8211;<b> into goods or services, which can contribute to economic 
</b></p>
<p><b>development. Current incentive structures for business, however, too often lead to 
</b></p>
<p><b>decisions that are detrimental to the enjoyment of human rights. By the same token, 
</b></p>
<p><b>incentive structures are neither inevitable nor immutable. By meeting their 
</b></p>
<p><b>differentiated but complementary responsibilities, as outlined in the Guiding 
</b></p>
<p><b>Principles, States and business enterprises have the potential to ensure that economic 
</b></p>
<p><b>growth is achieved through more inclusive, equitable business practices. 
</b></p>
<p>94.<b> The Guiding Principles are a powerful enabler for better decision-making by 
States and enterprises alike. The approach of the Guiding Principles to respecting 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights, taking due stock of risks to and impact on rights-holders, and ensuring that 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective channels for recourse and remedy for victims are made available, offer a 
</b></p>
<p><b>road map for doing business better by lowering risk, creating opportunity, avoiding 
</b></p>
<p><b>conflict, improving external relations, safeguarding productivity and enhancing value. 
</b></p>
<p>95.<b> To this end, the inherent utility and strong, growing authority of the Guiding 
Principles as the authoritative global reference point on human rights and business 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be leveraged to maximum effect. The Working Group intends to do precisely 
</b></p>
<p><b>that. The Guiding Principles present an unprecedented opportunity to focus the good 
</b></p>
<p><b>efforts of States, businesses and civil society on the unified goal of universal business 
</b></p>
<p><b>respect for human rights, for the benefit of rights-holders everywhere. 
</b></p>
<p>    </p>
