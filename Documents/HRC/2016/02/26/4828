Enforced or involuntary disappearances 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming </i>the relevant articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which protect the right to life, 
liberty and security of person, the right not to be subjected to torture and the right to 
recognition as a person before the law, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>Commission on Human Rights resolution 20 (XXXVI) of 29 February 
1980, in which the Commission established a working group to examine questions relevant 
to enforced or involuntary disappearances, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>all previous resolutions on enforced or involuntary disappearances of 
the Council, the Commission on Human Rights and the General Assembly, the most recent 
being Council resolution 10/10 of 26 March 2009 and Assembly resolution 64/167 of 
18 December 2009, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling further </i>General Assembly resolution 47/133 of 18 December 1992, in 
which the Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance, 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging </i>the adoption of the International Convention for the Protection of 
All Persons from Enforced Disappearance by the General Assembly in its resolution 61/177 
of 20 December 2006, and recognizing that the entry into force of the Convention as soon 
as possible through its ratification by twenty States, and its implementation, will be a 
significant contribution to ending impunity and to the promotion and protection of all 
human rights for all, 
</p>
<p>  
 * The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of 
</p>
<p>the Council on its fourteenth session (A/HRC/14/37), chap. I. 
</p>

<p><i> Recalling</i> Council resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the United Nations 
Human Rights Council and 5/2 on the code of conduct for special procedures mandate 
holders of the Council, of 18 June 2007, stressing that all mandate holders shall discharge 
their duties in accordance with these resolutions and the annexes thereto, and urging all 
States to cooperate with and assist the special procedures in the performance of their tasks, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned </i>by the high number of cases of enforced or involuntary 
disappearance around the world, including arrest, detention and abduction, when these are 
part of or amount to enforced disappearances, and by the growing number of reports 
concerning harassment, ill-treatment and intimidation of witnesses of disappearances or 
relatives of persons who have disappeared, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the importance of the right of victims to the truth as defined in Council 
resolution 12/12 of 1 October 2009, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also</i> that no one shall be held in secret detention, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that enforced disappearance has special consequences for vulnerable 
groups, especially women and children, as they most often bear the serious economic 
hardships which usually accompany a disappearance and, when they are subjected to 
disappearance themselves, they may become particularly vulnerable to sexual and other 
forms of violence, 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging </i>that acts of enforced disappearance may amount to crimes against 
humanity as defined in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the Set of Principles for the protection and promotion of human rights 
through action to combat impunity (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1997/20/Rev.1, annex II), and taking 
note with appreciation of the updated version of those principles (E/CN.4/2005/102/Add.1), 
</p>
<p><i> Commemorating </i>the thirtieth anniversary of the establishment of the Working Group 
on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, and taking this opportunity to raise awareness

Working Group in its reports; 
</p>
<p> 3.<i> Calls upon</i> Governments to offer support to all victims of enforced 
disappearances, especially women and children affected by this crime;

disappearances, including by ensuring that secret places of detention and interrogation are 
abolished; 
</p>
<p> 5.<i> Urges</i> Governments to continue their efforts to elucidate the fate of 
disappeared persons and to ensure that competent authorities in charge of investigation and 
prosecution are provided with adequate means and resources to resolve cases and bring 
perpetrators to justice, including after considering the establishment, where appropriate, of 
specific judicial mechanisms or truth and reconciliation commissions that complement the 
justice system; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Invites</i> the Working Group to provide the concerned State with relevant 
information, that is as detailed as possible, concerning allegations of enforced 
disappearances in order to facilitate a prompt and substantive response to these </p>


<p>communications, without prejudice to the need for the concerned State to cooperate with 
the Working Group; 
</p>
<p> 7.<i> Requests </i>the Secretary-General to ensure that the Working Group receives all 
the assistance and resources it requires to perform its mandate;

Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and eighteen 
States have ratified or acceded to it, and calls upon States that have not yet done so to

Enforced Disappearances, with a view to its entry into force by September 2010; 
</p>
<p> 9.<i> Invites </i>States to consider joining all efforts to share information on best 
practices and to work towards the early entry into force of the Convention with the aim of 
its universality; 
</p>
<p> 10.<i> Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to organize, within existing resources, a one-day event to commemorate the thirtieth 
anniversary of the Working Group; 
</p>
<p> 11.<i> Encourages</i> the General Assembly to proclaim 30 August the International 
Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearances;
