<p><b>Report of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children, Ms. Joy Ngozi Ezeilo, 
following the visit to Seychelles (27-31 January 2014) 
</b>1. The following are the comments and proposed amendments to the report of Special 
Rapporteur on Trafficking in Persons, by the Ministry of Foreign. 
</p>
<p>2. The Statement on Page 7, point 3, indicating that &#8220;In February 2013, as a result of 
increased complaints from Malagasy domestic workers regarding their treatment in the 
Seychelles, Madagascar instituted a ban on sending additional Malagasy citizens to the 
Seychelles for such work.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>3. The Embassy of Madagascar in Mauritius, as well as the Seychelles Honorary 
Consul based in Madagascar have both confirmed that, as a result of violence perpetrated 
against Malagasy workers in Lebanon and the Gulf Region in general, the Malagasy 
authorities have made a decision to suspend the recruitment of Malagasy workers in Middle 
Eastern countries. This matter does not concern the Seychelles in anyway.  
</p>
<p>4. The Head of Migration Services at the Ministry of Labour in Madagascar, who 
manages all the contracts of outgoing Malagasy workers, through our Honorary Consul in 
Madagascar, has further confirmed the same, and has stated that there has been only 
positive feedback of Malagasy workers who have been or are currently based in the 
Seychelles. Therefore, reiterating that there has been no reason to deny Seychelles of such 
human resources from Madagascar. The following persons have been direct sources of the 
aforementioned information regarding the case of the Malagasy workers: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Mr. Richard VIA, Charg&#233; d&#8217;Affaires for Madagascar, Embassy of Madagascar in 
Mauritius.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Mr. Sylvain DE COMARMOND, Honorary Consul General of Seychelles in 
Madagascar. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Madame Aurette Marguerite RAZANAZAFY, Head of Migration Services at the 
Ministry of Labour in Madagascar 
</p>
<p>Please kindly refer to the official Note Verbale N&#176;: 057 / 14 / SDC as an annex by the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Madagascar, confirming the above information.  
</p>
<p>5. The following are the recommended amendments to information regarding the 
Department of Social Affairs at the Ministry of Social Affairs, Community Development 
and Sport :  
</p>
<p><b>  Proposal for Amendments to the Report of the Special Rapporteur on 
Trafficking in Persons submitted by the Department of Social Affairs. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Page 10 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Paragraph 30:</b> While not directly working on anti-trafficking issues, the 
Department of Social Affairs under the Ministry of Social Affairs, Community 
Development and Sports aims inter alia, to restore social functioning and alleviate 
social problems by safeguarding the interest and promoting the well-being of 
children as well as integrating and protecting marginalized and vulnerable groups. 
Social workers of the Community Social Work Section deal with cases of domestic 
violence, substance abuse, mental health, placement, anti-social behaviour, teenage 
pregnancy and neglect. Cases are identified through their regular visits to schools, 
health centers and police stations as well as the Department&#8217;s 24 hour Children&#8217;s </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.8 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>helpline. Cases are identified through their regular visits to schools, health centres 
and police stations as well as the Department&#8217;s 24 hour Children&#8217;s helpline. The 
majority of the cases are also identified through clients who walk in at headquarters 
or at the district administration Offices where the community social workers are 
based.  
</p>
<p><b>  Page 11 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Paragraph 31:</b> A shelter for orphans and a child in need up to the age of eighteen, 
namely The Presidents Village, is run under the patronage of the First Lady. Three 
other homes for children are run by the Catholic Church.  
</p>
<p><b>  Page 12 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Paragraph 39</b>: Identification of victims is further exacerbated by the lack of clear 
legal distinction between prostitution and internal trafficking for sexual purposes. In 
this regard, social workers of the Department of Social Affairs related cases whereby 
some Seychellois men force their girlfriends into prostitution in order to earn money 
for the couple&#8217;s drug addiction. The Department also identified 580 sexual related 
abuses committed on children from 2009 to 2013. Unfortunately, neither these cases 
nor other similar ones have been correctly identified as trafficking in persons for the 
purpose of sexual exploitation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Page 13 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Paragraph 43</b>: At the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, there were no shelters 
and psycho-social support specifically intended for victims of trafficking. However, 
the Social Affairs Department runs homes which provide welfare assistance to 
children in need and in other difficult living situations up to 18 years, who are 
subject to protection measures and assist with their reintegration into the society. It 
also runs a children&#8217;s telephone hotline for victims of violence. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Paragraph 44</b>: The Special Rapporteur the President&#8217;s village shelter  managed by 
the Department of Social Affairs which had 54 children up to the age of 18 years, 
including infants. The centre provides a family environment to orphans and children 
whose parents are faced with socio-economic difficulties. This includes educational 
and vocational support, medical and psychosocial services to children. The Special 
Rapporteur notes the overall adequate standard of the facility and services provided. 
</p>
<p><b>  Page 15

<p>&#8226; <b>Paragraph 56</b>: In addition, the potential of key institutions such as the Ministries of 
Tourism; Employment; Social Affairs; Health; law enforcement authorities 
</p>
<p>6. The Ministry of Labour and Human Resource Development have made the 
following proposals for amendments to the report :  
</p>
<p><b>  Response on report of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children, Dr. Joy Ngozi Ezeilo &#8211; Mission to 
Seychelles from 27 to 31 January 2014 submitted by the Ministry of 
Labour and Human Resource Development

<p><b> Paragraph 13:</b> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.8 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b> </b>&#8220;A significant portion of migrants work within the Seychelles International Trade 
Zone where adherence to all national labour and immigration laws is not required. 
This renders workers more vulnerable to possible situations of forced labour&#8221;  
</p>
<p><i>  Comments from the Ministry of Labour and Human Resource Development:  
</i>&#8226; The Employment Act 1995 is not applicable to the Seychelles International Trade 
</p>
<p>Zone (SITZ) however the International Trade Zone (Employment) Regulations 1997 
and the International Trade Zone (Conditions of Employment) Order 1997, are 
applicable and do not make the workers any more vulnerable to situations of forced 
labour than workers who work outside of the SITZ. In addition, forced or obligatory 
labour is prohibited in Article 17 of the Constitution and in Section 251 of the Penal 
Code which are both applicable to workers outside of and within the Seychelles 
International Trade Zone.  
</p>
<p><b>  Page 6:  
</b></p>
<p><b> Paragraph 13: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;According to official statistics, the vast majority of the migrant workers, which 
constitutes about 1/5 of the population of the country, are employed in the fishing 
and construction sectors, comprising nearly one-third of the total workforce.&#8221;  
</p>
<p><i>  Comments from the Ministry of Labour and Human Resource Development:  
</i>&#8226; The highest numbers of foreign workers are employed in the Manufacturing and 
</p>
<p>Construction industries instead of fishing.  
</p>
<p><b>  Page 6:  
</b></p>
<p><b> Paragraph 14: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;Over the past two years, a number of public demonstrations held by groups of 
migrant workers to peacefully protest about their working conditions resulted in 
their deportation&#8221;  
</p>
<p><i>  Comments from the Ministry of Labour and Human Resource Development:  
</i>&#8226; The groups of migrant workers being referred to above left the country voluntarily 
</p>
<p>as a consequence of the breach of their working conditions by their respective 
employers, after payment of their dues and claims of airfare tickets was ordered and 
enforced by the Employment Tribunal.  
</p>
<p><b>  Pages 8&#8211;9:  
</b></p>
<p><b> Paragraph 22 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;Minimum labour protection standards, including working hours, paid leave and, 
regular payment of wages are set out in the Employment Act, which governs the 
relationship between workers and their employers. With regards to migrant workers, 
the Employment Act extends its scope to Non-Seychellois workers and contains 
provisions that prohibit labour exploitation. However, this and other national laws 
such as immigration laws do not apply to migrant workers within the Seychelles 
International Trade Zone as well as migrant domestic workers which may be victims 
of trafficking&#8221;.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.8 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Comments from the Ministry of Labour and Human Resource Development:  
</i>&#8226; The Employment Act 1995 does not apply to migrant workers within the Seychelles 
</p>
<p>International Trade Zone, but the International Trade Zone (Employment) 
Regulations 1997 and the International Trade Zone (Conditions of Employment) 
Order 1997 are applicable. Working hours, paid leave and regular payment of 
wages, which are minimum labour protection standards regulated in the 
Employment Act, are also regulated in these two pieces of legislation, which also 
extend their scope to Non-Seychellois workers (Regulation 41 of the Trade Zone 
(Employment) Regulations 1997). It can be noted that the process of recruitment of 
migrant workers within the Seychelles International Trade Zone is also overseen in 
the above pieces of legislation and the compulsory attestation of contracts reduces 
the risks of trafficking.  
</p>
<p><b>  Page 7:  
</b></p>
<p><b> Paragraph 15 &amp; 16 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;A case in point involves nine Pakistani fishermen allegedly abandoned in a port in 
Victoria for nine months.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;A case in point involves a Mauritian victim of domestic servitude identified by a 
health worker who realised that her passport was withheld by her employer and that 
she had not received payment for her work.&#8221;  
</p>
<p><i>  Comments from the Ministry of Labour and Human Resource Development:  
</i>&#8226; The Industrial Relations section does not have records of the two cases cited.  
</p>
<p><b>  Page 12:  
</b></p>
<p><b> Paragraph 38 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;Additionally, in spite of the increasing number of foreigners engaged in domestic 
work, and allegation of abuses, victims of trafficking for domestic servitude have 
not been identified because of the hidden nature of their work, the fact that they fall 
outside the purview of the Labour law and that labour inspections are not conducted 
in private homes.&#8221;  
</p>
<p><i>  Comments from the Ministry of Labour and Human Resource Development:  
</i>&#8226; The Employment Act 1995 does apply to migrant domestic workers who therefore 
</p>
<p>benefit of the same minimum labour protection standards as other workers. Hence 
they do not fall outside the purview of the labour law.  </p>
