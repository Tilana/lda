2.      
The accuseds first appeared in the High Court on 1st March 2013, and were all remanded in custody. On 20th March 2013, the accuseds, through their counsel, filed a notice of motion and an affidavit in support, seeking bail. The prosecution filed a written submission in reply on 3rd May 2013. I heard the parties on the same day, and adjourned for a ruling on 16th May, 2013. On 16th May, 2013, I declined the accuseds bail application, and said I would give my reasons later. Below are my reasons.

3. I have carefully read and considered the parties papers filed by the parties. I have also read and considered the substantive file HAC 094 of 2013S.

4. It is well settled that, an accused person is entitled to bail pending trial, unless the interest of justice requires otherwise (section 3(1) of the Bail Act 2002). It is also well settled that, the primary consideration in deciding whether to grant bail is the likelihood of the accused person turning up in court to take his trial on the date arranged (section 17 (2) of the Bail Act 2002). It is also well settled that, in order for the court to decide the above issue, it is mandatory for it to consider each of the factors mentioned in section 19 of the Bail Act 2002, that is, the likelihood of the accused surrendering to custody, the interest of the accused and the public interest and protection of the community.

Factor No. 1: The Likelihood of Accused Surrendering to Custody:

5. I will deal with all accuseds together under this head. Looking at the accuseds' caution interview statements, it appeared all accused were related as brothers. Qativi was the eldest at 37, followed by Lesumailodoni who was 31, and Waqanaceva was 30 years. According to the prosecution, these offences were allegedly planned and jointly executed by the three brothers. On paper, the State's case against the accuseds appeared strong, because they allegedly confessed to the crime. If found guilty, they faced a possible sentence of more than 8 years imprisonment. Under this head, the accuseds' chances of bail are slim.

Factor No. 2: The Interest of the Accused Persons:

6.      
I will deal with all accuseds together under this head. The trial of this case will probably take place mid or late next year. They have been in custody since 1st March 2013, so they have spent approximately 4 months in custody. However, time spent in custody will be deducted from their final sentence, if found guilty, in this case. I understand a new remand centre worth $11 million dollars, was open this week, thus the accuseds would enjoy new facilities. They are represented by counsel, and he can visit them at the remand centre, to take instructions. There appears to be no need for them to be at liberty for other lawful reasons. They are not incapacitated. Under this head, the accuseds' chances of bail are slim.

Factor No. 3: Public Interest and Protection of the Community:

7.      
The allegations against the accuseds are very serious. They allegedly planned these burglaries and theft on the complainants, drove from Nadi to Waidroka and committed the offences. The complainants at Waidroka need to be protected from the accuseds and like-minded people. Although all accuseds are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt, in a court of law, in my view, it is in the public interest and the protection of the community that, they be remanded in custody, until further orders of the court. Under this head, the accuseds' chances of bail are slim.
 
Conclusion:

8.      
Given the above, I refused the accuseds' bail applications on 16th May 2013, and the above are my reasons. They are remanded in custody until further orders of the court.
