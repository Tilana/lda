REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
Yukon Gold Corporation, Inc.  
(An Exploration Stage Mining Company) 
 
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Yukon Gold Corporation, Inc. (the “Company”) as at April 30, 2011 and 2010 and the related statements of operations, cash 
flows and stockholders’ deficiency for the years ended April 30, 2011 and 2010 and for the period from incorporation to April 30, 2011. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
the  audits  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  financial  statements  are  free  of  material  misstatement.  An  audit  includes  examining,  on  a  test  basis,  evidence
supporting  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements.  An  audit  also  includes  assessing  the  accounting  principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Yukon Gold Corporation, Inc. as at April 30, 2011 and
2010 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended April 30, 2011 and 2010 and for the period from incorporation to April 30, 2011 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the
Company is an exploration stage mining company and has no established source of revenues. These conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going
concern. Management’s plans regarding these matters are also described in note 2 to the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
As disclosed in Note 1 and Note 11, the financial statements have been adjusted for the retrospective presentation of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary as discontinued 
operations. Additionally, as discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company deconsolidated the assets and liabilities and results of operations of the wholly-owned 
subsidiary as of November 15, 2010.

YUKON GOLD CORPORATION, INC. 
(An Exploration Stage Mining Company) 
Notes to Financial Statements 
April 30, 2011 and April 30, 2010 
(Amounts expressed in US Dollars)
1.             NATURE OF OPERATIONS
The Company is an exploration stage mining company and has not yet realized any revenue from its operations. On November 15, 2010, the Company’s wholly-owned Canadian 
subsidiary, Yukon Gold Corp. (“YGC”), declared bankruptcy with the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy Canada and appointed a trustee under the Bankruptcy and
Insolvency Act. A Certificate of Appointment, under Section 49 of the Act; Rule 85, was filed with the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy Canada, in the District of
Ontario, Hamilton Division. As  a result  of  the  bankruptcy,  the Company’s ownership  interest  in  YGC  was  cancelled.  In  the accompanying  audited  financial statements, the 
historic  results  of  YGC  have  been  reported  as  a  discontinued  operation  (See  Note  11  Bankruptcy  of  Yukon  Gold  Corp.).  The  Company  is  currently  pursuing  other  mining
opportunities.
Subsequent to the year ended April 30, 2011 on May 16, 2011, the Company merged into its wholly-owned subsidiary, a Nevada corporation, (referred to herein as the “Nevada 
Corporation”)  being  the  surviving  entity  (the  “Merger”).  As  a  result,  Yukon  Gold  Corporation,  Inc.  effected  a  re-domiciliation from  the  State  of  Delaware  into  the  State  of 
Nevada. The Nevada Corporation, also named “Yukon Gold Corporation, Inc.”, has authorized capital of 500,000,000 common shares. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger, each
five (5) shares of the Company’s common stock immediately before the Merger were exchanged for one (1) share of common stock of the Nevada Corporation. As a result, 
148,159,936 issued shares of the Company’s common stock were exchanged for 29,632,336 shares of the Nevada Corporation’s common stock (See Note 13 (a) Subsequent
Events). The par value of the Company’s common shares remains at $0.0001 per share. All references to common shares and per common share amounts have been retroactively
adjusted from the date of inception to reflect the five-for-one reverse stock split, unless otherwise noted.
2.             BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND GOING CONCERN
The Company's financial statements are presented on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of
business. The Company has no source for operating revenue and expects to incur significant expenses before establishing operating revenue. Due to continuing operating losses
and cash outflows from continuing operations, the Company’s continuance as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain adequate financing and to reach profitable
levels of operation. In the event that the Company is unable to raise additional capital, as to which there is no assurance, the Company will not be able to continue doing business.
The Company’s future success is dependent upon its continued ability to raise sufficient capital, not only to maintain its operating expenses, but to acquire properties and explore 
for reserves. There is no guarantee that such capital will be available on acceptable terms, if at all, or if the Company will attain profitable levels of operation.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally acceptable accounting principles applicable to a going concern. Accordingly, they do
not give effect to adjustments that would be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern and therefore be required to realize its assets and liquidate its
liabilities and commitments in other than the normal course of business and at amounts different from those in the accompanying financial statements.

April 30, 2011 and April 30, 2010 
(Amounts expressed in US Dollars)
3.             SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a)             Use of Estimates
The Preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and related notes to the financial statements. These estimates are based on management's knowledge of
current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future. Actual results may differ from such estimates. Significant estimates include accruals, valuation allowance of
deferred tax asset and estimates for calculation of stock based compensation.
b)             Financial Instruments
The fair market value of the Company’s financial instruments comprising cash and accounts payable and accrued liabilities were estimated to approximate their carrying values
due to immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The Company maintains cash balances at financial institutions. The Company has not experienced any
material losses in such accounts.
Commodity Price Risk: The ability of the Company to develop its properties and the future profitability of the Company is directly related to the market price of certain minerals.
Foreign Exchange Risk: The Company conducts some of its operating activities in Canadian dollars. The Company is therefore subject to gains or losses due to fluctuations in
Canadian currency relative to the US dollar. The Company does not use foreign currency hedging to mitigate the risk.
c)             Equipment
Equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is provided over the estimated useful lives commencing in the month following acquisition using the
following annual rate and method:

c)             Equipment-Cont’d

d)             Income taxes
30%
declining balance method
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of the assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible
amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be
realized. Income tax expense is recorded for the amount of income tax payable or refundable for the period increased or decreased by the change in deferred tax assets and
liabilities during the period.
e)             Revenue Recognition
The Company’s revenue recognition policies are expected to follow common practice in the mining industry. Revenue is recognized when concentrate or dore bars, in the case of
precious metals, is produced in a mill processing ore from one or more mines. The only condition for recognition of revenue in these instances is the production of the dore or
concentrate. In order to get the ore to a concentrate stage the ore must be mined and transported to a mill where it is crushed and ground. The ground product is then processed by
gravity separation and/or flotation to produce a concentrate. In some circumstances chemical treatment is used to extract the precious metals from the concentrate into a solution.
This solution is then subjected to various processes to precipitate the precious metals back to a solid state that can be melted down and poured into a mould to produce a dore bar
(a combination of gold and silver).

3.             SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES-CONT’D
f)             Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company records impairment of long-lived assets to be held, used or to be disposed of when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated
to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount. The Company did not record any impairment as of April 30, 2011 and April 30, 2010.
g)             Acquisition, Exploration and Evaluation Expenditures
The Company is an exploration stage mining company and has not yet realized any revenue from its operations. It is primarily engaged in the acquisition and exploration of
mining properties. Mineral property exploration costs are expensed as incurred. Mineral property payments are initially capitalized in accordance with the ASC 805-20-55-37, 
previously referenced as EITF 04-2 when incurred. The Company will assess the carrying costs for impairment under Accounting Standards 930 Extractive Activities – Mining 
(AS 930) at each fiscal quarter end. An impairment is recognized when the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the mineral
property. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the mineral property over its estimated fair value. When it has been determined that a
mineral property can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves, the costs incurred to develop such property will be capitalized. Once
capitalized, such costs will be amortized using the units-of-production method over the estimated life of the probable reserves.
h)             Stock Based Compensation
All awards granted to employees and non-employees after October 31, 2005 are valued at fair value by using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and recognized on a straight 
line basis over the service periods of each award. The Company accounts for equity instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from other than employees
using the estimated fair market value of the consideration received or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The value
of equity instruments issued for consideration other than employee services is determined on the earlier of a performance commitment or completion of performance by the
provider  of  goods  or  services.  As  of  April  30,  2011  and  April  30,  2010,  there  was  $nil  and  $nil  of  unrecognized  expense  related  to  non-vested  stock-based  compensation 
arrangements granted. The total stock-based compensation expense relating to all employees and non-employees for the years ended April 30, 2011 and 2010 was $nil and $5,869 
respectively.
i)             Earnings or Loss per Share
Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the year. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing
net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus common stock equivalents (if dilutive) related to stock options and warrants for each year. The
dilutive shares are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings loss per share when a net loss is recorded for the period, as their effect would be anti-dilutive.

j)             Recent Pronouncements
Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance
On May 1, 2010, the Company adopted FASB ASU 2010-04, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASU 2010-06). ASU 2010-06 updates FASB ASC 820, Fair Value 
Measurements. ASU 2010-06 requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements including transfers in and out of levels 1 and 2 and a higher level of disaggregation 
for the different types of financial instruments. There was no material impact on the Company’s financial statements related to the adoption of this guidance.
Business Combinations: In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-29, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for
Business  Combinations.”  The  new  guidance  specifies  that  when  comparative  financial  statements  are  presented,  the  revenue  and  earnings  of  the  combined  entity  should  be
disclosed as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. The
new guidance applies prospectively to us for business combinations which occur on or after May 1, 2011. The impact of these new provisions on our consolidated financial
statements will depend upon the nature, terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate in the future. 
 
Fair Value: In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure 
Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs.” The new guidance does not extend the use of fair value accounting, but provides guidance on how it should be applied where its use is
already required or permitted by other standards within GASP or International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”). The new guidance also changes the working used to 
describe  many  requirements  in  GAAP  for  measuring  fair  value  and  for  disclosing  information  about  fair  value  measurements  and  it  clarifies  the  FASB’s  intent  about  the 
application of existing fair value measurements. The new guidance applies prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We
will adopt the provisions of this new guidance on January 1, 2012. We do not expect the adoption of the new provisions to have a material impact on our financial condition or
results of operations. 
 
Comprehensive Income: In  June  2011,  the FASB  issued ASU  2011-05,  “Comprehensive  Income (Topic  220): Presentation  of Comprehensive Income.”  The new guidance 
requires that all non-owner changes in stockholders’ equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive 
statements. In both cases, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a
total  for  other  comprehensive  income,  and  a  total  amount  for  comprehensive  income.  If  presented  in  a  single  continuous  statement,  the  entity  is  required  to  present  the
components of net income and total net income, the components of other comprehensive income and a total for other comprehensive income, along with a total of comprehensive
income in that statement. If presented in the two-statement approach, the first statement which is the statement of net income, should present components of net income and total 
net income followed consecutively by a second statement which is the statement of other comprehensive income, that should present the components of other comprehensive
income, total other comprehensive income and a total amount for comprehensive income. Regardless of the method used, the entity if required to present on the face of the
financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement where the components of net
income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented. The new guidance is effective retrospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2011. We will adopt the provisions of this new guidance on January 1, 2012. We do not expect the adoption of the new provisions to have a
material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

7.             STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
Per SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 107, Topic 14.F, “Classification of Compensation Expense Associated with Share-Based Payment Arrangements” stock based compensation 
expense is being presented in the same lines as cash compensation paid.
The  Company  adopted  a  new  Stock  Option  Plan  at  its  shareholders  meeting  on  January  19,  2007  (the  “2006  Stock  Option  Plan”).  The  2006  Stock  Option  Plan  will  be 
administered by the board of directors of the Company or, in the board of directors’ discretion, by a committee appointed by the board of directors for that purpose. Subject to the
provisions of the 2006 Stock Option Plan, the aggregate number of shares which may be issued under the 2006 Stock Option Plan shall not exceed 2,000,000 shares ("Total
Shares"). On March 18, 2008 at the Annual and Special Meeting of Shareholders, the Shareholders of the Company approved an amendment to the 2006 Stock Option Plan
increasing the number of Shares reserved for issuance thereunder from 2,000,000 to 2,899,044. Any Stock Option granted under the 2006 Stock Option Plan which has been
exercised shall again be available for subsequent grant under the 2006 Stock Option Plan, effectively resulting in a re-loading of the number of shares available for grant under 
the 2006 Stock Option Plan. Any shares subject to an option granted under the 2006 Stock Option Plan which for any reason is surrendered, cancelled or terminated or expires
without having been exercised shall again be available for subsequent grant under the 2006 Stock Option Plan.
Under the 2006 Stock Option Plan, at no time shall: (i) the number of shares reserved for issuance pursuant to Stock Options granted to any one optionee exceed 10% of the Total
Shares; (ii) the number of shares, together with all security based compensation arrangements of the Company in effect, reserved for issuance pursuant to Stock Options granted
to any "insiders" (as that term is defined under the Securities Act (Ontario)) exceed 10% of the total number of issued and outstanding shares. In addition, the number of shares
issued to insiders pursuant to the exercise of Stock Options, within any one year period, together with all security based compensation arrangements of the Company in effect,
shall not exceed 10% of the total number of issued and outstanding shares.

7.             STOCK BASED COMPENSATION-CONT'D
The purchase price (the “Price”) per share under each Stock Option shall be determined by the board of directors or a committee, as applicable. The Price shall not be lower than
the closing market price on the OTCBB, or another stock exchange where the majority of the trading volume and value of the Shares occurs, on the trading day immediately
preceding the date of grant, or if not so traded, the average between the closing bid and asked prices thereof as reported for the trading day immediately preceding the date of the
grant; provided that if the shares have not traded on the OTCBB or another stock exchange for an extended period of time, the “market price” will be the fair market value of the 
shares at the time of grant, as determined by the board of directors or committee. The board of directors or committee may determine that the Price may escalate at a specified rate
dependent upon the date on which an option may be exercised by the Eligible Participant.
Options shall not be granted for a term exceeding ten years (the “Option Period”).

11.             BANKRUPTCY OF YUKON GOLD CORP.
YGC had material outstanding obligations with its creditors who strongly indicated an unwillingness to settle. As neither YGC nor the Company had an ability to satisfy these
material obligations, on October 6, 2010, the Company’s board of directors resolved to cause YGC to seek relief in a bankruptcy proceeding in Ontario, Canada where YGC was
domiciled.
On November 15, 2010, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, YGC declared bankruptcy with the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy Canada and appointed a trustee 
under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. A Certificate of Appointment, under Section 49 of the Act; Rule 85, was filed in the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy
Canada, in the District of Ontario, Hamilton Division.
Prior to the bankruptcy proceedings, on August 31, 2010, the Company and its subsidiary YGC, entered into a Note Purchase and Security Agreement with Lance Capital Ltd.
(“Lance”)  granting  a  security  interest  of  $375,000  in  settlement  of  certain  payables  of  the  Company  that  had  been  purchased  by  Lance.  The  Note  Purchase  and  Security 
Agreement was registered by Lance against its mineral property (the “Marg Property”) on October 15, 2010. Subsequent to the bankruptcy of YGC, on November 23, 2010,
Lance issued a Notice of Default to the Company and the Trustee in bankruptcy, in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 of the Note Purchase and Security Agreement and
further, in accordance with the provision of Article 6, demanded payment in full of the entire amount of the $375,000 note plus accrued interest. The trustee arranged settlement
of the liability with Lance by way of transfer of title to the Marg Property and as a result YGC lost its interest in the Marg Property. Effective November 15, 2010, the Company’s 
ownership  interests  in  YGC  were  cancelled.  Consequently,  the  results  of  YGC  are  not  included  in  the  results  of  the  Company  subsequent  to  November  15,  2010.  The
deconsolidation of the Canadian subsidiary YGC in November 2010 resulted in the elimination of the accumulated deficit attributable to YGC from Yukon Gold Corporation,
Inc.’s consolidated stockholders’ deficiency and elimination of the accumulated other comprehensive loss on translation during consolidation. Net income of the discontinued 
operation for the nine month period ended January 31, 2011 was comprised of:
Gain on deconsolidation 
Net loss of YGC for the six month period ended October 31, 2010 and to November 15, 2010 
Net income of the discontinued operation

The comparative figures for the year ended April 30, 2010 in the balance sheet have been reclassified in accordance with the current period’s presentation. All balance sheet 
figures of YGC included as part of the consolidation for the year ended April 30, 2010, are included as the discontinued operation. Similarly the comparative figures in the
income statement and in the cash flow statement for the year ended April 30, 2010 have been reclassified in accordance with the current period’s presentation. All prior period 
figures relating to YGC included as part of the consolidation for the year ended April 30, 2010, have been included in the discontinued operation. As a result, the earnings (loss)
per share for the period has been reclassified as earnings (loss) per share from continued operations as well as from the discontinued operation.

12.             FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
FASB defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the
asset or liability in  an orderly  transaction between  market participants on the  measurement  date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize  the use of
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered
observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value, which are the following:
(cid:122) Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
(cid:122) Level 2 - Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are
not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
(cid:122) Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities measured in the balance sheet as of April 30, 2011 are as follows:

Fair value measurements of the Company’s cash are classified under Level 2 because such measurements are determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets.
Fair value measurements of accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and loan from director are classified under Level 3 because inputs are generally unobservable and reflect
management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

13.             SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
a)  Subsequent  to  the  year  ended  April  30,  2011  on  May  16,  2011,  the  Company  merged  into  its  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  a  Nevada  corporation,  (referred  to  herein  as  the 
“Nevada Corporation”) being the surviving entity (the “Merger”). As a result, Yukon Gold Corporation Inc. effected a re-domiciliation from the State of Delaware into the State 
of Nevada. The Nevada Corporation, also named “Yukon Gold Corporation, Inc.”, has authorized capital of 500,000,000 common shares. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger, 
each five (5) shares of the Company’s common stock immediately before the Merger were exchanged for one (1) share of common stock of the Nevada Corporation. As a result,
148,159,936 issued shares of the Company’s common stock were exchanged for 29,632,336 shares of the Nevada Corporation’s common stock. In addition 500,000 warrants and 
500,000 stock options of the Company were exchanged for 100,000 warrants and 100,000 stock options of the Nevada Corporation.
b) Yukon Gold’s shares continue to trade on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol “YGDC”. The Board of Directors and management of Yukon Gold were not changed as a 
result of the merger. All of the assets, rights and liabilities of the Company were assumed by the surviving Nevada Corporation. The Merger was approved by the written consent
of a majority of the Company’s shareholders.
c) Subsequent to the year ended April 30, 2011 Lance Capital Ltd. loaned the Company a total of $40,644 (CDN$39,500) to cover operating costs.

PART I
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which include, without limitation, statements about our explorations, development, efforts to raise capital, expected financial
performance  and  other  aspects  of  our  business  identified  in  this  Annual  Report,  as  well  as  other  reports  that  we  file  from  time  to  time  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission. Any statements about our business, financial results, financial condition and operations contained in this Annual Report that are not statements of historical fact
may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “projects,” or similar expressions 
are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements as a result of 
various factors, including the risk factors described below and elsewhere in this report. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any 
reason, except as required by law, even as new information becomes available or other events occur in the future.
Item 1. Description of Business and Risk Factors
In this report, the terms “Yukon Gold”, “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Yukon Gold Corporation, Inc. The term “common stock” refers to the Company’s common 
stock, par value $0.0001 per share.
Yukon Gold is an exploration stage mining company. Our objective is to acquire, explore and, if warranted and feasible, to develop mineralized material on the mineral claims.
RISK FACTORS
1.
WE HAVE NO WORKING CAPITAL AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND
THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE EXCHANGES ON WHICH OUR SHARES TRADE.
Yukon Gold has no working capital to maintain its ongoing operations, to prepare and file regular reports required to meet the disclosure requirements of the Securities and
Exchange Commission or the Ontario Securities Commission or to meet the requirements of the exchanges on which our stock trades. If we are unable to meet the reporting
requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission we could lose our listing on the OTC Bulletin Board and the shareholders could lose their entire investment.
2.
GOING CONCERN QUALIFICATION.
The Company has included a “going concern” qualification in the accompanying audited financial statements to the effect that we are an exploration stage mining company and 
have no established sources of revenue. In the event that we are unable to raise additional capital, acquire new mineral properties and locate mineral resources, as to which in each
case there can be no assurance, we may not be able to continue our operations. In addition, the existence of the “going concern” qualification in our auditor’s report may make it 
more difficult for us to obtain additional financing. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, you may lose all or part of your investment.
3.
WE MAY HAVE TO PURCHASE NEW MINERAL PROPERTIES TO SECURE FINANCING AND REMAIN VIABLE.
Yukon Gold must immediately secure additional financing to remain viable. Management of Yukon Gold believes that we must identify and purchase new mineral properties in
order to obtain such financing.
1
4.
WE DO NOT HAVE AN OPERATING BUSINESS.
We do not have a mineral property or a mine or a mining business of any kind at this time. We have lost our primary claim asset, known as the Marg Property, as these claims,
previously owned by our wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary Yukon Gold Corp. (“YGC”), were lost when, on November 15, 2010 YGC declared bankruptcy. As a result of the
bankruptcy of YGC, the Company no longer has an interest in the Marg Property.
5.
WE  HAVE  NO  SOURCE  OF  OPERATING  REVENUE  AND  EXPECT  TO  INCUR  SIGNIFICANT  EXPENSES  BEFORE  ESTABLISHING  AN  OPERATING
COMPANY, IF WE ARE ABLE TO ESTABLISH AN OPERATING COMPANY AT ALL.
Currently, we have no source of revenue, we do not have working capital and we do not have any commitments to obtain additional financing. We have no operating history upon
which an evaluation of our future success or failure can be made. Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon:
(cid:123) our ability to acquire new mineral properties that may make our business more attractive to investors in exploration stage mining companies.
(cid:123) our ability to raise capital to develop any new mineral properties, establish a mining operation, and operate the mine in a profitable manner.
Failure to raise the necessary capital to continue exploration and development could cause us to go out of business.
6.
THERE ARE PENNY STOCK SECURITIES LAW CONSIDERATIONS THAT COULD LIMIT YOUR ABILITY TO SELL YOUR SHARES.
Our common stock is considered a "penny stock" and the sale of our stock by you will be subject to the "penny stock rules" of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
penny stock rules require broker-dealers to take steps before making any penny stock trades in customer accounts. As a result, our shares could be illiquid and there could be
delays in the trading of our stock which would negatively affect your ability to sell your shares and could negatively affect the trading price of your shares.
7.
OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO CURRENCY RISKS.
The Company conducts some of its business activities in Canadian dollars. Consequently, the Company is subject to gains or losses due to fluctuations in Canadian currency
relative to the US dollar.
Item 2. Description of Property
The Company and its subsidiary Yukon Gold Corp. (“YGC”), on August 31, 2010, entered into a Note Purchase and Security Agreement with Lance granting a security interest
of $375,000 which was registered against the Marg Property on October 15, 2010. The Company also credited the Company’s wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary, YGC with an 
equal amount from the amount owed to the Company. On November 15, 2010 YGC declared bankruptcy. As a result of the bankruptcy of YGC, the Company no longer has an
interest in the Marg Property.

pertaining to a dispute regarding legal fees allegedly owed to Sheldon by the Company’s wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary, Yukon Gold Corp. Management believes this suit is 
without merit and the Company has filed a defense against the suit and will continue to vigorously defend against it.

Nevada. The Nevada Corporation, also named “Yukon Gold Corporation, Inc.”, has authorized capital of 500,000,000 common shares. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger, each
five (5) shares of the Company’s common stock immediately before the Merger were exchanged for one (1) share of common stock of the Nevada Corporation. As a result, 
148,159,936 issued shares of the Company’s common stock were exchanged for 29,632,336 shares of the Nevada Corporation’s common stock. The par value of the Company 
common shares remains at $0.0001 per share. All references to common shares and per common share amounts have been retroactively adjusted from the date of inception to

Dividends
We have not declared any cash dividends on our common stock. We plan to retain any future earnings, if any, for exploration programs, administrative expenses and development

Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans
On October 28, 2003, we adopted the 2003 Stock Option Plan (the "2003 Plan") under which our officers, directors, consultants, advisors and employees may receive stock
options. The aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2003 Plan is 5,000,000. Options granted under the 2003 Plan were either "incentive stock
options", intended to qualify as such under the provisions of section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as from time to time amended (the "Code") or "unqualified stock
options". The 2003 Plan was administered by the Board of Directors.
On May 23, 2005, Yukon Gold filed a registration statement on Form S-8 with the SEC pursuant to which it registered 3,300,000 of the 5,000,000 shares of common stock
reserved for issuance upon exercise of options granted pursuant to the 2003 Plan. On February 10, 2006 the board of directors adopted a policy of not accepting promissory notes
from option holders as payment for the exercise of options. On January 19, 2007, the shareholders of the Company approved, subject to regulatory approval, the extension of
2,064,000 options held by all current officers, directors, consultants and employees in the 2003 Stock Option Plan. The Company cannot issue any further options under the 2003
Plan. As of December 13, 2010 there were no longer any options reserved to be granted under the 2003 Plan.
The Company adopted a new Stock Option Plan at its shareholders meeting on January 19, 2007 (the “2006 Stock Option Plan”). The purpose of the 2006 Stock Option Plan is to 
develop and increase the interest of certain Eligible Participants (as defined below) in the growth and development of the Company by providing them with the opportunity to
acquire a proprietary interest in the Company through the grant of options ("Stock Options") to acquire Shares.
Under  the  2006  Stock  Option  Plan,  Stock  Options  may  be  granted  to  Eligible  Participants  or  to  any  registered  savings  plan  established  for  the  sole  benefit  of  an  Eligible
Participant or any company which, during the term of an option, is wholly-owned by an Eligible Participant. The term “Eligible Participant” includes directors, senior officers and 
employees of the Company or an Affiliated Entity (as defined below) and any person engaged to provide services under a written contract for an initial, renewable or extended
period of twelve months or more (a “Consultant”), other than services provided in relation to a distribution of securities, who spends or will spend a significant amount of time on 
the business and affairs of the Company and who is knowledgeable about the business and affairs of the Company. An “Affiliated Entity” means a person or company that is 
controlled by the Company.
The 2006 Stock Option Plan is administered by the board of directors of the Company. At the option of the board, it may be administered by a committee appointed by the board
of directors for that purpose.
Upon  adoption  in  2006,  the  aggregate  number  of  Shares  which  could  be  issued  under  the  2006  Stock  Option  Plan  was  limited  to  2,000,000  Shares,  then  representing
approximately 10.63% of the then currently issued and outstanding Shares. On March 18, 2008 at the 2008 Annual and Special Meeting of Shareholders, the shareholders of the
Company approved an amendment to the 2006 Stock Option Plan increasing the number of Shares reserved for issuance thereunder from 2,000,000 to 2,899,044, representing
approximately 10% of the then issued and outstanding Shares. The 2006 Stock Option Plan was also amended to include a provision requiring shareholder approval for any future
increase in the maximum number of Shares reserved for issuance thereunder.
Any Stock Option granted under the 2006 Stock Option Plan which has been exercised shall again be available for subsequent grant under the 2006 Stock Option Plan, effectively
resulting in a re-loading of the number of Shares available for grant under the 2006 Stock Option Plan.
Any Shares subject to an option granted under the 2006 Stock Option Plan which for any reason is surrendered, cancelled or terminated or expires without having been exercised
shall again be available for subsequent grant under the 2006 Stock Option Plan.

Subsequent  to  the  year  ended  April  30,  2011  on  May  16,  2011,  Yukon  Gold  merged  into  its  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  a  Nevada  corporation,  with  the  Nevada  corporation 
(referred  to  herein  as  the  “Nevada  Corporation”)  being  the  surviving  entity  (the  “Merger”).  For  more  information  regarding  the re-domiciliation  see  Item  7  “Management’s 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” herein.

This section should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited financial statements and notes included in this report.

Discussion of Operations & Financial Condition Twelve months ended April 30, 2011
Yukon Gold has no source of revenue and we continue to operate at a loss. We expect our operating losses to continue for so long as we remain in an exploration stage and
perhaps thereafter. As at April 30, 2011, we had accumulated losses of $15,235,900. These losses raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our
ability to emerge from the exploration stage and conduct mining operations is dependent, in large part, upon our raising additional equity financing.
As described in greater detail below, the Company’s major endeavor over the year has been its effort to raise additional capital to meet its administrative expenses and pursue its 
exploration activities. The Company does not currently have any working capital to continue as a reporting company in the United States and Canada. We are working urgently
working to obtain additional financing, which may entail the acquisition of new properties in order to attract such financing.

The total assets for the year ended April 30, 2011 includes cash of $29,849, prepaid expenses and other receivables of $3,195 and equipment of $25,500. The total assets for the
year ended April 30, 2010 included cash of $573, and assets of the discontinued operation which are comprised of cash of $960 and prepaid expenses and other receivables of
$12,748 and equipment of $27,868.
Revenues
No revenue was generated by the Company’s operations during the years ended April 30, 2011 and April 30, 2010.
Net Loss
The  Company’s  expenses  are  reflected  in  the  Statements  of  Operations  under  the  category  of  Operating  Expenses.  To  meet  the  criteria  of  United  States  generally  accepted
accounting principles (“GAAP”), all general and administrative costs related to projects are charged to operations in the year incurred.
The significant components of expense that have contributed to the total operating expense are discussed as follows:
(a) General and Administrative Expense
Included in operating expenses for the year ended April 30, 2011 is general and administrative expense of $312,795, as compared with $318,279 for the year ended April 30,
2010. General and administrative expense represents a majority of the total operating expense for the year ended April 30, 2011 and for the year ended April 30, 2010. General
and administrative expense decreased by $5,484 in the current year, compared to the prior year. The decrease in this expense is mainly due to decrease in overall administrative
expenses by management.

BANKRUPTCY OF YUKON GOLD CORP.
During  the  quarter  ended  January  31,  2011,  the  efforts  of  Lance,  to  settle or  acquire  all  of  the  debts of the  Company’s  wholly-owned  Canadian  subsidiary,  YGC, were  not
successful. YGC had material outstanding obligations with its creditors who strongly indicated an unwillingness to settle. As neither YGC nor the Company had an ability to
satisfy these material obligations, on October 6, 2010, the Company’s board of directors resolved to cause YGC to seek relief in a bankruptcy proceeding in Ontario, Canada
where YGC was domiciled. On November 15, 2010, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, YGC declared bankruptcy with the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy
Canada and appointed a trustee under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. A Certificate of Appointment, under Section 49 of the Act; Rule 85, was filed in the Office of the
Superintendent of Bankruptcy Canada, in the District of Ontario, Hamilton Division.
On  August  31,  2010,  the  Company  and  its  subsidiary  YGC,  entered  into  a  Note  Purchase  and  Security  Agreement  with  Lance  granting  a  security  interest  of  $375,000  in
settlement  of  certain  payables  of  the  Company  that  had  been  purchased  by  Lance.  The  Note  Purchase  and  Security  Agreement  was  registered  by  Lance  against  its  mineral
property (the “Marg Property”) on October 15, 2010. Subsequent to the bankruptcy of YGC, on November 23, 2010, Lance issued a Notice of Default to the Company and the
Trustee in bankruptcy, in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 of the Note Purchase and Security Agreement and further, in accordance with the provision of Article 6,
demanded payment in full of the entire amount of the $375,000 note plus accrued interest. The trustee arranged settlement of the liability with Lance by way of transfer of title to
the  Marg  Property  and  as  a  result  YGC  lost  its  interest  in  the  Marg  Property.  Effective  November  15,  2010,  the  Company’s  ownership  interests  in  YGC  were  cancelled. 
Consequently, the results of YGC are not included in the results of the Company subsequent to November 15, 2010. The deconsolidation of the Canadian subsidiary YGC in
November  2010  resulted  in  the  elimination  of  the  accumulated  deficit  attributable  to  YGC  from  Yukon  Gold  Corporation,  Inc.’s  consolidated  stockholders’  deficiency  and 
elimination of the accumulated other comprehensive loss on translation during consolidation. Net income of the discontinued operation was comprised of:

The comparative figures for the year ended April 30, 2010 in the balance sheet have been reclassified in accordance with the current period’s presentation. All balance sheet 
figures of YGC included as part of the consolidation for the year ended April 30, 2010, are included as the discontinued operation.
Similarly the comparative figures in the income statement and in the cash flow statement for the year ended April 30, 2010 have been reclassified in accordance with the current
period’s presentation. All prior period figures relating to YGC included as part of the consolidation for the year ended April 30, 2010, have been included in the discontinued 
operation. As a result, the earnings (loss) per share for the period has been reclassified as earnings (loss) per share from continued operations as well as from the discontinued
operation.

are incurred substantially in accordance with monthly and annual budgets to be prepared by Lance and approved by the Board of Directors of the Company from time to time.
The term of this Agreement is one (1) year and automatically renews from year to year unless terminated upon 30 days prior written notice by either party.
Subsequent Events
a) RE-DOMICILIATION
Subsequent to the year ended April 30, 2011 on May 16, 2011, the Company merged into its wholly-owned subsidiary, a Nevada corporation, (referred to herein as the “Nevada 
Corporation”)  being  the  surviving  entity  (the  “Merger”).  As  a  result,  Yukon  Gold  Corporation  Inc.  effected  a  re-domiciliation  from  the  State  of  Delaware  into  the  State  of 
Nevada. The Nevada Corporation, also named “Yukon Gold Corporation, Inc.”, has authorized capital of 500,000,000 common shares. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger, each
five (5) shares of the Company’s common stock immediately before the Merger were exchanged for one (1) share of common stock of the Nevada Corporation. As a result, 
148,159,936 issued shares of the Company’s common stock were exchanged for 29,632,336 shares of the Nevada Corporation’s common stock. In addition 500,000 warrants and 
500,000 stock options of the Company were exchanged for 100,000 warrants and 100,000 stock options of the Nevada Corporation.
b) Yukon Gold’s shares continue to trade on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol “YGDC”. The Board of Directors and management of Yukon Gold were not changed as a 
result of the merger. All of the assets, rights and liabilities of the Company were assumed by the surviving Nevada Corporation. The Merger was approved by the written consent
of a majority of the Company’s shareholders.
c) Subsequent to the year ended April 30, 2011 Lance Capital Ltd. loaned the Company a total of $40,644 (CDN$39,500) to cover operating costs.

Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance
On May 1, 2010, the Company adopted FASB ASU 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASU 2010-06). ASU 2010-06 updates FASB ASC 820, Fair Value 
Measurements. ASU 2010-06 requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements including transfers in and out of levels 1 and 2 and a higher level of disaggregation 
for the different types of financial instruments. There was no material impact on the Company’s financial statements related to the adoption of this guidance.
Business Combinations: In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-29, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for
Business  Combinations.”  The  new  guidance  specifies  that  when  comparative  financial  statements  are  presented,  the  revenue  and  earnings  of  the  combined  entity  should  be
disclosed as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. The
new guidance applies prospectively to us for business combinations which occur on or after may 1, 2011. The impact of these new provisions on our consolidated financial
statements will depend upon the nature, terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate in the future. 
 
Fair Value: In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure 
Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs.” The new guidance does not extend the use of fair value accounting, but provides guidance on how it should be applied where its use is
already required or permitted by other standards within GASP or International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”). The new guidance also changes the working used to 
describe  many  requirements  in  GAAP  for  measuring  fair  value  and  for  disclosing  information  about  fair  value  measurements  and  it  clarifies  the  FASB’s  intent  about  the 
application of existing fair value measurements. The new guidance applies prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We
will adopt the provisions of this new guidance on January 1, 2012. We do not expect the adoption of the new provisions to have a material impact on our financial condition or
results of operations. 
 
Comprehensive Income:  In June 2011, the  FASB issued  ASU 2011-05,  “Comprehensive  Income (Topic  220): Presentation  of Comprehensive Income.”  The new guidance 
requires that all non-owner changes in stockholders’ equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive 
statements. In both cases, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a
total  for  other  comprehensive  income,  and  a  total  amount  for  comprehensive  income.  If  presented  in  a  single  continuous  statement,  the  entity  is  required  to  present  the
components of net income and total net income, the components of other comprehensive income and a total for other comprehensive income, along with a total of comprehensive
income in that statement. If presented in the two-statement approach, the first statement which is the statement of net income, should present components of net income and total 
net income followed consecutively by a second statement which is the statement of other comprehensive income, that should present the components of other comprehensive
income, total other comprehensive income and a total amount for comprehensive income. Regardless of the method used, the entity if required to present on the face of the
financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement where the components of net
income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented. The new guidance is effective retrospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2011. We will adopt the provisions of this new guidance on January 1, 2012. We do not expect the adoption of the new provisions to have a
material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 
 
Critical Accounting Policies
The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America,  requires  us  to  make  estimates  and
assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period
and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, particularly those related to the determination of the
accrued liabilities. To the extent actual results differ from those estimates; our future results of operations may be affected.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk
As a “smaller reporting company”, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
See the financial statements and report of Schwartz Levitsky Feldman, LLP contained in this report.
Item 9. Change in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company's management, with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively, has 
evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer
of the Company, respectively, have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
(b) Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There have not been any changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-
15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the year ended April 30, 2011 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's 
internal control over financial reporting.
Management's Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Based on an evaluation as of the date of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of
the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-l5(e). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or
submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms.
The  management  of  Yukon  Gold  Corporation,  Inc.  is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  adequate  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  Internal  control  over
financial reporting is defined in Rule I3a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the 
company's principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States and includes those policies and procedures that:
* 
 
*
*
Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
 
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and 
 
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Even those systems determined to be effective can provide
only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material
misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the
financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce this risk.
In making its assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated 
Framework.
13
Inherent  in  small  business  is  the  pervasive  problem  of  segregation  of  duties.  Given  that  the  Company  has  a  small  accounting  department,  segregation  of  duties  cannot  be
completely accomplished at this time. Management has added compensating controls to effectively reduce and minimize the risk of a material misstatement in the Company's
annual or interim financial statements.
Based on its assessment, management concluded that, as of April 30, 2011, the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
Auditor Attestation
This annual report does not include an attestation report of the company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's
report was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the company to
provide only management's report.
Changes in Internal Controls
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended April 30, 2011, that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Board has Assumed Responsibilities of Audit Committee

Item 12. Security Ownership and Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters
The Company has 29,632,336 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as at August 11, 2011. Subsequent to the year ended April 30, 2011 on May 16, 2011, Yukon Gold
merged into its wholly-owned subsidiary, a Nevada corporation, with the Nevada corporation (referred to herein as the “Nevada Corporation”) being the surviving entity (the 
“Merger”).  As  a  result,  Yukon  Gold  effected  a  re-domiciliation  from  the  State  of  Delaware  into  the  State  of  Nevada.  The  Nevada  Corporation,  also  named  “Yukon  Gold 
Corporation, Inc.”, has authorized capital of 500,000,000 common shares. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger, each five (5) shares of the Company’s common stock immediately 
before the Merger were exchanged for one (1) share of common stock of the Nevada Corporation As a result, 148,159,936 issued shares of the Company’s common stock were 
exchanged for  29,632,336 shares  of the Nevada Corporation’s common  stock. In  addition  500,000 warrants  and  500,000  stock options of  the Company  were  exchanged for 
100,000 warrants and 100,000 stock options of the Nevada Corporation.
Yukon Gold’s shares continue to trade on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol “YGDC”. The Board of Directors and management of Yukon Gold were not changed as a 
result of the merger. All of the assets, rights and liabilities of the Company were assumed by the surviving Nevada Corporation. The Merger was approved by the written consent
of a majority of the Company’s shareholders.
Consequently, for purposes of describing shareholder voting rights, we have included in the table below the number of common shares of Yukon Gold Corporation, Inc. (Yukon
Gold) held by the officers and directors of the Company. The last column of the table below reflects the voting rights of each officer and/or director as a percentage of the total
voting shares (common shares of Yukon Gold) as of August 11, 2011.
