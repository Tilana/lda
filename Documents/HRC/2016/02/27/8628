<p><b>2</b> 
</p>
<p><b>  Advice of the Office of Legal Counsel on the establishment of 
an escrow fund pursuant to Human Rights Council 
resolution 13/9 
</b></p>
<p>1. In response to the request of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights for advice with regard to the establishment of an escrow fund, the Office of Legal 
Affairs identified a number of decisions that would need to be taken by a competent organ 
of the United Nations (for example the General Assembly) if the decision were to be made 
to follow the recommendation made in the Goldstone report.1 These would include (a) a 
decision to establish the escrow fund; (b) a decision on the source(s) of funding for the 
fund; (c) a decision to establish a body to administer the fund; (d) a decision on the extent 
to which the body would rely on the investigations carried out by the Government of Israel 
and the Palestinian authorities in order to determine the factual basis of a claim for 
compensation from the fund; and (e) a decision to establish a secretariat of the body 
administering the fund.  
</p>
<p>2. The Office of Legal Affairs furthermore identified a set of ancillary decisions that 
would also need to be taken, including decisions on the identification of persons eligible to 
receive compensation from the fund; the particular types of loss for which compensation 
might be paid from the fund; the process for the submission of claims for compensation; a 
timetable for the submission of claims; and a target date for the completion of claims 
processing.
