Agenda item 3 
<b>Promotion and protection of all human rights, civil,  
political, economic, social and cultural rights, 
including the right to development</b> 
</p>
<p><b>  Report of the Independent Expert on the question of human 
rights and extreme poverty, Magdalena Sep&#250;lveda Carmona 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i>In the present report, the Independent Expert sets out the parameters of a human 
</p>
<p>rights-based approach to recovery from the global economic and financial crises, with a 
particular focus on the most vulnerable and marginalized groups. She urges States to see 
recovery from the crises as an opportunity for change, a chance to rectify deeply 
ingrained poverty and social exclusion, restore social cohesion and lay the foundations 
for more equitable, sustainable societies.   
</p>
<p>The Independent Expert first identifies the human rights framework that States 
must comply with when designing recovery measures. She notes that, while States have 
discretion to adopt policy measures according to their own context, human rights are not 
dispensable during times of economic hardship, and States must design and implement 
all policies according to their human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p> The Independent Expert analyses a number of recovery measures from a human 
rights perspective, highlighting their potential to threaten the enjoyment of economic, 
social and cultural rights. She then recommends measures that States should consider 
taking to facilitate a human rights-based recovery from the crises. These innovative 
measures will assist States in moving as effectively and efficiently as possible towards 
the full realization of economic, social and cultural rights. By adopting policies that have 
at their heart the realization of human rights, States can ensure a swifter, more 
sustainable and inclusive recovery.

<p><b> I. Activities undertaken by the mandate holder 
</b></p>
<p>1. The current report is submitted by the Independent Expert on the question of human 
rights and extreme poverty, Magdalena Sep&#250;lveda Carmona, in accordance with Human 
Rights Council resolution 8/11. The report reflects the Expert&#8217;s work in analysing the 
impact of recovery measures on the human rights of those living in extreme poverty.  
</p>
<p>2. Since her previous annual report (A/HRC/14/31), the Independent Expert has 
submitted a report to the General Assembly (A/65/259), in which she highlighted the 
importance of social protection measures in facilitating the achievement of the Millennium 
Development Goals. The report made recommendations on the core elements of a rights-
based social protection system, including the meaningful integration of gender-related 
concerns. To prepare the report, the Expert convened a meeting, in collaboration with the 
Center for Women&#8217;s Global Leadership, which brought together experts from all regions. 
She also distributed a questionnaire to gather and analyse States&#8217; experiences and good 
practices.  
</p>
<p>3. At the fifteenth session of the Human Rights Council, the Independent expert 
presented the report on her joint mission to Bangladesh with the Independent Expert on the 
issue of human rights obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation 
(A/HRC/15/55). Additionally, in accordance with Council resolution 12/19, the 
Independent Expert submitted a progress report (A/HRC/15/41) with detailed 
recommendations on how to improve the draft guiding principles on extreme poverty and 
human rights. In order to prepare the report, the Expert convened a meeting in May 2010, in 
collaboration with Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung, which was attended by experts working on 
human rights and development issues worldwide. She also consulted with various 
stakeholders and participated in two meetings with non-governmental organizations 
promoted by ATD-Quart Monde, and a meeting with human rights and development 
practitioners at Brandeis University.  
</p>
<p>4. During the current reporting cycle, the Independent Expert also visited Viet Nam 
(August 2010) and Ireland (January 2011). The Expert takes this opportunity to thank both 
Governments for the active support they provided to the missions. 
</p>
<p>5. In June 2010, the Independent Expert participated in the Latin American Regional 
Consultation on the draft general guidelines on foreign debt and human rights. In December 
2010, she took part in the third Forum on Minority Issues. Additionally, during the 
reporting period, the expert participated in numerous events and held working meetings 
with Governments, United Nations agencies, the World Bank, donor agencies, academic 
institutions, non-governmental organizations and representatives of people living in 
poverty. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>6. Since the onset of the global economic and financial crises, the Independent Expert 
has been committed to raising awareness about and conducting an analysis of the impact of 
the crises on the enjoyment of human rights by the most marginalized and excluded 
members of society who, despite being removed from the causes of the crises, have 
suffered disproportionately from them. In this regard, the Expert participated in the tenth 
special session of the Human Rights Council on the theme &#8220;The impact of the global 
economic and financial crises on the universal realisation and effective enjoyment of 
human rights&#8221;. She also submitted a written contribution to the United Nations Conference 
on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development in June 2009. </p>


<p>In the report that the Expert submitted to the General Assembly in October 2009 
(A/64/279), she addressed the impact of the crises on people living in extreme poverty and 
their enjoyment of human rights. 
</p>
<p>7. The present report continues the Independent Expert&#8217;s previous work by focusing on 
the human rights challenges and opportunities inherent in building a sustainable recovery 
from the crises. She seeks to approach the prospect of recovery as a unique opportunity for 
transformation and enhanced protection of human rights. States are encouraged to take 
stock of the effect of successive crises and to formulate a vision for recovery based on the 
realization of universally accepted human rights standards. In the report, she asks whether 
the recovery measures currently pursued by States are adequate to protect the most 
vulnerable and ensure the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights by all 
individuals. Lastly, she highlights the need for human rights-based approaches to recovery 
in order to rectify the deterioration in the enjoyment of human rights caused by the crises 
and to lay the foundations for a more equitable and inclusive society.  
</p>
<p>8. In order to prepare the report, the Independent Expert addressed a questionnaire to 
Governments requesting information on their policy responses to the global economic and 
financial crises and their proposed recovery measures. As at 28 February 2011, 24 
Governments had responded.1  
</p>
<p>9. The Independent Expert also benefited from a review of many studies on the impact 
of the crises and recovery measures, and from an expert meeting convened by the Expert 
and organized by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 
with the support of the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) and the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs of Norway, on 27 and 28 January 2011. A total of 18 experts from 
Governments, non-governmental organizations, United Nations agencies and academic 
institutions attended the meeting and contributed to the Expert&#8217;s examination of the issues. 
</p>
<p>10. The Independent Expert wishes to express her gratitude to all States that submitted 
information and to the experts, non-governmental organizations and United Nations 
agencies that supported this process and assisted in the preparation of the present report. 
The Expert is particularly grateful for the support and guidance of UNICEF, which has also 
been working extensively on issues relating to recovery from the global economic and 
financial crises.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Human rights framework 
</b></p>
<p>11. International human rights law stipulates concrete obligations to ensure the 
realization of economic, social and cultural rights. These obligations are enshrined in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in a number of human rights treaties at the 
regional and universal levels. The most direct obligations are those set forth in the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, with which 160 States 
must comply.2 Several other treaties also establish compulsory obligations regarding 
economic, social and cultural rights, such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the 
</p>
<p>  
 1  Questionnaire responses were received from Algeria, Argentina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cuba, 
</p>
<p>Estonia, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Indonesia, Jordan, Lithuania, Montenegro, Morocco, 
Myanmar, Nicaragua, Norway, Portugal, the Republic of Moldova, Spain, the Syrian Arab Republic, 
Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. All 
responses are available from http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/poverty/expert/index.htm. 
</p>
<p> 2  As at 28 February 2011. </p>


<p>International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, among others. These international 
treaties, in conjunction with a great number of universally agreed declarations and soft law 
instruments, determine the legal framework that States must comply with at the domestic 
level, even in time of crisis. The Expert&#8217;s evaluation in the present report is based 
primarily, but not exclusively, on the obligations enshrined in the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>12. Even when resources are limited, States are legally bound to respect, protect and 
fulfil international human rights obligations. For State parties to the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, this means, for example, that they must dedicate 
the maximum amount of resources available to progressively achieve the full realization of 
all economic, social and cultural rights. The human rights perspective distinguishes 
between the inability and the simple unwillingness to act.3 States cannot use the economic 
damage caused by the crises to justify actions or omissions that amount to violations of 
basic human rights obligations. While economic, social and cultural rights are often subject 
to the principle of &#8220;progressive realization&#8221; depending on the availability of resources in 
each State, this principle also prescribes particular modes of conduct that are compulsory 
for all States, regardless of their level of development. These obligations considerably limit 
the discretion of States with regard to the implementation of economic, social and cultural 
rights, and require immediate action. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Using the maximum resources available 
</b></p>
<p>13. States must devote the maximum available resources to ensure the progressive 
realization of all economic, social and cultural rights as expeditiously and effectively as 
possible. In its general comment No. 3, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights stated that this is so even during times of severe resources constraints, whether 
caused by a process of adjustment, economic recession, or by other factors. This obligation 
imposes limitations on a State&#8217;s freedom to allocate available resources. The resources 
&#8220;available&#8221; are not only the resources within a State, but also those available from the 
international community through &#8220;international assistance and cooperation&#8221;. States that do 
not possess the necessary resources are obliged to &#8220;actively seek assistance&#8221; to ensure, at 
the very least, minimum essential levels of enjoyment of human rights.4 
</p>
<p>14. While several external factors affect the availability of domestic resources, such as 
the provision of official development assistance (ODA) and the role of international trade, 
compliance with this principle also depends on how the State generates and mobilizes 
resources to fund compliance with human rights obligations. For example, if a State 
generates too little revenue or allocates a high proportion of its budget to defence, its ability 
to provide sufficient levels of public services will be compromised.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Ensuring minimum essential levels of economic, social and cultural 
rights 
</b></p>
<p>15. State parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
have an immediate minimum core obligation to ensure the satisfaction of, at the very least, 
</p>
<p>  
 3  Maastricht Guidelines on Violations of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, para. 13. 
 4  Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comments No. 4, para. 10, No. 5, para. 
</p>
<p>13 and No. 11, para. 11. </p>


<p>minimum essential levels of all economic, social and cultural rights.5 These minimum 
essential levels are those which are crucial to securing an adequate standard of living 
through basic subsistence, essential primary health care, basic shelter and housing, and 
basic forms of education for all members of society.  
</p>
<p>16. The obligation to achieve these minimum essential obligations is not dispensed with 
during times of crisis and recovery. Even during times of severe resource constraints, when 
available resources are demonstrably inadequate, the obligation remains for States to 
demonstrate that every effort has been made to use all resources that are at its disposal, in 
an effort to satisfy, as matter of priority, minimum essential levels and to protect the most 
disadvantaged and marginalized members or groups of society by adopting relatively low-
cost targeted programmes.6 
</p>
<p>17. In the context of recovery from successive crises, this principle obliges States to 
ensure that any programmes or policies that are integral to delivering essential services (for 
example, primary education, basic health care and social assistance programmes) are 
protected, to the greatest extent possible, from reduced expenditure. The duty of the State to 
prioritize the rights of the poorest and most vulnerable people does not imply that the State 
may adopt a very narrow approach. States continue to have responsibilities to move as 
expeditiously and effectively as possible towards the widest possible enjoyment of rights by 
all, which means maintaining services beyond a basic level.7  
</p>
<p><b> C. Avoiding deliberately retrogressive measures 
</b></p>
<p>18. There is a strong presumption that deliberately retrogressive measures that affect the 
level of enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights are in violation of human rights 
standards.8 Examples of retrogressive measures might include the adoption of policy or 
legislation with a direct or collateral negative effect on the enjoyment of rights by 
individuals, or unjustified reductions in expenditures devoted to implementing public 
services that are critical for the realization of economic, social and cultural rights, such as 
those which guarantee basic health care, ensure access to primary education, or make 
available assistance for food and shelter. 
</p>
<p>19. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights noted that, in adopting 
retrogressive measures, States must demonstrate that they have been introduced after the 
most careful consideration of all alternatives and that they are duly justified by reference to 
the totality of the rights provided for in the Covenant, in the context of the full use of the 
maximum available resources.9  
</p>
<p>20. If a State uses &#8220;resource constraints&#8221; as an explanation for any retrogressive 
measure, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights will assess the situation 
considering, inter alia, the country&#8217;s level of development, the severity of the breach, 
whether the situation concerned the enjoyment of the minimum core content and whether 
the State had identified low-cost options, or had sought international assistance.10

<p><b> D. Ensuring non-discrimination and equality 
</b></p>
<p>21. The requirement that a State must ensure enjoyment of human rights equally and 
without discrimination of any kind is a fundamental pillar of the human rights framework.11 
The scarcity of resources in times of economic hardship is not an acceptable justification 
for discriminatory measures or failing to implement anti-discrimination policies.  
</p>
<p>22. Expenditure and entitlements must benefit all social groups equally, and exclusions 
from public funds based on, for example, citizenship or employment status, may violate the 
requirement for non-discrimination. These principles also require States to identify 
vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in society and to protect them as a matter of priority. 
States have an obligation to take special and positive measures to diminish or eliminate 
conditions that cause or help to perpetrate discrimination.12 
</p>
<p>23. Given the clearly disproportionate and devastating effect of the global economic and 
financial crises on vulnerable and disadvantaged groups, including children, persons with 
disabilities, older persons, indigenous peoples, ethnic minorities and migrants, States must 
be particularly careful to ensure that recovery measures do not exclude them or exacerbate 
their situation. Considering that gender inequality is a cause of and a factor that perpetuates 
poverty, effective recovery policies must take into account State obligations regarding 
gender equality and the protection of women&#8217;s full range of rights. 
</p>
<p>24. When limited resources require the adoption of targeted measures to reach the 
poorest and most disadvantaged members and groups in society, caution is required from a 
human rights perspective. In principle, human rights standards are not compromised by the 
use of targeted schemes as a form of prioritization of the most vulnerable and 
disadvantaged groups. However, States must ensure that targeting mechanisms comply with 
human rights standards and are utilized only within a longer-term strategy of progressively 
ensuring universal protection. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Allowing for participation, transparency and accountability 
</b></p>
<p>25. At the core of the human rights framework is an overarching requirement that all 
States take into consideration the principles of participation, transparency and 
accountability in the design, implementation and evaluation of State policies.13 Human 
rights are important not only in the outcome of State policies but also in the process by 
which they are formulated and implemented. These principles are integral both to ensuring 
effectiveness in the adopted policy and responding to the obligations of States with regard 
to the rights to take part in public life, to seek and receive information and to have access to 
effective remedies in cases of violation.  
</p>
<p>26. In formulating policies in response to the crises, such as reductions in public 
expenditure, increases in taxation or entering into conditional loans with donors or financial 
institutions, States must allow for the broadest possible national dialogue, with effective 
</p>
<p>  
 11  See for example International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, arts. 2(2) and 3; 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, arts. 2(1), 3 and 26; International Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, art. 2(1); Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women, art. 2; and Convention on the Rights of the Child, art. 
2(1).  
</p>
<p> 12  See for example Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, art. 
4(1) and International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, art. 2(2). 
</p>
<p> 13  For further information on how to operationalize these principles, see the previous reports of the 
mandate holder.  </p>


<p>and meaningful participation of civil society, including those who will be directly affected 
by such policies. 
</p>
<p>27. To allow the public to participate democratically in discussions and decision-
making, information about proposed policy measures must be disseminated widely and in a 
way that is easily understood. Participatory mechanisms should be established and the 
capacity of rights-holders to know their rights must be strengthened. 
</p>
<p>28. Governments should encourage independent organizations and academic institutions 
to develop alternative policy options and to carry out assessments of the social impact of all 
options and proposed measures. Recovery measures should also be open to oversight, 
including judicial scrutiny, and public officials involved in economic policy should be 
accountable for any policy decisions that endanger the enjoyment of human rights.   
</p>
<p><b> IV. Addressing the needs of the most vulnerable to ensure an 
inclusive, rights-based recovery 
</b></p>
<p>29. Since the global economic and financial crises in the financial markets arose in 
2007, they have had a devastating impact on poverty rates and presented a serious threat to 
the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people across the globe. Their 
disastrous impact has been amplified by a number of pre-existing social and economic 
realities: the world had been plagued in preceding years by consecutive fuel and food 
crises, unemployment was already unacceptably high, a majority of workers were employed 
in the informal sector, and only 20 per cent of the world&#8217;s working-age population and their 
families had effective access to social protection.14  
</p>
<p>30. The onset of the global economic and financial crises therefore exacerbated 
deprivations and resulted in inequality and poverty becoming not only more widespread, 
but more deeply entrenched. According to World Bank estimates, as a result of the crises, 
an additional 50 million people fell into income poverty (less than $1.25 a day) during 2009 
and an estimated 64 million more were living in income poverty by the end of 2010. 
Around 71 million additional people will remain in extreme poverty until 2020 than 
otherwise would have.15  
</p>
<p>31. The advanced interconnectedness of the world&#8217;s economies and markets means that 
the ramifications of the crises have been far more extensive than any previous comparable 
economic downturn. Throughout both developing and developed countries, 205 million 
people are unemployed16 the highest number of unemployed in history. As a result of the 
crises, at least 55,000 more children are likely to die each year from 2009 to 2015.17 The 
prevalence of children dropping out of school has increased, as boys have been propelled 
into the workforce and girls given an increased burden of household tasks.18  By 2009, at

<p>least 100 million more people were hungry and undernourished because of the crises,19 a 
situation that continues to deteriorate owing to escalating food prices. 
</p>
<p>32. These are alarming numbers. What these figures do not show, however, is that those 
who are enduring the gravest effects of the crises are the most vulnerable and 
disadvantaged in society, including women, children, older persons, persons with 
disabilities, indigenous peoples, ethnic minorities and migrants. Because of ingrained 
discrimination and structural disadvantage, vulnerable groups have restricted access to 
services and social protection, which help to cushion the effects of crises, and they are thus 
exposed to increased risk during times of economic shock.  
</p>
<p>33. The above-mentioned groups have suffered and continue to suffer the cumulative 
effects of previous crises and are in an increasingly weak and vulnerable situation. They 
have exhausted their coping mechanisms, such as eating fewer meals, cutting health 
expenditures, taking their children out of school and increasing working hours in the 
informal sector, and are left with very limited capacity for resilience. Their situation is 
further compounded by the current spike in food prices, which is forcing those living in 
poverty to buy even less expensive and less nutritious food.  
</p>
<p>34. To overcome the impact of economic deprivation and social exclusion, members of 
such groups require specific initiatives aimed at addressing their vulnerabilities and risks. 
Those living in poverty are the least equipped to benefit from the measures taken by States 
to respond to the crises. States must take measures that explicitly address those living in 
poverty, otherwise recovery measures will not reach them and inequality will become 
further entrenched. States should not presume that the recovery will simply &#8220;trickle down&#8221; 
to the most vulnerable. To ensure an inclusive rights-based recovery, States and the 
international community must address the specific needs of the poorest and most 
disadvantaged as a matter of great urgency. Failure to do this will imply lasting harm to 
those living in poverty. 
</p>
<p>35. The ways in which States have sought to respond to the global economic and 
financial crises have differed markedly across the globe, although some trends in crisis 
responses were clear. When the crisis first emerged, a large number of States introduced 
counter-cyclical measures (such as fiscal stimulus packages and social protection 
interventions) as a means of responding effectively and mitigating some of the most severe 
effects on the enjoyment of human rights by those living in poverty. While counter-cyclical 
measures proved to be crucial to protect the poorest, however, the fear is now that a number 
of States are discontinuing their counter-cyclical policies, retreating from fiscal stimulus 
plans and adopting fiscal austerity measures that reduce public expenditure, including 
social protection interventions.20  
</p>
<p>36. Reductions in public expenditure are likely to take the form of decreased spending 
on social services,21 which has the potential to significantly undermine the effective and 
efficient functioning of basic health and education services and social protection systems. 
These services are crucial for providing minimum essential levels of enjoyment of human 
rights and to protect the rights of the poorest and most vulnerable members of society. 
While the human rights framework does not exclude the possibility of States adopting

<p>austerity measures, it is clear that, in many instances, these reductions in expenditure could 
have grave consequences for the enjoyment of human rights, particularly for those living in 
poverty who continue to suffer from the cumulative effects of the crises.  
</p>
<p>37. Human rights do not dictate what policy measures States should take. States have 
the discretion to select and take policy measures according to their specific economic, 
social and political circumstances. The choice of policy measures must, however, comply 
with the State&#8217;s human rights obligations. Human rights are not a policy option, dispensable 
during times of economic hardship. While a human rights response does not purport to 
stipulate a particular economic system or financial measures, it nevertheless provides a 
clear legal framework for the design and implementation of all policies, including economic 
and fiscal policy. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Some recovery measures and their potential threat to the 
realization of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>38. The occurrence of economic crises does not exempt States from complying with 
their human rights commitments, nor does it entitle them to prioritize other issues over the 
realization of human rights. Rather, it is during crises and their aftermath that the necessity 
of State conformity with human rights obligations comes into sharp relief. It is precisely 
when increasing numbers of people are being pushed into extreme poverty and the 
livelihood of vulnerable groups is being threatened that the protection provided by human 
rights is most vital. In this regard, it is imperative that social spending and service delivery 
is adequate to support vulnerable populations and help them overcome the devastating 
impact of the crises on their enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>39. The section below looks through a human rights lens at some of the specific 
measures that States are designing and implementing, and highlights the ways in which 
they may pose a threat to the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights of the most 
vulnerable sectors of societies. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Eroding social protection systems 
</b></p>
<p>40. In order to avert the worst effects of the crises, and drawing from the experience of 
previous crises in which social protection systems played an important role, many low- and 
mid-income countries have allocated significant percentages of their stimulus packages to 
social protection initiatives.22  
</p>
<p>41. In those countries in which social protection schemes were already in place, 
protected by legislative or constitutional measures and constructed in accordance with a 
human rights framework, individuals and households most at risk of economic hardship 
were able to rely on social protection mechanisms to mitigate the social and economic 
effects of the crises and thus enjoyed stronger protection of their rights. This was the case in 
a number of Latin American countries that have well-developed and supported social 
protection systems. Where no adequate pre-existing social protection mechanisms were in 
place, States&#8217; investments in social protection were less able to respond to the effects of the 
economic downturn, although they still provided an important form of support to those 
most affected by the crises.   
</p>
<p>  
 22  Ortiz and others, &#8220;Prioritising Expenditures&#8221;, p. 4.  </p>


<p>42. Social protection systems play an exceptionally important role in protecting the 
enjoyment of several economic, social and cultural rights of the poorest and most 
vulnerable during times of economic shock and other forms of crisis. Therefore, it is of 
concern that some States are now proposing reductions in funding to social protection 
systems as part of their recovery plans.23  These proposed reductions go against the repeated 
political commitments made by States to provide and promote comprehensive social 
protection systems as key measures for recovery.24 
</p>
<p>43. As part of the efforts to tighten spending, some countries are further curtailing 
already limited social protection schemes by reducing the level of benefits or by further 
targeting (reducing coverage).25 This is despite the reality that those living in poverty 
continue to suffer from the cumulative effects of the crises and should be protected as a 
matter of priority.  
</p>
<p>44. Cuts to social protection systems may violate the prohibition of retrogressive 
measures and seriously compromise the ability of States to ensure minimum essential levels 
of human rights for all, particularly the most vulnerable. By further targeting social 
protection mechanisms, States run a much higher risk of excluding those most in need of 
support, which would violate human rights principles regarding non-discrimination and 
equality and undermine the obligation to prioritize the most vulnerable. If targeting is 
adopted, Governments must comply with human rights principles that require, inter alia, 
minimizing exclusion errors and ensuring that targeting mechanisms are objective, 
transparent, open to scrutiny and do not stigmatize the beneficiaries. Targeted mechanisms 
should also be adopted within a long-term strategy of universal protection.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Reducing wage bills 
</b></p>
<p>45. A significant percentage of post-crises austerity budgets have included proposals to 
limit the public wage bill by reducing the public sector workforce and cutting or freezing 
wages of public sector employees.26 Often these cuts are not progressively implemented, 
and therefore have a disproportionate impact on the lowest wage brackets. UNICEF has 
expressed concern that wage cuts or caps might translate into the reduction or erosion of the 
real value of salaries, as costs of living continue to rise, and may take the form of hiring 
freezes or employment retrenchment.27 The serious implications of such developments 
would be exacerbated by the fact that declines in real wages were already widespread 
owing to the effect of the global economic and financial crises on the labour market.28 
</p>
<p>46. Reductions in the public wage bill will severely impede the delivery of social 
services. If remuneration to the providers of basic education and health care is reduced, this 
could have a potentially drastic impact on individuals&#8217; ability to easily and effectively have

<p>access such services. Limited or decreased staff numbers may hamper the ability of social 
services to respond to public demand, and the removal of allowances or incentive schemes 
might have an adverse impact on the efficiency of employees. 
</p>
<p>47. The above measures will have a disproportionate impact on people living in poverty, 
particularly those in rural areas and the most disadvantaged, who already face numerous 
barriers in gaining access to health care and education services. By adopting policies that 
threaten to reduce the wages of those essential to the provision of such services, States 
would also jeopardize their ability to provide for the widest possible enjoyment of 
economic, social and cultural rights. These measures run a real risk of constituting 
unjustified retrogressive measures if they impede the State&#8217;s ability to maintain minimum 
essential levels of enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights.  
</p>
<p>48. Of utmost concern is the trend towards the cutting of salaries of primary school 
teachers and nurses, the result of which is that, in some States, the salaries received by 
teachers and nurses are barely sufficient to allow them an adequate standard of living.29 The 
erosion of teachers&#8217; wages commonly leads to teacher absenteeism and an increase in 
informal fees.30 This has an adverse impact on the right of children to education and 
increases the likelihood of poor child outcomes, particularly in rural areas.31  
</p>
<p><b> C. Implementing regressive taxation measures 
</b></p>
<p>49. States have an unambiguous responsibility to take steps towards the full 
achievement of economic, social and cultural rights by using the maximum amount of 
resources available. In the aftermath of the global economic and financial crises, it has 
become clear that, in many States, efforts to increase resources for recovery through the 
whole spectrum of available options have been insufficient, thus impeding States&#8217; 
compliance with human rights. Low levels of domestic taxation revenue, in particular, 
could be a major obstacle to a State&#8217;s ability to meet obligations to realize economic, social 
and cultural rights.32  
</p>
<p>50. While raising tax revenue can be an essential part of an effective policy response to 
the effects of the crises, States should, however, be cognizant of their obligations to 
implement policies in accordance with the principles of non-discrimination and equality. In 
this context, the introduction of or an increase in regressive sales taxes or value added taxes 
may have a disproportionate impact on those who are already experiencing financial 
difficulties.33 Regressive taxes may represent an unequal added burden for those living in 
poverty or experiencing economic hardship, as they constitute a larger percentage of 
income. The real income of women living in poverty is particularly affected by the 
introduction of regressive taxes, especially when the introduction of taxes is carried out in 
conjunction with reductions to expenditure on public services.34 States must be vigilant in 
balancing the need to increase taxation revenue with their responsibilities to protect the 
most vulnerable and prevent further inequality.

<p>51. Taxation reform that comes in the form of cuts, exemptions and waivers may also 
disproportionately benefit the wealthier segments of society, discriminating against people 
living in poverty. States that institute tax cuts will decrease the resources available to 
realize their economic, social and cultural rights commitments and increase the risk that 
they will be unable to meet their obligation to utilize the maximum available resources for 
their fulfilment. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Limiting food subsidies 
</b></p>
<p>52. A considerable proportion of States has indicated that they plan to limit or eliminate 
food subsidies as part of their response to the crises.35 From a human rights perspective, the 
decision to limit food subsidies at a time when food prices are escalating drastically36 and 
there is still a pressing need for public food and nutrition support is extremely worrying.  
</p>
<p>53. In recent years, food subsidies have become a common means of ameliorating the 
devastating effects of food scarcity and rising commodity prices on those living in poverty. 
The reduction of taxation on or subsidization of staple foods is aimed at providing 
immediate relief to those experiencing the most pressing forms of food insecurity. By 
providing access to a basic form of food security, food subsidies can limit the prevalence of 
hunger, increase consumption and improve nutrition in recipient households. Food 
subsidies also contribute to ensuring price stabilization and thus create greater food access 
for all.37 To this extent, they are one way in which States can ensure that they meet their 
obligations regarding the right to an adequate standard of living, including the right to 
food.38  
</p>
<p>54. The recurrent crises have taken an extremely harsh toll on the access of those living 
in poverty to food and nutrition, and limited food subsidies may be a blow that many are 
unable to bear. Policies that limit or eliminate food subsidies would seriously threaten the 
ability of States to ensure minimum levels of enjoyment of economic, social and cultural 
rights, particularly for the most vulnerable. These policies may also undermine other efforts 
to address the effects of the crises through, for example, investments in social protection 
systems. Higher food costs can have an adverse impact on social protection systems as a 
result of real losses in the value of cash transfers or income received through social 
protection.39   
</p>
<p>55. While commodity prices continue to escalate and another food crisis is imminent, 
from a human rights perspective it is imperative that food subsidy schemes remain intact or 
be replaced with alternatives policies that ensure food security for those living in poverty. 
Universal access to food subsidy programmes is the most effective means of reaching the 
poorest sections of society, but where resources are scarce, targeting may be necessary. If 
States decide to implement targeted schemes, they should do so within a long-term strategy 
of progressively ensuring universal protection and in compliance with a human rights 
framework.

<p><b> VI. Crisis as an opportunity to enhance the enjoyment of human 
rights: a time for transformative policies 
</b></p>
<p>56. The challenge of recovering from successive crises presents a unique opportunity for 
States to formulate a transformative vision for the future aimed at the full realization of 
human rights. In putting human rights at the centre of their response to the crises, States 
ensure a recovery premised upon equality, inclusiveness and a genuine sense of social 
cohesion. The human rights framework orients the discussion about recovery away from 
deficit reduction and towards the reduction of deprivation and the eradication of obstacles 
to the realization of rights. Human rights do not set standards for growth or economic 
productivity; rather, they set standards for the quality of living that individuals are able to 
achieve and the calibre of services that they receive.  
</p>
<p>57. There is no space in human rights for a trickle-down approach to the achievement of 
minimum essential levels of rights. From a human rights perspective, recovery must start 
with the most vulnerable and disadvantaged. Those who are living in poverty must be seen 
as rights-holders, not as burdensome or as passive recipients of charity.  
</p>
<p>58. Through a human rights-based recovery, States have the chance to embrace new and 
ambitious approaches to reducing inequality, eliminating poverty and creating stable 
societies and economies that will withstand future shocks. A human rights approach is the 
best way for States to rectify the persistent inequalities, exacerbated by successive crises, 
which have diminished social cohesion and increased feelings of insecurity and exclusion. 
Should these inequalities persevere, the result could be increasing social unrest and conflict, 
a reality that has been vividly illustrated across North Africa and the Middle East in recent 
months.  
</p>
<p>59. Increasing inequalities and food insecurity, the declining availability of natural 
resources and unpredictable changes to climate patterns are likely to increase the potential 
for social unrest throughout the world. Any recovery plan must anticipate these challenges 
and assume that there will be many more crises to recover from. What is needed, therefore, 
is human rights-based change that directly addresses the long-term structural barriers to 
equality and sets the foundations for a sustainable, socially inclusive society. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>While the impact of the crises has differed markedly in each country, all States 
must take into account their international human rights obligations when designing 
policy responses. Before implementing any policy measure, States must assess its 
social impact, including from a gender perspective, and should only adopt policies that 
are compatible with their international human rights obligations. Cuts in funding to 
social services that have the greatest impact on the lives of those living in poverty 
should be a measure of last resort, and should be taken only after serious 
consideration of all alternative policy options, including how funding to other areas 
not directly linked with the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights might be 
otherwise reduced. 
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>In addition to the short-term responses to address immediately the impact of 
the crises, States must adopt a comprehensive long-term strategy for sustainable 
development aimed at addressing the root causes of poverty. In this regard, respect 
for all human rights, including the rule of law, gender equality and empowerment of 
women, inclusive participation, freedoms of association and expression, and equal 
access to public services are essential for poverty reduction. According to the 
circumstances of each State, national development strategies should also support </b></p>


<p><b>small-scale farming through land redistribution, equal access to financial services and 
ensuring access to public services and infrastructure in rural areas. 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>Reducing poverty and promoting social inclusion require not only 
comprehensive national strategies but also international collective action to ensure 
equitable international regulatory measures and international assistance and 
cooperation. Particularly pressing is the need to address widespread food insecurity 
and rising food prices. Strategies that support rural development, promote sustainable 
food production and reduce volatility in commodity markets must be a priority for 
States at both the national and international levels.  
</b></p>
<p>63.<b> Acknowledging that no one policy recommendation is a panacea for recovery, 
the Independent Expert recommends a number of innovative measures to which 
States should lend serious consideration when formulating their vision for recovery. 
These are outlined from a human rights perspective below.  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Ensuring a social protection floor for all  
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>The crises have demonstrated that long-term investments in comprehensive 
social protection systems are necessary to cushion the impact of crises, reduce poverty 
and inequality and contribute to economic growth. A comprehensive rights-based 
social protection system must therefore be the foundation of any transformative 
recovery from the global economic and financial crises. Strengthening social 
protection systems now will ensure greater resilience against future crises, while 
supporting the most vulnerable will help to prevent the transmission of the effects of 
the crises to future generations. In order to avoid causing permanent and long-lasting 
detriment to those living in poverty, States should preserve their investments in social 
protection and take steps to increase investments where possible.  
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>The recovery from the crises presents an opportunity for States to ensure a 
social protection floor for everyone under their jurisdiction. This concept refers to a 
minimum level of social protection that everyone should enjoy. A national social 
protection floor is a basic set of rights and transfers that enables and empowers all 
members of a society to have access to essential services (such as adequate nutrition, 
health, education, housing, water and sanitation) and income security (through social 
transfers). The term &#8220;social floor&#8221; can correspond to the existing notion of &#8220;core 
obligations&#8221;, to ensure the realization of, at the very least, minimum essential levels of 
economic, social and cultural rights.  
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>Social protection floor initiatives must be implemented from a rights-based 
approach. In previous reports, the Independent Expert has gone into considerable 
detail about the rights-based approach to social protection.40 The Expert reminds 
States that the right to social security is not dispensed with or diluted during times of 
crisis or recovery; indeed, it is more acute and pressing than ever. In order to ensure 
that social protection systems are in line with human rights standards, States should 
establish a solid legal and institutional framework for social protection measures at 
the national level. 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>By creating legal entitlements or social protection guarantees , States ensure 
that beneficiaries are empowered and become rights-holders. This also ensures the 
continuity of the programme, protecting it against political manipulation and 
preventing programmes from being captured by the private sector or local elites. The 
</b></p>
<p>  
 40  See for example A/HRC/11/9, A/HRC/14/31, A/64/279 and A/65/259. </p>


<p><b>legal and institutional framework regulating social protection should clearly define 
the role and responsibilities of all stakeholders and must guarantee the existence of 
accessible complaint mechanisms.  
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>Social protection systems must also incorporate effective and meaningful 
participatory mechanisms that ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of the 
programmes and compliance with the fundamental right to participate. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>A rights-based approach also requires policymakers to ensure that all persons 
are protected in an equal and non-discriminatory manner. This principle implies a 
preference for social protection systems that are universal. While policies should 
prioritize the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in line with human rights standards, 
they must also form part of longer-term strategies to progressively ensure universal 
coverage. States must carefully screen policy choices to avoid the unfair exclusion of 
disadvantaged and disempowered groups and actively seek out ways to ensure that 
they are reached. In this regard, social protection programmes must be physically and 
culturally accessible to all.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Promoting employment and supporting decent work  
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>A key priority for many States in responding to the crises is the reduction of 
unemployment, which has increased dramatically over the past few years, especially 
among the poorest and most vulnerable groups. Employment creation is a vital means 
of providing income security, generating economic growth, restoring social cohesion, 
preventing social and political instability and enabling individuals to achieve a 
number of economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to work,41 which is 
essential for realizing other human rights and forms an inseparable and inherent part 
of human dignity.</b>42<b>  
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>While the creation of jobs is an integral part of any economic recovery, it is 
vital that States direct their efforts at generating opportunities for sustainable, 
productive and decent work in which individuals can exercise and realize their human 
rights. Employment policies must respect the human rights framework. This has 
broad implications: from protecting workers&#8217; rights to adopting policies to ensure 
equal access to employment by the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in 
society. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>Human rights standards relating to working conditions require States to ensure 
just and favourable conditions of work, including safe and healthy working 
conditions, reasonably limited working hours and paid annual leave.</b>43<b> The right to 
form and join trade union organizations and engage in collective bargaining must be 
ensured.</b>44<b> Workers must have access to a social security system that provides for the 
broadest possible coverage (such as health care, sickness compensation, old age 
pensions and compensation for employment-related injuries).</b>45

</p>
<p>19, paras. 12-21. </p>


<p>73. <b>Any form of discrimination, such as that based on sex, race, ethnicity or 
religion, against workers must be prohibited.</b>46 <b>Workers&#8217; remuneration must be fair, 
allowing for a decent living for workers and their family. Equal remuneration for 
work of equal value must also be ensured without discrimination of any kind; in 
particular, women must enjoy equal pay with men.</b>47 <b>Special protection for women 
during pregnancy, and for persons with disabilities, must also be put in place.</b>48 T<b>o 
ensure the implementation of these obligations, States must regulate labour markets 
and establish mechanisms to strengthen the accountability of private actors. A greater 
number of avenues for dialogue between employers and workers, and the opportunity 
for workers to participate in the design and implementation of employment policies, 
will further assist States in meeting their human rights obligations. </b> 
</p>
<p>74. <b>Considering that the majority of people living in poverty earn their livelihoods 
in the informal sector, under difficult conditions and receive low and irregular wages, 
policies should prioritize improving their working conditions and extending formal 
social protection to them. To this end, policymakers should consider encouraging the 
formalization of informal firms, and specifically of employment relations. These 
measures have the potential to reduce labour market inequality and to extend the 
coverage of labour institutions to groups that were previously excluded.</b>49<b> States 
should ensure, however, that such measures are taken without increasing poverty and 
vulnerability.</b>  
</p>
<p>75. <b>The obligations of non-discrimination and equality oblige States to ensure that 
employment creation policies benefit all sectors of society equally. Policies that 
increase the employability (for example, through demand-driven skills development 
and vocational training) of groups that face specific barriers in their access to 
employment, such as women, persons with disabilities, young people and indigenous 
populations, will assist States in fulfilling their human rights obligations. To remove 
obstacles to employment for women, States should ensure the availability of care 
services (from the State, the community and the market), the redistribution of paid 
and unpaid work from a gender perspective and the elimination of all forms of gender 
discrimination. States are not only obliged to undertake effective legislation to this 
end, but also to take measures to modify social and cultural patterns of conduct of 
men and women.</b>50 
</p>
<p>76. <b>Job-creation initiatives and improvements in working conditions should be 
complemented by investments in social protection systems, particularly non-
contributory benefits and public services, in order to provide comprehensive support 
for those most affected by the crises while also promoting long-term recovery. The 
State must ensure that recovery measures do not discriminate against any segment of 
society, including those who are unable to work or who face greater barriers in their 
access to employment.</b>

<p><b> C. Ensuring gender-sensitive policies 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>Studies by the United Nations Development Fund for Women</b> (<b>UNIFEM) have 
shown that previous and current stimulus packages in several countries have tended 
to favour men over women, despite the fact that women had been more severely 
affected by the crises.</b>51<b> If a gender approach is not actively considered, there is a 
serious risk that the recovery from the crises will also exclude women.</b> 
</p>
<p>78. <b>There are several measures that States should take to ensure a gender 
approach in the design and implementation of recovery measures. For example, States 
should conduct a comprehensive and disaggregated gender analysis that assesses the 
vulnerabilities of both genders as potential beneficiaries of social policies, and design 
responses accordingly. In designing measures, policymakers should consider the 
impact of the crises on women&#8217;s domestic (unpaid) and care work.</b>  
</p>
<p>79. <b>Recovery measures should prioritize investments in education and skill 
development for women and girls, provide investment in sectors where women make 
up a considerable proportion of the labour force (such as in export manufacturing) 
and undertake gender budgeting to ensure that women benefit equally from public 
investments. Policymakers must design, implement, monitor and evaluate initiatives 
through a gender lens, so that policies are able to address asymmetries of power and 
structural inequalities, and enhance the realization of women&#8217;s rights. </b> 
</p>
<p><b> D. Implementing socially responsible taxation policies 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>In several countries, the crises have demonstrated a clear need to maximize 
means of harnessing resources specifically for the realization of economic, social and 
cultural rights. States should identify additional sources of fiscal space to increase 
resources for social and economic recovery. From an array of options, States should 
particularly consider widening the tax base, improving the efficiency of tax collection 
and reprioritizing expenditures. These types of reforms could help States to achieve a 
more progressive, equitable and sustainable taxation regime while complying with a 
human rights framework. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>When contemplating widening the tax base, human rights principles require 
careful consideration to be given to rebalancing the tax contributions of corporations 
and those in high-income brackets. The introduction of new or higher taxes should not 
have a detrimental impact on those living in poverty. Improving the efficiency of tax 
collection requires reconsidering ineffective tax holidays, exemptions and waivers that 
disproportionally benefit better-off segments of society. A human rights approach also 
requires States to take steps to eliminate the prevalence of tax evasion, a problem that 
reduces the resources available for measures to realize human rights. Consideration 
should also be given to reprioritizing spending on social sectors (such as education and 
health) over, for example, military expenditures in order to ensure the maximum use 
of available resources for the realization of economic, social and cultural rights. As 
discussed below, a human rights approach requires States to debate fiscal options 
openly, avoiding technocratic decisions being made behind closed doors, and instead 
allowing for greater transparency and participation.

<p><b> E. Enhancing regulation that protects individuals from abuse by private 
actors  
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>Today, States have the opportunity to address the problems in the architecture 
of the global financial and monetary systems that have been exposed by the crises. The 
weaknesses of a deregulated free market have been brought into sharp relief in recent 
years, and States should utilize this moment to meet the challenge of restructuring the 
global financial system so that it is more equitable and protects against economic 
shocks with the potential to devastate the lives of the most vulnerable.  
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The human rights framework obliges States to take measures to ensure that 
individuals under their jurisdiction are protected from infringements of their rights 
by third parties, and to take all available legal or policy measures to prevent third 
parties from violating economic, social and cultural rights. Accordingly, States should 
take immediate steps to regulate the actions of banking and financial sector entities 
under their control, in order to prevent them from violating or infringing upon 
human rights.  
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>A human rights approach stipulates that legal and policy measures to 
strengthen the accountability and transparency of financial systems should be taken. 
In order for States to meet their duty to protect, the banking sector should be 
regulated to obligate banking institutions to serve the interests of society by, for 
example, ensuring access to credit without discrimination, especially those struggling 
under increased economic burdens. States should ensure adequate means of redress 
for those adversely affected by the actions taken by financial sector institutions, and 
adopt regulations that discourage harmful practices by providing for accountability 
mechanisms that penalize risky behaviours and prosecute perpetrators.  
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>Enhancing regulation requires States to take collective action and to provide 
international assistance and cooperation (see paragraphs 94-99 below). It is critically 
important that States reach a consensus on regulatory actions to improve the 
functioning and transparency of financial commodity markets in order to curb 
financial speculation and excessive commodity price volatility, which directly affect 
the enjoyment of the right to food by those living in poverty.  
</b></p>
<p><b> F. Strengthening State institutional and technical capacity  
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>To address future crises in an effective and timely manner, ensuring that the 
most disadvantaged and vulnerable groups are protected, States should improve their 
technical and institutional capacity to develop evidence-based policymaking. 
Depending on the domestic circumstances of each country, this may include enhancing 
the capacity to mobilize fiscal space and improving research and analytical 
capabilities to identify and quantify the impact of economic shocks on the most 
vulnerable. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>States should ensure that staff in key Government departments are trained and 
have the analytical skills to assess the human rights implications of their decisions. 
States should also put in place coordination mechanisms to ensure communication 
and information-sharing between Government departments on human rights-related 
issues. </b></p>


<p><b> G. Improving the collection of data and poverty monitoring systems 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The sheer surprise with which the most recent crises took the international 
community is telling not only of the rapidity of transmission of the crises, but of the 
inability of States to predict and prepare for shocks and to understand the multiple 
dimensions of poverty. In order to better inform policy debates on how best to 
prioritize the human rights of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged, States need to 
be able to identify them more accurately and efficiently and to assess their needs. To 
this end, States should work towards creating mechanisms that provide better 
information about the incidence and substance of deprivation and inequality. This 
includes instituting means of gathering larger quantities of better quality 
disaggregated data on the impact of the crises and of recovery policies. Data should be 
disaggregated according to several dimensions, such as gender, age, geographical 
location, ethnicity and health status. It is also crucial that, in the face of rising food 
prices, States monitor in a timely manner the development of local food prices in 
order to ensure prompt and appropriate policy responses.  
</b></p>
<p><b> H. Increasing participation and creating a national dialogue 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>A human rights-based recovery from the successive crises must be one in which 
all segments of society play a significant role. The human rights principles of 
participation, transparency and accountability require States to create and maintain 
mechanisms by which individuals can meaningfully and effectively contribute to, 
provide feedback on and claim redress from policy measures that affect their 
enjoyment of human rights.  
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>In order to satisfy their human rights obligations and thus ensure participation 
and transparency in policy formulation, States should construct permanent structures 
and pathways for consultation with individuals, civil society, community 
organizations, grass-roots movements and the academic community. They should also 
take measures to invest in the capacity of these groups to contribute to and participate 
in policy formulation.  
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>Increasing participation in policymaking allows States to assess more 
adequately the root causes of deprivation in any given community, the structural 
challenges to poverty alleviation, the local cultural, ethnic or societal obstacles to 
successful poverty reduction, and the best means of reaching the most vulnerable. It 
therefore increases the likelihood that policies will be effective in reaching the poorest 
members and segments of society and will improve their degree of enjoyment of 
human rights.  
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Ensuring an environmentally sustainable recovery 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>States should only adopt legal and policy measures that are compatible with the 
sustainability and prosperity of communities in both rural and urban areas. Climate 
change and environmental degradation will continue to endanger the lives and 
livelihoods of the poorest and most disadvantaged, many of whom rely on natural 
resources as a basic means of survival. Activities undertaken by rural populations, 
such as agriculture, aquaculture, fishery and forestry, are severely exposed to climate 
change. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>States need to focus efforts on a recovery that can prepare for and mitigate the 
effect of future climatic crises, through, for example, social protection programmes </b></p>


<p><b>that provide economic security to individuals most likely to be affected by crises. 
States should also make human rights impact assessments and risk analyses prior to 
initiating climate change mitigation or adaptation projects in order to avoid adverse 
effects on the enjoyment of human rights.   
</b></p>
<p><b> J. Enhancing international assistance and cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>To ensure an equitable and sustainable recovery from successive crises, States 
should redouble their efforts to meet long-standing human rights commitments to 
provide international assistance and cooperation.</b>52<b> Acknowledging that many 
developing countries have a limited financial and institutional ability to respond to the 
impact of the crises and cannot afford increased public deficits, developed States 
should not use the crises to justify cuts in development assistance. Increased 
international aid could help reduce fiscal pressure for many low-income countries. 
States should therefore take concrete steps to reach the target of 0.7 per cent of GNP 
in ODA. To ensure that ODA is effective, it should be given under conditions that 
respect national ownership and be predictable, transparent and harmonized with 
national priorities. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>States should look for innovative means of generating financial resources to 
assist developing countries in taking a human rights response to crises. In this context, 
States should seriously consider introducing a financial transaction tax. Such a tax 
would appropriately represent the financial sector&#8217;s contribution to recovering the 
costs of the global economic and financial crises and provide a new and necessary 
resource to be allocated to poverty alleviation and development initiatives, including 
the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.</b>53  
</p>
<p>96. <b>The Independent Expert urges G20 countries to give serious thought to the 
proposal by France to introduce a financial transaction tax, and welcomes the recent 
decision to commission an inquiry into the feasibility of implementing such a tax. A 
global consensus on a financial transaction tax would represent an historic decision to 
prioritize the most disadvantaged and marginalized and be a valuable means of 
assisting developing countries to meet obligations to ensure the full realization of all 
economic, social and cultural rights.  
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Consensus and collective action are also essential to address the deficits in the 
global financial and economic architecture. Given that domestic economies are 
intertwined with the global economic system, in order for poverty to be reduced, 
national efforts must be supported by an enabling international environment. In this 
regard, an open, non-discriminatory, equitable and transparent multilateral trading 
system is essential. The Independent Expert calls on States to honour their 
commitments to working expeditiously towards a balanced and ambitious, 
comprehensive and development-oriented outcome of the Doha Development 
Agenda.</b>54<b> It is vitally important that States agree on measures to address the financial 
and economic causes of food insecurity. The Expert urges the G20 to take immediate 
action to improve the regulation, functioning and transparency of financial 
commodity markets in order to address excessive commodity price volatility.

<p>98. <b>International financial institutions  have played a vital role in providing 
financial and institutional support to many developing countries during the crises and 
in their aftermath; however, onerous conditionalities raise several human rights 
concerns. States that are members of these institutions should ensure that human 
rights are prioritized in all policies and measures.</b>55 <b>This obligation lies particularly 
with those States with the greatest powers of participation, voting and decision-
making in the institutions. They must ensure that the actions of the institutions do not 
impede the realization of human rights.</b>56<b> Moreover, States should remain committed 
to undertaking major reforms to the governance of these institutions to be more 
inclusive and representative, and to enhance transparency and accountability.  
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>In their negotiations and agreements with international financial institutions, 
States&#8217; obligations under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights should be taken into account to ensure that economic, social and 
cultural rights are not undermined. In the context of responding to the crises, States 
must take care not to agree to loan conditions that might compromise their ability to 
meet their obligations regarding the realization of human rights.
