organizations have contributed to indigenous peoples&#8217; survival, enabling them to become greater 
protagonists of their own struggles at the local, regional, national and international levels. While 
this, along with certain favourable State policies and constitutional protections, have generated 
greater advances for indigenous peoples and increased visibility for them, these advances have 
attracted controversy and an often antagonistic political environment.

<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The present report follows a visit to Brazil by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, and focuses on the issues of 
indigenous peoples of Brazil in relation to the realization of their right to self-determination and 
related human rights. The Special Rapporteur notes that the Government of Brazil has 
manifested a commitment to advance the rights of indigenous peoples in accordance with 
relevant international standards, having ratified International Labour Organization Convention 
(No. 169) concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries and supported 
adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Additionally, 
Brazil has important constitutional and other legal protections for indigenous peoples, and its 
Government has developed a number of significant programmes in areas of indigenous land 
rights, development, health and education. Nonetheless, the Special Rapporteur observes that 
indigenous peoples of Brazil continue to face multiple impediments to the full enjoyment of their 
human rights. Further efforts are needed to ensure that indigenous peoples are able to fully 
exercise their right to self-determination within the framework of a Brazilian State that is 
respectful of diversity, which means exercising control over their lives, communities and lands, 
and effectively participating in all decisions affecting them in accordance with their own cultural 
patterns and authority structures. Conscious of these challenges, the Special Rapporteur offers 
several recommendations that may serve to enhance the recognition and protection of the rights 
of the indigenous peoples in Brazil in line with the Government&#8217;s commitments. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/34/Add.<footnote name="2">6. The current challenges to the full realization of self-determination by indigenous peoples in 
Brazil are inextricably linked to historical patterns of discrimination along racial, cultural, 
linguistic and ethnic lines that have their roots in Portuguese colonization, which lasted from 
1500 to 1822. Despite the introduction of State policies to reverse the historical oppression 
against indigenous peoples, one sees continued but yet more subtle manifestations of the 
historical disrespect for the interests of indigenous peoples and disregard for their welfare and 
human rights.

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report examines the human rights situation of indigenous people in Brazil in light of 
relevant international human rights standards, and makes a series of recommendations to assist 
ongoing efforts to implement these standards. The report is based on information gathered by the 
Special Rapporteur during a visit to Brazil from 18 to 25 August 2008 and on subsequent 
research and exchanges of information. The visit followed requests by various indigenous 
peoples&#8217; organizations throughout the country and was carried out with the cooperation of the 
Government of Brazil. 
</p>
<p>2. During his visit to Brazil, the Special Rapporteur consulted with Government officials, 
indigenous peoples and their organizations, representatives of the United Nations and members 
of civil society. In Brasilia, the Special Rapporteur held meetings with officials of the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, including the National Indian Foundation (FUNAI), 
the Special Secretariat for Human Rights, the Office of the Federal Prosecutor, the Ministry of 
Education and the National Foundation for Health (FUNASA), and with the Attorney General of 
Brazil and members of the Indigenous Front of the National Congress. He also held consultations 
with the United Nations Resident Coordinator and with representatives of United Nations 
agencies with offices in Brazil. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur met with representatives of various indigenous organizations of 
the country at the national and regional levels, including the Coordinator of Indigenous 
Organizations of the Brazilian Amazon (COIAB) and its affiliates; Articulation of Indigenous 
Peoples of the Northeast, Minas Gerais and Esp&#237;rito Santo (APOINME); the Federation of 
Indigenous Organizations of the Rio Negro (FOIRN); and Indigenous Council of the State of 
Roraima (CIR); as well as with civil society organizations, including the Socio-Environmental 
Institute (ISA). The Special Rapporteur participated in a forum with various indigenous 
organizations during a seminar to discuss proposals for a new statute on indigenous peoples 
organized by the National Commission of Indigenous Policy (CNPI). 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur conducted field trips to Manaus and the Alto Rio Negro region in 
the State of Amazonas; Boa Vista and the Raposa Serra do Sol and Yanomani indigenous 
territories in the State of Roraima; and Campo Grande, Dourados, and nearby indigenous 
communities in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul. During these trips he consulted with State and 
local Government officials, military authorities, indigenous communities and organizations, and 
members of civil society. 
</p>
<p>5. Within the short time period in which the visit took place, the Special Rapporteur 
endeavoured to consult with and receive information from as many indigenous communities and 
their representatives as possible, and had the opportunity to visit, among others, the communities 
of Cunuri in Amazonas; Serra do Sol, Surucucu, Demini Malacacheta, and Surum&#250; in Roraima; 
and Panambizinho, Passo Piraj&#250;, Boror&#243;, and Jaguapiru in Mato Grosso do Sul, as well as the 
Aldeia Urbana in Campo Grande. 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur expresses his appreciation to the Government of Brazil, especially 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and FUNAI, and indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations for the 
support they provided for the visit. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the staff of the 
United Nations Development Programme in Brasilia and the interpreter for the visit for their </p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/34/Add.2 
  page 5 
 
</p>
<p>instrumental role in the preparation and execution of the visit. Finally, the Special 
Rapporteur expresses his gratitude to Dr. Erika Yamada and to the staff of the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva for their assistance in undertaking the visit and 
in the preparation of this report. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  The indigenous peoples of Brazil 
</b></p>
<p>7. According to Government statistics, indigenous people constitute approximately 
0.<footnote name="4">7. Extreme poverty and a range of social ills (even malnutrition and starvation in some cases) 
now plague the Guarani-Kaiow&#225; and Nhandeva peoples of Mato Grosso do Sul. The state has the 
highest rate of indigenous children&#8217;s death due to precarious conditions of health and access to 
water and food, related to lack of lands. In 2007 the federal Government established the 
Dourados Indigenous Actions Management Committee, which has taken a number of initiatives 
to address the nutritional, health and other social welfare concerns of indigenous peoples in the 
state, through partnerships forged with various federal agencies and local authorities. </footnote>3 per cent of the Brazilian population, somewhere between 700,000 and 750,000 people.<b>1</b> 
Despite a history of invasion and ongoing threats to their survival, indigenous peoples are still 
characterized by immense diversity and cultural wealth. There are at least 225 indigenous 
peoples speaking some 180 different languages throughout Brazil, living both on traditional 
indigenous lands and in urban centres. Their languages, customs, rituals, and material and 
non-material heritage, which are fundamental to their survival, contribute to Brazil&#8217;s rich 
demographic mosaic. The states comprising the Amazon region have the highest concentrations 
of indigenous peoples, followed by the State of Mato Grosso do Sul. There are indigenous 
peoples in every other state of Brazil except, according to Government information, the states of 
Piaui and Rio Gande do Norte. 
</p>
<p>8. Academic literature estimates that there were around 5 million indigenous persons living in 
the territory that is now Brazil, speaking as many as 1,<footnote name="3">2. It is noteworthy that such violence has occurred, not just in Raposa Serra do Sol but 
elsewhere in the country as well, especially in the states of Mato Grosso do Sul (against 
Guarani people), Maranh&#227;o (Guajajara people) and Pernambuco (Xukuru people). There are 
numerous cases of land and resource rights activists murdered by hired gunmen or private 
militias commissioned by powerful landowners in rural areas. Land rights activists have suffered </footnote>00 languages, when Europeans first 
arrived centuries ago. Due to various factors common to the history experienced throughout the 
Americas - including diseases introduced by Europeans, forced displacement, and violent 
confrontation with invaders - the indigenous population decreased dramatically, and numerous 
ethnically or linguistically distinct indigenous groups disappeared. 
</p>
<p>9. Despite Government policies that now favour indigenous peoples, historically rooted 
patterns of discrimination against them persist and are pervasive in many spheres of social and 
political life, the most recurrent manifestations of which are lack of participation in 
decision-making, threats to cultural integrity, poor living conditions and, all too often, violence.<b>2</b> 
Many of the surviving indigenous groups no longer live on their traditional lands, resulting in 
urbanization of indigenous communities and a consequent weakening of their cultures, traditions 
and languages. Of those indigenous peoples that remain on traditional lands, many live in 
precarious conditions. According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), 
while 15.<footnote name="5">9. Whereas large-scale development projects and other factors often have adversely affected 
indigenous peoples and their lands, indigenous peoples more generally face significant 
challenges to their own development in economic, social and related spheres. As mentioned, 
census data collected by IBGE maintain that Brazilian indigenous peoples are the most 
impoverished sector of the country&#8217;s population. For a number of reasons related to historical 
patterns of discrimination and loss of control over lands and resources, both rural and urban 
indigenous communities face obstacles to development and are challenged to support themselves 
in ways appropriate to their cultures and world views. </footnote> per cent of the Brazilian population lives in extreme poverty, among indigenous 
people the figure reaches 38 per cent. In applying the concept of poverty in this context, due 
regard should be given the reduced role of consumerism and market economies among 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  The 2000 national census of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) 
</p>
<p>estimated a total of 734,127 indigenous people in Brazil. Survey informants were asked to 
indentify themselves by race or skin colour using the following classifications: &#8220;white&#8221;, &#8220;black&#8221;, 
&#8220;brown&#8221; (mixed-race), &#8220;yellow&#8221; and &#8220;indigenous&#8221;. 
<b>2
</b>  See E/CN.<footnote name="4">6. As already noted, a recurrent impediment to securing indigenous lands is the presence of 
non-indigenous occupants. This can especially be seen in areas such as Mato Grosso do Sul, the 
state with the largest indigenous population outside the Amazon region, where there is heavy 
non-indigenous settlement and land use that has displaced indigenous peoples from their 
traditional lands. Unlike the Amazon region, where vast expanses of land remain inhabited 
mostly by indigenous peoples, the rural areas of Mato Grosso do Sul have been mostly parcelled 
out to non-indigenous farmers, many of them engaged in large-scale agribusiness. This is a result 
of an aggressive Government policy of titling land to private individuals in the last century, well 
prior to the 1988 Constitution and its recognition of indigenous rights. Indigenous peoples were 
forced off their land, or left only with small plots within their larger traditional use areas, 
thereby being deprived of adequate means of subsistence and cultural continuity. Paran&#225; and 
Santa Catarina are two other states in the south-western part of the country in which indigenous 
peoples have been left only with small patches of land, much of it infertile and providing little in 
the way of sustainable livelihood. 
</footnote>/2006/16/Add.<footnote name="3">1. Emblematic of the various elements of the controversy over indigenous rights is the 
Raposa Serra do Sol case, which involved a dramatic challenge to the demarcation of an 
indigenous territory of 1.74 million hectares. A presidential decree, issued on 15 April 2005, 
ratified the administrative delimitation and demarcation of the Raposa Serra do Sol indigenous 
land, located in the State of Roraima, for the benefit of Ingaric&#243;, Macuxi, Patamona, Taurepang 
and Wapichana indigenous groups (adding up to a population of as many as 20,000 people). 
The demarcation process had been opposed by powerful non-indigenous farmers who had 
invaded the land to farm rice on an industrial scale and who had punctuated their opposition 
with violence against indigenous people. The 2005 decree called for the removal of the 
non-indigenous occupants of the demarcated land within a year, but that removal was resisted by 
the farmers who further incited violence that culminated in the shooting of several indigenous 
persons on 5 May 2008.

</p>
<p>indigenous peoples. It appears clear, however, that by any standard, indigenous peoples as a 
whole are disadvantaged economically and in terms of access to political power in relation to 
most of the rest of Brazilian society. 
</p>
<p>10. There are a significant number of indigenous groups that have had little or no contact with 
outsiders and about which little information is available. Surveys conducted by FUNAI identify 
65 isolated indigenous groups, in addition to 5 others that have been recently contacted, in the 
State of Amazonas, and one such group in the State of Goi&#225;s in central Brazil. FUNAI has 
spearheaded the Government&#8217;s policy of guaranteeing for these groups the right to remain 
isolated and the integrity of their territories. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Applicable law and indigenous-specific Government policy 
</b></p>
<p>11. Brazil is a federal republic, composed of a federal Union (<i>Uni&#227;o</i>) with 26 states, a 
Federal District (where the capital, Brasilia, is located) and 5,<footnote name="5">6. In January 2007, President Luiz In&#225;cio Lula da Silva announced the Programme to 
Accelerate Development (PAC), a large investment package to spur economic growth in the 
country. The package would fund US$ 50.9 billion in infrastructure and energy projects in the 
Amazon and elsewhere, many of them to be developed on or near indigenous lands. 
Representatives of indigenous peoples have raised concerns about a lack of participation in the 
planning and execution of the projects affecting them, and an absence of clear safeguards to 
protect indigenous peoples&#8217; rights as part of the PAC initiative. For its part, the Government 
reports that it has redoubled efforts to ensure indigenous peoples&#8217; right of consultation in regard 
to PAC projects, primarily through FUNAI, and maintains that consultations in some cases have </footnote>07 municipalities. The 
1988 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Brazil reflects the efforts of lawmakers to 
consolidate a democratic State aimed - as stated in the preamble and affirmation of 
&#8220;Fundamental Principles&#8221; (Title I) - at ensuring social harmony and individual rights on the basis 
of equality and the rule of law. The five chapters of Title II are devoted to detailing a catalogue 
of &#8220;Fundamental Rights and Guarantees&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>12. The specific protections for fundamental rights provided in the 1988 Constitution are 
supplemented by the several human rights treaties to which Brazil is a party. Under article 5 of 
the Constitution, as amended in 2004, and in accordance with judicial doctrine, the human rights 
guaranteed in treaties duly ratified through acts of Congress and the President are incorporated 
into domestic law and in some cases have constitutional status. Brazil has ratified the core 
United Nations human rights instruments<b>3</b> and some of their optional protocols. 
</p>
<p>13. The domestic legal framework for the protection and promotion of the rights of indigenous 
peoples in particular is based primarily on the 1988 Constitution, which recognizes the cultural 
diversity of the country and includes a specific chapter with two articles on &#8220;Indians&#8221;. This 
Constitution was one of the first in the world to secure indigenous people&#8217;s rights within the 
framework of contemporary thinking on indigenous-State relations, and it remains one of the 
most progressive in this regard. Article 231 of the Constitution calls for recognition of &#8220;their 
social organization, customs, languages, creeds and traditions, as well as their original rights to 
the lands they traditionally occupy&#8221;; provides protections for these rights, especially in relation 
to the exploitation of natural resources on indigenous lands; guards indigenous peoples against 
dispossession of or forced removal from their lands; and places a duty upon the Union to 
demarcate the lands traditionally occupied by indigenous peoples and &#8220;to protect and ensure 
respect for all their property&#8221;. Article 232 of the Constitution provides indigenous peoples and 
their organizations with standing to sue to defend their rights, and authorizes the Federal 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office to intervene on behalf of indigenous peoples in all pertinent cases. 
</p>

</p>
<p>Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/34/Add.2 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>14. In addition, indigenous peoples and their rights are the subjects of the Indian Statute 
of 1973 (Law 6001). Although at the time the law was adopted it was considered progressive, it 
has come to be widely criticized for being out of step with contemporary constitutional and 
international standards in its position of encouraging indigenous peoples to &#8220;evolve&#8221; and become 
more &#8220;civilized&#8221;. The law&#8217;s implementation has been adjusted to reflect the standards of the 
1988 Constitution, and since 1991 there have been debates in the Congress to replace the law 
with a new one, but those debates are ongoing. 
</p>
<p>15. In 2002 Brazil enacted a new Civil Code<b>4</b> which, in line with the Constitution, eliminates 
discriminatory restrictions on the exercise of civil rights by indigenous peoples that were 
contained in the former 1916 Civil Code. Previous to the enactment of this new code, indigenous 
peoples were categorized as &#8220;relatively incapable&#8221; and effectively treated as &#8220;minors&#8221;, with 
FUNAI in a guardianship (<i>tutela</i>) position. 
</p>
<p>16. FUNAI is the State agency principally responsible for executing Government policy on 
indigenous peoples and developing programmes to advance their interests. It was established 
in 1967 and is now an agency of the Ministry of Justice. It is headquartered in the capital, 
Brasilia, with projects in its 45 regional offices, 14 support centres (<i>n&#250;cleos de apoio ind&#237;gena</i>), 
and 344 indigenous outposts (<i>postos ind&#237;genas</i>) throughout the country. FUNAI is responsible 
for promoting and protecting indigenous peoples&#8217; interests and rights; demarcating and ensuring 
protection of indigenous lands; carrying out studies on the various indigenous groups; and 
raising awareness on indigenous peoples and their challenges. 
</p>
<p>17. FUNAI has done exemplary work in several areas, including in the development and 
execution of a methodology for identifying and demarcating indigenous lands, and has 
contributed to advancing social welfare benefits for indigenous communities. However, its 
history is that of an agency dominated by non-indigenous bureaucrats and social scientists who 
shared a highly paternalistic posture towards indigenous peoples and a model of development 
that is not in keeping with contemporary standards of indigenous self-determination. It was 
evident to the Special Rapporteur that FUNAI&#8217;s leadership is conscious of the need to abandon 
the paternalistic postures of the past and that FUNAI has made decided efforts to incorporate a 
policy orientation consistent with contemporary international norms. Nonetheless, he observed 
during his visit that, in many ways, the history of paternalism continues to shape FUNAI&#8217;s 
operations. FUNAI has also been hampered by a significant shortage of resources and qualified 
staff to carry out its myriad responsibilities. 
</p>
<p>18. In a positive development, the Presidency of the Union established in 2006 the National 
Commission of Indigenous Policy (CNPI). It is composed of representatives of Government 
agencies, indigenous organizations and other civil society organizations. By all accounts, 
CNPI is a welcome initiative to ensure greater indigenous participation in the process of defining 
State policy on indigenous issues in Brazil and in reforming relevant laws and Government 
programmes to better accord with indigenous peoples&#8217; own aspirations. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  Law 10.<footnote name="40">. Brazil&#8217;s progressive constitutional provisions on indigenous peoples should be interpreted 
to conform to relevant international standards. Article 27 of the United Nations Declaration 
affirms the right of indigenous peoples to &#8220;own, use, develop and control the lands, territories 
and resources&#8221; they traditionally occupy; for its part, ILO Convention 169 declares in its 
article 14, &#8220;The rights of ownership and possession of the peoples concerned over the lands </footnote>6, 10 January 2002. </p>

<p>A/HRC/12/34/Add.2 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>19. Also significant is the Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Social Agenda, a Government programme 
launched in 2007 to advance a series of inter-ministerial actions aimed at improving the living 
conditions of indigenous peoples. The programme established benchmarks for action in 
three areas: (a) protection of indigenous lands; (b) promotion of indigenous cultures and 
economic self-sufficiency; and (c) enhancement of indigenous peoples&#8217; quality of life. 
</p>
<p>20. Signifying an international commitment to respect and promote the rights of indigenous 
peoples in line with contemporary standards, on 25 July 2002 Brazil ratified International Labour 
Organization Convention (No. 169) concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent 
Countries (hereafter &#8220;Convention 169&#8221;), and the Convention&#8217;s implementation was mandated by 
a presidential decree in 2004.<b>5</b> Also a reflection of this commitment, Brazil voted in favour of 
the adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
(hereafter &#8220;United Nations Declaration&#8221; or &#8220;Declaration&#8221;) on 13 September 2007. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Self-determination of indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>21. Overall, the human rights situation of indigenous peoples in Brazil can be described as 
involving both steps toward, and ongoing barriers to, the realization of their right to 
self-determination. The Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction the advanced nature - relative 
to other countries - of Brazil&#8217;s applicable law and many of its policies and programmes 
concerning indigenous peoples. Despite the notable advances, however, indigenous peoples&#8217; 
human rights, beginning with their fundamental right to self-determination, have yet to be fully 
realized. 
</p>
<p>22. The United Nations Declaration affirms, in its article 3, that &#8220;[i]ndigenous peoples have the 
right to self-determination. By virtue of that right they determine their own political status and 
pursue their own economic, social and cultural development&#8221;. This provision of the Declaration, 
which mirrors common article 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, to which Brazil is a party, 
responds to the aspirations of indigenous peoples worldwide to be in control of their own 
destinies under conditions of equality, and to participate effectively in the making of all 
decisions affecting them. The right of self-determination is a foundational right, without which 
indigenous peoples&#8217; other human rights, both collective and individual, cannot be fully enjoyed. 
23. The Declaration, through its overall structure and article 46, makes clear that the exercise 
of self-determination for indigenous peoples is to be exercised within the framework of the unity 
and territorial integrity of the State, just as it ordinarily is to be exercised by all other peoples. 
Promoting self-determination for indigenous peoples can only strengthen Brazil as a democratic 
State respectful of diversity, by enabling indigenous peoples to become full participants in the 
life of the State with due regard for their own cultural patterns, authority structures and 
connections to land. The Government has expressed a commitment to self-determination in these

</p>
<p>24. Still, it is evident that indigenous peoples lack adequate participation in all decisions that 
affect their lives and communities, and that they do not adequately control their territories, in 
many cases, even when lands are demarcated and registered. As discussed below (paras. 44-49) 
indigenous peoples persistently suffer invasions and resource extraction on their lands by 
outsiders. Also, Government management of natural resources on indigenous lands and 
programmes of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), according to several reports, often 
inhibit indigenous peoples from a wide range of development options involving the use of the 
resources within their lands. The Special Rapporteur also has observed a lack of effective 
mechanisms for consultations with indigenous peoples on development projects such as mining 
and hydroelectric dams that, despite being outside of demarcated indigenous lands, have direct 
impacts on these peoples (see below, paragraphs 55-58). 
</p>
<p>25. As discussed below (paras. 60-61, 64, 67), the State has made significant strides in 
providing culturally adapted social services and education to many indigenous communities, and 
in including indigenous individuals in the management of these services. On the basis of the 
multiple accounts he heard from both indigenous and Government representatives, however, the 
Special Rapporteur can only surmise that more is needed to fully integrate into these services the 
goal of ultimately empowering indigenous peoples to take control of their own affairs in all 
spheres of life. A lack of empowerment of indigenous peoples in the design, management and 
delivery of services, and in the decisions affecting their territories and resources, through their 
own institutions, in partnership with the State and other actors, contributes to a persistent 
relationship of dependency and inhibits the realization of the right to self-determination.

</p>
<p>to influence the content of material that was published or broadcast about them or on their 
behalf. The Special Rapporteur encourages further initiatives such as the Ministry of Culture&#8217;s 
&#8220;Cultural Points&#8221; (&#8220;<i>Pontos de Cultura</i>&#8221;) Programme and Law 11645 (March 2008), which seek 
to promote public awareness of indigenous cultures and rights, respectively, in the media and the 
general educational system. 
</p>
<p>29. At the heart of the discordant attitude in the media are several controversial political and 
economic issues that shape some of the public discussion. There is an apparent tension in public 
debate between, on the one hand, economic development and, on the other, conservation of the 
environment and the recognition of indigenous rights, particularly with regard to land. While 
there are elaborate and groundbreaking federal programmes devoted to advancing the rights of 
indigenous peoples over their lands and natural resources, these programmes have not always 
been understood as being in accordance with the mainstream development policies and 
objectives of the country. 
30. Especially pertaining to large-scale development projects, mining and industrial farming, 
some officials at the state and municipal levels have expressed concerns that indigenous peoples&#8217; 
rights may be a constraint to economic development, and have actively pursued a reversal of the 
gains achieved for the protection of indigenous peoples&#8217; lands and resources. In addition, while 
legislation is being developed to further advance indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, such as a new 
Indian Statute, several bills have been introduced in the National Congress to reverse or limit the 
protections for indigenous rights already established. Brazilian military officials also have a role 
in the controversy and on occasion have engaged the media in anti-indigenous rhetoric. Some 
military authorities have publicly criticized the State policy of demarcating large areas of lands 
for indigenous peoples, especially land bordering other countries in the relatively isolated 
Amazon region, over purported concerns about security and national sovereignty. 
</p>

</p>
<p>harassment, intimidation and threats from large estate owners, sometimes in collusion with local 
authorities.<b>6</b> To its credit, the Brazilian justice system has investigated and prosecuted many of 
these cases, but apparently impunity persists in several others and the threat of further 
confrontation and violence remains. 
</p>
<p>33. Opponents of the demarcation of the Raposa Serra do Sol territory, supported by the 
State of Roraima, sought an injunction against the removal of the rice farmers and challenged the 
demarcation and recognition of the Raposa Serra do Sol territory as a contiguous whole. Several 
rice farmers who stood to be removed from the area joined in the legal challenge to the 
demarcation. They and the state argued that the demarcation of such a large territory was not 
only without constitutional grounding, but that it also affronted economic development 
objectives that in their view are protected by the Constitution. Brazilian military officials 
weighed in publicly with pronouncements of concern that a quasi-autonomous indigenous 
territory running along a lengthy section of Brazil&#8217;s border with Venezuela and Guyana would 
have implications for national security, perpetuating a broader concern about indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights as being a threat to national sovereignty. Indigenous peoples and organizations, 
especially the Indigenous Council of Roraima (CIR), intervened to back the Raposa Serra do Sol 
indigenous communities to oppose the challenge to the demarcation of the territory, with 
strategies that reached into the international arena, in an increasingly polarized political 
environment. 
</p>
<p>34. By the time the case reached the Federal Supreme Tribunal, its potential implications for 
the future of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights in Brazil, especially to lands, had acquired major 
proportions. The case represented the clash of two opposing visions of development and the 
place of indigenous peoples in relation to it: one which sees indigenous peoples in possession of 
the territories of their traditional use and occupancy, and another which sees those territories 
opened up to economic development by market forces, with indigenous peoples relegated to 
small parcels of land. 
</p>
<p>35. After a lengthy process, the Federal Supreme Tribunal reached a final decision in the case 
on 19 March 2009, with a majority of the 11 justices (<i>ministros</i>) voting to uphold Raposa Serra 
do Sol demarcated land as a contiguous territory.<b>7</b> In this respect, the court&#8217;s decision was 
undoubtedly a victory for the indigenous communities of the territory and of the country, 
confirming the essential legality of the demarcation model that has been replicated throughout 
the Amazon region and other parts of Brazil (see paragraphs 41-45), and rejecting the view that 
that model threatens the development or security of the Brazilian State. But while upholding the 
demarcation of the Raposa territory and ordering the removal of the non-indigenous rice 
farmers, the court pronounced an array of conditions, many of them limiting, on the land rights it 
was confirming and on the constitutional protections for indigenous lands more generally 
(see paragraph 38).

</p>
<p><b>III.  LAND AND RESOURCE ISSUES OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Protecting indigenous lands and resources 
</b></p>
<p>36. It is evident that secure rights to land and natural resources are essential to the survival and 
development of indigenous peoples in Brazil, and hence to their exercise of self-determination. 
Under the 1988 Constitution, indigenous peoples are entitled to the &#8220;permanent possession&#8221; of 
the lands they traditionally occupy and &#8220;have the exclusive usufruct of the riches of the soil, the 
rivers and the lakes existing therein&#8221; (art. 231), while at the same time the Constitution deems 
these lands to be inalienable property of the Union (art. 20). 
</p>
<p>37. Indispensible to securing indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to their traditional lands are the 
demarcation and official registration of those lands called for in article 231 of the Constitution. 
Because the indigenous land rights under the Constitution are deemed to be &#8220;original&#8221; - meaning 
they originate in the indigenous presence and not in a grant from the State - the acts of 
demarcation and registration are acts of recognition of the rights rather than being constitutive of 
them. 
</p>
<p>38. FUNAI reports that there are 611 indigenous land areas that are at different stages of the 
formal registration process. Of these, 488 are, at a minimum, at the surveying stage of the 
demarcation process, including 398 that have already been demarcated and registered. The 
488 indigenous lands cover 105,<footnote name="6">3. The poor health conditions are often tied to precarious land tenure situations. As already 
mentioned, the highest indigenous infant mortality rate is in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul, 
where indigenous communities face scarcity of land and consequent inadequate access to food 
(see paragraphs 46-47 above). The remoteness of some indigenous communities is clearly 
another barrier to access to health services. During the visit, representatives of FUNASA, the 
Government health agency, reported difficulties in providing health services in remote areas, 
especially the Vale do Javari region, where its small population of approximately 3,700 is spread 
throughout the entire region, and where indigenous peoples have expressed feeling &#8220;abandoned 
to death&#8221;. In response FUNASA has undertaken special measures to provide health services for 
the remote indigenous communities of this region, although dire conditions persist. </footnote>73,003 hectares, approximately 12.41 per cent of the national 
territory. Undoubtedly, Brazil has distinguished itself as a leader worldwide in this regard. 
</p>
<p>39. The Supreme Federal Tribunal&#8217;s decision in the case of Raposa Serra do Sol, adopted 
on 19 March 2009, articulated 19 conditions that, in the view of the majority of the justices of 
the high court, shape the content of the constitutional recognition and protection of indigenous 
lands, including demarcated and registered lands. These conditions go far beyond the specific 
wording of the Constitution or of any applicable legislation, in what the federal Attorney General 
and some observers have deemed a questionable exercise of the court&#8217;s authority as a judicial, 
rather than a legislative, organ. Some of the 19 conditions confirm protections for indigenous 
lands, for example, exemption from taxation and prohibition of non-indigenous hunting, fishing 
and gathering activities. Several of the other conditions, however, limit constitutional protections 
by specifying State powers over indigenous lands on the assumption of ultimate State ownership. 
A number of conditions affirm the authority of the federal Union, through its competent organs, 
to control natural resource extraction on indigenous lands, install public works projects, and to 
establish on these lands, without having to consult the indigenous groups concerned, police or 
military presence. Other provisions authorize specific Government institutions to exercise certain 
monitoring powers over indigenous lands, in particular for conservation purposes and to regulate 
entry by non-indigenous individuals. 
</p>
<p>  A/HRC/12/34/Add.2 
  page 13 
 
</p>
<p>which they traditionally occupy shall be recognized.&#8221; In light of these international standards, to 
which Brazil has committed, indigenous peoples must effectively enjoy rights over their lands 
that are the equivalent of ownership, and the State&#8217;s property interest in indigenous lands must 
operate only as a means of protection and not as a means of interference with indigenous 
control. Additionally, both under the Declaration (arts. 19, 30, 32) and ILO Convention 169 
(arts. 6, 15.2), indigenous peoples have the right to be consulted on any decision affecting them 
with the objective of achieving their agreement or consent, including with regard to the 
exploitation of subsurface resources owned by the State or the establishment of military 
installations. Whatever the validity or ultimate disposition of the 19 conditions articulated by the 
Supreme Federal Tribunal, administrative, legislative and military authorities should exercise 
their powers in relation to indigenous lands in a manner consistent with these international 
norms. Further, the enactment of domestic legislation or administrative regulations to implement 
these standards is desirable. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Process of land delimitation, demarcation and titling 
</b></p>
<p>41. To its credit, Brazil has developed an advanced methodology to demarcate and register 
indigenous lands,<b>8</b> which is administered by FUNAI and the Ministry of Justice with 
participation by indigenous peoples. The demarcation process begins with the identification of 
the area through a detailed multidisciplinary study by FUNAI, conducted with the participation 
of the indigenous group or groups concerned through their own representative institutions. In 
identifying the area, attention is given to historical land use patterns, as well as to the present and 
future needs of the indigenous people for their physical and cultural survival, in accordance with 
the Constitution (art. 231). 
</p>
<p>42. The Ministry of Justice oversees the demarcation process and adjudicates competing 
claims or challenges to the demarcation. Any non-indigenous occupants of a demarcated area are 
to be resettled and provided compensation for any bona fide improvements made by them, in 
accordance with the pertinent legislation. Non-indigenous occupants may challenge the 
demarcation and the amount of compensation offered before the process is finalized. Often such 
challenges have resulted in the delay of registration of demarcated lands or the outright refusal of 
the indigenous occupants to leave once registration has occurred, or even an increase in illegal 
occupation, as exemplified in the Raposa Serra do Sol case. 
</p>
<p>43. An exemplary, integrative initiative for securing indigenous lands and building relevant 
capacity of indigenous peoples is the <i>Projeto Integrado de Prote&#231;&#227;o &#224;s Popula&#231;&#245;es e Terras 
Ind&#237;genas da Amaz&#244;nia</i> <i>Legal</i> (PPTAL), administered by FUNAI. The project, which has 
supported the identification and demarcation of 40 million hectares of indigenous land in the 
Amazon region, is reported to have contributed to ensuring indigenous peoples&#8217; access to natural 
resources and to have increased the participation and control of indigenous peoples in the 
process of securing and managing their lands. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>8
</b>  Defined in Presidential Decree 1775 (1996) and Ministry of Justice Regulation 
</p>
<p>(<i>Portaria</i>) 14 (1996). </p>

<p>A/HRC/12/34/Add.2 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>44. Despite the advances and the exemplary initiative of the PPTAL project, a further 
commitment of resources is needed to strengthen and support land demarcation throughout 
various regions of the country in which indigenous peoples live. According to information 
received by the Special Rapporteur, FUNAI has been underfunded and understaffed, with a 
budget and personnel that fall short of what is needed to demarcate the numerous and vast 
indigenous territories in Brazil. In some cases in which the demarcation process has already 
begun, the completion of the process has been impeded by a lack of financial and human 
resources. In this connection, the Government reports recent increases in FUNAI&#8217;s budget and 
steps to restructure and enhance its staff. 
</p>
<p>45. Another challenge is the discordant political forces seeking to undermine, halt, or even 
reverse the progress of the demarcation of indigenous land. During his visit to Brazil, the 
Special Rapporteur learned of 5 proposals to amend the provisions on indigenous peoples of the 
1988 Constitution, and of 19 legislative proposals in the Senate and 15 in the Chamber of 
Deputies to suspend the effect of indigenous land demarcation decrees or to change the 
procedures to identify and demarcate indigenous lands. Added to these initiatives is one of the 
19 conditions articulated by the Supreme Federal Tribunal in the Raposa Serra do Sol case, 
which forbids the enlargement of lands that are already demarcated. This provision is feared to 
be an impediment to ongoing efforts to secure adequate land areas for indigenous communities 
that were provided with relatively small parcels of land prior to the current demarcation regime. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Non-indigenous occupation and invasion of indigenous lands 
</b></p>
<p>  A/HRC/12/34/Add.2 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>48. Indigenous peoples have attempted to regain traditional lands that are now under the 
control of non-indigenous occupants. In Mato Grosso do Sul and elsewhere, FUNAI is 
considering demands for the expansion of the indigenous land areas registered under the 
pre-1988 regime and has initiated the procedure, described above, for the demarcation of 
additional areas. In a number of instances, in advance of a final resolution by the State, 
indigenous groups have simply reoccupied places within their traditional territories that are titled 
to non-indigenous farmers. 
</p>
<p>49. The efforts to regain traditional lands have led to tensions that on numerous occasions 
have erupted into violence. Alarmingly, the homicide rate among the indigenous population in 
Mato Grosso do Sul has increased significantly in recent years, with 19 homicides in 2004, 
28 in 2005, 27 in 2006, and some 53 in 2007. The homicides were a result of both internal and 
external tensions, and many killings and threats of violence against indigenous individuals are 
either directly or indirectly related to the indigenous land struggle. The Special Rapporteur heard 
reports of violent clashes between local police forces and indigenous peoples, and accounts of 
harassment by local police forces. He also received reports of violent confrontations between 
private armed guards, allegedly hired by non-indigenous farmers, and indigenous groups that 
have reoccupied land to which the farmers claim title. Related to these kinds of confrontations is 
the criminal prosecution of indigenous individuals for occupying land or engaging in other acts 
of protest. 
</p>
<p>50. In Mato Grosso do Sul, the Special Rapporteur met with a group of farmers who asserted 
that they or their forebears had acquired in good faith Government-sanctioned titles to the lands 
they now use for agricultural production, which is considered the backbone of the state&#8217;s 
economy. They complained that the federal Government now only offers compensation for 
improvements on the land, and not for the value of the land itself, when non-indigenous 
occupants are removed from land that is demarcated and registered as indigenous. They also 
expressed concern that they are unable to ascertain from FUNAI which lands in particular are 
being targeted for demarcation, leaving them in a condition of perpetual uncertainty. A 
polarization of positions and interests was apparent to the Special Rapporteur during the 
visit, and he observed the need for every effort to be made to form a transparent and 
constructive dialogue among all the stakeholders, including indigenous groups, FUNAI, and the 
non-indigenous occupants of lands that may be targeted for demarcation and registration as 
indigenous. 
</p>
<p>51. A related problem is the invasion of lands that have remained or are now in the possession 
of indigenous peoples, including lands that have been demarcated and registered. The Special 
Rapporteur heard reports of the presence of new or persistent invaders (usually for illegal mining 
or logging) on Yanomami and Yekua territory in the Amazon, Cinta Larga lands in Rond&#244;nia 
and Mato Grosso, and on Guajajara lands in Maranh&#227;o. The invasion of miners and loggers has 
various residual security and health implications for indigenous communities, including 
restrictions to freedom of movement, sexual violence against women and girls, and the arrival of 
new diseases brought into the territory against which indigenous peoples have little or no 
immunity, including malaria, tuberculosis and smallpox, among others. For example, in the 
territory of the Cinta Larga people, women and children are reported to have been particularly 
affected by abuse. In Mato Grosso the lack of adequate action to remove the illegal occupants of 
Maraiwatsede territory (ratified in 1998) - the land of the Xavante people - has intensified 
conflict. </p>

<p>A/HRC/12/34/Add.2 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>52. A notable black market for minerals has been developed in Brazil, and many indigenous 
individuals have been criminally prosecuted for the exploitation of resources on their own land 
in the Government&#8217;s efforts to regulate the extraction and marketing of minerals. For some 
indigenous peoples with lands rich in minerals, the exploitation and sale of the resources has 
enabled a chance for economic opportunity on the one hand, but also brought on problematic 
interaction with outsiders that has led to indebtedness by indigenous individuals and the 
weakening of indigenous cultural bonds. 
</p>
<p>53. The federal Government has sought to combat illegal mining and other resource extraction 
on indigenous territories, and to secure those territories from non-indigenous invasion. For 
example, from 2003 to 2008 FUNAI maintained a task force in the territory of the Cinta Larga 
people to address the issue, in conjunction with security forces. FUNAI employed its policy of 
not just evacuating the non-indigenous invaders but also promoting sustainable land and resource 
use projects with the indigenous communities. Such efforts have had varying levels of success, 
as non-indigenous invasion of indigenous lands for resource extraction remains a persistent 
problem for many indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>54. The removal of invaders and non-indigenous occupants of indigenous lands presents a 
significant challenge. While State security forces are necessary to ensure that indigenous 
communities and their lands are protected from invasion, there have also been reported abuses by 
these forces. The Special Rapporteur observed that while further resources need to be devoted to 
ensuring police enforcement for indigenous peoples&#8217; protection, there needs to be a far more 
coordinated approach to security with the consultation of indigenous peoples and in conjunction 
with the work of FUNAI. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Large-scale development and mining projects 
</b>55. Further lacking has been an adequate mechanism of consultation with indigenous peoples 
affected by major development projects - such as the construction of highways and dams - and 
large-scale mining activities, including activities in areas outside demarcated indigenous lands 
but that nonetheless affect indigenous communities. According to numerous reports, with regard 
to many such projects consultations have not taken place directly with the affected indigenous 
peoples through their own representative institutions, prior to approval of the projects and with 
the objective of achieving informed consent, as required by ILO Convention 169 (art. 6) and the 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (arts. 19, 32.2). As noted above, the absence of 
an adequate consultation mechanism reflects a broader problem: the need for fully harmonizing 
Government policies, laws and initiatives for economic development with those to ensure the 
realization of the self-determination and related rights of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>  A/HRC/12/34/Add.2 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p>led to suspension of the project because of indigenous opposition. In any case, there appears to 
be an absence of a well-defined procedure for consultations that conforms to the relevant 
international standards and that indigenous peoples consider will consistently provide them 
adequate opportunity to be heard. 
</p>
<p>57. Major infrastructure projects affecting, in the aggregate, thousands of indigenous peoples 
include the construction of dams on the Xingu, Tocantins, Madeira, Estreito, Tibagu, Juluena, 
Cotingo and Kuluene rivers, and the transposition of the S&#227;o Francisco river. The Tucuru&#237; Dam 
on the Toncantins River has caused the displacement of numerous indigenous families. The 
construction of the Belo Monte hydroeclectric dam on the Xingu river is one of series of 
dams that were planned as part of the Complexo Hidrel&#233;trico Xingu project, affecting at least 
10 indigenous groups by the environmental changes caused by the dam. Faced with criticism 
about the impacts of the project on the environment and indigenous peoples, the Government 
reports that it has pledged not to pursue the project beyond the Belo Monte dam. Even so, 
indigenous groups and NGOs complain that the Belo Monte project is being carried out without 
adequate mitigation measures and consultations with the affected indigenous communities. 
</p>
<p>58. Indigenous peoples are also being affected by international initiatives for economic 
development, such as the South American Integrated Regional Infrastructure (IIRSA) project. 
With total investment estimated at $37 billion from the Inter-American Development Bank 
and various subregional banks, including the Brazilian Development Bank and the 
Andean Promotional Corporation, an underlying project objective is to increase access to 
South America&#8217;s natural resources and put them at the disposal of foreign markets. For 
example, the Madeira River Complex, in the tri-border region of Peru, the Plurinational State 
of Bolivia, and Brazil, is one of the anchors of the project and would transform the Madre de 
Dios-Beni-Mamor&#233;-Itenez-Madeira river system into a major corridor for energy production and 
raw material export. The proposal includes the construction of four hydroelectric dams, most 
importantly the Santo Ant&#244;nio and Jirau dams in Rond&#244;nia that will affect numerous indigenous 
groups. Adequate consultations with indigenous peoples should be ensured for all these 
development initiatives. 
</p>
<p><b>IV. INDIGENOUS DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED 
HUMAN RIGHTS CONCERNS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Policy issues 
</b></p>
<p>A/HRC/12/34/Add.2 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>60. The Government has developed an important redistributive programme, known as the 
Family Stipend (<i>Bolsa Fam&#237;lia</i>), to address extreme poverty in Brazil. Cash is transferred to poor 
families according to the level of poverty per capita and is based on the number of children and 
adolescents in the household. The Government reports that nearly 56,000 indigenous families 
receive the Family Stipend benefit, but that the programme needs to be adapted to the 
sociocultural realities of indigenous peoples in order to better enable their development on the 
basis of their own values and ethnographic patterns. 
</p>
<p>61. A noteworthy development initiative that specifically targets indigenous peoples is the 
&#8220;Indigenous Portfolio&#8221; (<i>Carteira Indigena</i>), a programme implemented in partnership with the 
Ministry of Social Development, the Ministry of Environment and FUNAI to support food 
security, income generation and cultural enhancement projects proposed and carried out by 
indigenous communities themselves. This programme, along with several other Government and 
NGO development initiatives, have achieved positive results in many cases, such as in the 
Cunuri community in Alto Rio Negro, Amazonas, helping to better social and economic 
conditions. Still, members of this community, as well as other indigenous persons interviewed by 
the Special Rapporteur in various localities, many of them in positions of leadership, reported 
that their communities and organizations are not effectively in control of the design and delivery 
of the programmes. In order to be successful and break from cycles of dependency, development 
programmes for indigenous peoples need to be both culturally appropriate and serve to enhance 
indigenous autonomy, including in the management and delivery of the programme benefits. The 
Special Rapporteur acknowledges the substantial financial resources that the Government of 
Brazil has devoted to the Indigenous Portfolio and other development initiatives for the benefit 
of indigenous peoples, and the steps it has taken to enhance indigenous participation in their 
implementation. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Health 
</b></p>
<p>62. By all indicators, indigenous peoples in Brazil suffer from poor health conditions; 
malnutrition, dengue, malaria, hepatitis, tuberculosis and parasites are among the frequent 
ailments and principal causes of death. Indigenous women suffer disproportionately from 
cervical cancer, most likely due to lack of early detection related to scant adequate pre- and 
post-natal care. Indigenous communities also on the whole suffer from alarming rates of 
alcoholism and suicide. 
</p>
<p>  A/HRC/12/34/Add.2 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>64. The Government has made some noteworthy efforts to improve indigenous health services 
more generally and adapt them to the particular needs of indigenous communities, including the 
creation of 34 Special Indigenous Health Districts (DSEI), administered by FUNASA, which 
provide a network of services either directly or through agreements with indigenous 
organizations or NGOs. FUNASA has made attempts to increase indigenous participation in the 
DSEI programmes, through the creation of local indigenous health committees to participate in 
all phases of the planning and execution of the health programmes, and a presidential decree of 
18 June 2009 will make the DSEIs administratively autonomous.<b>9</b> Additionally, FUNASA has 
put in place a nutritional monitoring system for some indigenous communities and worked in 
partnership with the Ministry of Social Development and Hunger Alleviation to distribute 
food and vitamins in the most critical areas such as Mato Grosso do Sul. The Government 
has also established indigenous health posts, which are located in urban centres near 
indigenous-populated areas and are intended to provide secondary or tertiary health services to 
indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>65. Of ongoing concern, nonetheless, is that FUNASA has been hamstrung by financial 
limitations, as well as by severe management problems, resulting in persistent shortcomings in 
the delivery of the health services to indigenous peoples. According to one study, even with 
significant increases in Government funding for indigenous health between 2003 and 2006, the 
delivery of services worsened in most areas and infant mortality rose among the indigenous 
population.<b>10</b> The Government reports initiatives to develop pilot programmes for selected 
DSEIs and the formation of a working group within the Ministry of Health to advance in a new 
management model for indigenous health-care policy and services. Indigenous peoples and 
organizations, however, have pressed for deeper reforms, advocating for a special secretariat 
within the Ministry of Health to take over indigenous health-care responsibilities from FUNASA 
and for further measures to increase indigenous participation at all levels of health services, 
including the training of indigenous health providers. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Education 
</b></p>
<p>66. The Constitution of Brazil of 1988 affirms the right of indigenous peoples to their native 
languages and their own methods of learning (art. 210.2). To that end, a series of Government 
initiatives beginning in 1991 provided for a model of &#8220;indigenous education&#8221; that sought to 
transform the existing system of &#8220;indigenous schools&#8221; (<i>escolas ind&#237;genas</i>) operating in 
indigenous communities into a vehicle of intercultural and bilingual education respectful of local 
indigenous cultural specificities. The Government reports that between 2002 and 2007 the total 
number of indigenous schools rose 45.4 per cent, from 1,706 to 2,480, and that the public 
resources designated for indigenous education have progressively increased. There has been a

<p>corresponding increase in the number of indigenous children enrolled in indigenous schools, 
from 117,196 in 2002 to 176,714 in 2007, as well as an increase in the number of indigenous 
teachers and an improvement in their formal qualifications. According to the Government, 
95 per cent of the nearly 10,000 educators employed in indigenous schools are indigenous, and 
an indigenous person is the head of the Indigenous Education Steering Committee of the 
Ministry of Education. 
</p>
<p>67. In 2004, with the participation of indigenous teachers and representatives of indigenous 
organizations, the Government created the National Commission on Indigenous Education as a 
consultative body. Its efforts have been directed at the development of infrastructure for 
indigenous schools, the training of indigenous teachers and the development of indigenous 
educational materials. Efforts to further enhance indigenous participation and cultural values in 
the educational system include the organization of a National Conference on Indigenous 
Education, to take place in September 2009. In regard to higher education, the federal 
Government programmes known as &#8220;University Diversity&#8221; and &#8220;University for All&#8221; have 
supplemented affirmative action programmes instituted in public universities across the country 
to promote enrolment of indigenous people and other minorities. 
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction that the Government has taken steps to 
establish differentiated educational programmes and enhance educational opportunities for 
indigenous peoples at all levels. Significant challenges remain, however, to ensure adequate 
financial and human resources and culturally appropriate programming to meet the educational 
needs of all of Brazil&#8217;s indigenous peoples. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur received 
repeated reports of inadequate incorporation of indigenous languages and cultural perspectives 
into educational curriculums and texts, which may contribute to the fact that the vast majority of 
indigenous children still do not enrol in school beyond primary education, despite trends of 
improvement in this regard as reported by the Government. 
</p>
<p>69. Additionally, the Special Rapporteur observed rundown infrastructure, a lack of supplies 
and a shortage of teachers in an indigenous school in Mato Grosso do Sul, conditions that are 
reported to exist in many indigenous schools despite the increases in Government funding. In 
fact, as recently as 2005, 34.2 per cent of indigenous schools did not have their own buildings 
and instead functioned out of community buildings or churches, and almost half of those school 
buildings did not have electricity or running water.<b>11</b> Even though resources have been devoted 
to teacher training, the level of teacher qualification is still inadequate, with only 11 per cent of 
teachers at indigenous schools having completed a teaching certification degree and 10 per cent 
not having completed primary education as of 2005.<b>12</b> The Special Rapporteur also heard 
repeated complaints by indigenous leaders that they still face obstacles to playing a meaningful 
role in the administration of indigenous education in their communities.

<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The Government of Brazil has manifested a commitment to advance the rights 
of indigenous peoples in light of relevant international standards, having ratified 
ILO Convention 169 and supported adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Brazil has important constitutional and other legal 
protections for indigenous peoples, and its Government has developed a number of 
significant programmes in areas of indigenous land rights, development, health and 
education. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>Nonetheless, further efforts are needed to ensure that indigenous peoples are able to 
fully exercise their right to self-determination within the framework of a Brazilian State 
that is respectful of diversity, which means exercising control over their lives, communities 
and lands, and participating in all decisions affecting them, in accordance with their own 
cultural patterns and authority structures. Sustaining such efforts is complicated by 
entrenched paternalism toward indigenous peoples, by an apparent lack of understanding 
among much of the public and the news media of indigenous issues, and by opposing 
political forces. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>Within the framework of constitutional protection of indigenous land, Brazil has 
developed an exemplary model for securing indigenous land rights from which other 
countries have much to learn. Under this model, the Government has demarcated and 
registered substantial areas of land, while many other areas of traditionally occupied 
indigenous land remain to be demarcated and registered amid a number of challenging 
factors. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>A problem often to be confronted in the process of recognizing and securing 
indigenous land is non-indigenous occupation of the land. This problem is especially 
pervasive in areas outside of the Amazon region where there is heavy non-indigenous 
settlement, including in the agribusiness belt in south-western Brazil. Tensions between 
indigenous peoples and non-indigenous occupants have been especially acute in the State of 
Mato Grosso do Sul, where indigenous peoples suffer from a severe lack of access to their 
traditional lands, extreme poverty and related social ills, giving rise to a pattern of violence 
that is marked by numerous murders of indigenous individuals as well as by criminal 
prosecution of indigenous individuals for acts of protest. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>Even when indigenous lands are already demarcated and registered, indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights over lands and natural resources are often threatened by non-indigenous 
occupation and invasion. Illegal occupation and invasion of indigenous lands, for natural 
resource extraction or other activities, causes a myriad of adverse consequences for the 
indigenous communities concerned, including in the areas of health and physical security, 
with violent confrontation in many cases a feature of the non-indigenous presence. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>There is an apparent lack of full harmonization of the Government&#8217;s priorities for 
economic development with the existing laws, policies and Government commitments </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/12/34/Add.2 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p><b>aimed specifically at benefiting indigenous peoples. This problem is manifested by the 
absence of adequate consultation with indigenous peoples in the planning and execution of 
major development projects such as dams and natural resource extraction activities that 
affect them. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>Indigenous peoples of Brazil rank low in all human development indicators, including 
access to health, education and justice. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the 
myriad efforts being made by FUNAI, FUNASA and the Ministry of Education, among 
other Government agencies, to improve the socio-economic conditions of indigenous 
communities. Further efforts are needed to combat the scarcity and lack of efficient use of 
resources devoted to much-needed programmes, and to enhance the inclusion of indigenous 
peoples in roles in governmental agencies and in the delivery of services. 
</b></p>
<p><b>VI.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>To the Government of Brazil: 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>Awareness raising 
</i></b></p>
<p>77.<b> In partnership with indigenous peoples, and with the support of the United Nations, 
the Government should develop and implement a</b> <b>national campaign of education on 
indigenous issues and respect for diversity, highlighting ILO Convention 169 and the 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Government&#8217;s 
commitment to these instruments. This campaign should target and seek to involve 
policymakers at all levels, the general public, educational institutions and the news media. 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>Self-determination 
</i></b> 78.<b> Every effort should be made to enhance the control of indigenous peoples over their 
communities, territories and natural resources, including providing effective recognition of 
indigenous peoples&#8217; own institutions of authority and customary laws, to the extent 
compatible with universal human rights standards. 
</b></p>
<p>79.<b> Relevant Government agencies should, to the extent possible, facilitate greater 
decision-making power by indigenous peoples over the delivery of Government services in 
their communities, and assist them to develop the capacity to effectively exercise that 
power. 
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> FUNAI&#8217;s programmes should all have a specific orientation to support and build 
capacity for the exercise of indigenous self-determination and, to that end, should continue 
to increase indigenous representation within its own leadership and technical staff. 
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> All efforts should be made to enhance indigenous peoples&#8217; representation in 
legislative, executive and judicial institutions at the local, state and federal levels, and 
indigenous peoples should be accorded the juridical personality necessary for them to act 
on their own in public proceedings and to enforce their collective rights. </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/34/Add.2 
  page 23 
 
</p>
<p>82.<b> The Government should ensure adequate consultations with indigenous peoples in 
regard to all legislative or administrative decisions affecting them, in accordance with 
applicable international standards. To this end a law or other appropriate mechanism 
should be developed to define a procedure for consulting with indigenous peoples. This 
procedure should itself be developed in consultation with indigenous peoples and should 
apply, inter alia, in regard to the development projects and natural resource extraction 
activities having direct impacts on indigenous peoples, including such activities that are 
within or outside of demarcated indigenous lands. 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>Demarcation and protection of lands 
</i></b> 83.<b> FUNAI should be ensured adequate funding and staff to proceed effectively with the 
process of demarcating and registering indigenous lands, in accordance with the applicable 
laws, regulations and international standards. 
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> Measures should be taken to improve the mediation capacity of FUNAI and other 
relevant governmental institutions to deal with conflicting interests in relation to 
indigenous land and resources, and to work with state and local governments to implement 
such mechanisms and ensure protection from discrimination and equal opportunities to 
indigenous peoples in this regard. 
</b></p>
<p>85.<b> In exercising whatever powers they have with regard to indigenous lands, all public 
institutions and authorities, at both the federal and state levels, should be aware of and 
conform their conduct to the relevant provisions of Convention 169 and other applicable 
international instruments which provide protection of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to lands 
and natural resources, and these protections should be strengthened by domestic 
legislation. 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>Health 
</i></b></p>
<p>86.<b> The Ministry of Health, in consultation with FUNAI and indigenous peoples, should 
continue efforts to improve the delivery of health services to indigenous peoples, especially 
in remote areas, with attention to the special health needs of indigenous women and 
children. Every effort should be employed to enhance indigenous peoples&#8217; participation in 
the formation of health policy and delivery of services, including with a view to better 
incorporating traditional indigenous health practices. All medical professionals should be 
provided with comprehensive medical training that includes traditional methods employed 
and that is provided in the language of the community. 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>Education 
</i></b></p>
<p>87.<b> Further efforts should be made by FUNAI, the Ministry of Education, state and 
municipal educational authorities and local partners to improve the quality and availability 
of education to indigenous children and youth, including through the incorporation of 
indigenous systems of teaching, cross-cultural curriculums and bilingual programming 
into the education of indigenous children and youth, and to strengthen the participation of </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/12/34/Add.2 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p><b>indigenous communities and their authorities in educational programming. Adequate and 
transparent funding for teachers, materials and infrastructure for indigenous education 
should be secured. 
</b></p>
<p>88.<b> Affirmative action programmes for facilitating access by indigenous people to higher 
education should be strengthened in universities across the country. 
</b></p>
<p>89.<b> Opportunities for skills training that would enhance the capacity of indigenous 
individuals and communities to be self-sufficient and to manage their own affairs should be 
developed and extended widely to indigenous peoples. 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>Security enforcement 
</i></b> 90.<b> Federal, state and local authorities are urged to take further, coordinated measures to 
secure the safety of indigenous individuals and communities and the protection of their 
lands, in consultation with them, especially in areas with a high incidence of violence. 
Authorities should ensure that persons who have committed crimes against indigenous 
individuals are swiftly brought to justice.</b> 
91.<b> Measures should be taken to ensure that police and military personnel operating in 
indigenous areas are adequately trained and do not discriminate against indigenous 
peoples, and that they are disciplined for inappropriate or illegal action against indigenous 
peoples.</b> 
</p>
<p>92.<b> Law enforcement authorities should take care to avoid prosecuting indigenous 
individuals for alleged criminal activity when that activity is in fact part of a legitimate act 
of protest, for example, for the recovery of land, and any pending prosecutions for acts that 
were or are related to acts of protest should be reviewed.</b> 
</p>
<p><b><i>Law and policy reform 
</i></b> 93.<b> In consultation with indigenous peoples, new legislation should be adopted and 
existing laws reformed as necessary to implement ILO Convention 169, in light of the 
United Nations Declaration, and to generally harmonize Brazil&#8217;s laws and policies with the 
principles and objectives of the Convention. 
</b>94.<b> All Government economic and infrastructure development initiatives that may affect 
indigenous peoples should be reviewed and reformed as necessary to ensure that they are 
consistent with Convention 169 and the Declaration. 
</b></p>
<p>95.<b> The Bolsa Fam&#237;lia programme should be reviewed and reformed as necessary to 
ensure that its benefits extend equitably and effectively to indigenous peoples. 
</b></p>
<p><b>To the United Nations Country Team (UNCT): 
</b>96.<b> UNCT in Brazil should consider employing an indigenous peoples&#8217; rights focal point, 
if not a team, in order to better incorporate the specific needs of indigenous peoples into its 
programming. This should be done with priority given to including indigenous staff in 
UNCT. </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/34/Add.2 
  page 25 
 
</p>
<p>97.<b> UNCT should consider strengthening its relationship with FUNAI, potentially 
through initiatives that include, but are not limited to, collaboration on projects and 
training programmes with a human rights-based approach to development for indigenous 
peoples. 
</b></p>
<p><b>To indigenous peoples and their organizations: 
</b></p>
<p>98.<b> Indigenous peoples and their organizations should consider devoting efforts to 
working with educational institutions and civil society organizations to develop strategies to 
engage political actors, the news media, the business community and others, with a view to 
raising awareness on indigenous issues and improving or strengthening relations with 
non-indigenous sectors. 
</b></p>
<p>99.<b> Indigenous peoples should endeavour to strengthen their capacities to control and 
manage their own affairs and to participate effectively in all decisions affecting them, in a 
spirit of cooperation and partnership with Government authorities and NGOs with which 
they choose to work.
