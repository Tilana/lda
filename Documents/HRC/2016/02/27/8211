<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 17/9, 
which requested the Secretary-General &#8220;to report to the Human Rights Council at its 
twentieth session on the activities of the International Coordinating Committee in 
accrediting national institutions in compliance with the Paris Principles&#8221;, the principles 
relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human 
rights.  
</p>
<p>2.  The report highlights progress achieved since the previous report on the 
accreditation of national human rights institutions (NHRIs) (A/HRC/16/77) and should be 
read together with the report of the Secretary-General on national institutions for the 
promotion and protection of human rights (A/HRC/20/9), which includes, inter alia, 
information on activities of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR) to establish and strengthen these institutions ; measures taken by 
Governments regarding these institutions; as well as information on NHRIs&#8217; cooperation 
with the international human rights system. 
</p>
<p>3. The Subcommittee on Accreditation of the International Coordinating Committee of 
NHRIs has the mandate to review and analyse applications for the accreditation of such 
institutions and to make recommendations to the International Coordinating Committee 
Bureau on the applicant&#8217;s compliance with the Paris Principles. The Subcommittee on 
Accreditation comprises representatives from one &#8220;A&#8221; status NHRI from each of the four 
International Coordinating Committee regional groupings: Africa, the Americas, Asia-
Pacific and Europe. Subcommittee members are appointed by each regional grouping for a 
renewable term of three years. Subcommittee members designate by consensus, for a 
renewable term of one year, one member to act as the Chairperson. During the first session 
of 2011, Subcommittee members were from the national human rights institutions of 
Canada, Togo, Germany and the Republic of Korea. At its regional meeting held on 17 
May 2011, the European Group of NHRIs appointed France as the new member of the 
Subcommittee on Accreditation, replacing Germany at its second session. OHCHR is a 
permanent observer of the Subcommittee on Accreditation and serves as its secretariat. 
</p>
<p>4. The table reflecting accreditation status of national human rights institutions as of 
December 2011 is attached as the annex. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Improvement of the International Coordinating Committee 
accreditation process 
</b></p>
<p>5. The accreditation process carried out by the Subcommittee on Accreditation, with the 
support of OHCHR, has improved over the years, and has become more rigorous, fair and 
transparent.  
</p>
<p>6. At its 20th annual meeting held in April 2008, the International Coordinating 
Committee adopted a decision paper regarding the accreditation process which addressed 
three specific areas: (a) the composition of the Subcommittee on Accreditation and its role 
and responsibilities; (b) the accreditation procedures; and (c) the substance of criteria or 
minimum standards set for accreditation. 
</p>
<p>7. The accreditation process plays a critical role in assessing the effectiveness of NHRIs 
and in strengthening their performance in the fulfilment of their mandate. On that basis, the 
International Coordinating Committee has undertaken a number of measures to improve its 
accreditation procedures:  </p>


<p> (a) The review has increased its transparency and rigorousness, as it is based on all 
the documented evidence provided by the applicant national human rights institution, as 
well as on the information received by civil society organizations. An appeal process also 
gives the opportunity to the applicant NHRI to challenge the recommendations issued by 
the Subcommittee; 
</p>
<p> (b) The Subcommittee issued more focused recommendations to each NHRI 
(whether &#8220;A&#8221;, &#8220;B&#8221; or &#8220;C&#8221; status) to ensure its full compliance with the Paris Principles;   
</p>
<p> (c) Subcommittee recommendations are more widely distributed among NHRIs 
and other stakeholders to ensure a more proactive role in the context of follow-up action by 
the United Nations or NHRI regional coordinating bodies. Subcommittee on Accreditation 
reports are posted on the internet (www.nhri.ohchr.org).  
</p>
<p>8. According to article 7 of the International Coordinating Committee Statute, one of 
the functions of the Committee is to promote the establishment and strengthening of NHRIs 
in conformity with the Paris Principles. In this regard, the International Coordinating 
Committee continues to give high importance to the accreditation process. According to its 
Strategic Plan for 2010&#8211;2013, its first objective is to maintain and strengthen the 
accreditation process, by better preparing national institutions for the accreditation review, 
tailoring and contextualizing Subcommittee recommendations for specific NHRIs, 
strengthening the transparency of the process, and improving accessibility to the 
Subcommittee for NHRIs, the regional networks and civil society. 
</p>
<p>9. In March 2010, the Bureau members of the International Coordinating Committee 
directed the Subcommittee on Accreditation to review the current accreditation process in 
order to expedite the revision of the accreditation status of a NHRI, where exceptional 
circumstances may arise and affect the independence and performance of the NHRI. 
Subsequently, the 24th annual meeting of the International Coordinating Committee, held 
in May 2011, adopted an amendment to the Statute, by which it included two new 
provisions:   
</p>
<p> (a) Article 18.2 stipulates that where, in the opinion of the Chairperson of the 
International Coordinating Committee , an exceptional circumstance exists necessitating the 
urgent consideration of immediate suspension of an accredited &#8220;A&#8221; status institution, the 
</p>
<p>Bureau may decide to immediately suspend accreditation classification of that institution 
and initiate a special review, and; 
</p>
<p> (b) Article 18.3 regulates the procedure to be followed for the immediate 
suspension of accreditation in exceptional circumstances. A proposal to define the meaning 
of exceptional circumstances is scheduled to be considered at the 25th annual meeting of 
the International Coordinating Committee, in March 2012.  
</p>
<p>10. According to the accreditation procedure, as stipulated in article 12 of the 
International Coordinating Committee Statute, when the Subcommittee recommends to the 
Committee Bureau to make the final decision on the accreditation status of the national 
human rights institutions reviewed, the  Bureau will make its decision after the following 
steps:  
</p>
<p> (a) The recommendation of the Subcommittee shall first be forwarded to the 
applicant;  
</p>
<p> (b) The applicant can challenge a recommendation by submitting a written 
challenge to the Committee Chairperson, through OHCHR as the International 
Coordinating Committee Secretariat, within 28 days of receipt of the recommendations; 
</p>
<p>(c) Thereafter, the recommendation will be forwarded to the members of the 
International Coordinating Committee Bureau together with all relevant material received </p>


<p>in connection with the application, for a decision. If a challenge has been received, it will 
also be forwarded to the members of the Bureau;  
</p>
<p> (d) Any member of the Bureau who disagrees with the recommendation shall, 
within 20 days of its receipt, notify the Chairperson of the Subcommittee on Accreditation 
and the International Coordinating Committee secretariat. The secretariat will promptly 
notify all members of the Bureau of the objection raised and will provide all necessary 
information to clarify that objection. If within 20 days of receipt of this information at least 
four Bureau members of the International Coordinating Committee Bureau coming from 
not less than two regional groups notify the secretariat that they hold a similar objection, 
the recommendation shall be referred to the next International Coordinating Committee 
Bureau meeting for decision;  
</p>
<p> (e) If at least four members from two or more regional groups do not raise any 
objection to the recommendation within 20 days of its receipt, the recommendation shall be 
deemed to be approved by the International Coordinating Committee Bureau;  
</p>
<p> (f) The decision of the International Coordinating Committee Bureau on 
accreditation is final. 
</p>
<p>11. In accordance with the Subcommittee on Accreditation&#8217;s rules of procedure, the 
classifications for accreditation are:  
</p>
<p>- &#8220;A&#8221; status: Compliance with the Paris Principles; 
</p>
<p>- &#8220;B&#8221; status: Not fully in compliance with the Paris Principles or insufficient 
information provided to make a determination; 
</p>
<p>- &#8220;C&#8221; status: Non-compliance with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>12. Regarding the national human rights institutions reviewed in May and October 2011, 
the Subcommittee on Accreditation also received information from civil society 
organizations regarding the functioning and efficiency of the institutions in their respective 
countries. Summaries of all documentation received from the NHRIs for their 
accreditations were prepared by the secretariat and shared with the relevant NHRIs prior to 
their review by the Subcommittee. NHRIs had one week to provide comments on the 
summaries. Subsequently, summaries and comments were sent to the Subcommittee 
members.  
</p>
<p>13. In 2011, the Subcommittee increased its efforts to engage NHRIs regional 
coordinating networks in the accreditation process. The Subcommittee welcomed the 
attendance of representatives of the secretariat of the Network of African NHRIs, the 
Americas Network of NHRIs; the secretariat of the Asia Pacific Forum of NHRIs, the 
European Group of NHRIs and the International Coordinating Committee representative in 
Geneva.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Accreditation process in 2011 
</b></p>
<p>14. There is growing interest in the establishment and strengthening of NHRIs in 
compliance with the Paris Principles, and the number of NHRIs accredited with &#8220;A&#8221; status 
increased to 69 in 2011.  
</p>
<p>15. The General Assembly, in its resolution 64/161, gives greater recognition to the 
accreditation process carried out by Subcommittee on Accreditation by encouraging 
national institutions, including ombudsman institutions, to seek accreditation through the 
International Coordinating Committee of NHRIs.  </p>


<p>16. In 2011, the Subcommittee considered eight new applications for accreditation. The 
National Human Rights Commission of Bangladesh, the Ombudsman and the Commission 
against Discrimination of the Republic of Bulgaria, the Parliamentary Commissioner for 
Civil Rights of Hungary, the Ombudsman of the Republic of Macedonia and the Equality 
Ombudsman of Sweden, were accredited with &#8220;B&#8221; status. The Human Rights Commission 
of Sierra Leone was accredited &#8220;A&#8221; status. The accreditation decision for the Ombudsman 
of the Republic of Bermuda was deferred to the next session of the Subcommittee.   
</p>
<p>17. The Subcommittee on Accreditation reviewed the accreditation status (re-
accreditation reviews) of 23 NHRIs from Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Burkina 
Faso, Canada, Costa Rica, Egypt, El Salvador, India, Mauritania, Mexico, Namibia, New 
Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Northern Ireland (United Kingdom), Norway, Panama, 
Romania, Slovakia, the United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia. The National Human 
Rights Commissions of Mauritania and Nigeria were upgraded to &#8220;A&#8221; status. The NHRIs of 
Argentina, Australia, Canada, Costa Rica, El Salvador, India, Mexico, Namibia, New 
Zealand, Nicaragua, Northern Ireland (United Kingdom), the United Republic of Tanzania 
and Zambia were re-accredited with &#8220;A&#8221; status. The Austrian Ombudsman Board was re-
accredited with &#8220;B&#8221; status. The Romanian Institute of Human Rights was re-accredited with 
&#8220;C&#8221; status. The Norwegian Centre for Human Rights was recommended to be downgraded 
</p>
<p>to &#8220;B&#8221; status and has been given the opportunity to provide in writing, within one year the 
documentary evidence deemed necessary to establish its continued conformity with the 
Paris Principles. The accreditation decision for the NHRIs of Armenia, Burkina Faso, 
Egypt, Panama and Slovakia was deferred to the future sessions of Subcommittee. 
</p>
<p>18. According to article 16.2 of the International Coordinating Committee Statute, 
where it appears that the circumstances of any national human rights institution that has 
been accredited with an &#8220;A&#8221; status change in any way which may affect its compliance with 
the Paris Principles, the Chairperson of the Committee or the Subcommittee on 
Accreditation may initiate a review of that NHRI&#8217;s accreditation. In this regard and in 
accordance with articles 17 and 18 of the Statute, the Subcommittee conducted special 
reviews of NHRIs of Azerbaijan, Honduras, Nepal and Senegal. The NHRIs of Azerbaijan 
and Senegal were recommended to be downgraded to &#8220;B&#8221; status and have been given the 
opportunity to provide in writing, within one year, the documentary evidence deemed 
necessary to establish their continued conformity with the Paris Principles. The NHRI of 
Honduras was downgraded to &#8220;B&#8221; status. The NHRI of Nepal was re-accredited with &#8220;A&#8221; 
status.  
</p>
<p>19. During its two last sessions, Subcommittee on Accreditation issued tailored 
recommendations to the national human rights institutions reviewed. The Subcommittee 
stressed that the founding law of an NHRI should clearly provide for a broad mandate to 
promote and protect all human rights. It has also repeatedly recognized that annual reports 
of NHRIs serve to highlight key developments in the human rights situation in a country 
and to provide public account, and therefore public scrutiny of the effectiveness of an 
NHRI. The Subcommittee continued to emphasize the importance of a clear, transparent 
and participatory selection process in order to ensure the independence of, and public 
confidence in the senior leadership of a national institution. In this regard, the 
Subcommittee has encouraged the formalization of the selection process in legislation, 
regulation or binding administrative guidelines, as appropriate. It has stressed the need for 
greater cooperation and engagement between NHRIs and the international human rights 
system, as well as with civil society, in order to ensure NHRIs&#8217; independence, pluralism 
and effectiveness. </p>


<p><b> IV. General observations 
</b></p>
<p>20. Since October 2006, the Subcommittee on Accreditation has developed general 
observations concerning accreditation. These interpretative tools were formulated on 
common or important issues regarding the Paris Principles and are intended to constitute 
guidance for Subcommittee members on the process of accreditation and on the 
implementation of the Paris Principles. The general observations may be used: 
</p>
<p> (a) To instruct institutions when they are developing their own processes and 
mechanisms, to ensure compliance with the Paris Principles; 
</p>
<p> (b) To persuade Governments to address or remedy issues relating to an 
institution&#8217;s compliance with the standards articulated in the general observations; 
</p>
<p> (c) To guide the Subcommittee in its determination of new accreditation 
applications, re-accreditation applications or special reviews. 
</p>
<p>21. Until March 2009, Subcommittee on Accreditation had developed a set of general 
observations related to the establishment, mandate, composition, independence, 
competences and responsibilities of an NHRI, among others. In November 2009, the 
International Coordinating Committee Bureau made suggestions to improve the 
development and use of the general observations. During its March-April session in 2010, 
the Subcommittee decided to embark upon a review of the existing general observations. A 
decision paper was presented and adopted at the 24th annual meeting of the International 
Coordinating Committee, in May 2011. 
</p>
<p>22. The decision paper includes a number of recommendations aimed at in order to 
standardizing the process of developing and revising general observations, and to increase 
stakeholders&#8217; outreach on the accreditation process and the use of general observations. The 
Subcommittee on Accreditation has been requested by the Committee:  
</p>
<p> (a) To establish formal communications channels with Regional Chairpersons 
and Regional Coordinating Networks to ensure members are aware of, and are able to 
provide input in drafting, general observations at the initial stage;  
</p>
<p> (b) To include greater information on the justification and application of a 
General Observation, taking into account the different institutional models and political 
systems, where appropriate; 
</p>
<p> (c) To adopt procedures that facilitate the timely development of general 
observations and undertake a review of the existing ones, with due regard to enhancing 
their comprehensibility, relevance and clarity;  
</p>
<p> (d) To develop its outreach and education strategies to enhance the 
understanding of how to make use of the accreditation process and the Subcommittee on 
Accreditation&#8217;s recommendations, including the general observations. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>23. <b>The number of national human rights institution applications for 
accreditation continues to increase; this reflects the importance of the accreditation 
</b></p>
<p><b>process in strengthening the independence and effectiveness of NHRIs which, 
</b></p>
<p><b>ultimately, will result in strengthening national human rights protection systems.  
</b></p>
<p>24. <b>The active participation of informed stakeholders in the accreditation 
process, such as that of the regional coordinating bodies of NHRIs as observers, as 
</b></p>
<p><b>well as the growing interest of civil society organizations in providing information to </b></p>


<p><b>the Subcommittee on Accreditation, are welcome developments. The Subcommittee on 
</b></p>
<p><b>Accreditation is encouraged to develop more systematic cooperation with civil society 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations while undertaking the review of NHRIs applications. 
</b></p>
<p>25. <b>The steps taken by the International Coordinating Committee to expedite the 
revision of the accreditation status of an NHRI, in cases where exceptional 
</b></p>
<p><b>circumstances arise and affect the independence and performance of such NHRIs, are 
</b></p>
<p><b>welcomed</b>. <b>This enhancement of the accreditation process will encourage NHRIs to 
continue fulfilling their mandate effectively</b>, <b>for instance</b> <b>in the situation of a coup 
</b>d&#8217;&#233;tat or state of emergency<b>.  
</b></p>
<p>26. <b>The recommendations issued by the Subcommittee on Accreditation, as a 
result of reviews of NHRI applications are tailored to each reviewed NHRI. States and 
</b></p>
<p><b>other stakeholders, including United Nations agencies, are called upon to join efforts 
</b></p>
<p><b>and follow up on the Subcommittee on Accreditation's recommendations to enable 
</b></p>
<p><b>NHRIs to fully comply with the Paris Principles, both in law and in practice.  
</b></p>
<p>27. <b>The Subcommittee on Accreditation underlines that NHRIs should have a 
broad mandate to promote and protect all human rights, including economic, social 
</b></p>
<p><b>and cultural rights. The States are encouraged to provide NHRIs with a mandate as 
</b></p>
<p><b>broad as possible that includes the promotion and protection of all rights set out in 
</b></p>
<p><b>international and regional instruments.   
</b></p>
<p>28. <b>The Subcommittee attaches great importance to the transparent and open 
appointment process of members of NHRIs, with participation of relevant 
</b></p>
<p><b>stakeholders, including civil society organizations. States are called upon to ensure the 
</b></p>
<p><b>openness and transparency of the appointment process.   
</b></p>
<p>29. <b>The Subcommittee emphasizes the value of annual NHRI  reports in 
highlighting key concerns and developments in the situation of human rights in a 
</b></p>
<p><b>country and in providing public account of the effectiveness of an NHRI. In this 
</b></p>
<p><b>regard, NHRIs are encouraged to regularly report on their activities, as well as on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights situation in the country, and to ensure that such reports are broadly 
</b></p>
<p><b>disseminated. 
</b></p>
<p>30. <b>The review of the general observations of the Subcommittee on Accreditation 
is an important initiative, since they are an additional and progressive interpretative 
</b></p>
<p><b>tool of the Paris Principles. The development of additional general observations, inter 
</b></p>
<p><b>alia on national human rights institutions serving as national monitoring and 
</b></p>
<p><b>preventive mechanisms, on the quasi-judicial competency of national human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions, and on assessing their performance, is further encouraged. </b></p>
