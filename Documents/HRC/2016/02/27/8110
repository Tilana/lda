<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its thirteenth 
session from 21 May to 4 June 2012.  The review of Morocco was held at the 4th meeting,

Justice and Freedoms. At its 10th meeting held on 25 May 2012, the Working Group 
adopted the report on Morocco. 
</p>
<p>2. On 3 May 2012, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Morocco: Burkina Faso, Bangladesh and 
Italy. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to Council resolution 5/1<b> </b>and

</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Denmark, Ireland, Slovenia, United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden was

</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Kingdom of Morocco indicated that its national report under the universal 
periodic review (UPR) had been elaborated based on a participatory approach in which all 
the stakeholders concerned have contributed. This made it possible to grasp and appropriate 
the nature, foundations and goals of this mechanism. 
</p>
<p>6. Morocco renewed its commitment to continuing its cooperation with the United 
Nations human rights system, and openness to constructive dialogue and interaction with all 
its mechanisms, especially the Human Rights Council, treaty bodies and special procedures. 
</p>
<p>7. With a view to fulfilling its commitments related to the full interaction with and 
openness to the special procedures, Morocco received since its first periodic review the 
Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the Independent Expert on 
cultural rights and the Working Group on Discrimination against Women in Law and 
Practice. These mechanisms visited many regions of the country, and noticed on the ground 
the achievements made in the areas falling within their scope of work in particular, and in 
human rights in general. Morocco will receive a number of these mechanisms, including the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture in September 2012. Morocco reiterates its 
openness to all thematic special procedures of the Council, and would facilitate their work 
in an unimpeded and unrestricted manner. </p>


<p>8. Morocco has attached special importance to the implementation of the 
recommendations made during its first review and responded to all those which were 
accepted. It ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and 
its Optional Protocol, the First and Second Additional Protocols to the 1949 Geneva 
Conventions and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons 
Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime. 
</p>
<p>9. Furthermore, Morocco has already launched the process of ratification or adhesion 
to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OPCAT), the First Protocol to 
the International Covenant on Civil Political Rights, and the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. It also 
signed the Third Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on 
communications procedure, and embarked upon procedures to ratify the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. 
</p>
<p>10. Moreover, it withdrew its reservations to the provisions of the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which have 
become obsolete given the legislative reforms made, namely the Family Law and 
Nationality Act. 
</p>
<p>11. Morocco ensured that the measures and actions to prevent torture were strengthened 
in law and practice and that prison conditions were improved. It also saw to it that the 
Equity and Reconciliation Commission recommendations were implemented, particularly 
those related to truth, individual and community reparations, as well as the judicious 
recommendations on institutional and legislative reforms, which were all enshrined in the 
new Constitution approved by popular referendum on 1 July 2011. 
</p>
<p>12. Considering the fact that some recommendations fall within the reform process, 
especially those related to the promotion of human rights, human rights education and 
training, protection of the rights of migrants and completion of the harmonization of 
national laws with international human rights standards, Morocco embarked on its 
implementation, based on strategic human rights planning, pursuant to the 1993 Vienna 
Conference recommendation in this regard. This concerns mainly the elaboration and start 
of implementation of the Platform for Promotion of the Human Rights Culture and the 
elaboration of the National Action Plan on Democracy and Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>13. It should be noted that attention was accorded tothe recommendation on the 
adherence to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The new Constitution 
provides for the criminalization of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and all 
systematic and serious human rights violations. In addition, several crimes provided for in 
the Rome Statute are included in the Moroccan draft criminal code. Curbing impunity is 
also considered a strategic choice, which would enable the Kingdom to adhere to the 
international justice system. 
</p>
<p>14. Morocco has been engaged in a comprehensive reform process which culminated in 
the adoption of the new Constitution, whose guiding principles are the Royal Address of 
King Mohammed VI dated March 6, 2011. All the concerned stakeholders were involved in 
this drafting process which was a major step to ensure a real and effective democratic 
transition. 
</p>
<p>15. Human rights are the backbone of the new Constitution. They appear in all its 
chapters, including its preamble which is an integral part thereof. The new Constitution 
enshrines the concept of participative democracy, through the broadened pluralist and 
citizenship participation in political life and in the management of public affairs. With a 
view to consolidating democracy and giving a concrete content for the human rights 
protection guarantees, the new Constitution outlines key provisions on the separation and </p>


<p>balance of powers, the guarantees to entrench the independence of the judiciary and to 
upgrade it to a real power, the principles and rules of active and responsive citizenship, the 
promotion of good governance and linking responsibility with accountability. 
</p>
<p>16. The new Constitution provided for advanced regionalization, starting with the 
Southern Provinces, allowing the local population to manage their own affairs and enhance 
local democracy, as a prelude to the implementation of the autonomy statute proposed by 
Morocco as a political solution to the Sahara dispute. 
</p>
<p>17. Pursuant to the Constitution, Morocco witnessed in November 2011 legislative 
elections which were fair, free and professionally organized, according to national and 
international observers. As a result, a new House of Representatives was elected and a new 
Head of Government appointed from a political party which used to be in the opposition, in 
a democratic and political alternation. 
</p>
<p>18. With a view to enabling Morocco to have a coherent, modern and effective national 
human rights system, the institutional framework responsible for the promotion and 
protection of human rights was reinforced. The Advisory Council on Human Rights was 
upgraded to a National Human Rights Council, with a stronger mandate and as a real 
redress mechanism with more action through regional mechanisms for the promotion and 
protection of human rights. The Mediator Institution was set up and replaced the Diwan al-
Madalim (Ombudsman), with broader protection and proposal-making mandate to improve 
the performance of administration and public facilities. Many bodies have been 
constitutionalized and the National Commission for International Humanitarian Law and 
the Interministerial Delegation for Human Rights was created. 
</p>
<p>19. Taking into account the role of the judiciary in the protection of freedoms and 
human rights, the Government with the support of the King has given particular attention to 
the reform of justice with all its components. In order to boost this project, a high instance 
in charge of organizing a national dialogue on a thorough and profound reform of the 
justice system was set up. All the parties concerned participate in this dialogue with a view 
to elaborating and adopting a national chart for justice. 
</p>
<p>20. Great efforts have also been made to better manage penitentiary institutions and 
improve their situation, in such a way as to ensure human dignity therein and increase the 
opportunities of training and reintegration of prisoners into society. The fact that these 
institutions are open to the visits of national human rights institutions has improved the 
situation and humanization of prisons. 
</p>
<p>21. In order to capitalize on the national gains in the areas of freedom of opinion and 
expression, a broad national debate on freedom of media and publishing has been launched. 
Morocco has also experienced broader exercise of the right of assembly and demonstration, 
in a context of pure political openness and democracy build-up. 
</p>
<p>22. Despite the challenges and difficulties facing the national economy due to the global 
economic crisis and the slowing growth of the economies of many countries worldwide, 
Morocco continued to fulfil its obligations arising from the implementation of economic, 
social, cultural and environment rights. 
</p>
<p>23. Considering the cultural diversity of Morocco, several constitutional gains have been 
achieved with regard to the enjoyment of cultural rights. The Amazigh language is 
considered as an official language of the State and a shared heritage belonging to all 
Moroccans, and a national council for languages and Moroccan culture is provided for. In 
addition, Morocco ensured that its efforts are enhanced to integrate the Amazigh and 
Sahrawi Hassani cultures in the areas of education, training, media, communication and 
cultural creativity. </p>


<p>24. Regarding women&#8217;s rights, Morocco has taken several measures to promote gender 
equality. It has combated gender-based violence and gender has been taken into account in 
public budgets, access to public services and facilities, and participation in the management 
of public affairs. In the field of group rights, several measures have been taken to ensure the 
rights of persons with disabilities, children, migrants and refugees. 
</p>
<p>25. Morocco underlined the importance of the progress achieved and that it would 
continue its efforts to accomplish further reforms in order to consolidate the rule of law and 
respect of all human rights. To that effect, it expected more support from the international 
community. Morocco hoped that this progress would be crowned by its election as a 
member of the Human Rights Council for the period 2014&#8211;2016.

<p>69. Morocco thanked all delegates who paid tribute to its efforts, made 
recommendations or observations in order to improve conditions regarding respect of 
human rights in the country. It reaffirmed the fact that the Kingdom has great ambitions to 
guarantee human rights as defined on the universal level and was trying to include all its 
institutions to consecrate these rights despite difficulties and obstacles. It is true that 
Morocco was passing through real process of transition to democracy. In the context of this 
transition and for the first time, a constitutional document was issued, including rights and 
freedoms. There is a Parliament which was democratically elected. This election was 
observed by international and local observers. A Government of coalition was formed after </p>


<p>the opposition won parliamentary election. Also, for the first time, Morocco also has a 
judicial authority, which is headed by the Higher Council for judicial authorities. The 
Constitution provides that there should be no interference in cases brought before the law 
and the judge should not receive any instruction, or subject to any pressure. Other 
fundamental freedoms are also protected. 
</p>
<p>70. On the question regarding freedom of the press, Morocco indicated that there was no 
control of journalists, who carry out their function in total freedom. Regarding the law on 
journalism, Morocco confirmed that the existing law would be amended, in particular 
cancelling any punishment through imprisonment. It also indicated that during the past four 
years, only two journalists had been detained. As regards the freedom of demonstration, it 
is guaranteed by the law. Unemployed young people who seek employment, sometimes 
obstruct traffic or occupy public buildings, in which cases intervention become imperative. 
Morocco tries to limit these interventions. 
</p>
<p>71. Morocco recognized the importance of education and the training programmes for 
law enforcement officials. Regarding the criminalization of enforced disappearance or to 
limit this phenomenon, the Equity and Reconciliation Commission has carried out 
important role during the transitional period and has already recommended that Morocco 
put an end to cases of enforced disappearance, which is prohibited by the Constitution, 
article 23, and the law. Morocco has also signed the International Convention on Enforced 
Disappearance which should be ratified soon by the Parliament. Morocco signed the Rome 
Statute of the International Criminal Court in 2000; it was trying to prepare all the 
necessary papers to incorporate these prohibitions in national law. Since 1993, no capital 
punishment has been carried out. There is also a draft law which aims at reducing the 
number of crimes punished with the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>72. Among best practices of the national human rights institution are the pluralist 
composition of the institution, with reinforcement of its mandate, particularly in the field of 
the protection of human rights, complaints are dealt with, there are regional mechanisms. It 
has become a constitutional institution, and therefore would have to submit annual reports 
to the Parliament. Morocco has done strategic planning in the field of human rights in line 
with the 1993 World Human Rights Conference. The national institution coordinates 
between different sectors of the civil society and different plans, particularly those 
concerning vulnerable groups. Some rights are now enshrined in the Constitution such as 
the right to access to water, environment and sustainable development and the Government 
has drafted a Charter in this regard. 
</p>
<p>73. The mandate of MINURSO is defined by the Security Council resolutions, starting 
from resolution 690 (1991) continuing to its resolution 2044 (2012), and the agreements 
between Morocco and MINURSO namely: supervision of the ceasefire and assistance in 
implementing programmes related to demining and confidence building measures. The 
recent resolutions are clear about the mandate of the MINURSO. With regard to human 
rights, resolution 2044 (2012) welcomed the opening of two National Councils on Human 
Rights Commissions in the Sahara, and the commitment to open further to all current 
special procedures of the United Nations Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>74. The law forbids any violence against detainees. Coerced confession obtained 
through torture is inadmissible in court and is a crime. There are mechanisms for the 
prevention of torture and detainees have the possibility of access to a lawyer in the first 
hour of the detention. As of 2008, members of the prosecution increased their visits to 
prisons. Complaints of torture are investigated and prosecuted. Juvenile delinquents are 
judged by special judges in juvenile justice. There has been a national strategy to combat 
violence against women in force since 2002. Laws were revised to provide greater 
protection for women. </p>


<p>75. The right to housing is enshrined under the new Constitution. Morocco undertook 
sustained efforts to ensure access to housing for the greatest possible number of people and 
low&#8211;income households. The Government is intensifying and diversifying housing by 
carrying out dedicated programmes in order to eradicate slums by 2016 through the 
construction of social housing, low and middle-cost houses. There is also a programme 
combating exclusion in the slums. It&#8217;s a public/private partnership with local communities 
and Ministries involved. The national human development programme is in its second 
phase, including combating poverty in rural and urban areas based on a participatory 
philosophy, active solidarity, the gender perspective and a constant desire to ensure that 
activities are located in their own territories, in particular where wealth is created. Morocco 
is achieving outstanding results, particularly for the Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs). 
</p>
<p>76. Estonia commended Morocco for ratifying the First Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and for introducing a 
National Plan of Action in the area of democracy and human rights. It welcomed the 
withdrawal of its reservations to two articles of CEDAW although concerned that 
discrimination against women still existed.  Estonia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>77. Ethiopia, commending Morocco on its efforts and commitment to improving human 
rights in its country, asked whether the new Constitution gave special attention to the 
promotion of local languages and what measures had been adopted in that regard. 
</p>
