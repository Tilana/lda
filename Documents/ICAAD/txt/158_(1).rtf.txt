1.      
Background

On 24 October 2005 at Ba Magistrates Court default judgment was entered in favour of the Plaintiff in the substantive action by Pargan Singh against Mahendra Kaur and Sarjit Singh. On 10 September 2007 Ba Magistrates Court granted the Defendants/Appellants application for setting aside default judgment, but upon conditions.

1.1     
The Magistrate hearing the application to set aside determined that he should do so, albeit he was not the Magistrate who had granted default judgment, due to inordinate delay in progressing the application: Court Record, p. 25

1.2     
There is no dispute between the parties as to what occurred on 24 October 2005 that led to the entering of default judgment, nor the stage pleadings had reached at that time. Rather, the dispute lies in the question whether setting aside should have been as of right and hence unconditional. 

1.3     
There are in effect two areas of dispute. The first relates to the entry of default judgment itself. The second to the setting aside of the default judgment.

1.5     
The first dispute (entry of default judgment) revolves around whether default judgment is entered regularly or irregularly, where:

"        
Notice of Intention to Defend is filed along with a Statement of Defence, as was so here; and/or
"        
No evidence is taken from the Plaintiff in respect of her/his case, the Magistrate relying upon the pleadings alone as the basis for the default judgment.

1.6     
The second dispute lies in the setting aside of default judgment at all, and in the basis on which it was set aside. 

1.7     
 The Appellants/Defendants say default judgment was entered irregularly and not in compliance with the Magistrates Court Rules, because if judgment were to be entered, it could be done only upon calling evidence from the Plaintiff. Hence, setting aside should be as of right and hence without conditions. Further, the Appellants/Defendants challenge the Magistrates reliance at the setting aside upon admissions in the Statement of Defence and the contention that the onus lay upon the Defendants to prove their defence. 

1.8     
The Respondent/Plaintiff says there is nothing irregular about the default judgment or its entry on the record: there was evidence before the Court in the pleadings, by reason of application of the Magistrates Court Rules.

2.      
Judgment in Default

The Magistrates Court orders in the judgment in default were sealed on 17 November 2005. The Court Record shows:

JUDGMENT

BEFORE THE RESIDENT MAGISTRATE & ON THE 24TH OF OCTOBER 2005

UPON READING the Pleadings filed herein,

AND upon hearing Mr JM Boseiwaqa as Counsel for the Plaintiff and upon leave being granted to Messrs Sahu Khan & Sahu Khan to withdraw as Solicitors for the Defendants for lack of instructions.

IT IS HEREBY ADJUDGED:

(a)     
That Judgment is entered for the Plaintiff in the sum of $8,973.77 (Eight Thousand Nine Hundred Seventy-Three Dollars and Seventy-Seven Cents) and interest in the sum of $897.37 (Eight Hundred Ninety-Seven Dollars and Thirty-Seven Cents) at the rate of ten (10) per centum per annum from the 22nd day of October 2004 to the 24th day of October 2005.

3.      
History of Action

The action began with a Statement of Claim filed in the First Class Magistrates Court, Western Division at Ba, on 1 December 2004. The Plaintiff claimed the sum of $8973.77, comprising:

"        
A principal amount of $7983.00 due and owing pursuant to Deed dated 22 July 2003; and
"        
An amount of $990.77 being agreed interest to be paid at the rate of 10% per annum from 25 July 2003 to 21 October 2004: Court Record, p. 14

3.1     
On 13 January 2005 the Defendants filed a Notice to Defend.

3.2     
On 17 January 2005, the return date, both Plaintiff and Defendants were represented by Counsel. The matter was listed for mention on 14 February 2005, with the Defendants being granted 21 days to file their defence: Court Record, p. 17

3.3     
On 14 February 2005, the mention date, there was no appearance by or for the Plaintiff. The Defendants were represented by Counsel, with a further 21 days to file the Statement of Defence granted, the matter being set for 11 April 2005 for mention: Court Record, p. 17

3.4     
On 11 April 2005, the parties were represented by Counsel. The court granted 21 days for the Plaintiff to file a Reply to Defence. The matter was listed for hearing on 24 October 2005: Court Record, p. 18

3.5     
On 24 October 2005, the listed hearing date, the Plaintiff was present and represented by Counsel. The Defendants were not in Court and their Counsel sought leave to withdraw for lack of instructions. Leave to withdraw was granted. Counsel for the Plaintiff sought judgment in default. The Court granted judgment in default and costs against the Defendants: Court Record, p. 18

3.6     
On 26 October 2005, the Defendants filed a Notice of Motion seeking to have the Judgment entered on 24 October 2005 set aside and the matter listed for hearing: Court Record, p. 38

3.6     
Both Plaintiff and Defendants acknowledge that on the date of hearing, 24 October 2005, the Defendants were present at Court earlier in the day. 

3.7     
In his Affidavit filed on 27 October 2005 in support of the application to have default judgment set aside, the Second Defendant Mr Sarjit Singh said amongst other matters:

This matter was listed for hearing on 24th day of October 2005 and we had filed our Notice of Intention to Defend and Statement of Defence and we were ready for the trial but & on the date of hearing there was a misunderstanding on our part as we thought our case will not commence before the morning break.

My mother [the Defendant Mrs Mahendar Kaur] and I had come to the Court at 9.00 oclock but seeing the list I assumed that the case will not commence before 11.00 oclock and we went away with the view to return to Court again.

Accordingly we reached Court at about 11.00 oclock but then I was informed that Judgment by Default had been entered: Court Record, pp. 6-7

3.8     
The Plaintiff/Respondent in his Affidavit in opposition to the application states amongst other matters:

On the 24th of October 2005 at approximately 9.00am I was sitting outside the Magistrates Court with my witnesses waiting for my case to be called when I saw the Defendants.

I do not know why the Defendants say that their case would be called at 11.00am when the Cause List says 9.00am. I came all the way from New Zealand for this case and waited patiently for my matter to be called. The Defendants reside here in Ba and they could have waited as well.

When my matter was eventually called I was present in Court with my witnesses. There was no sign of the Defendants. However the Defendants counsel was present that day and she was given leave by the Court to withdraw as solicitors for lack of instructions.

My counsel then obtained judgment in my favour: Court Record, p. 9

3.9     
Adverting to the position of the Defendants on the day of the hearing, in his Ruling granting on conditions the Defendants application for setting aside default judgment the Magistrate said:

The 2nd defendant has filed an affidavit on behalf of her [sic] mother (1st defendant) and herself. She deposes that both of them were present at Court on 24/10/05 and had arrived at about 9.00am and saw the cause list and presumed that the case will not be called until 11.00am and went away and came back to Court at about 11.00am and found out that default judgment had been entered.

The affidavit does not state as to whether the defendants had any contact with their solicitors on 24/10/05 or a few days prior to that. I presume that they had no contact with their solicitors as Ms S. Sahu Khan sought leave to withdraw as solicitor for lack of instructions.

The plaintiff filed an affidavit in reply and stated that he came to Court on 24/10/05 at 9.00am with his witnesses. His affidavit does not state as to whether or not the defendants were present in Court in the morning. On the material before the Magistrates Court at the application to set aside default judgment, it is clear that (i) the Defendants were not in Ba Court on the morning default judgment was entered  for this is the very basis upon which the Court gave default judgment. It is equally clear that the Defendants were at Ba Magistrates Court on that morning  both from the Affidavit of the Second Defendant and that of the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff says he saw the Defendants whilst he was sitting outside the Magistrates Court & waiting for [his] case to be heard.  He states that he came all the way from New Zealand and waited for his case to be called and since the defendants lived in Ba he states that they should have done likewise. This may suggest that the defendants were in Court in the morning of 24/10/05: Court Record, pp. 24-25

4.      
Conditional Grant of Application to Set Aside

In granting conditionally the application to set aside the default judgment, the Magistrate said amongst other matters that the Defendants/Appellants in the Statement of Defence:

& has admitted owing the sum claimed and they have pleaded that a sum of $3,016.00 was paid in full and final settlement & This is [a] positive defence and the onus was on the defendant to prove the payment as the amount claimed was admitted by them and since the defendants did not appear and their counsel sought leave to withdraw for lack of instructions the Court in my view was correct in entering default judgment for the sum of $8,973.77 plus interest of $897.37.

I therefore hold that the judgment was regular &

4.1     
The Magistrate then added that in exercise of his discretion he was prepared to set [the judgment] aside to allow the defendants to defend this action on the following conditions:

(i)     
That a sum of $9,871.14 shall be paid in Court;
(ii)    
That since the plaintiff resides in New Zealand a sum of $800.00 shall be paid as his air fares;
(iii)   
I order that the above sums shall be paid within 21 days.

4.2     
Costs of the application summarily assessed in the sum of $250.00 were awarded to the Plaintiff: Court Record, pp. 25-26

5.      
Grounds of Appeal

The Appellants/Defendants Grounds of Appeal are:

1.      
The learned trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact in not setting aside the Judgment unconditionally when:-

(i)     
The Court when giving Judgment by default of appearance had no powers or jurisdiction to give Judgment by default as such without hearing evidence.

(ii)    
Order XXX of the Magistrates Court Rules required evidence to be called when a matter is listed for hearing and when acknowledgment of Service and Statement of Defence has been filed.

(iii)   
The Judgment given on 24 October 2005 was irregular and the Appellants had the right to have the same set aside as of right and accordingly no terms or conditions ought to have been imposed.

2.      
The learned trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact in justifying his ruling on the application to set aside Judgment by considering the contents of the Statement of Defence of the Appellants.

3.      
In any event the learned trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact [in] not properly and/or adequately and/or in proper context consider[ing] the Statement of Defence of the Appellants.

4.      
The learned trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact in taking irrelevant matters into account and not taking relevant matters into account when coming to his decision.

5.      
In any event no Order as to payment of $800.00 to the Respondent for his plane fare ought to have been made as the Respondent was not a witness at the hearing when Judgment was entered.

6.      
The decision of the learned trial Magistrate is unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to all the relevant circumstances of the matter.

6.      
Submissions for Defendants/Appellants and Plaintiff/Respondent

Counsel provided both written and oral submissions which were of considerable assistance to the Court.

6.1     
(a)     
Submissions for Defendants/Appellants: The Defendants/Appellants position is that the default judgment was entered irregularly for it did not comply with the requirements for judgments made in the absence of a party (in this case, the Defendants). Having filed and served a Notice of Appearance and Statement of Defence, the Defendants/Appellants say, there could be no judgment in default without the hearing of evidence. In the absence of hearing evidence, judgment is said to have been entered irregularly, the Magistrate having no jurisdiction to enter default judgment.

6.2     
In the face of default judgment entered irregularly, say the Defendants/Appellants, the Magistrates Court had no option but to set it aside as of right - without conditions.

6.3     
Further as to the setting aside, the Defendants/Appellants say the Magistrate was in error in considering part of the Statement of Defence and not other parts:

If he did find it necessary as a matter of discretion to refer to the Statement of Defence then he ought to have considered the whole of it. The Statement of Defence made it very clear that the full amount had been paid by [the Defendants/Appellants] but after going into accounts: Written Submissions, p. 5

6.4     
It is further said that the Court was not entitled to refer only to the admission of the sum owed without taking into account the context in which the admission was made that is, paid after going into account. In any event, say the Defendants/Appellants this reference to the Statement of Defence was completely irrelevant as judgment could not be entered without hearing evidence per Order XXX, Rule 3 of the Magistrates Court Rules. The failure to hear evidence at default judgment stage meant the procedure adopted by the Court [in the trial] was tantamount to giving evidence from the bar table: Written Submission, pp. 5-6

6.5     
Additionally, in setting aside default judgment, the finding by the Magistrate that the onus rested upon the Defendants/Appellants to prove their defence as it was a positive defence is challenged: 

& if there was [a] positive Defence then the Learned Trial Magistrate had to hear the evidence of the Plaintiff in that regard in any event. The question of who had the onus of proof at that stage was irrelevant.

In any event there was no admission made of owning the full amount for which Judgment was given. Only $3016.00 was admitted & after going through the accounts &: [and] the Statement of Defence & made this very clear: Written Submissions, p. 7

6.6     
Finally, say the Defendants/Appellants, there is no need for them to assert merit in order that the judgment be set aside, for it was entered irregularly. However, the Magistrate on the setting aside application saw merit in the application in that he set it aside, albeit on conditions: Written Submissions, p. 8

6.7     
In addition to the Magistrates Court Rules, the Defendants/Appellants rely principally upon Subodh Kumar Mishra v. Car Rentals (Pacific) Ltd [1985] 31 FLR 49; also referring to Ram Raji v. Audh Raji (1966) FLR 173; FSC Ltd v. Mohammed Ismail 34 FLR 75; Evans v. Bartlam (1937) 2 All ER 646; OShannessy v. Dasun Hair Designers Ltd (1980) 2 NZLR 652; Hayman v. Rowlands (1957) 1 All ER 321.

6.8     
(b)     
Submissions for Plaintiff/Respondent: The Plaintiff/Respondent says judgment was entered regularly, adverting to the principle that admissions in pleadings constitute evidence as allegations of fact not specifically denied or admitted and taken as established at the hearing. There was no need for oral evidence.

6.9     
The Plaintiff/Respondent relies on Magistrates Court Rules Order XVI, Rule 3:

"        
every allegation of fact, if not denied specifically or by necessary implication or stated to be not admitted, shall be taken as established at the hearing; and

"        
the answer shall admit such material allegations in the Statement of Claim as the Defendant knows to be true or desires to be taken as admitted, and such allegations may be taken as established without proof thereof,

this provide[s] for situations where facts either have been deemed to have been established or proven:

In that event such facts need not be established by way of oral evidence. It is already evidence adduced and proved: Written Submissions, paras [5]-[8]

6.10    
The Plaintiff/Respondent goes onto say that regularity of the default judgment is shown in that:

"        
the Defendants/Appellants in their Statement of Defence do not deny signing the agreement but claim under pressure or influence brought it about;

"        
they allege the sum of $3016.00 was to be paid and was subsequently paid;

"        
at the hearing evidence established that there was a Deed of 22 July 2003 under which a sum of $8973.77 plus interest was payable by the Defendants/Appellants to the Plaintiff/Respondent;

"        
the Defendants/Appellants counter alleged a lesser sum was payable outside the terms of the deed with the Magistrate correctly point[ing] out & that this was a positive defence [with] the onus & on the defendant to prove it;

"        
the Defendants/Appellants did not show up at the hearing & and did not even bother to instruct their lawyers &;

"        
when applying for setting aside the default judgment they did not even bother to adduce evidence by way of affidavit to prove their allegations &: Written Submissions, paras [9]-[15]

6.11    
Hence, says the Plaintiff/Respondent, the Magistrate was entitled to impose conditions and correctly did so, by reference to Subodh Kumar Mishra v. Car Rentals (Pacific) Ltd [1985] 31 FLR 49 Relied upon also by the Defendants/Appellants.

6.12    
Finally, says the Plaintiff/Respondent, the order for costs (challenged by the Defendants/Appellants) was correctly made because:

"        
the matter was set for trial and the Plaintiff required to come to Court;

"        
while the allegations were admitted the Plaintiff would nonetheless have had to answer the allegations raised by the defence;

"        
in the event, the defence did not show up and the plaintiff did not have to call evidence for all they wanted to say was deemed admitted and provide in court;

"        
the plaintiff had to come because the matter was set for trial and the costs order was correctly made: Written Submissions, paras [16]-[17]

6.13    
The Plaintiff/Respondent also relied upon a submission that the Defendants/Appellants had failed to establish that there were matters put before the Magistrate showing any merit in the defence so that the application should be dismissed with costs on that ground alone, relying upon Farden v. Richter (1889) 23 QBD 124; Hopton v. Robertson [1884] WN 77, reprinted 23 QBD 125(n); also Richardson v Howell (1883) 8 TLR 445 and Watt v. Barnett (1878) 3 QBD 183: Court Record, pp. 43-44

7.      
Magistrates Court Rules  Provision for Default Judgment

Entry on the record of judgment in default must have a proper foundation. The Magistrates Court Rules provide for entry of default judgment in particular circumstances. Unless the circumstances exist, the Court cannot enter judgment in default.

7.1     
Order III  Miscellaneous Provisions provides for application of the High Court Rules where there is no provision in the Magistrates Court Rules for the circumstances arising in any particular cause, matter, case or event. As provision in the High Court Rules for judgment in default are consistent with those in the Magistrates Court Rules, there is no room to call upon them to provide a foundation for default judgment if the Magistrates Court Rules provide no basis for the default judgment entered here.

7.2     
I turn then to the Magistrates Court Rules. 

7.3     
(a)     
Order VI  No Basis for Default Judgment: Order VI  Form and Commencement of Suit provides for an undefended suit to be disposed by default:

Filing of notice of intention to defend

6.      
If the party served with the writ of summons deliver to the clerk of the court, and serve on the plaintiff, not less than three days before the day fixed for hearing, a notice in writing that he intends to defend the suit, then and in such case the suit shall be entered for hearing on the aforesaid date for hearing.

Special leave to defend where foregoing rule not complied with

7.      
When any defendant neglects to deliver and serve the notice of defence as prescribed by rule 6, within the time limited by the said rule, the court may, at any time before judgment is entered, on the defendant disclosing a defence on the merits, let in the defendant to defend upon such terms as the court may think just.

Disposal of undefended suit

8.      
In the case of liquidated demands only, where any defendant neglects to deliver and serve the notice of defence prescribed by rule 6 within the time limited by the said rule, and is not let in to defend in accordance with the provisions of rule 7, then and in such case the plaintiff may enter final judgment against the defendant.

7.4     
Order VI does not apply in the present case. Here, there was no failure to give notice of intention to defend, nor any failure to file a Statement of Defence. Order VI could not have been relied upon by the Magistrate to enter default judgment, nor for setting it aside on conditions.

7.5     
(b)     
Order XV  No Basis for Default Judgment: Order XV  Admissions also provides for judgment to be entered, as follows:

Notice of admissions

1.      
Any party to a suit may give notice, by his own statement or otherwise, that he admits the truth of the whole or any part of the case stated or referred to in the writ of summons, statement or particulars of claim, defence or other statement of any other party.
Notice to admit &

2.      
Any party may call upon any other party to admit, saving just exceptions, any document or fact.

Costs on refusal to make reasonable admission

3.      
&
Admissions by defendants

4.      
If any defendant shall sign a statement admitting the amount claimed in the sums or any part of such amount, the court, on being satisfied as to the genuineness of the signature of the person before whom such statement was signed, and unless it sees good reason to the contrary, shall, in case the whole amount is admitted, or in case the plaintiff consents to a judgment for the part admitted, enter judgment for the plaintiff or the whole amount or the part admitted, as the case may be, and, in case the plaintiff shall not consent to judgment for the part admitted, shall receive such statement in evidence as an admission without further proof.

7.6     
The default judgment cannot have been entered in accordance with Order XV, for judgment was entered in the whole amount, not simply upon the part of that amount admitted. Hence, Order XV provides no basis for the default judgment.

7.7     
(c)     
Order XXX  Basis/No Basis for Default Judgment?: Does Order XXX  Non-Attendance of Parties at Hearing provide a basis for entry of default judgment? I briefly look at each aspect, for it indicates an endeavour to ensure that the Court operates in a fair and just manner, and not peremptorily, in the instance of non-appearance.

7.8     
Order XXX, Rule 1 provides for the case where neither party appears and the cause may be struck out. 

7.9     
Rule 2 provides for the instance of the Plaintiffs not appearing, providing three possible approaches:

"        
The cause may be struck out;
"        
If there is a counterclaim, it will not be struck out and the Court may make such order as to costs in favour of the Defendant appearing, as seems just;
"        
If the Defendant admits the cause of action to the full amount claimed, the Court may, if it thinks fit, give judgment as if the Plaintiff had appeared.

7.10    
Rule 4 deals with counterclaims when the Plaintiff does not appear, whilst the Defendant does:

Where the defendant to a cause which has been struck out under rule 2 has a counterclaim, the court may, on due proof of service on the plaintiff of notice thereof, proceed to hear the counterclaim and give judgment on the evidence adduced by the defendant, or may postpone the hearing of the counterclaim and direct notice of such postponement to be given to the plaintiff.

7.11    
Notably, evidence is required to be adduced by the Defendant for the judgment to be granted on the counterclaim. Further, there is a capacity in the Court to adjourn the hearing of the counterclaim so that the Plaintiff may be advised. 

7.12    
Rule 3 provides for the Defendants not appearing:

If the plaintiff appears, and the defendant does not appear or sufficiently excuse his absence, or neglects to answer when duly called, the court may, upon proof of service of the summons proceed to hear the cause and give judgment on the evidence adduced by the plaintiff, or may postpone the hearing of the cause and direct notice of such postponement to be given to the defendant.

7.13    
Here, the Rule replicates Rule 4, in that evidence is required to be adduced by the Plaintiff for judgment to be entered, and there is a capacity in the Court to postpone the hearing with notice being given to the Defendant.

7.14    
Rule 5 then provides for any judgment obtained against any party in their absence to be set aside at the discretion of the Court, on sufficient cause shown, and upon such terms as may seem fit. 

7.15    
The Plaintiff/Respondent relies upon the Courts capacity to enter judgment in default of the Defendants appearance. 

7.16    
However, Order XXX, Rule 3 can apply so as to make the default judgment regular only if it is accepted that the Court entered judgment on the basis of evidence consistent with the claim and the nature of the defence. The Plaintiff/Respondent relies upon Order XVI for this purpose.

7.17    
It is necessary therefore to go to Order XVI.

7.18    
(d)     
Order XVI  Basis/No Basis for Default Judgment?: Does Order XVI provide a basis for the default judgment when considered in conjunction with Order XXX?

7.19    
Order XVI deals with Pleadings.

7.20    
Rule 1 provides for suits to ordinarily be heard and determined in a summary manner without pleadings, and for the Court to order pleadings if required. In the present case, there being both a Statement of Claim and Statement of Defence, there was no question of hearing in a summary manner without pleadings.

7.21    
As to the Statement of Defence, Order XVI, Rule 3 provides amongst other paragraphs:

Defendants pleading to meet allegations in statement of claim

(e)     
The defendants pleading shall deny all such material allegations in the statement of claim as the defendant intends to deny at the hearing. Every allegation of fact, if not denied specifically or by necessary implication or stated to be not admitted, shall be taken as established at the hearing.

7.22    
The Defendants/Appellants having made admissions in the Statement of Defence, the Plaintiff/Respondent relies on these as evidence founding the default judgment and hence rendering it regular. The Plaintiff/Respondent calls upon Rule 3, paragraph (h) for this purpose:

Admissions: their effect

(h)     
The answer shall admit such material allegations in the statement of claim as the defendant knows to be true or desires to be taken as admitted, and such allegations may be taken as established without proof thereof.

7.23    
This means that the admissions made in the Statement of Defence may be classified as evidence, however, it is admissions alone that come into that category. If a Statement of Defence includes both admissions and denials, or calls for strict proof, or in some other way limits what can be said to be admissions as to the whole of the matters pleaded in the Statement of Claim, then Rule 3 (h) cannot be used to support judgment in default in the entirety of the claim. That is, the Statement of Defence would have to admit whole of the Statement of Claim, or at least the key aspects of it, for default judgment to be entered in the whole of the terms or amount claimed in the Statement of Claim.

7.24    
I turn, then, to the Statement of Defence.

8.      
Statement of Claim & Statement of Defence

To determine the extent of admissions in the Statement of Defence, its terms must be seen in conjunction with the terms of the Statement of Claim. Both are here set out in abbreviated form, noting that the Statement of Defence repeats its paragraphs 1-8 in response to both paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Statement of Claim:

Statement of Claim, para 1

Plaintiff claims from Defendants $8,973.77 owed by them to the Plaintiff plus interest at 10% per annum form 25 July 2003 pursuant to Deed of 22 July 2003 made by the Defendants in favour of the Plaintiff:

Principal amount due and owing  
$7,983.00
Interest at 10% 
$ 990.77

TOTAL

Judgment in Default versus Statement of Defence

As noted, judgment in default was granted in the whole of the sum claimed by the Plaintiff plus interest, namely $8,973.77 plus $897.37, plus (as it appears) interest at 10% from 22 October 2004 to 24 October 2005. Can it be said, however, that there was evidence before the Court upon which this judgment was based? 

9.1     
The only admission made as to the sum of money owing was the amount of $3016.00: Statement of Defence, paras 7 and 8

9.2     
Notably, the admission as to owing $3016.00 is followed by a claim that that sum was paid to the Plaintiff/Respondent. 

9.3     
Does this limited admission and its countering by the contention of having paid the sum admitted to constitute evidence sufficient to found the default judgment made in the full amount plus interest, plus the further interest ordered for the year 22 October 2004 to 24 October 2005?

9.4     
It appears to me that the answer has to be no.

9.5     
As an alternative, can it be said that there is an admission that the Deed was executed by the Defendants/Appellants so that this constitutes evidence that the whole of the monies was admitted by them to be owing?

9.6     
Certainly there is an admission as to execution of the Deed. However, the allegation is that its execution was secured by coercion or duress or representations that interfered with full and free consent or agreement, or its voluntary execution. There is then the admission as to a sum (as noted) below the whole of the amount claimed in the Statement of Claim.

9.7     
It does not appear to me that one can say there is evidence through admissions supporting default judgment for the whole of the amount.

9.8     
Even if it could be said that the onus was on the Defendants/Appellants to prove their contention in the Statement of Defence that they had paid the amount they admitted was owing, there would still be an absence of evidence through admissions as to the whole of the amount of the default judgment.

9.9     
Hence the conclusion must be that judgment in default was entered without evidence to sustain it. The onus was on the Plaintiff/Respondent to establish on his evidence that the whole of the sum said to be owing plus interest was due to him. He did not do this. 

9.10    
Evidence does not mean solely evidence given on oath or affirmation in person from the witness box. It can (as Order XVI provides) include admissions in the pleadings. It can include Affidavit evidence. But it must be there for judgment to be entered: otherwise, judgment cannot be entered  whether in favour of a Plaintiff or a Defendant, or against a Plaintiff or a Defendant. If the evidence is not there, or not there to sustain the judgment in full, then a judgment is entered irregularly.

9.11    
Hence, the Defendants/Appellants submission that judgment in default was entered irregularly must prevail.

10.     
Non-Appearance of Defendants/Appellants

Before turning to the authorities to determine what assistance they can provide, I address a further matter for consideration.

10.1    
I have earlier set out Order XXX, Rule 3 which provides for the Defendants not appearing. However, in all the circumstances here, it bears repeating:

If the plaintiff appears, and the defendant does not appear or sufficiently excuse his absence, or neglects to answer when duly called, the court may, upon proof of service of the summons proceed to hear the cause and give judgment on the evidence adduced by the plaintiff, or may postpone the hearing of the cause and direct notice of such postponement to be given to the defendant.

10.2    
Several matters are of concern:

"        
The Defendants were at Court on the date of the hearing  this is attested to not only by them, but by the Plaintiff;
"        
When the matter was called before the Magistrate on that date, the Solicitor who appeared properly sought the leave of the Court to withdraw as she had no instructions from the Defendants;
"        
This meant that the Defendants were unrepresented parties.

10.3    
Their being unrepresented, this meant, in turn, that the matter should have been called outside the Courtroom  the Defendants names should have been called. There is no indication on the Court Record that this was done. However, to comply with Order XXX, Rule 3, in my opinion that was the course that should have been followed.

10.4    
There is of course no assurance that the Defendants would have appeared, had they been called: on their own Affidavit in Support of the application to set aside default judgment, they had left the Court premises in the belief that the matter would be called midmorning rather than at 9.00am. However, once they were unrepresented, consistent with Order XXX this opportunity should have been provided.

10.5    
Further, the Court did not proceed to hear the cause. The Court heard only the evidence that could be seen to count as admissions. (And even those admissions were countered by the contention of the sum admitted being lower than the sum claimed, and the contention of its having been paid.) The Court did not hear the cause. Hearing the cause would, in this case, have required adverting not only to the pleadings and any admissions therein which the Court could fairly consider as admissions for the purpose of judgment in default of appearance, but hearing evidence from the Plaintiff as to the matters not admitted and indeed being contested. 

10.6    
It was up to the Plaintiff to prove his case. This he did not do  the Court in not requiring evidence over and above any admissions  did not apparently require it. In not requiring it, the requirements of the Magistrates Court Rules as to entering judgment in default of the Defendants appearance were not complied with.

10.7    
The allegations made in the Statement of Defence were serious. The Defendants should have made it their business to remain within the Court precincts until the case was called. They ought not to have taken themselves off. Some may consider it to have been foolish in the extreme not to seek out their Solicitor or wait until she made contact with them. At the same time, entering judgment in default of appearance in all the circumstances and without evidence given in support of the whole of the amount claimed and in relation to which judgment was entered meant judgment was entered irregularly.

11.     
The Authorities

The facts in Subodh Kuma Mishra v. Car Rentals (Pacific) Ltd [1985] 31 FLR 49 differ from those in the instant case. The Defendant had been ordered to file and serve a Statement of Defence, with the proceedings being adjourned to 7 March 1984 for that purpose. No Statement of Defence being filed or served by that date, the matter was further adjourned to 4 April 1984. on that date, still no Statement of Defence having been filed and served, judgment in default of defence was obtained by the Plaintiff in the sum set out in the Statement of Claim. 

11.1    
The Order under which judgment was obtained was XXXIV  Enforcement of Orders. Rule 3 provides:

Interlocutory orders may also be enforced according to the following provisions 

If a plaintiff in a suit makes default or fails in fulfilling any interlocutory order, the court may, if it thinks fit, stay further proceedings in the suit until the order is fulfilled, or may give a judgment of non-suit against such plaintiff, with or without liberty of bringing any other suit on the same grounds of action, or may make such other order on such terms as to the court shall seem fit.

If a defendant in any suit makes such default or failure, the court may give judgment by default against such defendant, or make such other order as to the court may seem just:
Provided that any such judgment by default may be set aside by the court, upon such terms as to costs or otherwise as the court may think fit.

11.2    
The judgment in Mishra v. Car Rentals rested upon the basis that the Defendant had failed to comply with an interlocutory order. It was held that not only was the Court empowered to exercise its discretion to enter judgment, but this followed whether the claim was liquidated or unliquidated and even where the action was in tort.

11.3    
This was not the case here. 

11.4    
Further, I observe that in Mishra v. Car Rentals in the absence of any Statement of Defence, the whole of the Statement of Claim is taken to be admitted. Again, this was not the case here.

11.5    
Mishra v. Car Rentals does, however, support the proposition that where judgment is entered irregularly, the party against whom it is entered has a right to have it set aside, rather than its being a matter of discretion. The Court relied for the distinction upon Anlaby v. Praetorious (1888) 20 QBD 764; 57 LJQB 287; 58 LT 671:

There is a strong distinction between setting aside a judgment for irregularity, in which case the Court has no discretion to refuse to set it aside, and setting it aside where the judgment though regular, has been obtained through some slip or error on the part of the defendant in which case the Court has a discretion to impose terms as a condition of granting the defendant relief: at 769, per Fry LJ, at 52-53

11.6    
It may be argued in the present case that judgment was obtained through some slip or error on the part of the defendant  because the Defendants/Appellants failed to appear due to a slip up in their understanding of Court listings. However, that does not follow, for the problem confronting the Plaintiff/Respondent here is that the default judgment was obtained inconsistently with the Rules. Hence, it was irregular.

11.7    
As was said, again, in Mishra v. Car Rentals:

& if the judgment was obtained irregularly &. The appellant was entitled to have it set aside ex debita justitiae, but, if regularly, the Court was obliged to act within the framework of the empowering provision  in this case  the provision to Order XXXIV, r. 3 which confers an unfettered discretion upon the Court: at 53

11.8    
The Court then went on to consider Order XXX, Rule 3:

& which provides that if the plaintiff appears at the hearing and the defendant does not appear or sufficiently excuse his absence, or neglects to answer when duly called, the Court may, upon proof of service of the summons proceed to hear the case and give judgment on the evidence adduced by the plaintiff &

The underlining is ours.

So, in the instant case, if the appellant had not appeared at the hearing and judgment was entered without the hearing of the evidence both as to liability in negligence and of the special damages claimed, such judgment would have been also given irregularly with the consequences previously outlined: at 53

11.9    
Further support for the proposition that an irregularity means default judgment should be set aside as of right lies in Craig v. Kanseen [1943] 1 All ER 108. There, the English Court of Appeal discussed amongst other matters the question of judgments entered irregularly. The Court cited a number of authorities and jurisprudential sources, then adverted to Hughes v. Justin [1894] 1 QB 667; 63 LJQB 417; 70 LT 365 which has similarities with what is alleged in the present matter:

There, after the issue of the writ, the parties had come to some sort of an agreement as a result of which a payment was made. In spite of that, judgment was signed for the full amount claimed. It was held that the case fell within the class of case referred to in Anlaby v. Praetorius and was one where the defendant had a right ex debito justitiae to have the judgment set aside: at 112

11.10   
Albeit no Reply has been filed in respect of the Statement of Defence, there is clearly a dispute in the present case as to whether any agreement was arrived at as the Defendants/Appellants say, and whether any monies have been paid. However, this simply supports the proposition that the judgment as entered could not have been entered other than irregularly where the evidence before the Court did not support the whole of the judgment amount. Hence, upon the authorities the judgment should be set aside as of right.

12.     
Costs

Costs were awarded to the Plaintiff/Respondent by the Magistrate when judgment in default of the Defendants/Appellants was entered. Costs were also awarded to the Plaintiff/Respondent by the Magistrate in the application to have that judgment set aside. In addition, the Magistrate at that time awarded the sum of $800.00 to cover the Plaintiff/Respondents airfares as he traveled from Aotearoa/New Zealand for the hearing. 

12.1    
Had the Defendants/Appellants not absented themselves from the Court precincts on 24 October 2005 then presumably the matter would have been heard and determined upon on that day, in accordance with their evidence and that of the Plaintiff/Respondent. in the action Albeit I have had that the judgment was entered irregularly, the absence of the Defendants was at least in part responsible for what happened on that day.

12.2    
The Defendants/Appellants have been successful in their appeal in this Court. In all the circumstances, however, I do not consider it appropriate to make an order for costs. 

13.     
Final Matter

A perusal of the Court Record reveals the sealed Orders made by the Magistrate on 10 September 2007 in respect of the application to have the judgment of 24 October 2005 set aside as being by consent:

UPON READING the Notice of Motion dated 26th October 2005 and the Affidavit of Sarjit Singh sworn on the 26th day of October 2005 and the Affidavit of Pargan Singh sworn on the 21st day of November 2005 and upon reading the Submissions filed herein;

AND UPON HEARING Mr Peni W. Dalituicama of Counsel for the Plaintiff and Dr MS Sahu Khan of Counsel for the Defendant;

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED BY CONSENT:-

1.      
That the judgment entered is set aside to allow the Defendants to defend this action on the following considerations:-

(i)     
That the sum of $9,871.14 (nine thousand eight hundred seventy one dollars and fourteen cents) shall be paid in Court.

(ii)    
That since the plaintiff resides in New Zealand a sum of $800.00 (eight hundred dollars ) shall be paid as his air fares.

(iii)   
The above sums shall be paid within 21 days.

2.      
It is further ordered that the plaintiff shall be entitled to the costs of this application which is summarily assessed in the sum of $250.00 (two hundred and fifty dollars).

DATED this 24th day of September 2007: Court Record, p. 62.

13.1    
At the appeal, no adversion was made by Counsel to these Orders and no oral or written submissions were advanced in relation to them. 

13.2    
I have therefore not taken into account the proposition that the orders herein appealed against were by consent. In any event, it appears to me that this must be an error for the application to set aside default judgment was the subject of oral and written submissions, and the Court Record indicates it was vigorously agitated. In that circumstance it appears unlikely that the orders were made by consent. The judgment does not record any by consent orders: to the contrary, the orders arise directly out of the Magistrates judgment. 

14.     
Note on Orders

The Orders made herein are directed to ensuring that the Magistrates Court hears the proceeding as expeditiously as possible. It is understood that the Magistrates Court at Ba is currently without a Resident Magistrate. That being so, the Orders are made to ensure that the matter proceeds in Lautoka if Ba Magistrates Court is for that reason unable to expedite the proceeding.

Orders

1.      
The judgment of 24 October 2005 is set aside.

2.      
The judgment of 10 September 2007 is set aside.

3.      
The matter to be remitted to the Magistrates Court in Ba or Lautoka for hearing as soon as expediently possible.

4.      
To this end, the matter is to be listed for mention on Monday 11 August 2008 at 9.30am:

a)      
in Ba if a Magistrate is sitting at Ba Magistrates Court on that day;
b)      
in Lautoka if no Magistrate is sitting at Ba Magistrates Court on that day.

5.      
The parties are to undertake to act with all expedition so that Order 3 is able to be complied with.

6.      
No order as to costs.
