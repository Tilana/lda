Please find attached an Appendix 3B notice notifying the issue today of equity incentives 
under Origin’s Equity Incentive Plan.  
  
Separately from the above issue, and as previously foreshadowed in our announcements 
on 18 August 2016, it is proposed that Mr Grant King, Managing Director, be granted equity 
incentives  to  the  value  of  $1,350,000  which  represents  his  allocation  of  Long-Term 
Incentives  (LTIs)  under  Origin’s  Equity  Incentive  Plan  for  FY2016.  This  proposal  will  be 
submitted to shareholders for approval at the 2016 Annual General Meeting (AGM). 
  
As disclosed in the Remuneration Report, the Board has decided that Mr King’s LTIs be 
delivered  by  value  half  in  Options  and  half  in  Performance  Share  Rights  (PSRs).  The 
method to calculate the exercise price and allocation value of the Options and PSRs is set 
out in the Remuneration Report. The precise number of Options and PSRs to be awarded 
to  Mr  King  will  not  be  determined  until  around  late  September  or  early  October.  The 
Company will issue an ASX announcement confirming the number of Options and PSRs to 
be granted to Mr King, and the exercise price of the Options, as soon as practicable after 
calculations are made (prior to the close of voting on the AGM resolutions).

The issue of the +securities to be quoted complies with the law and is not for 
an illegal purpose.
There is no reason why those +securities should not be granted +quotation.
An offer of the +securities for sale within 12 months after their issue will not

Corporations Act.

If  we  are  a  trust,  we  warrant  that  no  person  has  the  right  to  return  the 
+securities to be quoted under section 1019B of the Corporations Act at the
