<p><b>Human Rights Council 
</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Resolution 7/19.   Combating defamation of religions 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the 2005 World Summit Outcome adopted by the General Assembly 
</p>
<p>in its resolution 60/1 of 24 October 2005, in which the Assembly emphasized the 
</p>
<p>responsibilities of all States, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations, to 
</p>
<p>respect human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction of any 
</p>
<p>kind as to race, colour, sex, language or religion, political or other opinion, national or 
</p>
<p>social origin, property, birth or other status, and acknowledged the importance of 
</p>
<p>respect and understanding for religious and cultural diversity throughout the world, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted by 
</p>
<p>the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and 
</p>
<p>Related Intolerance in September 2001 (A/CONF.189/12 and Corr.1, chap. I), 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling further</i> the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, proclaimed by the 
</p>
<p>General Assembly in its resolution 36/55 of 25 November 1981, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>the valuable contribution of all religions to modern civilization 
</p>
<p>and the contribution that dialogue among civilizations can make to an improved 
</p>
<p>awareness and understanding of the common values shared by all humankind, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>the Declaration adopted by the Islamic Conference of Foreign 
</p>
<p>Ministers at its thirty-fourth session in Islamabad, in May 2007, which condemned the 
</p>
<p>growing trend of Islamophobia and systematic discrimination against the adherents of 
</p>
<p>Islam and emphasized the need to take effective measures to combat defamation of 
</p>
<p>religions,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i> Noting also </i>the final communiqu&#233; adopted by the Organization of the Islamic 
</p>
<p>Conference at its eleventh summit, in Dakar, in March 2008, in which the 
</p>
<p>Organization expressed concern at the systematically negative stereotyping of </p>

<p>Muslims and Islam and other divine religions, and denounced the overall rise in 
</p>
<p>intolerance and discrimination against Muslim minorities, which constitute an affront 
</p>
<p>to human dignity and run counter to the international human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the joint statement of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, 
</p>
<p>the European Union and the Secretary-General of 7 February 2006, in which they 
</p>
<p>recognized the need, in all societies, to show sensitivity and responsibility in treating 
</p>
<p>issues of special significance for the adherents of any particular faith, even by those 
</p>
<p>who do not share the belief in question, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the call made by the President of the General Assembly in his 
</p>
<p>statement of 15 March 2006 that, in the wake of existing mistrust and tensions, there 
</p>
<p>is a need for dialogue and understanding among civilizations, cultures and religions to 
</p>
<p>commit to working together to prevent provocative or regrettable incidents and to 
</p>
<p>develop better ways of promoting tolerance, respect for and freedom of religion and 
</p>
<p>belief, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming </i>all international and regional initiatives to promote cross-cultural 
</p>
<p>and interfaith harmony, including the Alliance of Civilizations and the International 
</p>
<p>Dialogue on Interfaith Cooperation and their valuable efforts towards the promotion 
</p>
<p>of a culture of peace and dialogue at all levels, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming also </i>the report by the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms 
</p>
<p>of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance on the situation of 
</p>
<p>Muslims and Arabs in various parts of the world (E/CN.4/2006/17), 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming further </i>the reports of the Special Rapporteur submitted to the 
</p>
<p>Council at its fourth and sixth sessions (A/HRC/4/19 and A/HRC/6/6), in which he 
</p>
<p>draws the attention of Member States to the serious nature of the defamation of all 
</p>
<p>religions and to the promotion of the fight against these phenomena by strengthening 
</p>
<p>the role of interreligious and intercultural dialogue and promoting reciprocal 
</p>
<p>understanding and joint action to meet the fundamental challenges of development, 
</p>
<p>peace and the protection and promotion of human rights, as well as the need to 
</p>
<p>complement legal strategies, </p>

<p><i> Reiterating </i>the call made by the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of 
</p>
<p>racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance to Member States to 
</p>
<p>wage a systematic campaign against incitement to racial and religious hatred by 
</p>
<p>maintaining a careful balance between the defence of secularism and respect for 
</p>
<p>freedom of religion and by acknowledging and respecting the complementarity of all 
</p>
<p>the freedoms embodied in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing </i>that States, non-governmental organizations, religious bodies and 
</p>
<p>the media have an important role to play in promoting tolerance and freedom of 
</p>
<p>religion and belief through education, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting with concern </i>that defamation of religions is among the causes of social 
</p>
<p>disharmony and instability, at the national and international levels, and leads to 
</p>
<p>violations of human rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting with deep concern </i>the increasing trend in recent years of statements 
</p>
<p>attacking religions, including Islam and Muslims, in human rights forums, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Expresses deep concern </i>at the negative stereotyping of all<b> </b>religions 
</p>
<p>and manifestations of intolerance and discrimination in matters of religion or belief; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also expresses deep concern </i>at attempts to identify Islam with 
</p>
<p>terrorism, violence and human rights violations and emphasizes that equating any 
</p>
<p>religion with terrorism should be rejected and combated by all at all levels; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Further expresses deep concern </i>at the intensification of the campaign 
</p>
<p>of defamation of religions and the ethnic and religious profiling of Muslim minorities 
</p>
<p>in the aftermath of the tragic events of 11 September 2001; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Expresses its grave concern</i> at the recent serious instances of deliberate 
</p>
<p>stereotyping of religions, their adherents and sacred persons in the media and by 
</p>
<p>political parties and groups in some societies, and at the associated provocation and 
</p>
<p>political exploitation; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Recognizes </i>that, in the context of the fight against terrorism, 
</p>
<p>defamation of religions becomes an aggravating factor that contributes to the denial of </p>

<p>fundamental rights and freedoms of target groups and their economic and social 
</p>
<p>exclusion; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Expresses concern </i>at laws or administrative measures that have been 
</p>
<p>specifically designed to control and monitor Muslim minorities, thereby stigmatizing 
</p>
<p>them and legitimizing the discrimination that they experience; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Strongly deplores </i>physical attacks and assaults on businesses, cultural 
</p>
<p>centres and places of worship of all religions and targeting of religious symbols; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Urges </i>States to take actions to prohibit the dissemination, including 
</p>
<p>through political institutions and organizations, of racist and xenophobic ideas and 
</p>
<p>material aimed at any religion or its followers that constitute incitement to racial and 
</p>
<p>religious hatred, hostility or violence; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Also urges </i>States to provide, within their respective legal and 
</p>
<p>constitutional systems, adequate protection against acts of hatred, discrimination, 
</p>
<p>intimidation and coercion resulting from the defamation of any religion, to take all 
</p>
<p>possible measures to promote tolerance and respect for all religions and their value 
</p>
<p>systems and to complement legal systems with intellectual and moral strategies to 
</p>
<p>combat religious hatred and intolerance; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Emphasizes</i> that respect of religions and their protection from contempt 
</p>
<p>is an essential element conducive for the exercise by all of the right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>thought, conscience and religion; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Urges </i>all States to ensure that all public officials, including members 
</p>
<p>of law enforcement bodies, the military, civil servants and educators, in the course of 
</p>
<p>their official duties, respect all religions and beliefs and do not discriminate against 
</p>
<p>persons on the grounds of their religion or belief, and that all necessary and 
</p>
<p>appropriate education or training is provided; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Emphasizes </i>that, as stipulated in international human rights law, 
</p>
<p>everyone has the right to freedom of expression, and that the exercise of this right 
</p>
<p>carries with it special duties and responsibilities, and may therefore be subject to 
</p>
<p>certain restrictions, but only those provided by law and necessary for the respect of </p>

<p>the rights or reputations of others, or for the protection of national security or of 
</p>
<p>public order, or of public health or morals; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Reaffirms </i>that general comment No. 15 of the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of Racial Discrimination, in which the Committee stipulates that the 
</p>
<p>prohibition of the dissemination of all ideas based upon racial superiority or hatred is 
</p>
<p>compatible with the freedom of opinion and expression, is equally applicable to the 
</p>
<p>question of incitement to religious hatred; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Deplores </i>the use of printed, audio-visual and electronic media, 
</p>
<p>including the Internet, and of any other means to incite acts of violence, xenophobia 
</p>
<p>or related intolerance and discrimination towards Islam or any religion; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Invites </i>the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance to continue to report on all 
</p>
<p>manifestations of defamation of religions, and in particular on the serious implications 
</p>
<p>of Islamophobia, on the enjoyment of all rights to the Council at its ninth session; 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Requests </i>the High Commissioner for Human Rights to report on the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the present resolution and to submit a study compiling relevant 
</p>
<p>existing legislations and jurisprudence concerning defamation of and contempt for 
</p>
<p>religions to the Council at its ninth session.
