Consolidated Results Q2 2016
2. ANALYSIS OF RESULTS FOR Q2 2016
Revenues for Q2 2016 were Ps 52.8 billion, 31.9% higher than Q2 2015, due primarily to the following factors:
•
Diesel revenues increased Ps 4.4 billion, due to a 38.5% increase in diesel mix prices against a 6.0% decrease in sales
volumes.
•
•
•
•
Gasoline revenues increased Ps 3.0 billion, due to a 42.5% increase in average prices against a 4.4% decrease in sales
volumes.
Natural gas revenues increased Ps 3.3 billion, due to a 59.0% increase in prices in Argentine peso terms and no significant
difference in sales volumes.
Fuel oil revenues increased Ps 0.7 billion, due to a 43.9% increase in prices in Argentine pesos against an 8.8% decrease in
sales volumes.
Exports of flour, oil and grains increased Ps 0.4 billion, due to a 77.0% increase in prices in Argentine pesos against a 26.0%
decrease in sales volumes.
•
In Q2 2015, Ps 0.6 billion was accrued due to the Crude Oil Production Stimulus Program.
Cost of sales for Q2 2016 was Ps 42.8 billion, 40.6% higher than Q2 2015. This includes a 49.9% increase in production costs and a
40.3% increase in purchases. This increase was driven by the following factors:
a) Costs of production:
•
Depreciation of fixed assets increased Ps 4.6 billion, an increase of 73.0%, due to increased investments in assets and
appreciation in 2016 based on their valuation in U.S. dollars, which is the functional currency of the company.
•
Lifting costs increased Ps 2.0 billion, reflecting a 26.8% increase in the unit indicator in Argentine peso terms.
•
•
Production costs related to refining increased Ps 0.8 billion, reflecting a 67.0% increase in the unit indicator in Argentine peso
terms.
Royalty increased Ps 1.0 billion. Of this increase, Ps 0.6 billion was related to an increase in royalties for crude oil production
and Ps 0.4 billion was related to an increase in royalties for natural gas production.
•
Transportation costs increased Ps 0.5 billion, mainly due to increases in rates produced during 2016.

b) Purchases:
4
Consolidated Results Q2 2016
•
•
FAME and ethanol biofuel purchases increased Ps 1.4 billion, due to higher prices for FAME and ethanol biofuel, a 5.0%
increase in volumes purchased of FAME and a 1.0% increase in volumes purchased of ethanol biofuel.
Grain purchases in the agricultural sales segment through the form of barter increased Ps 0.7 billion due to higher prices in
Argentine peso terms, which was partially offset by lower volumes purchased.
•
•
Crude oil purchases from third parties increased Ps 0.4 billion, due to a 32.1% increase in the Argentine peso purchase price
against a 14.6% decrease in volumes purchased.
Imports of diesel and jet fuel decreased Ps 46 million, due to lower volumes purchased of diesel, which was partially offset by
greater volumes purchased of jet fuel and higher prices for both in Argentine peso terms.
Administration expenses for Q2 2016 were Ps 1.8 billion, 35.0% higher than Q2 2015. The increase was principally due to higher
personnel expenses and higher IT costs.
Selling expenses for Q2 2016 were Ps 3.7 billion, 28.2% higher than Q2 2015. This was driven primarily by increases in transport
expenses, principally due to higher rates paid for domestic transport of fuels and increases in personnel costs, fixed asset depreciation
and service contracts.
Exploration expenses for Q2 2016 were Ps 0.7 billion, an increase of 90.7%, compared to Ps 0.4 billion for Q2 2015.
Other operating results, net, for Q2 2016 were a gain of Ps 1.6 billion, compared to a gain of Ps 0.7 billion for Q2 2015. This change
included a net gain of Ps 1.5 billion generated by the deconsolidation of Maxus Energy Corporation, Tierra Solutions Inc., Maxus
International Energy Company, Maxus (US) Exploration and Gateway Coal Company (collectively, the “Maxus Entities”), and the
temporary economic assistance of Ps 0.4 billion received in Q2 2015 by the company’s subsidiary, MetroGAS S.A.
Financial results for Q2 2016 were a loss of Ps 4.7 billion, compared to a loss of Ps 0.9 billion for Q2 2015. This change was driven
primarily by lower positive effects of foreign exchange rates on net liabilities in Argentine pesos of Ps 1.2 billion, generated by a lower
devaluation of the Argentine peso in Q2 2016 compared to Q2 2015. Interest expenses also increased Ps 2.1 billion, due to increased
levels of debt and higher interest rates.
Income tax for Q2 2016 was Ps 1.6 billion, including a re-estimate of the effective tax rate used in Q1 2016 by Ps 0.8 billion. This was
due primarily to a decrease in deferred tax expenses of Ps 0.9 billion, which was partially offset by an increase in current income tax of
Ps 45 million.
Net income for Q2 2016 was a loss of Ps 0.7 billion, 132.8% lower than Q2 2015.
Capital expenditures in fixed assets for Q2 2016 were Ps 14.5 billion, 1.8% higher than Q2 2015.

Consolidated Results Q2 2016
•
Exports increased Ps 0.5 billion, or 14.4%, compared to Q2 2015, due to higher prices in Argentine peso terms driven by
greater devaluation of the Argentine peso in Q2 2016, against a decrease in export volumes. Exports of flour, oil and grains
reached Ps 1.7 billion, due to a 77.2% increase in prices in Argentine peso terms, against a 25.6% decrease in export
volumes.
Cost of sales and operating expenses for Q2 2016 increased Ps 12.4 billion, or 39.0% compared to Q2 2015, due primarily to the
following factors:
•
•
•
•
•
Crude oil purchases increased Ps 6.2 billion, due to an increase in prices in Argentine peso terms of crude oil purchased and
no significant difference in volumes purchased. Purchase prices from the Upstream business segment in Argentine peso
terms increased 40.5%, and purchase prices from other producers of crude oil similarly increased 32.1%, due to the fact that
lower volumes were purchased from third parties corresponding exclusively to light crude oil, which has a higher price.
FAME and ethanol biofuel purchases increased Ps 1.4 billion, due to higher FAME and ethanol biofuel prices and a 5.0 %
increase in volumes purchased of FAME and a 1.0% increase in volumes purchased of ethanol biofuel.
Grain purchases in the agricultural sales segment through the form of barter increased Ps 0.7 billion due to higher prices in
Argentine peso terms, which was partially offset by lower volumes purchased.
Diesel and jet fuel imports decreased Ps 46 million, due to lower volumes purchased of diesel, which was partially offset by
higher volumes purchased of jet fuel and higher prices for both in Argentine peso terms.
Production costs related to refining increased Ps 0.8 billion, due to inflation and increased expenses for materials, parts,
electricity, other supplies and fuel, including scheduled plant shutdowns. As a result, and considering the 5.3% decrease in
volumes processed, unit refining costs in Q2 2016 were 67.0% higher than Q2 2015.
•
Fixed asset depreciation increased Ps 0.6 billion.
•
Marketing expenses increased Ps 0.8 billion, due to higher transportation costs related to an increase in domestic Argentine
fuel transportation rates and increased depreciation costs.
The volume of crude oil processed in Q2 2016 was 288 Kbbld, 5.3% lower than Q2 2015, mainly due to the scheduled shutdown of
various units at the La Plata and Plaza Huincul refineries from March 2016 to June 2016.
CAPEX
Cumulative capital expenditures for the Downstream business segment for Q2 2016 were Ps 2.8 billion, a 38.2% increase compared to

facilities and optimize safety and environmental performance has continued.
3.3 CORPORATE AND OTHERS
This business segment involves mainly corporate costs and other activities that are not reported in any of the previously-mentioned
business segments.
Corporate operating income for Q2 2016 was a gain of Ps 0.6 billion, compared to a loss of Ps 0.5 billion in Q2 2015. This change was
driven primarily by the net gain of Ps 1.5 billion generated by the deconsolidation of the Maxus Entities. As a result of the Maxus Entities’
filing for reorganization proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Court has a significant role in
approving substantial transactions, thus curtailing YPF’s ability to unilaterally make decisions on behalf of the Maxus Entities relating to
their operations or results.
Consolidation adjustments to eliminate results among business segments not transferred to third parties were negative Ps 0.4 billion in
Q2 2016, due to the widening gap between prices for transfers between business segments and replacement costs for the company’s
inventory. These adjustments were negative Ps 0.3 billion in Q2 2015 because the aforementioned price gap was similar during that
period.
3.4 RELATED COMPANIES
Results from related companies for Q2 2016 were a gain of Ps 166 million, compared to a gain of Ps 54 million for Q2 2015. This change
was primarily due to improved results from Compañía Mega, Refinor and Profertil.
4. LIQUIDITY AND SOURCES OF CAPITAL
Net cash flows provided by operating activities for Q2 2016 were Ps 6.6 billion, 33.9% lower than Q2 2015. This decrease of Ps 3.4
billion was driven by Ps 1.7 billion of insurance collections received in Q2 2015 for lost profits related to the incident at our La Plata
refinery, despite a Ps 4.8 billion increase in Q2 2016 in adjusted EBITDA due to an increase in working capital. This increase in working
capital was due to an accrual of accounts receivable, including accrual from the program to stimulate the injection of surplus natural gas
and sales to distribution companies.
Net cash flows directed to investing activities were Ps 14.4 billion for Q2 2016, or 6.6% lower than Q2 2015. Investments in fixed and
intangible assets were 0.4% higher than Q2 2015.
The previously discussed cash flow generation, together with a net decrease of Ps 2.3 MM from financing activities, contributed to a Ps
15.9 billion cash and cash equivalent position as of June 30, 2016. The main debt issuances in Q2 2016 consisted of two new series of
negotiable obligations for a total of Ps 0.5 billion and US$46 million. Total debt in U.S. dollars was US$9.3 billion, net debt was US$8.2
billion and the net debt/EBITDA LTM(1) ratio was 1.76x.

NOTE: The calculation of the main financial figures in U.S. dollars is derived from the calculation of the financial results
expressed in Argentine pesos using the average exchange rate for each period.
Adjusted EBITDA = Net income attributable to shareholders + Net income (loss) for non-controlling interest - Deferred income tax -
Income tax - Financial income (losses) gains on liabilities - Financial income gains (losses) on assets - Income on investments in
companies + Depreciation of fixed assets + Amortization of intangible assets + Unproductive exploratory drillings.

Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
These forward-looking statements may include statements regarding the intent, belief, plans, current expectations or objectives
as of the date hereof of YPF and its management, including statements with respect to trends affecting YPF’s future financial
condition, financial, operating, reserve replacement and other ratios, results of operations, business strategy, geographic
concentration, business concentration, production and marketed volumes and reserves, as well as YPF’s plans, expectations
or objectives with respect to future capital expenditures, investments, expansion and other projects, exploration activities,
ownership interests, divestments, cost savings and dividend payout policies. These forward-looking statements may also
include assumptions regarding future economic and other conditions, such as the future price of petroleum and petroleum
products, refining and marketing margins and exchange rates. These statements are not guarantees of future performance,
prices, margins, exchange rates or other events and are subject to material risks, uncertainties, changes in circumstances and
other factors that may be beyond YPF’s control or may be difficult to predict.
YPF’s actual future financial condition, financial, operating, reserve replacement and other ratios, results of operations,
business strategy, geographic concentration, business concentration, production and marketed volumes, reserves, capital
expenditures, investments, expansion and other projects, exploration activities, ownership interests, divestments, cost savings
and dividend payout policies, as well as actual future economic and other conditions, such as the future price of petroleum and
petroleum products, refining margins and exchange rates, could differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such
forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause such differences include, but are not limited to fluctuations in
the price of petroleum and petroleum products, supply and demand levels, currency fluctuations, exploration, drilling and
production results, changes in reserves estimates, success in partnering with third parties, loss of market share, industry
competition, environmental risks, physical risks, the risks of doing business in developing countries, legislative, tax, legal and
regulatory developments, economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions, political risks, wars and
acts of terrorism, natural disasters, project delays or advancements and lack of approvals, as well as those factors described in
the filings made by YPF and its affiliates before the Comisión Nacional de Valores in Argentina and with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, in particular, those described in “Item 3. Key Information–Risk Factors” and “Item 5. Operating and
Financial Review and Prospects” in YPF’s Annual Report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. In light of the foregoing, the forward-looking statements included in this document
may not occur.
Except as required by law, YPF does not undertake to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements even if
experience or future changes make it clear that the projected performance, conditions or events expressed or implied therein
will not be realized.
These materials do not constitute an offer for sale of YPF S.A. bonds, shares or ADRs in the United States or elsewhere.
The information contained herein has been prepared to assist interested parties in making their own evaluations of YPF.
