dispersion and lack of coordination. The Presidential Human Rights Commission and the 
Peace Secretary maintained structures and functions created on the basis of the armed 
conflict, which did not adequately coordinate with human rights offices within other 
ministries and secretaries. The Government was committed, and had assumed a pledge 
before the Human Rights Council to the effect, to redesigning the human rights institutional 
system of Guatemala. In that regard, it had requested assistance from OHCHR-Guatemala.

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its fourteenth session from 
22 October to 5 November 2012. The review of Guatemala was held at the 6th meeting, 
held on 24 October 2012. The delegation of Guatemala was headed by the Secretary of 
Peace and the President of the Presidential Human Rights Commission, Antonio Arenales 
Forno. At its 12th meeting held on 29 November 2012, the Working Group adopted the 
report on Guatemala. 
</p>
<p>2. On 3 May 2012, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Guatemala: Czech Republic, Jordan and 
Senegal. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
Guatemala: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.<footnote name="6">9. Italy commended accession to the Rome Statute and welcomed the death penalty 
moratorium, asking if Guatemala intended to abolish it and accede to ICCPR-OP2. Italy 
recognized progress on child labour; strong legislation addressing violence against women, 
asking about Guatemalan intentions to support related investigations; and regional bureaus </footnote>/14/GTM/1); 
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.<footnote name="6">8. Ireland welcomed the Law against Femicide and Other Forms of Violence against 
Women and the establishment of special courts in that respect, but remained concerned at 
high levels of violence against women. It was concerned about reports that indigenous 
populations had been removed from their land without prior consultation and that protesters 
had been ill-treated. Ireland made recommendations. 
</footnote>/14/GTM/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.<footnote name="6">7. Iraq commended the election of a woman president for the first time and attempts to 
improve the standard of living without discrimination. Iraq welcomed the adoption of 
conventions. It enquired about the mechanisms to combat gender violence and human 
trafficking. Iraq made recommendations. 
</footnote>/14/GTM/3 and Corr.<footnote name="1">3. The judicial processes that had been initiated to challenge the amnesty, prevented or 
made it impossible to carry out investigations and record testimonies. The historical truth 
needed to be reached in order that adequate reparation could be granted and reconciliation 
reached. The Government expected the superior courts of Guatemala to settle the debate on 
the legal effects and scope of the amnesty soon, in order to facilitate reconciliation 
processes. 
</footnote>). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Czech Republic, Hungary, Ireland, 
Finland, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia and the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Guatemala through the troika. These 
questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). The replies 
of Guatemala are also available on the extranet of UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The National Report of Guatemala was introduced by the Secretary of Peace and 
President of the Presidential Human Rights Commission, Antonio Arenales Forno. 
</p>
<p>6. Guatemala stated that the State&#8217;s review required awareness of what the State was 
and where it came from. Guatemala was in its initial phase of building a democratic State 
based on the rule of law. Even though Guatemala had been independent for 191 years, 
transitional democracy had started only 27 years previously and the armed conflict that had 
lasted 36 years had ended only 16 years previously. 
</p>
<p>7. Guatemala was satisfied with the important achievements made during the short 
period of 16 years of peace and democracy, despite its lack of tradition, experience and 
democratic institutions. It was experiencing its longest period of democracy. 
</p>
<p>8. Guatemala was part of indigenous Latin America, different to the Euro-descendants 
or the mestizo Latin Americas. Due to its multi-ethnic, multicultural and multilingual 
characteristics, it required deep reforms. The current legal and institutional order, created in 
the early years of independence, did not correspond to those characteristics, and results in </p>


<p>discrimination and exclusion. Those Guatemalan realities, disregarded by some States and 
by some Guatemalans people, were the guiding framework of the three national pacts, 
which prioritized the Government&#8217;s objectives, and of the proposed legal and institutional 
reform, which included a constitutional reform that incorporated fundamental changes, 
necessary for a new Guatemala, democratic and inclusive. Two reforms derived from the 
peace agreements. The first one referred to the multi-ethnic, multicultural and multilingual 
character of the nation, recognizing the identity as peoples of indigenous nationals and their 
related rights, such as the recognition of their languages as official languages, thus enabling 
the end of discrimination and exclusion. The second reform was aimed at establishing 
limitations to the Army&#8217;s functions in internal security, as temporary and extraordinary 
</p>
<p>support to the civilian Security Forces, under the command of the civil authority. The Army 
would submit a report to the civil authority at the end of the mission. 
</p>
<p>9. The Constitutional Reform also contemplated reforming the system of election of 
parliamentary representatives and electoral districts to enhance Congress&#8217; 
</p>
<p>representativeness and legitimacy; to separate the administrative and jurisdictional 
functions of the judiciary; to create a judicial career including judges of superior courts now 
elected by Congress; and to increase the budget of the judiciary, the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office and the General Comptroller&#8217;s Office, and budget allocations to municipalities. 
</p>
<p>10. In conformity with the <i>Esquipulas</i> agreements, the Government and the four 
guerrilla fronts had negotiated an amnesty, with the participation of the United Nations and 
the support of the Group of Countries, friends of the peace process. The amnesty had been 
enacted as law by a legitimate Congress, democratically elected. That reality had also been 
disregarded. 
</p>
<p>11. Aware of the need to end the conflict, while at the same time aware of reluctance 
from victims, the Government and the guerrilla conditioned the amnesty to a report on the 
historical truth, without judicial effects. The report was drafted by a commission composed 
of notable national and international members, without the Government&#8217;s participation. The 
amnesty was also conditioned to a National Programme of Reparation for the Victims. 
</p>
<p>12. Historical truth and reparation were &#8211; for the Government of Guatemala &#8211; the key 
elements of reconciliation, and the possible extent of post-conflict justice. To end the 
conflict, the amnesty was required. Although not acceptable to everybody, it was necessary 
to lay down arms and avoid further death and destruction. 
</p>

<p>16.<b> </b>Guatemala referred to the Human Rights Office of the Ministry of the Interior and 
highlighted that, in 2008, a body for analysing attacks against human rights defenders had 
been created. This body was composed of representatives of the judiciary and the 
Presidential Human Rights Commission and was aimed at analysing the criminal context 
and attacks patterns.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>17. Pursuant to Decree No. 40-2000, the Army supported the civil security forces in 
preventing and combating the organized criminal organizations and delinquency, according 
to security needs and when the means of the public security forces were considered 
insufficient. In 2015, an additional 10,000 police officers were expected to be employed. 
</p>
<p>18. The Pact for Security, Justice and Peace developed a strategy which included the 
participation of social actors and State institutions, in order to build legitimacy of actions 
aimed at improving governance and protection against criminality and impunity. The Pact 
integrated social programmes into security and justice programmes. 
</p>
<p>19. Guatemala indicated that, in the 18th zone of Guatemala City (<i>Colonia EL Lim&#243;n</i>), 
which had high rates of criminality, contract killers had committed seven murders between 
January and May. However, since the intervention &#8220;Safe Neighbourhood &#8211; Friendly 
Neighbourhood&#8221;, that took place on 6 June, there had been a notable reduction of 
criminality and no homicides had been registered since that date. 
</p>
<p>20. A governmental decree had been issued to create a specific cabinet, aimed at 
coordinating justice and security annual plans of all the institutions. 
</p>
<p>21. General Order No. 9-2012 of the National Civil Police Directorate created task 
forces to coordinate a strategy with the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office to combat contract 
killers, femicide, extortions, abductions and theft of vehicles and mobile phones. They were 
also created with a view to strengthening the criminal investigation of complex cases over a 
period of six months, which could be extended. As a result, 29 criminal organizations and 
seven femicide organizations had been disbanded. Murders had decreased by 16 per cent, 
and there were 200 fewer cases of femicide compared to the average of over the five 
previous years. Fifty per cent of homicides took place in Guatemala City and, in 2012, 
during 16 days, no violent deaths occurred: an unprecedented occurrence in the last decade. 
Responding to the political will demonstrated by Guatemala, the international community 
had increased assistance to facilitate knowledge transfer to the judiciary from the Task 
Force and the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) at the 
conclusion of their operations. In addition, the Law of the General Directorate for Criminal 
Investigation had been issued. 
</p>
<p>22. The Police assisted in criminal proceedings, whose investigative elements were 
subjected to scientific analysis through the National Institute of Forensic Sciences, the 
newest judicial institution aimed at creating legal security. 
</p>
<p>23.<b> </b>Guatemala stated that, further to the reform of 1994, the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office 
was responsible for criminal investigations and prosecutions. Taking into account the 
historical levels of violence and impunity, the following priorities had been identified: (a) 
crimes against the right to life; (b) violence against women (25 per cent of all complaints); 
(c) organized crime; and (d) corruption. In order to increase efficiency, the following 
strategies had been implemented: (a) inter-institutional coordination among the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and the Ministry of the Interior and collaboration with CICIG in areas 
such as the Office of Protection of Witnesses, the Unit of Criminal Analysis and the Special 
Office against Impunity; (b) special investigation methodology; (c) use of scientific 
evidence; (d) establishment of the new tax administration system; and (e) implementation 
of methodologies on criminal prosecution aimed at criminal structures and illicit markets. </p>


<p>24. Other measures taken included the extension of the geographical coverage of the 
Special Prosecutor&#8217;s Office for Women and Children Victims and the implementation of an 
integral attention model. In order to be in conformity with the Law against Sexual 
Violence, the Prosecutor&#8217;s offices for trafficking in persons and human rights were also 
created. In 2012, seven conviction sentences had been issued related to the protection of 
human rights defenders and three concerning attacks against journalists. 
</p>
<p>25. Guatemala also stated that, in 2011, a unit had been created within the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office to deal with crimes against trade union members. The Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office was part of a board composed of the Ministry of Labour, the judiciary 
and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The board was intended to follow up the 
implementation of International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 87. The board 
carried out a study of 58 cases, which had been systematized and categorized to determine 
whether or not the crimes had been interlinked and targeted trade union members. As a 
result, the investigations had been accelerated and would be concluded soon. 
</p>
<p>26. The Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office had honoured its commitment to double the number 
of interpreters in indigenous languages. At that time, Guatemala had 40 Maya interpreters 
in place, a number which would progressively increase. 
</p>
<p>27.<b> </b>Guatemala referred to the establishment of the Ministry of Social Development, one 
of the first Government actions in line with the State&#8217;s commitment to progressively 
improving the rights of the most excluded persons. Six months on, the Ministry had become 
operational and its social programmes were being articulated through the Cabinet of Social 
Development. Transparency, accountability and implementation of the Law on Access to 
Public Information had been achieved. A database had also been created and 800,000 
women benefiting from the programme on conditional cash transfers now had access to 
banking services.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>28. The Government had been leading the exceptional efforts deployed to address 
malnutrition and its causes. Through the Zero Hunger Pact, the President had called all the 
actors to work on: (a) the 1,000-day window to address chronic malnutrition; (b) 
comprehensive rural development; and (c) the prevention of deaths caused by malnutrition. 
Thanks to the attention given to it, the mortality rate related to extreme malnutrition had 
decreased from 22 per 1,000 to 13 per 1,000. 
</p>
<p>29. Guatemala was seeking to strengthen its institutional system in order to implement 
the Law of Integral Protection of Children and Adolescents. In 2012, the investment to the 
sector increased to 20 per cent of the overall budget. Guatemala had taken action on the 
issue, such as: establishing a high level technical board to support children&#8217;s rights; 
criminalizing abuse of children; approving the law on the alerting system, ALBA-
KENETH, to protect children from sexual violence and trafficking; creating specialized 
courts and the Attorney General&#8217;s Office for Children and Adolescents; and implementing a 
protection system at municipal level. 
</p>
<p>30. Guatemala stated that legislation, policies and institutional mechanisms had been 
harmonized to eliminate the worst forms of child labour, which had been criminalized. 
Regulations to ILO Convention No. 182 were currently in force and the National 
Commission to Eliminate Child Labour was developing guidelines to enrol children into 
schools and incorporate their families into social programmes. 
</p>
<p>31. Regarding the rights of persons with disabilities, among actions undertaken by 
Guatemala to implement the law and policies in this matter, during the 2011 elections, 
special measures had been taken to guarantee the right to vote of persons with disabilities, 
such as special ballot boxes and papers in braille. A bonus for poor families with a member 
with disabilities was also granted. </p>


<p>32. Regarding measures for the youth, Guatemala referred to the creation of the cabinet 
and the policy to promote the young people&#8217;s development and participation that, with the 
strategy &#8220;<i>Jovenes protagonistas</i>&#8221;, aimed at promoting their artistic, sportive and 
technological development. The programme of grants for employment sought to integrate 
them into the formal labour market. </p>
<p>33. Guatemala also referred to the programme assisting elderly persons without social 
protection, which had been strengthened, incorporating social programmes; and to the 
several centres of daily attention for elderly persons which had also been put in place. 
</p>
<p>34. Guatemala concluded indicating that the Ministry of Social Development supported 
the enjoyment of indigenous rights, by extending the participation of indigenous peoples in 
social programmes and assisting them in strengthening their identity; and that development 
plans were being carried out in regions such as <i>El Polochic</i>.  
</p>
<p>35.<b> </b>Guatemala stated that, through the National Policy of Promotion and Integral 
Development, and its Plan of Equality of Opportunities (2008&#8211;2023) Guatemala gave 
priority to the implementation of the rights of Maya, Garifuna, Xinca and mestizo women. 
It referred to actions taken to protect and promote the rights of women such as: (a) the 
Lands Fund and the Secretary of Agrarian Affairs working together to respond to the 
women requests to access to land and housing; (b) the concept of peasant economy being 
incorporated into the policy of rural integral development, for which peasant women were a 
priority &#8211; in that regard, actions have been taken with the banking institutions; (c) the 
gender and ethnic dimensions being taking into account when designing the budget 
structure; and (d) the creation of a specific cabinet for women, headed by the Vice-
President.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>36. Regarding violence against women, Guatemala referred to efforts undertaken to 
strengthen the information and registration of different types of violence; and indicated that 
the Presidential Secretary of Women coordinated the Articulated Inter-Institutional Plan to 
Address Prevention of Violence against Women. In 2011, a protocol to identify and provide 
assistance in cases of violence had been implemented within the national education system 
and, in 2012, the Ministry of Education had put in place several strategies to prevent 
violence against children from a human rights perspective, such as the media campaign 
&#8220;ALTO&#8221; and the pilot plan of municipal pacts to prevent violence against women in four 
departments. 
</p>
<p>37. Regarding access to justice for women, Guatemala highlighted the establishment of 
the Justice Centre for Femicide and Other Forms of Violence against Women, which had 
initiated its activities on 5 October. The following tools had also been created: the inter-
institutional Protocol against Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking and the inter-institutional 
Protocol for the Repatriation of Victims of Trafficking. In addition, in 2011, the first shelter 
for victims of trafficking had been established. Seven centres of integral attention were in 
place and the approval of three additional centres was under way. In 2012, the public 
investment had increased 20 per cent with respect to the previous four years. 
</p>
<p>38. Guatemala indicated that, through the unit for health care for indigenous peoples, the 
Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance had designed a proposal for a complaint 
procedure that had been supported by the hospitals and health centres in four departments 
and its implementation in the whole country was expected. 
</p>
<p>39. Since 2011, the &#8220;restitution of rights&#8221; programme had being implemented. It was 
aimed at creating favourable conditions for restitution of rights to victims and giving them a 
living project allowing them to satisfy their basic, emotional and social requirements.
