<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 At the invitation of the Government of Chile, the Working Group on Enforced or 
Involuntary Disappearances visited the country from 13 to 21 August 2012. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group recognizes that since the return to democracy, significant steps 
have been taken to secure truth, justice, reparation and to preserve memory in the face of 
the grave human rights violations committed during the military dictatorship. These 
achievements have been the result of initiatives undertaken, promoted or carried out mainly 
by relatives of the victims, civil society and some State actors. The Working Group noted 
that the State should assert its responsibility and leadership by ensuring that these 
initiatives are part of a comprehensive, consistent and continuous policy. 
</p>
<p> Chile still faces other important challenges, including the fact that the Amnesty 
Decree-Law is still in force, the imposition of minor penalties on perpetrators, the slow 
progress of judicial proceedings, the continued use of military courts &#8212; even in cases of 
human rights violations &#8212; and the absence of a national plan to search for disappeared 
persons.

</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances 
visited Chile from 13 to 21 August 2012. The Working Group wishes to thank the 
Government of Chile for extending an invitation to visit the country, for its positive 
cooperation before, during and after the mission, and for its openness to dialogue with the 
members of the Working Group. In addition, the Working Group wishes to thank civil 
society organizations, in particular associations of relatives of disappeared persons, and all 
the sectors of society with which it met.  
</p>
<p>2. The mission was conducted by two members of the Working Group: Ms. Jasminka 
Dzumhur and Mr. Ariel Dulitzky. The purpose of the visit was to examine the main 
initiatives and policies of the Chilean State in relation to enforced or involuntary 
disappearances in the context of past human rights violations, to assess the progress made 
in investigations and judicial proceedings involving cases of enforced disappearance, and to 
address issues related to truth, reparation for victims and prevention of enforced 
disappearance, inter alia. 
</p>
<p>3. The experts met with various authorities, including the Minister of Justice, the 
Deputy Director General for Multilateral and Global Affairs, and the Director of Human 
Rights at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the Undersecretary of the Interior and the 
Executive Secretary of the Human Rights Programme of the Ministry of the Interior and 
Public Security; the National Director of the Civil Registry and Identity Service; the 
National Director of the Forensic Medical Service; the Undersecretary for Justice; the 
Undersecretary for Defence; the Legal Aid Agency, Metropolitana Region; the Head of the 
Human Rights Department of Carabineros (Police); the National Head of the Human Rights 
Offences Unit of the Investigative Police; the Attorney-General (Public Prosecution 
Service), and the National Director of the Prison Service. The Working Group also met 
with the President of the Senate and the Presidents of the Senate&#8217;s Committee on Human 
Rights, Nationality and Citizenship, and Committee on the Constitution, Legislation, 
Justice and Regulations; the President of the State Defence Council; the President of the 
Supreme Court of Justice, and the coordinating judge on human rights cases.  
</p><p>4. The Working Group also met with the National Human Rights Institute, with 
associations of relatives of disappeared detainees executed persons and political exiles, and 
with other civil society organizations and academics. Furthermore, the experts met with the 
Archbishop of Santiago. The Working Group visited the Memory and Human Rights 
Museum, Londres 38, Villa Grimaldi, and the Paine memorial. 
</p>
<p>5. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 908 cases to the 
Government of Chile, of which 806 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Right to the truth 
</b></p>
<p>6. The military dictatorship committed grave and systematic human rights violations 
between 1973 and 1990, including enforced disappearances. Since the return to democracy, 
important institutional processes have been initiated to secure the truth in relation to 
disappearance, with the establishment, for instance, of truth commissions and other bodies 
tasked with determining the fate of victims. 
</p>
<p>7. In 1990, the National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation (known as the 
&#8220;Rettig Commission&#8221;) was created with the mandate of investigating the situation of 
persons who had disappeared or had been executed during the military dictatorship. The 
Commission concluded its work in February 1991. The Working Group acknowledges the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> GE.13-10432 
</p>
<p>seriousness and professionalism of the Rettig Commission. According to its report, the 
Commission received 3,550 complaints, of which 2,296 were considered justified; 979 of 
these were cases of enforced disappearance. During the presentation of the report, the 
President made an official apology and individual letters were sent to the families. 
</p>
<p>8. In February 1992, Act No. 19.123 established the National Reparation and 
Reconciliation Board with a view to coordinating and implementing the reparation 
measures proposed by the Rettig Commission, and recognizing the status of victims of 
human rights violations whose cases the Retting Commission was unable to consider due to 
lack of evidence or because background information was not submitted. The Board 
published the Report on the Classification of Victims of Human Rights and Political 
Violence, in which the status of an additional 899 victims was recognized, and of those, 
123 were cases of enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p>9. In 1999, the Forum for Dialogue (Mesa de Di&#225;logo) was established with a view to 
involving the Armed Forces in the national dialogue on human rights violations under the 
military dictatorship, and to compile information on the fate of disappeared persons. 
Representatives of military and religious institutions, as well as lawyers and human rights 
defenders attending in their personal capacity, participated in the Forum for Dialogue. The 
main associations of relatives of victims did not participate in this Forum, as it operated 
under Act No. 19.687 of June 2000 whereby its work was deemed confidential in order to 
protect &#8220;those who present information that could help locate disappeared detainees&#8221;. Some 
sources reported that one of the most important achievements of the Forum was the first 
unequivocal institutional recognition by the Armed Forces of their responsibility for human 
rights violations, including enforced disappearances. Another notable achievement was that 
the subsequent transmission of its findings to the courts prompted the Supreme Court to 
appoint judges to exclusively investigate cases of human rights violations. A serious 
setback was the fact that the information provided by the Armed Forces as a result of the 
agreements reached in the Forum for Dialogue was often incomplete or erroneous, which 
generated mistrust among associations of relatives of victims. 
</p>
<p>10. In August 2003, the National Commission on Political Prisoners and Torture (the 
&#8220;Valech Commission&#8221;) was established. The Valech Commission took testimonies, 
compiled information and drew up a list of surviving victims who had been deprived of 
their liberty and tortured for political reasons &#8211; situations that were not covered individually 
by the Rettig Commission. The Valech Commission received testimonies from more than 
35,000 people and established the status of 28,459 individuals as victims of political 
imprisonment and torture in an official report and another additional report published in 
2004 and 2005, respectively.  
</p>
<p>11. Finally, Act No. 20.405 of 10 December 2009 created the National Human Rights 
Institute and, under a transitional article, the Advisory Commission on the Classification of 
Disappeared Detainees, Victims of Political Executions and Victims of Political 
Imprisonment and Torture, known as &#8220;Valech II&#8221;. This institution had the task of receiving 
new testimonies and/or new information about possible cases of enforced disappearance, 
political execution, political imprisonment or torture that had not been recognized by the 
previous commissions. In its report of August 2011, the Commission recognized 9,795 new 
cases of survivors of political prison and torture and 8 new cases of enforced disappearance. 
Sources reported that the Commission had not been consistent in its application of the 
classification criteria and recognized significantly fewer cases than the Valech I 
Commission. Questions were also raised regarding the failure to notify new victims or 
relatives personally and the lack of channels to challenge the classification. 
</p>
<p>12. In all, the Rettig, Valech I and Valech II Commissions recognized approximately 
1,110 people as victims of enforced disappearance. It was suggested, depending on the 
source, that 7, 9 or 12 incorrectly classified cases should be withdrawn. These important </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.13-10432 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>Commissions represent a major step forward in the search for the truth. The discrepancies 
in the number of possible incorrect classifications, as well as progress in judicial 
investigations of cases of enforced disappearance, highlight the need for a centralized 
database on the subject and an ongoing classification and review process. The legal 
provisions stipulating the confidentiality of the documents, witness statements, and records 
of the Valech I and II Commissions represent a step backwards with respect to the Rettig 
Commission, whose records and statements were available to the judiciary. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Human Rights Programme of the Ministry of the Interior 
</b></p>
<p>13. The Human Rights Programme (the Programme), created in July 1997 in the 
Ministry of the Interior, is an important institutional forum that demonstrated a high degree 
of openness during the visit of the Working Group. The Programme promotes the adoption 
of measures and contributes to establishing the truth about the fate or whereabouts of the 
victims of enforced disappearance, as &#8220;an inalienable right of the relatives of the victims 
and of Chilean society&#8221; (Act No. 19.123 of 1996). The initial mandate of the Programme 
was to provide assistance, mainly social, to the relatives of disappeared detainees and 
victims of political execution whose remains had not been returned to their relatives. This 
mandate was strengthened following the Forum for Dialogue and, in 2009, the Programme 
was granted the authority to take legal action in all known cases of disappearance or 
execution. At the end of 2009, it filed the first complaints, which were declared admissible 
in 2010, and was a party to the proceedings. This represents the first full and systematic 
exercise by the State in its duty to prosecute crimes against humanity, because previously 
the State had limited itself to participating, either through the State Defence Council &#8212; in a 
small number of cases of public importance submitted by relatives &#8212; or through the 
Programme, acting only as an &#8220;intervener&#8221;. According to the information received since 
then, the Programme has been a party to 592 cases of human rights violations, of which 219 
concerned victims of enforced disappearance, involving a total of 568 victims. 
</p>
<p>14. Many sources expressed their concern at the changes in the personnel of the 
Programme since 2010, with the departure of several lawyers with extensive experience. 
The Programme now has 20 lawyers and 7 legal representatives, which represents a 
commendable increase in the number of personnel in the Legal Unit. Younger lawyers who 
have recently joined the Programme have been trained mainly in the new criminal system 
rather than in the old system which applies to these cases, which makes it hard for them to 
adapt to the new role assigned to the Programme, but the Working Group recognizes the 
training of many of the Programme&#8217;s new lawyers in international human rights law as a 
valuable tool for their work. This Programme also faces many obstacles in the 
implementation of its mandate, including the long period of time that has elapsed since the 
violations were committed; the destruction of documents and material evidence; the death 
of witnesses and officials; the failure of the Armed Forces to provide documents; the delays 
in endorsing new complaints at the Ministry of the Interior; and the delaying tactics of the 
defence lawyers. 
</p>
<p>15. The Working Group is particularly concerned about the information provided by 
some relatives of disappeared individuals and associations of relatives of victims 
concerning their lack of trust in the Human Rights Programme, and the absence of 
interaction of this Programme with the main associations of relatives of victims. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Search and investigation  
</b></p>
<p>16. A very important step in the process of ascertaining the truth is the search for and 
identification of victims of disappearance, which cannot be the task of the relatives alone </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.13-10432 
</p>
<p>but should be treated as a State obligation requiring serious commitment. The compilation 
of data in the field, the adoption of specific policies, promotion and awareness-raising 
activities, the monitoring of exhumation and identification processes, and commemorations 
and other public events, all help speed up the process of clarifying the fate of the 
disappeared. 
</p>
<p>17. The Forensic Medical Service, which operates under the Ministry of Justice, plays 
an essential role in establishing the identity of disappeared persons and the possible causes 
of death. The Service maintains excellent cooperation with accredited foreign institutions 
that provide it with support in the analysis of human remains. The Working Group was very 
impressed with the work and development of the Service despite difficulties related to, 
among others, cover-up actions undertaken during the dictatorship such as the &#8220;Television 
Removal Operation&#8221;, the poor condition of skeletal remains, fragmentation, problems in 
locating family donors, and the death of some of the most suitable family members. The 
Forensic Medical Service has identified 282 disappeared and executed persons through 
recovered remains. Of these cases, 142 are victims of enforced disappearance. Between 
July 2007 and July 2012 a total of 122 identifications were reported to the courts and the 
relatives. Errors in the original identification of some remains found in 1991 in Patio 29 of 
the General Cemetery, the discovery of which in 2006 led to extensive and constructive 
reorganization of the Service, illustrates the need for a highly qualified forensic medical 
service. 
</p>
<p>18. The Forensic Medical Service has developed a national database with DNA samples 
of relatives of victims recognized by the different Commissions to ensure that any newly 
discovered human remains can be correctly and rapidly identified. The Service has taken 
blood samples from 3,470 families representing 978 victims. Cooperation has been 
established with the relatives of victims of enforced disappearance. There are still dozens of 
victims of enforced disappearance for whom there are no matching blood samples from 
relatives to facilitate identification in the future. 
</p>
<p>19. The Working Group stresses the importance of continuing the exhumation and 
identification of victims of enforced disappearance. These activities require a 
comprehensive State policy, with full institutional, political and financial support from the 
legislative, executive and judicial branches. Full cooperation and coordination are also 
essential, both at the intersectoral level and between agencies, as well as between these 
agencies and the relatives and associations of relatives. 
</p>
<p>20. According to several sources, some judges lack a victim-based focus that takes into 
consideration the suffering caused by enforced disappearance, and its impact. The Working 
Group received information about the productive and positive efforts of the Forensic 
Medical Service, and the protocols it had developed, to interact with the families of 
disappeared persons and to ensure that they are firmly committed to the process of 
identifying remains. These practices must be fully supported and should serve as a model 
for other State institutions, including the judiciary and the Programme. 
</p><p>21. The Working Group also takes note of the role of the national Civil Registry and 
Identity Service in intervening when a body is identified and issuing decisions to transfer 
the property of the person absent due to enforced disappearance, in accordance with Act 
No. 20.377 of 2009. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Compilation and systematization of information 
</b></p>
<p>22. In Chile &#8220;absent&#8221; victims are generally classified into two categories: victims of 
enforced disappearance and victims of political execution. Within the latter category, a 
distinction is made between victims according to whether their remains have been returned </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.13-10432 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>or not. This term is used to describe circumstances in which, notwithstanding evidence or 
general recognition that the person was executed, the body has not been returned to the 
relatives &#8211; a situation which in other countries is considered to constitute enforced 
disappearance. 
</p>
<p>23. The information regarding the number of cases registered, investigated and 
prosecuted, the number of exhumations and identifications, the requests for reparation 
submitted and granted or rejected, and the progress of judicial proceedings, inter alia, is not 
compiled by only one State institution. The information publicly available on the 
Programme&#8217;s website is partial and is not updated. A regularly updated central database is 
crucial to promote transparency, accuracy and security in relation to enforced 
disappearances, as well as to understand and monitor State efforts in this area. The 
information available is not sufficiently disaggregated. For instance, the number of cases of 
enforced disappearance of women or Mapuche people under investigation may be requested 
periodically from the Programme but is not permanently monitored and updated. 
Furthermore, there appears to be no full list of recognized victims available for public 
access or in any State department. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Right to justice 
</b>24. During the military dictatorship and in the first years after the return to democracy, 
there was total impunity in cases of enforced disappearance, even when judicial 
investigations were conducted. It is only from 1998, when lawsuits against Augusto 
Pinochet were admitted, that very important developments emerged in the area of justice. 
Cases were reopened through the application of the Amnesty Decree-Law and trials 
previously held in military courts were referred to the ordinary courts. Developments in the 
field of justice were largely due to the fact that Chilean judges began to consistently 
implement the human rights treaties ratified by the State, which included the main human 
rights treaties such as the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance, the Inter-American Convention on Forced Disappearance of 
Persons, and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p>25. Significant momentum was gained in 2001 when the Supreme Court decided to 
allocate cases to a group of Court of Appeal judges and specialized judges throughout the 
country. In 2006, these specialized judges were abolished and the cases were handed over 
to special inspecting judges, coordinated by a Supreme Court judge. The overall purpose 
was to expedite and ensure the proper investigation of cases involving serious human rights 
violations with due regard for their seriousness and complexity. Thirty-two independent 
judges from the different Courts of Appeal are now assigned to the various human rights 
cases. However, the Working Group is concerned by the overwhelming caseload borne by 
the inspecting judges. There is clearly a shortage of judges, which adversely affects the 
chances of prompt and effective proceedings. Furthermore, some of these judges continue 
their regular activities in Courts of Appeal and are unable to devote themselves exclusively 
to these cases. 
</p>
<p>26. Chile is perhaps the country with the most comprehensive judicial response to 
serious human rights violations, including enforced disappearances, as proceedings on 
behalf of at least three quarters of the total number of victims of enforced disappearance 
have been concluded or are under way: 771 individuals have been tried and convicted for 
human rights violations since 2000. Since 2002, the Supreme Court has handed down 150 
sentences in cases of human rights violations, of which 133 were convictions. Ninety of the 
sentences involved cases of enforced disappearance affecting 178 victims (78 sentences, in 
respect of 163 victims, were convictions). According to the Supreme Court, 132 cases of 
enforced disappearance are currently the subject of judicial proceedings, comprising 93 at </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> GE.13-10432 
</p>
<p>the pretrial stage, 22 at the trial stage, 10 that have been tried, and 7 at other stages of the 
proceedings. These cases affect 556 victims who are still awaiting a final judgement. The 
Working Group congratulates the State and Chilean society on the impressive progress 
made in the field of justice. 
</p><p>27. Nevertheless, it is of concern that only 64 individuals convicted of serious human 
rights violations are currently serving prison sentences, while 173 officials convicted for 
serious human rights violations have never been imprisoned, having received light, non-
custodial sentences in accordance with Acts Nos. 18.2161 and 20.603.2 Under article 4 of 
the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons against Enforced Disappearance (the 
Declaration), the punishment of enforced disappearance shall take into account the 
seriousness of the offence. This requires that enforced disappearance should be classified as 
a separate offence with commensurate punishment, and that individuals found guilty of 
committing enforced disappearances should effectively serve such punishment. 
</p>
<p>28. In Chile there seems to have been a pattern, since 2007, of imposing non-effective 
sentences (non-custodial sentences) on the perpetrators of these offences, or custodial 
sentences mainly on persons already in prison. It appears that this is essentially a result of 
the application of two principles that are contrary to those underpinning the Declaration. On 
the one hand, there is the application of the partial lapse of the statute of limitations, a 
potential mitigating factor provided for in article 103 of the Criminal Code. However, since 
May this year, the Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court has not applied the partial lapse 
of the statute of limitations, which is a very important development. This recent case law, in 
contrast with that which had prevailed since mid-2007, implicitly or explicitly recognizes 
that the statute of limitations and the partial lapse of the statute of limitations have the same 
legal basis and that therefore neither of the two procedures should be applied, a view the 
Working Group fully supports. The Working Group hopes that these decisions become 
standard jurisprudence of the Chilean judiciary. The partial lapse of the statute of 
limitations should not be applied because, it takes into account the passage of time and thus 
it essentially has the same legal basis as the statute of limitations. If the effect of the partial 
lapse of statute of limitations is to preclude effective punishment, as required under the 
Declaration, it should not be applied. 
</p>
<p>29. The Working Group was also informed of 119 cases in which &#8220;irreproachable 
conduct prior to the commission of the offence&#8221; was applied as a mitigating factor, even in 
cases in which persons have been repeatedly convicted for executions and enforced 
disappearances. The courts only consider whether, at the time of the commission of each 
offence, the persons in question had not been convicted of other offences. This is absolutely 
impossible to verify given the systematic pattern of impunity during the military 
dictatorship. Considering this as a mitigating circumstance encourages non-custodial 
sentences. In addition, the application of the partial lapse of the statute of limitations makes 
it impossible to apply particularly aggravating circumstances such as premeditation. 
</p>
<p>30. Under article 4.2 of the Declaration, special attention must be paid when considering 
mitigating circumstances if &#8220;persons who, having participated in enforced disappearances, 
are instrumental in bringing the victims forward alive or in volunteering information which 
would contribute to clarifying cases of enforced disappearance&#8221;. This is enshrined in article 
11, paragraph 9 of the Criminal Code which provides for effective cooperation. 
</p>
<p>31. The Working Group also received worrying information regarding conditions of 
detention for persons convicted of enforced disappearance. These persons are reportedly 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 Act No. 18.216, establishing alternatives to the deprivation or restriction of liberty. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 Act No. 20.603, amending Act No. 18.216.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.13-10432 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>not detained in ordinary prisons, or in maximum security prisons by virtue of the 
seriousness of the offence committed, but in purpose-built premises in Punta Peuco and 
Cordillera, both governed by the Prison Regulations. 
</p>
<p>32. Several of the persons convicted of enforced disappearance have received privileges 
such as prison benefits apparently allowing them to obtain permission to go out on Sundays 
or weekends, to be released on parole and/or to receive a reduced sentence before the full 
completion of the original conviction. Although the Working Group considers that all 
persons convicted of enforced disappearance have the same rights as the prison population 
in general, there are three essential elements to bear in mind. Firstly, the granting of any 
type of benefit must be subject to effective judicial oversight. Secondly, the particular 
seriousness of the offence must be considered when deciding to grant benefits. Thirdly, 
there must be a transparent process which provides appropriate public information on the 
criteria used for the granting of these benefits and the reasons for their award in each 
specific case. Act No. 20.587, which rules out the involvement of the executive in the 
granting and/or denial of the benefit of conditional release, is one step in the right direction, 
albeit insufficient. 
</p>
<p>33. Progress has been made in delivering justice in spite of the absence of a separate 
offence of enforced disappearance. This means that in the case of enforced disappearances 
committed in the context of the military dictatorship, individuals are tried and punished for 
aggravated kidnapping (article 141 of the Criminal Code), which fails to encompass the 
totality, complexity and seriousness of the enforced disappearance. Article 6 of Act No. 
20.357 on crimes against humanity and genocide and war crimes classifies and punishes the 
offence of enforced disappearance of persons as part of a widespread or systematic attack 
against any civilian population. But even today, enforced disappearance is not a criminal 
offence in Chile outside the context of crimes against humanity. 
</p>
<p>34. Countless human rights lawyers and civil society organizations, through their 
tireless efforts, have been the main promoters of court action for enforced disappearance 
and other serious human rights violations that occurred during the military dictatorship. 
This work has been significantly strengthened by the appointment of the inspecting judges, 
many of whom, since 2000, have carried out and continue to carry out an exemplary role in 
effectively promoting the prosecution of cases of enforced disappearance and other related 
offences. However, even today, the idea prevails in many sectors of society and the State 
that the investigation of enforced disappearances is a matter for the individual initiative of 
relatives and their lawyers rather than being a duty of the State. The Programme&#8217;s mandate 
was extended only in 2009 to enable it to take action <i>proprio motu</i> on behalf of any victim 
of disappearance or execution. The Human Rights Office of the Legal Aid Agency in the 
Metropolitan Region also efficiently represents victims acting as plaintiffs in several cases 
of enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p>35. The Human Rights Brigade of the Investigative Police &#8212; as an auxiliary judiciary 
body &#8212; investigates cases of human rights violations, thus playing an exemplary and 
essential role in the proceedings. The Brigade has accumulated extensive experience in the 
investigation of these events, by developing practices that take due account of the 
specificity of the offence of enforced disappearance and the particular sensitivity required 
in dealing with victims and relatives of disappeared persons. As with the Programme, since 
2010, concern has been expressed regarding the transfer of experienced personnel of the 
Brigade, with the resulting erosion of human capital, specialized knowledge and 
relationships of trust with relatives, witnesses and informers. 
</p>
<p>36. According to the information available, judicial proceedings take a long time. Most 
cases initiated or reopened in 1998 remain unresolved almost 15 years later. Despite the 
obvious complexity of some of these investigations, in view of the fact that most 
disappearances occurred more than three decades ago, the State, particularly the judiciary, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> GE.13-10432 
</p>
<p>the Investigative Police and the Programme, need to take urgent action. To be effective, the 
investigation of serious and systematic human rights violations must be carried out within a 
reasonable time frame. The passage of time increases the risk of destruction or loss of 
evidence as well as the possibility that witnesses, perpetrators and relatives will die. Judges, 
as leaders and guarantors of the process, must avoid any delaying tactics without impairing 
the rights of the accused to due process, in accordance with the requirements of article 16.4 
of the Declaration. The Working Group received reports that the submission of complaints 
by the Programme was delayed for failure to receive prompt approval by the 
Undersecretary of the Interior. 
</p>
<p>37. The Working Group emphasizes that military courts lack the necessary 
independence and impartiality to deal with human rights violations, as recognized by the 
Supreme Court itself. Act No. 20.477 of 2010 amended the jurisdiction of military courts, 
restricting it to prevent any civilians being subject to military jurisdiction. However, 
military courts still have jurisdiction over human rights violations against civilians by 
military officials or Carabineros today. The Working Group was informed that the Ministry 
of Defence was considering a comprehensive reform of the military justice system. 
</p><p>38. The Working Group received information on the case of a young Mapuche aged 16 
years, Jos&#233; Huenante, who disappeared in 2005, investigation of which was assigned to the 
military justice system because those responsible were reportedly Carabineros. This 
contravenes article 16.2 of the Declaration and constitutes a major obstacle to efforts to end 
impunity in this case of enforced disappearance. Cases such as that of Jos&#233; Huenante should 
be investigated promptly and effectively by the ordinary justice system. Still today, the 
Chilean Carabineros are subject to military jurisdiction for any unlawful act committed by 
their members. The Working Group has been informed of a new bill to reform military 
jurisdiction and hopes that it will ultimately curtail its scope, in accordance with 
international standards. 
</p>
<p>39. The cases of 34 victims of enforced disappearance were finally dismissed in their 
entirety through the application of the Amnesty Decree-Law (DL 2.191, 1978). Although in 
recent years the courts have not applied the Amnesty Decree-Law to crimes against 
humanity or war crimes, including enforced disappearance, there is no guarantee that that 
practice will not be resumed. Article 18.1 of the Declaration states that persons responsible 
for enforced disappearances shall not benefit from any amnesty. This is consistent with the 
principle upheld by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in the case<i> Almonacid 
Arellano v. Chile</i>. The fact that the Amnesty Decree-Law remains in force poses a latent 
risk that, should there be a shift in the make-up or the opinion of the Supreme Court, it 
could be applied to its application in the future. Furthermore, it can be interpreted to mean 
that the executive and the legislature do not have the political support to categorically state 
that offences of enforced disappearance shall not be eligible for amnesty. A bill to 
&#8220;reinterpret&#8221;, not the Amnesty Decree-Law but the articles of the Criminal Code relating to 
its application (93 and 103), which would have prohibited the application of amnesty in 
these cases was unfortunately not approved by Congress. 
</p>
<p>40. The entire national legal framework on enforced disappearance dates back to the 
military dictatorship or was in force at that time. Modernization of the law and its 
adjustment in line with the international treaties ratified by Chile have not had any impact 
on the administration of justice. For example, the provisions of the old Code of Criminal 
Procedure apply in this context, involving an inquisitorial procedure in which the judge 
initiates criminal proceedings and carries out the investigation. This procedure also 
authorizes other persons and bodies to initiate criminal proceedings as private litigants 
(<i>querellante particular</i>). 
41. The Working Group welcomed the Government&#8217;s assurance that the Armed Forces 
are fully committed to cooperating with judicial investigations and providing any </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.13-10432 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>information it has. However, different sources reported that judicial requests for records 
addressed to the various branches of the armed and security forces were answered only 
partially, with information crucial to the progress of the investigations omitted or denied. 
</p>
<p>42. According to information received, many of the judges in charge of these cases 
focus their attention on the most emblematic cases, for various reasons, or on some 
specifically chosen cases, thereby neglecting a large number of cases. In addition, apart 
from receiving reports prepared by each judge, the coordinating judge has little to do, 
providing mainly logistical support. Yet, various sources indicated &#8212; and the Supreme 
Court confirmed &#8212; that there was no substantive coordination between all inspecting 
judges that would allow them to exchange information, or conduct joint or complementary 
investigations combining different lines of investigation, which would address the 
systematic nature of serious human rights violations. As a result, many trials have to 
reproduce exactly the same documentary evidence, testimonies, and expert reports already 
produced in other trials, or else each investigation has to start from the beginning 
irrespective of developments in related cases. The Human Rights Brigade of the 
Investigative Police have developed a practice of investigating violations from a systemic 
perspective, taking into consideration the modus operandi developed during the 
dictatorship. This practice has been strengthened by the recent creation within the Brigade 
of an analysis unit and a database which compiles the results of its investigations. The 
judiciary should do likewise. 
</p><p>43. During the dictatorships in the Southern Cone, the armed and security forces acted 
in a coordinated and cooperative way, particularly through Operaci&#243;n Condor. Yet there 
seems to be no close cooperation between the Chilean judiciary and identification 
institutions and those of other countries in the region either in terms of judicial 
investigations or in the search for disappeared persons. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Right to reparation  
</b></p>
<p>44. Chile is perhaps the country that has granted the highest level of financial 
reparations to victims of enforced disappearance. The total amount of reparations is 
reportedly over US$ 1,500 million. Act No. 19.123 established benefits for relatives of 
victims recognized by the Rettig Commission and the National Reparation and 
Reconciliation Board. The relatives of the victims recognized by the Valech II Commission 
have the same rights. The law establishes a reparations pension for the immediate family; a 
reparations voucher for victims&#8217; children aged over 25; a compensation payment for the 
immediate family; study grants for victims&#8217; children aged up to 35; access to the 
Compensation and Comprehensive Health-Care and Human Rights Programme, giving 
access to the public health system for free physical and mental health care; exemption from 
compulsory military service for victims&#8217; children, grandchildren, siblings, nephews and 
nieces; and counselling and support for relatives in relation to identification and return of 
the remains of victims. Furthermore, the Compensation and Comprehensive Health-Care 
and Human Rights Programme covers the costs of funeral ceremonies arranged by relatives 
of victims once remains are returned, as well as costs of investigations ordered by the 
judges concerned.  
</p><p>45. The Working Group recognizes the importance of the universal system of pensions 
for all relatives of disappeared persons, established by Act No. 19.123. The Act guarantees 
a minimum equal level for all victims. However, this universal system does not allow for 
the assessment of individual damages or of the suffering of the disappeared person or their 
relatives. The reparations required by the Declaration must remedy the direct consequences 
of the enforced disappearance, and that means the particular situation of each person and 
each case must be considered. From this point of view, the Compensation and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> GE.13-10432 
</p>
<p>Comprehensive Health-Care and Human Rights Programme is extremely important, being 
the only component of the reparation mechanism that takes into consideration the 
individual needs of each beneficiary. 
</p>
<p>46. The importance of the Compensation and Comprehensive Health-Care and Human 
Rights Programme must be emphasized. Given that the passage of time affects individual 
situations and generates new and particular needs among relatives of disappeared persons, 
clear technical guidance is required for the Programme, as well as an evaluation process 
and periodic adjustment. Several relatives of disappeared persons reported that the 
beneficiaries of the Programme faced problems such as a scarcity of medical specialists, 
particularly in the regions. 
</p>
<p>47. Regarding claims for civil reparations in court, the State Defence Council and the 
third Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court consider that they should not be 
addressed since the victims would already have been granted reparations under Act No. 
19.123, and in view of the four-year statute of limitations established by article 2332 of the 
Civil Code. Conversely, the Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court considers financial 
reparation from the State to be applicable where it is ordered in conjunction with criminal 
convictions against military officials in cases of enforced disappearance. In view of the 
disagreement between the two Chambers, the plenary of the Supreme Court has been 
requested to resolve this matter. The Working Group considers that the Declaration 
distinguishes between the civil liability of the State for the enforced disappearance of a 
person (art. 5) and the compensation to which all victims of enforced disappearance have a 
right (art. 19). Accordingly, benefits under Act No. 19.123 and civil reparations through the 
courts must not be considered mutually exclusive. Where appropriate, an exception for 
partial payment could be established. Furthermore, since the civil liability of the State is 
incurred by the seriousness of the offence of enforced disappearance, the passage of time 
should not be made an impediment to civil claims by means of provisions such as the 
statute of limitations and, in particular, the short time limits provided for in the Civil Code.  
</p>
<p>48. The Valech II Commission has demonstrated that the number of victims of enforced 
disappearance can still rise. In the current context, with more than 1,000 ongoing cases, it is 
plausible that new evidence may attest to the existence of other victims of enforced 
disappearance. However, in Chile there are no mechanisms in place to confer the status of 
disappeared person on anyone other than those who have been recognized as victims by the 
Rettig or Valech II Commissions, which directly affects the right of the relatives to 
reparation. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Preservation of memory 
</b></p>
<p>49. In recent years there has been a steady increase in new memorial initiatives and 
other steps to restore and preserve the memory of serious human rights violations and their 
victims. The various memorials constitute a collective recognition by society of the 
violations that have occurred, and demonstrate society&#8217;s rejection and condemnation of 
these violations. In this respect, the visit of the President of Chile to the Museum of 
Memory and Human Rights marked a major milestone for Chilean society. 
</p><p>50. The growing number of memorials being built and maintained for the preservation 
of historic memory has been the result of civil society initiatives, driven mainly by 
associations of relatives of victims rather than State policy. The Working Group has been 
informed, and has been able to confirm in some cases, that certain memorials are not being 
adequately maintained by the State. However, the State has supported the construction and 
maintenance of several memorials and the development of cultural works of various kinds. 
The Programme has had an instrumental role in this regard and has participated in the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.13-10432 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>development and implementation of 72 projects to date. According to the information 
provided, the Programme receives requests to support architectural and artistic projects 
presented by relatives&#8217; associations and civil society organizations, sometimes for new 
buildings, sometimes for restoration of existing memorials. The Working Group did not 
receive information on the evaluation criteria used by the Programme for construction or 
restoration projects; neither did it receive information on prioritization criteria or amounts 
allocated when the funds requested for different projects exceed the available budget. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Coordination 
</b>51. Most State officials, NGOs and relatives of victims of enforced disappearance raised 
the problem of partial or complete lack of coordination between the different institutions. 
The Working Group heard different opinions on the desirability of creating an 
Undersecretary for Human Rights as proposed by the current Government. Although the 
Working Group does not take a position on this initiative, it emphasizes the importance of 
having an appropriate coordination mechanism with clearly defined responsibilities at every 
level of Government with a view to coordinating the activities of the different institutions 
involved in the prevention of disappearance and the search for disappeared persons, as well 
as in the investigation of cases of enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. National Human Rights Plan of Action 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Working Group observed that there is still a lack of coordination and of a 
comprehensive approach to human rights, including in the area of enforced disappearance. 
The adoption of a National Human Rights Plan of Action, as recommended by the 1993 
World Conference on Human Rights, can contribute to greater promotion and protection of 
human rights as a national priority. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Awareness-raising, human rights education and other 
preventive measures 
</b></p>
<p>53. The military dictatorship committed very serious human rights violations. In order to 
avoid the recurrence of such events in future, it is essential to effectively raise public 
awareness of what happened and to properly educate future generations about the past and 
about human rights. In this connection, the Working Group welcomed reports that the 
training courses for the Armed Forces and Carabineros include human rights and 
international humanitarian law. The Working Group stresses the importance of ensuring 
that training for military personnel and Carabineros, as well as medical personnel, State 
officials and other persons involved in the custody and treatment of persons deprived of 
liberty, includes the necessary instruction on relevant provisions of the Declaration with the 
specific purpose of preventing them becoming involved in enforced disappearances. 
Training should place emphasis on the importance of preventing and investigating enforced 
disappearance and recognizing the urgent need to resolve cases of enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p>54. The Working Group was also informed that courses in Chilean military history did 
not include references to the serious violations committed by members of the Armed Forces 
during the dictatorship. This is essential to ensure that future officers and non-
commissioned officers in the security forces are aware of the reprehensible and 
unjustifiable nature of these acts. 
</p><p>55. Furthermore, the information received suggests that there are still sectors of Chilean 
society that are unaware of the seriousness of the violations committed during the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> GE.13-10432 
</p>
<p>dictatorship, or try to justify them. More than 20 years after the return to democracy there is 
a new generation of Chileans who were born when the dictatorship was ending or under 
democracy. Therefore, State efforts must be strengthened to ensure that Chilean society 
always remembers, reflects upon and condemns the serious human rights violations 
committed by the dictatorship. 
</p>
<p>56. As an important preventive measure in relation to the custody and treatment of 
persons deprived of liberty, a national preventive mechanism must promptly be established 
in accordance with the obligations set forth in the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p>57. Under articles 10, 11 and 12 of the Declaration, deprivation of liberty must be 
carried out in strict compliance with national and international human rights standards in 
order to prevent enforced disappearances. The Working Group welcomed the information 
provided by the Carabineros concerning the existence of procedural protocols for the 
detention of persons, particularly in the cases of mass demonstrations. 
</p>
<p>58. The existing cooperation between the Carabineros and the Human Rights Institute is 
also noteworthy, as is the memorandum of understanding between the Carabineros and the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), signed on 18 January 2012 with a view 
to &#8220;updating, developing and promoting the integration of international human rights 
standards and applicable humanitarian principles in police work&#8221;. In the context of the 
recent mass movements of students and Mapuche indigenous people, the Working Group 
was informed that police procedures do not adequately distinguish between those who 
protest peacefully and those who engage in acts of violence. In fact, detention checks by 
Public Prosecution Service prosecutors are carried out on a very small proportion of 
individuals arrested at these demonstrations and very few of the detainees are effectively 
subjected to investigation and judicial proceedings. It was also noted that many police 
officers did not display their identification clearly and consistently, or refused to identify 
themselves during operations. The Working Group was informed that, in the event of 
collective detentions at public demonstrations, there were no standardized procedures and 
existing procedures were slow and disorganized. As a result, persons were kept in custody 
for many hours and were eventually released without charge and without having received 
any information on where or why they were being held. Information was also received that 
lawyers who did not belong to the Institute faced difficulties in attempting to interview 
persons arrested at public demonstrations and in exercising the right to a defence. There is 
reportedly no right to immediate defence or to information on the situation of detainees, and 
records are reportedly not presented to relatives with the necessary promptness. 
</p>
<p><b> IX. National Human Rights Institute 
</b></p>
<p>59. The National Human Rights Institute was established on 10 December 2009 and 
started work on 20 July 2010. The Institute plays an important and recognized role in the 
promotion and protection of human rights in relation to enforced disappearances. For 
example, the Working Group highlights the Institute&#8217;s recommendation to Congress 
regarding the ratification of the Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory 
Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity; its responsibility as custodian of 
the archives of the various truth commissions; and the inclusion of a chapter on serious 
human rights violations in its annual report. The Working Group also recognizes as a 
positive development the application for accreditation of the Institute under the Paris 
Principles. It also notes the initiatives to cooperate with and monitor the activities of the 
Carabineros. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.13-10432 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p><b> X. Enforced disappearances and the ethnic and gender 
perspective 
</b></p>
<p>60. Women were victims of enforced disappearance in Chile and were and remain at the 
forefront of the fight against this horrific practice. The Working Group was informed that 
activities related to enforced disappearance did not give due consideration to the gender 
perspective and that no particular attention was paid to the needs of women victims of 
enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p>61. The Rettig Report identified among the victims in the Araucan&#237;a region a group 
from the Mapuche community. It noted &#8220;the extreme harshness with which the Mapuche 
people and their families were treated and the difficulties arising, particularly in rural areas, 
from having to live &#8212; even to this day, in some cases &#8212; in the same locality as the 
officials who caused the deaths of their loved ones&#8221;. &#8220;As a result of fear, poverty or 
desperation, only a small percentage of these families brought cases, where appropriate, 
before the courts, or submitted complaints to human rights organizations.&#8221;3 Although the 
Report referred to individual cases of victims belonging to the Mapuche community, 
especially in the Lautaro area in 1974, it did not specifically focus on this subject. 
</p><p>62. State initiatives do not place emphasis on ethnic or gender issues. No specific 
method of gathering background information and gaining insight into the particular 
experiences of women or indigenous peoples has been identified. No efforts have been 
made to consider the implications of repression from that perspective either, nor have 
policies been designed for targeted reparations. 
</p>
<p><b> XI. Final comments 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Working Group appreciates the substantive information provided to it by the 
various authorities, civil society organizations, and associations of relatives and victims 
with a view to improving understanding of the issue of enforced disappearance in Chile. 
</p>
<p>64. Since the return to democracy very important steps have been taken to guarantee 
truth, justice, reparation, and memory in the context of the very serious human rights 
violations committed by the military dictatorship. The efforts of the various truth 
commissions have enormously increased knowledge of these violations. The financial 
reparations granted have reached amounts that would be difficult to equal in other parts of 
the world. Judicial investigations and convictions are important milestones in combating 
impunity for enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p>65. These developments have been achieved through the initiatives undertaken, 
promoted and carried out primarily by relatives of the victims or by civil society, as well as 
some State sectors. The State should show greater responsibility and leadership by ensuring 
that these initiatives are part of a comprehensive, coherent and consistent State policy. This 
would clearly reinforce the repudiation of disappearances and strengthen the foundations of 
a State that would never again allow serious human rights violations to be committed in its 
name. 
</p>
<p>66. However, important challenges remain in Chile, such as the fact that the Amnesty 
Decree-Law remains in force, the leniency of penalties for perpetrators, the slow progress

</p>
<p>of judicial proceedings, the continued use of military courts, even for cases of human rights 
violations, and the absence of a national plan to search for disappeared persons, inter alia. 
</p>
<p>67. The Working Group reiterates its solidarity with victims of enforced disappearance 
and their families. Their constant suffering is tangible evidence that enforced disappearance 
is a continuing crime and a permanent violation of human rights until the fate and 
whereabouts of the victim are clarified. The Working Group also recognizes the work of the 
numerous human rights defenders, NGOs, lawyers, judges and all those who work 
tirelessly, even in adverse conditions, to bring those responsible to justice and to preserve 
the memory of victims of this terrible practice. The Working Group therefore calls on the 
State to continue to support the work of these organizations. 
</p>
<p>68. The Working Group would welcome the opportunity to continue its constructive 
dialogue with the Chilean State and offers its assistance in fully implementing the 
Declaration. 
</p>
<p><b> XII. Recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>69. Based on the above considerations, the Working Group recommends that the 
Chilean State:

International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Define the offence of enforced disappearance as an ordinary offence in the Criminal 
Code and not exclusively as an international crime. The definition of enforced 
disappearance in criminal legislation should be consistent with that established in the 
Declaration and other relevant international instruments; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Render null and void the Amnesty Decree-Law as soon as possible in relation to all 
cases of enforced disappearance and other serious human rights violations 
committed during the dictatorship; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Establish an appropriate coordination mechanism with clearly defined 
responsibilities at every level of Government with a view to coordinating the 
activities of the different institutions involved in the prevention of disappearance and 
the search for disappeared persons, as well as in the investigation of cases of 
enforced disappearance; 
</p>
<p><b>  Recognition of victims 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; On behalf of the President of the Republic, send individual letters to the relatives of 
disappeared persons and executed persons recognized by the Valech II Commission 
as well as those recognized as victims by the previous Commissions, as a gesture of 
reparation; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Establish a permanent classification process allowing for victims of enforced 
disappearance to be recognized as such, and extend the corresponding right to 
reparation to their relatives; </p>

Rights Brigade of the Investigative Police, and the Human Rights Office of the 
Legal Aid Agency &#8212; this has to be set up in other cities and regions &#8212; in order to 
offer appropriate judicial and social support to relatives of victims and to fulfil the 
State&#8217;s obligation to investigate enforced disappearances seriously and promptly, 
being a matter that is not one exclusively for the judiciary or for individual initiative; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Establish a mechanism that allows for the appropriate review of benefits granted 
within the prison system to persons sentenced for enforced disappearance: due 
judicial oversight of benefits of all kinds; due regard for the particularly serious 
nature of the crime; guarantees of a transparent process and appropriate public 
information concerning the criteria used in granting these benefits and the particular 
reasons for their award in each case; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Investigate in the ordinary courts the enforced disappearance of the young Mapuche 
Jos&#233; Huenante; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Revise and amend domestic legislation so that the military jurisdiction, where it 
exists, is not competent to try cases of enforced disappearance or other human rights 
violations. In particular, the Carabineros of Chile must be subject to ordinary 
jurisdiction in the trial of any unlawful act committed by its members; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; For the Armed Forces, present all information available that may help clarify 
enforced disappearances or the identification of those responsible. In the event that 
the information is not available because it has been destroyed, serious and 
continuous efforts should be made to reconstruct it; 
</p>
<p><b>  Reparations 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Strengthen the Compensation and Comprehensive Health-Care and Human Rights 
Programme through technical guidance and a process of periodic evaluation and 
adjustment which takes into consideration the impact of the passage of time on 
individual situations and the new and particular needs arising among relatives of 
disappeared persons; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Take account of the fact that reparations under Act No. 19.123 and civil reparations 
in judicial proceedings are not mutually exclusive. Where appropriate, an exception 
for partial payment could be established; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Do not apply the statute of limitations and, in particular, the short time limits under 
the Civil Code in civil claims for cases of enforced disappearance; </p>

<p>&#8226; Reinforce the independence, resources and capacity of the National Human Rights 
Institute, in accordance with the Paris Principles; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Adopt measures to enhance the Institute&#8217;s visibility and boost its efficiency; 
</p>
<p><b>  Gender and ethnic perspective

enforced disappearance; 
</p>
<p><b>  Preventive measures 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Include information on human rights violations committed during the military 
dictatorship, including enforced disappearance, in programmes on the history of the 
military and the police; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Develop special information and awareness-raising campaigns on the extent of 
enforced disappearance committed during the dictatorship, and on the need to 
prevent it from ever recurring; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Include in the training of military personnel and Carabineros, as well as of medical 
personnel, State officials and other individuals involved in the custody or treatment 
of persons deprived of their liberty, the necessary education and information on the 
relevant provisions of the Declaration, with the specific purpose of preventing them 
becoming involved in enforced disappearances, emphasizing the importance of the 
prevention and investigation of enforced disappearance, and promoting the need to 
urgently resolve cases of enforced disappearance; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Regularly review the Carabineros&#8217; operational protocols for mass demonstrations 
and assess their practical application; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Immediately register all cases of deprivation of liberty during mass demonstration. 
In the case of minors, families must be notified as soon as possible; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Seriously investigate and appropriately punish any abuse committed by Carabineros 
during mass demonstration; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Adopt a National Human Rights Plan of Action; 
</p>
<p><b>  Memory 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Develop and distribute, through the Human Rights Programme, a clear protocol for 
approval of projects on memory and historical sites; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Strengthen efforts to preserve memory, through a mechanism ensuring that the State 
is constantly aware of the state of preservation of each memorial and memorial site 
and assigns budgetary resources for their effective preservation; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensure that Government ministers and the heads of the three Armed Forces visit 
museums and other memorial sites to demonstrate the State&#8217;s institutional 
commitment to memory and human rights. </p>
