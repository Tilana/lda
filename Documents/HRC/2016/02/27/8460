<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its tenth 
session from 24 January to 4 February 2011. The review of Estonia was held at the 15th 
meeting on 2 February 2011. The delegation of Estonia was headed by Alar Streimann, 
Secretary General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At its 17th meeting held on 4 
February 2011, the Working Group adopted the report on Estonia. 
</p>
<p>2. On 21 June 2010, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Estonia: Belgium, Ecuador, Zambia. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Estonia: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report/written presentation prepared in accordance with paragraph 
15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/10/EST/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/10/EST/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/10/EST/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, 
Germany, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom 
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Estonia through the troika. These 
questions are available on the extranet of the UPR site. 
</p>
<p><b> I.  Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation indicated that Estonia has been a committed member of the 
international community as a founding member of the League of Nations and a member of 
the United Nations, after restoration of its independence in 1991, as well as through its 
participation in human rights activities of other international and regional organizations.  
Estonia had acceded to 11 United Nations human rights instruments even before the entry 
into force of its Constitution, and had by then acceded to most of the major international 
and regional human rights agreements.  
</p>
<p>6. The delegation stated that the Manifest for All the Peoples of Estonia, which 
declared the independent Republic of Estonia in 1918, included a provision on the 
protection of the rights of ethnic minorities, which was also recognized after the 1991 
independence. It noted that a strong and engaged civil society was an essential part of 
Estonia&#8217;s actions to protect and promote human rights for all, and that freedom of 
expression was important to achieving that aim.  
</p>
<p>7. The delegation noted its close cooperation with the United Nations human rights 
treaty bodies, including through its recognition of the competence of the Human Rights 
Committee and the Committee on Elimination of Racial Discrimination to receive 
individual complaints. Estonia issued a standing invitation to all human rights special 
procedure mandate holders, and received visits from several special rapporteurs. Estonia 
has been working towards becoming a member of the Human Rights Council for the first </p>


<p>time so as to contribute particularly in achieving gender equality, freedom of expression 
and the rule of law. The delegation stated that Estonia considered the universal periodic 
review a unique process for improving the human rights situation, as well as an opportunity 
to exchange best practices. It thanked all the States that had submitted advance questions. 
</p>
<p>8. The integration of national minorities into Estonia&#8217;s multicultural society of more 
than 260 State-supported ethnic groups has been an integral part of its commitment to 
protect and promote human rights. Estonia has implemented a number of integration 
programmes since 2000, including the latest 2010-2013 programme developed in close co-
operation with representatives of ethnic minorities, which placed at its core equal 
opportunity and the involvement of all people, regardless of their ethnicity, in developing 
society, with particular attention to youth. Since 2009, the Ministry of Culture has been 
responsible for the implementation of the integration programme.  
</p>
<p>9. The delegation referred to its 2010 reports which indicate, inter alia, that contacts 
between residents of different ethnic origins has increased, and knowledge of Estonian 
among speakers of other languages has improved. The delegation also reported that the 
number of persons with undetermined citizenship had decreased from over 30 per cent in 
the 1990s to about 7 per cent today. Persons with undetermined citizenship enjoyed all 
political, civil, economic, social and cultural rights, and lacked only the right to vote in 
Parliamentary elections compared to Estonian citizens. 
</p>
<p>10. With regard to the promotion of gender equality, the delegation stated that Estonia 
had adopted a national action plan for the implementation of United Nations Security 
Council resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security for 2010&#8211;2014, which includes 
measures to increase awareness and knowledge of the gender perspective and women&#8217;s 
needs in conflict resolution. The delegation noted the establishment of the Gender Equality 
and Equal Treatment Commissioner, an independent and impartial expert who will monitor 
compliance with the provisions of law, advise Government institutions on the 
implementation of legislation, and receive complaints from individuals concerning 
discrimination.  
</p>
<p>11. The delegation referred to the results of the 2009 survey, and indicated that the 
general awareness of gender inequality was not very high, although the level of awareness 
had increased somewhat over the last four years. The results of the study were used to 
assess the existing gender-equality policy and to develop new policy measures where 
needed.   
</p>
<p>12. The delegation indicated a number of steps undertaken to combat domestic violence, 
including the review of the first results of the implementation of the National Action Plan 
for the Reduction of Violence (2010-2014), and criminalization of violation of a temporary 
restraining order. It also referred to Estonia&#8217;s ongoing efforts to fight against human 
trafficking, including several awareness-raising activities, provision of shelter and 
rehabilitation to victims, carried out in co-operation with women&#8217;s organizations and with 
increased financial support of the Government. 
</p>
<p>13. The role of women&#8217;s organizations as well as other non-governmental organizations 
has been constantly growing, and the government has supported capacity building of 
NGOs, as well as NGO-run gender-equality projects, through a programme funded jointly 
by the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Open Society Institute in Estonia. NGOs have 
been active in developing and implementing policies and programmes, as well as in 
preparing the national report for the universal periodic review. Moreover, Estonia plans to 
make the use of the internet forum a compulsory part of the development of any 
Government proposal, by making public every piece of legislation from the initial draft  
until its adoption.  </p>


<p>14. The delegation stressed that the pervasive use of electronic solutions in all areas had 
made an immense difference to society, and that the advantages of the digital era had 
stimulated people, regardless of their ethnic background, to take an active role in the 
governance of Estonia. 
</p>
<p>15. While referring to the recommendations concerning the establishment of a national 
human rights institution (NHRI), the delegation explained that the Chancellor of Justice 
already fulfils the role of a national human rights institution in compliance with the Paris 
Principles because the Chancellor of Justice was not part of the legislative, executive or 
judicial power. The independence of the Chancellor of Justice is provided for in the 
Constitution, and guaranteed by the appointment and dismissal procedure, a defined 
mandate and staff and budget requirements. The Chancellor has a wide range of 
competences to deal with the issues of fundamental rights. In addition to the functions of 
ombudsman, the Chancellor also supervises the constitutionality of legislation, and is 
entitled to give an opinion on any draft legislation. The Office of the Chancellor of Justice 
also fulfils the role of national preventive mechanism provided for in the Optional Protocol 
to the Convention against Torture (OP-CAT). 
</p>
<p>16. The delegation stated that Estonia had presented several reports on the 
implementation of international human rights treaties, and that the conclusions and 
recommendations concerning these reports have been translated and presented to the 
implementing institutions and other stakeholders, and published in the media. 
</p>
<p>17. Estonia has started preparations for ratifying several international human rights 
instruments, including the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), 
the UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education, the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (CED) and the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of 
children in armed conflict (OP-CRC-AC). 
</p>
<p>18. The delegation regarded the interactive dialogue as a valuable contribution to the 
domestic debate, and stated that it would be taken into account in drafting new action plans 
and legislation. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>19. During the interactive dialogue, 37 delegations made statements. A number of 
delegations welcomed the comprehensive presentation of the national report of Estonia. 
Several delegations also expressed their gratitude to Estonia for providing written responses 
to the advance questions. Recommendations made during the dialogue can be found in 
section II of the present report.  
</p>
<p>20. The Russian Federation stated that Estonia&#8217;s human rights policy was a failure. It 
said that Estonia encountered mass statelessness &#8211; 7 per cent of the population belonging to 
the Russian-speaking minority was stateless, and thus deprived of their basic rights. Other 
grave problems included the increase in the manifestation of neo-Nazism and xenophobia, 
attempts to glorify Nazi accomplices, public parades of the Waffen - SS legionaries with 
the participation of members of the Estonian Parliament, vandalism of monuments, 
persecution of veterans of the Great Patriotic War and Soviet governing bodies. The 
Russian Federation made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>21. Brazil noted the Gender Equality Act and the Equal Treatment Act. It referred to the  
concerns of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women about the 
lack of a specific law on domestic violence. Brazil was also concerned about discrimination 
against Roma. It encouraged Estonia to positively consider the recommendation of the 
Committee against Torture regarding protection of the rights of stateless persons and non-</p>


<p>citizens.  Brazil also highlighted the recommendation of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on the freedom of movement of asylum-seekers.  
Brazil made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>22. Algeria welcomed the establishment of the Chancellor of Justice and the 
Commissioner on Gender Equality. It also noted the adoption of plans and strategies for the 
promotion and protection of human rights. It asked about the measures taken by the 
Government to attenuate the impact of the recent economic and financial crisis on the 
enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. It also enquired about the measures taken 
to combat discrimination against women and linguistic minorities. Algeria made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>23. Finland asked about the measures taken to safeguard the implementation of the 
Equal Treatment Act in order to protect all persons against discrimination on the basis of 
nationality, race, colour, religion or other beliefs, age, disability or sexual orientation.

children for quality education, as well as Estonia&#8217;s intention to prohibit the use of corporal 
punishment. Finland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>24. The Republic of Moldova welcomed the commitment of the Government towards 
the World Programme on Human Rights Education, and noted that human rights education 
was part of the core curricula in primary and secondary education. It noted with satisfaction 
Estonia efforts to combat trafficking in human beings but expressed concern regarding the 
cases of child prostitution and pornography. It referred to the issue of equal representation 
of women in national bodies. The Republic of Moldova made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>25. Morocco welcomed the priority given by the Government to integration in society. It 
commended Estonia for its efforts regarding the adoption of measures for gender equality. 
It welcomed Estonia&#8217;s commitment to human rights and humanitarian action, as 
demonstrated particularly through its voluntary contributions to various funds. Morocco 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>26. Belgium welcomed the positive measures taken regarding gender equality and equal 
treatment. However, it noted with concern the lack of a global and coherent approach in 
these measures. It asked about a national plan of action aimed at reducing gender 
inequalities and raising public awareness in this regard, as well as the measures taken to 
reduce the salary gap between men and women. Belgium asked about the measures taken to 
strengthen respect for diversity, and to combat discrimination against homosexuals. 
Belgium made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>27. Lithuania stated that it shared the same historical experience as Estonia, and 
considered Estonia&#8217;s development of a human rights protection and promotion system, in 
the short period of 20 years, a major achievement. It indicated that while there were areas 
where additional attention was still needed, the general thrust of policies and practice, 
which was firmly oriented towards further advancement of human rights, must be 
recognized.  Lithuania made recommendations.   
</p>
<p>28. Thailand commended Estonia for its commitment to promote and protect human 
rights through education and training. Thailand welcomed the entry into force of the Equal 
Treatment Act and hoped for its full implementation. Thailand noted the standing invitation 
extended to all special procedures and enquired about the follow-up given to the 
recommendations received from the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography. Thailand made recommendations.   
</p>
<p>29. Slovenia was concerned by the reports that mentally disabled persons and/or their 
legal guardians were often denied the right to be informed about criminal proceedings and 
charges against them. Slovenia also noted that Roma children continued to be placed in </p>


<p>specialized schools for disabled children, although they were not disabled.  The right to 
vote has also been denied to persons deprived of their legal capacity, and disability 
pensions/benefits were inadequate and low. Slovenia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>30. Canada commended Estonia for its engagement in combating trafficking in human 
beings and for signing the Council of Europe&#8217;s Convention on Action against Trafficking in 
Human Beings. It welcomed Estonia&#8217;s efforts to improve the integration of immigrants and 
refugees. It noted positively the efforts to prevent family violence through the adoption of 
the Development Plan for the Reduction of Violence. It also welcomed the fact that Estonia 
has signed CRPD, and encouraged Estonia to ratify and implement it. Canada made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>31. Poland expressed appreciation for the measures taken by Estonia to develop its 
institutional and legal human rights infrastructure. Poland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>32. Ghana noted that none of Estonia&#8217;s institutions dealing with the protection of human 
rights was accredited by the International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions 
for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights. Ghana welcomed the steps taken to 
address discrimination, however, highlighted the concern of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women about the delay in establishing the Gender 
Equality Council. Finally, Ghana applauded Estonia&#8217;s commitment to secure the protection 
of children, and made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>33. The Czech Republic was concerned about allegations of brutality and excessive use 
of force by law enforcement personnel. Czech Republic made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland encouraged Estonia to 
ensure full implementation of the Equal Treatment Act in the spheres of employment, 
education, prisons and health care. It asked for further information on equal rights for 
disabled persons and discrimination on the basis of race or sexual orientation. It encouraged 
Estonia to expand the work and funding of the Chancellor of Justice and the Commissioner 
for Gender Equality and Equal Treatment. The United Kingdom made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. The delegation stated that Estonia had started the preparations for ratification of 
CRPD, as well as considered ratifying OP-CRC-AC and the UNESCO Convention against 
Discrimination in Education. Estonia may consider ratifying OP-CEDAW, but it has not yet 
considered ratifying the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All 
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (ICRMW), the European Charter on 
Regional or Minority Languages, nor Protocol no. 12 to the European Convention for the 
Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. 
</p>
<p>36. Regarding the establishment of an NHRI, the delegation stated that Estonia 
considered the mandate of the Chancellor of Justice largely in conformity with the Paris 
Principles, therefore Estonia did not envisage establishing a new national human rights 
institution, but would expand the mandate of the Chancellor of Justice to fully meet the 
Paris Principles. Estonia did not consider establishing a special Ombudsman on national 
minorities as the issue of discrimination against national minorities could be addressed by 
the Chancellor of Justice or the Commissioner for Gender Equality and Equal Treatment. 
</p>
<p>37. Estonia has extended an invitation to all its permanent residents to become citizens.  
In the case of children, Estonia respects the free choice of parents, and parents often choose 
Estonian citizenship for their newborn children.  
</p>
<p>38. Regarding to the issue of political party membership for non-citizens, the delegation 
explained that according to the Constitution, the exercise of political power was an 
entitlement of citizens only, therefore it would not be possible to ensure the right of access 
to membership of a political party to those who do not hold Estonian citizenship. It was  </p>


<p>advisable that non-citizens obtain Estonian citizenship in order to become a member of a 
political party.  
</p>
<p>39. Malaysia noted with encouragement Estonia&#8217;s emphasis on socio-economic 
development, which has contributed to the Government&#8217;s ability to promote and protect 
human rights. It noted Estonia&#8217;s commitment to advancing women&#8217;s rights and enquired 
about the status of the study on the gender-income gap undertaken by the Government, and 
its future actions in this regard. Malaysia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>40. Referring to the concerns expressed by the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women and the Committee against Torture on violence against 
women, Denmark thanked Estonia for elaborating on the measures taken, and was pleased 
that Estonia intended to continue efforts to ensure de facto equality between women and 
men. Denmark noted the concern of the Committee against Torture over the excessive use 
of force by law enforcement personnel, and asked about Estonia&#8217;s follow-up. Denmark 
encouraged Estonia to take further measures to overcome the issue of statelessness and 
language restrictions of the Russian-speaking minority. Denmark made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>41. Germany commended Estonia on its Integration Strategy for 2008-2013 and its 
cooperation with the European Union (EU) and the Organization for Security and Co-
operation in Europe (OSCE) in addressing the question of the Russian-speaking minority. It 
thanked the delegation for its clarification on the implementation of the Integration 
Strategy. Germany welcomed the comprehensive policy on trafficking, in particular the 
Victim Support Act, and asked for details on the guidelines and handbook published in this 
regard, and suggested that they be shared with interested stakeholders. Germany made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. Norway supported the steps taken to strengthen the command of the Estonian 
language among the non-Estonian-speaking population. Norway positively noted the 
introduction of the Gender Equality Act and the establishment of the Commissioner for 
Gender Equality and Equal Treatment, however, it noted that financial and human 
resources to effectively carry out responsibilities under the Act were lacking. Norway also 
noted that Estonia did not have a specific legal act against human trafficking. Norway made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>43. The Netherlands commended Estonia for appointing a Commissioner for Gender 
Equality and Equal Treatment, but noted its lack of resources as well as persisting gender 
disparities. It welcomed the decision of the Government to include a prohibition of 
discrimination based on sexual orientation in the Equal Treatment Act. It took note of the 
efforts to advance the integration of minorities into Estonian society, in particular the 
Russian-speaking minority. The Netherlands made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>44. Spain recognized Estonia&#8217;s commitment to protecting the rights of its national 
minorities. It welcomed Estonia&#8217;s efforts to combat gender violence, in particular the Plan 
for the Reduction of Violence, as well as the efforts to combat discrimination on the 
grounds of gender identity and sexual orientation. It enquired about the supervision 
methods of the body in charge of &#8220;Language Inspection&#8221;. It also asked about the measures 
taken to reduce the number of stateless persons. Spain made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>45. France noted Estonia&#8217;s intention to accede to CRPD, and asked about the possible 
obstacles to the prompt ratification of this instrument, which was signed by Estonia in 
</p><p>2007. France noted that stateless persons represented 8 per cent of the population, and 
asked about the measures taken to encourage these persons living on a permanent basis in 
Estonia to obtain Estonian citizenship. France made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>46. Turkey praised Estonia&#8217;s transition to democracy following its regaining of 
independence in 1991. Turkey appreciated the new Equal Treatment Act and hoped for its </p>


<p>full implementation together with the Gender Equality Act. Turkey encouraged Estonia to 
continue the naturalization process by providing the necessary assistance to citizenship 
applicants. Turkey also welcomed Estonia&#8217;s efforts to combat human trafficking and to 
protect the rights of children. Turkey made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>47. Argentina welcomed the measures taken to address discrimination against 
minorities. It commended Estonia&#8217;s achievements with regard to human rights education in 
primary and secondary school curricula, and training for civil servants. It noted with 
appreciation the measures taken to combat gender violence. Argentina made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>48. Latvia noted with interest the transition from Russian-speaking schools to partial 
instruction in Estonian, and considered that this model of bilingual education was effective 
for improving the knowledge of the State language, guaranteeing equal study and working 
opportunities for graduates, while supporting their ethnic identity. It acknowledged that the 
implementation of Estonia&#8217;s integration policy had brought positive changes in society, and 
played an important role in creating tolerance and diversity. Latvia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>49. Austria applauded Estonia for its efforts to curb trafficking in human beings, and 
asked about the focus of Estonia&#8217;s future action in this regard. Austria enquired about the 
penitentiary system and Estonia&#8217;s efforts to improve detention conditions.  Austria was 
concerned about discrimination on the basis of ethnicity, especially against the Roma 
community, in realms of education, employment, and culture. Austria asked about measures 
to combat prejudices faced by the Roma.  Austria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>50. Azerbaijan welcomed Estonia&#8217;s voluntary contribution to international human rights 
and humanitarian-related organizations. It highlighted Estonia&#8217;s cooperation with the 
United Nations human rights procedures. It noted the Development Plan for the Reduction 
of Violence, aimed at preventing violence against women and domestic violence, and 
welcomed the adoption of the Strategy for Guaranteeing the Rights of Children. It 
commended the measures taken to prevent trafficking in human beings. Azerbaijan made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>51. Hungary welcomed human rights education and training as part of the Estonian 
national curriculum. Hungary noted the steps taken towards gender equality, and women 
and children&#8217;s rights, but was concerned about the lack of resources of the Gender Equality 
Commissioner, and the definition of torture in the Penal Code. Hungary noted the increased 
cases of human trafficking. Hungary enquired about plans to ratify the Convention against 
Stateless Persons and to ease naturalization requirements. Hungary made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. China commended the Equal Treatment Act as an important step for social justice 
and the fight against discrimination. Though still faced with issues such as citizenship and 
integration of non-citizens, thanks to nearly two decades of efforts, Estonia has made 
considerable progress for social cohesion. Estonia has also formulated relevant strategies 
and measures to promote the right to work and the rights of the child and the elderly, and to 
combat human trafficking. China made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>53. The Government planed to strengthen measures to ensure gender equality. It has 
started implementing the new programme to promote gender equality for 2010&#8211;2013, 
which includes awareness-raising initiatives targeting employees and employers. Estonia 
has also joined the Europe-wide community of practice on gender equality. The delegation 
acknowledged the lack of resources available to the Commissioner on Gender Equality and 
Equal Treatment. To address this issue, the Ministry of Social Affairs, in cooperation with 
the Commissioner, has implemented joint projects. </p>


<p>54. The delegation stated that sexual minorities was included as a target group in the 
Ministry of Social Affairs&#8217; development plan in the past two years. Estonia had carried out 
awareness-raising campaign on the rights of sexual minorities with some successful impact. 
</p>
<p>55. The Government supported the active participation of persons with disabilities in 
public life through the provision of relevant services. Social welfare programs were in place 
to assist persons with disabilities in overcoming the difficulties they faced.  
</p>
<p>56. Amendments to the Penal Code were developed to bring it in line with international 
law and would be introduced to the Parliament for adoption in 2011. The amendments aim, 
inter alia, to bring the crime of hate speech in line with international standards, make 
ethnic, racist and religious hatred an aggravating circumstance, and include the specific 
crime of human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>57. In April 2010, a development plan on reducing violence for 2010-2014 came into 
force, which defines activities and responsibilities of various agencies to combat all forms 
of violence in society. The plan specifically targets violence against children, violence 
committed by children, domestic violence and human trafficking, and includes various 
measures to combat family violence and human trafficking. Estonia has adopted a holistic 
approach to combating domestic violence and all forms of violence and thus, no specific 
provision had been envisaged to address domestic violence.  
</p>
<p>58. Slovakia commended Estonia&#8217;s cooperation with the United Nations human rights 
mechanism and its particular engagement in the area of women&#8217;s rights. It welcomed the 
establishment of mechanisms for dialogue with minority groups, including the Council of 
Ethnic Minorities, the Roundtable of Nationalities and the Integration Strategy. It noted the 
possible lack of access to the asylum procedure and the lack of clear grounds for accepting 
or rejecting an application for an alternative to military service. Slovakia made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59. The United States commended Estonia&#8217;s leadership in establishing the United 
Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women) and the 
Action Plan to implement Security Council resolution 1325. The United States welcomed 
Estonia&#8217;s commitment to fight trafficking in persons and its support for victims, and 
enquired about the enactment of legislation on trafficking in persons. The United States 
welcomed the gender equality measures but remained concerned about the pay gap between 
men and women. The United States enquired about the long-term plan to improve 
conditions for detainees and about the civil society development plan. The United States 
made recommendations.    
</p>
<p>60. Bosnia and Herzegovina noted that the issue of trafficking in human beings was a 
challenge that Estonia faced, and asked Estonia to elaborate on the legislation, practice, and 
steps taken within the scope of regional cooperation.  It also noted that Estonia did not have 
a national human rights institution accredited by the International Coordinating Committee.  
It commended Estonia for the steps taken to improve the status of women, however, noted 
that gender inequality persisted. Bosnia and Herzegovina made recommendations.   
</p>
<p>61. Chile appreciated Estonia&#8217;s commitment to promoting and protecting human rights, 
and highlighted that the recommendations and conclusions of the Human Rights Committee 
had been made public through the media. It welcomed Estonia&#8217;s intentions to ratify various 
international human rights instruments, and commended the promulgation of the Law on 
Equal Treatment which guarantees protection for all persons against discrimination, and 
establishes a Commissioner for Gender Equality and Equal Treatment. Chile made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>62. Ecuador noted the challenges that Estonia faced, and highlighted the need to address 
the issue of stateless persons. Ecuador requested information about the Foundation for </p>


<p>Integration and Immigration, &#8220;Our People&#8221;, particularly whether there was any Government 
participation, and if the Foundation depended on any governmental authority. Ecuador 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. Sweden noted that Estonia&#8217;s law and judiciary provided effective means for 
addressing individual instances of abuse. Estonia had made an effort to replace some of the 
older prisons, however, there were still reports of poor conditions in some of Estonia&#8217;s 
prisons. Sweden also welcomed the steps taken to combat discrimination, such as the Equal 
Treatment Act, and improved and free access to Estonian-language classes. Sweden made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>64. Australia commended Estonia for action taken against human trafficking and 
welcomed the entry into force of the Equal Treatment Act in 2009. However, Australia 
remained concerned over ongoing discrimination based on language and gender. Australia 
welcomed initiatives to reduce crime among youth, and to decrease the number of prisoners 
in detention, but remained concerned at the treatment of prisoners in Estonia. Australia 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. The Islamic Republic of Iran noted the Government&#8217;s positive achievements at the 
national level. It expressed concern at the alarming levels of human trafficking, the degree 
of racial discrimination, xenophobia and other related intolerance against racial, linguistic 
and ethnic groups &#8211; especially the Roma, violence against women, sexual exploitation of 
children, the excessive use of force by law enforcement personnel, and the holding of 
detainees in poor conditions. The Islamic Republic of Iran made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. The delegation stated that the Integration Strategy has resulted in positive changes 
by creating tolerance and maintaining ethnic diversity in society. Estonia has implemented 
integration programmes since 2000. The new strategy was adopted in 2008 for the period 
2008-2013, and covers three main areas: education and culture; social and economic; and 
legal and political. One of the main goals of the strategy is to increase contacts among 
people of different cultural backgrounds, and increase the participation of minorities in 
political and economic affairs. The plans for implementing the strategy had been developed 
with various stakeholders, and targets specifically youth, unemployment issues of 
minorities, and social exclusion. Various consultative bodies on minority issues that 
function at the State and regional levels, include representatives of national minorities.  
</p>
<p>67. A number of media outlets broadcast in Russian throughout the country, including 
the Estonian Public Broadcasting with a news portal in Russian, Radio 4 which offers 
programmes in Russian, ETV 2 which broadcasts partially in Russian, as well as some 
commercial channels in the Russian language. There are also one daily, and five weekly 
newspapers as well as a number of journals which are published in Russian.  
</p>
<p>68. Regarding the issue of unemployment among the Russian-speaking minorities, the 
delegation reported that special initiatives had been taken as a part of the integration 
programme to facilitate their access to the labour market, including consultancy on how to 
start a business, and specially designed language training courses. 
</p>
<p>69. The delegation stated that it was possible to use other languages, such as Russian, in 
police stations, medical institutions, social services and local governments, as well as in 
banks and businesses. In some regions, local governments also provide services in other 
languages. Additionally, Estonian language courses are provided for minorities, and 4,000 
persons participated in such courses in 2010. 
</p>
<p>70. Regarding the concern expressed about the work of the language inspectors, the 
delegation reported that the language inspectors&#8217; work was regulated by legislation and that 
the inspectors carried out monitoring visits to inspect language proficiency in workplaces in 
cooperation with representatives of the employers and municipal councils. </p>


<p>71. Estonia provides inclusive and high-quality education. Students&#8217; learning progress 
and results in schools are high, regardless of their economic background.  
</p>
<p>72. Regarding questions raised about the Roma community, the delegation stated that 
Estonia had a small number of Roma &#8211; about 500 persons, according to data of the last 
census. However, Estonia acknowledged that the Roma faced some problems. Estonia does 
not have segregated schools, and Roma students can only be placed in special schools with 
the consent of their parents or legal guardians. Some steps have been taken to address drop-
out among Roma students, including training for teachers and heads of schools on cultural 
differences.  
</p>
<p>73. Regarding the question about violence against children and child abuse, the 
delegation explained that violence against children was prohibited by the Penal Code, and 
the principle of non-violent child-raising was also mentioned in the Family Law Act. The 
Ministry of Social Affairs was in the process of amending the Child Protection Act, and the 
amendments would ban corporal punishment explicitly. Estonia has carried out awareness-
raising campaigns to address the issue of the corporal punishment.   
</p>
<p>74. The delegation stated that all asylum-seekers were provided access to legal aid at 
every stage of the asylum procedure, which was carried out in line with the State Legal Aid 
Act. Additionally, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, together with an NGO, has implemented 
a pilot project  to provide legal aid by lawyers specialized in asylum law. Another NGO has 
already provided legal aid and represented asylum-seekers both in the administrative 
procedures and in court. Translation and interpretation were also granted free of charge to 
all applicants. Asylum-seekers are also allowed to practice their religions freely. While the 
number of applicants has been small in the past, there is a tendency to increase.  
</p>
<p>75. The delegation stated that the issue of stateless persons was a serious challenge, and 
that Estonia has done its best to address the issue, and continues to work to achieve further 
progress in this area. The delegation stated that the phenomena of neo-Nazism did not exist 
in Estonia, and that the events in which people pay their respect to those who died in the 
war should not be seen as acts of neo-Nazism.  
</p>
<p>76. In conclusion, the delegation thanked the Working Group for the open dialogue and 
for comments and suggestions provided by the States. It hoped that in the subsequent cycles 
of the UPR, Estonia would be in a position to report about progress made in implementing 
the recommendations put forward by the delegations during the interactive dialogue. 
Estonia planed to put forward its candidacy for membership in the Human Rights Council 
in 2012 in order to continue contributing to human rights work.
