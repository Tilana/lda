</p>
<p>*  Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Taking note also </i>of the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
on the composition of the staff of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (A/HRC/10/45), 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note further</i> of the reports of the Joint Inspection Unit on the follow-up to the 
management review of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(A/59/65-E/2004/48 and Add.1) and on the funding and staffing of the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (JIU/REP/2007/8), 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>that an imbalance in the composition of the staff could diminish the 
effectiveness of the work of the Office of the High Commissioner if it is perceived to be 
culturally biased and unrepresentative of the United Nations as a whole, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the importance of continuing the ongoing efforts to address the imbalance 
regarding the regional representation of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner, 
</p>
<p><i> Underlining</i> that the paramount consideration for employing staff at every level is the need 
for the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity, and taking into account 
Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, expressing its conviction that this 
objective is compatible with the principle of equitable geographical distribution,  
</p>

</p>
<p> 2. <i>Notes</i> the increase in the percentage of staff from regions identified as requiring

imbalance in geographical distribution of the staff, while stressing that the imbalance in 
geographical distribution is still prominent;  </p>

staff from each region be directly proportional to the percentage of United Nations Member 
States of the given region; 
</p>

of regions already over-represented in the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for

</p>
<p> 6. <i>Welcomes</i> the efforts towards the achievement of a gender balance in the 
composition of the staff and the decision to continue paying special attention to this issue; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Requests</i> future High Commissioners to continue enhancing the ongoing efforts in 
the fulfilment of the goal of a geographical balance in the composition of the staff of the Office;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Underlines </i>the importance of continuing promoting geographical diversity in the 
recruitment of, and promotion to high-level and Professional posts, including senior managers, as 
a principle of the staffing policies of the Office of the High Commissioner; 
</p>

the significance of national and regional specificities and various historic, cultural and religious 
backgrounds, as well as of different political, economic and legal systems, to the promotion and 
protection of the universality of human rights;  
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Recalls </i>the provisions contained in section X, paragraph 3, of General Assembly 
resolution 55/258 of 14 June 2001 on human resources management, in which the Assembly 
reiterated its request to the Secretary-General to increase further his efforts to improve the 
composition of the Secretariat by ensuring a wide and equitable geographical distribution of staff 
in all departments; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 11. <i>Encourages </i>the General Assembly to consider further measures for promoting 
desirable ranges of geographical balance in the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner 
representing national and regional specificities, various historic, cultural and religious 
backgrounds, as well as the diversity of political, economic and legal systems;  
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Welcomes </i>the significant increase in the human and financial resources allocated to 
the activities of the Office of the High Commissioner, and the impact it should have on the 
geographic composition of the Office; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Recognizes </i>the importance of the follow-up to and implementation of 
General Assembly resolution 61/159 of 19 December 2006, and underlines the priority

the Council in 2010, in accordance with its annual programme of work, following the structure 
and scope of her report and with a special focus on further measures taken to correct the 
imbalance in geographical composition of the staff of the Office.
