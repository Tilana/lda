Strategy

nurstrategy isto enhance shareholdervalue through consistent grorvth in cash ﬂows by focusing on the organic development ofour existing assets
within oiireore areas. we also look for opportunities to diversify and build upon our current portfolio through the ucquisition ofudditional iineonventionul
and conventional assets with a focus on lexas. Key components ofourbusiness strategy include the following.

minim siriiivgit» t1an aptiriiiionrrl Arlvanirrgos by Being a “trim Mover " we seek to be one ofthe ﬁrst oil and gas companies to identify new
unconventional shale trends. LaZzI has established a track record ofidentifying successful emerging plays, including those in Dewitt, Eavaca, Gonzalez and
Fayette counties in South 1'0an and the Eagle Ford East trend in East Texas. Being one ofthe ﬁrst enterprises to aequire siibstuntial properties in a new oil
and gus ploy oﬁeis several operational and strategic advantages, Speeiﬁcally, being a “Hrsl Mover“ deereases ourucreuge ucquisition eosts. increases our
ability to acquirc contiguous acreage, limits opportunities foroureempetitors and increases ouruttiaetiveness as ujoint venture partncr. Ourmanugcincm
intends to continue to aequire working interests in both prospective acreage and producing wells when the opportunity arises and to do so at attractive
valiiutions.

Ker/wed aptiriiiionrrl Cam and Risk “trough .lm'm Voniures. we have been able to eontrol operational and capital costs by entering into joint
ventures forthe operation ofourproperties wilh lurgerpetroleiiin exploration and production companies. Suehtoint venture partners have the eupital
resources to advanee the unconventional drilling programs that are necessary to develop shale pluys. Addilmnally.joln[ ventiires allow foru lower
proponionute risk ofloss to our shareholders in the event ofan unsueeessfiil well. while the Company intends to assume a greuter opemtionul role vvith
respeet to ourassets, the use ofjoint ventures increases oiirability to deploy eapital on the evuluation and acquisition ofnevvprojeets.

meCmI UpEl'lxlm‘ LaZzI has served as the operatorofzu wells. and its experieneed teehnicul team has worked closely with Hess and E00 in the
drilling ofour wells operated by those companies. Collectively, laZa’s technical teuin has punicipated in the drilling ofthousands ofvvells overthe course
oftheircareeis. The Company expeets to leverage this experience by mzunlalning more opemtionul control in its new ventures. in doing so. LaZn’s
engineering team is focused on reducing well costs and being a low-cost. highly cf'ﬁcicnl operatorofits new wells.

Mrrinirrin I‘Tmlllll'a] I-‘Iexilnlily, we continue to tuke proactive steps to streamline and strengthen the Company's bulanee sheet to maintain the
finaneial flexibility needed to provide consistent reserves growth. We have utilized capital murkets to sueeessfully eomplete debt and equity transuctions
and realized shareholdervalue by monetizing assets,

2015 Outlook

Beginning in 20] 5, ana has the right to propose new development wells in speeiﬁe locations and maintain its desired minimum drilling pace,
Following its teehnieul evaluation and on internal acreage high—grading euinpaign focused on vertical coinmingled development (Buda-Rose “stack and
fines"), the Company has identiﬁed approximutely 300 well locutions on the basis nfSO-zlcrc spacing, During the ﬁrst quarter ofzms. the Company
proposed the ﬁrst two Budnrkosc vertical vvells in a 16-well Vcrllczll eommingled development program to be located in Madison and wulker Colmllcs. Each
proposed well is estimated to cost approximutely $3.5 million and estimated to deliver an internal rate ofretum ofapproximutely 40% at Fcbmary 2015

exists in lexas. almost all pooling results fromvoluntary aetion by oil and gas lessees exercising the authority to pool granted in the oil and gas lease. in
Texas, the forced pooling ofimleased mineral owners, oroflessors wherc a right to pool is not provided for in the lease. requires applieation to, and approval

General. Ouragreements with our joint venture partners require iisto bearourproportionate cost ofcomplianee and liabilities tvith rcspect to the
extensive federal. state and local lavvs and regulations relating to the protection ofthe environment and the generation. storage, handling. emission,

with such laws and regulations to the extent we operate and D\\tﬂ100% ofa property, Govemment regulations can increase the cost and timing ofplanning,
designing, installing and operating oil and gas vvells and otherfacilities. Additionally, certain environmental pertnits arc required foroil and gas operations.
These permits ean be revoked, modified or renevved by issuing authorities, Governmental authorities can enforce compliance vvith their regulations throiigh
fines. injunctions orboth. Although we believe that eompliance with the currcnl environmental rcgulations applicable to our operationswill not have a
material adverse efTect on us, it is possible that otherdevelopments, sueh as strieterenvironmental laws and regulations, and claims fordamagesto property
orpersons resulting from oil and gas production could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us.

us. lavvs and rcgulations applicable to our operations include those controlling the discharge ofhazardous materials into the environment,
requiring removal and cleanup ofmaterials that may harm the environment orothervvise relating to the protection ofthe environment,

Solid and Hazardous wirtre, We currently own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, niimerous properties that were used for the production
ofoil and gas for many years. Although operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time may have been utilized, it is possible
that hydroearbons nrolhcrwaslcs may have been disposed oforreleased on orunderthe properties currently owned or leased by us or oiirjomt ventures.
State and federal laws applicable to oil and gas musics and properties have beeome stricter overtime. Underthese mereasmgly stringent requirements. we or
our joint ventures could be required to remove orremediate previously disposed wastes tincliiding vvastes disposed orrcleased by prior ovvners and npclalersl
orclean up property eontamination (including groundwatcrconlaminallon by priorowners or operators) orto perform plugging operations to prevent future
contaminallon.

nuropeiations generate some hazardous wastes that are already subject to the ledeial Resource Conservation and Reeovery Act (“RCRA”) and
comparable state statutes. The Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”| has limited the disposal options forcertain hazardous tvastes. it is possible that
certain vmstes eunently exempt fromtrcatment as hazardous vvastes may in the future be designated as hazardous musics under RCRA orotherapplicable
statutes. oiir operations could. thereforc. be subjeet to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements in the future than we encounter today.

Superrund, lhe Comprehensive bnvironmental Response. Compensation. and Liabillly Act (CERCLA). also known as the “Superfund” law. and
comparable state laws and regulations impose liability, without regard to ﬁull orthe legality ofthe original conduet, on certain persons vvith respeet to the
release ofhazardous siibstanees into the environment, l hese persons include the cur-rent and past owners and operators ofa site vvherc the release oeeurred
and any party that treated ordisposed oforarranged forthe treatment ordisposal ofhazardous siibstanees found at a Site. UndchERCLA. such persons may
be subtect to joint and several strict liability forthe costs ofcleaning up the hazardous siibstaneesthat have been rcleased into the environment, fordamages
to natural resources and for the eosts ofeertam health studies, CERCLA also authorizes the EPA, and in some cases. private parties, to undertake actions to
clean up such hazardous substances. orto rccoverthe costs ofsuch actions fromthe rcsponsible parties, in addition. it is not uncommon forneighbormg
landowners and otherthird parties to file elaims forpersonal Injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the
environment. ln the eourse ofbusmess, we and oiirjomt ventures have used materials and generated musics and will eontmue to use materials and generate
wastesthat may fall within CERCLA’S definition ofhazardous substances. We may also be an ovvneror operatorofsites on which hazardous substances have
been rcleased. As a result, we or oiirjomt ventures may be responsible undchERCLA for all orpart ofthe coststo clean up sites where sueh substances have
been rcleased.

We require signiﬁcant cupitul expunrtirurer to conduct our business and we may have dimculty in obtaining such eupirul.

Ourexploration. development. and acquisition aetivities require substantial eapital expenditures, We have sold assets and ineurred indebtedness in
orderto provide capital to earry out ouracllvillcs. Forcxzunplc, we sold the Moulton acreage during the second and third quancrofzols, Currently. our
mator source ofmeomc is from ourjoint ventures‘ eari-icd interest and produetion, Our cash ﬂow from operations and access to capital are subject to a
number ofvariablesthat may ormay not be ivithm ourcontrol.inc1uding:

- the level ofoil and gas that ts produced from existing wells on ourpropenies.

- the prices at which our oil and gas production is sold.

. the operators in ourjoint venture‘s ability to develop the proved and unproved reserves;

- ourability to acquire. loeate and produce new economically recoverable reserves;

- global credit and seeunties markets. and

. the ability and willingness oflenders and investors to provide capital and the cost ofthat capital.

We will need to raise capital to purchase new oil and gas leases and to fully explore and analyze leases that we have already purehased, We intend
to pursue various strategies to raise capital, including asset sales. debt orcquity financing, andjoim ventures. Forcxamplc. in ScptcmbchﬂM, we sold
6,0110 net acres ofundeveloped leases in ourEast '1‘exas JVto an nfﬁlialc onuantum Energy Partners forapproximately $11 million in cash and the
Company‘s right to receive Quantum‘s interest in eertain future wells. lfwe are unable to sell assets or iffinaneing andjomt venture partnerships are not

qulurt: to obtain the capital to fully explore ourpropertics eould lead to possible write-downs in the carrying value ofourpropertics, a material
decline in ouroil and gas reserves as well as ourrevenues and results ofoperations, The ﬁllurt: to obtain additional eapital could also materially adversely

We conduet substantially all ofouropcrationsthrough joint ventures with third parties, and as a result, the continuation ofsuchgtoint ventures is
vital to our continued success. We may also enter into otherjoint venture arrangements in the future. 1n many instances we depend on these third parties for
elements ofthese arrangements that are important to the sueeess ofthejoint venture, such as agreed payments ofsubstantial development costs pertaining to
thejoint venture and their share ofother costs ofthejoint venture. The performance ofthese third party obligations orthe ability ofthird parties to meet their
obligations underthese arrangements is outside ourcontrol. 1fthese parties do not meet or satisfy theirobligations underthese arrangements.the
performance and success ofthese arrangements. and theirvalue to us. may be adversely nffcclcd. 1fourcurrent or futurcgtoint venture partners are unable to

lhe results ofourdrilling in new oremerging formations, sueh as the Eagle l-ord and Eagle l-ord East trends. are more uncertain tnittally than
drilling results tn areasthat are developed and have established production. Beeause netv oremergtng formations have limited orno production history. we
are less able to use past drilling results tn those areas to help predict future drilling results Furlhu, part ofthe strategy ofourjoint ventures tn the bagle Ford
and Eagle Ford East trends involve the use ofhorizontal drilling and eompletion teehntques that have been successful tn other shale formations. Although
we and ourjotnt venture partners have experienee with horizontal drilling tn these areas.the oil and gas industry‘s drilling and produetton htstory ts ltrnited
when eompared to conventional techniques. The ultimate sueeess ofthese drilling and completion techniques will be better evaluated overtime as more
wells are drilled and produetton proﬁles are betterestablished.

lfthe drilling results ofouroperattons are lessthan anticipated orare impacted by eapital eonstratnts ofus oreufgleinl venture partners, lease

nursuccess wlll depend on the results ofthe exploration. development and produetion activtties on ourproperties. and the properties that we may
aequtre. Oil and gas exploration, development and produetton aettvittes are subtect to numerous risks beyond ourcontrol, including the risk that drilling
will not result in commereially viable oil orgas produetton, Decisions to pttrehase. explore. develop orothenvise exploit prospeets orproperties will depend
tn part on the evaluation ofdata obtained through geophysieal and geologieal analyses. produetton data, and engineering studies, the rcsulls ofwhtch are
often inconelusive or inaeeurate or subteet to varying interpretations oruncertainty. Costs ofdrilling. completing and operating wells are often uncertain
before drilling eommences. Overruns tn budgeted expenditures are common risks that ean make a partieular project uneeonomical. Furthermore. many
faetors may eunatl. delay oreaneel drilling, and sueh work stoppage may not be covered by ourtnsuranee. including:

- pressure or irregulartties in geological formations.

- shortages ofordelays tn obtaining drilling equipment. services and supplies and qualiﬁed personnel.

0ur estimates ofnii ana gas reserves invnive inherent uncertainty, which could materiain atfeet the quantity and vaiue ofnur reported reserves one our
ﬁnancial condition

there are nirmeroirs uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities ofproved oil and gas reserves and eash flovvs attributable to such reserves,
including factors beyond our engineers' eontrol torthe third party preparing the reserve report). Reserve engineering is a subgiective process ofestimating
underground accumulations ofoil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accirraey ofan estimate ofquantities ofreserves, or ofcash flows
attributable to such reserves, is a function ofthe available data, assumptions regarding future oil and gas prices, expenditures forfuture development and
exploration aetivities, engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. In addition, aeeurately estimating reserves in shale formations such as ours
can be even more difficult than estimating reserves in more traditional hydroearbori bearing formations given the complexities ofthe pmjcctcd deeline
curves and economics ofshale gas wells. Additionally, “probable” and "pmslblc" reserve estimates are estimates ofunproved reserves and may be
misunderstood or seen as misleading to investorsthat are not experts in the oil or natural gas industry.

As such, investors should not place undue reliance on these estimates, Reserves and future cash flows may be subjeet to material downward or
upvvard revisions. based upon production history.developmerit and exploration activities and prices ofoil and gas, In addition, different reserve engineers
may make different estimates ofreserves and cash flows based on the same available data. Because ofoursntallervolume ofrcserves eompared to oirr
competitors. revisions in reserve estimate and future cash flows have a greater chance ofbeing material to us,

the present value offuture net revenues from oirr proved reserves referred to in any reserve report will not neeessarily be the actual current market
vahre ofourestimated oil and gas reserves at such time. in aecordance vvith SLC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net eash flows from
its proved reserves using the un-vveighted arithmetic average ofthe first day ofthe month foreaeh month within a tvvelve month period.

We may lie unahie to acquire or develop aaaitinnai reserves. which would reduce our revenues and access to capital,

Producing oil and gas reservoirs generally are eharacterized by declining produetion rates that vary depending upon reservoircharacteristics and
other factors. Decline rates are typically greatest early in the productive life ofa well. bstimates ofthe decline rate ofan oil orgaswells, and those in shale
formations, in partieular, are inherently imprecise, and are less precise vvith respect to new oremerging oil and gas formations with limited production
histories than for more developed for-inationswith established production histories. Pmducllon on our properties and the reserves that may be recovered from
wells on ourproperties will ehange ifproduction from existing wells on ourpropertiesdeclines in a different mannerthan vve orourjoint venture parties have
estimated, lhus, ourfuture oil and gas reserves and produetion and, therefore. our future cash flovv and results ofoperations, are highly dependent upon the
suecess in efrieiently developing and exploiting oureunent properties and economically finding oracquiring additional teeoverable reserves, We may not
be able to find oracquire additional reserves or future production at acceptable eosts. lfwe are unable to replace our current orfuture production, ourcash

lfextraction proeedures, including hydraulic fraeturing. become increasingly regulated at the federal level as a result ofadditional federal
legislation orregulatory initiatives by the LPA, ouroperations could become subjeet to additional permttting and operational requirements and also to
attendant per-initting delays and potential inereases in costs. lfsuch permttting requirements delaysdrilling aetivity on ourproperties, ourability to present
reserves. and once presented, book reserves. will be delayed as well,

in addition. some states have adopted, and otherstates are eonsidering adopting, regulations that eould impose more stringent permitting, disclosure
and well constmction requirements on hydraulic fraeturing operations as well as possible restrietions on certain air pollutants. sueh as methane. Fol example,
pennsylvania. Colorado. and Wyoming have eaeh adopted a variety ofrvell eonstriiction. set back. and diselosure regulations limiting how fracturing ean be
performed and requiring various degrees ofehemical disclosure. Colorado recently proposed new airquality standards for methane emissions from oil and
gas exploration operations, Texas reeently passed a larv requiring public disclosure ofcertain information about chemieals used in the hydraulie fracturing
process, and the Rallmad Commission nf'l'cxas has adopted rules setting forth requirements forsuch publie diselosure. in addition. the Texas Commission
on Environmental Quality recently adopted more stringent aircinission and permitting requirements foroil and gas exploration operations in the Bamctl
Shale, More stringent airemissions and permitting requirements, as well as wastcmtcldlschargc limitations. may be imposed on the areas in which we
operate sometime in the future. These regulations, ifadopted. would affect our operations. inerease oiir eosts ofexploration and prodiietion and limit the
quantity ofoil and gas that we nrourjoint ventures can economically produee. Amajnrrisk inherent in drilling plans forourproperties is the need to obtain
drilling permits from state and local authorities on a timely basis following leasing. in addition to the imposition ofmore stringent regulations at the state
and federal level. certain loeal authorities have passed orare considering moratoria on oil and gas drilling and restrietions on hydraulic fraeturing. Delays in
obtaining regulatory approvals. drilling permits. the failure to obtain a drilling permit for a well orthe receipt ofa permit with unreasonable eonditions or
eosts could have a material adverse effch on ourability to explore ordevelop its properties. Additionally.the oil and gas regulatory environment eould
ehange in ways that might substantially inerease our ﬁnaneial and managerial eosts to eomply with the requirements ofthese laws and regulations and.
eonsequently. materially adversely affect ourproﬁtability, Funhcmmrc. these additional eosts may put us at a competitive disadvantage eompared to larger

The marketability ofnirnpredirertnn is dependent lqmn gathering, transportation. and prneersing/aetlirtes over which we may have little M Ma control.

lhe marketing ofoil and gas prodiietion depends in large part on the availability, proximity and capacity ofpipelines and storage facilities, gas
gathering systems and othertranspottation. proeessing and reﬁning faeilities, as well as the existenee ofadequate markets. lfthere were insuffieient eapacity
available on these systems. or ifthese systems were unavailable to us. the price effcrcd for our produetion eould be signifieantly depressed, or we eould be
foreed to shan some production ordelay ordiseontinue drilling plans and eommercial produetion following a diseovery ofhydrocarbons rvhile we
eonstrtiet ourown faeility. We also rely (and expect to rely in the future) on facilities developed and owned by third parties in orderto store. process. transmit
and sell our oil and gas produetion. oiirplans to develop ouroil and gas reserves eould be materially and adversely affeeted by the inability or
unwillingness ofthird parties to provide suffieient transmission, storage or processing ﬁcilltics to us. especially in areas ofplanned expansion rvhere such
faeilities do not eur-rently exist,

lfthe amount ofoil. gas orcondensate being produeed by us and others exceeds the capaeity ofthe various transportation pipelines and gathering
systems currently available in our operating areas, it will be necessary fornewtransportation pipelines and gathering systemsto be built. Or, in the ease ofoil
and condensate, it will be neeessary forusto rely more heavily on (nicks to transport our production. which is more expensive and less effieient than
transportation by pipeline. The constmction ofnew pipelines and gathering systems is capital intensive and construction may be postponed, interrupted or
eaneelled in response to changing economic conditions and the availability and eost ofcapital. in addition. capital eonstraints eould limit ourability to
build gathering systemsto transport ourprodiietion to transportation pipelines. in such event, eosts to transport our production may inerease materially orrve

Addillnnally. we do not orvn all ofthe land on which gathering and treating systems forourprodiietion have been constnieted. and we are therefore
siibtect to the possibility ofincreased costs to retain necessary land use.

ZaZa obtains the rightsto constmct and operate ourgathering and treating systems on land owned by third parties and govemmental ageneies fora

ITEM 7 — MANAGEMENT‘S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

ZaZa Energy Corporation is an independent oil and gas eompany foeused on the exploration and produetion ofuneonventional and eonventional
oil and gas assets. We eur-rently operate primarily throughtoint ventures in the Eagle Ford East trend in East Texas and the Eagle Eord trend in South Texas.
Ourcemmon stoek is traded on the NASDAQ Capilal Market underthe trading symbol ZAZA.

nurstrategy isto enhanee shareholdervalue through eonsistent growth in eash flows by foeusing on the organie development ofour existing assets
within oiireore areas. We also look for opponunities to diversify and build upon our eur-rent portfolio through the aequisition ofadditional uneonventional
and eonventional assets with a foeus on lexas.

Sinee the third quancronﬂM. our liquidity has been an area ofeoneem. The drop in oil priees that began at the end of2014 and eontinues today
has ereated further liquidity ehallenges as ourrevenues are direetly linked to the priee ofoil. As fiinherdiseussed below under the heading “Liquidin and
Capital Resources." oiirprospeetus for adequate liquidity in 2015 are uneertain. espeeially in light ofthe faet that beginning on Mareh 23. 2015. any holder
ofthe $13.9 million in aggregate prineipal amount ofour Senior Seeured Notes may eleet to require iisto repurehase that holder‘s Senior Seeured Notes
within all days ofmalting sueh an eleetion. Although we are diseussing with the holders ofthe Senior Seeured Notes a 30—day extension (until April 22.
2015) ofthe earliest date that the holderofany ofthe Senior Seeured Notes ean exereise this right ofrepurehase. there is no assuranee that we will be
sueeessful in being given sueh an extension. Even without eonsidering the repurehase ofany ofthe Senior Seeured Notes. the Company will need to aeeess
additional eapital to eontinue as a going eoneem through May of20ls. Our board ofdireetors and management are aetively exploring ﬁnaneing and
partnership altematives while seeking to restrueture ourdebt. We ean offerno assuranee that a solution will be found.

ZaZa owns produeing and non-produeing oil and gas aereage in proven or prospeetive basins that are loeated in South Texas and East Texas.
Almost all ofour assets are loeated within the United States. Exeept foran immaterial amount ofeash held by ourforeign subsidiaries, whieh we are in the
proeess ofdissolving. we have no assets or operations outside ofthe United Slalcs. ln this Annual Report, ouruse of“ljasl ’l'cxns" refers to Houston. l_eon.
Madison. Grimes. Walker. Trinity and Montgomery eounties and the surrounding region. and ouruse of~~South Texas" refersto Dewitt and l_avaea eounties
and the surrounding region.

Additionally. we have eonverted ournatuial gas reserves orproduetion into barrel ofoil equivalents in this Annual Repon. Fonhls purpose. six
thousand eubie feet ofnatural gas is equal to one barrel ofoil. whieh is based on the relative energy eontent ofnatural gas and oil.

Recent Developments
Lllsl Texas Jami Velllllm wllh EOG

0n Mareh 7. 2014. we entered into the Eourth Amendment (Ihc ~~Eourth Axncndmcnt“)ln ourloint Exploration and Development Agreement with
LOG with respeet to the joint development ofeertain ofour East lexas propenies. Underthe I-ourlh Amendment, we agreed to assign to BOG approximately
9,5no net aeres in East Texas representing a 75% working interest in the aereage remaining in the third and final phase oflhcjolm development program
underthe lEDA. As eonsideration forthistransfer. we reeeived approximately $4.7 million in eash and the carry by our eounterpany ofourshare offuture
drilling and eompletion eosts in an aggregate amount up to approximately $9.2 mlllinn. As ofDeeembersl, 2014, the $9.2 million ofeartied eosts had been
fully deployed.

Also pursuant to the Feunh Amendment and efleetive Mareh 7, 2014, we and LOG agreed to terminate that eertain Participation Agreement,
efleetive as ofMareh l.2nlz, by and between the Company and Range Tcan Rroduetion, LLC (“Rangc"| (sueh agreement. as amended. the “Range

Qultclaim Assignment and Bill ofSale. effeetive as ofneeember l. 2013. by and between Range and oureounterpany.

ln Deeember20l4. BOG satisfied the last ofits drilling obligations underthe lEuA. While seleeted JEDA provisions survive. thejoint venture is
now prineipally governed by the Joint Operating Agreement among Eon, ZnZa. and Quantum. pursuant to its terms. ZaZa now has the right to propose new
development wells and maintain its desired minimum drilling paee.

Committee considers outside factors as well. such as indllslry shortages ofquallﬁed employees forsucll positions. recent experience in the marketplace. and
the elapsed time belween the sirrveys used and when compensation decisions are made. 1n light oflllese qualitative and other considerations. the base salary
ofa panicularotrieer may be greaterthan orless than the market SDIh percentile and total direct compensation may be greaterthan or less than the market
50th percentile and. in any event. the Compensation Committee recognizes that the compensation ofcertain ofoureitecutive otricers continuesto build to
these targeted levels. The Compensallon Committee revieus olIrexeeullve compensation program on an annua1basis.

Benchmarking and Peer Group

Priorto approving compensation forlhe NEOs in 2014. members ofollrmanagement team met wrth ourCompensation Committee and selected a
group ofcompanleslhat they consider a “peer group" rorexecutive and directorcompensation analysis purposes. This peer group was then used for purposes
ofdeveloping the reeommendationspresented to oirr Board ofDireeIors foremployment agreements wrth our NEOs and noncmployee uirector
compensation. The oil and gas companiesthat comprise this peer group were selected for, among otherreasons. because they potentially compete with ZaZa
for exeeullve level Ialenl.

lhe 2014 peer group for compensation purposes consists of:

Abraxas Petroleum Corp Magnum HunterResourees Corp,
Approach Resources, lnc. Matador Resources Company
Carrizo oil 31 Gas Inc, Penn Virginia Corporation
Comstock Resources. lnc. Retroouest Energy. Inc,

Crimson Exploration, lnc. Quicksilver Resources lnc.
l-oresl oil Corporation Rosetta Resources. lnc.

Goodrich Pelroleum Corporation Sanchez Energy Corp.

Halco'n Resources Corp. Swlﬁ Energy Co,

Management and the Compensallon Committee have compiled compensation data forthe peergroup from a variety ofsources, This compensation
data was then used to compare the compensation orour NEOs to the market. generally targeting base salaries forour NEOs at the market 7SIh percentile of
ourpeer group, and targeting annual cash and long-term incentives so that our NEOs will have the opportunity to reallze in future years total compensation
up to the 75m percentile ofourpeergroup based on company performance, We continue to use thispeergroup for2015 but expect to update it fromllme to
time,

Rule ofthe Cnmpensation Consultant

lhe Compensation Committee's chancrgiants the committee the sole authority to retain. at ourexpensc. outside, independent consultants orcxperts
to assist il in ils duties. In 2014. the Compensation Committee did not receive advice from a compensation consultant wilh respect to compensation in 2014.
However. in August 2013, as pan orcostcutting measures. management engaged BDO USA LLP (“BDO")Io advise it wrth respect to possible methods of
reducing the cash ponion oreitecutive compensation by increasing the equity component orexecutive compensation. As a result ofthis revieu. whleh
continued into 2014. the Compensallon Committee entered into an amendment to the employment agreement of‘l‘odd A, Brooks, oirr ChierExecutive
Ofﬁcer and Presldenl (the "Brooks Amendmenl"). As a resull ofthe Brooks Amendrnenl.ll1e annual salary oer. Brooks was reduced to $1 and the short»

NOTE 2 — GOING CONCERN

Our independent registered publie aeeounting ﬁrm forthe year ended ueeember3 1. 2014 issued theirrepori dated Mareh 31, znl 5, that ineluded an
explanatory paragmph describing the existenee ofcnndilions that mise substantial doubt about ourability to eontinue as a going eoneem due to our
dependeney on the sueeess ofcxccuting stiategie altematives oraeeessto eapital markets to fund oiireommitments and to genemte sumeient eash ﬂows to
maintain positive liquidity,

Beginning on Mareh 23, 2015. the holders oflhc Senior Seeured Notes are able to require us to purehase all ora ponion nfthc 10% Senior Seeured
Notes due znl 7 at a priee equal to the tlss million in prineipal amount orthe Senior Seeured Notes to be purehased. plus any aeemed and unpaid interest
on sueh notes (the “ScniorScCurcd Notes Put Option"), lflhc holders ofthe SeniorSeeured Notes exereise the SeniorSeeured Notes Put Option, we will not
be able to fund oureommitments without aeeess to additional liquidity and we will be in default underthe SeniorSeeured Notes, lrany oflhc holdeis nfthc
Senior Seeured Notes were to exereise their rights underthe SeniorSeeured Notes Put Option. we would have 30 days to purehase those Senior Seeured Notes.
lfthis derault oeeuis, we will be unable to eontinue as a going eoneern.

Even without the exereise orthe Senior Seeured Put Option. we do not eurrently geneiate sut=rieient eash ﬂows to maintain positive liquidity to fund
opemting and debt serviee requirements throughout the next year, As omeeemberst, 2014, we had $6.3 million in eash and eash equivalents and working
eapital derieit omm million, Overth next year. we antieipate monthly eash general and administrative expenses and eash interest payments to average
1.1.: million per month and eapital expenditures of30.5 million permonth (2015 antieipated amounts are unaudilcdl. without additional eash funding, and
eonsidering our eurrent loreeasts loreash generated by opeiations, we antieipate exhausting oureash and eash equivalents in May 2015,

lhese matters raise substantial doubt about the Company‘s ability to eontinue as a going eoneern. The Company’s Board omireetois and
management team continue to take steps to try to strengthen the Company’s balanee sheet. We intend to exeelite strategie alternatives and access the capital
markets to fund oureash needs, Any deeision regarding a stiategie altemative or rinaneing transaction. and ourability to eomplete sueh a transaetion. will
depend on prevailing market eonditions and otherfaetors, No assumnees ean be given that sueh transaetions ean be eonsummated on tenns that are
aeeeptable to the Company, orat all.

NOTE 3 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Use umsrimates

lhe preparation ofﬁnanclal statements in conformily with United States geneially aeeepted aeeounting prineiples requires us to malte estimates and
assumptions that aileet the amounts reported in the eonsolidated rinaneial statements and aeeompanying notes, Aetual results eould dlffcl tromthose

lhe Company maintains its eash balanees at seveml ﬁnancial institutions. whieh are insured by the Fchm] Deposit lnsuianee Corpomtion. lhe
Company‘s eash balanees typieally are in excess oflhc insured limit. lhis eoneentration may impaet the Company's overall eredit risk. either positively or
negatively. in that this entity may be similarly atteeted by ehanges in eeonomie orothereonditions. The Company has ineurred no losses related to these
accounts.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts reeeivable inelude oil and gas revenues andjoint interest billings. Management penodieally assesses the Company‘s aeeounts reeeivable
and establishes an allowanee forcslllnatcd uneolleetible amounts, Aeeounts detennined to be uneolleetible are eharged to opemtionswhen that
determination is made. The Company usually does not require collalcml.

Revenue Reeognition

lhe Company derives its oil and gas revenue primarily from the sale ofproduccd oil and gas. The Company usesthe sales method ofaccounting for
the recognition efgas revenue whereby revenues. net ofmyallics are reeognized as the produetion is sold to the purehaser, The amount ofgas sold may ditter

oeeurvvhen produetion delivered into the pipeline varies fromthe gas we nominated for sale. Pipeline imbalanees. whieh have historieally been and etmently
eontinue to be immaterial. are settled with eash approximately all days from date ofprodtretion and are reeorded as a reduetion ofrevenue orinerease of
revenue depending upon whether vve are over—delivered or under—delivered, Settlements ofoil and gas sales Occurnﬁcrthc month in whieh the produet vvas

refleeted in the aeeounting period during whieh payments are reeeived from the purehaser.

Successful Eﬂ‘ons Method ofAeeaunting for Oil and Gas Activities

ihe Company aeeounts for its oil and gas exploration and produetion aetivities underthe sueeessful efforts method ofaeeotrnting, Oil and gas lease
aequisition eosts are eapitalized when ineurred. Lease rentals are expensed as ineur-red. Oil and gas exploration eosts, otherthan the eosts ofdrilling
exploratory wells, are eharged to expense as ineur-red, The eosts ofdrilling exploratory vvells are eapitalized pending determination ofwhetherthey have
diseovered proved reserves, Explomtory drilling eosts are eapitalized when drilling is eomplete ifit is deter-mined that there is eeonomie prodtreibility
supponed by eitheraetual produetion ora eonelusive formation test. ifproved reserves are not diseovered. streh drilling eosts are expensed. in some
eiretrmstanees. it may be uneertain whether proved reserves have been found when drilling has been eompleted. Such exploratory well drilling eosts may
eontinue to be eapitalized ifthe reserve quantity is suffreient to Justify its eompletion as a prodtreing well and sumeient progress in assessing the reserves and
the eeonomie and operating viability ofthe projeet is being made. Costs to develop proved reserves, ineltrding the eosts ofall development wells and related
equipment used in the produetion ofnattrral gas and erude oil. are eapitalized. Unproved properties with individually signifreant aequisition eosts are
analyzed on a pmpcnyrby-pmpcny basis forany impairment in value, lfthe unproved properties are determmed to be prodtretive, the appropriate related
eosts are transferred to proved oil and gasproperties.

ihe Company‘s third party engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves. whieh direetly impaet finaneial aeeounting estimates. ineluding
depreeiatiort. depletion, and amortization and impairment eonsiderations. Our proved reserves represent estimated quantities ofoil and eondensate, natural
gas liqtrids and gas that geologieal and engineering data demonstrate. with reasonable eertainty. to be reeovered in future years from known reservoirs under
eeonomie and operating eonditions existing at the time the estimates vvere made. The proeess ofestimating quantities ofproved oil and gas reserves is very
eomplex requiring signifreant subjective deeisions in the evaluation ofall available geologieal, engineering. and eeonomie data foreaeh reservoir. The data
fora given reservoirmay also ehange substantially overtime as a result ofntrmerous faetors ineluding. btrt not limited to. additional development aetivity.
evolving produeing history. and eontmual reassessment ofthe viability ofproduetion undervarying eeonomie eonditions. Consequently. material revisions
(upward Ordownwaldl to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time,

Depreeiatiort. depletion, and amortization ofthe eost ofproved oil and gas properties are ealeulated using the unitof.produetion method. The
reserve base used to ealeulate depreeiatiori. depletion. and amortization for leasehold aequisition eosts is the sum ofproved developed reserves and proved
undeveloped reserves. with respeet to lease and well equipment eosts. vvhieh inelude development eosts and streeessful exploration drilling eosts. the reserve
base ineltrdes only proved developed reserves. bstimated future dismantlement. restoration. and abandonment eosts. net ofsalvage values are Iakcn into
account,

Unit-ofproduetion rates are revised vvheneverthere is an indieation ofa need, btrt at least annually. when eireumstanees mdieate that an asset may
be impaired. the Company eompares expeeted undiseounted future eash flovvs at a produeing field level to the net book value ofthe asset. lfthe future
undiseounted eash flows. based on the Company‘s estimate offuttrre natural gas and erude oil priees. operating eosts. antieipated produetion from proved
reserves. and other relevant data, are lovverthan the net book value. the eapitalized eost is redrreed to fairvalue. Fairvaluc is ealeulated by diseountmg the

Dear Ml. Jansen.

AI your request, Ryder Seott Company, 1.1:, (Ryder Scolll has prepared an esttmate ofthe proved reserves. future produetion. and ineome
allributablc to eertain leasehold interests nflaZn Energy Corporation (Zala) as ofueeember31,2014, The suhjeet properties are located in the state of
Texas. The reserves and ineome data were estimated based on the definitions and dtselosure gutdelines ofthe Unilcd states Seeunties and Exchange
Commission (SLC)conIzuncd tn Title 17, Code ancdcml Regulattons.lv1odemtzation of0i1 and Gas Reporting. Final Rule released January 14. 2009, tn the
Fedch Register tsuc regulattonst, Ourlhlrd party study. eompleted on January 19, 2015, and presented herein. was prepared in aeeordanee with the
dtselosure requtrements set forth in the suc regulations,

lhe properties evaluated by Ryder Seott represent 100 pereent ofthe total net proved liqutd hydrocarbon reserves and 100 pereent ofthe total net
proved gas reserves annZa as ofDeeemher31.2014.

lhe estimated reserves and future net tneome amounts presented tn thts report, as ofDeeemoer 2 1. 2014. are related to hydroearbon pnees, The
hydrocaﬂmn prtees used tn the preparation ofthis report are based on the average prtees during the 12—month penod prtorto the “as nfdalc" ofthis report,
determined as the unweighted arithmette averages ofthe priees tn effeet on the ﬁr<t—day-of-thc-menlh for eaeh month within sueh period. unless priees were
defined by eonttaetual arrangements, as required by the suc regulattons, Acllml future priees may vary signtfteantly fromthe priees requtred by SEC
regulattons. therefore, volumes ofreserves aetually reeovered and the amounts ofmeome aetually reeetved may dtffersignifteantly from the estimated
quantities presented in this report, The results ofthts study are summarized below.

Reserves minded in This Repurt

lhe proved reserves ineluded herein eonrormto the deﬁnition as set fonh in the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulallom Part 210,4-
lota), An abridged version orthe suc reserves definitions from 2 10.44013) entitled “Petroleum Reserves Deﬁnitions" is included as an attaehment to this
reporl.

lhe various proved reserve status categories are deﬁned underthe attaehment entitled “Pclrolcum Reserves Slalus Dcﬁnilmns and Guldclincs“ in
this report, Reserves in this report are eategorized as proved producing. proved non-producing, and proved undeveloped. The proved developed non»
produeing reserves. vvhieh eonsist nfthc proved shut—in eategory, inolude wells that had been drilled and eompleted but had not eommenoed produetion by
the “as or' date nflhis report. Proved undeveloped reserves have been assigned in the east Texas area.

No attempt was made to quanufy orothenvise aeeount fnrzmy aeoumulated gas produenon imbalaneesthat may cxlsl. lhe proved gas volumes
presented herein do not inelude volumes ofgas eonsumed in operations as reserves,

Reserves are ~~estiinated remaining quantities oroil and gas and related snbstanees antieipated to be eoonomioally produoible, as ofa given date, by
applieation ordevelopment projeets [0 knotvn accumulations,“ All reserve estimates involve an assessment nflhc uneertainty relating the likelihood that the
aetual remaining quantities reeovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as nfthc date the estimate is made. The uneertainty
depends chieﬂy on the amount nfrcllablc geologie and engineering data available at the time nflhc estimate and the interpretation orthese data. The
relative degree efunccrtainly may be eonveyed by plaeing reserves into one oflwn prineipal elassirieations. eitherproved ornnproved. Unproved reserves
are less eertain to be reeovered than proved reserves, and may be furtth snb-olassiried as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively inereasing
uneertainty in their reeoverability. AI ZaZa's request. this report addresses only the proved reserves attributable to the properties evaluated herein.

Proved oil and gas reserves are “Ihesc quantities nfoil and gas tvhieh, by analysis efgcnscicncc and engineering data. ean be estimated with
reasonable eertainty to be eeonomieally produeible fmm a given date forward." The proved reserves included herein were estimated using deterininistie
methods, The SEC has deﬁned reasonable eertainty for proved reserves, when based on deterministie methods. as a “hlgh degree nfconﬁdcncc that the
quantities will be reeoveredb‘

Proved reserve estimates vvill generally be revised only as additional geologic orengineering data beeome available oras eeonomic eonditions
change. Folpmvcd reserves, the suc states that “as changes due to increased availability ofgeoseience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical).
engineering, and eeonomic data are made to the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with time. reasonably eertain EUR is much more llkcly to increase or
remain eonstant than to decrease." Moreover, estimates ofproved reserves may be revised as a result offuture operations, et=feets ofregulation by
governmental agencies orgeopolitical oreconomie risks, Therefore, the proved reserves ineluded in this report are estimates only and should not be
construed as being cxacl quantities, and ifrecovered. the revenues therefrom. and the actual costs related thereto, could be more or less than the estimated
ammlnls,

ZaZa's operations may be subjeet to various levels ofgovernmental eontrols and regulations, These controls and regulations may include, but may
not be limited to, matteis relating to land tenure and leasing, the legal rights to produce hydrocarbons, drilling and production praetices, environmental
proteetion, marketing and pricing policies, royalties, various taxes and levies including income tax and are subglcct to change from time to time. Such
changes in govemmental regulations and policies may cause volumes ofproved reserves actually reeovered and amounts ofproved income actually reeeived
to differ signiﬁeantly from the estimated quantities,

lhe estimates ofproved reserves presented herein tvere based upon a detailed study ofthe properties in which LaZn owns an interest, however, we
have not made any field cxzuninallon ofthe properties. No consideration was given in this report to potential environmental liabilities that may exist nor

lhe estimation ofreserves involves ttvo distinct detei-rriinations, lhe first detenuination results in the estimation ofthe quantities ofreeoveiable oil
and gas and the second detenuination results in the estimation ofthe uncertainty associated tvith those estimated quantities in accordance with the
definitions set forth by the Seeurities and Exchange Commission's Regulations Pan 210.4.lota). The process ofestimating the quantities ofrecoverable oil
and gas reserves relies on the use ofeertain geneially aeeepted analytical procedures. These analytical procedures ﬁll into three broad categories ormethods.
tl)performance.based methods; t2)volumetrie-based methods; and manalogy, These methods may be used singly orin combination by the reserve
evaluatorin the proeess orestimating the quantities ofreserves. Reserve evaluators must select the method orcombination ofmethods which in their
professionalgtudgment is most appropriate. given the nature and amount ofreliable geoscience and engineering data available at the time orthe estimate, the
established oranticipated perforinanee charaeteristies ofthe reservoir being evaluated, and the stage ofdevelopment or producing maturity ofthe property.

in many cases.the analysis ofthe available geoscience and engineering data and the subsequent interpretation ofthis data may indieate a range of
possible outcomes in an estimate, inespective orthe method selected by the evaluator. when a range in the quantity ofreserves is identified, the evaluator
must determtne the uncertainty assoeiated vvith the ineremental quantities ofthe reserves, lfthe reserve quantities are estimated using the deterministie
incremental approach. the uncertainty for eaeh discrete ineremental quantity ofthe reserves is addressed by the reserve category assigned by the evaluator.
Therefore, it is the categorization ofreserve quantities as proved. probable and,or possible that addresses the inherent uncertainty in the estimated quantities
reponed. For proved reserves, uncertainty is deﬁned by the suc as reasonable cenainty wherein the "quantities actually recovered are much more likely than
not to be achieved,“ The SEC states that “probable
