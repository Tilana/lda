<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Background 
</b></p>
<p>1. The United Nations Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, established by the Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 1987/83, 
</p>
<p>receives voluntary contributions from Governments, organizations and individuals. The 
</p>
<p>objective of the Fund is to provide financial support for international cooperation aimed at 
</p>
<p>building up and strengthening national and regional institutions and infrastructures that will 
</p>
<p>have long-term impact on improved implementation of international human rights 
</p>
<p>standards. 
</p>
<p>2. The Board of Trustees has been operational since 1993 and its members are 
</p>
<p>appointed by the Secretary-General for a three-year renewable term. The mandate of the 
</p>
<p>Board is to assist the Secretary-General in streamlining and rationalizing the working 
</p>
<p>methods and procedures of the technical cooperation programme. It meets twice a year and 
</p>
<p>reports on its work to the Secretary-General and the Human Rights Council. Current 
</p>
<p>members are Mariclaire Acosta Urquidi (Mexico), Christopher Sidoti (Australia), Lin Lim 
</p>
<p>(Malaysia), Valeriu Nicolae (Romania) and Esi Sutherland-Addy (Ghana). Mr. Nicolae and 
</p>
<p>Ms. Sutherland-Addy were appointed to the Board in January 2015, replacing Sozar Subari 
</p>
<p>(Georgia) and Fatimata Mbaye (Mauritania) respectively, who ended their terms on 31 
</p>
<p>December 2014. The Board elected Ms. Acosta as chairperson from 30 June 2014 until 30 
</p>
<p>June 2015, when she will be replaced by Lin Lim, who was elected chairperson by the 
</p>
<p>Board at its forty-first session, in Phnom Penh and in Bangkok. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Mandate 
</b></p>
<p>3. Throughout the period under review, the Board of Trustees continued to engage 
</p>
<p>actively with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</p>
<p>(OHCHR), including its field presences, providing advice on policy orientation and 
</p>
<p>strategic vision on technical cooperation components of all its programmes. This refocused 
</p>
<p>approach, which is framed within the broad definition of technical cooperation, was agreed 
</p>
<p>upon by the Board of Trustees and presented to Member States in the annual report of the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General submitted to the Human Rights Council in 2011.1 
</p>
<p>4. The members of the Board are also the constituent members of the Board of 
</p>
<p>Trustees for the Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance in the 
</p>
<p>Implementation of the Universal Periodic Review. In that capacity, they continued to 
</p>
<p>provide OHCHR with policy guidance in order to maximize the effectiveness of technical 
</p>
<p>assistance and financial support for States in implementing recommendations of the 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review and other international mechanisms at the State level (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/29/22). 
</p>
<p>5. The Board sessions, held both in Geneva and in countries where OHCHR has a 
</p>
<p>presence, have been particularly useful in increasing the understanding of the synergies and 
</p>
<p>the mutual reinforcing aspects of the support provided by OHCHR through the two funds. 
</p>
<p>These aspects, together with the discussion on the financial and administrative elements 
</p>
<p>governing the two funds, help the Board members to continue to refine the various aspects 
</p>
<p>of their dual and separate mandates in order to achieve their aims more effectively and to 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 A/HRC/16/66. </p>


<p>strengthen further the complementarities between the two funds. For this reason, the Board 
</p>
<p>encourages OHCHR to continue to develop avenues for greater integration of aspects 
</p>
<p>relevant to the two funds.  
</p>
<p>6. The present report covers the fortieth and forty-first sessions of the Board in its 
</p>
<p>capacity relating to the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights. At those sessions, the Board continued to explore various components of the human 
</p>
<p>rights programme funded by the Fund within the framework of the OHCHR Organizational 
</p>
<p>Management Plan for 2014-2017 with a view to providing policy guidance and advice on 
</p>
<p>technical cooperation by OHCHR. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities and results of the Voluntary Fund and the Board of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Trustees 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Fortieth session 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Board of Trustees of the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field 
</p>
<p>of Human Rights held its fortieth session in Geneva, from 14 to 16 October 2014. The 
</p>
<p>session was chaired by Mariclaire Acosta, who had been elected Chairperson of the Board 
</p>
<p>of Trustees at its thirty-ninth session. All members of the Board attended the session.  
</p>
<p>8. The main objectives of the session were to take stock of the financial and 
</p>
<p>administrative situation of the fund and the plans ahead for 2015; to provide comments on 
</p>
<p>the draft OHCHR practical guide on civil society space and the United Nations human 
</p>
<p>rights system; to share views on current human rights challenges and issues, such as Ebola, 
</p>
<p>and/or humanitarian situations, including conflict and insecurity, and their implications for 
</p>
<p>meeting OHCHR targets; to acquire a better understanding of the work of Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Components of United Nations peace missions in the area of technical cooperation; and to 
</p>
<p>follow up on previous visits, with particular focus on the Middle East and North Africa 
</p>
<p>region. The Board also took the opportunity during the session in Geneva to continue to 
</p>
<p>provide expertise and advice on the thematic strategies of OHCHR and its technical 
</p>
<p>cooperation components, in particular on early warning and the protection of human rights 
</p>
<p>in situations of conflict and insecurity, on widening the democratic space and on human 
</p>
<p>rights in development and in the economic sphere. The use of human rights indicators, their 
</p>
<p>adaptation to national situations and their practical application in measuring the impact on 
</p>
<p>the ground, and the tools available in the area of business and human rights, were issues 
</p>
<p>paid specific attention by the Board given the interest generated during its recent visits. The 
</p>
<p>Board also received an update on developments in the post-2015 development agenda. 
</p>
<p>9. The High Commissioner briefed the Board on the financial status of OHCHR and 
</p>
<p>the level of voluntary contributions, including for the Voluntary Fund for Technical 
</p>
<p>Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights, which unfortunately is not growing at the same 
</p>
<p>pace as the requests for support and expectations from States. The Board is gravely 
</p>
<p>concerned at the financial situation of OHCHR, and expressed its total support for the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner and his call for increased resources from both the regular budget of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations and voluntary contributions, particularly at such a critical time, when the 
</p>
<p>operational capacities of the Office should be further strengthened rather than increasingly 
</p>
<p>stretched. In the light of the situation and as a way of symbolic contribution, the Board 
</p>
<p>decided to hold one session only in 2015 (field session) and to postpone to 2016 its second 
</p>
<p>session (the session at headquarters), which would be held in conjunction with the field 
</p>
<p>session. The Board, with the support of the secretariat, is using modern technologies to 
</p>
<p>provide a constant update on the management and use of the Fund.  </p>


<p>10. The Board was pleased by the quality of information and availability of the 
</p>
<p>secretariat to provide specific reports with relevant information on the use of the Fund 
</p>
<p>facilitated by latest upgrades and full use of the performance monitoring system across 
</p>
<p>OHCHR. The presentation by the secretariat of the specific programmes financed by the 
</p>
<p>Fund by region and relevant to the various thematic strategies were complemented by 
</p>
<p>briefings and discussions with staff from the Policy, Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation 
</p>
<p>Service, Programme Support Management Services and the Donor and External Relations 
</p>
<p>Section, who provided additional updates on the status of all financial and operational 
</p>
<p>aspects of the Fund. The Board discussed with the relevant services of the Office the low 
</p>
<p>level of contributions to the Fund compared with its increasing requirements, which in 2014 
</p>
<p>obliged the High Commissioner to allocate $8 million to the Fund from unearmarked 
</p>
<p>contributions to OHCHR in order to close the existing funding gap under the Fund.  
</p>
<p>11. The Board was invited to provide inputs for the publication <i>Civil Society Space and 
</i></p>
<p><i>the United Nations Human Rights System: A Practical Guide for Civil Society</i> produced by 
</p>
<p>the Civil Society Section of OHCHR. The aim of the guide is to highlight issues relating to 
</p>
<p>the work of civil society actors, with an overview of the conditions and environment needed 
</p>
<p>for a free and independent civil society, including relevant international human rights 
</p>
<p>standards for freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly and the right to 
</p>
<p>participate in public affairs. The guide includes examples of how Governments and civil 
</p>
<p>society actors have worked together to develop space for civil society to carry out its work 
</p>
<p>to advance the enjoyment of all human rights (civil, cultural, economic, political and social) 
</p>
<p>for all. Some of the examples included in the guide were made possible by the support 
</p>
<p>provided by the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation to local partners. One example 
</p>
<p>was the development of the 2012 Law for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders and 
</p>
<p>Journalists in Mexico. During its visit to Tunisia in 2013, the Board had the opportunity to 
</p>
<p>discuss with local partners the participation of civil society bodies in a number of initiatives 
</p>
<p>during the democratic transition, including in the preparation of laws on accession to a 
</p>
<p>number of international human rights treaties. The strengthening of the capacities of civil 
</p>
<p>society actors to engage with international human rights mechanisms should be 
</p>
<p>accompanied by instruments to respond adequately to the rise in demand. This is 
</p>
<p>particularly important in the context of the regrettably increasing number of cases of 
</p>
<p>reported reprisals against civil society actors in many parts of the world.  
</p>
<p>12. The Board was briefed by the Rapid Response and Peace Missions Support Section 
</p>
<p>and staff on the support provided through the human rights components in United Nations 
</p>
<p>peace missions. Given the complexity of such situations, the support from components is 
</p>
<p>notable. The experiences shared from the work in Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of 
</p>
<p>the Congo and Haiti should be used to continue to raise the profile of components during 
</p>
<p>negotiations on establishing mission mandates. The Board notes the usual practice of not 
</p>
<p>allocating funds missions of this type to technical cooperation programmes focused on 
</p>
<p>human rights components owing to competing priorities. This is an issue that the Board 
</p>
<p>believes should be revisited and carefully analysed The Board is interested in improving its 
</p>
<p>knowledge of the technical cooperation programmes of these components and is exploring 
</p>
<p>possibilities to visit a peacekeeping mission in the near future. 
</p>
<p>13. The Board held discussions with relevant staff members from the Middle East and 
</p>
<p>North Africa Section and the heads of OHCHR field presences in the region by means of 
</p>
<p>teleconferences on relevant developments in the region since its earlier visits to several 
</p>
<p>OHCHR presences. The work of the Office in the region clearly illustrates the importance 
</p>
<p>of drawing on all the capacities of the Office so that technical cooperation and advisory 
</p>
<p>services are based firmly on a comprehensive and coherent understanding of the particular 
</p>
<p>conditions on the ground, a result of systematic monitoring and analysis. The opportunity 
</p>
<p>for measurable success in the implementation of technical cooperation programmes is 
</p>
<p>greater when a comprehensive strategy integrating all relevant components of the work of </p>


<p>the Office is in place. The medium&#8211; and long-term engagement needed to see the results of 
</p>
<p>capacity-building efforts is another critical aspect. In this regard, the experiences of the 
</p>
<p>offices in Tunisia and Palestine serve as an inspiration for similar programmes in other 
</p>
<p>parts of the region and in other regions.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Forty-first session 
</b></p>
<p>14. Pursuant to the Board&#8217;s practice of holding one of its two meetings each year in a 
</p>
<p>State where OHCHR has a field presence, the forty-first session was held in Phnom Penh 
</p>
<p>from 9 to 11 February 2015 and in Bangkok from 12 to 13 February 2015. This was the 
</p>
<p>fourth time that a session of the Board was organized outside Geneva.  
</p>
<p>15. The visit to the OHCHR country office in Cambodia, the oldest OHCHR field 
</p>
<p>presence established in 1993 tracing its origins back to the United Nations Transitional 
</p>
<p>Authority in Cambodia, represented an excellent opportunity for the Board to observe in 
</p>
<p>situ how the various components of the work of the Office, including its technical 
</p>
<p>cooperation programmes, work together to better serve and support national efforts to 
</p>
<p>ensure the enjoyment of human rights by all. The main purpose of the visits, as in the case 
</p>
<p>of previous sessions and visits to the field, was to continue to gather in situ observations of 
</p>
<p>the added value of OHCHR technical cooperation efforts and areas that required 
</p>
<p>strengthening in the design and implementation of OHCHR programmes. The Board also 
</p>
<p>had the opportunity to explore how the design and implementation of such programmes 
</p>
<p>were intimately linked with all components of the various areas of work of the Office and 
</p>
<p>how the Office works with the rest of the United Nations family to promote human rights.  
</p>
<p>16. The visit to the OHCHR Regional Office for South East Asia in Bangkok was an 
</p>
<p>opportunity for Board members to better understand the type of support being provided 
</p>
<p>from a regional setting. The Board noted that the Office had gone through important 
</p>
<p>transformations for the three previous years, which have strengthened the capacity of 
</p>
<p>OHCHR to respond to, and to provide support in, complex situations. The Board was 
</p>
<p>pleased to be able to observe an OHCHR regional office in action, and welcomed the 
</p>
<p>efforts made to strengthen the regional office further. The visit confirmed its view of the 
</p>
<p>importance for OHCHR of continuing to seek to establish regional offices in all regions to 
</p>
<p>ensure global coverage and the global implementation of the full mandate of the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 48/141. While in 
</p>
<p>Bangkok, the Board also held discussions with the human rights advisers deployed to 
</p>
<p>United Nations country teams in the region. The Advisers had been deployed with support 
</p>
<p>of the Voluntary Fund to States such as Sri Lanka and Papua New Guinea, or are being 
</p>
<p>deployed under the United Nations Development Group &#8211; Human Rights Working Group 
</p>
<p>framework to States including Timor-Leste and the Philippines. 
</p>
<p>17.  In Cambodia, the Board discussed technical cooperation activities by the OHCHR 
</p>
<p>presence in the country with different national authorities, United Nations partners and civil 
</p>
<p>society organizations. This included visits to selected projects, such as the resettlement site 
</p>
<p>at Oudong, the Court in Kampong Speu and the Correctional Centre 1, where the Board 
</p>
<p>was briefed on the specific situation of human rights on the basis of the Office&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>observations and how specific technical cooperation programmes and advisory services 
</p>
<p>supported national institutions, in particular State authorities, including the Ministry of the 
</p>
<p>Interior and the Ministry of Justice, in addressing remaining challenges. 
</p>
<p>18. During the visit, the Board held discussions with representatives of the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior and other relevant State institutions on the 
</p>
<p>support provided in various thematic areas, including through technical cooperation and 
</p>
<p>advisory services, for example, on follow-up to recommendations made by human rights </p>


<p>mechanisms in the area of justice system reform, prison reform, implementation of the 
</p>
<p>Convention against Torture and the Optional Protocol thereto, land rights and the right to 
</p>
<p>housing. The situation of human rights defenders and the critical importance of keeping the 
</p>
<p>space open for civil society actors in order to continue to support the State&#8217;s efforts in the 
</p>
<p>area of human rights were also a main area of discussions with relevant stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>Particularly important for the Board was the good cooperation between the Office and the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of the Interior. The Office had been able to use its convening capacity to promote 
</p>
<p>dialogue and understanding on crucial current issues, including those related to access to 
</p>
<p>land and the exploitation of natural resources.  
</p>
<p>19. In its discussions with representatives of the Ministry of Justice, the Board was able 
</p>
<p>also to understand the progress made in strengthening the justice system in the country. One 
</p>
<p>of the issues discussed with both the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Justice was 
</p>
<p>that of prison overcrowding, something the Board had witnessed during its visit to 
</p>
<p>Correctional Centre 1. The Board was of the view that, in order to build on the 
</p>
<p>achievements made to date by the ongoing technical cooperation programmes in the area of 
</p>
<p>prison reform, the State could request further support from the Office, in particular on 
</p>
<p>issues requiring joint action by both ministries to respond effectively to the important 
</p>
<p>concerns regarding overcrowding and the large number of persons in pretrial detention. The 
</p>
<p>visit to the Kampong Speu Court, which was built and operated with the support of 
</p>
<p>OHCHR and the United Nations Development Programme, had given the Board the chance 
</p>
<p>to observe both progress made and the challenges remaining in the area of justice reform. 
</p>
<p>The Board had also observed the result of the technical cooperation efforts made in the 
</p>
<p>formulation and implementation of the new Code of Criminal Procedure, including the 
</p>
<p>participation of all judges and prosecutors in round-table and panel discussions across the 
</p>
<p>country in order to identify challenges and possible solutions. The Board had appreciated 
</p>
<p>the enormous efforts made to completely rebuild the court system in Cambodia, but 
</p>
<p>remained concerned that there was still a critical need for support in order to allow the 
</p>
<p>system to become fully operational. This was all the more urgent given that the Board was 
</p>
<p>informed by State officials that resources were becoming extremely limited.  
</p>
<p>20. The Board had held discussions with the Cambodia Human Rights Committee on 
</p>
<p>the technical support provided by OHCHR and other United Nations partners in a number 
</p>
<p>of legislative processes. Concerns with regard to both the current difficulties encountered 
</p>
<p>by civil society and the potential impact that proposed legislation might have on the space 
</p>
<p>for civil society organizations to operate were discussed. The Board very much hoped that 
</p>
<p>any initiative planned in this direction would fully take into account existing international 
</p>
<p>standards and good practices around the world. Maintaining this space was essential for 
</p>
<p>civil society to continue to carry out its crucial role in national development.  
</p>
<p>21. In both Phnom Penh and Bangkok, the Board held discussions with civil society 
</p>
<p>representatives, at both the country and regional levels, on the increasingly restricted 
</p>
<p>contexts in which they worked, the efforts of the Office to protect and increase civil society 
</p>
<p>space, and the technical support received from the Office to strengthen capacities to better 
</p>
<p>engage with human rights mechanisms. Other issues discussed included concerns relating 
</p>
<p>to human rights defenders, the promotion of freedom of expression and assembly, and 
</p>
<p>participation in national policy processes. The Board was also briefed about human rights 
</p>
<p>issues relating to land and the environment, migration and the fight against human 
</p>
<p>trafficking. 
</p>
<p>22. During meetings with the Board, representatives of the United Nations agencies and 
</p>
<p>programmes in Phnom Penh and Bangkok confirmed the critical guiding role that OHCHR 
</p>
<p>played in supporting the integration of recommendations made by international human 
</p>
<p>rights mechanisms, including the special procedures, treaty bodies and the universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review, into United Nations programme tools on the ground, including the United </p>


<p>Nations Development Assistance Frameworks. When the outcome of these mechanisms 
</p>
<p>were fully integrated into the early stages of programming, planning and assessment 
</p>
<p>processes, there were greater opportunities to develop sound programmes to support States&#8217; 
</p>
<p>efforts to address critical human rights issues and to develop solid partnerships with 
</p>
<p>relevant national institutions. In this context, discussions with human rights advisers 
</p>
<p>deployed in the region were particularly enlightening with regard to opportunities and areas 
</p>
<p>requiring improvement, in particular their capacity to provide technical cooperation and 
</p>
<p>advisory services in collaboration with other United Nations agencies.  
</p>
<p>23. The Board took the opportunity of its visit to Bangkok to discuss (via 
</p>
<p>teleconferencing) with the chairpersons of the national human rights commissions of 
</p>
<p>Malaysia and the Philippines the Office&#8217;s support for the establishment and strengthening 
</p>
<p>of national protection systems, of which national human rights institutions that comply with 
</p>
<p>the Paris Principles were a key pillar. The Board also discussed developments regarding the 
</p>
<p>Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights of the Association of Southeast Asian 
</p>
<p>Nations. The Board reiterated its view that technical cooperation in the field of human 
</p>
<p>rights should give high priority to the development and strengthening of national human 
</p>
<p>rights systems and institutions. It was pleased to learn that 6 of the 11 States in South-East 
</p>
<p>Asia had national human rights institutions, and that five of those six had &#8220;A&#8221; status. It 
</p>
<p>noted the strong support given to national human rights institutions by the regional office 
</p>
<p>and its close collaboration with them. It encouraged the regional office and other OHCHR 
</p>
<p>field presences in the region to continue this support and collaboration.  
</p>
<p>24.  The Board found that OHCHR priorities in Cambodia during the programming 
</p>
<p>cycle for the period 2014-2017were in line with the expectations of national stakeholders, 
</p>
<p>and that the Office continued to be seen, more than 20 years since its establishment, as a 
</p>
<p>reliable partner with the capacity to respond adequately to new challenges, for example, in 
</p>
<p>the area of access to land and housing. The Board considers that the Office would benefit 
</p>
<p>from strengthening its efforts and capacity together with relevant State institutions to 
</p>
<p>continue to provide support to turn into concrete capacity-building actions the specific 
</p>
<p>needs for protection of civil society space and the work of human rights defenders and 
</p>
<p>organizations that have played a critical role in supporting the advances made in the 
</p>
<p>country. This is particularly relevant in preparations for the next electoral period, during 
</p>
<p>which the Office could provide valuable advice within the framework of its thematic 
</p>
<p>strategy on widening democratic space.  
</p>
<p>25. The Board is of the view that the programme of the Regional Office for South-East 
</p>
<p>Asia is also in line with the expectations of main partners with whom the Board met, 
</p>
<p>including State officials and representatives of regional institutions and national human 
</p>
<p>rights mechanisms, civil society and United Nations partners. The Board encourages the 
</p>
<p>Office to continue to invest in strengthening the methodologies in place for thematic 
</p>
<p>research, and to improve mechanisms for data collection and data analysis and the 
</p>
<p>collection of lessons learned and good practices. The Board is particularly pleased with the 
</p>
<p>recent strengthening of the capacities of the Regional Office to respond to humanitarian 
</p>
<p>emergencies and to enlarge its thematic expertise, for example in the area of land-related 
</p>
<p>issues. The Board encourages OHCHR to continue to deploy thematic expertise to its 
</p>
<p>regional presences in order to make such expertise more readily available at the regional 
</p>
<p>and country levels. 
</p>
<p>26. The Board was most impressed again with the dedication and commitment of so 
</p>
<p>many of the OHCHR and other United Nations staff member that it met during its visits. 
</p>
<p>These officials work often in difficult and challenging contexts. They are often confronted 
</p>
<p>with situations where they are required to work in isolation from other colleagues and, in 
</p>
<p>many cases, from their families. Throughout its visits, the Board observed the incredible 
</p>
<p>added value of staff members who had experience from the different parts of the Office, </p>


<p>across regions and within various parts of the United Nations system in supporting building 
</p>
<p>solid programmes and partnerships on the ground. 
</p>
<p>27. As demonstrated throughout the recent visits and the discussions held with all 
</p>
<p>partners on the ground, direct exposure to the situation on the ground is particularly helpful 
</p>
<p>for the Board when identifying and proposing advice on ways to continue to strengthen the 
</p>
<p>technical cooperation of the Office. The availability of the Office and opportunities it has to 
</p>
<p>be present in places where action is needed and to use all possible tools within the full 
</p>
<p>scope of the mandate of the High Commissioner is critical for the implementation of 
</p>
<p>effective technical cooperation. During the Board&#8217;s visits to Africa, the Americas and Asia, 
</p>
<p>as in its latest thematic reports to the Human Rights Council on technical cooperation and 
</p>
<p>national policies and inclusive and participatory development,2 and in the annual reports of 
</p>
<p>the Office, numerous good practices yielding key measurable results have been identified 
</p>
<p>and documented. These are experiences that could be replicated or emulated in other parts 
</p>
<p>of the world.  
</p>
<p>28. The Board took the opportunity of part of its last day in Bangkok to hold an internal 
</p>
<p>meeting to continue discussions on its future programme. During the meeting, the Board 
</p>
<p>formally welcomed the two newly appointed members, Esi Sutherland-Addy and Valeriu 
</p>
<p>Nicolae. Lin Lim was elected chairperson of the Board to succeed Ms. Acosta from 1 July 
</p>
<p>2015. The Board also proposed to explore the possibility of focusing the next field session 
</p>
<p>in 2016 on the Europe and Central Asia Region and combining it with the shortened, 
</p>
<p>postponed annual session in Geneva. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Technical cooperation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Technical cooperation, the broadest possible participation of all 
</b></p>
<p><b>elements of national societies and its complementarity to efforts of 
</b></p>
<p><b>regional and subregional human rights mechanisms  
</b></p>
<p>29. The Board has brought to the attention of the Human Rights Council a number of 
</p>
<p>components for effective technical cooperation by OHCHR that have become evident in its 
</p>
<p>experience of overseeing the management of the Voluntary Fund. The Board, through its 
</p>
<p>reports and presentations to the Council, has already elaborated on (a) the importance of 
</p>
<p>anchoring technical cooperation to the universality and indivisibility of all human rights, 
</p>
<p>including its protection and promotion aspects; (b) the critical importance of building and 
</p>
<p>strengthening national frameworks and institutions in the field of human rights through 
</p>
<p>technical cooperation and advisory services with the support of OHCHR; and (c) the 
</p>
<p>importance of partnerships with United Nations entities on the ground.  
</p>
<p>30. As part of its programme of work for the coming years, the Board would like to 
</p>
<p>continue to elaborate on the main elements of the above-mentioned components, as it 
</p>
<p>considers that this could be beneficial for supporting the Office in the implementation of 
</p>
<p>the technical cooperation aspects of its programme for 2014-2017 and subsequent ones. In 
</p>
<p>the present report, the Board elaborates on its view that, for technical cooperation 
</p>
<p>programmes to be successful and effective, they should ensure the broadest possible 
</p>
<p>participation of all elements of national societies and be complementary to efforts of 
</p>
<p>regional and subregional human rights mechanisms, one of the mentioned components.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 A/HRC/27/41 and A/HRC/28/42. </p>


<p>31. Effective technical cooperation must be based on the broadest possible participation 
</p>
<p>and consultation with all the elements of national society. This aspect is a key element to 
</p>
<p>achieving the two main of objectives of technical cooperation, namely, to improve the 
</p>
<p>promotion and protection of human rights for all, and to ensure the sustainability of 
</p>
<p>outcomes.  
</p>
<p>32. The term &#8220;participation&#8221; should be understood as an inclusive term that refers to 
</p>
<p>engagement with all relevant actors in all the stages of the technical cooperation process, 
</p>
<p>from needs assessments to the design, formulation, implementation, monitoring and 
</p>
<p>evaluation of impact of these programmes. It should be noted that, in this case, both the 
</p>
<p>process and the outcome are equally important and mutually dependent. There can be no 
</p>
<p>good human rights outcome without a good human rights process. Investing in the full 
</p>
<p>participation of all sectors is crucial in ensuring that efforts to strengthen national protection 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, including through better legislation, policies and institutions, are built and 
</p>
<p>developed in a sustainable manner, and that investment continues to yield results once 
</p>
<p>technical support comes to an end.  
</p>
<p>33. Participation is a fundamental human rights principle &#8211; a human right in itself &#8211; and 
</p>
<p>central to the efficiency and sustainability of development efforts, including through 
</p>
<p>technical cooperation and assistance. It demands that all persons from all sectors of society 
</p>
<p>be entitled to active, free, meaningful and informed participation in any efforts of the State 
</p>
<p>aimed at realizing the full enjoyment of life in dignity. The enjoyment of the right to 
</p>
<p>participation depends on the realization of other human rights, including the rights to 
</p>
<p>freedom of association, assembly and expression, just to mention a few. To enable 
</p>
<p>meaningful participation, it is critical to ensure free access to information and full 
</p>
<p>transparency in decision-making processes. Numerous technical cooperation programmes at 
</p>
<p>the national level with the support of the United Nations are specifically designed to 
</p>
<p>support national efforts to enable an environment where these rights can be fully realized 
</p>
<p>and the fruits of those programmes enjoyed by all.  
</p>
<p>34. Women across regions and countries face deeply rooted challenges to their 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of equal participation in decision-making and leadership processes, in particular 
</p>
<p>women from marginalized and disadvantaged groups. Women are inadequately represented 
</p>
<p>in relevant community organizations, local settings and legal decision-making bodies, 
</p>
<p>which are essential avenues for ensuring participation. . Deeply rooted gender bias present 
</p>
<p>in many societies may require that quotas for women be established in, inter alia, education 
</p>
<p>and training programmes, and leadership positions in decision-making bodies, to achieve 
</p>
<p>gender equality and the empowerment of women. For these reasons, effective technical 
</p>
<p>cooperation programmes, and particularly those in the field of human rights, have to take 
</p>
<p>into account, at all stages from design through to implementation, all these limitations and 
</p>
<p>challenges, such as mobility, resources, caregiving responsibilities and lack of familiarity 
</p>
<p>with policies, to ensure that they do not constrain or limit the active participation of women 
</p>
<p>at any level. Some of the effective practices to ensure women&#8217;s participation include, for 
</p>
<p>example, actively looking for women&#8217;s inputs during the discussions, making sure that 
</p>
<p>women receive appropriate information to participate, offering child care during the 
</p>
<p>participatory processes, scheduling meetings in a way that is compatible with women&#8217;s care 
</p>
<p>responsibilities and where necessary, holding exclusive sessions for women.  
</p>
<p>35. During its visits to field presences and discussions held with State institutions, the 
</p>
<p>Board observed several obstacles to meaningful representation and innovative practices to 
</p>
<p>promote participation. Regrettably, opportunities to address properly the obstacles or to 
</p>
<p>share promising experiences are often limited. States and key stakeholders have recognized 
</p>
<p>in private meetings with the Board the key convening role that the Office plays in 
</p>
<p>supporting these consultative and participatory processes. The most recent report of the 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner on technical assistance to support inclusive and participatory </p>


<p>development and poverty reduction at the national level (A/HRC/28/42) included relevant 
</p>
<p>examples in the area of participation, some of which possible by the Fund, that could 
</p>
<p>inspire other States seeking support in this critical area.  
</p>
<p>36. The Board had the opportunity during its field session to visit some of the examples 
</p>
<p>included in the above-mentioned report and other relevant projects, and to discuss with the 
</p>
<p>relevant stakeholders and beneficiaries the ways in which effective and meaningful 
</p>
<p>participation had been and could be promoted through technical cooperation and advisory 
</p>
<p>services support. For example, during its visit to Mexico in 2014, the Board discussed with 
</p>
<p>the Ministry of the Interior the programmes in place with support from the OHCHR country 
</p>
<p>office for the development of the national human rights plan of action and State-level plans, 
</p>
<p>including the mechanisms for participation. In Coahuila, the Board had the opportunity to 
</p>
<p>see closely and discuss, with the Governor of the State and other relevant stakeholders, the 
</p>
<p>operationalization of the human rights plan of action at the State level. During its visit to 
</p>
<p>Mauritania in 2013, the Board learned about the capacity-building efforts of the OHCHR 
</p>
<p>country office in support of community coalitions working against slavery, succeeding in 
</p>
<p>having laws strengthened and working towards more effectively enforcement. In its recent 
</p>
<p>visit to Cambodia, the Board was particularly pleased by the level of recognition by the 
</p>
<p>authorities in the Ministry of the Interior of the convening role that the Office in Cambodia 
</p>
<p>was playing to support the Government in holding provincial dialogues and animating 
</p>
<p>participation of relevant groups, with particular emphasis on disadvantaged groups, 
</p>
<p>regarding critical current human rights issues, such as land rights.  
</p>
<p>37. The underrepresentation of most discriminated groups, including ethnic minorities, 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples&#8217; and other most disadvantaged groups, in both consultations and 
</p>
<p>decision-making processes remains a serious issue to be addressed when it comes to 
</p>
<p>ensuring meaningful and effective participation. Increased social exclusion and a widening 
</p>
<p>socioeconomic gap between the majorities and these groups is a challenge that needs 
</p>
<p>significantly better policies and action by all stakeholders involved. Capacity-building and 
</p>
<p>institutional support for individuals and organizations representing the most vulnerable and 
</p>
<p>discriminated groups needs to become more visible throughout the thematic strategies for 
</p>
<p>OHCHR offices and the programmes in place to implement these strategies. The Office has 
</p>
<p>developed on the basis of its years of experience numerous good practices through technical 
</p>
<p>cooperation programmes on, for example, indigenous peoples&#8217; participation; representation 
</p>
<p>and participation of persons belonging to minorities; and the full involvement of persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities in standard-setting processes. The Board encourages the Office to continue 
</p>
<p>to build on these experiences, joining forces also with the experience of other relevant 
</p>
<p>organizations, including regional human rights institutions and mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Synergy and partnerships with other United Nations entities  
</b></p>
<p>38. The Board continues to focus much of its attention on synergy and partnerships 
</p>
<p>among United Nations agencies and programmes in the area of technical cooperation in the 
</p>
<p>field of human rights during its sessions, in particular during its visits to OHCHR presences 
</p>
<p>in countries. The promotion and protection of human rights is one of the three pillars of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations and so is a responsibility shared by all United Nations agencies. Each can 
</p>
<p>contribute within its own mandate, complementing the work of the High Commissioner, for 
</p>
<p>greater effectiveness of the United Nations Organization as a whole. The Board is also 
</p>
<p>aware of the very few resources available to the High Commissioner in both absolute and 
</p>
<p>relative terms when compared with many other United Nations agencies, and of the need, 
</p>
<p>for the most practical of reasons, to encourage other United Nations agencies to share the 
</p>
<p>burden of implementing the human rights pillar. </p>


<p>39. Through the latest discussions with United Nations Resident Coordinators and 
</p>
<p>representatives of other United Nations agencies and programmes (for example from 
</p>
<p>Malaysia (via teleconference) and Thailand in 2015, as in Mexico in 2014 and previously in 
</p>
<p>Tunisia and Mauritania), the Board has had the opportunity to study the extent to which the 
</p>
<p>programme, priority focus and activities of the various types of OHCHR presences are also 
</p>
<p>in line with or respond to the main human rights issues and the demands from a variety of 
</p>
<p>country partners, and how they relate and are linked to the United Nations development 
</p>
<p>framework, other programming tools and joint United Nations development efforts on the 
</p>
<p>ground.  
</p>
<p>40. The Board has observed that the Office has managed to be extremely innovative and 
</p>
<p>active, taking into account the extremely limited at is disposal, and found it to be a reliable 
</p>
<p>and critical partner in joint capacity-building and advisory services provided by the United 
</p>
<p>Nations at the request of Governments.  
</p>
<p>41. The discussions with, for example, the Resident Coordinator in Malaysia served in 
</p>
<p>particular to gain an insight into the expectations facing the Office from the United Nations 
</p>
<p>system and how the Office can provide support from a regional presence, such as the 
</p>
<p>Regional Office for South-East Asia in Bangkok. During the discussions, the role of the 
</p>
<p>Office in ensuring the mainstreaming of human rights throughout the work of United 
</p>
<p>Nations country teams was particularly stressed, as was the capacity of the Office to 
</p>
<p>provide timely and substantive advice on relevant normative human rights issues. All 
</p>
<p>United Nations partners, however, recognized that an adequately staffed and mandated 
</p>
<p>presence of the Office is a key factor in providing adequate assistance to jointly develop 
</p>
<p>technical cooperation programmes at the request and in close cooperation with relevant 
</p>
<p>State entities.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Measuring results of technical cooperation, and the response of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Office of the High Commissioner 
</b></p>
<p>42. At its most recent sessions in Geneva and particularly in the field, the Board 
</p>
<p>witnessed how OHCHR has now in practice moved to measuring impact at the State level 
</p>
<p>and to monitoring programme implementation through the full use of the performance 
</p>
<p>monitoring system by all its presences and all structures at Headquarters. The utility of the 
</p>
<p>system has been further proven in 2015 during the programme review conducted in the 
</p>
<p>context of the Office&#8217;s efforts to address its difficult financial situation. Board members are 
</p>
<p>very encouraged by the impressive results that the increased, systematic and better use of 
</p>
<p>the system is helping to achieve.  
</p>
<p>43. During its sessions in the field in 2015, the Board has been able to observe in 
</p>
<p>particular how the system, which interlinks planning, monitoring, the production of reports 
</p>
<p>and sharing experiences, allows the Office to monitor the implementation of its 
</p>
<p>programmes in real time and to make the adjustments necessary to ensure the achievement 
</p>
<p>of the defined results. The Board also finds it encouraging that field presences increasingly 
</p>
<p>use the system to identify examples of good practices to use when designing their own 
</p>
<p>programmes.  
</p>
<p>44. The Board commends OHCHR for its efforts to ensure the full functioning and use 
</p>
<p>of the system by all its planning entities. It believes that the next challenges for OHCHR are 
</p>
<p>to improve the production of reports by upgrading the capacity of staff to upload accurate 
</p>
<p>and relevant information; and to further improve use of the system by senior managers in 
</p>
<p>their daily work and decision-making. Although the upgrades implemented in recent years, 
</p>
<p>including the financial module, are assessed very favourably by the Board, there is a need 
</p>
<p>to develop them further and to align them with other administrative and financial tracking </p>


<p>systems of the Office. The Board encourages the United Nations Secretariat to ensure that 
</p>
<p>the transition of OHCHR to the new Umoja resource planning system will not have a 
</p>
<p>negative impact on the achievements of the performance monitoring system, but will rather 
</p>
<p>strengthen it further. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Guidance tools on technical cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>45. As one of the vehicles used by OHCHR to fulfil the mandate of the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner, technical cooperation continues to be an effective means for overcoming 
</p>
<p>gaps in-country knowledge and capacity, and for supporting efforts made by the country to 
</p>
<p>address them. For technical cooperation programmes to be effective, they need to be based 
</p>
<p>on a comprehensive situation analysis and a thorough assessment of capacity and other 
</p>
<p>critical shortfalls. The efforts and increased guidance of the Office towards strengthening 
</p>
<p>its planning and programming guidance tools (in particular in preparation of the 
</p>
<p>organizational management plan for the period 2014-2017) have further developed its 
</p>
<p>capacities to respond better to the needs identified and the requests for technical and 
</p>
<p>advisory services on the ground by, for example, developing further the process of 
</p>
<p>consultation with main stakeholders.  
</p>
<p>46. OHCHR has continued to develop and provide specific reference tools relevant to 
</p>
<p>technical cooperation in order to guide its field presences and staff on the approach of 
</p>
<p>OHCHR to technical cooperation and to ensure access to updated OHCHR policies, 
</p>
<p>practices and procedures relating to technical cooperation and results-based management. 
</p>
<p>47. The Board found the efforts of the Office to use the gains and experiences reflected 
</p>
<p>in a study on the protection impact of United Nations human rights field presences3 
</p>
<p>particularly relevant to strengthening the capacities of the staff of the Office in its field 
</p>
<p>presences through follow-up training and seminars. In all its visits, the Board has observed 
</p>
<p>with satisfaction the recognition by State entities, national human rights institutions and 
</p>
<p>civil society organizations of the engagement efforts of the Office and its staff, and its 
</p>
<p>ability to maintain trust while being able to discuss difficult issues frankly, building on its 
</p>
<p>observance and monitoring work, and to adapt to changing environments without losing 
</p>
<p>focus. The OHCHR office in Mexico, for example, which receives support from the Fund, 
</p>
<p>has benefited from these capacity-building efforts. The Board welcomes the plans of the 
</p>
<p>Office to continue to strengthen capacities on the ground, building on these useful 
</p>
<p>experiences and lessons learned.  
</p>
<p>48. The Voluntary Fund has traditionally provided support for the deployment of human 
</p>
<p>rights advisers to United Nations Resident Coordinators and country teams. Since 2012, all 
</p>
<p>deployments are operated under a new framework formulated by the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Development Group and supported by a dedicated multi-donor trust fund For this reason, 
</p>
<p>human rights advisers deployed prior to the endorsement of the framework in 2012 policy 
</p>
<p>(and therefore supported financially by the Voluntary Fund) work alongside advisers by the 
</p>
<p>above- mentioned multi-donor trust fund. The Board has commended the Office for its 
</p>
<p>efforts to align all deployments, regardless of the source of funding, with the mentioned 
</p>
<p>policy. It also welcomes recent initiatives aimed at strengthening the results-based 
</p>
<p>management capacities of human rights advisers. As the number of deployments has 
</p>
<p>increased in response to growing demand, such initiatives as the global workshop for 
</p>
<p>human rights advisers, held in Geneva from 30 June to 4 July 2014 and aimed at 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 Liam Mahony and Roger Nash, <i>Influence on the Ground: Understanding and Strengthening the 
</i></p>
<p><i>Protection Impact of United Nations Human Rights Field Presences</i> (Brewster, Massachusetts, 
</p>
<p>Fieldview Solutions, 2012).  </p>


<p>strengthening the capacity of all human rights advisers through the sharing of experiences 
</p>
<p>and practices, are most welcome.  
</p>
<p>49. The Board encourages OHCHR to continue to develop this type of initiative for all 
</p>
<p>types of field presences receiving support from the Voluntary Fund for Technical 
</p>
<p>Cooperation, to complete the manual on technical cooperation, and to update it regularly. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Main findings, challenges identified and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>50. During its visits to OHCHR field presences, the thematically focused sessions in 
</p>
<p>Geneva, the follow-up engagement and advice on the implementation of the thematic 
</p>
<p>strategies within the programming cycle 2014-2017 and the increasing number of 
</p>
<p>opportunities to observe the complementarities of the support through the two funds, the 
</p>
<p>Board has broadened its overview of the programmes of the Office, its technical 
</p>
<p>cooperation components and the connections with other work of the Office and of other 
</p>
<p>United Nations programmes. This has substantially expanded the opportunities for strategic 
</p>
<p>and policy advice on the technical cooperation components of the support provided by 
</p>
<p>OHCHR.  
</p>
<p>51. Through its discussions with all partners on the ground, the Board has been able to 
</p>
<p>confirm its view that the often artificial separation between the various types of work that 
</p>
<p>OHCHR undertakes to support States in their responsibility to ensure fulfilment of human 
</p>
<p>rights for all does not always reflect the reality of needs and requests on the ground. 
</p>
<p>Another important role played by the Office is that of guiding, through technical 
</p>
<p>cooperation and advisory services, not only States and other national stakeholders but also 
</p>
<p>other parts of the United Nations family on ways to ensure the promotion and protection of 
</p>
<p>human rights in their programmes. These elements should be taken into account to fully 
</p>
<p>understand the term &#8220;technical cooperation&#8221; in the field of human rights, to be provided by 
</p>
<p>OHCHR in full accordance with the mandate of the High Commissioner. The Board very 
</p>
<p>much hopes that its views regarding the components of effective technical cooperation will 
</p>
<p>help to further a common understanding, bridging the gap between what external audiences 
</p>
<p>often expect and understand by technical cooperation and what the Office and the United 
</p>
<p>Nations in general can do to provide at the current times and within their respective 
</p>
<p>mandates. 
</p>
<p>52. The Board is impressed by the innovative approaches and the large number of good 
</p>
<p>practices and lessons learned across the Office that could further strengthen the programme 
</p>
<p>of the Office and indeed of other United Nations agencies, if adequately and timely shared 
</p>
<p>within regions and across regions. While understanding the lack of resources and the 
</p>
<p>challenges on the ground for many members of the United Nations family, the Board has 
</p>
<p>been particularly encouraged by the commitments and the capacity of OHCHR staff on the 
</p>
<p>ground to confront challenges and to develop innovative solutions and proposals. Over the 
</p>
<p>past five years, the Board has noted an increased effort by the Office to promote the sharing 
</p>
<p>of good practices in the context of its planning exercise and through important internal 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, such as the annual meeting of heads of field presences, in Geneva. This 
</p>
<p>practice is most welcome and should be further strengthened, and the tools for sharing 
</p>
<p>experiences further developed. 
</p>
<p>53.  The Board stresses the importance of continuing to strengthen the capacities and 
</p>
<p>abilities of the staff of OHCHR, particularly of those working in the field. The Board would 
</p>
<p>recommend that the guidance issued on resource mobilization at the field level be 
</p>
<p>accompanied also by a strengthened capacity-building programme for those engaged in 
</p>
<p>fundraising at the local level to ensure that the efforts made yield the expected results.  </p>


<p>54. The Secretariat should support OHCHR to put in place adequate mechanisms for 
</p>
<p>career development, taking into account the sometimes extremely difficult circumstances in 
</p>
<p>which staff operate, in particular in crisis situations. The new measures taken by the 
</p>
<p>Secretariat to ensure mobility of OHCHR and other United Nations staff members between 
</p>
<p>duty stations are most welcome. The Board would like to ensure that these measures do not 
</p>
<p>weaken but rather strengthen and support the years of investment in building robust human 
</p>
<p>rights expertise in the staff of the United Nations. This would be critical for the Office&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>capacity to effectively meet the increasing requests from Member States for technical 
</p>
<p>cooperation. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Status of funding and donors 
</b></p>
<p>55. At its meetings in October 2014 and February 2015, the Board was updated on the 
</p>
<p>overall financial status of OHCHR and its donors, the financial situation ofr 2014 of the 
</p>
<p>Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights and its functioning 
</p>
<p>in the overall funding system, including interlinkages with other extrabudgetary resources, 
</p>
<p>and the funding projections and proposed work plan for the Fund for 2015. Expenditures 
</p>
<p>under the Fund had again increased throughout 2014 without being matched by financial 
</p>
<p>contributions, a situation that the Board brings constantly to the attention of the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council in its annual updates.  
</p>
<p>56. In 2014, the total expenditure of the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in 
</p>
<p>the Field of Human Rights amounted to $20.2 million. The Fund received a total of $17.7 
</p>
<p>million in voluntary contributions, of which $9.7 million were earmarked and $8 million 
</p>
<p>were allocated to the Fund from unearmarked contributions to OHCHR. The resulting 
</p>
<p>deficit of $2.5 million at the end of 2014 was covered from other existing reserves. During 
</p>
<p>this period, the Fund continued to provide resources for technical cooperation to build 
</p>
<p>strong human rights frameworks at the national level in 30 regions, States and territories. 
</p>
<p>This included support for 16 human rights advisers (in Chad, Ecuador, Honduras, Kenya, 
</p>
<p>Madagascar, the Niger, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Maldives, the Republic of Moldova, 
</p>
<p>the Russian Federation, Rwanda, South Caucasus (Georgia), Sri Lanka, Timor-Leste and 
</p>
<p>Ukraine); eight human rights components of peace missions (in Afghanistan, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, 
</p>
<p>Darfur (Sudan), Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Liberia, Libya and Somalia) and six country/stand-
</p>
<p>alone offices (Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Kosovo,4 Mauritania, Mexico, Togo and the 
</p>
<p>State of Palestine). Details of contributions and programmes are provided in the annual 
</p>
<p>report of OHCHR for 2014. 
</p>
<p>57. Through the Fund, the Office has facilitated efforts made at the country level to 
</p>
<p>incorporate international human rights standards into national laws, policies and practices, 
</p>
<p>and contributed to the establishment and strengthening of national capacities to adhere to 
</p>
<p>these standards. Strengthening the administration of justice and increasing capacities to 
</p>
<p>promote gender equality and women&#8217;s rights have also been the focus of numerous 
</p>
<p>programmes receiving support from the Fund. Through the newly established thematic 
</p>
<p>priority on widening democratic space, greater engagement on the establishment and 
</p>
<p>functioning of responsive national human rights institutions and on human rights education 
</p>
<p>programmes have been facilitated. United Nations Resident Coordinators and country 
</p>
<p>teams have also seen their human rights capacity strengthened by the continuing 
</p>
<p>deployment of human rights advisers. Detailed information on income and expenditure 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 4 Reference to Kosovo should be understood in full compliance with Security Council resolution 1244 
</p>
<p>(1999) and without prejudice to the status of Kosovo. </p>


<p>under the Voluntary Fund, its financial status in 2014 and a list of donors and contributors 
</p>
<p>are annexed to the present report (see annexes I &#8211; IV). 
</p>
<p>58. In its sessions and meetings with OHCHR and Member States, the Board continues 
</p>
<p>to underline the importance of ensuring sustainable increased contributions to OHCHR and 
</p>
<p>to the Fund, and reiterates its view that an increase in unearmarked funds will allow 
</p>
<p>OHCHR to be more flexible in implementing identified priorities and to better respond to 
</p>
<p>increasing needs. </p>
