Suncor Energy reports second quarter results
All financial figures are unaudited and presented in Canadian dollars (Cdn$) unless noted otherwise. Production volumes are presented on a working-
interest basis, before royalties, unless noted otherwise. Certain financial measures referred to in this document are not prescribed by Canadian generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP). For a description of these non-GAAP financial measures, see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Advisory section
of Suncor's Management's Discussion and Analysis, dated July 30, 2014 (the MD&A). See also the Advisories section of the MD&A. References to Oil
Sands operations production and cash operating costs exclude Suncor's interest in Syncrude's operations.
"We continue to generate strong cash flow quarter after quarter," said Steve Williams, Suncor president and chief
executive officer. "In the second quarter, we took advantage of strong upstream pricing to generate $2.4 billion of cash
flow from operations. We also reduced our cash operating costs per barrel at Oil Sands operations by 27% from the
second quarter of 2013, thanks to a strong ramp up of Firebag production and our commitment to cost management."

Operating earnings(1) of $1.135 billion ($0.77 per common share) and net earnings of $211 million ($0.14 per
common share). Net earnings included after-tax impairment charges of $718 million against the company's interest
in the Joslyn mining project, $297 million against the company's Libyan assets, and $223 million related to other Oil
Sands assets.
Quarterly cash flow from operations(1) of $2.406 billion ($1.64 per common share), and a 66% increase in free cash
flow(1) to $3.599 billion for the twelve months ended June 30, 2014, over the prior year period.
Increased production at Firebag, combined with the company's continued focus on cost management, enabled
Suncor to achieve cash operating costs per barrel(1) of $34.10 for Oil Sands operations.
Decision made to scale back certain development activities at the Joslyn mining project, reinforcing Suncor's
disciplined approach to capital allocation and commitment to driving higher returns.
Outlook for 2014 capital expenditures reduced to $6.8 billion from $7.8 billion, demonstrating Suncor's ongoing
commitment to capital discipline.
Suncor's Board of Directors has approved a dividend of $0.28 per common share, a 22% increase over the previous
quarter dividend, reinforcing the company's commitment and ability to return cash to shareholders.

ROCE, excluding the impacts of the Voyageur impairment for the second quarter of 2013, would have been 12.5%, and for the third quarter of
2013, would have been 12.9%. ROCE, excluding the impacts of impairments of $1.238 billion recorded in the second quarter of 2014, would
have been 13.1% for the second quarter of 2014.
Financial Results
Suncor Energy Inc. delivered solid financial results in the second quarter of 2014, including operating earnings of
$1.135 billion ($0.77 per common share) and cash flow from operations of $2.406 billion ($1.64 per common share),
compared to $934 million ($0.62 per common share) and $2.250 billion ($1.49 per common share), respectively, in the prior
year quarter. Current quarter results were led by increased production at Oil Sands and strong upstream price realizations,
partially offset by lower production volumes in Exploration and Production, as well as higher share-based compensation
expense and natural gas input costs. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2014, free cash flow increased to
$3.599 billion, compared to $2.167 billion for the twelve months ended June 30, 2013.
Net earnings were $211 million ($0.14 per common share) for the second quarter of 2014, compared with net earnings of
$680 million ($0.45 per common share) for the prior year quarter. Net earnings for the second quarter of 2014 were
negatively impacted by after-tax impairment charges of $718 million on the company's interest in the Joslyn mining project,
$297 million against the company's Libyan assets, and $223 million in Oil Sands following a review of certain assets that
no longer fit with Suncor's previously revised growth strategies and which could not be repurposed or otherwise deployed.
These factors were partially offset by after-tax earnings of $32 million related to a reserves redetermination in the
Exploration and Production segment, and the impact of an after-tax foreign exchange gain on the revaluation of U.S. dollar
denominated debt of $282 million, compared to an after-tax foreign exchange loss of $254 million in the prior year quarter.
Operating Results
"Before we outline our operating results, I want to affirm our ongoing commitment to safety," said Williams. "I am deeply
saddened by the fatalities in the first half of the year. Our entire organization is engaged in improving our safety
performance. Safety is our number one value and a critical part of operational excellence."
Suncor's current quarterly results continued to benefit from a profitable portfolio comprising nearly 100% crude-oil weighted
production, compared to 91% in the prior year quarter. Suncor's total upstream production was 518,400 barrels of oil
equivalent per day (boe/d) in the second quarter of 2014, an increase from 500,100 boe/d in the prior year quarter,
reflecting higher production volumes in Oil Sands, partially offset by the sale of the conventional natural gas business and
negligible production in Libya.
Production volumes for Oil Sands operations increased to an average of 378,800 barrels per day (bbls/d) in the second
quarter of 2014, compared to 276,600 bbls/d in the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower planned and unplanned
maintenance in the current year quarter compared to the prior year quarter, which included the impacts of the Upgrader 1
turnaround. Production in the current year quarter included the successful ramp up of Firebag, following the commissioning
of the hot bitumen infrastructure assets in the third quarter of 2013. Production in the current year quarter further benefited
from strong Firebag infill well performance which was partially offset by planned and unplanned maintenance events in
upgrading and extraction, as well as a third-party pipeline outage which decreased takeaway capacity.
Cash operating costs per barrel for Oil Sands operations decreased in the second quarter of 2014 to an average of
$34.10/bbl, compared to $46.55/bbl in the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher production volumes. Total cash
operating costs remained consistent with the prior year, despite the increase in production and higher natural gas
input costs.
Suncor's share of Syncrude production decreased to 24,300 bbls/d in the second quarter of 2014 from 32,800 bbls/d in the
prior year quarter, due primarily to planned and unplanned coker maintenance.
Production volumes for the Exploration and Production segment decreased to 115,300 boe/d in the second quarter of 2014,
compared to 190,700 boe/d in the prior year quarter, primarily due to the sale of the company's conventional natural gas
business and negligible production in Libya due to continued political unrest.
During the second quarter of 2014, Refining and Marketing successfully completed a five-week planned maintenance event
at the Montreal refinery and a seven-week planned maintenance event at the Edmonton refinery, resulting in a decrease in
average refinery utilization to 85% compared to 90% in the prior year quarter.
Strategy Update
The company allocates its capital according to a clear set of priorities: ensuring sustainable and reliable operations,
investing in profitable growth and delivering strong returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the
second quarter of 2014, Suncor delivered value to shareholders through $338 million in dividends ($0.23 per common
2   SUNCOR ENERGY INC. 2014 SECOND QUARTER
share) and $271 million in share repurchases, demonstrating the company's ongoing commitment to deliver cash to
shareholders through dividends and value-driven share repurchases.
Further delivering on this commitment, subsequent to the quarter, Suncor's Board of Directors approved a quarterly
dividend of $0.28 per common share, a 22% increase over the previous dividend.
"We continue to focus squarely on profitable growth. This means we're disciplined with our capital and invest wisely in
high-return projects," said Williams. "This prudent approach and our cash generating ability have enabled us to increase
our quarterly dividend to shareholders."
Investing in Integration and Market Access
Suncor's solid financial quarter was in part due to further integration and market access initiatives that ramped up in the
second quarter of 2014. Refining and Marketing increased rail shipments of inland priced crudes to the Montreal refinery to
36,000 bbls/d in the second quarter of 2014 and continued marine shipments of lower priced crudes from the U.S. Gulf
Coast to the Montreal refinery when market conditions were favourable. In July 2014, the company completed the
acquisition of a sulphur recovery facility for approximately $120 million that will be integrated into the Montreal refinery
operations and is expected to secure the refinery's long-term sulphur recovery needs.
The company also continued to transport crude on TransCanada's Gulf Coast pipeline which has provided more than
70,000 bbls/d of increased access to U.S. Gulf Coast pricing for both light and heavy crudes. The company's integrated
model and strong market access position resulted in Suncor capturing global-based pricing on volumes equivalent to nearly
100% of its upstream production in the second quarter of 2014.
Oil Sands Operations
Suncor continues to focus on investments in its tailings management and water management strategies. As part of the
water management strategy, Suncor commissioned a water treatment plant in the second quarter of 2014, which is
expected to increase the reuse and recycling of waste water and reduce freshwater withdrawal. During the second quarter
of 2014, Suncor, along with five other project partners, also approved the construction of a Water Technology Development
Centre (WTDC) scheduled to become operational in early 2017. The WTDC will connect to Suncor's Firebag operations,
providing an environment to test water treatment and recycling technologies without affecting production at the in
situ facility.
The company reached a milestone in the second quarter by achieving first steam on the well pads associated with the
MacKay River facility debottleneck project, with first oil expected in the third quarter of 2014. The debottleneck project is
intended to increase production capacity by approximately 20%, for total capacity of 38,000 bbls/d by the end of 2015.
Suncor also continues to work towards a 2014 sanction decision on the MacKay River expansion project, which is targeted
to have an initial design capacity of approximately 20,000 bbls/d. In addition, Suncor continues to advance further
debottlenecking initiatives in logistics infrastructure and at the Firebag facilities.

Oil Sands Ventures
Fort Hills mining project activities continue to focus on detailed engineering, procurement and the ramp up of field
construction activities. Detailed engineering work was approximately 40% complete by the end of the second quarter. Key
construction activities during the quarter included foundation concrete pours and commencing with construction of primary
extraction separation cells. The project is expected to provide Suncor with approximately 73,000 bbls/d of bitumen, with
first oil expected in the fourth quarter of 2017 and reaching 90% of its planned capacity within twelve months thereafter.
In May 2014, Total E&P Canada Ltd. (Total E&P), the operator of the Joslyn mining project, together with Suncor and the
other co-owners of the project, agreed to scale back certain development activities in order to focus on engineering studies
to further optimize the project development plan. As a result of Suncor's assessment of expected future net cashflows and
the uncertainty of the project, including the timing of the development plans, Suncor recorded an after-tax charge to net
earnings of $718 million against its interest in the project. Suncor continues to believe that Joslyn is a quality resource with
development potential given the right design and execution strategy and continues to work with Total E&P and the other
co-owners to explore ways to further optimize the project development plan.
Exploration and Production
A significant milestone was reached at the Golden Eagle project in the second quarter with the successful installation of
key offshore facilities. Drilling activities continued in the quarter, and the project remains on track to achieve first oil in late
2014 or early 2015. At the Hebron project, construction of the gravity-based structure and topsides continued in the second
quarter of 2014, with the project expected to achieve first oil in 2017. In addition, the company signed a farm-in agreement
with Shell Canada to acquire a 20% interest in a deepwater exploration opportunity in the Shelburne Basin, offshore
Nova Scotia.
The company has a number of extension projects in East Coast Canada, which leverage existing facilities and
infrastructure. Following the completion of subsea installation for the Hibernia Southern Extension Unit in 2013, drilling
activities continued in the second quarter of 2014. The second phase of the South White Rose Extension project continued
in the second quarter of 2014. The Hibernia Southern Extension Unit and South White Rose Extension projects are
expected to increase overall production starting in 2015 and extend the productive life of the existing fields. A funding
decision for further development of the Ben Nevis-Avalon reservoir at Hibernia is expected in the third quarter of 2014. A
sanction decision for further expansion into the West White Rose field is targeted for late 2014.
Political unrest that impacted the Libyan export terminal operations in the second half of 2013 continued into the first half
of 2014. In July 2014, the last two affected terminals were reopened and the Libya National Oil Company announced the
lifting of force majeure on oil exports from these terminals. However, the region remains volatile and the timing of oil sales
and the company's ability to return to normal production levels remains uncertain. As a result, Suncor recorded an after-tax
charge to net earnings of $297 million against its assets in Libya.

Normal Course Issuer Bid
Subsequent to June 30, 2014, the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) accepted a notice filed by Suncor of its intention to
renew its normal course issuer bid (the NCIB) to continue to purchase shares under its previously announced buyback
program through the facilities of the TSX, New York Stock Exchange and/or alternative trading platforms. The notice
provides that Suncor may purchase for cancellation up to approximately $1.1 billion worth of its common shares beginning
August 5, 2014 and ending August 4, 2015.
The actual number of common shares that may be purchased and the timing of any such purchases will be determined by
Suncor. Suncor believes that, depending on the trading price of its common shares and other relevant factors, purchasing
its own shares represents an attractive investment opportunity and is in the best interests of the company and its
shareholders. Between July 23, 2013 and July 23, 2014, and pursuant to Suncor's previously announced normal course
issuer bids, Suncor successfully completed the purchase of approximately $1.7 billion worth of its common shares
(44,877,773), at a weighted average price of $37.85 per common share. As at July 23, 2014, Suncor had
1,465,260,522 common shares issued and outstanding. Pursuant to the NCIB, Suncor has agreed that it will not purchase
more than 44,045,388 common shares, which is equal to approximately 3% of Suncor's issued and outstanding
common shares.
Subject to the 'block purchase exemption' that is available to Suncor for regular open market purchases under the NCIB,
Suncor will limit daily purchases of Suncor common shares on the TSX in connection with the NCIB to no more than 25%
(604,298) of the average daily trading volume of Suncor's common shares on the TSX during any trading day. In the future,
Suncor may enter into an automatic share purchase plan in relation to purchases made in connection with the NCIB.
Amendments and Additions to By-laws, including Advance Notice
In order to meet recommended good governance practices, Suncor's Board of Directors (the Board) has approved an
amendment to Suncor's general operating by-law (By-Law No. 1) to: (i) change the quorum for shareholder meetings to 25%
from 10%; and (ii) remove the casting vote previously granted to the Chair of directors' and shareholders' meetings.
In addition, the Board has approved an advance notice by-law (By-Law No. 2) for Suncor. Among other things, By-Law
No. 2 fixes a deadline by which shareholders must submit a notice of director nominations to Suncor prior to any annual or
special meeting of shareholders where directors are to be elected and sets forth the information that a shareholder must
include in the notice for it to be valid. Advance notice by-laws benefit shareholders by facilitating an orderly and efficient
meeting process, ensuring that all shareholders receive adequate notice of director nominations and sufficient information
with respect to all nominees. This allows Suncor and shareholders to evaluate each nominee's qualifications and suitability
as a director of Suncor so shareholders can cast an informed vote.
The amended By-Law No. 1 and By-Law No. 2 are effective immediately, subject to confirmation and ratification by the
shareholders. At the next meeting of shareholders of Suncor, shareholders will be asked to confirm and ratify the amended
By-Law No. 1 and By-Law No.2. The full text of each of the amended By-Law No. 1 and By-Law No. 2 have been filed
under Suncor's profile at www.sedar.com, and posted on Suncor's website at www.suncor.com.
Measurement Conversions
Certain crude oil and natural gas liquids volumes in this report to shareholders have been converted to mcfe on the basis
of one bbl to six mcf. Also, certain natural gas volumes have been converted to boe or mboe on the same basis. See the
Measurement Conversions section of the MD&A.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Certain financial measures in this MD&A – namely operating earnings, cash flow from operations, free cash flow, return on
capital employed (ROCE), Oil Sands cash operating costs and last-in, first-out (LIFO) – are not prescribed by GAAP.
Operating earnings, Oil Sands cash operating costs and LIFO are defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Advisory
section of this MD&A and reconciled to GAAP measures in the Segment Results and Analysis section of this MD&A.
Cash flow from operations, free cash flow and ROCE are defined and reconciled to GAAP measures in the Non-GAAP
Financial Measures Advisory section of this MD&A.
These non-GAAP financial measures are included because management uses this information to analyze operating
performance, leverage and liquidity. These non-GAAP financial measures do not have any standardized meaning and,
therefore, are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies and should not be considered
in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Information
The company's financial and operational performance is potentially affected by a number of factors, including, but not
limited to, the volatility of commodity prices and exchange rate fluctuations; operational outages and major environmental
or safety incidents; project execution; cost management; government policy, including changes to royalty and income tax
legislation; environmental regulation, including changes to climate change and reclamation legislation; skills and resources
shortages; change capacity; and other factors described within the Forward-Looking Information section of this document.
A more detailed discussion of the risk factors affecting the company is presented in the Risk Factors section of the 2013
annual MD&A and the 2013 AIF.
This document contains forward-looking information based on Suncor's current expectations, estimates, projections and
assumptions. This information is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in this
document and Suncor's other disclosure documents, many of which are beyond the company's control. Users of this
information are cautioned that actual results may differ materially. Refer to the Forward-Looking Information section of this
document for information on the material risk factors and assumptions underlying our forward-looking information.
Measurement Conversions
Certain crude oil and natural gas liquids volumes have been converted to mcfe on the basis of one bbl to six mcf. Also,
certain natural gas volumes have been converted to boe or mboe on the same basis. Any figure presented in mcfe, boe or
mboe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A conversion ratio of one bbl of crude oil or natural gas liquids to
six mcf of natural gas is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does
not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as
compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, conversion on a 6:1 basis may be
misleading as an indication of value.

2. SECOND QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
•

•
•
Solid second quarter financial results.
•
•
•
•
Net earnings for the second quarter of 2014 were $211 million, compared to $680 million for the prior year
quarter. Net earnings for the quarter included after-tax impairment charges of $718 million on the company's
interest in the Joslyn mining project, $297 million against the company's Libyan assets, and $223 million in
Oil Sands following a review of certain assets that no longer fit with Suncor's previously revised growth
strategies and which could not be repurposed or otherwise deployed. These factors were partially offset by
after-tax earnings of $32 million related to a reserves redetermination in the Exploration and Production
segment, and the impact of an after-tax foreign exchange gain on the revaluation of U.S. dollar denominated
debt of $282 million, compared to an after-tax foreign exchange loss of $254 million in the prior year quarter.
Operating earnings(1) for the second quarter of 2014 were $1.135 billion, compared to $934 million for the
prior year quarter, and were led by increased production at Oil Sands which allowed the company to take
advantage of a strong upstream pricing environment. These positive factors were partially offset by lower
production in the Exploration and Production segment, and an increase in operating costs, including the
impact of higher share-based compensation expense and natural gas input costs.
Cash flow from operations(1) was $2.406 billion for the second quarter of 2014, compared to $2.250 billion for
the second quarter of 2013, and was impacted by the same factors that affected operating earnings. Free
cash flow(1) increased to $3.599 billion for the twelve months ended June 30, 2014, compared to
$2.167 billion for the twelve months ended June 30, 2013.
ROCE(1) (excluding major projects in progress) increased to 10.1% for the twelve months ended June 30,
2014, compared to 8.1% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2013. ROCE for the twelve months ended
June 30, 2014 was reduced by 3.0% due to after-tax impairment charges of $1.238 billion recognized in the
current year quarter as noted above. ROCE for the twelve months ended June 30, 2013 was reduced by
4.4% due to an after-tax impairment charge of $1.487 billion relating to the Voyageur upgrader project in the
fourth quarter of 2012, in addition to an after-tax impairment charge of $127 million recorded in the first
quarter of 2013 as a result of not proceeding with the project.
Operational flexibility minimizes impacts of maintenance.  The company leveraged its operational flexibility in
the second quarter of 2014 by diverting Firebag bitumen through the hot bitumen infrastructure to increase bitumen
sales during planned and unplanned upgrader maintenance.
Oil Sands operations cash operating costs averaged $34.10/bbl for the quarter.  Increased production,
combined with the company's continued focus on cost management, enabled Suncor to achieve cash operating
costs per barrel of $34.10. Total cash operating costs in the second quarter of 2014 remained flat with the prior year
quarter despite a 37% increase in production volumes and higher natural gas input costs.
Successful ramp up of crude by rail shipments to Montreal refinery.  Crude by rail shipments to the company's
Montreal refinery increased from an average of 20,000 bbls/d in the first quarter of 2014 to an average of
36,000 bbls/d in the second quarter of 2014, allowing the Montreal refinery to access less expensive inland crude
feedstock.

Outlook for 2014 capital expenditures reduced from $7.8 billion to $6.8 billion.  Anticipated capital spending
for 2014 has been reduced, consistent with the company's ongoing commitment to capital discipline. The forecasted
capital reduction includes deferred spending on pre-sanction growth projects to optimize project economics,
cancellation of sustaining capital projects that are not critical for safe and reliable operations, delays in offshore
exploratory drilling programs, and suspension of activities in Libya.
Suncor continues to deliver cash to shareholders.  In the second quarter of 2014, Suncor delivered value to
shareholders through $338 million in dividends ($0.23 per common share) and $271 million in share repurchases. In
addition, subsequent to the quarter, Suncor's Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.28 per common share
payable in the third quarter of 2014, a 22% increase over the previous quarter dividend, reinforcing the company's
commitment and ability to return cash to shareholders.
Operating earnings, cash flow from operations, free cash flow and ROCE are non-GAAP financial measures. See the Non-GAAP Financial

Suncor's consolidated net earnings for the second quarter of 2014 were $211 million, compared to $680 million for the prior
year quarter. Net earnings for the first six months of 2014 were $1.696 billion, compared to $1.774 billion in the prior year
period. Net earnings were primarily affected by the same factors that influenced operating earnings described subsequently
in this section of the MD&A. Other items affecting net earnings over these periods include:
•
•
•
•
•
The after-tax unrealized foreign exchange gain on the revaluation of U.S. dollar denominated debt was $282 million
for the second quarter of 2014 and a $26 million foreign exchange loss for the first six months of 2014. The after-tax
unrealized foreign exchange loss on the revaluation of U.S. dollar denominated long-term debt was $254 million for
the second quarter of 2013 and $400 million for the first six months of 2013.
In the second quarter of 2014, Total E&P Canada Ltd. ("Total E&P"), the operator of the Joslyn mining project,
together with Suncor and the other co-owners of the project agreed to scale back certain development activities in
order to focus on engineering studies to further optimize the Joslyn project deveopment plan. As a result of
Suncor's assessment of expected future net cash flows and the uncertainty of the project, including the timing of
the development plans, Suncor recorded an after-tax charge to net earnings of $718 million against property, plant
and equipment and exploration and evaluation assets.
As a result of the continued closure of certain Libyan export terminals during the quarter and the company's latest
view on production plans during the remaining term of the production sharing agreements, Suncor estimated the net
recoverable value of its assets in Libya based on an assessment of expected future net cash flows over a range of
possible outcomes. As a result of this assessment, the company recorded an after-tax impairment charge of
$297 million against property, plant and equipment and exploration and evaluation assets.
In the second quarter of 2014, the company recorded after-tax impairment charges of $223 million in Oil Sands
following a review of certain assets that no longer fit with Suncor's previously revised growth strategies and which
could not be repurposed or otherwise deployed. Such assets included a pipeline and related compressor, as well as
steam generator components.
In the second quarter of 2014, the company recorded after-tax earnings of $32 million related to an agreement
reached for Suncor to receive a reserves redetermination of 1.2 million barrels of oil related to an interest in a
Norwegian asset that Suncor previously owned.

Suncor's consolidated operating earnings for the second quarter of 2014 increased to $1.135 billion, compared to
$934 million for the prior year quarter, led by increased production at Oil Sands due to lower planned and unplanned
maintenance in the current year quarter compared to the prior year quarter, which included the impacts of the Upgrader
1 turnaround. Production in the current year quarter included the successful ramp up of Firebag, following the
commissioning of the hot bitumen infrastructure assets in the third quarter of 2013. The increased production allowed the
company to take advantage of a strong upstream pricing environment including the impacts of favourable foreign exchange
rates. These positive factors were partially offset by lower production volumes in Exploration and Production due to the
sale of the conventional natural gas business and having only negligible production in Libya due to continued political
unrest, as well as an increase in operating costs, including the impact of higher share-based compensation expense and
higher natural gas input costs.
12   SUNCOR ENERGY INC. 2014 SECOND QUARTER
Suncor's consolidated operating earnings were $2.928 billion for the first six months of 2014, compared to $2.301 billion for
the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to increased production at Oil Sands, which benefited from a stronger
upstream pricing environment and favourable foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower production in the Exploration
and Production segment due to the sale of the conventional natural gas business in 2013 and negligible production in Libya
due to ongoing political unrest, as well as an increase in operating costs, including the impacts of higher share-based
compensation expense and natural gas input costs.

3-2-1 crack spreads are indicators of the refining margin generated by converting three barrels of WTI into two barrels of gasoline and one barrel
of diesel. The crack spreads presented here generally approximate the regions into which the company sells refined products through retail and
wholesale channels.
SUNCOR ENERGY INC. 2014 SECOND QUARTER    13
Suncor's sweet SCO price realizations are influenced primarily by the price of WTI at Cushing and by the supply and
demand for sweet SCO from Western Canada. Price realizations in the second quarter of 2014 for sweet SCO were
positively impacted by a higher price for WTI of US$103.00/bbl, compared to US$94.20/bbl in the prior year quarter. Price
increases were driven by increased demand as refineries returned to service after planned spring maintenance and
increased takeaway capacity from Cushing to the U.S. Gulf Coast.
Suncor produces a specific grade of sour SCO, the price realizations for which are influenced by various crude
benchmarks including, but not limited to, MSW at Edmonton and WCS at Hardisty, and which can also be affected by
prices negotiated for spot sales. Prices for MSW at Edmonton and WCS at Hardisty increased in the second quarter of
2014 to $97.10/bbl and US$82.95/bbl, respectively, compared to $92.20/bbl and US$75.05/bbl, respectively, in the prior
year quarter, resulting in higher price realizations for sour SCO.
Bitumen production that Suncor does not upgrade is blended with diluent or SCO to facilitate delivery on pipeline systems.
Net bitumen price realizations are, therefore, influenced by both prices for Canadian heavy crude oil (WCS at Hardisty is a
common reference), prices for diluent (Condensate at Edmonton) and SCO. Bitumen price realizations can also be affected
by bitumen quality and spot sales. Average prices for WCS at Hardisty increased from US$75.05 in the prior year quarter
to US$82.95 in the current year quarter, while Condensate at Edmonton also increased, to a lesser extent, in the current
year quarter, resulting in higher price realizations for bitumen.
Suncor's price realizations for production from East Coast Canada and International assets are influenced primarily by the
price for Brent crude. Brent crude pricing increased over the prior year quarter and averaged US$109.75/bbl compared to
US$103.35/bbl in the prior year quarter.
Natural gas used in the company's Oil Sands and Refining operations and Suncor's price realizations for natural gas
production from Exploration and Production are primarily referenced to Alberta spot prices at AECO. The average AECO
benchmark increased to $4.65/mcf in the second quarter of 2014, from $3.50/mcf in the prior year quarter.
3-2-1 crack spreads are industry indicators approximating the gross margin on a barrel of crude oil that is refined to
produce gasoline and distillates, and by light/heavy and light/sour crude differentials. More complex refineries can earn
greater refining margins by processing less expensive, heavier crudes. Crack spreads do not necessarily reflect the
margins of a specific refinery. Crack spreads are based on current crude feedstock prices whereas actual refining margins
are based on first-in, first-out inventory accounting (FIFO), where a delay exists between the time that feedstock is
purchased and when it is processed and sold to a third party. Specific refinery margins are further impacted by actual
crude purchase costs, refinery configuration and refined products sales markets unique to that refinery. In the second
quarter of 2014, crack spreads declined, resulting in a negative impact to refining margins.
The majority of Suncor's revenues from the sale of oil and natural gas commodities is based on prices that are determined
by, or referenced to, U.S. dollar benchmark prices. The majority of Suncor's expenditures are realized in Canadian dollars.
An increase in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar will decrease revenue received from the sale of
commodities. A decrease in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar will increase the revenues received
from the sale of commodities.
In the second quarter of 2014, the Canadian dollar weakened in relation to the U.S. dollar as the average exchange rate
decreased to 0.92 from 0.98 in the prior year quarter, which had a positive impact on price realizations for the company
during the current year quarter.
Suncor also has assets and liabilities, notably most of the company's debt, which are denominated in U.S. dollars and
translated to Suncor's reporting currency (Canadian dollars) at each balance sheet date. A decrease in the value of the
Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar from the previous balance sheet date increases the amount of Canadian dollars
required to settle U.S. dollar denominated obligations.

Operating earnings for Oil Sands operations were $864 million, compared to $225 million in the prior year quarter. Operating
earnings increased primarily due to increased production at Oil Sands due to lower planned and unplanned maintenance in
the current year quarter compared to the prior year quarter, which included the impacts of the Upgrader 1 turnaround.
Production in the current year quarter included the successful ramp up of Firebag, following the commissioning of the hot
bitumen infrastructure assets. Current year price realizations increased consistent with the benchmarks and benefited from
the impacts of favourable exchange rates.
SUNCOR ENERGY INC. 2014 SECOND QUARTER    15
Operating earnings for Oil Sands ventures were $1 million, compared to $69 million in the prior year quarter, and decreased
primarily due to lower production and higher operating expenses related to planned and unplanned coker maintenance at
Syncrude, and higher DD&A expense at Syncrude due to a larger asset base resulting from assets commissioned in 2013.

Bitumen production from Oil Sands Base operations is upgraded, while bitumen production from In Situ operations is either upgraded or sold
directly to customers, including Suncor's own refineries. Yields of SCO and diesel from Suncor's upgrading process are approximately 79% of
bitumen feedstock input.
Production volumes for Oil Sands operations increased to 378,800 bbls/d in the second quarter of 2014, compared to
276,600 bbls/d in the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower planned and unplanned maintenance in the current year
quarter compared to the prior year quarter, which included the impacts of the Upgrader 1 turnaround and reduced rates at
upgrading due to unplanned third-party pipeline and cogeneration outages. Production in the current year was positively
impacted by the completion of the Firebag ramp up, partially offset by a planned six-week coker maintenance event,
unplanned maintenance events in upgrading and extraction, and a third-party pipeline outage which decreased takeaway
capacity. The third-party pipeline outage resulted in approximately 10,000 bbls/d of lost production for the quarter.
Suncor's share of Syncrude production decreased to 24,300 bbls/d in the second quarter of 2014 from 32,800 bbls/d in the
prior year quarter, due to a planned maintenance event that impacted the majority of the current year quarter in comparison
to a planned maintenance event which only partially impacted the prior year quarter. The current year quarter also included
the impacts of unplanned coker maintenance.

Oil Sands Base bitumen production from mining and extraction activities increased to an average of 256,100 bbls/d in the
second quarter of 2014 from 181,000 bbls/d in the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of mining output in the prior year
quarter being reduced to coincide with the Upgrader 1 turnaround.
16   SUNCOR ENERGY INC. 2014 SECOND QUARTER
In Situ bitumen production averaged 199,800 bbls/d in the second quarter of 2014, compared to 157,500 bbls/d in the prior
year quarter. The increase was primarily due to the completion of the Firebag ramp up and strong Firebag infill well
performance. MacKay River production of 27,400 bbls/d in the second quarter of 2014 was slightly below production of
28,200 bbls/d in the prior year quarter.

Average price realizations for sales from Oil Sands operations increased to $96.40/bbl in the second quarter of 2014 from
$84.14/bbl in the prior year quarter, due primarily to a more favourable sales mix, higher WTI benchmark prices and a
weaker Canadian dollar. In the second quarter of 2014, average price realizations for sweet SCO were negatively impacted
by price pressures resulting from a higher industry supply of sweet SCO volumes. Average price realizations for sour SCO
and bitumen increased in the second quarter of 2014 as compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher WCS
benchmark prices, as a result of increased demand as refineries returned from planned maintenance.
Royalties
Royalties for the Oil Sands segment were higher in the second quarter of 2014 than in the prior year quarter primarily due
to higher production volumes and bitumen prices.
Expenses and Other Factors
Operating and transportation expenses for the second quarter of 2014 were higher than the prior year quarter. See the Cash
Operating Costs Reconciliation section below for further details regarding cash operating costs and non-production costs.
Transportation expense for the second quarter of 2014 was higher than the prior year quarter, primarily due to
SUNCOR ENERGY INC. 2014 SECOND QUARTER    17
increased sales volumes, including incremental costs associated with higher diluent imports, increased pipeline access
and logistics infrastructure.
Operating expenses at Syncrude were higher in the second quarter of 2014 than in the prior year quarter, due primarily to
the planned maintenance event and the unplanned coker outage in the current year quarter, as well as higher natural gas
input costs.
DD&A expense for the second quarter of 2014 was higher than in the same period of 2013, due mainly to a larger asset
base as a result of Firebag well pads and associated hot bitumen infrastructure commissioned in the latter half of 2013 and
the Upgrader 1 turnaround in 2013.

Cash operating costs and cash operating costs per barrel are non-GAAP financial measures. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Advisory
section of this MD&A.
Significant non-production costs include, but are not limited to, share-based compensation adjustments, research, the expense recorded as part
of a non-monetary arrangement involving a third-party processor and feedstock costs for natural gas used to create hydrogen for secondary
upgrading processes.
Other includes the impacts of changes in inventory valuation and operating revenues associated with excess power from cogeneration units that
are deducted from total cash operating costs.
Cash operating costs per barrel for Oil Sands operations in the second quarter of 2014 decreased to an average of
$34.10/bbl compared to $46.55/bbl in the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher production volumes. Total cash
operating costs in the second quarter of 2014 remained flat with the prior year quarter despite the increased production
volumes. Total cash operating costs for the current year quarter included an increase in natural gas prices and
consumption, and lower net benefit from the sale of excess power due to decreased power prices, which were offset by
decreased maintenance and operating costs in mining.
Non-production costs, which are excluded from cash operating costs, increased in the second quarter of 2014 compared to
the prior year quarter primarily due to higher share-based compensation expense, higher feedstock costs impacting the
secondary upgrading process which resulted from the increased production volumes, and an increase in costs associated
with research and future growth activities.
Results for the First Six Months of 2014
Oil Sands segment operating earnings for the first six months of 2014 were $1.764 billion, compared to $747 million for the
same period in 2013. The increase was due primarily to higher production volumes in the current year period due to the
ramp up of Firebag following the commissioning of the hot bitumen infrastructure assets, compared to lower production
volumes in the prior year period which included the impacts of the Upgrader 1 turnaround and third-party outages. The
current year period was also impacted by higher average price realizations due to higher benchmark prices, and favourable
foreign exchange rates, partially offset by higher royalty expenses, DD&A expense and non-production costs including
share-based compensation expense.
Cash flow from operations for the first six months of 2014 was $3.014 billion for the segment, compared to $1.744 billion
for the same period in 2013. The increase in cash flow from operations was due primarily to higher production volumes and
higher average price realizations.
Cash operating costs per barrel for Oil Sands operations averaged $34.90/bbl for the first six months of 2014, a decrease
from an average of $39.95/bbl for the same period of 2013. The decrease was primarily due to higher production
18   SUNCOR ENERGY INC. 2014 SECOND QUARTER
volumes offset by higher cash operating costs which were driven by higher natural gas prices and consumption and a lower
net benefit from the sale of excess power due to decreased power prices.
Planned Maintenance
The company has a planned coker maintenance event at Upgrader 1 in the third and fourth quarters of 2014. The estimated
impact of this maintenance has been reflected in the company's 2014 guidance.

Exploration and Production operating earnings were $228 million in the second quarter of 2014, compared to $301 million in
the prior year quarter. Operating earnings of $105 million for E&P Canada decreased from $186 million in the prior year
quarter, primarily due to a decrease in sales volumes, as inventory levels were built up in the quarter compared to a
drawdown on inventory in the prior year quarter, and lower natural gas production in the current year quarter as a result of
the sale of the conventional natural gas business that closed in the third quarter of 2013. These factors were partially
offset by higher price realizations. Operating earnings of $123 million in the second quarter of 2014
SUNCOR ENERGY INC. 2014 SECOND QUARTER    19
for E&P International increased from $115 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher price realizations in the
U.K., partially offset by reduced production in Libya due to ongoing political unrest.

For E&P Canada, production averaged 60,100 boe/d in the second quarter of 2014, compared to 105,900 boe/d in the prior
year quarter, and decreased primarily due to the sale of the conventional natural gas business.
For E&P International, production averaged 55,200 boe/d in the second quarter of 2014, compared to 84,800 boe/d in the
prior year quarter, and decreased primarily due to production in Libya remaining substantially shut-in and planned
maintenance on a third-party gas plant that negatively impacted Buzzard production. The impacts of this maintenance
event were partially mitigated due to the successful implementation of a gas re-injection project.

In the second quarter of 2014, price realizations for crude oil from E&P Canada and E&P International were higher than the
prior year quarter, consistent with the increase in benchmark prices for Brent crude and favourable foreign exchange rates.
Price realizations for natural gas were higher, consistent with the increase in benchmark prices.
Royalties
Royalties for Exploration and Production were lower in the second quarter of 2014, compared with the prior year quarter,
due primarily to lower production in Libya and North America Onshore, partially offset by higher price realizations and
royalty rates in East Coast Canada.
Inventory
During the second quarter of 2014, there was an inventory build due to timing of shuttle tankers in East Coast Canada,
compared to an inventory draw in the prior year quarter.
20   SUNCOR ENERGY INC. 2014 SECOND QUARTER
Expenses and Other Factors
Operating and transportation expenses decreased in the second quarter of 2014 compared to the prior year quarter,
primarily due to the sale of the conventional natural gas business, negligible production in Libya, and lower costs
associated with lower sales volumes due to a build of inventory in East Coast Canada, partially offset by higher share-
based compensation expense.
DD&A and exploration expenses were lower in the second quarter of 2014 than in the prior year quarter, primarily due to
lower production in Libya and North America Onshore, and lower sales volumes in East Coast Canada due to the build in
inventory. Exploration expense was higher in the second quarter of 2014 than in the prior year quarter due to a charge for a
non-commercial exploration well in Norway as well as seismic purchases in Canada.
Financing Expense and Other Income included a gain in the current year quarter relating to a change in estimate of a
provision for future commitments of unutilized capacity on certain natural gas pipelines, and lower accretion expense in the
current year quarter due to the sale of the conventional natural gas business in the third quarter of 2013.
Other Items
Shelburne Farm-in Arrangement
During the quarter, the company signed a farm-in agreement with Shell Canada to acquire a 20% interest in a deepwater
exploration opportunity in the Shelburne Basin offshore Nova Scotia. Through this agreement, Suncor has committed to
participate in two exploration wells expected to be drilled commencing in the second half of 2015, pending regulatory
approval.
Results for the First Six Months of 2014
Operating earnings for Exploration and Production for the first six months of 2014 were $522 million, compared to
$655 million for the prior year period. Operating earnings were lower primarily due to negligible production in Libya due to
ongoing political unrest and the sale of the conventional natural gas business in the third quarter of 2013. These factors
were partially offset by higher price realizations in the second quarter of 2014, consistent with the increase in benchmark
prices for Brent crude, and favourable foreign exchange rates in both the first and second quarters of 2014.
Cash flow from operations was $1.129 billion for the first six months of 2014, compared to $1.358 billion for the prior year
period, and decreased primarily due to the same factors that impacted operating earnings.
Planned Maintenance
A planned four-week maintenance event at Terra Nova has been scheduled for the third quarter of 2014. Planned
maintenance has also been scheduled for White Rose and Buzzard in the third quarter of 2014. The estimated impact of
this maintenance has been reflected in the company's 2014 guidance.

Refining and Marketing reported operating earnings of $306 million in the second quarter of 2014, compared to $432 million
in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower throughput volumes resulting from planned maintenance
at the Edmonton and Montreal refineries, an increase in operating expenses, including the impacts of higher share-based
compensation expense, and DD&A expense. Refinery margins were negatively impacted by lower benchmark crack
spreads partially offset by favourable inland crude price differentials, strong refining margins in Western North America
relative to the benchmarks, and improved crude differentials at the Montreal refinery due to increased rail shipments of
lower priced inland crudes.
Marketing activities contributed $49 million to operating earnings in the second quarter of 2014, compared to $77 million in
the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily due to higher DD&A expense related to the impacts of cancelling certain
projects, higher share-based compensation expense and higher marketing expenses.

Effective January 1, 2014, the company increased the nameplate capacity of the Edmonton refinery from 140,000 bbls/d to 142,000 bbls/d. Prior
quarter utilization rates have not been recalculated and reflect the lower nameplate capacity.
Refinery utilization is the amount of crude oil and natural gas plant liquids run through crude distillation units, expressed as a percentage of the
capacity of these units.
Refinery crude throughput decreased in the second quarter of 2014, resulting in an average refinery utilization of 85%,
compared to 90% in the prior year quarter. In Eastern North America, the average crude oil processed decreased to
185,500 bbls/d in the second quarter of 2014 from 212,100 bbls/d in the prior year quarter due to a five-week planned
maintenance event at the Montreal refinery. The average crude oil processed in Western North America increased to
205,600 bbls/d in the second quarter of 2014 from 202,400 bbls/d in the prior year quarter, despite a seven-week planned
maintenance event at the Edmonton refinery in the current year quarter compared to a four-week planned maintenance
event in the prior year quarter.
Total sales decreased slightly to 515,900 bbls/d in the second quarter of 2014, compared to 532,100 bbls/d in the prior
year quarter, primarily due to lower throughput volumes and the expiration of certain term supply contracts.
Prices and Margins
For Refining and Supply, refined product margins were lower in the second quarter of 2014 than in the prior year quarter
and were impacted primarily by the following factors:
•
•
•
(1)
The narrowing differential between Brent and WTI was reflected in lower benchmark crack spreads for the second
quarter of 2014 and had a negative impact on refining margins. Benchmark crack spreads were lower across all
regions into which the company sells refined product compared to the prior year quarter; however, this was partially
offset by the impact of the weakening Canadian dollar and strong refining margins in Western North America relative
to the benchmarks.
In the second quarter of 2014, the impact of the FIFO method of inventory valuation, as used by the company,
relative to an estimated LIFO(1) method, had a negative impact to net earnings of approximately $15 million after-
tax, compared to a positive impact to net earnings of $4 million in the prior year quarter.
Slightly higher light/heavy crude differentials for inland crudes positively impacted refining margins, which were
further complemented by the full ramp up of rail shipments to the Montreal refinery enabling Suncor to take
advantage of price differentials between inland and Brent crudes. Crude by rail shipments averaged 36,000 bbls/d in
the second quarter.
LIFO is a Non-GAAP financial measure. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Advisory section of this MD&A.
SUNCOR ENERGY INC. 2014 SECOND QUARTER    23
Marketing margins from the second quarter of 2014 were higher than margins in the prior year quarter, due primarily to
higher retail and wholesale margins partially offset by lower lubricant margins.
Expenses and Other Factors
Operating and transportation expenses were higher in the second quarter of 2014 compared to the prior year quarter,
primarily due to increased share-based compensation expense, higher energy input costs and higher maintenance costs.
DD&A expense increased in the second quarter of 2014 due to asset additions since the prior year quarter, including costs
associated with planned maintenance events in 2013, in addition to an impairment of previously capitalized costs related to
the construction of a sulphur recovery plant that is no longer required after the acquisition of an existing facility subsequent
to the end of the current year quarter.
Results for the First Six Months of 2014
For the first six months of 2014, Refining and Marketing segment operating earnings were $1.093 billion, compared to
operating earnings of $1.214 billion for the prior year period. The decrease in earnings was due primarily to increased
operating expenses, including higher share-based compensation expense and higher energy input costs, lower benchmark
crack spreads across all regions into which the company sells refined products and lower throughput volume resulting from
maintenance at the Montreal and Commerce City refineries, partially offset by the positive impact of the weakening
Canadian dollar. The impact on earnings relating to the increasing crude price environment increased after-tax earnings by
approximately $185 million for the first six months of 2014 compared to $121 million for the prior year period.
Cash flow from operations was $1.435 billion for the first six months of 2014, compared to $1.713 billion for the prior year
period, and decreased primarily due to the same factors that influenced operating earnings.
Planned Maintenance
The Edmonton refinery has a four-week planned maintenance event in the third quarter of 2014, the Montreal refinery has
an eleven-week planned maintenance event beginning late in the third quarter of 2014 and the Sarnia refinery has an eight-
week planned maintenance event beginning in the third quarter of 2014. The estimated impact of this maintenance has
been reflected in the company's 2014 guidance.

Renewable Energy operating earnings increased to $24 million in the second quarter of 2014 from $21 million in the prior
year quarter, due primarily to stronger margins in the ethanol business driven by lower feedstock costs, partially offset by
lower wind power production and lower power prices.
Energy Trading
Energy Trading had an operating loss of $6 million in the quarter, compared to operating earnings of $16 million in the prior
year quarter, primarily due to narrowing price differentials which reduced trading results in all key strategies. Energy
Trading had an increase in cash flow used in operations, due primarily to the settlement of trading obligations in the
current year.
Corporate
The Corporate operating loss was $280 million for the second quarter of 2014, compared with an operating loss of
$174 million for the prior year period. The increase in operating loss was primarily due to higher share-based compensation
expense and foreign exchange losses on working capital and inter-company balances. The company capitalized
$113 million of its borrowing costs in the second quarter of 2014 as part of the cost of major development assets and
construction projects, compared to $104 million in the prior year quarter.
Eliminations
Eliminations reflect the elimination of profit on crude oil sales from Oil Sands and East Coast Canada to Refining and
Product Supply. Consolidated profits are only realized when the refined products produced from internal purchases of crude
feedstock have been sold to third parties. During the second quarter of 2014, the company eliminated $2 million of after-tax
intersegment profit, compared to $44 million of profit that was recognized in the prior year quarter.
Results for the First Six Months of 2014
The operating loss for Corporate, Energy Trading and Eliminations for the first six months of 2014 was $451 million,
compared to an operating loss of $315 million for the prior year period. The higher operating loss was due primarily to
higher share-based compensation expense due to the increase in Suncor's share price and a larger after-tax profit that was
eliminated on the internal transfer of crude feedstock in the first six months of 2014, compared to the prior year period. The
company capitalized $221 million of its borrowing costs in the first six months of 2014 as part of the cost of major
development assets and construction projects, comparable with the $200 million capitalized in the prior year period.

Capital expenditures in this table exclude capitalized interest on debt.
Growth capital expenditures include capital investments that result in i) an increase in production levels at existing Oil Sands operations and
Refining and Marketing operations; ii) new facilities or operations that increase overall production; iii) new infrastructure that is required to support
higher production levels; iv) new reserves or a positive change in the company's reserves profile in Exploration and Production operations; or
v) margin improvement, by increasing revenues or reducing costs.
Sustaining capital expenditures include capital investments that i) ensure compliance or maintain relations with regulators and other stakeholders;
ii) improve efficiency and reliability of operations or maintain productive capacity by replacing component assets at the end of their useful lives;
iii) deliver existing proved developed reserves for Exploration and Production operations; or iv) maintain current production capacities at existing
Oil Sands operations and Refining and Marketing operations.
In the second quarter of 2014, total capital and exploration expenditures were $1.650 billion (excluding capitalized interest).
Activity in the second quarter of 2014 included the following:
Oil Sands
Oil Sands Base
Oil Sands Base capital and exploration expenditures were $297 million in the second quarter of 2014, of which $251 million
and $46 million, respectively, were directed towards sustaining and growth activities. The company continued to progress
reliability and sustainment projects, including the construction of assets to support the tailings management process and
activities aimed at reducing freshwater use, including the construction of a water treatment plant that was commissioned
during the quarter. Capital expenditures also included expenditures associated with the planned coker maintenance at
Upgrader 2.
26   SUNCOR ENERGY INC. 2014 SECOND QUARTER
In Situ
In Situ capital and exploration expenditures were $222 million, of which $45 million was directed towards growth projects.
During the quarter, the company achieved first steam on the well pads associated with the MacKay River facility
debottlenecking project. The project is intended to increase production capacity by approximately 20% for total capacity of
38,000 bbls/d by the end of 2015. First oil from this project is expected in the third quarter of 2014. Growth capital
expenditures also included activities related to a potential sanction decision of the MacKay River expansion project
in 2014.
Sustaining capital expenditures of $177 million were directed towards ongoing design, engineering, procurement and
construction of new well pads that are expected to maintain existing production levels at Firebag and MacKay River in
future years. Capital expenditures were also directed towards the infill well program at Firebag.
Oil Sands Ventures
Oil Sands ventures capital and exploration expenditures were $390 million, of which $299 million was directed to growth
capital and $91 million to sustaining capital. Growth capital expenditures reflected a ramp up of spending for the Fort Hills
project and continued to focus on detailed engineering, procurement of long-lead items and ramp up of field construction
activities. Detailed engineering work was approximately 40% complete by the end of the second quarter. Key construction
activities during the quarter included foundation concrete pours and the start of construction of primary extraction
separation cells.
Suncor's share of capital expenditures for the Syncrude joint venture was $91 million, which included expenditures for the
mine train replacement at the Mildred Lake mining area, the construction of a centrifuge plant for tailings management and
expenditures associated with planned coker maintenance.
Exploration and Production
Exploration and Production incurred $428 million in capital and exploration expenditures in the second quarter of 2014. At
the Golden Eagle project, spending was related primarily to ongoing development drilling activities and the successful
installation of key offshore facilities where first oil is anticipated in late 2014 or early 2015. Expenditures for the Hebron
project related to detailed engineering and construction of the gravity-based structure and topsides. The project is expected
to achieve first oil in 2017. Growth spending also included development drilling activities at the Hibernia Southern
Extension Unit and spending associated with the second phase of the South White Rose Extension project, which is
expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2014. The Hibernia Southern Extension Unit and South White Rose
Extension projects are expected to increase overall production starting in 2015 and extend the productive life of the
existing fields. A funding decision for further development of the Ben Nevis-Avalon reservoir at Hibernia is expected in the
third quarter of 2014. Activities to prepare for a sanction decision for further expansion into the West White Rose field are
ongoing with a sanction decision targeted for late 2014.
Refining and Marketing
Capital expenditures of $244 million related primarily to the ongoing sustainment of operations and planned maintenance
activities at the Montreal and Edmonton refineries. Growth spending in the Refining and Marketing segment continues to
focus on preparing the Montreal refinery to receive more inland crudes, and ongoing work on a project at the refinery to
modify the hydrocracking unit.

Cash flow from operations plus current income taxes and interest expense, divided by the sum of interest expense and capitalized interest

Capital Resources
Suncor's capital resources consist primarily of cash flow from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and available lines
of credit. Suncor's management believes the company will have the capital resources to fund the remainder of its planned
2014 capital spending program and meet current and future working capital requirements through existing cash balances
and short-term investments, cash flow from operations for the remainder of 2014, available committed credit facilities, and
issuing commercial paper and/or long-term notes or debentures. The company's cash flow from operations depends on a
number of factors, including commodity prices, production and sales volumes, refining and marketing margins, operating
expenses, taxes, royalties and foreign exchange rates. If additional capital is required, Suncor's management believes
adequate additional financing will be available in debt capital markets at commercial terms and rates.
The company has invested excess cash in short-term financial instruments that are presented as cash and cash
equivalents. The objectives of the company's short-term investment portfolio are to ensure the preservation of capital,
maintain adequate liquidity to meet Suncor's cash flow requirements and deliver competitive returns consistent with the
quality and diversification of investments within acceptable risk parameters. The maximum weighted average term to
maturity of the short-term investment portfolio is not expected to exceed six months, and all investments are with
counterparties with investment grade debt ratings.
Available Sources of Liquidity
Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $4.932 billion during the first six months of 2014 from $5.202 billion at
December 31, 2013, due primarily to capital and exploration expenditures, changes in non-cash working capital, share
repurchases, and dividends that exceeded cash flow from operations.
As at June 30, 2014, the weighted average term to maturity of the short-term investment portfolio was approximately
32 days.
Financing Activities
Management of debt levels continues to be a priority for Suncor given the company's long-term growth plans. Suncor's
management believes a phased and flexible approach to existing and future growth projects should assist Suncor in
maintaining its ability to manage project costs and debt levels.
Unutilized lines of credit at June 30, 2014 were $4.425 billion, compared to $4.536 billion at December 31, 2013.

Total Debt to Total Debt Plus Shareholders' Equity
Suncor is subject to financial and operating covenants related to its bank debt and public market debt. Failure to meet the
terms of one or more of these covenants may constitute an Event of Default as defined in the respective debt agreements,
potentially resulting in accelerated repayment of one or more of the debt obligations. The company is in compliance with its
financial covenant that requires total debt to not exceed 65% of its total debt plus shareholders' equity. At June 30, 2014,
total debt to total debt plus shareholders' equity was 22% (December 31, 2013 – 22%). The company is also currently in
compliance with all operating covenants.

At June 30, 2014, Suncor's net debt was $6.542 billion, compared to $6.256 billion at December 31, 2013. Over the first six
months of 2014, net debt increased by $286 million, largely driven by an increase in working capital primarily due to
income tax and royalty payments, share repurchases and dividends, partially offset by cash flow from operations that
exceeded capital and exploration expenditures.
For the twelve months ended June 30, 2014, the company's net debt to cash flow from operations measure was 0.6 times,
which met management's target of less than 2.0 times.

On February 21, 2014, Suncor amended its Normal Course Issuer Bid (the 2013 NCIB) that commenced on August 5, 2013
to allow for an additional $1.0 billion worth of its common shares to be repurchased. Pursuant to the 2013 NCIB, Suncor is
permitted to purchase for cancellation a total of approximately $2.8 billion worth of its common shares between August 5,
2013 and August 4, 2014. In the second quarter of 2014, the company repurchased 6,465,500 common shares under the
NCIB at an average price of $41.96 per share, for a total repurchase cost of $271 million.
Subsequent to the second quarter, and as at July 23, 2014, the company had repurchased an additional
2,829,500 common shares under the 2013 NCIB at an average price of $45.00 per share, for a total repurchase cost of
$127 million.

intention to renew its normal course issuer bid (the 2014 NCIB) to continue to purchase shares under its previously
announced buyback program through the facilities of the TSX, New York Stock Exchange and/or alternative trading
platforms. The notice provides that Suncor may purchase for cancellation up to approximately $1.1 billion worth of its
common shares beginning August 5, 2014 and ending August 4, 2015. Pursuant to the 2014 NCIB, Suncor has agreed that
it will not purchase more than 44,045,388 common shares, which is equal to approximately 3% of Suncor's issued and
outstanding common shares.

Contractual Obligations, Commitments, Guarantees, and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the normal course of business, the company is obligated to make future payments, including contractual obligations and
non-cancellable commitments. Suncor has included these items in the Financial Condition and Liquidity section of its 2013
annual MD&A, which section is herein incorporated by reference. The company does not believe that it has any guarantees
or off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on the
company's financial performance or financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures. During the
six months ended June 30, 2014, Suncor increased its commitments by approximately $1.1 billion in exploratory drilling
commitments and commitments in support of the company's market access strategy, including activities to expand its
storage and logistics network. The contract terms for the majority of these commitments range between two and ten years,
with payments commencing as early as the fourth quarter of 2014.
30   SUNCOR ENERGY INC. 2014 SECOND QUARTER
7. QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA
Trends in Suncor's quarterly earnings and cash flow from operations are driven primarily by production volumes, which can
be significantly impacted by major maintenance events – such as the maintenance that occurred in Oil Sands and Refining
and Marketing in the second and third quarters of 2013 and at many Exploration and Production assets in the third quarter
of 2012 – and unplanned maintenance outages, such as the one that occurred at Upgrader 2 in the second quarter of 2013.
Trends in Suncor's quarterly earnings and cash flow from operations are also affected by changes in commodity prices,
refining crack spreads and foreign exchange rates.

wholesale channels.
Significant or Unusual Items Impacting Net Earnings
In addition to the impacts of changes in production volumes and business environment, net earnings over the last eight
quarters were affected by the following events or one-time adjustments:
•
The second quarter of 2014 included an after-tax impairment charge of $718 million in the Oil Sands segment
against the company's interest in the Joslyn mining project. Total E&P, the operator of the Joslyn mining project,
together with Suncor and the other co-owners of the project, agreed to scale back certain development activities in
order to focus on engineering studies to further optimize the Joslyn project development plan.
The second quarter of 2014 included an after-tax impairment charge of $297 million in the Exploration and
Production segment against the company's Libyan assets. As a result of the continued closure of certain Libyan
export terminals during the quarter and the company's latest view on production plans during the remaining term of
the production sharing agreements, the company has recorded an after-tax impairment charge of $297 million
against its assets in Libya.
The second quarter of 2014 included after-tax impairment charges of $223 million in Oil Sands following a review of
certain assets that no longer fit with Suncor's previously revised growth strategies and which could not be
repurposed or otherwise deployed.
The second quarter of 2014 included after-tax earnings of $32 million related to a reserves redetermination of
1.2 million barrels of oil related to an interest in a Norwegian asset that Suncor previously owned.
The fourth quarter of 2013 included after-tax impairment charges of $563 million in the Exploration and Production
segment against assets in Syria, Libya and North America Onshore. Concurrent with the impairment of the Syrian
assets, the company recognized after-tax risk mitigation proceeds of $223 million, previously recorded as a long-
term provision.
•
•
•
•
•
The first and fourth quarters of 2013 included a net after-tax charge of $58 million as a result of not proceeding with
the Voyageur upgrader project, which included costs related to decommissioning and restoration of the Voyageur
site and contract cancellations.
32   SUNCOR ENERGY INC. 2014 SECOND QUARTER
•
•
•
•
The third quarter of 2013 included an after-tax gain of $130 million relating to the sale of the company's conventional
natural gas business.
The fourth quarter of 2012 included an after-tax impairment charge of $1.487 billion relating to the Voyageur
upgrader project. Given Suncor's view at the time of the challenging economic environment, the company performed
an impairment test based on an assessment of expected future net cash flows.
The fourth quarter of 2012 included an after-tax impairment reversal of $177 million of the impairment charges
recorded against the company's assets in Syria in the second quarter of 2012, due to a revised assessment of the
net recoverable value of the underlying assets following the receipt of risk mitigation proceeds.
The fourth quarter of 2012 included total after-tax impairment charges of $172 million for certain exploration,
development and production assets in the Exploration and Production segment, and a provision in North America
Onshore for estimated future commitments relating to unutilized pipeline capacity.
8. OTHER ITEMS
Accounting Policies
Suncor's significant accounting policies and a summary of recently announced accounting standards are described in
notes 3 and 5, respectively, to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2013.
Adoption of New Accounting Standards
Effective January 1, 2014, the company retrospectively adopted International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee
(IFRIC) 21 Levies which clarifies that an entity recognizes a liability for a levy when the activity that triggers payment, as
identified by the relevant legislation, occurs. It also clarifies that a levy liability is accrued progressively only if the activity
that triggers payment occurs over a period of time, and that a liability should not be recognized before the specified
minimum threshold to trigger that liability is reached. The adoption of this interpretation did not have an impact to the
company's condensed interim Consolidated Financial Statements.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments
and assumptions that affect reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, gains and losses, and disclosures of
contingencies. These estimates and assumptions are subject to change based on experience and new information. Critical
accounting estimates are those that require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at
the time the estimate is made. Critical accounting estimates are also those estimates which, where a different estimate
could have been used or where changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material impact
on the company's financial condition, changes in financial condition or financial performance. Critical accounting estimates
and judgments are reviewed annually by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. A detailed description of Suncor's
critical accounting estimates is provided in note 4 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended
December 31, 2013 and in the Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates section of Suncor's 2013
annual MD&A.
Financial Instruments
Suncor periodically enters into derivative contracts such as forwards, futures, swaps, options and costless collars to
manage exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and foreign exchange rates, and to optimize the company's position
with respect to interest payments. The company also uses physical and financial energy derivatives to earn trading profits.
For more information on Suncor's financial instruments and the related financial risk factors, see note 27 of the audited
Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2013, note 11 to the unaudited interim Consolidated
Financial Statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, and in the Financial Condition and Liquidity
section of Suncor's 2013 annual MD&A.
Canada Revenue Agency Update
Pursuant to the previously disclosed 2013 proposal letter from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), the company received
a Notice of Reassessment (NOR) from the CRA during the second quarter of 2014, regarding the income tax treatment of
realized losses in 2007 on the settlement of certain derivative contracts. The total amount of the NOR, including tax,
SUNCOR ENERGY INC. 2014 SECOND QUARTER    33
penalty and interest, was approximately $920 million. The company strongly disagrees with the CRA's position and
continues to firmly believe it will be able to successfully defend its original filing position and will take the appropriate
actions to resolve this matter.
The company has provided security to the CRA for $460 million (50% of the NOR amount).
The company also expects to receive NORs from certain provincial tax authorities related to this matter for approximately
$280 million in the second half of 2014.
If the company is unsuccessful in defending its tax filing position, it could be subject to an earnings and cash impact of up
to $1.2 billion.
Control Environment
Based on their evaluation as at June 30, 2014, Suncor's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that
the company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the United States
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), are effective to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by the company in reports that are filed or submitted to Canadian and U.S. securities authorities is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Canadian and U.S. securities laws. In addition, as
at June 30, 2014, there were no changes in the internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that occurred during the three-month period ended June 30, 2014 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the company's internal control over financial reporting. Management
will continue to periodically evaluate the company's disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting and will make any modifications from time to time as deemed necessary.
As a result of current events in Syria, Suncor is not able to monitor the status of all of its assets in the country, including
whether certain facilities have suffered damages. Suncor has assessed and is continually monitoring the control
environment in the country and does not consider the changes to have a material impact on the company's overall internal
control over financial reporting.
Based on their inherent limitations, disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements, and even those controls determined to be effective can provide only reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
Corporate Guidance
Suncor has updated its previously issued 2014 corporate guidance. Suncor's press release dated July 30, 2014, which is
also available on www.sedar.com, provides this update to its corporate guidance as well as new assumptions around
oil pricing.

9. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ADVISORY
Certain financial measures in this MD&A – namely operating earnings, ROCE, cash flow from operations, Oil Sands cash
operating costs and LIFO – are not prescribed by GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are included because
management uses the information to analyze operating performance, leverage and liquidity. These non-GAAP financial
measures do not have any standardized meaning and, therefore, are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures
presented by other companies. Therefore, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as
a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Except as otherwise indicated, these non-
GAAP measures are calculated and disclosed on a consistent basis from period to period. Specific adjusting items may
only be relevant in certain periods.
Operating Earnings
Operating earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts net earnings for significant items that are not indicative
of operating performance. Management uses operating earnings to evaluate operating performance because management
believes it provides better comparability between periods. Operating earnings are reconciled to net earnings in the
Consolidated Financial Information section of this document.
Bridge Analyses of Operating Earnings
Throughout this MD&A, the company presents charts that illustrate the change in operating earnings from the comparative
period through key variance factors. These factors are analyzed in the Operating Earnings narratives following the bridge
analyses in particular sections of the MD&A. These bridge analyses are presented because management uses this
presentation to evaluate performance.
•
•
•
•
The factor for Volumes and Mix is calculated based on production volumes and mix for the Oil Sands and
Exploration and Production segments and throughput volumes and mix for the Refining and Marketing segment.
The factor for Price, Margin and Other Revenue includes upstream price realizations before royalties, refining and
marketing margins, other operating revenues, and the net impacts of sales and purchases of third-party crude,
including product purchased for use as diluent in the company's Oil Sands operations and subsequently sold as part
of diluted bitumen.
The factor for Royalties includes royalties in Libya that represent the difference between gross revenues, which is
based on the company's working-interest share of production, and the net revenue attributable to Suncor under the
terms of the respective contracts.
The factor for Inventory reflects the opportunity cost of building production volumes in inventory or the additional
margin earned by drawing down inventory produced in previous periods. The calculation of the Inventory factor in a
bridge analysis permits the company to present the factor for Volumes and Mix based on production volumes,
rather than based on sales volumes.
The factor for Operating and Transportation Expense includes project start-up costs, operating, selling and general
expense (adjusted for impacts of changes in inventory), and transportation expense.
•
•
The factor for Financing Expense and Other Income includes financing expenses, other income, operational foreign
exchange gains and losses, changes in gains and losses on disposal of assets that are not operating earnings
adjustments, changes in statutory income tax rates, and other income tax adjustments.
Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)
ROCE is a non-GAAP financial measure that management uses to analyze operating performance and the efficiency of
Suncor's capital allocation process. Average capital employed is calculated as a twelve-month average of the capital
employed balance at the beginning of the twelve-month period and the month-end capital employed balances throughout
the remainder of the twelve-month period. Figures for capital employed at the beginning and end of the twelve-month period
are presented to show the changes in the components of the calculation over the twelve-month period.
The company presents two ROCE calculations – one including and one excluding the impacts on capital employed of
major projects in progress. Major projects in progress includes accumulated capital expenditures and capitalized interest
for significant projects still under construction or in the process of being commissioned, and acquired assets that are still
SUNCOR ENERGY INC. 2014 SECOND QUARTER    35
being evaluated. Management uses ROCE excluding the impacts of major projects in progress on capital employed to
assess performance of operating assets.

Cash Flow from Operations
Cash flow from operations is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts a GAAP measure – cash flow provided by
operating activities – for changes in non-cash working capital, which management uses to analyze operating performance
and liquidity. Changes to non-cash working capital can include, among other factors, the timing of offshore feedstock
purchases and payments for fuel and income taxes, which management believes reduces comparability between periods.
Cash flow from operations in this MD&A for the twelve-month ended periods are the sum of the cash flow from operations
for the particular quarter ended June 30 and each of the three preceding quarters, each separately defined and reconciled
to GAAP measures in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Advisory section of each respective MD&A for the applicable
quarter.

Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated by deducting capital and exploration expenditures for
the twelve-month period from cash flow from operations for the same period. Free cash flow reflects cash available for
distribution to shareholders and to fund financing activities. Management uses free cash flow to measure financial
performance and liquidity.

Oil Sands cash operating costs and cash operating costs per barrel are non-GAAP financial measures, which are
calculated by adjusting Oil Sands segment operating, selling and general expense (a GAAP measure based on sales
volumes) for i) costs pertaining to Syncrude operations; ii) non-production costs that management believes do not relate to
the production performance of Oil Sands operations, including, but not limited to, share-based compensation adjustments,
research, the expense recorded as part of a non-monetary arrangement involving a third-party processor, and feedstock
costs for natural gas used to create hydrogen for secondary upgrading processes; iii) excess power generated and sold
that is recorded in operating revenue; and iv) the impacts of changes in inventory levels, such that the company is able to
present cost information based on production volumes. Oil Sands cash operating costs are reconciled in the Segment
Results and Analysis – Oil Sands section of the MD&A.
38   SUNCOR ENERGY INC. 2014 SECOND QUARTER
Impact of First-in, First-out Inventory Valuation on Refining and Marketing Net Earnings
GAAP requires the use of a FIFO inventory valuation methodology. For Suncor, this results in a disconnect between the
sales prices for refined products, which reflects current market conditions, and the amount recorded as the cost of sale for
the related refinery feedstock, which reflect market conditions at the time when the feedstock was purchased. This lag
between purchase and sale can be anywhere from several weeks to several months, and is influenced by the time to
receive crude after purchase (which can be several weeks for foreign offshore crude purchases), regional crude inventory
levels, the completion of refining processes, transportation time to distribution channels, and regional refined product
inventory levels.
Suncor prepares and presents an estimate of the impact of using a FIFO inventory valuation methodology compared to a
LIFO methodology, because management uses the information to analyze operating performance and compare itself
against refining peers that are permitted to use LIFO inventory valuation under United States GAAP (U.S. GAAP).
The company's estimate is not derived from a standardized calculation and, therefore, may not be directly comparable to
similar measures presented by other companies, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures
of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP or U.S. GAAP.

Forward-looking statements and information are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and
uncertainties, some that are similar to other oil and gas companies and some that are unique to Suncor. Suncor's actual
results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by its forward-looking statements, so readers are cautioned
not to place undue reliance on them.
The financial and operating performance of the company's reportable operating segments, specifically Oil Sands,
Exploration and Production, and Refining and Marketing, may be affected by a number of factors.
Factors that affect our Oil Sands segment include, but are not limited to, volatility in the prices for crude oil and other
production, and the related impacts of fluctuating light/heavy and sweet/sour crude oil differentials; changes in the demand
for refinery feedstock and diesel fuel, including the possibility that refiners that process our proprietary production will be
closed, experience equipment failure or other accidents; our ability to operate our Oil Sands facilities reliably in order to
meet production targets; the output of newly commissioned facilities, the performance of which may be difficult to predict
during initial operations; the possibility that completed maintenance activities may not improve operational performance or
the output of related facilities; our dependence on pipeline capacity and other logistical constraints, which may affect our
ability to distribute our products to market; our ability to finance Oil Sands growth and sustaining capital expenditures; the
availability of bitumen feedstock for upgrading operations, which can be negatively affected by poor ore grade quality,
unplanned mine equipment and extraction plant maintenance, tailings storage, and in situ reservoir and equipment
performance, or the unavailability of third-party bitumen; inflationary pressures on operating costs, including labour, natural
gas and other energy sources used in oil sands processes; our ability to complete projects, including planned maintenance
events, both on time and on budget, which could be impacted by competition from other projects (including other oil sands
projects) for goods and services and demands on infrastructure in Alberta's Wood Buffalo region and the surrounding area
(including housing, roads and schools); risks and uncertainties associated with obtaining regulatory and stakeholder
approval for exploration and development activities; changes to royalty and tax
SUNCOR ENERGY INC. 2014 SECOND QUARTER    41
legislation and related agreements that could impact our business; the potential for disruptions to operations and
construction projects as a result of our relationships with labour unions that represent employees at our facilities; and
changes to environmental regulations or legislation.
Factors that affect our Exploration and Production segment include, but are not limited to, volatility in crude oil and natural
gas prices; operational risks and uncertainties associated with oil and gas activities, including unexpected formations or
pressures, premature declines of reservoirs, fires, blow-outs, equipment failures and other accidents, uncontrollable flows
of crude oil, natural gas or well fluids, and pollution and other environmental risks; the possibility that completed
maintenance activities may not improve operational performance or the output of related facilities; adverse weather
conditions, which could disrupt output from producing assets or impact drilling programs, resulting in increased costs
and/or delays in bringing on new production; political, economic and socio-economic risks associated with Suncor's foreign
operations, including the unpredictability of operating in Libya due to ongoing political unrest and that operations in Syria
continue to be impacted by sanctions and political unrest; risks and uncertainties associated with obtaining regulatory and
stakeholder approval for exploration and development activities; the potential for disruptions to operations and construction
projects as a result of our relationships with labour unions that represent employees at our facilities; and market demand
for mineral rights and producing properties, potentially leading to losses on disposition or increased property acquisition
costs.
Factors that affect our Refining and Marketing segment include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in demand and supply
for refined products that impact the company's margins; market competition, including potential new market entrants; our
ability to reliably operate refining and marketing facilities in order to meet production or sales targets; the possibility that
completed maintenance activities may not improve operational performance or the output of related facilities; risks and
uncertainties affecting construction or planned maintenance schedules, including the availability of labour and other
impacts of competing projects drawing on the same resources during the same time period; and the potential for
disruptions to operations and construction projects as a result of our relationships with labour unions or employee
associations that represent employees at our refineries and distribution facilities.
Additional risks, uncertainties and other factors that could influence the financial and operating performance of all of
Suncor's operating segments and activities include, but are not limited to, changes in general economic, market and
business conditions, such as commodity prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates; fluctuations in supply and
demand for Suncor's products; the successful and timely implementation of capital projects, including growth projects and
regulatory projects; competitive actions of other companies, including increased competition from other oil and gas
companies or from companies that provide alternative sources of energy; labour and material shortages; actions by
government authorities, including the imposition or reassessment of taxes or changes to fees and royalties, such as the
Notice of Reassessment received by Suncor from the Canada Revenue Agency, relating to the settlement of certain
derivative contracts, including the risk that: (i) Suncor may not be able to successfully defend its original filing position and
ultimately be required to pay increased taxes, interest and penalty as a result; or (ii) Suncor may be required to post cash
instead of security in relation to the Notice of Reassessment; changes in environmental and other regulations; the ability
and willingness of parties with whom we have material relationships to perform their obligations to us; outages to third-party
infrastructure that could cause disruptions to production; the occurrence of unexpected events such as fires, equipment
failures and other similar events affecting Suncor or other parties whose operations or assets directly or indirectly affect
Suncor; the potential for security breaches of Suncor's information systems by computer hackers or cyberterrorists, and
the unavailability or failure of such systems to perform as anticipated as a result of such breaches; our ability to find new
oil and gas reserves that can be developed economically; the accuracy of Suncor's reserves, resources and future
production estimates; market instability affecting Suncor's ability to borrow in the capital debt markets at acceptable rates;
maintaining an optimal debt to cash flow ratio; the success of the company's risk management activities using derivatives
and other financial instruments; the cost of compliance with current and future environmental laws; risks and uncertainties
associated with closing a transaction for the purchase or sale of an oil and gas property, including estimates of the final
consideration to be paid or received, the ability of counterparties to comply with their obligations in a timely manner and the
receipt of any required regulatory or other third-party approvals outside of Suncor's control that are customary to
transactions of this nature; and the accuracy of cost estimates, some of which are provided at the conceptual or other
preliminary stage of projects and prior to commencement or conception of the detailed engineering that is needed to reduce
the margin of error and increase the level of accuracy. The foregoing important factors are not exhaustive.
Many of these risk factors and other assumptions related to Suncor's forward-looking statements and information are
discussed in further detail throughout this MD&A, including under the heading Risk Factors, and the company's 2013 AIF
dated February 28, 2014 and Form 40-F on file with Canadian securities commissions at www.sedar.com and the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov. Readers are also referred to the risk factors and
assumptions described in other documents that Suncor files from time to time with securities regulatory authorities. Copies
of these documents are available without charge from the company.

46   SUNCOR ENERGY INC. 2014 SECOND QUARTER
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(unaudited)
1. REPORTING ENTITY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS
Suncor Energy Inc. (Suncor or the company) is an integrated energy company headquartered in Canada. Suncor's
operations include oil sands development and upgrading, onshore and offshore oil and gas production, petroleum refining,
and product marketing primarily under the Petro-Canada brand. The consolidated financial statements of the company
comprise the company and its subsidiaries and the company's interests in associates and jointly controlled entities.
The address of the company's registered office is 150 – 6th Avenue S.W., Calgary, Alberta, Canada, T2P 3E3.
2. BASIS OF PREPARATION
(a) Statement of Compliance
These condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS), specifically International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34 Interim Financial Reporting as issued
by the International Accounting Standards Board. They are condensed as they do not include all of the information required
for full annual financial statements, and they should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for
the year ended December 31, 2013.
The policies applied in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements are based on IFRS issued and
outstanding as at July 30, 2014, the date the Audit Committee approved these statements on behalf of the Board
of Directors.
(b) Basis of Measurement
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis except as detailed in the accounting policies
disclosed in the company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013, except for the
retrospective adoption of the following interpretation effective January 1, 2014:
International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee 21 Levies clarifies that an entity recognizes a liability for a levy
when the activity that triggers payment, as identified by the relevant legislation, occurs. It also clarifies that a levy liability
is accrued progressively only if the activity that triggers payment occurs over a period of time, and that a liability should
not be recognized before the specified minimum threshold to trigger that liability is reached. The adoption of this
interpretation did not have an impact to the company's condensed interim consolidated financial statements.
(c) Functional Currency and Presentation Currency
These consolidated financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars, which is the company's functional currency.
(d) Use of Estimates and Judgment
The timely preparation of financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions and use
judgment. Accordingly, actual results may differ from estimated amounts as future confirming events occur. Significant
estimates and judgment used in the preparation of the financial statements are described in the company's consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013.
SUNCOR ENERGY INC. 2014 SECOND QUARTER    47
3. SEGMENTED INFORMATION
The company's operating segments are reported based on the nature of their products and services and management
responsibility.
Intersegment sales of crude oil and natural gas are accounted for at market values and are included, for segmented
reporting, in revenues of the segment making the transfer and expenses of the segment receiving the transfer.
Intersegment amounts are eliminated on consolidation.

Other income of $145 million ($32 million after-tax) is for the reserves redetermination of 1.2 million barrels of oil receivable related to an interest in
a Norwegian asset that Suncor previously owned.
5. ASSET IMPAIRMENT
Oil Sands
Joslyn Mining Project
During the second quarter of 2014, the company recognized an after-tax impairment charge of $718 million related to the
company's interest in the project, charged against Property, Plant and Equipment ($318 million) and Exploration and
Evaluation assets ($400 million).
Total E&P Canada Ltd. (Total E&P), the operator of the Joslyn mining project, together with the company and the other co-
owners of the project, agreed to scale back certain development activities in order to focus on engineering studies to
further optimize the project development plan. As a result of the company's assessment of expected future net cash flows
and the uncertainty of the project, including the timing of the development plans, the company performed an impairment
test using a fair value less cost of disposal methodology, with a discounted cash flow approach, based on the latest
estimate of lease-wide contingent resources and a risk-adjusted discount rate of 9% (Level 3 fair value inputs). Relevant
market transactions were also considered. The calculation of the recoverable amount is sensitive to the likelihood and
timing of expected first oil, discount rate and capital construction costs.
Other
Following a review of repurpose options for assets that have been constructed for projects that have since been cancelled
or deferred, the company recognized an after-tax impairment charge of $223 million during the second quarter of 2014 for
certain Oil Sands assets, including a pipeline and related compressor, as well as steam generator components, as
management does not anticipate using these assets in the manner initially intended.
Exploration and Production
Libya
During the second quarter of 2014, the company recognized an after-tax impairment charge of $297 million related to its
Libyan assets, charged against Property, Plant and Equipment ($129 million) and Exploration and Evaluation assets
($168 million).
As a result of shut-in production due to the continued closure of certain Libyan export terminals and the company's
production plans for the remaining term of the Exploration and Production Sharing Agreements, the company performed an
impairment test on its Libyan assets using a fair value less cost of disposal methodology. An expected cash flow
approach was used based on 2013 year-end reserves data updated for current price forecasts and the current production
50   SUNCOR ENERGY INC. 2014 SECOND QUARTER
plans, with three scenarios representing i) resumption of operations in six months, ii) resumption of operations in
18 months, and iii) suspension of all activity at the end of 2015. The first two scenarios were equally weighted at 45% each
and the final scenario was assigned a weighting of 10%. All scenarios were present valued using a risk-adjusted discount
rate of 17%, and an average price of approximately US$103.00 per barrel through 2016-2021 escalated at an average of
2% per year thereafter (Level 3 fair value inputs). The calculation of the recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount
rate and prices. A 2% increase in discount rate and 5% decrease in price each would increase the after-tax impairment
charge by approximately $65 million.
The remaining carrying value of the company's net assets in Libya as at June 30, 2014 was approximately $300 million.

7. NORMAL COURSE ISSUER BID
On February 21, 2014, the company amended its Normal Course Issuer Bid that commenced on August 5, 2013 (the 2013
NCIB) to allow for an additional $1.0 billion worth of its common shares to be repurchased. Pursuant to the 2013 NCIB,
Suncor is permitted to purchase for cancellation a total of approximately $2.8 billion worth of its common shares between
August 5, 2013 and August 4, 2014. As at June 30, 2014, the company had repurchased a total of 41.3 million common
shares for a total consideration of $1.5 billion.
In July 2014, the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) accepted a notice filed by the company of its intention to renew its
normal course issuer bid (the 2014 NCIB) to continue to purchase shares under its previously announced buyback
program, through the facilities of the TSX, New York Stock Exchange and/or alternative trading platforms. The notice
provides that the company may purchase for cancellation up to approximately $1.1 billion worth of its common shares
beginning August 5, 2014 and ending August 4, 2015.

Pursuant to the previously disclosed 2013 proposal letter from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), the company received
a Notice of Reassessment (NOR) from the CRA during the second quarter of 2014, regarding the income tax treatment of
realized losses in 2007 on the settlement of certain derivative contracts. The total amount of the NOR including tax,
penalty and interest was approximately $920 million. The company strongly disagrees with the CRA's position and
continues to firmly believe it will be able to successfully defend its original filing position and will take the appropriate
actions to resolve this matter.
The company has provided security to the CRA for $460 million (50% of the NOR amount).
The company also expects to receive NORs from certain provincial tax authorities related to this matter for approximately
$280 million in the second half of 2014.
If the company is unsuccessful in defending its tax filing position, it could be subject to an earnings and cash impact of up
to $1.2 billion.

Cash payment alternatives are accounted for as cash-settled plans. As these awards can be exchanged for common shares of the company,
they are considered potentially dilutive and are included in the calculation of the company's diluted net earnings per share if they have a dilutive
impact in the period. Accounting for these awards as equity-settled was determined to have a dilutive impact for the six months ended
June 30, 2013.

During the second quarter of 2014, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and no
transfers into and out of Level 3 fair value measurements.
At June 30, 2014, the carrying value of fixed-term debt accounted for using the amortized cost method was $9.6 billion
(December 31, 2013 – $9.6 billion) and the fair value was $11.7 billion (December 31, 2013 – $11.2 billion). The estimated
fair value of long-term debt is based on pricing sourced from market data, which is considered Level 2 fair value inputs.
12. VOYAGEUR UPGRADER PROJECT
Effective March 27, 2013, the company acquired Total E&P's interest in Voyageur Upgrader Limited Partnership (VULP) for
$515 million and gained full control over the partnership assets. The transaction was accounted for as a business
combination.
As VULP was in the development stage and therefore had no revenues and the majority of costs were capitalized, no
significant net earnings were generated.
SUNCOR ENERGY INC. 2014 SECOND QUARTER    53
The fair value of consideration transferred and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition are
summarized below:

The fair value attributed to the property, plant and equipment acquired was based on an expected future cash flow
approach for assets expected to be retained, with a risk-adjusted discount rate of 10%. For assets expected to be sold,
the fair value was determined based on management's best estimate of the recoverable amount.
The fair value of the decommissioning and restoration provisions was determined based on management's best estimate of
the costs to complete the reclamation activities, the timing of cash outflows, method of reclamation, the discount rate and
management's anticipated use of the area in the future.
Following the acquisition, the company announced that it was not proceeding with the Voyageur upgrader project. The
decision was a result of a joint strategic and economic review launched by the company and its co-owner, Total E&P, in
response to a change in market conditions that challenged the economics of the project. As a result, a charge of
$176 million was recorded to net earnings during the first quarter of 2013 related to not proceeding with the upgrading
portion of the project. In the fourth quarter of 2013, an adjustment of $94 million was recorded to reduce the previously
estimated costs, resulting in a net charge of $82 million for 2013.
13. SALE OF NATURAL GAS BUSINESS
During the third quarter of 2013, the company sold a significant portion of its natural gas business for $1.0 billion before
closing adjustments and other closing costs. An after-tax gain of $130 million was recorded in the Exploration and
Production segment upon closing of the sale.
14. COMMITMENTS
During the six months ended June 30, 2014, the company increased its commitments by approximately $1.1 billion in
support of the company's market access strategy, activities to expand its storage and logistics network, and exploration
drilling activities.
15. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On July 17, 2014, the company completed an acquisition of a sulphur extraction business for a purchase price of
$120 million in its Refining and Marketing segment, subject to closing adjustments.
On July 30, 2014, the company's Board of Directors approved an increase to the company's quarterly dividend to $0.28 per
common share beginning in the third quarter of 2014.

58   SUNCOR ENERGY INC. 2014 SECOND QUARTER
QUARTERLY OPERATING SUMMARY (continued)
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Certain financial measures in this document – namely operating earnings (loss), cash flow from (used in) operations, return on capital employed and Oil
Sands cash operating costs – are not prescribed by GAAP. Suncor includes these financial measures because investors may use this information to
analyze operating performance, leverage and liquidity. The additional information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of
performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Operating earnings (loss) and Oil Sands cash operating costs for each quarter in 2014 and 2013 are each defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Advisory section and reconciled to GAAP measures in the Consolidated Financial Information and Segment Results and Analysis sections of each
respective quarterly Report to Shareholders issued in respect of the relevant quarter for 2014 and 2013 (Quarterly Report). Cash flow from (used in)
operations for each quarter 2014 and 2013 are defined and reconciled to GAAP measures in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Advisory section of each
respective Quarterly Report. The remainder of the non-GAAP financial measures not otherwise mentioned in this paragraph are defined and reconciled in
Suncor's Management's Discussion & Analysis contained in the 2013 Annual Report.
Definitions
Average sales price – This is calculated before royalties (where applicable) and net of related transportation costs.
Cash operating costs – Include cash costs that are defined as operating, selling and general expenses (excluding inventory changes and non-
production costs), and including operating revenues associated with excess power from cogeneration units.

Explanatory Notes
Users are cautioned that the Syncrude cash costs per barrel measure may not be fully comparable to similar information calculated by other
entities (including Suncor's own cash costs per barrel excluding Syncrude) due to differing operations of each company as well as their respective
accounting policy choices.
As of January 1, 2014, the Edmonton refinery's nameplate capacity increased to 142 mbbls/d. Comparative utilization percentages have not
been restated.
No sales were recorded in Libya as there were no liftings since the second quarter of 2013 due to continued political unrest.
