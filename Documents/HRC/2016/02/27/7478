<p><b>A/HRC/27/70/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>2</b>  
</p>
<p><b> I. Legal and Judicial Reform 
</b></p>
<p>1. Designing draft laws is under the competence of related individual institution by 
</p>
<p>preparing a legal text related to its institution before submitting to the council of ministers 
</p>
<p>for review and approval while there is no principle to allow this legal text to be publicized 
</p>
<p>and consulted by civil society. Upon review and approval, the draft is submitted to the 
</p>
<p>National Assembly (NA) for review and approval, chapter by chapter, by the members of 
</p>
<p>the parliamentarians (those who were elected by vote of confidence by the citizens) with a 
</p>
<p>simple majority of vote 50% +1, as stipulated in the constitution of Cambodia. Upon the 
</p>
<p>approval by the NA, the draft is submitted to the Senate, then to the King for his Royal 
</p>
<p>signature to enter into effect. Civil society is obviously important and useful partners for the 
</p>
<p>rehabilitation and the building of the country, especially for the developing countries like 
</p>
<p>Cambodia. However, in making laws or other legal instruments at national level, Cambodia 
</p>
<p>has its full-fledged rights to maintain itself as a sovereign state as stipulated in the 
</p>
<p>constitution of Cambodia, independent of civil society organizations and development 
</p>
<p>partners working under foreign support. 
</p>
<p>2. The preparation of the three fundamental laws is an important starting point for the 
</p>
<p>NA of its fifth legislative mandate on legal and judicial reform, which is one of the cores in 
</p>
<p>the government&#8217;s rectangular strategy, while the three laws will constitute a base to realize 
</p>
<p>the vision  of the government in strengthening good governance and rule of law. Moreover, 
</p>
<p>the three laws are laid out in the constitution and considered important organic laws 
</p>
<p>regarding the organization and the management of the process of the judicial power, one of 
</p>
<p>the three state&#8217;s powers, stipulated in the constitution. In the draft law on the statute of 
</p>
<p>judges and prosecutors, it ensures independence of the judicial power in accordance with 
</p>
<p>the constitution. Moreover, Chapter 2 states about the decision of the judges which is to be 
</p>
<p>done without bias under any pressure, threat/intimidation, or order. And the Supreme 
</p>
<p>Council of Magistracy (SCM) determines about the appointment, change, termination, 
</p>
<p>placing out of the framework or deletion of names of judges. Furthermore, Chapter 4 states 
</p>
<p>that judges and prosecutors are incompatible with public function, parliamentarians, 
</p>
<p>senators, government members, and other mandated functions through election or advisory 
</p>
<p>functions of all ranks. They also cannot be working as lawyer or doing business of any 
</p>
<p>kind. For the draft law on the organization of the court, not only it states about 
</p>
<p>independence of the court&#8217;s power and ensures effective public services, but it also states 
</p>
<p>about the creation of specialized courts of different fields, in order to strengthen the 
</p>
<p>capacity of judges, prosecutors and legal officers. Moreover, it states about the 
</p>
<p>establishment of the specialized chambers at the appeal court to ensure accuracy in 
</p>
<p>judgment. For the third draft law on the organization and the functioning of SCM, it states 
</p>
<p>about its organization and the functioning in order to assist the King to guarantee the 
</p>
<p>court&#8217;s independence, and it also states about the functions of members of SCM, which are 
</p>
<p>incompatible with functions of judges and prosecutors. 
</p>
<p>3. Therefore, the three above-mentioned laws obviously ensure court&#8217;s independence 
</p>
<p>in compliance with international standards, in promoting rights of citizens and in improving 
</p>
<p>the court&#8217;s working process in promoting justice service for the public. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Parliamentary Reform  
</b></p>
<p>4. The National Assembly of Cambodia, through the existing applicable laws, provides 
</p>
<p>possibility to parties with majority and minority seats with full rights to express their 
</p>
<p>opinions. According to the constitution and the internal rules of the NA, all 
</p>
<p>parliamentarians are entitled rights to expression without any prohibition. All </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/70/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>parliamentarians in the NA either from the ruling party or the opposition party have 
</p>
<p>immunity and have equal rights to oppose or to support policies or principles. 
</p>
<p>5. The constitution and the internal rules of the NA states clearly about the provision of 
</p>
<p>rights for the parliamentarians to track and monitor the implementation by the government, 
</p>
<p>rights to pose questions for debate, rights to issue admonition letter to the ministers and 
</p>
<p>rights to dissolve the government. Expert commissions with members from parties with 
</p>
<p>seats in the NA receive the draft laws or proposal of laws, so that they can comment and 
</p>
<p>make conclusions to propose to the NA to refute the drafts. 
</p>
<p>6. According to the agreement on the 22
nd
</p>
<p> July 2014 between parties with seats in the 
</p>
<p>NA, parliamentarians from the parties with majority and minority seats will continue to 
</p>
<p>work together in the reform of the NA structure to make it more transparent on all matters 
</p>
<p>by allocating the leading roles as follows: 
</p>
<p>7. Party with majority seats to be charged as the president of the NA, second deputy of 
</p>
<p>the NA, heads, deputy heads, secretaries of five expert commissions and 45 members of the 
</p>
<p>expert commissions. 
</p>
<p>8. Party with minority seats to be charged as the first deputy of the NA, heads, deputy 
</p>
<p>heads, secretaries of five expert commissions and 45 members of the expert commissions. 
</p>
<p>9. Overall, the Cambodia&#8217;s NA have been and is implementing its roles strictly in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the laws in Cambodia, especially the constitution and the internal rules of 
</p>
<p>the NA. Cambodia&#8217;s NA never restricts the rights to freedom of expression of its 
</p>
<p>parliamentarians. 
</p>
<p>10. Cambodia&#8217;s NA with members from the Cambodian People Party (CPP) and the 
</p>
<p>Cambodian National Rescue Party (CNRP) are working together to reform the NA&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>structure to make the body more transparent, based on the agreement on 22 July 2014. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Electoral Reform 
</b></p>
<p>11. During the national election for the fifth legislative mandate on the 28 July 2013, all 
</p>
<p>political parties have rights to use the media to broadcast their information. In the process 
</p>
<p>of the election, the National Election Committee (NEC) provided an enabling environment 
</p>
<p>for the public in general to exercise their rights and freedom of expression and public 
</p>
<p>gatherings. Furthermore, NEC always broadcast and encouraged national and international 
</p>
<p>organizations to disseminate information in all forms of media, state and private , to ensure 
</p>
<p>that every citizen receive sufficient information related to the election. Election campaigns 
</p>
<p>were done in a smooth, safe and transparent atmosphere. All political parties organized 
</p>
<p>campaigns and participated in observation during the election day and vote counting period. 
</p>
<p>There were observers from national and international NGOs and embassies. Almost all the 
</p>
<p>national and international observers have positively evaluated the election process. 
</p>
<p>12. After the national election on 28 July 2013, with some issues emerging, CPP and 
</p>
<p>CNRP issued a joint statement on 26 September 2013 on electoral reform. Meanwhile, the 
</p>
<p>Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) issued an announcement numbered 14 Pr.K dated 
</p>
<p>22 October 2013, assigning Ministry of Interior (MOI) to organize this national workshop 
</p>
<p>planned to be conducted in 2014 with participation of representatives from the Legislature, 
</p>
<p>Executive, registered political parties, representatives from NEC, civil societies, 
</p>
<p>international NGOs, development partners and other stakeholders to collect inputs, 
</p>
<p>comments and recommendations towards building an electoral reform framework in line 
</p>
<p>with the principles of multi-party democracy and rule of law, so that it will avoid any crises 
</p>
<p>in future elections. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/70/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>13. From 19-23 May 2014, a Japanese research team for electoral reform assistance 
</p>
<p>arrived in Cambodia to meaningfully study and discuss in detailed with relevant 
</p>
<p>stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>14. More especially, in accordance with the agreement on 22 July 2014 and the joint 
</p>
<p>statement on 16 September 2013, the two political parties agreed to electoral reform by 
</p>
<p>turning this election  body into a fully independent body enshrined in the constitution, while 
</p>
<p>members in the composition are to be elected by the simple majority vote of the NA. 
</p>
<p>15. Currently the technical working of the two political parties have met to discuss the 
</p>
<p>procedures for electoral reform in Cambodia in order to make a good law which is 
</p>
<p>acceptable for all in the future.   
</p>
<p><b> IV. Land Reform 
</b></p>
<p>16. With reference to the land reform, the Royal Government of Cambodia would like to 
</p>
<p>provide the following comments on the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report: 
</p>
<p>17. Para. 46, line 11:&#8230;&#8230;.a white paper on land policy <b>to be adopted by the end of 
</b></p>
<p><b>2014 </b>and the drafting of&#8230;&#8230;  
</p>
<p>18. Para. 49 and 50: requested to be deleted and add a following new paragraph instead: 
</p>
<p><b>Based on the statistic of land titling database, there are only 0.4% disputes in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>systematic land registration and 0.8% in the Directive 01 BB. Through the 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of Directive 01 BB, the Royal Government has decided to donate land 
</b></p>
<p><b>with the total side of 1.2 million hectares (cut off the land from economic land 
</b></p>
<p><b>concession and other state land) for 500,000 households which are equal to 710,000 
</b></p>
<p><b>parcels. So far there are 550,000 titles have been distributed to the people. This 
</b></p>
<p><b>contributes a lot to solving land dispute in Cambodia. Besides, there are adequate 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms in place to address land disputes. The Cadastral Commission 
</b></p>
<p><b>(District/Khan/Municipal, Province and Capital and National levels) is mandated to 
</b></p>
<p><b>address disputes related to unregistered land. To accelerate this resolution of 
</b></p>
<p><b>unregistered land, Mobile Teams were also created to cope with more land dispute 
</b></p>
<p><b>locations. Regarding the systematic land titling process, those disputes occur in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>adjudication areas are solved by the administrative commission, which is mandated to 
</b></p>
<p><b>conciliate the disputing parties at the site. While the National Authority for Resolution 
</b></p>
<p><b>of Land Dispute (NARLD) composes of wide-range stakeholders, is in place to solve 
</b></p>
<p><b>the complex land disputes which involves multi-parties and beyond the competence of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Cadastral Commission. In relation to land disputes associated with land which 
</b></p>
<p><b>already registered in land register, it is under the competence of the courts. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>process of land dispute resolution is a rule based procedures in compliance with 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights based approach, which enable the parties to tackle their disputes in a 
</b></p>
<p><b>transparent manner. This is to assure the fairness of solving the disputes. Through 
</b></p>
<p><b>these mechanisms, there are remarkable achievements in solving land disputes. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Despite the fact of the efforts, the Royal Government is committed to improving the 
</b></p>
<p><b>process and effectiveness of solving land disputes at all aspects, better information 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided to and cooperation with stakeholders, capacity and institutional building.    
</b></p>
<p>Recommendation (n): Immediately <b>Continue to</b> solve the existing disputes relating to land 
</p>
<p>rights as a matter of priority, and ensure in law and in practice that new land concession are 
</p>
<p>granted only when the rights of the people affected by them are provided for. Review all 
</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;..meet these standards.   
</p>
<p> Notes : 1-Cambodia proposed to delete the above phrases and paragraphs because they do 
</p>
<p>not reflect the facts of the current situation in Cambodia). </p>

<p><b> V. UPR Report of Cambodia 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Cambodian Human Rights Committee (CHRC) defended its UPR report from 
</p>
<p>28-31 January 2014 while 76 member states  (out of 193) made 205 recommendations. On 
</p>
<p>26 June 2014, in its 32
nd
</p>
<p> session, the Human Rights Council adopted the recommendations 
</p>
<p>where Cambodia accepted 163 and noted 42. 
</p>
<p>20. Among the 163 Cambodia accepted , as some are similar in content, they were 
</p>
<p>grouped into 48 recommendations. 
</p>
<p>21. For the 42 noted recommendations, Cambodia observes that: 4 recommendations go 
</p>
<p>against Cambodia&#8217;s constitution and laws, affecting Cambodia&#8217;s sovereign and are not 
</p>
<p>appropriate for Cambodia, while Cambodia still needs more time to consider and discuss 
</p>
<p>with relevant ministries for the other 38 recommendations. 
</p>
<p>22. Cambodia welcomes recommendations on what Cambodia has not yet done or not 
</p>
<p>yet none well. However, Cambodia is not going to accept recommendations on what 
</p>
<p>Cambodia has already done or is taking actions smoothly. For most of the 205 
</p>
<p>recommendations, Cambodia has done or are getting positive results. At the meantime, a 
</p>
<p>number of recommendations do not reflect reality in Cambodia, which Cambodia cannot 
</p>
<p>accept. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Independence of National Human Rights Institution 
</b></p>
<p>23. On the establishment of this institution, on 26 September 2006, RGC under the 
</p>
<p>leadership of Samdech Hun Sen, opened a national workshop on the establishment of the 
</p>
<p>National Human Rights Institution in Cambodia. Held in Siem Reap province. The 
</p>
<p>workshop was participated by speakers from regional human rights working groups 
</p>
<p>including the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand to share their experiences. 
</p>
<p>During that occasion, Samdech Hun Sen tasked civil societies to draft the law based on the 
</p>
<p>Paris Principles on the Establishment of the National Human Rights Institution. In 2007, 
</p>
<p>joint working group between the government headed by HE Om Yintieng, Senior Minister, 
</p>
<p>and NGOs headed by Mrs. Pung Chhivgech started the process of making action plans to 
</p>
<p>draft this law. After 5 consecutive meetings, and after the joint working group paid visit to 
</p>
<p>the Philippines, draft law on the establishment of the NHRI was finalized on 6 February 
</p>
<p>2010 in Preah Sihanouk province. Recently, in the meeting with Professor Surya  Subedi on 
</p>
<p>15 January 2014, Samdech Jun Sen urged for more discussion with civil society on this 
</p>
<p>matter. Then there should be a national workshop to collect more inputs, comments and 
</p>
<p>recommendations from legal practitioners, lawyers and other relevant stakeholders to 
</p>
<p>produce a good draft law and submit this finalized draft to the Council of Ministers to 
</p>
<p>proceed. 
</p>
<p>24. Regarding National Preventive Mechanism (NPM) against Torture, Cambodia 
</p>
<p>signed to be a state party in New York city on 14 December 2005 and was promulgated 
</p>
<p>through a Royal Kram number NS/NKM/0107/002, dated 19 January 2007. To comply 
</p>
<p>with the spirit of this Optional Protocol, The RGC issued a sub-decree numbered 122 
</p>
<p>ANKr.PrK, dated 7 August 2009 on the establishment of the National Preventive 
</p>
<p>Mechanism for temporary functioning. To make the mechanism an effective one, the MOI 
</p>
<p>issue Prakas numbered 1177 PrK, dated 6 July 2010 on the establishment of the Secretariat 
</p>
<p>for National Preventive Mechanism against Torture directly under the NPM. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/70/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>25. From 1-11 December 2009, subcommittee for the prevention against torture (SPT) 
</p>
<p>visited Cambodia for the first time. They visited prisons and police stations in a number of 
</p>
<p>provinces, in line with the principles of SPT. From 12-17 December 2013, SPT visited 
</p>
<p>Cambodia for the second time and they visited a number of prisons and police stations, as 
</p>
<p>well as organizing a workshop on the establishment of the National Preventive Mechanism 
</p>
<p>in Cambodia. 
</p>
<p>26. For the time being, the drafting process is under discussion between MOI and 
</p>
<p>OHCHR, to ensure that it is in compliance with OPCAT. 
</p>
<p>27. Though we have not had the so-called NHRI in accordance with the Paris Principles, 
</p>
<p>we still can ensure the promotion and the protection of human rights in accordance with our 
</p>
<p>existing laws effectively, while, at the same time, being , willingly committed with firm 
</p>
<p>stance to enhance national economic growth in order to move forwards to poverty 
</p>
<p>reduction, social justice, and multi-party democratic process and rule of law in Cambodia.
