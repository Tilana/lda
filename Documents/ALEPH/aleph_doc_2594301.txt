PART III - NARRATIVE
State below in reasonable detail why Forms 10-K, 20-F, 11-K, 10-Q, 10-D, N-SAR, N-CSR, or the
transition report or portion thereof, could not be filed within the prescribed time period.
The Company’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ending June 30, 2016 cannot be
filed within the prescribed time period for the following reasons:
1.)
The Company has not yet filed its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ending September
30, 2015. Because of the delay in filing of the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K, the
Company could not complete its quarterly consolidated financial statements and supporting
documents for the period ending June 30, 2016 within the prescribed time period without
unreasonable expense and effort. In order for the Company to allow for sufficient time for the
Company to complete its June 30, 2016 quarter end consolidated financial statements and to
allow time for the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm to review and
render its opinion on the Company’s June 30, 2016 quarter end consolidated financial
statements, the Company will require more time for the completion of financial statements and
in addition the auditor will require time to review the Company’s quarter end consolidated
financial statements.
The Company currently anticipates filing its June 30, 2016 quarterly report on Form 10-Q and its
related XBRL documents along with its December 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016 quarterly reports
on Form 10-Q and their related XBRL documents immediately after it has filed its September 30,
2016 annual report on Form 10-K.

Act of 1934 or Section 30 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 during the preceding 12

If the answer is no, identify report(s). Yes o No þ
The Company has not yet filed its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ending September 30,
2015, nor has it filed its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the period ending December 31, 2015
and March 31, 2016.
(3) Is it anticipated that any significant change in results of operations from the corresponding
period for the last fiscal year will be reflected by the earnings statements to be included in the
subject report or portion thereof? Yes o No þ
If so, attach an explanation of the anticipated change, both narratively and quantitatively, and, if
