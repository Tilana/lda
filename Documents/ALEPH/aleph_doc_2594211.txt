Technical Information
The technical information contained in this MD&A has been reviewed and approved by Thomas
Patton  Ph.D.,  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  the  Company,  and  a  non-independent
“qualified person” as defined in NI 43-101.
Summary for the six months ended June 30, 2016
In August 2015, the Company’s subsidiary Singatse Peak Services LLC (“SPS”) commenced an
exploration drilling program at the Bear deposit – a large porphyry copper system – located on
the Company’s 51-square-mile property in the historic Yerington Copper District of Nevada. The
program has been funded by Freeport-McMoRan Nevada LLC (“Freeport Nevada”) in terms of an
option  agreement  whereby  Freeport  Nevada  can  acquire  an  initial  55%  interest  in  SPS  by
spending $40.75 million in three stages starting in June 2014.
From June 2015 to June 2016, Freeport Nevada provided $8.4 million funds to SPS with SPS
receiving  $3.825  million  during  the  first  six  months  of  2016.  Funds  have  been  used  to  fund
exploration drilling at the Bear Deposit, as well as land, water and minerals rights maintenance,
compliance with environmental law and general administrative expenditures.
In  January,  April  and  July  2016,  the  Company  received  payments  each  of  $500,000  from
Freeport-McMoRan  Mineral  Properties  LLC  (“FMMP”)  in  terms  of  a  2014  agreement  whereby
FMMP  acquired  the  remaining  interests  in  three  of  the  Company’s  non-core  copper  and
molybdenum properties for $5 million. In terms of the agreement $1.0 million was paid on Closing
and  the  balance  was  payable  in  tranches  of  $500,000  every  quarter  for  eight  consecutive
quarters commencing January 1, 2015. As of August 11, a total of $4.5 million has been received
from FMMP, with $500,000 still owing.
On February 8, 2016, Quaterra and SPS announced results from Hole B-050, the third core hole
of the drill program to explore and further define the Bear deposit. Hole B-050, drilled vertically to
a depth of 3,838 feet, intercepted 521.9 feet (159.1 meters) of 0.36% copper beginning at a depth
of 2,429.2 feet. Included within this interval is 279.3 feet (85.1 meters) of 0.44% copper starting at
2,491.4  feet.  A  6.1  -foot  (1.9  meter)  interval  of  massive  pyrite-magnetite-chalcopyrite  skarn
starting at 2,330.5 feet averages 1.91% copper, 0.22 ppm gold and 5.7 ppm silver. Hole B-050
extended the Bear mineralized system an additional 650 feet north of the nearest historic drill
hole. The hole was collared 1,050 feet north-northeast of Hole B-048. Drill intercepts are based
on actual core lengths and may not reflect the true width of mineralization. The results of the two
previous holes, B-048 and B-049, were announced on November 17 and December 23, 2015
respectively, and are available on the Company website.
On April 6, Quaterra and SPS announced the results from Hole B-051, the fourth core hole of the
program to explore and further define the Bear deposit. Hole B-051, drilled vertically to a depth of
3,878  feet,  intercepted  1,483.3  feet  (452.1  meters)  of  0.26%  copper  beginning  at  a  depth  of
2,191.2 feet. Included within this interval is 1,213.8 feet (370.0 meters) of 0.30% copper starting at
2,191.2  feet.  Several  narrower  intervals  contain  >0.40%  copper  with  anomalous  gold  and
molybdenum. Hole B-051 is a significant step-out from the nearest hole, B-049, approximately
1,150 feet to the west. The thickness of the mineralized intercept in B-051 is larger than those in
the  three  previous  holes  of  the  drilling  program.  Bornite  also  is  more  common,  occurring  with
chalcopyrite and molybdenite in quartz-sulfide veins, veinlet swarms and stockworks. The quartz-
sulfide  veins  appear  to  correlate  with  higher  gold  and  molybdenum  values  found  in  B-051
compared  to  the  three  previous  drill  holes.  The  interval  3,253  to  3278  feet  averaged  0.43%
copper, 182 ppm molybdenum and 0.12 ppm gold over 25 feet; the interval 2,218 to 2,241.9 feet
averaged 445 ppm molybdenum over 23.9 feet.
On April 15, 2016, Quaterra announced that Gerald Prosalendis had been named President and
Chief  Operating  Officer  of  the  Company.  To  accommodate  this  appointment,  Thomas  Patton
resigned as President while retaining the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
On May 24, Quaterra and SPS announced results from Hole B-052, the fifth core hole in the Bear
deposit drill program. Hole B-052, drilled vertically to a depth of 3,468 feet, intercepted two zones
of 0.4% copper, the first of 43 feet (13.1 meters) with 201 ppm molybdenum starting at 2,508 feet
and another of 29 feet (8.8 meters) starting at 2,667 feet. Overall, the hole intercepted 666.2 feet
(203.1 meters) of 0.14% copper mineralization beginning at a depth of 2,081.3 feet. Hole B-052,
collared 700 feet north-northeast of hole B-051, was sited to determine if the favorable alteration
and mineralization intersected in hole B-051 extended and strengthened to the north. Although
the  alteration  and  style  of  mineralization  encountered  in  hole  B-052  is  similar  to  B-051,  the
narrower and lower grade mineralization shows that this is most likely not the case. Molybdenite
is more common than in previous SPS holes, occurring in narrow quartz veins that cut and often
offset chalcopyrite-pyrite veins and veinlets and continuing over a longer vertical range (709.5
feet) than the copper mineralization. The lower copper and gold grades, combined with a higher
pyrite/chalcopyrite ratio, indicate that hole B-052 was drilled in a more distal part of the system.
Additional drilling will be necessary to test this concept as Bear mineralization remains open in
three directions.

Interim MD&A – Quarterly Highlights
For the six months ended June 30, 2016
On June 9, 2016, Quaterra and SPS announced results from the sixth and final drill hole of the
2015 and 2016 drill program. Hole GHH-001 is located in Ground Hog Hills, an area with no
historic drilling about 6,000 feet south of previous SPS holes. It was drilled vertically to a depth of
2,017.5 feet and cased for possible future deepening. Sporadic zones of copper mineralization
were  intersected  which  are  interpreted  as  an  extension  of  Bear  mineralization  to  the  north.
Mineralization included 10 feet of supergene enriched chalcocite mineralization averaging 0.33%
copper beginning at a depth of 230 feet and 30 feet of oxide copper averaging 0.15% copper
beginning  at  350 
intersected  primary  chalcopyrite
mineralization,  including  128  feet  of  0.21%  copper  and  narrow,  widely  spaced  sulfide  veins
containing  elevated  to  highly  anomalous  antimony,  arsenic,  cobalt,  zinc,  molybdenum,  gold,
silver  and  copper  averaging  greater  than  one  per  cent.  This  mineralization  occurs  within  a
propylitically altered cap interpreted to overlie potassically altered copper mineralization at depth.
feet.  Core  drilling  below  400
feet
The six-hole 2015 and 2016 exploration program totaled 20,274.5 feet of drilling. The five holes
at  Bear,  including  twin  hole  B-048,  totaled  18,257  feet.  Results  from  Hole  B-048  supported
historic assays from Hole 23B drilled in 1966 by Anaconda. Drilling results from holes B-049 to
B-052  were  successful  in  extending  the  Bear  mineralization  an  additional  2,000  feet  north-
northeast by 3,000 feet northwest-southeast, with the average mineralized intercept in these four
step-out holes averaging approximately 1,000 feet in thickness. The Bear system remains open
in  three  directions.  Copper  mineralization  is  overlain  by  ubiquitous  propylitic  alteration  with
moderate  to  strong  phyllic  alteration,  often  laced  with  tourmaline  veining  and  flooding.
Significantly higher grades, if present, will most likely be found where quartz monzonite is cut by
quartz  monzonite  porphyry  dikes  as  occurs  at  the  nearby  Yerington  mine.  The  Bear  porphyry
copper deposit currently covers more than two square miles.
On June 13, 2016, Quaterra and SPS announced they had reached an agreement with Freeport
Nevada to extend the current Stage 2 of Freeport Nevada’s option to acquire an interest in the
Company’s Yerington Copper Project in Nevada for up to two years by Freeport Nevada making
option payments totalling $5.75 million. In terms this amended agreement, Stage 2 of Freeport
Nevada’s earn-in option, which commenced in June last year, can be extended for up to four
additional  periods  of  six  months  each  by  Freeport  Nevada  making  the  following  payments  to
SPS: $1.8 million on June 13, 2016 which has been received; $1.25 million on December 13,
2016; $1.35 million on June 13, 2017; and $1.35 on December 13, 2017. SPS intends to use the
Freeport  Nevada’s  option  payments  for  property  maintenance,  G&A  and  environmental
compliance at Yerington. Freeport Nevada will have the right to terminate the agreement at any
time with 60 days’ notice.
During the two-year extension period, SPS may propose special exploration programs, including
work plans and budgets, to be undertaken with Freeport Nevada’s agreement under an annual
drilling program. These programs will be funded by Freeport Nevada, at its discretion, through
accelerated  option  payments.  The  Stage  2  extension  option  payments  and  any  accelerated
option payments will reduce the payments required for Freeport Nevada to earn its initial 55%
interest in SPS. SPS is currently working at identifying compelling targets for the next phase of
drilling.
SPS will continue to initiate and self-fund desktop studies to assess the over-all development
potential at Yerington, and surface work including geophysical surveys to better understand the
Bear porphyry copper deposit, one of three known copper deposits on the Company’s 51-square
mile Yerington land package. Geophysical surveys will also assist in future drill site selection.
Freeport Nevada has the option to participate in these studies as part of due diligence.

Interim MD&A – Quarterly Highlights
For the six months ended June 30, 2016
On July 14, 2016, Quaterra announced the sale of its remaining 35% participating interest in the
Herbert  Glacier  project,  Alaska,  to  its  joint  venture  partner  Grande  Portage  Resources  Ltd
(“Grande Portage”). On closing, Grande Portage issued to Quaterra 1,182,331 shares, equal to
9%  of  its  issued  and  outstanding  common  shares.  In  addition,  Grande  Portage  will  allot  and
deliver to Quaterra within five business days of a financing or financings totaling up to $1 million
that number of additional shares required to maintain Quaterra’s interest at 9%. Grand Portage
will also pay Quaterra $250,000 within 90 days of receipt of a feasibility report for the property or
in  event  of  a  change  of  control  or  sale.  Grande  Portage  will  assume  any  and  all  obligations
related to Quaterra’s participating interest under the JV agreement.
Also on July 14, 2016, Quaterra reported that the previously announced sale of its 50% interest in
the Nieves project, Mexico, has been concluded with payment of the final $1.0 million tranche
owing to Quaterra by Blackberry Ventures, I LLC on June 30, 2016. Quaterra no longer holds any
interest  in  assets  in  Mexico.  These  two  transaction  represent  the  conclusion  of  Quaterra’s
previously announced strategy to dispose of all non-core assets. The funds raised from these
efforts will continue to provide Quaterra with the resources to focus its efforts on exploring and
developing its assets in the historic copper district of Yerington, Nevada.
Review of Operations and Financial Results
During three months ended June 2016, the Company incurred a loss of $1.81 million, year-to-
date $1.1 million, compared to a $2.2 million loss (year-to-date $2.3 million) in the same period
2015. Q2 2016 is significantly affected by the non-cash impairment for the Herbert Gold property,
and fair value calculations on derivative liability for both quarters.
Excluding non-cash items, general administrative expenses decreased by $103,000 mainly due
to  the  reduction  in  personnel  costs  which  were  partially  offset  by  higher  administration  and
general office expense due to the expensing of insurance premium paid in 2016.
As part of the continued effort to focus on its copper assets in Nevada, the Company concluded
the  Nieves  sale  and  disposed  of  its  Mexican  subsidiary  for  gross  proceeds  of  $500,000  in
January 2016. The Company is no longer operating in Mexico.
Quarterly Information Trends
The  Company’s  results  have  been  largely  driven  by  the  level  of  its  property  holding  costs,
exploration  activities  and  recoveries  from  partners.  The  Company  has  had  no  revenue  from
mining operations since its inception. Major variations in costs are summarized below:
Significant increases and decreases quarter to quarter in the Company’s stock price can
have a significant impact on the value of the derivative liabilities issued by the Company in
conjunction with debt and equity instruments.
The gain or loss on disposal of mineral properties is dependent on the negotiated sales
proceeds and can vary significantly from property to property.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arise because the Company conducts certain of its
activities and holds financial assets in U.S. Dollars and Canadian dollars, and reports its
financial results in U.S. Dollars.
Share-based payments can vary widely from quarter to quarter based on the timing, amount
and tenure of stock option awards.
Interest earned and financing costs vary based on the timing, type and amount of debt and
equity placements and resultant fluctuations in cash.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
To  date,  Quaterra  has  been  dependent  on  equity,  joint  venture  partners’  contribution  and
proceeds from disposal of certain mineral properties for funding. As of August 11, 2016, cash on
hand plus short-term investments are $6.2 million and working capital is $6.0 million.
During six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company incurred $3.65 million expenditures in
mineral properties, received a total of $3.825 million under the Option Agreement with Freeport
Nevada, $1.0 million from the none-core asset sale agreement with FMMP, and $1.0 million from
the final tranche of the Nieves sale agreement with Blackberry entered into in 2014.
The funds received under the Option Agreement have been primarily used in the Bear Deposit
drilling  program,  Yerington  Assets  mineral  rights  acquisitions  and  claim  maintenance,  and
general administrative support.
Funds received from assets sales have been used in working capital for corporate activities and
expenses.
With the cash on hand, the Company believes it has sufficient cash to maintain its operations in
the next 12 months.
The  Company  has  a  $500,000  convertible  note  due  on  January  2,  2017.  The  outstanding
principal may be converted by the note holder at rate of CAD$0.10 per share at any time until
maturity. The Company borrowed $500,000 from Freeport Nevada bearing an interest rate of 5%.
In the event Freeport Nevada terminates the Option Agreement, the $500,000 along with interest
is due 180 days after such a termination notice from Freeport Nevada.
Accounts payable and other accrued liabilities were incurred at market rates with arm’s length
third party suppliers, primarily for goods and services related to the Company’s exploration of its
Yerington Assets, and also for professional fees and other overhead expenses incurred in the
normal course of operations. The Company is not aware of any contingencies as at June 30,
2016.

Changes in Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates
The  significant  accounting  policies  applied  in  preparation  of  the  financial  statements  are
consistent  with  those  applied  and  disclosed  in  the  Note  2  of  the  Company’s  2015  audited
consolidated  financial  statements.  Adoptions  of  new  standards  and  amendments  to  existing
standards  have  had  no  material  impact  on  the  Company’s  financial  position  or  financial
performance.
Critical  accounting  estimates  remain  the  same  as  disclosed  in  the  2015  audited  annual
consolidated financial statements.
Financial Instruments
The  Company  has  designated  its  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  amounts  due  from  exploration
partners,  short-term  investments,  reclamation  bonds,  accounts  payable  and  accrued  liabilities,
loan payable and derivative liabilities as financial instruments.
Derivative  liability  is  measured  at  fair  value  and  categorized  in  Level  3.  The  fair  value  of  the
derivative  liability  is  based  on  the  Black-Scholes  option  pricing  model  as  determined  at  the
reporting  date.  The  rest  of  the  financial  instruments  approximate  their  fair  values  due  to  their
short-term nature. The carrying values of the reclamation bonds approximate their fair values, as
these balances are redeemable on demand.
Unless  otherwise  noted,  it  is  management’s  opinion  that  the  Company  is  not  exposed  to
significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from financial instruments.
