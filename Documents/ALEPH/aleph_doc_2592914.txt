PART III – NARRATIVE
State below in reasonable detail why Forms 10-K, 20-F, 11-K, 10-Q, 10-D, N-SAR, N-CSR, or the
transition report or portion thereof, could not be filed within the prescribed time period.
Spotlight Innovation Inc. (the "Registrant") was unable, without unreasonable effort or expense,
to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016 (the "Quarterly
Report") on the filing date applicable to smaller reporting companies due to a delay experienced
by the Registrant in completing its financial statements and other disclosures in its Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the "Annual Report"). The Registrant is
currently completing this process and gathering all necessary supporting documentation so that
its independent registered public accountant can complete the audit of the Registrant's financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, to be incorporated in the Annual Report.
Therefore, the Company is unsure it will be able to file the Quarterly Report within the five
calendar day period set forth in Rule 12b-25 under the Securities Exchange Act, as amended.
