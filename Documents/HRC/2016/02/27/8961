<p><b>Summary

<p> The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 7/34. It is the 
first report submitted to the Council by the present mandate holder, whose appointment started 
on 1 August 2008. It was prepared after the conclusion of the Durban Review Conference, held 
in April 2009, and examines in detail its outcome document, as well as the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
reflections on the Durban Review process. The Special Rapporteur also addresses the issue of 
poverty and racism, which he considers one of the fundamental challenges in the fight against 
racism. 
</p>
<p> The Durban Review Conference was particularly important to mark the renewal of the 
international engagement against racism. During the preparatory process leading up to the 
Conference, the Special Rapporteur requested Member States to approach the Review 
Conference constructively and in a cooperative spirit, arguing that the problems relating to 
racism were too important for the Conference to be allowed to fail. Despite the absence of some 
Member States, the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference was adopted 
consensually by all Member States attending the Conference; a remarkable achievement, 
particularly in the highly tense political atmosphere surrounding the Conference.  
</p>
<p> A central dimension of the fight against racism is the overlap between two key social 
indicators: class and race or ethnicity. Throughout his mandate, the Special Rapporteur intends to 
examine this question in depth in order to provide sound and policy-oriented recommendations 
to Member States. For many reasons, including the lack of ethnically disaggregated data, the 
links between race and poverty have yet to be fully elucidated. In particular, there are no existing 
instruments for this type of data collection worldwide, which would allow for cross-regional 
comparison of the levels of poverty in minorities. However, national data for many countries 
unambiguously show that racial or ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected by poverty. 
The Special Rapporteur recalls that the socio-economic vulnerability of minorities is frequently 
the result of historical legacies, such as slavery across the American continent, systems of 
inherited status in other continents and also of systems of formalized and State-sponsored 
discrimination against minorities that were long in place in many parts of the world. Because of 
the inaction of Governments, imbalances that were historically created continued to profoundly 
affect minority groups long after formalized discrimination was dismantled. The Special 
Rapporteur highlights that a number of concrete measures are needed in order to address the 
disproportionate levels of poverty enjoyed by members of minorities.  </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report, prepared pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 7/34, is the first 
report to be submitted to the Council by the current mandate holder, whose appointment 
commenced on 1 August 2008. Prepared after the conclusion of the Durban Review Conference, 
it examines in detail its outcome document, and the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s reflections on the 
Durban Review process (part I). The Special Rapporteur also addresses the issue of poverty and 
racism, which he considers a fundamental challenge in the fight against racism (part II). 
</p>
<p><b>II.  DURBAN REVIEW CONFERENCE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Renewing the international engagement against racism 
</b></p>
<p>2. The holding of the Durban Review Conference in April 2009 marked the renewal of 
international engagement against racism. During the preparatory process leading up to the 
Conference, the Special Rapporteur requested Member States to approach the Review 
Conference constructively and in a cooperative spirit, arguing that the problems related to racism 
were too important for the Conference to be allowed to fail. In particular, in a press release 
issued on 21 March 2009, on the occasion of the International Day for the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination, the Special Rapporteur called upon States and civil society organizations alike to 
participate in the negotiations leading to the Review Conference. The Special Rapporteur 
stressed that the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action remained the most 
comprehensive international framework to fight racism. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur would like to recall his statement made at the plenary session 
under item 9 of the Durban Review Conference, when he stated that, by showing their 
commitment to the international anti-racism movement, Member States were also sending an 
important signal to their relevant domestic constituencies: that racism was unacceptable and 
would be vigorously combated by the different institutions of the State within all possible 
parameters of the law. He added that engaging in the Durban Review process also meant leaving 
political agendas outside; ideological divides only made people lose sight of the real and 
concrete problem of racism and those who suffer from it. A renewed international engagement 
against racism was as urgent as it had ever been. For that reason, he once again called upon all 
members of the international community, in particular those who had chosen not to participate in 
the Durban Review Conference, to re-engage internationally on the common cause of eradicating 
racism. He particularly called on the United States and President Obama to provide leadership in 
this process, building on its historical experience of combating racism. 
</p>
<p>4. Despite the absence of some Member States, the outcome document of the Durban Review 
Conference was adopted consensually by all Member States attending the Conference. This is a 
remarkable achievement, particularly in the highly tense political atmosphere surrounding the 
Review Conference. The Special Rapporteur therefore regrets that 10 Member States decided not 
to participate in the Conference. The Special Rapporteur is convinced that the outcome 
document reflects the able manner in which the preparatory process was managed, in particular 
by the Chairperson of the intersessional working group, as well as the important but difficult 
concessions that were made by many parties. The Special Rapporteur underlines that this is the 
way the United Nations has been designed to work, focusing on common ground rather than 
division.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Outcome document of the Durban Review Conference 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur notes that, eight years since the Durban Conference, there remains 
an unprecedented level of disinformation and misinformation concerning the contents of the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur believes 
that specific awareness-raising activities regarding the content of both the Durban Declaration 
and Programme of Action and the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference should 
be undertaken in order to ensure that public information concerning the objectives of these 
landmark texts are widely disseminated, particularly among the media. In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur also recalls that the outcome document called on the United Nations system, in 
particular the Department of Public Information, to undertake effective media campaigns to 
enhance the visibility of the message of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and 
its follow-up mechanisms (para. 143). 
</p>
<p>6. The outcome document of the Durban Review Conference also contains a number of 
provisions that will directly and specifically guide the work of international mechanisms and the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in the fight 
against racism. The Special Rapporteur makes particular reference to the recommendation that 
examples of best practices be compiled and duly publicized by OHCHR (para. 50) as a means to 
inform policymaking around the world. Creating the institutional framework for the adequate 
promotion and sharing of best practices in the fight against racism will help the international 
community draw on positive lessons that can be transferred to other contexts, which is indeed 
one of the important roles the United Nations system can play in this process. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Freedom of expression and the fight against racism 
</b></p>
<p>7. The issue of freedom of expression and the fight against racism has been one of the key 
questions during negotiations on the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference. The 
Special Rapporteur believes that the text agreed upon at the Review Conference represents a 
landmark in the way the United Nations human rights system will approach this question in the 
years to come. In this regard, he commends all Member States involved in the negotiations for 
ably finding such common ground, which will facilitate the implementation of these 
commitments in the future. 
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that the outcome document unambiguously 
recognizes the positive role that freedom of opinion and expression can play in combating 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance (para. 54) and that it constitutes 
one of the essential foundations of a democratic and pluralistic society (para. 58).  
</p>
<p>9. At the same time, the outcome document also expresses concern over the rise in recent 
years of acts of incitement to hatred, which have targeted and severely affected racial and 
religious communities and persons belonging to racial and religious minorities. In this regard, the 
Special Rapporteur recalls that the outcome document resolved to, as stipulated in article 20 of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, fully and effectively prohibit any 
advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, 
hostility or violence. In addition, the outcome document also makes reference to article 4 of the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and general 
recommendation No. 14 of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, by </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>reaffirming that &#8220;all dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, incitement to 
racial discrimination as well as all acts of violence or incitement to such acts shall be declared an 
offence punishable by law, in accordance with the international obligations of States and that 
these prohibitions are consistent with freedom of opinion and expression&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that the outcome document focused exclusively 
on the language of legal provisions as established by international instruments, in particular the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The fact that the outcome document was 
adopted by consensus confirms that the language from these instruments is indeed the way 
forward in the approach to difficult questions, such as that of incitement to racial or religious 
hatred.  
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur would also like to highlight the joint statement he delivered with 
the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, Asma Jahangir, and the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, 
Frank La Rue, during a side event at the Durban Review Conference on incitement to racial or 
religious hatred.<b>1</b> In particular, the three mandate holders stated that it was necessary to anchor 
the debate on these issues in the relevant existing international legal framework, provided for by 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Whereas the Covenant provided for 
freedom of expression, it also clearly defined limitations to it, such as in articles 19 and 20. 
Furthermore, article 20 (2) required States to prohibit expressions if they amount to advocacy of 
national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility and 
violence. However, defining which acts might trigger article 20 remained difficult. They asked 
what constituted incitement to violence, hostility or discrimination and where the line between 
criticism - even if deemed offensive - and hate speech should be drawn. From a legal 
perspective, they affirmed that each set of facts was particular and could only be assessed and 
adjudicated, whether by a judge or another impartial body, according to its own circumstances 
and taking into account the specific context.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>D.  Next steps: transforming pledges into action 
</b></p>
<p>12. Many of the provisions contained in the outcome document of the Durban Review 
Conference would not have been needed had the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action 
been properly and effectively implemented. Unfortunately, not only is racism still pervasive 
around the world, but the appropriate institutions, legislation and policy needed to adequately 
fight this problem are not in place in most countries. 
</p>
<p>13. The key challenge in the next few years is therefore to transform the pledges and 
commitments made in the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference, as well as in 
the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action itself, into concrete actions that truly have an 
impact on the lives of those directly affected by racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance. The Special Rapporteur recalls that most of the responsibility for 
implementing such actions lies with the State, as the outcome document recognizes. National 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/racism/rapporteur/docs/Joint_Statement_SRs.pdf. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>authorities should therefore start a process of reflection, based on the clear-cut commitments 
made in the outcome document, to assess national legislation and public policies. Civil society 
also has a fundamental role to play, not only by holding Governments accountable, but also by 
participating in policymaking and implementation. 
</p>
<p>14. More specifically, the Special Rapporteur believes that concrete yardsticks are needed to 
effectively measure the implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and 
the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference and to evaluate how responsive each 
Member State has been in fulfilling its obligations under these documents. Since the changes 
needed to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance are long 
term, some concrete criteria are needed in order to evaluate the performance of States and their 
progress in achieving these commitments. International human rights mechanisms have a key 
role to play in this regard by constantly holding Member States accountable for their 
commitments and by monitoring their performance.  
</p>
<p>15. In this regard, and in view of his mandate, the Special Rapporteur will use the outcome 
document of the Durban Review Conference as a blueprint and theoretical framework for 
analysing issues relevant to his mandate during his country visits and in other regular activities. 
In particular, the Special Rapporteur analysed the commitments made by Member States under 
section 5 of the outcome document on the identification of further concrete measures and 
initiatives at all levels for combating and eliminating all manifestations of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, in order to foster the implementation of the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and to address challenges and impediments 
hereto, including in light of developments since its adoption in 2001. A list of the action-oriented 
commitments made by Member States as well as some initial indicators to monitor performance 
to meet those commitments are set out in tables (see annex). While this framework will be used 
primarily for the fulfilment of his mandate, the Special Rapporteur urges Member States to adopt 
similar approaches when assessing their domestic efforts to implement the outcome document of 
the Durban Review Conference. The Special Rapporteur also reiterates his availability to assist 
Member States meeting these commitments in a spirit of cooperation and constructive 
engagement. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  POVERTY AND RACISM 
</b></p>
<p>16. During his activities over the past year, the Special Rapporteur analysed some of the links 
between poverty and racism, including those based on the body of empirical work and country 
visits carried out in his mandate since its inception, as well as on academic and policy-oriented 
research on this topic. The Special Rapporteur is convinced that a central dimension of the fight 
against racism lies in the overlap between two key social indicators: class and race or ethnicity. 
Throughout his mandate, he intends to examine this question in depth in order to provide sound 
and policy-oriented recommendations to Member States. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s analysis in 
this section is therefore a work in progress, which will be gradually refined and expanded. 
</p>
<p>17. For many reasons, including the lack of ethnically disaggregated data collection, the links 
between race and poverty have yet to be fully elucidated. In particular, the Special Rapporteur 
recalls that there are no existing instruments for this type of data collection worldwide, which 
would allow cross-regional comparison of the levels of poverty among minorities. National data 
for many countries, however, unambiguously show that racial or ethnic minorities are </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>disproportionately affected by poverty; for example, in her report, the independent expert on 
minority issues (A/HRC/4/9) provides concrete examples of higher levels of poverty among 
Afro-descendents in Brazil; Dalits, Muslims and hill Janajatis in Nepal; British Indians, British 
African-Caribbeans, British Black Africans, British Pakistanis and British Bangladeshis in the 
United Kingdom; the San-speaking minority in Namibia; ethnic minorities in Viet Nam; 
immigrant and ethnic minorities in the European Union; and African Americans, 
American Indians and Alaska Natives and Hispanic or Latinos in the United States of America. 
There is no doubt that there is a very close association between race and poverty in most 
countries. 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur notes that the socio-economic vulnerability of minorities is 
generally the result of historic legacy, such as the impact of slavery in the American continent, 
systems of inherited status in other continents and also of systems of formalized and 
State-sponsored discrimination against minorities that were long in place in many parts of the 
world. Because of the inaction of States, the imbalances that were historically created continued 
to profoundly affect minority groups long after formalized discrimination was dismantled.  
</p>
<p>19. A number of concrete measures are needed in order to address the disproportionate levels 
of poverty of members of minorities. While the Special Rapporteur intends to analyse specific 
measures further in future reports, he will concentrate on three broad issues in the present one: 
the need for data-gathering that provides policymakers with reliable information concerning the 
socio-economic situation of minorities; the need to fully implement the obligation not to 
discriminate; and the need for special measures to redress historical imbalances. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Gathering data on poverty and race 
</b></p>
<p>20. Despite the significance of the correlation between poverty and race, the 
Special Rapporteur notes that very limited knowledge has been acquired concerning it. As 
mentioned above, one problem is the refusal of many Governments to collect ethnically 
disaggregated data, an activity that, in some situations is even prohibited by law. The reasons for 
not collecting this type of data are often grounded on legitimate concerns regarding the 
pernicious uses of such data in the past, such as during the Holocaust. However, in some 
instances, refraining from collecting ethnically disaggregated data is also a refusal to recognize 
the existence of certain minority groups within a country and the vulnerable situation those 
groups face.  
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that the lack of ethnically disaggregated data 
collection has led to an important information gap that obstructs policymaking. Without knowing 
which minority groups are more affected by poverty and lack of access to economic, social and 
cultural rights, devising specific public policies to redress these problems becomes virtually 
impossible. Lack of data means that minorities are officially &#8220;invisible&#8221; and that policies towards 
them, when existent, will be based on assumptions rather than on empirically sound information.  
</p>
<p>22. The key reason why ethnically disaggregated data are needed is the heterogeneous 
character of minority groups. Not only do these groups have different needs vis-&#224;-vis 
&#8220;majorities&#8221;, but they also differ substantially among themselves. Lack of data that inform 
policymakers of such heterogeneity will inevitably lead to sweeping &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; 
approaches directed at all minority groups alike, which are bound to fail. In order to design </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>effective policies, we need to understand the specific needs and situation of each minority group. 
While housing may be the most important problem for a certain group, employment 
discrimination could be the key issue for another. A common policy would fail to meet the 
expectations of either.  
</p>
<p>23. Some arguments against the collection of ethnically disaggregated data also allude to the 
possibility that such data would lead to further prejudice and stereotypes about the exclusion of 
certain groups. The Special Rapporteur rejects this notion. If certain groups are excluded within 
a country, it is already likely that they are victims of discrimination and subject to stereotypes. 
Data that further confirm this condition cannot be denied on the grounds that it would lead to 
further discrimination; rather, it is precisely the lack of data that would lead to less visibility and, 
probably, to more exclusion.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>24. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur would like to make reference to a particularly useful 
suggestion made by a scholar analysing the two dimensions of ethnic statistics:  
</p>
<p> (a) A right: the fundamental right to be free from racial discrimination should be 
interpreted as implying the right of the victim to obtain statistical data broken down by 
race/ethnicity, if such data would be critical evidence proving discrimination; 
</p>
<p> (b) A duty: the positive obligation of the government to ensure effective equality 
irrespective of race or ethnicity should be interpreted as including the collection, processing, 
analysis and use of impersonalized statistics disaggregated by ethnicity.<b>3</b>  
</p>
<p>25. The potential problems raised by the collection of ethnically disaggregated data, in 
particular the possibility of misuse of such data for racist and exclusionary policies, can be 
overcome by the introduction of key safeguards. The Special Rapporteur would like to note, in 
this regard, some of the principles mentioned in the outcome document of the Durban Review 
Conference: the right to privacy and the principle of self-identification (para. 104). 
</p>
<p>26. Self-identification should be a pillar of the collection of ethnically disaggregated data. This 
principle flows directly from the interpretation of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination of the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
under General Recommendation VIII, in which it states that identification as members of a 
particular racial or ethnic group should, if no justification to the contrary, be based upon 
self-identification by the individual concerned. While self-identification is not without problems 
- for example, individuals belonging to minorities may refrain from self-identifying as such for 
fear of persecution or prejudices - it is based on the important notion that the State should not 
impose an identity on the individual.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  See for example K. Ramsay, <i>Disaggregated Data Collection: A Precondition for Effective 
</i></p>

</b>  D. Petrova, &#8220;Ethnic statistics&#8221;, <i>Roma Rights: Quarterly Journal of the European Roma Rights 
</i></p>
<p><i>Centre</i>, No. 2, 2004. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>27. A key principle in the set-up of data collection programmes should also be the involvement 
of minority communities in all stages of the exercise, including design and implementation. 
Minority groups often do not have confidence in Government authorities and the uses that will 
be made of ethnically disaggregated data. By including them in the design and implementation of 
data-gathering exercises, not only will mutual confidence be built, but it will also lead to a better 
design of surveys that take into account the concerns of minorities from the onset.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Right to non-discrimination  
</b></p>
<p>28. The first obligation of States when addressing the socio-economic vulnerability of 
minorities is to implement fully the right to non-discrimination in all realms, and specifically in 
areas of economic, social and cultural rights. The right to non-discrimination is enshrined in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 
and the main international human rights instruments. As such, non-discrimination is a 
cornerstone and cross-cutting right that affects the enjoyment of all other human rights. In 
addition to international instruments, non-discrimination is considered a constitutional right in 
most legal systems. 
</p>
<p>29. Despite the robustness and overarching nature of the right to non-discrimination, the 
Special Rapporteur recalls that this obligation is still far from being fulfilled by States across the 
globe. Many forms of discrimination, including racial discrimination, are still pervasive, often 
formalized in State policies and legislation. Such cases have been the subject of attention by the 
mandate of the Special Rapporteur since its inception. 
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur has previously reported on the unequal provision of economic, 
social and cultural rights to minority groups. Some key examples include health installations, 
such as hospitals and clinics, as well as water pipelines and other projects that have been 
deliberately excluded from geographic regions that are predominantly inhabited by minority and 
indigenous groups; members of minority groups are unable to have access to medical services 
because of administrative measures and regulations that demand official authorization from 
Government officials for travel outside certain areas; and persons arbitrarily deprived of their 
nationality were denied access to health care and basic medical treatment.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>31. Discrimination on the provision of the right to education has also contributed to 
perpetuating imbalances among members of minorities. Clear examples of this form of 
discrimination include authorities refusing to issue identity documents to members of certain 
ethnic minorities, preventing them from attending school or university;<b>5</b> students from ethnic 
minority or lower castes being prevented by schoolteachers from attending school;<b>6</b> lack of  
</p>
<p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>official recognition of minority schools, in turn leading to barriers to the eligibility of students 
from minority schools for university;<b>7</b> and the absence of reference to minority or indigenous 
culture and history in school curricula.<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>32. Similar examples abound in other areas, such as housing, employment, access to justice 
and relations with law enforcement. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur recalls that the 
prohibition of non-discrimination has two main dimensions: not only banning non-discrimination 
itself, which would be required in the examples described above, but also prohibiting policies 
and actions that are prima facie non-discriminatory, but which in practice have discriminatory 
effects. Such effects can arise from the discriminatory application of otherwise race-neutral 
measures or the design of seemingly race-neutral measures that in fact have a disproportionate 
impact on the situation of minorities. 
</p>
<p>33. A clear example of non-discriminatory policies with a disproportionate impact on 
minorities relates to drug enforcement actions. In many countries, there is a large gap between 
the distribution of drug users among the general population and the distribution of persons 
convicted of drug offences, which is heavily skewed towards minorities. This generally indicates 
that drug policies, though non-discriminatory in practice, are implemented in a discriminatory 
manner that targets minorities, such as by a heavier police presence in areas predominantly 
inhabited by minorities. 
</p>
<p>34. In other instances, even when the application of a given policy is race-neutral, its design 
may lead to a disproportionate impact on minorities; for example, different sanctions are 
foreseen for drugs that have similar psychotropic and physiological effects. The classic example 
is that between crack cocaine and powder cocaine; due to its cheaper price, crack is more widely 
consumed by members of minorities. Therefore a disparity in sentences, with longer sanctions 
for crack consumption, also tends to disproportionately affect such minorities.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>35. With regard to the promotion of non-discrimination, the Special Rapporteur welcomes in 
particular the general recommendation on non-discrimination currently being drafted by the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. This broader and overarching general 
comment will further complement the work of the Committee on non-discrimination for specific 
rights, such as housing (general comments No. 4 and 7), food (general comment No. 12), 
education (general comment No. 13), health (general comment No. 14), water (general comment 
No. 15), work (general comment No. 18) and social security (general comment No. 19). As such, 
it will provide more clarity and precision for policymakers. However, the Special Rapporteur 
would like to stress that most cases of discrimination occur in clear-cut realms of the law and are 
therefore caused not by ambiguous assessment of a State&#8217;s obligations, but rather by explicit 
policies targeting minorities.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Special measures to correct historical imbalances 
</b></p>
<p>36. Non-discrimination is essential to create a level playing field and to prevent the repetition 
of past mistakes that created large imbalances. The Special Rapporteur notes, however, that 
because of the historical legacies of racism in most parts of the world, simply implementing the 
right to non-discrimination will not help redress the large disparities created over the course of 
decades or centuries of discrimination; rather, they will simply maintain the current gap between 
minorities and majorities. Specific actions are therefore needed to redress these historical 
imbalances in order to promote real equality to minorities. The Special Rapporteur recalls that 
the need for such special measures has already been affirmed by article 1.4 of the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.<b>10</b>   
</p>
<p>37. While the Special Rapporteur recalls the caveat established by the Convention regarding 
the temporary character of such special measures, he is concerned at the recent trend in many 
parts of the world of the retreating from and dismantling of such measures before the goals of 
integration have been attained.  
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur recalls three main reasons why such special measures are needed 
and indeed beneficial. First, they are designed to correct historical injustices and remedy past 
damage, such as slavery, segregation or apartheid. Affirmative action helps correct the 
present-day legacy of these historical events. Second, special measures in areas such as schools 
help improve the quality of education, particularly for those pupils that have left segregated 
schools and joined integrated ones. Sociological and pedagogical studies have indeed shown that 
more integrated schools have a better overall academic performance than more segregated ones. 
Finally, integrated schools and workplaces help foster democratic culture in pluralistic societies, 
establishing different degrees of cooperation and interaction among people of diverse racial or 
ethnic backgrounds.<b>11</b>  
</p>
<p>39. One of the key difficulties in overcoming racism and discrimination is the lack of 
interaction and everyday relations among different racial or ethnic groups. By correcting these 
historical distortions, special measures such as affirmative action help build a more solid and 
democratic society, in which different groups cooperate on a regular basis. In this regard, they 
help create the most solid defence against future forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance.

freedoms shall not be deemed racial discrimination, provided, however, that such measures do

<p><b>IV.  ACTIVITIES OF THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Visits by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>40. Upon taking up his functions on 1 August 2008, the Special Rapporteur made requests to 
visit a number of countries. He also renewed requests for country visits that had been made by 
his predecessor. In the planning and undertaking of country visits, the Special Rapporteur takes 
into account the underlying principle that racism is a universal problem with global implications 
and therefore considers the importance of achieving geographical balance and of addressing a 
wide range of situations of concern to his mandate. 
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur is particularly pleased to have received positive responses from the 
Governments of Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Germany and the United Arab Emirates. The 
Special Rapporteur believes that the very act of inviting a mandate holder for a country visit is an 
expression of the State&#8217;s willingness and commitment to fighting racism and to engage in a 
constructive dialogue with the mandate holder. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur is pleased 
that he will carry out visits to Germany in June 2009 and to the United Arab Emirates in 
October 2009. Reports on those visits will be presented to the Council in 2010. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Other activities of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>42. On 24 and 25 August 2008, the Special Rapporteur attended the Africa Regional 
Preparatory Meeting for the Durban Review Conference, held in Abuja. The Meeting was 
attended by Member States and civil society from Africa in order to draft a common position 
with regard to the Durban Review Conference. In his remarks, the Special Rapporteur 
highlighted that racism, xenophobia and intolerance were universal problems of global reach. 
The common recognition of racism as a fundamental problem of the present time was the first 
step in mounting the fight against it. The collective experience in the fight against racism had 
shown that no society was free from the scourge of racism. In such a context, the only possible 
response to a truly global problem lay in concerted international action at all levels. The Special 
Rapporteur further noted that the past international conferences against racism, including the 
Durban Conference in 2001, allowed for the creation of a solid legal framework in international 
law that not only prohibited racism, but pointed to concrete ways to overcome it. He further 
observed that the outcome document produced at Durban could undoubtedly be regarded as the 
most comprehensive and ambitious international effort ever made in the fight against racism. He 
concluded by noting that the Durban Review Conference, and in particular the Africa Regional 
Meeting, was a unique opportunity for a renewed engagement and expression of unrelenting 
political will to promote the fight against racism and to implement the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action. 
</p>
<p>43. On 6 October 2008, the Special Rapporteur addressed the Preparatory Committee of the 
Durban Review Conference at its second substantive session, which met in Geneva. The Special 
Rapporteur praised the breadth and ambition of the Durban Declaration and Programme of 
Action, which was a beacon of hope for those working against all forms of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. He added that the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action identified clearly the key international, regional and national strategies that 
had to be implemented to redress historical wrongs and current injustices. The Special 
Rapporteur noted, however, that the unprecedented framework established by the Durban </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Declaration and Programme of Action had yet to be fully implemented around the world. The 
Review Conference was therefore a unique chance to redress these serious implementation gaps, 
to consolidate effective strategies to achieve the ambitious goals set out in the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action, and to rebuild the strong international consensus that was 
shaped in Durban in the fight against all forms of racism. 
</p>
<p>44. On 12 November 2008, the Special Rapporteur, at the invitation of the Council of Europe, 
attended the Conference on Human Rights in Culturally Diverse Societies, held in The Hague. In 
his intervention, the Special Rapporteur focused on issues related to hate speech and incitement 
to racial hatred. He explained that discussions over hate speech, and how to balance prohibitions 
thereof with freedom of expression, currently lay at the centre of debates in the United Nations 
human rights system. He noted that this debate had developed around the notion of &#8220;defamation 
of religions&#8221;, put forward for the first time in the Commission of Human Rights in 1999. After 
highlighting some key aspects of the debate, the Special Rapporteur noted that the debate at the 
international level was moving from the concept of &#8220;defamation of religions&#8221; to the existing 
legal notion of &#8220;advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to 
discrimination, hostility and violence&#8221;, which was considered a positive shift, as it helped better 
understand the existing legal obligations of States. The Special Rapporteur also addressed some 
technical and legal issues involved in the application of incitement laws, including their 
threshold of application, the need for contextualized information and case-by-case analysis and 
some of the criteria needed when applying such laws. The Special Rapporteur made reference, in 
particular, to the expert seminar organized by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights in October 2008. To conclude, he also highlighted that a much broader set of policy 
measures were necessary, particularly at the domestic level, to eliminate the root causes of 
racism. 
</p>
<p>45. On 21 January 2009, the Special Rapporteur participated in a seminar on the prevention of 
genocide, chaired in Geneva by the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, 
Francis Deng. Apart from co-signing a statement delivered by several mandate holders, the 
Special Rapporteur focused on explaining how racism and genocide were connected. He stated 
that genocide, ethnic cleansing and other war crimes had been traditionally linked to the 
emergence of exclusionary ideologies based on race or ethnicity. For example, the actions 
perpetrated by those guided by Nazi or Hutu power ideology showed how extreme forms of 
racism, often hidden behind the guise of radical nationalism, could lead to unspeakable 
catastrophes. The Special Rapporteur praised the work carried out by the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination on issues related to genocide, combining both a focus on 
long-term and short-term factors and root causes with more immediate factors that could trigger 
mass violence at particular times. Understanding these factors could lead to a more robust 
response by the international community. The Special Rapporteur added that an anti-racism and 
anti-discrimination approach was thus essential in post-conflict situations, particularly in 
post-genocide contexts, to ensure that such tragedies would not recur. In particular, the racial or 
ethnic fractions that opened during conflict had to be addressed, such as with broad programmes 
of national reconciliation that foster inter-ethnic cooperation. While the easier short-term fixes 
could sometimes point to virtual separation among ethnic groups (such as by the creation of 
ethnically-defined political parties), the only lasting solutions were those that build bridges 
among communities and allow them to identify with a common future. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>46. On 23 January 2009, the Special Rapporteur participated in the Wilton Park Conference on 
Contemporary and Future Human Rights Challenges, held in West Sussex, United Kingdom. At 
the conference, he addressed some substantive aspects of the Durban Review Conference and its 
centrality in the fight against racism. In particular, he addressed the possible implications of the 
financial crisis for the fight against racism. The Special Rapporteur stated that, with soaring 
unemployment and decreasing salaries, some groups might try to manipulate public opinion to 
generate a strong anti-immigration backlash and to blame migrants for current economic 
problems. These xenophobic expressions were at times intertwined with racial prejudice and 
stereotypes, as migrants could often be differentiated based on their race or ethnicity. The 
Special Rapporteur also addressed the issue of the overlap between poverty and race. He stated 
that, in many areas, owing to historical legacies and present discrimination, one could quickly 
identify that the poorest segments of the population were disproportionately composed of racial 
or ethnic minorities. This structural situation posed numerous challenges to the promotion of 
equality. Poverty created a vicious circle for members of a minority: lack of education, 
adequate housing and health care transmitted poverty from generation to generation, and 
perpetuated racial prejudices and stereotypes towards them. Breaking with the double trap of 
racism and poverty was therefore an essential requirement to the promotion of equality and 
non-discrimination. 
</p>
<p>47. On 19 March 2009, the Special Rapporteur participated in a high-level panel to celebrate 
the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. He recalled that the 
International Day was particularly meaningful in 2009 in view of the Durban Review 
Conference, scheduled to be held only a month later. The Special Rapporteur also highlighted a 
number of substantive issues, including the dual impact that the financial crisis would have on 
minorities, with devastating consequences for their socio-economic vulnerability. Just like 
others, minorities would suffer from decreasing wages, increasing unemployment and, even 
more critical, lower standards of living. In addition, they were also more vulnerable to many 
expressions of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, which could 
take the form of increased intolerance of foreigners, particularly migrants. In the current context, 
the positive contribution of migrants to economic growth, social interaction and cultural diversity 
tended to be forgotten. Rather, migrants were more likely to be seen as competitors for scarce 
jobs and social services. Political parties were often ready to capitalize on these fears for political 
ends. Racist and xenophobic political platforms were still widespread, attesting to our collective 
failure to combat racism effectively. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>48.<b> The Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and the outcome document of the 
Durban Review Conference provide the most comprehensive frameworks for the fight 
against racism. The main challenge lies in the implementation of these two documents. The 
Special Rapporteur strongly recommends that Member States formally establish specific 
implementation mechanisms that will allow for adequate implementation of the pledges 
that they made in the Durban Review Conference. In particular, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that Member States adopt concrete targets and yardsticks for the 
implementation of the outcome document. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>49.<b> The Special Rapporteur strongly recommends that the countries that did not 
participate in the Durban Review Conference publicly acknowledge their support for its 
outcome document and commit to its implementation. 
</b></p>
<p>50.<b> With regard to the issue of incitement to racial or religious hatred, the Special 
Rapporteur recommends that the constructive agreement reached in the outcome 
document of the Durban Review Conference be seen as the basis for further understanding 
of the thresholds established by article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and article 4 of the International Convention for the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination, including in the series of regional seminars that will be 
organized by OHCHR.  
</b></p>
<p>51.<b> The Special Rapporteur invites Member States to adopt a comprehensive approach to 
tackle the problems related to the overlap of poverty and race or ethnicity prevalent 
around the world. In particular, the Special Rapporteur recommends that Member States 
review and redesign policies and programmes that may have a disproportionate effect on 
racial or ethnic minorities in view of their socio-economic vulnerability, and implement 
effective measures to improve the access of such groups to civil, cultural, economic, 
political and social rights. 
</b></p>
<p>52.<b> As a key prerequisite of any action aimed at tackling the socio-economic vulnerability 
of persons belonging to ethnic or racial minorities, the Special Rapporteur recommends 
that States collect ethnically disaggregated data and indicators that allow for the 
identification of the main problems these groups face and inform policymaking in this 
regard. The principles of privacy, self-identification and involvement of all communities in 
such data-gathering activities should be respected at all times. 
</b></p>
<p>53.<b> The Special Rapporteur recalls the overarching and cornerstone prohibition of 
discrimination on national, racial, ethnic or religious grounds according to international 
human rights law, and strongly recommends that States review legislation and policies that 
may directly or indirectly discriminate against particular groups. 
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>In order to redress the historical imbalances created by racism and discrimination, 
including slavery, segregation, apartheid and other forms of exclusion, the Special 
Rapporteur recommends that Member States take special measures to foster integration of 
racial or ethnic minorities into education, health, housing, the workplace and other areas.</b>
