magnetite concentrate at Karara, a decrease of 9.3% over March 2016 Quarter production of 1.788 million 
WMT. The decrease in concentrate is due to planned and unplanned maintenance of the crushing circuit

approximately 1.52 million WMT of magnetite concentrate. 
 
Magnetite production grade quality during the June 2016 Quarter averaged 65.4% Fe.

JUNE 2016 QUARTERLY REPORT
For the June 2016 Quarter, average magnetite C1 unit cash cost (mining, processing, maintenance, rail, 
port  and  site  administration  excluding  depreciation  and  amortisation,  corporate  administration,  sale, 
royalties, ocean freight, interest and financing costs) was approximately USD(1) $ 63 per WMT (March 
2016 Quarter: approximately USD $58 per WMT). The increase in the C1 unit cash costs is due to lower 
concentrate production and higher strip ratio during the quarter.  
 
KML continues to focus on reduction of its production costs amid continuing volatility of iron ore prices. 
 
Sales

Fe)  adjusted  for  its  higher  iron  grade  relative  to  the  benchmark  (June  2016  Quarter  –  average  of 
approximately 65.3% Fe) plus a premium for the greater value in use of magnetite concentrate (2) (June 
2016  Quarter  –  average  of  approximately  USD  $0.85  per  WMT;  March  2016  Quarter:  average  of 
approximately USD $0.7 per WMT) less a penalty for impurities.
