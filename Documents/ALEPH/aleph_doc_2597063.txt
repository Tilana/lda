Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of
Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(b) On August 23, 2016, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (the “Company”) announced that Mr.
James J. Kleckner, Executive Vice President, International and Deepwater Operations, will leave
the Company effective September 1, 2016 and Mr. Robert P. Daniels, Executive Vice President,
International and Deepwater Exploration, will retire effective December 2, 2016. Mr. Daniels will
continue in an advisory role as Executive Vice President until his retirement. The press release
has been filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Report and is incorporated by reference herein.
(e) As approved by the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company on August 22, 2016, Mr.
Kleckner will be eligible for benefits under the Company’s Officer Severance Plan, subject to
executing a Termination Agreement and Release of all Claims (the “Termination Agreement”),
which includes a release of all claims related to Mr. Kleckner’s employment with and separation
from the Company. Under the terms of the Termination Agreement, and upon the Termination
Agreement becoming irrevocable, Mr. Kleckner will receive (i) a payment equal to two times his
annual base salary plus one year’s target bonus under the Company’s Annual Incentive Program
(“AIP”) ($1,843,750 in the aggregate, less applicable taxes), (ii) a pro-rata bonus under the AIP
for calendar year 2016, which will be payable at the end of the performance period based on the
actual performance score approved by the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board
for executive officers of the Company for calendar year 2016, and (iii) if elected by Mr. Kleckner,
medical, dental and vision coverage for Mr. Kleckner and his eligible dependents at the active
employee rate for six months. In addition, effective as of September 1, 2016, the Board will
accelerate the vesting of 81,726 stock options previously granted to Mr. Kleckner under the
Company’s 2012 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan and Mr. Kleckner will have 36 months
from the date of termination to exercise such options, unless the options expire earlier by their
own terms. The Termination Agreement also includes certain commitments by Mr. Kleckner,
including non-disclosure, non-disparagement and non-solicitation provisions (each in
compliance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission).
In addition to the benefits payable pursuant to the Officer’s Severance Plan and other accrued
retirement benefits, Mr. Kleckner will receive approximately $647,000 of additional benefits
related to the Company’s supplemental pension benefits under the terms of the Kerr-McGee
Corporation Retirement Plan. Further, pursuant to the terms of the applicable award agreements,
Mr. Kleckner’s outstanding restricted stock units will vest upon termination and be paid in shares
of common stock, together with any accrued dividend equivalents, six months after the
termination date and his outstanding performance units shall be payable in cash at the end of the
performance period based on the Company’s actual performance.
The foregoing summary of the Termination Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to
the full text of the form of Termination Agreement and Release of all Claims, which is attached
hereto as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated in this Item 5.02 by
