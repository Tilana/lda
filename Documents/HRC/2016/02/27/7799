<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its sixteenth session from 
22 April to 3 May 2013. The review of Azerbaijan was held at the 14th meeting on 30 April 
</p><p>2013. The delegation of Azerbaijan was headed by Khalaf Khalafov, Deputy Minister of 
Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Azerbaijan. At its 17th meeting held on 02 May 2013, 
the Working Group adopted the report on Azerbaijan. 
</p>
<p>2. On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Azerbaijan: Libya, Maldives and Peru. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to Human Rights Council resolution 
5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued 
for the review of Azerbaijan: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/16/AZE/1); 
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/16/AZE/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/16/AZE/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Armenia, Ireland, Mexico, Montenegro, 
the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland was transmitted to Azerbaijan through the troika. These questions are 
available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The head of the Azerbaijani delegation stated that Azerbaijan highly appreciated the 
contribution of the Human Rights Council and the universal periodic review to the 
promotion and protection of the human rights and fundamental freedoms. He reiterated 
Azerbaijan&#8217;s openness and willingness towards comprehensive cooperation with the 
Council and its mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>6. Azerbaijan emphasized that the guarantee of human rights and freedoms is 
proclaimed as the highest goal of the State in the Constitution of Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan is 
a party to the fundamental international human rights treaties. According to article 148 of 
the Constitution, the international treaties to which Azerbaijan is a party constitute an 
integral part of Azerbaijan&#8217;s legislative system, and article 151 states that in case of a 
possible contradiction between normative legal acts of Azerbaijan and the international 
treaties to which Azerbaijan is a party, the provisions of international treaties shall apply. 
Human rights and freedoms have direct force in Azerbaijan. In the framework of current 
trends in international relations, the promotion and protection of human rights are provided 
on the basis of the supremacy of international law. In this connection, Azerbaijan stressed 
the occupation of 20 per cent of Azerbaijan&#8217;s territory by the Republic of Armenia, </p>


<p>including the Nagorno-Karabakh1 region and seven adjacent districts, and the unresolved 
state of the conflict.2 The head of delegation, Mr. Khalafov, stated that all the remarks 
contained in the statement on the conflict were related to the realization of human rights 
within the whole territory of Azerbaijan, the territorial integrity of which has been violated 
by Armenia. He stated that the conflict has had grave consequences to date, and represented 
one of the major obstacles3 to the protection of human rights in the country. In the course of 
the armed aggression, the Armenian side committed grave violations of international 
humanitarian law, including numerous killings and extrajudicial executions of Azerbaijani 
civilians, hostages and prisoners of war, and use of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment. Azerbaijan noted that the national report contained more detailed 
information regarding the fact that almost one million of its people became refugees and 
internally displaced persons (IDPs) as a result of the policy of ethnic cleansing4 by the 
Republic of Armenia. Mr. Khalafov further stated that such behaviour by Armenia was not 
a surprise, and that it was aimed at disrupting the review of Azerbaijan. 
</p>
<p>7. Azerbaijan conducts ongoing cooperation with the special procedures, which will be  
continued. Azerbaijan has been receiving visits by special procedures mandate holders. The 
latest visit was by the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the 
highest attainable standard of physical and mental health from 16 to 23 May 2012. 
Azerbaijan also highlighted that it had already extended a standing invitation to all special 
procedures mandate holders. 
</p>
<p>8. Azerbaijan mentioned that the National Action Programme on raising the efficiency 
of human rights protection was adopted in 2011. It covers the issues reflected in the 
recommendations addressed to Azerbaijan during the first UPR. It also envisages such 
issues as improvement of the normative legal basis, including through the definition of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms as a major criterion for drafting laws, improving 
the activities of State agencies, training, research and awareness-raising measures on human 
rights and cooperation with international organizations in the field of human rights. 
</p>
<p>9. Azerbaijan stated that it had joined the Open Government Partnership in 2011 with a 
view to raising transparency and promoting open Government practices, exchanging 
</p>
<p>  
 1 In accordance with General Assembly resolution 62/243, entitled &#8220;The situation in the occupied 
</p>
<p>territories of Azerbaijan&#8221;, references to &#8220;Nagorno-Karabakh&#8221; in the present report should read as &#8220;the 
Nagorno-Karabakh region of the Republic of Azerbaijan.&#8221;  
</p>
<p> 2 Armenia requested the President remind the delegation of Azerbaijan that it should only use accepted 
language in the United Nations. Armenia requested the President to disregard the allegations made 
against Armenia and not to include them in the report of the Working Group. In response, the 
President reminded all delegations that, as per rule 113 of the rules of procedure, a point of order 
should focus on procedural matters. He stated that debating on territorial issues was a substantive 
exercise, and those issues would be more appropriately dealt with in other fora. He further stated that 
the UPR Working Group was not the competent body to discuss issues of a political or territorial 
nature. Consequently, the President invited all delegations to focus on human rights issues in the 
context of their statements. He reiterated that all States were entitled to their views and asked that 
these be voiced in a respectful and dignified manner. The President appealed to all concerned to 
refrain from using the UPR to deal with bilateral issues as this would ultimately undermine the 
principles of universality and the goals of the mechanism. 
</p>
<p> 3 With respect to Armenia&#8217;s request for a point of order, the President reminded the meeting that States 
that are not members of the Council may raise points of order under rule 113, but cannot appeal the 
ruling of the President. 
</p>
<p> 4 With respect to Armenia&#8217;s further request for a point of order, the President again reminded the 
meeting that States that are not members of the Council may raise points of order under rule 113, but 
cannot appeal the ruling of the President. The President further urged the delegation of Armenia to 
refrain from these reactions. </p>


<p>positive international experience and contributing to global efforts in the field. The National 
Action Plan 2012-2015 on promotion of the open Government was adopted. 
</p>
<p>10. Azerbaijan noted that, in consideration of the need to raise transparency in the 
activities of State bodies, the State Agency on Services for Citizens and Social Innovations 
(ASAN) was established to provide citizens with quality services using innovative methods; 
to adhere to the norms of ethics and politeness in communications with citizens; to address 
the needs and queries of citizens, to improve the services provided by State bodies; and to 
speed up the transition to E-services. A special ASAN Service was established within this 
Agency. Nine State bodies (Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of 
Taxes, State Committee on Property, State Customs Committee, State Migration Service, 
State Committee on Land and Cartography, State Social Protection Fund and the National 
Archive Department) offer 25 types of services via ASAN service centres. The centres 
facilitate a wider use of E-services, help to cut costs for citizens and enable them to save 
time, build trust for the State bodies, enhance transparency and contribute to the fight 
against corruption. 
</p>
<p>11. Azerbaijan stated that the Law on Freedom of Assembly of 1998 was amended in 
2008 taking due account of the opinion of the Venice Commission of the Council of 
Europe. In its opinion, the Venice Commission confirmed that, after the introduction of 
additions and amendments, the Law corresponded fully to European standards. The basic 
principles of and rules for the realization of the freedom of assembly are defined. The 
relevant provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 
European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as 
well as the principles established in the Precedent Law of the European Court on Human 
Rights have been taken into full consideration in this Law. 
</p>
<p>12. Azerbaijan also stated that large-scale reforms have been conducted in the justice 
system. For the first time in the history of the country, administrative economic courts have 
been established in seven regions, and the military court system was also been reformed. 
The number of judges doubled during the reporting period. The results of the judicial 
reforms attracted the attention of leading international bodies. In particular, the European 
Commission for the Efficiency of Justice (CEPEJ) described Azerbaijan&#8217;s experience as a 
model of success. 
</p>

</p>
<p>48. On the issue of judicial reform, Azerbaijan recalled that two independent bodies had 
been established to manage judicial proceedings, namely the Judicial Council, an 
independent body responsible for all issues relating to the administration of justice; and the 
Committee to select judges. In recent years, the number of judges has doubled. The judge 
selection process has been accepted by the Council of Europe and is considered a model for 
other countries. 
</p>
<p>49. As of 2011, Administrative Courts were established to ensure the independence of 
the new judicial bodies. These were created according to the principle of the regional 
courts, and their activities have proven to be very effective. Statistics related to these courts 
indicate that 75 to 80 per cent of complaints lodged by citizens on the violations of their 
rights by officials and/or by civil servants have been found to be unfounded by these 
Administrative Courts. Moreover, great attention has been paid in recent years to increasing 
the salaries of judges, which have been raised some thirty-fold over the last few years. 
</p>
<p>50. Furthermore, Azerbaijan intends to improve the juvenile justice system. Azerbaijan 
has been working in cooperation with the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) on a 
draft law on juvenile justice for some time and expects to achieve a positive outcome in the 
near future. 
</p>
<p>51. On the issue of freedom and independence of NGOs, Azerbaijan highlighted that 
freedom of association is one of the key human rights recognized by the Constitution.  
Some 3,000 NGOs are currently registered in the country and there has been a stable 
growth in the number of NGOs registered over the last five years with 20 per cent 
additional NGOs registered each year. Regarding legislation regulating NGO registration, it  
is possible for NGOs to work without registering. However, NGOs that wish to receive a 
legal status must submit a request for registration to the Ministry of Justice. In fact, there 
are no restrictions on the registration of NGOs. Azerbaijan added that amendments and </p>


<p>modifications regarding transparency and financial activities had been made to the law on 
registration so as to improve the activities of NGOs. 
</p>
<p>52. Referring to allegations that the Ministry of Justice had attempted to close down 
NGOs, it was noted that in the course of the last 12 years, the Ministry of Justice had 
approached the Court in only about four cases to request that NGOs be closed down. All of 
these instances took place in response to grave violations of Azerbaijan&#8217;s legislation. Over 
300 NGOs are currently working successfully with no restrictions in the area of human 
rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>53. In response to questions regarding conditions of detention and living conditions in 
prisons, Azerbaijan stated that great efforts have been made to modernize the infrastructure 
of the penitentiary system. In several regions of Azerbaijan, new penitentiary 
establishments have been built, legislation has been amended to improve detention 
conditions of detainees and increase their rights. Furthermore, based on a partnership 
agreement with the World Bank, Azerbaijan is working to improve the whole infrastructure 
of the judiciary. Some 20 new buildings for the judiciary will be built in the near future. 
Furthermore, over the last two years, eight new court buildings have been built and modern 
technology, such as the Internet, has been made available to the whole judicial system.  
Citizens can now find out what kinds of hearings are going to be heard by whom, as well as 
all the necessary information through the Internet. 
</p>
<p>54. Concerning freedom of assembly, Azerbaijan stated that the amendments adopted in 
2009 to the law on freedom of assembly had been prepared together with the Venice 
Commission of the Council of Europe. It added that the Commission considered that the 
final text of the law was fully in compliance with European standards in this field. The law 
takes into account the full range of the principles and norms of international law and case 
law of the European Court of Human Rights on the protection of freedom of assembly. 
</p>
<p>55. Azerbaijan also mentioned reference by one delegation to restrictions on freedom of 
assembly, in particular a local authorities&#8217; refusal to allow a demonstration to be held in the 
capital. It explained that the law provides for demonstrations to be held in certain specific 
places, which are published by the local authorities, as well as for the possibility of filing 
complaints and appealing decisions. It noted that none of the decisions by local authorities 
had been appealed. 
</p>
<p>56. Concerning the defamation law, the legislation of Azerbaijan is in full compliance 
with international standards. An analysis carried out of similar laws in European states 
found that sanctions provided for in the Criminal Code of Azerbaijan are in line with 
similar sanctions in other member states of the Council of Europe. There are still some 
deficiencies in the practical approach of the judiciary in the interpretation of the said law. It 
has therefore been decided to propose a draft text for a new law which will comprise all 
relevant international principles and the case law of the European Court of Human Rights. 
The draft text was submitted to the Venice Commission last year and comments on the text 
are expected soon. 
</p>
<p>57. Azerbaijan also highlighted that a new law had been adopted on the rights and 
freedoms of persons in prison and pretrial detention. This is an important step in the fight 
against ill-treatment in places of pretrial detention, as it incorporates many principles of 
international instruments, in particular minimum standard rules on the treatment of 
prisoners. 
</p>
<p>58. Azerbaijan provided detailed information on the presidential election scheduled to 
take place at the end of this year. It noted that relevant bodies are carrying out different 
projects in preparation for the forthcoming elections, including educating the different 
electoral actors, such as voters, co-workers, observers, mass media, among others. It 
stressed the participation of national and international observers in the process and provided </p>


<p>further details regarding, inter alia, the campaign process and the action of the electoral and 
local authorities. Azerbaijan also highlighted cooperation with international organizations, 
such as the Council of Europe, the Office for Democratic Institutions in Human Rights 
(ODIHR) of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and stressed 
that there was a very strong political will on the part of the Government to ensure free and 
fair elections. 
</p>
<p>59. Kazakhstan noted Azerbaijan&#8217;s close work with the treaty bodies and its ratification 
of several international conventions. It recognized the efforts to secure conditions for the 
right of freedom of religion and the registration of 730 religious communities. 
</p>
<p>60. Libya acknowledged the adoption of the National Action Programme and welcomed 
Azerbaijan&#8217;s accession to United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO) conventions, implementation of international obligations and ratification of 
CRPD and OP-CAT. It expressed hope for progress with regard to freedom of expression 
and for detainees. 
</p>
<p>61. Malaysia noted Azerbaijan&#8217;s emphasis on education, health, women and children. It 
welcomed the reform and improvement of the judicial and legal system, noted the National 
Action Programme and commended the efforts to focus on human rights training and 
education. 
</p>
<p>62. Mauritania welcomed Azerbaijan&#8217;s efforts to combat violence against women and

international obligations in the field of economic, social and political rights. 
</p>
<p>63. Mexico praised the adoption of OP-CAT and commended the adoption of laws to 
punish domestic violence and protect the rights of detainees. It noted the presidential 
electoral process to be held this year. 
</p>
<p>64. Montenegro commended Azerbaijan&#8217;s accession to international human rights 
instruments and encouraged it to address the findings of the Special Rapporteur on health. It 
noted that Azerbaijan had not replied to the letter sent by the Special Rapporteur on the 
rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association and requested information on 
steps taken to revise the 2009 law and ensure compliance with international human rights 
law. 
</p>
<p>65. Morocco saluted the adoption of the National Action Programme, which defines 
responsibility for achieving objectives and includes follow-up to the UPR 
recommendations, and identified it as a good practice. It welcomed Azerbaijan&#8217;s promotion 
of human rights education and training.  
</p>
<p>66. Myanmar commended the measures taken to implement the accepted

on the ratification of several international human rights instruments. 
</p>
<p>101. Azerbaijan noted that many problems regarding the implementation of the laws were 
linked to the conflict, which resulted in many refugees and IDPs.  For over ten years, all 
social divisions as well as all economic and social assistance for the refugees and IDPs have 
fallen purely on the shoulders of the Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan 
has tried to ensure their integration in society and social and economic assistance. Only 
once all the occupied territories are freed will all the refugees and IDPs be able to return 
safely to their homes.  
</p>
<p>102. It added that the issues raised, such as violence against women, freedom of assembly 
and association, international standards for the work of the mass media and freedom of 
association were all priorities for the Government. A great deal of effort has been made on 
human rights education, in particular training officials. 
</p>
<p>103. Azerbaijan recalled that it is party to practically all the international human rights 
instruments and that pursuant to its obligations, these instruments automatically become an 
integral part of domestic legislation. Many court rulings are now based directly on

fields of health and education.

and announced that it had issued a standing invitation to all special procedures mandate 
holders. </p>


<p>106. It noted that immigration was an issue and that efforts are being made to address it, 
particularly by bringing legislation in line with international standards, working with 
countries in Europe and cooperating with countries of origin. Azerbaijan highlighted that it  
was an open society and that it strives to create conducive conditions for people to visit the 
country. 
</p>
<p>107. In conclusion, Azerbaijan regretted that the Republic of Armenia had used this 
forum to tarnish the image and reputation of Azerbaijan. On the issue of self-determination 
of the Armenian minority, Azerbaijan expressed its view that international law does not 
allow for the Armenian minority to use the right to self-determination as a pretext for 
creating its own state. It stated that the issue of self-determination was a pretext to try to 
cover up aggression against Azerbaijan and the occupation of 20 per cent of Azerbaijan&#8217;s 
territory. 
</p>
<p>108. Azerbaijan further stated that Armenia was not only laying claim to the territory of 
Azerbaijan, but also the territory of other neighbours, which would lead to its isolation in 
the region. Therefore, Armenia is leaving itself out of the development process in the 
region, although major projects have been implemented in the Southern caucuses. 
Azerbaijan reiterated that Armenia was putting itself on the sidelines.
