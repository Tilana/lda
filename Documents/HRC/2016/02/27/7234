</p>
<p>Chair of the Working Group, Mireille Fanon Mend&#232;s-France, Verene Shepherd and Sabelo 
</p>
<p>Gumedze (appointed on 27 June 2014), as the formal appointment of two new members 
</p>

</p>
<p>session was attended by all members of the Working Group, including the two new 
</p>
<p>members. The present report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>resolutions 9/14, 18/28 and 27/25, in which the Working Group was requested to submit an 
</p>
<p>annual report to the Council on all activities relating to its mandate. 
</p>
<p>2. Representatives of Member States, the Holy See, international organizations, 
</p>
<p>regional organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and invited panellists 
</p>
<p>participated in the session of the Working Group (see annex II). 
</p>
<p><b> II. Organization of the sixteenth session 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Opening of the session 
</b></p>
<p>3. Ms. Fanon Mend&#232;s-France opened the session and welcomed all participants. In 
</p>
<p>particular she welcomed the three new members of the Working Group, Mr. Gumedze, 
</p>
<p>Mr. Balcerzak and Mr. Sunga.  
</p>
<p>4. The Chief of the Anti-Racial Discrimination Section of the Office of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), Yury Boychenko, delivered the 
</p>
<p>opening statement of the session, and informed the meeting that the High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>would deliver his statement to the session on 1 April 2015. In his opening statement, Mr. 
</p>
<p>Boychenko highlighted the important role of the Working Group in bringing focus to the 
</p>
<p>multiple challenges faced by people of African descent in the enjoyment of the right to 
</p>
<p>development, and in submitting important recommendations for States Members of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations and civil society at large on ways to address the protection of their human 
</p>
<p>rights. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Election of the Chair-Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>5. Ms. Fanon Mend&#232;s-France was re-elected Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>The Chair thanked the other members of the Working Group and the participants for their 
</p>
<p>support and added that the Working Group would continue to strive to strengthen the 
</p>
<p>mandate that had been entrusted to it. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Organization of work 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Working Group adopted the agenda (see annex I) and programme of work.  </p>


<p><b> III. Update and briefings on activities undertaken by the 
Working Group in the past year 
</b></p>
<p>7. Under item 5 of the agenda, Ms. Fanon Mend&#232;s-France informed participants that on 
</p>
<p>3 November 2014 she had attended a meeting of the Third Committee of the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly in New York and presented the activities of the Working Group, including an 
</p>
<p>overview of discussions and conclusions from its annual meetings, findings from country 
</p>
<p>fact-finding visits, action taken under the communication procedure and work relating to 
</p>
<p>the International Decade for People of African Descent. An interactive dialogue at the end 
</p>
<p>of her presentation had received broad support from members of the Committee for the 
</p>
<p>work of the Working Group.  
</p>
<p>8. Ms. Fanon Mend&#232;s-France also briefed the participants of the sixteenth session on 
</p>
<p>the fifteenth session of the Working Group, which was an internal meeting at which 
</p>
<p>members had reviewed the Working Group&#8217;s methods of work, prepared its upcoming 
</p>
<p>session, communications and country visits and held meetings with various stakeholders 
</p>
<p>and OHCHR units. The Working Group had agreed that it was important to identify its role 
</p>
<p>in relation to the International Decade for People of African Descent and to communicate 
</p>
<p>with the High Commissioner to seek clarity on the issue, including its participation in the 
</p>
<p>Forum for People of African Descent. It had also decided to undertake follow-up visits five 
</p>
<p>years after its previous visit to a country. It further decided to undertake a thematic study on 
</p>
<p>racial stereotyping. Finally it decided to explore ways to increase collaboration with the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.   
</p>
<p>9. The Chair-Rapporteur briefed participants on the country visits of the Working 
</p>
<p>Group to the Netherlands (26 June&#8211;4 July 2014) and Sweden (1&#8211;5 December 2014). At the 
</p>
<p>end of the visits, the Working Group had released press statements, which were available 
</p>
<p>on the OHCHR website.1 The Chair thanked the Governments of the Netherlands and 
</p>
<p>Sweden for their invitation and assistance before, during and after the visits. The Chair also 
</p>
<p>thanked the representatives of NGOs and the people of African descent with whom the 
</p>
<p>Working Group had met during the visits and informed participants that reports of the 
</p>
<p>missions would be submitted to the Human Rights Council at its thirtieth session and made 
</p>
<p>publicly available on the website. 
</p>
<p>10. Ms. Shepherd informed participants that, on behalf of the Working Group, she had 
</p>
<p>presented two reports to the Human Rights Council during its twenty-seventh session: the 
</p>
<p>report on the country visit to Brazil from 4 to 14 December 2013, and the report on the 
</p>
<p>fourteenth session of the Working Group. She mentioned that the report on the fourteenth 
</p>
<p>session of the Working Group had generated much discussion in relation to access to justice 
</p>
<p>for people of African descent. At the invitation of the President of the General Assembly, 
</p>
<p>Ms. Shepherd had delivered the keynote address on the occasion of the commemoration of 
</p>
<p>the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination at the United Nations in 
</p>
<p>New York on 20 March 2015. The theme for the commemorative event was &#8220;Learning 
</p>
<p>from historical tragedies to combat racial discrimination today&#8221;. On the International Day 
</p>
<p>of Remembrance of the Victims of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade on 25 March 
</p>
<p>2015, Ms. Shepherd had participated in the unveiling of the memorial entitled the &#8220;Ark of 
</p>
<p>Return&#8221; at the United Nations in New York. 
</p>
<p>11. The Chair had participated in the sixth session of the Ad Hoc Committee of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council on the Elaboration of Complementary Standards to the International 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 See www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14840&amp;LangID=E and 
</p>

<p>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination on 8 October 2014. 
</p>
<p>In addition to those activities Ms. Fanon Mend&#232;s-France and Ms. Shepherd had participated 
</p>
<p>in the official launch of the International Decade for People of African Descent (2015&#8211;
</p>
<p>2024) at the General Assembly on 10 December 2014.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Summary of deliberations 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Thematic analysis: development and people of African descent 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Working Group devoted its sixteenth session to the third pillar of the theme of 
</p>
<p>the International Decade for People of African Descent, development.  
</p>
<p>13.  Lawrence Juma, Professor and Deputy Dean, Faculty of Law, Rhodes University, 
</p>
<p>South Africa, delivered the keynote presentation on the topic &#8220;Right to development and 
</p>
<p>people of African descent: prospects and challenges&#8221;. He began by stating that the 
</p>
<p>International Decade for People of African Descent presented an opportunity to take stock 
</p>
<p>of efforts that had been made up till then in the uplifting of the conditions of people of 
</p>
<p>African descent and to make recommendations for the future. Mr. Juma delved into the 
</p>
<p>nature of the right to development, asserting that the contentious nature of that right, owing 
</p>
<p>to unresolved implementation challenges, should not obscure the overall benefits of it. Mr. 
</p>
<p>Juma then outlined what development and the right to development should mean for people 
</p>
<p>of African descent, drawing on experiences from Africa, the Americas and Europe. He 
</p>
<p>proposed that the implementation of the right to development and a rights-based approach 
</p>
<p>might provide some avenue for redressing the development needs of marginalized 
</p>
<p>communities. He concluded by identifying areas that would maximize the benefits of a 
</p>
<p>rights-based approach to development, such as increasing participation, normative 
</p>
<p>interventions, the use of special measures and international collaboration. 
</p>
<p>14. An interactive discussion followed the presentation in which members of the 
</p>
<p>Working Group and participants in the session engaged with Mr. Juma, who responded to 
</p>
<p>questions and comments by further expanding on issues such as the justiciability of the 
</p>
<p>right to development, providing further avenues for participatory processes in realizing the 
</p>
<p>right to development and awareness-raising. The Permanent Representative of Brazil 
</p>
<p>thanked the Working Group and the keynote speaker for the presentation, and stated that 
</p>
<p>genuine equality in development was fundamental for the eradication of racism. She added 
</p>
<p>that the International Decade for People of African Descent provided an important 
</p>
<p>opportunity to raise more awareness of the rights of people of African descent.  
</p>
<p>15.  The first panel discussion of the session centred on the legal framework, the right to 
</p>
<p>development and people of African descent. Shyami Puvimanasinghe, Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Officer, Right to Development Section of OHCHR, presented a historical overview of the 
</p>
<p>concept of the right to development and the international legal framework with a focus on 
</p>
<p>the Declaration on the Right to Development. She also presented the new development 
</p>
<p>paradigm based on the sustainable development agenda and its goals, the climate summit 
</p>
<p>and development, and financing for development. She emphasized the need for 
</p>
<p>international solidarity to realize the right to development for all people.  
</p>
<p>16.  Ms. Fanon Mend&#232;s-France made a presentation, entitled &#8220;Law and development&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>Drawing from examples from around the world, she described the challenges in the 
</p>
<p>realization of the right to development by people of African descent, including the denial of 
</p>
<p>the right to human dignity. Despite the developments observed in standard-setting 
</p>
<p>throughout the past decades, people of African descent continued to be discriminated 
</p>
<p>against, inter alia, in various social sectors and in the criminal justice sector. Development </p>


<p>must be applied to uplift millions of African descendants and Africans, who had been 
</p>
<p>perceived only through the devaluing prism of race and racial discrimination.  
</p>
<p>17.  Patrice Tacita, a lawyer and poet belonging to the group Liyannaj Kont Pwofitasyon 
</p>
<p>from Guadeloupe, lectured on &#8220;History, justice and development: the Kalinas&#8217;s land case&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>He provided an overview of the case, which entailed the appropriation of land in Daubin, in 
</p>
<p>the municipality of Sainte-Rose in Guadeloupe, by descendants of slave owners. Mr. Tacita 
</p>
<p>informed the session that the Kalina people, who were people of African descent, had been 
</p>
<p>dispossessed of their ancestral lands during the enslavement and since that time had been 
</p>
<p>unable to reclaim their land owing to lack of recognition of the Kalina people as a distinct 
</p>
<p>group of African descent with their own culture and tradition, as well as to discrimination 
</p>
<p>in the administration of justice. He suggested that a legal approach to addressing the land 
</p>
<p>issue in Guadeloupe was the way to restore what had been destroyed by enslavement 
</p>
<p>followed by colonialism. He expressed hope that the Working Group would consider the 
</p>
<p>case of the Kalina people in their struggle for the return of their dispossessed land.  
</p>
<p>18.  The Director of the Regional Centre for Latin America and the Caribbean of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Rebeca Arias, made a statement on 
</p>
<p>video on &#8220;The state of development of people of African descent in Latin America and the 
</p>
<p>Caribbean region&#8221;. She stated that people of African descent in the region reflected a higher 
</p>
<p>incidence of poverty, unemployment, low levels of schooling and worse health and housing 
</p>
<p>problems along with the racial discrimination and lack of representation and participation 
</p>
<p>faced by people of African descent. UNDP focused on prioritizing efforts to eliminate 
</p>
<p>poverty and overcome inequality and exclusion in the region. The lack of participation of 
</p>
<p>women of African descent in decision-making positions was a key challenge in addressing 
</p>
<p>inequality in the region. Ms. Arias recommended promoting affirmative action policies and 
</p>
<p>international cooperation as important ways to promote and protect the rights of people of 
</p>
<p>African descent in the region.  
</p>
<p>19.  During the interactive discussion a number of participants asked the panellists 
</p>
<p>questions relating to the implementation of the right to development and sought more 
</p>
<p>information on the Kalina people from Mr. Tacita.  
</p>
<p>20.  The second panel discussion focused on the specific needs and experiences of 
</p>
<p>people of African descent in the areas of education, housing, health and employment. Mr. 
</p>
<p>Balcerzak, member of the Working Group, presented the topic, &#8220;Towards more effective 
</p>
<p>implementation of economic, social and cultural rights of people of African descent: 
</p>
<p>challenges and perspectives&#8221;. He laid emphasis on the areas of education, employment, 
</p>
<p>health and housing in the programme of activities of the International Decade for People of 
</p>
<p>African Descent and suggested the inclusion of cultural rights as part and parcel of a human 
</p>
<p>rights approach to development. He also emphasized fostering recognition of human rights 
</p>
<p>among societies through education. There was an important need for more engagement with 
</p>
<p>the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Mr. Balcerzak highlighted the 
</p>
<p>importance of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights, which introduced the individual complaint mechanism in relation to the 
</p>
<p>rights enshrined in the Covenant. He expressed hope that in the framework of the Decade 
</p>
<p>the Working Group would have an opportunity to encourage regional organizations to take 
</p>
<p>more interest in the economic and social rights of people of African descent. 
</p>
<p>21. Rebekah Thomas of the World Health Organization delivered a statement on the 
</p>
<p>topic, &#8220;Ethnicity and health: Afro-descendant population in the region of the Americas&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>Ms. Thomas pointed out that communicable diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, sexually 
</p>
<p>transmitted infections or tuberculosis, continued to be an important cause of morbidity and 
</p>
<p>mortality among people of African descent in the Americas, chronic degenerative diseases, 
</p>
<p>such as cardiovascular disease and cancers, were on the rise &#8212; together with urban health 
</p>
<p>problems (external causes such as violence, suicides and accidents; alcoholism and drug </p>


<p>dependency; pollution, deterioration and destruction of the environment). Women of 
</p>
<p>African descent found that their situation had worsened because of discrimination and that 
</p>
<p>they suffered by virtue of their ethnicity. Ms. Thomas further highlighted ongoing strategies 
</p>
<p>aimed at reducing health inequities, including through targeted work at the inter-agency and 
</p>
<p>country level, by focusing on tuberculosis, other communicable diseases and mental health, 
</p>
<p>as well as on various awareness-raising activities.  
</p>
<p>22. Lisa Wong of the International Labour Organization (ILO) presented a paper on the 
</p>
<p>topic &#8220;People of African descent and the labour market: limited progress&#8221;. She stated that 
</p>
<p>the elimination of discrimination in employment occupation and the promotion of equality 
</p>
<p>of opportunities had been at the core of the work of ILO. However, discrimination based on 
</p>
<p>race continued to affect millions of workers worldwide. She pointed out the multiple forms 
</p>
<p>of discrimination faced by women of African descent, such as the combined effects of the 
</p>
<p>economic crisis, renewed debates about multiculturalism in society, plus the resurgence of 
</p>
<p>intolerance and xenophobic sentiment in many parts of the world. Wage discrimination and 
</p>
<p>racial stereotypes in workplaces, limited access to formal education and vocational training 
</p>
<p>were mentioned as some of the major challenges Enactment and enforcement of legislation 
</p>
<p>prohibiting and preventing discrimination at work, promotion of equal opportunities at 
</p>
<p>work, education, training and awareness, were some of the important means of tackling the 
</p>
<p>challenge, in which ILO was actively engaged. She also provided a number of examples 
</p>
<p>from various countries in that regard.  
</p>
<p>23. Mr. Gumedze, member of the Working Group, delivered a presentation on the topic 
</p>
<p>&#8220;The effects of racial discrimination on development in Africa&#8221;. Mr. Gumedze asserted that 
</p>
<p>racial discrimination negated development and impeded the enjoyment of the right to 
</p>
<p>development in Africa. He stated that the legacy of apartheid in South Africa, racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination in Madagascar and Tunisia, the genocide in Rwanda as a result of 
</p>
<p>discrimination on grounds of ethnicity, modern slavery in Mauritania and the Sudan and the 
</p>
<p>prevalence of discrimination against people with albinism in Africa provided several 
</p>
<p>indicative examples of racial discrimination in Africa. He recommended that the Working 
</p>
<p>Group focus on those issues, which adversely affected the development of the continent. 
</p>
<p>24. During the interactive debate following the panel discussion, a number of 
</p>
<p>participants commented and asked the panellists questions on the respective presentations. 
</p>
<p>Ms. Fanon Mend&#232;s-France asked the presenters about the barriers to quality education. 
</p>
<p>Ms. Shepherd commented that it was essential that development should not only be looked 
</p>
<p>at from an economic perspective, its linkages to culture were equally important. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Guzmedze commented on the importance of cultural education, while Mr. Sunga 
</p>
<p>requested further information on culturally appropriate health services. In response, 
</p>
<p>Mr. Balcerzak pointed out that it was essential to look into education systems that promoted 
</p>
<p>scholarships and included issues relating to the history and culture of people of African 
</p>
<p>descent, as ways to address barriers to education. Ms. Thomas responded that the 
</p>
<p>participation of people of African descent and the principle of accessible, affordable and 
</p>
<p>acceptable health services were important elements in ensuring culturally appropriate health 
</p>
<p>services. The representative of Uruguay requested further information on the impact of 
</p>
<p>quotas, to which Ms. Wong responded that there was very little information available on 
</p>
<p>the evaluation of the impact of the different quotas that had been put in place at the national 
</p>
<p>level. 
</p>
<p>25. The third panel of the session focused on the International Decade for People of 
</p>
<p>African Descent. The Chair of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Elaboration of 
</p>
<p>Complementary Standards and Ambassador of South Africa, Abdul Samad Minty, 
</p>
<p>delivered his statement. He stated that most people of African descent continued to live in 
</p>
<p>conditions of extreme poverty exacerbated by the current economic and financial crises, 
</p>
<p>which were cascading effects of the slave trade, the transatlantic slave trade, enslavement </p>


<p>and colonialism. He said that, despite all existing mechanisms, racism continued to rise; 
</p>
<p>more aggressive manifestations of racism currently needed stronger measures and, in that 
</p>
<p>connection, he gave a few examples of the prevalence of racism in sports, in the statements 
</p>
<p>of politicians, in the treatment of migrants and in the media, among other areas. The 
</p>
<p>Decade provided an important opportunity to focus genuinely on the plight of victims and 
</p>
<p>on unconditional respect for human dignity. The Ad Hoc Committee would appreciate 
</p>
<p>receiving meaningful contributions on those issues from the Working Group.  
</p>
<p>26. Jacques Martial, actor and president of the &#201;tablissement public du parc et de la 
</p>
<p>grande halle de la Villette in Paris, delivered his presentation on &#8220;The <i>dialogue de 
</i></p>
<p><i>citadelles</i> project, culture and its linkages to the International Decade&#8221;. He said that the 
</p>
<p>International Decade for People of African Descent provided an important framework for 
</p>
<p>stressing the historical, geographical and multicultural aspects of people of African descent 
</p>
<p>as exemplified by the <i>dialogue de citadelles</i> project. The project was aimed at highlighting 
</p>
<p>the shared history of slavery and colonialism of the Caribbean as well as the contribution of 
</p>
<p>people of African descent in the Caribbean to world culture. In particular, the project 
</p>
<p>disseminated art and creation of the Caribbean through exhibitions, cultural events, 
</p>
<p>performance arts and intercultural dialogue, with a view not only to raise awareness about 
</p>
<p>the richness of the culture and history of the region, but also to allow different countries in 
</p>
<p>the region to share their experiences among themselves.  
</p>
<p>27. Ms. Shepherd delivered a presentation on &#8220;Reparation and the right to 
</p>
<p>development&#8221;. She established the linkages between justice and development by drawing 
</p>
<p>upon the salient observations and recommendations of the Durban Declaration and 
</p>
<p>Programme of Action and the programme of activities of the International Decade for 
</p>
<p>People of African Descent. She referred to the need for States to repair the damage done by 
</p>
<p>the transatlantic trade in captured Africans, enslavement and colonialism. She also referred 
</p>
<p>to the destruction of African communities, the capture and forced relocation of Africans to 
</p>
<p>the Americas, the African Maafa, inhumane treatment during enslavement, post-slavery 
</p>
<p>racial apartheid and suppression of anti-colonial struggles, as violations committed against 
</p>
<p>people of African descent. She further emphasized the fact that poverty was a consequence 
</p>
<p>of colonialism and had always been tied to its discriminatory practices and legacies. Ms. 
</p>
<p>Shepherd introduced the Caribbean Community&#8217;s Ten Point Action Plan for reparatory 
</p>
<p>justice and elaborated in particular on the relevance of technology transfer which would 
</p>
<p>serve to address historical tragedies and development. She pointed out that it was important 
</p>
<p>to engage in psychological rehabilitation and reclaim dignity and pride through &#8220;concerted 
</p>
<p>efforts of racial affirmation&#8221;, as espoused by the poet Aim&#233; C&#233;saire.  
</p>
<p>28. Following the presentations, representatives of Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Tunisia 
</p>
<p>and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and several NGO representatives spoke about 
</p>
<p>their respective plans and programmes in implementing the International Decade for People 
</p>
<p>of African Descent at the national level and at the local level, respectively.  
</p>
<p>29. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights delivered his statement 
</p>
<p>to the session on 1 April 2015. He said that he was honoured that the General Assembly 
</p>
<p>had appointed him as Coordinator of the International Decade for People of African 
</p>
<p>Descent. In that context, he underlined that the conclusions and recommendations resulting 
</p>
<p>from the session on the theme of &#8220;Development and people of African descent&#8221; would be 
</p>
<p>valuable inputs for the implementation of the programme of activities for the Decade.  
</p>
<p>30. The High Commissioner pointed out that, despite economic growth, an intolerable 
</p>
<p>number of people of African descent continued to be burdened by underdevelopment. 
</p>
<p>People of African descent faced discrimination in their access to fundamental services, 
</p>
<p>including education, health care and basic resources. Even systems for law enforcement and 
</p>
<p>justice &#8212; the very systems that should ensure fairness and protect all individuals &#8212; were 
</p>
<p>often skewed against people of African descent, who were massively and unfairly </p>


<p>overrepresented in prisons around the globe. More recently, there had been growing and 
</p>
<p>vicious manifestations of racism, Afrophobia and xenophobia in many countries. 
</p>
<p>31. The High Commissioner also noted the importance of recommendations emanating 
</p>
<p>from the Working Group, which had frequently highlighted many severe developmental 
</p>
<p>challenges faced by people of African descent, including the prevalence of multiple, 
</p>
<p>aggravated or intersecting forms of discrimination, adding to the burden of racial prejudice 
</p>
<p>discrimination on other grounds, such as sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, 
</p>
<p>social origin, property, birth, disability or other status. He noted with appreciation the 
</p>
<p>Working Group&#8217;s joining hands with the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination to discuss the fight against racial discrimination faced by people of African 
</p>
<p>descent on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the International 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner expressed the deep commitment of his Office in supporting efforts that 
</p>
<p>helped to end racial discrimination against people of African descent and in realizing the 
</p>
<p>rights of people of African descent. 
</p>
<p>32. Following the statement of the High Commissioner, the fourth panel of the session 
</p>
<p>was held to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the International 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The first speaker on 
</p>
<p>the panel, Pastor Murillo Mart&#237;nez, member of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination and focal point on people of African descent, discussed the prevalence of a 
</p>
<p>number of myths about cultural freedom and development. Those myths had been used to 
</p>
<p>justify the false dichotomy of development or diversity, which had allowed the construction 
</p>
<p>of an economic enterprise the size of the transatlantic slave trade and slavery in the 
</p>
<p>Americas, which he claimed was still alive in many societies and had tangible 
</p>
<p>consequences with regard to racism and racial discrimination, and limited development 
</p>
<p>opportunities for social groups such as those of African descent. The Committee had 
</p>
<p>exerted itself as a catalyst for preventing current and potential tensions, by periodically 
</p>
<p>enabling a kind of intercultural dialogue within countries through its examination of 
</p>
<p>Member States and their adherence to the Convention. He also delved into the application 
</p>
<p>of general recommendation No. 34 (2011) on racial discrimination against people of 
</p>
<p>African descent and the multifarious development challenges faced by people of African 
</p>
<p>descent globally, which required global solutions. 
</p>
<p>33. Glenn Payot from Minority Rights Group International presented the work of the 
</p>
<p>Group, an international NGO working to secure the rights of ethnic, religious and linguistic 
</p>
<p>minorities and indigenous peoples in different parts of the world. He gave examples of its 
</p>
<p>work in relation to Dominicans of Haitian descent in the Dominican Republic, who faced 
</p>
<p>risks of statelessness; issues of violence and discrimination against black communities in 
</p>
<p>Eastern Europe and people of African descent in India; awareness-raising programmes 
</p>
<p>undertaken by Nubian groups in Egypt; and efforts to document the situation of black 
</p>
<p>communities in Iraq and Yemen. He highlighted the importance of the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of Racial Discrimination in the Group&#8217;s work in the above-mentioned 
</p>
<p>countries, and added that the Committee offered unique opportunities to address specific 
</p>
<p>issues in great detail with relevant recommendations and to engage in discussions with a 
</p>
<p>State on the details of its legislation, its policies and practices. The mandate of the 
</p>
<p>Committee allowed it to focus on the most vulnerable segments of society, even when they 
</p>
<p>were small in number. In the context of development and people of African descent, key 
</p>
<p>challenges that remained were the lack of recognition, including the lack of data and 
</p>
<p>statistics, the systemic and structural nature of underdevelopment and the need for 
</p>
<p>collective action by rights holders to claim their rights. 
</p>
<p>34. Mr. Sunga, member of the Working Group, delivered a presentation on &#8220;Reflections 
</p>
<p>on the African diaspora in Asia&#8221;. He provided an overview of the range of obstacles to </p>


<p>development faced by African asylum seekers in Australia, Indonesia and Malaysia, and 
</p>
<p>people of African descent in Japan. Mr. Sunga gave a number of examples as to how the 
</p>
<p>rights to health, education, housing and employment in the above-mentioned countries were 
</p>
<p>being compromised, or were at risk of being violated. Given the diversity of the continent 
</p>
<p>of Asia, Mr. Sunga said that States in Asia, in spite of their own struggles with a colonial 
</p>
<p>past and the experiences of their own nationals as asylum seekers and migrants, had shown 
</p>
<p>different levels of limited understanding of the African diaspora in Asia. He emphasized the 
</p>
<p>need to surface the truth about racism in that region, and recommended positive measures 
</p>
<p>and awareness-raising in the different sectors to remove obstacles to the development of 
</p>
<p>people of African descent, including appropriate steps to remedy violations of their rights.  
</p>
<p>35. During the interactive session, a number of representatives of Member States and 
</p>
<p>NGOs participated in the discussion. In particular, Ms. Fanon Mend&#232;s-France raised the 
</p>
<p>issue of increasing further collaboration with the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination. She also spoke of the situation of the Jarawa people in India, while 
</p>
<p>Ms. Shepherd mentioned the situation of people of African descent in the Philippines, about 
</p>
<p>which Mr. Sunga provided additional information. The respective presenters responded 
</p>
<p>with further information on the issues raised.  
</p>
<p>36. The fifth and final panel discussion of the session focused on gender, African 
</p>
<p>descent and development. The first speaker was Biancamaria Pomeranzi, member of the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and focal point on 
</p>
<p>development, who presented the topic of &#8220;Twenty years after Beijing: the role of the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in assessing the impact of 
</p>
<p>the Beijing Platform for Action on women of African descent&#8221;. Ms. Pomeranzi said that the 
</p>
<p>Beijing Platform acknowledged that gender subordination might be informed and 
</p>
<p>heightened by race discrimination, xenophobia and other experiences and, because racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination might exist or had intensified owing to its intersection with gender, attempts 
</p>
<p>to address the persistence of racism required incorporating a gender analysis on the concept 
</p>
<p>of interdependence especially within the context of anti-discrimination law, treaties and 
</p>
<p>treaty bodies. She explained how general recommendations of the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women sought to call upon State parties to report on discrimination 
</p>
<p>at the intersection of race and gender, offering a guide to constructive dialogue with State 
</p>
<p>parties in order to eliminate specific forms of violence and discrimination faced by women 
</p>
<p>of African descent, and to concretize the interdependence and intersectionality of human 
</p>
<p>rights of women of African descendent.  
</p>
<p>37. The Secretary General of the Young Women&#8217;s Christian Association, Nyaradzayi 
</p>
<p>Gumbonzvanda, shared her personal reflections on developments since the Beijing Platform 
</p>
<p>for Action. She spoke in particular about the need to carry out collective efforts in a number 
</p>
<p>of different areas, such as gender equality and access to education and health services for 
</p>
<p>girls and women of African descent. She emphasized the importance of strengthening 
</p>
<p>linkages between Africa and the diaspora. Ms. Gumbonzvanda recommended that the 
</p>
<p>Working Group further discuss issues of the rights of women of African descent, focusing 
</p>
<p>on specific areas such as child marriage, among others.  
</p>
<p>38. Suzanne Charles-Watson, from the Institute for Gender and Development Studies at 
</p>
<p>the University of the West Indies, delivered a video statement on the topic of &#8220;Men, 
</p>
<p>masculinities and the project of development&#8221;. She provided a Caribbean perspective on 
</p>
<p>how issues of gender and understanding masculinities influence Caribbean development 
</p>
<p>paradigms. Ms. Charles-Watson stated that, with high unemployment rates, susceptibility to 
</p>
<p>the impact of climate change and migration, as well as inadequate and overburdened social 
</p>
<p>protection systems, the region was currently confronted with the need to develop new 
</p>
<p>paradigms of development. In that regard, she pointed out that the study of the impact of </p>


<p>gender systems on Caribbean societal structures was still comparatively new. She added 
</p>
<p>that a study of masculinity revealed systems of gender privileging, relegation of women and 
</p>
<p>girls to the private space and thus underrepresentation in the public sphere, and gender-
</p>
<p>based violence and violence against women and children. She concluded that Caribbean 
</p>
<p>development paradigms must focus on equity and equality where issues of gender, 
</p>
<p>masculinity and femininity ultimately became issues of human rights and human dignity. 
</p>
<p>39. The Chief of the OHCHR Women&#8217;s Rights and Gender Section, Veronica Birga, 
</p>
<p>presented a paper on the achievements in realizing the rights of women of African descent 
</p>
<p>since the adoption of the Beijing Platform for Action 20 years previously. Ms. Birga 
</p>
<p>established linkages between the emphasis placed by the Beijing Platform for Action and 
</p>
<p>the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. Both highlighted the detrimental impact 
</p>
<p>of intersecting forms of discrimination on the enjoyment of human rights, particularly on 
</p>
<p>women from ethnic minorities, including women of African descent. She also alluded to the 
</p>
<p>wide variety of challenges faced by women of African descent in different parts of the 
</p>
<p>world as identified by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 
</p>
<p>and a number of special procedures mandate holders, such as lack of access to social 
</p>
<p>services, high rates of maternal mortality, unequal access to education, violence targeting 
</p>
<p>women of African descent, especially their vulnerability to being trafficked, unequal 
</p>
<p>opportunities for participating in decision-making and public life, occupational segregation 
</p>
<p>and disproportionate incarceration rates of Afro-descendant women. Ms. Birga further 
</p>
<p>presented a short video focusing on the work of a doctor in the United States of America 
</p>
<p>who was defending the health rights of African-American women. She suggested that 
</p>
<p>disaggregated data, temporary special measures and access to justice were measures to 
</p>
<p>address the violations of the rights of women of African descent. Representatives of Brazil, 
</p>
<p>Panama and South Africa expressed their appreciation of the different presentations made 
</p>
<p>by the panellists and a number of NGOs requested follow-up information from the 
</p>
<p>presenters.  
</p>
<p>40. On 30 March 2015, to celebrate the launch of the International Decade for People of 
</p>
<p>African Descent, the Working Group had organized a special cultural event, along with an 
</p>
<p>exhibition, entitled &#8220;People of African descent: recognition, justice and development&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>displaying the work of the Brazilian artist, In&#234;z Olud&#233;. The event was attended by 
</p>
<p>representatives of a number of permanent missions to the United Nations in Geneva, staff 
</p>
<p>members of the United Nations and civil society.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>41. <b>The Working Group concluded its sixteenth session on the theme of 
</b></p>
<p>&#8220;Development<b> and people of African descent</b>&#8221;<b> and made the following conclusions and 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations.  
</b></p>
<p>42. <b>The Working Group recorded its appreciation to the High Commissioner for 
</b></p>
<p><b>his intervention at the sixteenth session. It also thanked Member States and civil 
</b></p>
<p><b>society for their active participation.  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>43. <b>The Working Group concludes that poverty is both a cause and a consequence 
</b></p>
<p><b>of discrimination. Development should not be narrowly defined as economic 
</b></p>
<p><b>development only, but must also include political, economic, social, cultural and 
</b></p>
<p><b>environmental aspects, consistent with the Declaration on the Right to Development. 
</b></p>
<p><b>T</b>he Working Group &#8220;recognizes that &#8230; historical injustices have undeniably </p>


<p><b>contributed to the poverty, underdevelopment,</b> <b>marginalization, social exclusion, 
</b></p>
<p><b>economic disparities, instability and insecurity that affect many people in different 
</b></p>
<p>parts of the world, in particular in developing countries&#8221; and &#8220;<b>recognizes the need to 
</b></p>
<p><b>develop programmes for the social and economic development of these societies and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Diaspora, within the framework of a new partnership based on the spirit of 
</b></p>
<p>solidarity and mutual respect&#8221;<b> (Durban Programme of Action, para. 158), in areas 
</b></p>
<p><b>such as debt relief, poverty eradication, market access and the promotion of foreign 
</b></p>
<p><b>direct investment. 
</b></p>
<p>44. <b>The Working Group points out that, despite the publication of evidence, there 
</b></p>
<p><b>is still insufficient attention paid to the proven contributions of people of African 
</b></p>
<p><b>descent to world development. It concludes that the role that people of African descent 
</b></p>
<p><b>have played in global development must be recognized both in terms of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>contribution that the African continent has historically made to worldwide 
</b></p>
<p><b>development, including during the transatlantic slave trade, and the contributions 
</b></p>
<p><b>that Africans and the African diaspora have made and continue to make to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>contemporary world.  
</b></p>
<p>45. <b>In a period of economic and financial crisis, principles of participation, equality 
</b></p>
<p><b>and non-discrimination should be integrated into all development activities where the 
</b></p>
<p><b>realization of rights, including with respect to the fight against poverty and access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>education, health, employment and political participation, are the goals of 
</b></p>
<p><b>development. The Working Group also stresses that repairing the catastrophic 
</b></p>
<p><b>damage done by enslavement and the slave trade would contribute to development. 
</b></p>
<p>46. <b>The International Decade for People of African Descent is an important 
</b></p>
<p><b>milestone in the struggle for the protection and promotion of the rights of people of 
</b></p>
<p><b>African descent and their political, economic social and cultural development. On the 
</b></p>
<p><b>occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the International Convention on the Elimination 
</b></p>
<p><b>of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Working Group recognizes the important 
</b></p>
<p><b>role that the Convention and the Committee have played in protecting the rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>people of African descent. 
</b></p>
<p>47. <b>People of African descent remain invisible within societies in some States, 
</b></p>
<p><b>owing to, inter alia, the lack of statistical data, including data disaggregated along 
</b></p>
<p><b>ethnic lines. This poses an obstacle to assessing the progress made, as well as 
</b></p>
<p><b>challenges faced by people of African descent in attaining overall development.  
</b></p>
<p>48. <b>Considering the conditions of extreme poverty in which the majority of people 
</b></p>
<p><b>of African descent live in both developing and developed countries, development 
</b></p>
<p><b>activities and programmes must address all people of African descent, regardless of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the country in which they live. Racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
</b></p>
<p><b>intolerance pose major obstacles for people of African descent in the eradication of 
</b></p>
<p><b>poverty.  
</b></p>
<p>49. <b>The Working Group is concerned by the pervasive and distinct form of racism 
</b></p>
<p><b>faced by people of African descent in employment and the labour market. Most 
</b></p>
<p><b>statistical data from different parts of the world point to people of African descent 
</b></p>
<p><b>and Africans as being among the most unemployed, and often subjected to racial 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination while seeking employment. Similarly, people of African descent often 
</b></p>
<p><b>lack access to quality health services and face disparities in health status as a result of 
</b></p>
<p><b>racial discrimination.  
</b></p>
<p>50. <b>The right to education is not enjoyed equally by all; millions of girls, boys, 
</b></p>
<p><b>women and men of African descent suffer disproportionately from unequal access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>quality education. Failure to ensure equal access to education robs people of their </b></p>


<p><b>opportunity to reach their full human potential and to contribute to the development 
</b></p>
<p><b>of their own communities and society at large. 
</b></p>
<p>51. <b>The segregation or ghettoization of people of African descent into low 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards of housing and the lack of measures to support the development and 
</b></p>
<p><b>improvement of poor housing conditions faced by people of African descent is a 
</b></p>
<p><b>matter of grave concern to the Working Group. 
</b></p>
<p>52. <b>The Working Group recognizes that women and girls of African descent face 
</b></p>
<p><b>multiple, aggravated or intersecting forms of discrimination based on sex, language, 
</b></p>
<p><b>religion, political or other opinion, social origin, property, birth, disability or other 
</b></p>
<p><b>status. Such discrimination manifests itself in high rates of illiteracy, unemployment, 
</b></p>
<p><b>lack of access to health services, quality education, landownership, drinking water and 
</b></p>
<p><b>sanitation, and gender-based violence. 
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>Judicial and administrative enforcement of human rights and the justiciability 
</b></p>
<p><b>of economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to development, is crucial 
</b></p>
<p><b>in ensuring that the rights to health, housing, employment, education, participation in 
</b></p>
<p><b>development and all other rights are enjoyed by people of African descent. 
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>The Working Group recognizes the good practices in some States, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>initiatives aimed at guaranteeing participation of people of African descent in 
</b></p>
<p><b>decision-making, data collection and development policies addressing concerns of 
</b></p>
<p><b>people of African descent.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>The Working Group urges States to adopt measures, consistent with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Declaration on the Right to Development, aimed at guaranteeing active, free and 
</b></p>
<p><b>meaningful participation of people of African descent in all political, economic, social 
</b></p>
<p><b>and cultural aspects of society and in the advancement and economic development of 
</b></p>
<p><b>their countries. States should promote a greater knowledge of and respect for their 
</b></p>
<p><b>heritage and culture and ensure participation in development and decision-making, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and in the fair distribution of benefits resulting therefrom. States should take 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures to realize the right to development taking into account the need to redress 
</b></p>
<p><b>historical injustices through development programmes. 
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>The Working Group recommends that States take into account the linkages 
</b></p>
<p><b>between enslavement and colonialism that leads to underdevelopment, and take the 
</b></p>
<p><b>impact of this intersectionality into account in development policies. 
</b></p>
<p>57.<b> The Working Group suggests that all agencies of the United Nations system, as 
</b></p>
<p><b>well as other international development and financial institutions, monitor the 
</b></p>
<p><b>situation of people of African descent and report on their status and implement the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Guidance note of the Secretary-General on Racial Discrimination and Protection of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Minorities. 
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>The Working Group encourages all human rights mechanisms of the United 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nations, regional human rights bodies, national human rights institutions and civil 
</b></p>
<p><b>society organizations to devote more attention to people of African descent in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of their respective mandates.</b>  
</p>
<p>59. <b>The Working Group encourages Governments and international development 
</b></p>
<p><b>and financial institutions to establish programmes, based on the participation of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities concerned, aimed at improving the economic and social conditions of 
</b></p>
<p><b>people of African descent. It also encourages Governments in the affected regions to 
</b></p>
<p><b>use regional arrangements and organizations to address the effects of </b></p>


<p><b>underdevelopment, which tend to have a disproportionate impact on people of African 
</b></p>
<p><b>descent.</b> 
</p>
<p>60. <b>Civil society should be encouraged to form national, regional and international 
</b></p>
<p><b>networks to share learning, experiences and good practices, raise awareness of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>situation of people of African descent and carry out joint advocacy and development 
</b></p>
<p><b>initiatives, and develop capacity-building programmes intended for people of African 
</b></p>
<p><b>descent with a particular focus on developing leadership skills. Civil society is also 
</b></p>
<p><b>encouraged to increase its cooperation with the Working Group.</b> 
</p>
<p>61. <b>In the context of the International Decade for People of African Descent, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Working Group urges Governments, financial and development institutions and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>funds and programmes and specialized agencies of the United Nations, in accordance 
</b></p>
<p><b>with their regular budgets and the procedures of their governing bodies, to assign 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular priority, and allocate sufficient funding, within their areas of competence 
</b></p>
<p><b>and budgets, to improving the situation of Africans and people of African descent, 
</b></p>
<p><b>while devoting special attention to the needs of these populations in developing 
</b></p>
<p><b>countries, inter alia through the preparation of specific programmes of action for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of the programme of activities of the Decade.</b> 
</p>
<p>62. <b>The Working Group encourages Governments, with the assistance of 
</b></p>
<p><b>specialized agencies and international development and financial institutions as 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriate, to collect and compile reliable statistical data on the political, economic 
</b></p>
<p><b>and social conditions of people of African descent and to disseminate such information 
</b></p>
<p><b>widely, not only in order to undertake specific development projects but also to 
</b></p>
<p><b>empower all stakeholders in the fight to improve the situation of these people. 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>Consistent with existing human rights commitments,</b> <b>States should also address 
</b></p>
<p><b>poverty alleviation that eliminates racial discrimination, including through the 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of development initiatives aimed at realizing the rights of people of 
</b></p>
<p><b>African descent, in a manner appropriate to their culture and identity; ensure the full, 
</b></p>
<p><b>active and meaningful participation of people of African descent throughout 
</b></p>
<p><b>development programme cycles; and adopt measures to preserve, protect and restore 
</b></p>
<p><b>the traditional knowledge of people of African descent. 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>States should take concrete measures to eliminate racism, racial discrimination, 
</b></p>
<p><b>xenophobia and related intolerance in the workplace against all workers, in particular 
</b></p>
<p><b>Africans and people of African descent, including migrants and women, and ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>the full equality of all before the law, including labour law. States should ensure that 
</b></p>
<p>workers&#8217; rights of people of African descent<b>, including those relating to fair and equal 
</b></p>
<p><b>wages, are protected, by increasing the effectiveness of legislation that prohibits all 
</b></p>
<p><b>discriminatory practices in employment and the labour market that affect people of 
</b></p>
<p><b>African descent, including through the implementation of special measures to 
</b></p>
<p><b>promote the employment of people of African descent in public administration, as well 
</b></p>
<p><b>as in private companies, including affirmative action policies such as quota systems.</b> 
</p>
<p>65. <b>States should involve people of African descent in designing and implementing 
</b></p>
<p><b>health-based programmes and projects, ensuring that quality health services are 
</b></p>
<p><b>available and accessible without discrimination, particularly in rural and 
</b></p>
<p><b>marginalized areas with large populations of people of African descent, and that 
</b></p>
<p><b>services are provided in a culturally appropriate manner and accessible to people of 
</b></p>
<p><b>African descent, including the most vulnerable.</b> 
</p>
<p>66. <b>States should take all the measures necessary to give effect to the right of people 
</b></p>
<p><b>of African descent, particularly children and young people, to free primary education 
</b></p>
<p><b>and access to all levels and forms of quality public education without discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Measures should be taken to increase the number of teachers of African descent </b></p>


<p><b>working in educational institutions. The Working Group also urges States to take 
</b></p>
<p><b>steps aimed at removing negative stereotypes and imagery in teaching materials, by 
</b></p>
<p><b>promoting more inclusive education systems, and to take measures to reduce the 
</b></p>
<p><b>school dropout rate for children of African descent, with greater support and 
</b></p>
<p><b>attention to families and ensuring that curricula are accessible, culturally relevant, 
</b></p>
<p><b>providing education in their own language and promoting their cultural heritage, 
</b></p>
<p><b>where necessary. States must implement their human rights obligations regarding the 
</b></p>
<p><b>content of education.</b> 
</p>
<p>67. <b>States should implement special measures to ensure people of African descent 
</b></p>
<p><b>have access to necessary housing services, by involving communities of people of 
</b></p>
<p><b>African descent as partners in housing project construction, rehabilitation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>maintenance and taking measures to ensure legal security of tenure, availability of 
</b></p>
<p><b>services, materials, facilities and infrastructure, affordability, habitability, 
</b></p>
<p><b>accessibility, location and cultural adequacy, and prevent the forced eviction of people 
</b></p>
<p><b>of African descent from their homes in both urban and rural contexts. The Working 
</b></p>
<p><b>Group also urges States, in accordance with international human rights standards and 
</b></p>
<p><b>their respective domestic legal frameworks, to resolve problems of ownership of 
</b></p>
<p><b>ancestral lands, inhabited for generations by indigenous people and by people of 
</b></p>
<p><b>African descent and illegally expropriated by colonial rulers.</b> 
</p>
<p>68. <b>The Working Group urges States to incorporate a gender perspective in all 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes of action against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
</b></p>
<p><b>intolerance. States, international organizations, NGOs and the private sector should 
</b></p>
<p><b>consult and involve women of African descent, through a participatory and inclusive 
</b></p>
<p><b>approach, in the processes and decisions relating to the elaboration and 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of programmes and plans aimed at their social development. States 
</b></p>
<p><b>should ensure that development paradigms focus on equity and equality, where issues 
</b></p>
<p><b>of gender, masculinity and femininity ultimately become issues of human rights and 
</b></p>
<p><b>human dignity.</b>  
</p>
<p>69. <b>The Working Group urges States to recognize the unique situation of youth of 
</b></p>
<p><b>African descent and to implement targeted opportunities and specific measures that 
</b></p>
<p><b>promote and advance the development of leadership and active participation in all 
</b></p>
<p><b>sectors of society.</b>  
</p>
<p>70. <b>The Working Group recommends that the sustainable development goals of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>United Nations development agenda beyond 2015 be applied as benchmarks by States 
</b></p>
<p><b>to measure progress regarding the political, economic and social development of 
</b></p>
<p><b>people of African descent. While grants and aid are welcome, the goal should be long-
</b></p>
<p><b>term development, especially in post-colonial societies.</b> 
</p>
<p>71. <b>The Working Group urges States to develop mechanisms of redress for 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations of the right to development, concerning both people of African descent and 
</b></p>
<p><b>of African States. Mechanisms should be available to all, including documented and 
</b></p>
<p><b>undocumented migrant workers and asylum seekers. There should be people of 
</b></p>
<p><b>African descent serving as officials in implementing these mechanisms.</b>  
</p>
<p>72. <b>States should ensure that the development and implementation of positive 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures, aimed at accelerating the achievement of substantive equality and for 
</b></p>
<p><b>securing equal access of Africans and people of African descent to opportunities, 
</b></p>
<p><b>contribute to poverty reduction and lead to the empowerment of communities.</b> 
</p>
<p>73. <b>The Working Group encourages States to share good practices, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>initiatives aimed at guaranteeing participation of people of African descent in 
</b></p>
<p><b>decision-making, data collection and development policies addressing concerns of 
</b></p>
<p><b>people of African descent.</b>  </p>


<p>74. <b>The Working Group urges States to develop public policies that do not keep 
</b></p>
<p><b>people of African descent and African countries in a state of economic dependence but 
</b></p>
<p><b>rather ensure that they benefit from development on an equal footing with the rest of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the population and the developed countries, while at the same time respecting their 
</b></p>
<p><b>sociocultural differences.</b>  
</p>
<p>75. <b>The inclusion of reparations should be in line with the Durban Declaration and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Programme of Action, which recognizes the contribution of historical injustices to 
</b></p>
<p><b>contemporary poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, social exclusion, 
</b></p>
<p><b>economic disparities, instability and insecurity, in particular in developing countries, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the need to develop programmes for the social and economic development of these 
</b></p>
<p><b>societies and the diaspora.</b>  
</p>
<p>76. <b>The Working Group encourages people of African descent and the African 
</b></p>
<p><b>diaspora to pursue domestic redress for racism, racial discrimination, Afrophobia, 
</b></p>
<p><b>xenophobia and related intolerance that impede development.</b> 
</p>
<p>77. <b>At the same time, the Working Group encourages people of African descent to 
</b></p>
<p><b>celebrate the achievements of their ancestors and honour their memory through the 
</b></p>
<p><b>truth and acknowledgement of that history which continue to undermine societies. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Such strategies would represent means of self-awareness and sociocultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>development.</b> 
</p>
<p>78. <b>The International Decade for People of African Descent should be used to build 
</b></p>
<p><b>bridges of understanding and reconnect the diaspora with the continent of Africa in 
</b></p>
<p><b>order to address the feelings of loss, lack of identity and absence of indigenous 
</b></p>
<p><b>knowledge that plague people of African descent in the diaspora.</b>  
</p>
<p>79.<b> The Working Group recommends that during the International Decade for 
</b></p>
<p><b>People of African Descent, the International Forum for People of African Descent 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be the platform for States, civil society and the United Nations to plan concrete 
</b></p>
<p><b>action for the total recognition of the rights of people of African descent. The Working 
</b></p>
<p><b>Group is concerned that the Forum is not a permanent forum. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The Working Group looks forward to contributing to the establishment of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>International Forum for People of African Descent and to the process of developing 
</b></p>
<p><b>and drafting the declaration on people of African descent under the auspices of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>International Decade for People of African Descent, including through its active 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation in the Forum.</b>  </p>
