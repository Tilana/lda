INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b>1. At its sixty-first session, the Commission on Human Rights, in its resolution 2005/38 
entitled &#8216;The right to freedom of opinion and expression&#8217;, appealed to all States to cooperate 
fully with and assist the Special Rapporteur in the performance of his tasks, and to provide him 
with all necessary information requested by him.  The Human Rights Council, in its decision 
1/102, dated 30 June 2006, decided to extend exceptionally for one year, subject to the review to 
be undertaken by the Human Rights Council in conformity with General Assembly resolution 
60/251, the mandates and the mandate holders of all the special procedures of the Commission 
on Human Rights.  The Human Rights Council also requested the special procedures to continue 
with the implementation of their mandates and the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to continue to provide them with the necessary support. 
 
2. In accordance with the above-mentioned provisions, the present report contains, on a 
country-by-country basis, summaries of general and individual allegations, as well as urgent 
appeals transmitted to Governments between 1 January and 31 December 2006, as well as replies 
received during the same period. Observations made by the Special Rapporteur have also been 
included where applicable.  
 
3. During the period under review, the Special Rapporteur transmitted 399 communications 
on behalf of 1227 persons to the Governments of 89 countries: Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, 
Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Bhutan, Brazil, 
Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Chile, the People&#8217;s Republic of 
China, Colombia, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Croatia, Cuba, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, 
Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, 
Georgia, Ghana, Greece, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Islamic Republic of Iran, 
Israel, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Malaysia, Maldives, 
Mauritania, Mexico, Morocco, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Paraguay, 
Peru, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Republic of Serbia, Romania, Russian Federation, Saudi 
Arabia, Serbia and Montenegro&#8224;, Senegal, Singapore, Somalia, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syrian 
Arab Republic, Tajikistan, Thailand, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Tunisia, 
Turkey, Turkmenistan, Uganda, United Arab Emirates, United Republic of Tanzania, United 
States of America, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, Viet Nam and Zimbabwe. 
 
4. Replies to communications received after 31 December 2006 will be included in the next 
communication report of the Special Rapporteur as well as replies not yet translated by 31 
December 2006. 
 
5. Owing to restrictions on the length of documents, the Special Rapporteur has been obliged 
to reduce considerably details of communications sent and received. The full text of all 
                                                 
&#8224;<b> </b>The reply from the Government was sent before 3 June 2006, when the Secretary-General received a letter from 
the President of the Republic of Serbia informing him that the membership of Serbia and Montenegro in the United 
Nations was to be continued by the Republic of Serbia and that the name &#8220;Republic of Serbia&#8221; was henceforth to be 
used instead of the name &#8220;Serbia and Montenegro&#8221;. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1

communications is available within the files of the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights. 
</p><p> 
6. In reporting on the communications the Special Rapporteur has used initials for those 
victims, who, in his opinion, could be in a potentially sensitive situation, in order to respect their 
privacy and to prevent the possibility of further victimization.  With a view to preserving the 
presumption of innocence, the Special Rapporteur omitted to include the names of alleged 
perpetrators, and of other individuals involved in the cases included in this report.  Conversely, 
Governments&#8217; communications may contain names of persons and/or disclose specific situations 
linked to the violation.  
 
7. The Special Rapporteur wishes to reiterate that violations and concerns regarding the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression are, to different extents, a common phenomenon in the 
whole world.  Consequently, the exclusion or the inclusion of a particular country or territory 
should not be interpreted as the indication of any specific choice done by the Special Rapporteur 
regarding the analysis of trends and patterns of the implementation of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression.

8. On 17 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning <b>Omid 
Yakmanish</b>, a cameraman of <i>Tolo TV</i>. <i>Tolo TV</i> was the 2005 winner of the press freedom award 
by Reporters sans Frontieres. <b>Mr</b> Yakmanish was reportedly beaten by two parliamentarians 
while covering a controversial debate about media reporting of the commemoration of the 
Mujahideen victory over Russia at the parliament on 7 May 2006. A parliamentarian provoked 
fierce reactions when she made critical comments on the Mujahideen, and other members of the 
parliament threatened her with death. Two parliamentarians then reportedly assaulted Yakmanish 
to stop him filming the debate. 
 
9. On 25 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning reporter 
<b>Noorullah Rahmani</b> and cameraman <b>Qais Ahamd</b> of the privately-owned Tolo TV.  On 29 July 
2006, they were reportedly beaten by a dozen gunmen after covering a protest against the illegal 
appropriation of land in the Paghman district in Kabul. Allegedly, a parliamentarian, whose 
name is known to the Special Rapporteur, was involved in the illegal seizure of the land and the 
reprisal against the journalist. On 11 August 2006 the premises of Radio Isteqlal in Logar were 
set on fire. Furthermore, on 15 August 2006, Kamal Sadaat, BBC&#8217;s correspondent in the 
province of Khost, was attacked by a group of gunmen. It was also reported that, on 16 August 
2006, several members of the parliament&#8217;s lower house (the Wolesi Jirga), staged a walk-out 
from the assembly and refused to return to the parliamentarian session until Tolo TV was evicted 
from the Parliament. Later on, parliamentarians agreed to allow the Wolesi Jirga Commission for 
Culture, Religious Affairs and Higher Education to address this issue. The said Commission was 
expected to discuss with parliamentarians as well as with representatives of Tolo TV in the 
coming days. Allegedly, no private TV stations were allowed to attend and film any 
parliamentarian session until the Tolo TV issue was resolved. Moreover, Abdul Qudoos, a 
journalist of radio Sada-e-Suhl in Parwan had allegedly been detained for more than seven 
months without any evidence. <b>Mr</b> Qudoos had been accused by a parliamentarian of an attempt </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1

to murder. Reportedly, the parliamentarian had tried to close the radio station, which she regards 
as a propaganda tool in the service of her political rivals. 
 
10. On 17 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning the 
photojournalist <b>Gabriele Torsello</b>, who was kindnapped on 12 October 2006 by armed men 
while traveling from Lashkar Gah to Kandahar. The identity and the intentions of those who 
kidnapped the journalist were unclear.  Some sources stated that calls to his mobile phone were 
answered by a man saying that the Italian journalist was in the hands of Taleban militants and 
that he was abducted on charges of spying. 
 
<b>Observations 
</b> 
11. At the time this report was finalized, the Special Rapporteur had not received any replies 
to the communications sent. The Special Rapporteur therefore invites the Government to respond 
to these allegations.<b>

</b>12. Le 25 janvier 2006, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a envoy&#233; un appel urgent sur <b>Bachir El Arabi</b>, 
correspondant du quotidien <i>El Khabar,</i> qui, le 21 janvier 2006, aurait &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233; par la police en 
ex&#233;cution d'un jugement par contumace prononc&#233; contre lui le 29 septembre 2005, le 
condamnant &#224; un mois de prison ferme pour diffamation.  Le journaliste aurait &#233;t&#233; en suite 
transf&#233;r&#233;  &#224; la prison d'Ain Safra.  Bachir El Arabi aurait publi&#233; un article sur la cession, par les 
autorit&#233;s locales, d&#8217;un terrain assign&#233; &#224; titre personnel au pr&#233;sident d'une association locale.  
Pour cette affaire, le directeur d<i>'El Khabar</i>, <b>Ali Djerri</b> et le fonctionnaire <b>Radja&#226; El Houari</b>, 
accus&#233;s d'avoir fourni au journaliste les documents appuyant les faits relat&#233;s dans l'article, 
auraient &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; condamn&#233;s, respectivement &#224; une amende de 50,000 dinars alg&#233;riens (550 
euros) et &#224; un mois de prison ferme. <b> 
 
</b>13. Le 20 f&#233;vrier 2006, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a envoy&#233; un appel urgent sur le caricaturiste <b>Ali 
Dilem </b>qui,<b> </b>le 11 f&#233;vrier 2006,  aurait &#233;t&#233; condamn&#233;  &#224; une ann&#233;e de prison ferme et 50 000 dinars 
(550 euros) d'amende, par la Cour d'appel d'Alger, pour avoir mis en cause le Pr&#233;sident de la 
R&#233;publique dans des termes injurieux et diffamatoires avec plusieurs caricatures parues dans le 
quotidien <i>Libert&#233;</i>, en automne 2003.  La Cour d'appel aurait ainsi durci la condamnation du 
Tribunal de premi&#232;re instance qui avait d&#233;j&#224; condamn&#233; le caricaturiste &#224; 50 000 dinars d'amende 
sans prononcer aucune peine de prison ferme. M. Dilem a d&#233;j&#224;  fait l&#8217;objet d&#8217;une lettre 
d&#8217;all&#233;gation et d&#8217;un appel urgent envoy&#233;s respectivement les 14 juillet 2004 et 17 juin 2005 par 
le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la promotion et la protection du droit &#224; la libert&#233; d&#8217;opinion et 
d&#8217;expression. &#192; ce jour, Ali Dilem serait poursuivi dans 24 affaires de presse et aurait &#233;t&#233; 
condamn&#233; &#8211; toutes peines confondues &#8211; &#224; plus de neuf ans de prison.<b> 
 
</b>14. Le 26 mai 2006, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, conjointement avec le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur 
l&#8217;ind&#233;pendance des juges et des avocats, et la Repr&#233;sentante sp&#233;ciale du Secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral sur la 
situation des d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l'homme, a envoy&#233; un appel urgent sur la situation de 
<b>Amine Sidhoum Abderramane</b>, avocat alg&#233;rien et d&#233;fenseur des droits de l&#8217;homme, membre 
de l&#8217;organisation non-gouvernementale (dor&#233;navant ONG) SOS Disparus, qu&#8217;aurait re&#231;u des

la veille de son intervention au nom de la F&#233;d&#233;ration Internationale des Droits de l&#8217;Homme 
(FIDH) sur la situation des droits de l&#8217;homme au continent et notamment sur les cons&#233;quences de 
l&#8217;adoption de la Charte de r&#233;conciliation nationale en Alg&#233;rie, M. Sidhoum aurait &#233;t&#233; abord&#233; par 
un repr&#233;sentant de la d&#233;l&#233;gation alg&#233;rienne qui aurait tent&#233; de le dissuader de s&#8217;exprimer devant 
la Commission. Ce dernier lui aurait rappel&#233; que s&#8217;il persistait &#224; pr&#233;senter son intervention, il 
serait passible de trois &#224; cinq ans de prison d&#232;s son retour en Alg&#233;rie. Du fait de ces menaces, M. 
Sidhoum n&#8217;aurait pu intervenir oralement le 13 mai 2006.  Selon les informations re&#231;ues, ces 
menaces seraient li&#233;es &#224; l&#8217;article 46 de l&#8217;ordonnance du 27 f&#233;vrier 2006, portant sur la mise en 
&#339;uvre de la Charte pour la paix et la r&#233;conciliation nationale qui pr&#233;voit en effet une peine allant 
de trois &#224; cinq ans d&#8217;emprisonnement et une amende de 250 000 &#224;  500 000 dinars alg&#233;riens

<b>R&#233;ponses du Gouvernement

15. Le 3 avril 2006, le Gouvernement a r&#233;pondu &#224; la communication du 25 janvier 2006, 
envoy&#233;e par le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial. Le Gouvernement informe que <b>Bachir Larabi</b> a publi&#233; un 
article, dans le quotidien <i>El Khabar</i>, intitul&#233; &#171; nouvelle s&#233;rie de scandales &#224; Naama pour 
accaparer mille m&#232;tres carr&#233;s au nom de l&#8217;association Diar El Rahma &#187;. S&#8217;estimant diffam&#233;, le 
pr&#233;sident de cette association caritative a d&#233;pos&#233; plainte avec constitution de partie civile le 17 
d&#233;cembre 2003 devant le juge d&#8217;instruction du Tribunal de Naama.  L&#8217;information judiciaire 
termin&#233;e, l&#8217;affaire est renvoy&#233;e par le juge d&#8217;instruction devant le Tribunal, &#224; son audience du 7 
juin 2005.  En l&#8217;absence du pr&#233;venu qui s&#8217;est fait repr&#233;senter par son avocat, l&#8217;affaire est 
renvoy&#233;e pour comparution de celui-ci devant le Tribunal, &#224; l&#8217;audience du 21 juin 2005, puis &#224; 
celle du 12 juillet 2005 et enfin &#224; celle du 20 septembre 2005.  Persistant son refus de 
compara&#238;tre devant le Tribunal, le pr&#233;venu a &#233;t&#233; condamn&#233; par d&#233;faut &#224; la peine de 1 mois de 
prison ferme et &#224; une amende de 50 000 DA. Le 21 novembre 2005, notification de ce jugement 
est faite &#224; la personne du pr&#233;venu qui n&#8217;utilise pas les voies de recours qui lui sont offertes. Le 
22 novembre 2006, le pr&#233;venu est arr&#234;t&#233; et plac&#233; en d&#233;tention, en ex&#233;cution de la d&#233;cision du

Suivi des communications pr&#233;c&#233;demment transmises  
 
</b>16. Le 4 janvier 2006, le Gouvernement a r&#233;pondu &#224; la communication du 23 septembre 2005, 
envoy&#233;e par le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, conjointement avec le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la question de la 
torture et la Repr&#233;sentante sp&#233;ciale du Secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral concernant la situation des d&#233;fenseurs 
des droits de l'homme. Le Gouvernement informe que l'action de l'Alg&#233;rie dans le domaine des 
droits de l&#8217;homme s'est caract&#233;ris&#233;e par la poursuite de son adh&#233;sion aux Conventions 
internationales de promotion et de protection des droits de l'homme, une pr&#233;sence active au sein 
des organismes internationaux et r&#233;gionaux de protection de ces droits et une coop&#233;ration 
soutenue avec les m&#233;canismes de la Commission des droits de l'homme des Nations Unies. La 
d&#233;marche alg&#233;rienne s'est aussi mat&#233;rialis&#233;e par une ouverture aux ONG internationales actives 
dans le domaine des droits de l'homme. Les nombreuses visites qu'elles ont effectu&#233;es en Alg&#233;rie </p>

leur ont globalement permis de se rendre compte, sur place, de la r&#233;alit&#233; de la situation des droits 
de l'homme.  Plusieurs repr&#233;sentants d'ONG ont s&#233;journ&#233; &#224; de nombreuses reprises en Alg&#233;rie 
durant les ann&#233;es 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 et 2005.  S'agissant des faits all&#233;gu&#233;s, il convient de 
souligner ce qui suit: <b> 
</b></p>
<p>I. depuis des ann&#233;es d&#233;j&#224;, des familles de pr&#233;sum&#233;s disparus se pr&#233;sentent r&#233;guli&#232;rement 
devant le si&#232;ge de la Commission Nationale Consultative de Promotion et de Protection 
des Droits de l'Homme (CNPPDH) et sont re&#231;ues, &#224; chacune de leurs demandes, par les 
responsables de la Commission; 
</p>
<p> 
II. la manifestation, non autoris&#233;e, du 22 septembre 2005 &#224; Constantine, &#224; laquelle il est fait 
</p>
<p>r&#233;f&#233;rence, a voulu emp&#234;cher le bon d&#233;roulement d'un meeting du Chef de l'&#201;tat dans le 
cadre du projet sur la Charte pour la paix et la r&#233;conciliation nationale; les personnes 
interpell&#233;es par la police judiciaire &#224; Constantine en raison de leur action d'emp&#234;chement 
ill&#233;gal d'un rassemblement pacifique, ont toutes &#233;t&#233; rel&#226;ch&#233;es quelques heures apr&#232;s leurs 
interpellations, intervenues dans le strict respect de la loi et de la r&#233;glementation en 
vigueur pour &#233;viter les troubles &#224; l'ordre public. Comme les auteurs de l'appel urgent 
peuvent le constater, il ne s'agit nullement d'action n&#233;cessitant le recours &#224; l'usage d'un 
vocabulaire sugg&#233;rant une violation flagrante, syst&#233;matique et g&#233;n&#233;ralis&#233;e des droits de 
l'homme. Le Gouvernement alg&#233;rien poursuivra son action de promotion et de respect des 
droits de l'homme et de coop&#233;ration avec les m&#233;canismes comp&#233;tents de la Commission 
des droits de l'homme. S'agissant de la prise en charge de la question des disparus, l'Etat 
alg&#233;rien a assur&#233;, depuis 1995, le traitement de cette question dans le cadre des 
dispositions l&#233;gislatives et r&#233;glementaires en vigueur, puis par la mise en place 
d'organisations administratives sp&#233;cifiques, d'une part, au niveau du Minist&#232;re de 
l'Int&#233;rieur pour recenser les all&#233;gations de disparitions sur l'ensemble du territoire 
national et, d'autre part, au niveau du Minist&#232;re de la justice par la mise en place d'un 
comit&#233; charg&#233; de recenser, de centraliser et de donner suite aux plaintes adress&#233;es par les 
familles concern&#233;es aux juridictions.  Dans le cadre de la mise en &#339;uvre de la concorde 
civile, le Pr&#233;sident de la R&#233;publique, soucieux de mettre fin aux cons&#233;quences du 
terrorisme qui a durement frapp&#233; le pays depuis 1991 et de r&#233;aliser la prise en charge 
effective des d&#233;chirures occasionn&#233;es, a d&#233;cid&#233; de mettre en place une Commission ad 
hoc charg&#233; de lui faire des propositions concr&#232;tes pour une solution nationale 
consensuelle &#224; la question des disparus.La Commission Nationale Consultative de 
Promotion et de Protection des Droits de l'Homme,  conform&#233;ment &#224; son d&#233;cret de 
cr&#233;ation, a remis au Pr&#233;sident de la R&#233;publique, le 31 mars 2005, le rapport final assorti 
de ses recommandations. C'est ainsi que pour mettre un terme d&#233;finitif aux cons&#233;quences 
de la crise travers&#233;e par le pays, le peuple alg&#233;rien s'est prononc&#233; par r&#233;f&#233;rendum, le 29 
septembre 2005 avec une &#233;crasante majorit&#233;, en faveur de la Charte pour la paix et la 
r&#233;conciliation nationale, dont le projet a &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;sent&#233; par le Pr&#233;sident de la R&#233;publique, le 
14 ao&#251;t 2005. Les mesures qui seront adopt&#233;es &#224; l&#8217;issue de cette Charte permettront la 
prise en charge par L&#8217;Etat de l&#8217;ensemble des victimes et de leurs ayants droits, y compris 
les disparus.

des droits de l'homme, le 1er mars 2005.  Le Gouvernement informe que M. <b>Mesli Rachid</b> a fait 
l&#8217;objet d&#8217;une information judiciaire devant le juge d&#8217;instruction de la troisi&#232;me chambre 
d&#8217;instruction du tribunal de Sidi M&#8217;Hamed (Alger) des chefs d&#8217;appartenance &#224; une organisation 
terroriste activant &#224; l&#8217;&#233;tranger et apologie du terrorisme. Malgr&#233; plusieurs convocations adresses 
par le juge &#224; M. Mesli Rachid, celui-ci n&#8217;y a jamais r&#233;pondu, puis a quitt&#233; le territoire national. 
De ce fait, il a &#233;t&#233; consid&#233;r&#233; par la justice comme &#233;tant en fuite. La m&#234;me information judiciaire 
a concern&#233; &#233;galement et pour les m&#234;mes chefs d&#8217;inculpation <b>Khider Karim</b> et <b>Ladada 
Ibrahim</b>.  L&#8217;information termin&#233;e, le juge d&#8217;instruction a transmis le dossier &#224; la chambre 
d&#8217;accusation d&#8217;Alger qui, par arr&#234;t du 22 avril 2003, a ordonn&#233; le renvoi des trois pr&#233;venus 
devant le tribunal criminel d&#8217;Alger.  Le 17 mars 2004, cette juridiction rend un jugement par le 
quel elle acquitte purement et simplement Khider Karim et Ladada Ibrahim et, statuant par 
contumace (in absentia) condamne Mesli Rachid &#224; vingt ann&#233;es de prison. &#192; noter que le 
jugement rendu &#224; l&#8217;&#233;gard de Mesli Rachid n&#8217;est pas l&#233;galement ex&#233;cutoire car et conform&#233;ment 
aux dispositions de l&#8217;article 326 du Code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale, ce jugement et les proc&#233;dures 
ant&#233;rieures sont an&#233;antis de plein droit d&#232;s l&#8217;instant o&#249; le condamn&#233; se pr&#233;sente devant la justice. <b> 
 
</b>18. Le 3 avril 2006, le gouvernement a r&#233;pondu &#224; la communication envoy&#233;e par le 
Rapporteur sp&#233;cial le 19 mai 2005. Le Gouvernement informe que le droit &#224; l'information et la 
libert&#233; de la presse, consacr&#233;s par la Constitution alg&#233;rienne, sont consid&#233;r&#233;s par la loi comme 
un m&#233;canisme essentiel de surveillance et de protection des droits individuels et collectifs. &#192; 
cet &#233;gard, le remarquable d&#233;veloppement de la presse en Alg&#233;rie en a fait un levier r&#233;el dans la 
protection des droits de l'homme.  Outre la t&#233;l&#233;vision, la radio et l'agence de presse qui 
fournissent les prestations de service public, il existe actuellement 48 titres de quotidiens sur 
une centaine de publications. Cette multitude des titres et leur diversit&#233; font que toutes les 
sensibilit&#233;s et tendances politiques qui traversent la soci&#233;t&#233; alg&#233;rienne trouvent les moyens 
d'expression m&#233;diatique de leurs opinions.  Le tirage moyen est, au total, de 1,5 million 
d'exemplaires par jour. S'agissant des hebdomadaires, il existe 43 titres pour une moyenne 
g&#233;n&#233;rale de tirage de 1,4 million d'exemplaires par semaine. Enfin, l'on recense 20 autres 
p&#233;riodiques, bimensuels ou mensuels qui tirent globalement &#224; 300.000 exemplaires par mois. 
La masse des lecteurs est estim&#233;e &#224; 9 millions par semaine.  Les journalistes &#233;trangers sont 
r&#233;guli&#232;rement accr&#233;dit&#233;s en Alg&#233;rie. Cette accr&#233;ditation est g&#233;r&#233;e dans le cadre d'un 
m&#233;canisme sp&#233;cifique pour permettre plus de souplesse et de rapidit&#233; dans la gestion des 
demandes. Un examen statistique des demandes d'accr&#233;ditation fait ressortir que plus de 4 100 
journalistes repr&#233;sentant plus d'une centaine de pays et travaillant pour divers supports 
m&#233;diatiques ont s&#233;journ&#233; en Alg&#233;rie de 1999 &#224; juin 2004, dont une moyenne de cent (100) 
correspondants permanents.  Contrairement &#224; ce qui est rapport&#233; dans certains m&#233;dias, aucun 
journaliste alg&#233;rien n'a &#233;t&#233; condamn&#233; pour un d&#233;lit d'opinion ou dans l'exercice libre de son 
droit d'informer. Les rares cas de journalistes condamn&#233;s par la justice ont trait &#224; des affaires 
li&#233;es &#224; des proc&#232;s en diffamation ou pour diffusion de fausses nouvelles.  S'agissant des 
journalistes mentionn&#233;s dans la communication du Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, leur situation se 
pr&#233;sente comme suit : <b>Reda Belhadjoudja</b>, dit <b>Hakim Laalam</b>, a &#233;t&#233; poursuivi pour avoir 
commis, &#224; travers une s&#233;rie de publications, une offense au chef de l'Etat.  Apr&#232;s une 
information judiciaire, l'int&#233;ress&#233; a &#233;t&#233; jug&#233; et condamn&#233; le 17 mai 2005 par le Tribunal 
d'Alger &#224; une peine de deux mois de prison et 250 000 dinars alg&#233;riens d'amende.  Sur appel de 
l'int&#233;ress&#233;, la Cour d'Alger a confirm&#233; la d&#233;cision du tribunal, par arr&#234;t rendu la 16 novembre 
2005. <b>Fouad Boughanem</b>, directeur de la publication  <i>Le Soir d'Alg&#233;rie</i>  a publi&#233; le 8 d&#233;cembre 
2003, un article dans lequel il porte atteinte, selon le plaignant Mohammed Bedjaoui, &#224; l'honneur </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1

et la consid&#233;ration de ce dernier.  Sur plainte de ce dernier, Fouad Boughanem a &#233;t&#233; poursuivi en 
citation directe devant le Tribunal d'Alger lequel a rendu, le 18 janvier 2005, un jugement 
condamnant l'int&#233;ress&#233; &#224; la peine de deux mois de prison avec sursis et 10 000 dinars alg&#233;riens 
d'amende du chef de diffamation.  Par suite des appels interjet&#233;s par le minist&#232;re public et 
l'inculp&#233;, la Cour d'Alger a rendu un arr&#234;t le 7 d&#233;cembre 2005 par lequel elle condamne Fouad 
Boughanem &#224; six mois de prison avec sursis et 50 000 dinars alg&#233;riens d'amende.<b> 
 
</b>19. Le 20 juillet 2006, le gouvernement a r&#233;pondu &#224; la communication, envoy&#233;e par le 
Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, conjointement avec le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur<b> </b>l&#8217;ind&#233;pendance des juges et des 
avocats et la Repr&#233;sentante sp&#233;ciale du Secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral sur la situation des d&#233;fenseurs des 
droits de l'homme, le 26 mai 2006.  Le Gouvernement alg&#233;rien tient &#224; rappeler que l'Alg&#233;rie 
a inscrit dans sa Constitution un chapitre sur &#171; les droits et les libert&#233;s &#187; et un autre sur le 
&#171; pouvoir judiciaire &#187; et que les textes juridiques cit&#233;s dans ta communication, relatifs &#224; 
la mise en &#339;uvre de ta Charte pour la paix et la r&#233;conciliation nationale, sont conformes 
aux engagements internationaux contract&#233;s. Le respect int&#233;gral des droits du citoyen est 
pr&#233;serv&#233; aussi bien par l'Ordonnance que par les d&#233;crets d'application, et se trouvent &#234;tre 
compatibles avec les dispositions des trait&#233;s auxquels l'Alg&#233;rie est partie :<b> </b><i>La libert&#233; 
d'expression : </i>&#233;nonc&#233;e dans l'article 19 du Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et 
politiques stipule que &#171; l'exercice des libert&#233;s pr&#233;vues au paragraphe 2 dudit article 
comporte des devoirs sp&#233;ciaux et des responsabilit&#233;s sp&#233;ciales. Il peut en cons&#233;quence 
&#234;tre soumis &#224; certaines restrictions qui doivent toutefois &#234;tre express&#233;ment fix&#233;es par la 
loi et qui sont n&#233;cessaires au respect des droits d'autrui ou &#224; la r&#233;putation d'autrui et &#224; la 
sauvegarde de la s&#233;curit&#233; nationale, de l'ordre public, de la sant&#233; ou de la moralit&#233; 
publique &#187;.<b> </b>L'ordonnance du 27 f&#233;vrier 2006 n'&#233;met aucune objection &#224; l'exercice de ce 
droit clairement pr&#233;vu par l'article 41 de la Constitution, bien que la possibilit&#233; de le 
restreindre telle que vis&#233;e plus haut existe dans l'instrument international qu'est le Pacte 
International des droits civils et politiques.<b> </b>La libert&#233; d'association reste ouverte comme 
&#233;nonc&#233; par la loi organique relative aux associations &#224; caract&#232;re politique du 6 Mars 
1997, &#224; tous les citoyens jouissant de leurs droits civiques.<b> </b>Les restrictions &#233;nonc&#233;es dans 
l'Ordonnance ne sont pas nouvelles puisqu'elles figurent aussi bien &#224; l'article 42 de la 
Constitution alg&#233;rienne, que dans ladite loi organique en ses articles 3, 5 et 7. Elles 
concernent les personnes qui instrumentalisent la religion &#224; des fins criminelles ou celles 
qui pr&#244;nent la violence contre la nation et les institutions de l'Etat.  Il n'existe au monde aucune 
l&#233;gislation qui tol&#232;re la possibilit&#233; de l'exercice politique aux personnes qui se livrent &#224; de 
tels actes. Le Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques stipule &#224; ce sujet, au 
paragraphe 1 de l'article <i>5 </i>&#171; qu'aucune disposition du Pr&#233;sent Pacte ne peut &#234;tre interpr&#233;t&#233;e 
comme impliquant pour un Etat, un groupement ou un individu un droit quelconque de se 
livrer &#224; une activit&#233; ou d'accomplir un acte visant &#224; la destruction des droits et des libert&#233;s 
reconnus dans le Pr&#233;sent Pacte ou &#224; des limitations plus amples que celles pr&#233;vues audit 
Pacte &#187;<i>. </i>Par ailleurs, le paragraphe 2 de l'article 22 relatif &#224; la libert&#233; associative stipule que 
&#171; l'exercice de ce droit ne peut faire l'objet que des seules restrictions pr&#233;vues par la loi et qui 
sont n&#233;cessaires dans une soci&#233;t&#233; d&#233;mocratique dans l'int&#233;r&#234;t de la s&#233;curit&#233; nationale, de la 
s&#251;ret&#233; publique, de l'ordre public, ou pour prot&#233;ger la sant&#233;, ou la moralit&#233; publiques ou les 
droits et libert&#233;s d'autrui &#187;. Enfin, l'article 20 &#233;nonce de mani&#232;re claire que &#171; toute 
propagande en faveur de la guerre est interdite par la loi. Tout appel &#224; la haine nationale, 
raciale ou religieuse qui constitue une incitation &#224; la discrimination, &#224; l&#8217;hostilit&#233; ou &#224; la 
violence est interdit par la loi<i>. </i>Par cons&#233;quent, les affirmations selon lesquelles l'Ordonnance </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 12 
 
r&#233;tr&#233;cit l'activit&#233; des citoyens sont infond&#233;es et ne reposent sur aucun argument juridique 
recevable. Le droit d'acc&#232;s &#224; la justice et le droit d'exercer un recours sont &#233;rig&#233;s en droit par 
le Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques dans les paragraphes 1 et 5 de 
l'article 14. Il reste que ces derni&#232;res accord&#233;es aux justiciables se doivent de respecter les 
proc&#233;dures nationales, pr&#233;vues &#224; cet effet.  Le chapitre six de l'Ordonnance portant Charte 
pour la paix et la r&#233;conciliation nationale concerne la &#171; reconnaissance du peuple alg&#233;rien 
envers les artisans de la sauvegarde de la R&#233;publique alg&#233;rienne d&#233;mocratique et populaire &#187;. 
Pl&#233;biscit&#233; par le peuple alg&#233;rien, seule source de la l&#233;gitimit&#233;, le 28 septembre 2006 lors du 
r&#233;f&#233;rendum, il ne doit pas en cons&#233;quence &#234;tre d&#233;tach&#233; du contexte naturel dans lequel il est 
inscrit, et vise le traitement l&#233;gal, social et humain d'une situation fort complexe, induite par 
une d&#233;cennie de criminalit&#233; terroriste &#224; grande &#233;chelle.  La gouvernance d&#233;mocratique &#233;tant 
fond&#233;e sur le choix librement exprim&#233; par la majorit&#233; dans la soci&#233;t&#233;, cette disposition se 
propose en cons&#233;quence de prot&#233;ger le droit des citoyennes et des citoyens qui se sont

Observations 
 
</b>20. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial invite le Gouvernement &#224; r&#233;pondre aux communications 
envoy&#233;es le 20 f&#233;vrier 2006 et le 26 mai 2006.<b>

<p>21. On 19 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation regarding <b>Benicio 
Wedeinge</b>, the director of the public television station TPA in the southern province of Cunene 
and <b>Augusto Sebastiao Domingos Pedro</b>, the correspondent of the state-owned &quot;Jornal de 
Angola&quot; in the province of Bengo. According to the information received, on 16 July <b>Mr</b> 
Wedeinge was shot to death by an intruder, who broke into his home in Onjiva. In a separate 
incident, on 8 July 2006, Augusto Sebastiao Domingos Pedro was killed in a tussle while visiting 
the capital Luanda.  Reportedly, it is unclear whether the two murders were related to the 
professional activity of the victims.  
 
22. On 16 of August 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal 
concerning the ban of <b>Mpalabanda</b> (Associa&#231;&#227;o C&#237;vica de Cabinda), the only human rights 
organization operating in Cabinda. Since its creation in 2003, the organization had reportedly 
been involved in the documentation of human rights violations committed by both the 
Government of Angola and members of the Front for the Liberation of the Cabindan Enclave 
(FLEC). Reportedly on 20 July 2006, in a case instituted by the Angolan government against 
Mpalabanda, the Provincial Court of Cabinda reportedly ruled that the said association should be 
banned. Mpalabanda had appealed against the decision, which was apparently based on the Law 
of Associations of May 1991 (Lei das Assosia&#231;&#245;es de Maio de 1991). Concerns were expressed 
that the court ruling against Mpalabanda represented an attempt to prevent the organisation from </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 13 
 
carrying out its legitimate work in defence of human rights. Furthermore, concern was expressed 
that the ban would seriously affect all human rights defenders in Cabinda and their ability to 
carry out human rights monitoring work and evaluation. 
 
23. On 30 November 2006, the Special Rapporteur jointly with the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders sent a letter of allegation 
concerning <b>Mr Ra&#250;l Danda</b>, a journalist and spokesperson of the above-mentioned association 
Mpalabanda (Associa&#231;&#227;o C&#237;vica de Cabinda), which had been subject of a joint urgent appeal 
sent by the Special Rapporteur and the Special Representative. According to the information 
received on 29 September 2006, Mr Danda was reportedly arrested, searched and detained, with 
no legal order, by agents identified as members of the Provincial Criminal Investigation Police 
(DPIC. According to DPIC representatives, the detention was justified as &#8220;flagrante delicto&#8221;, due 
to the fact that Mr Danda was allegedly carrying documents calling for the separation of Cabinda 
from Angola, and defaming the President. However, the lawyers of Mr Danda reportedly 
claimed that these were already published opinion articles about Cabinda, an unfinished draft 
article by Mr Danda himself and an invitation to traditional authorities in Cabinda (Kotolikanda). 
On 2 October 2006, <b>Mr</b> Danda was reportedly heard by the Deputy Provincial Prosecutor who 
legalized Mr Danda&#8217;s detention without specifying its duration. The alleged basis for the 
decision was &#8220;instigation, provocation and apology for crimes against state security&#8221; in violation 
of article 27 of Law on Crimes against State Security 22C/92 of 9 September 1992.. It is also 
reported that Mr Danda's lawyers had difficulties in accessing their client.On 27 October 2006 
Mr Danda was reportedly conditionally released. Concerns were expressed by the Special 
Rapporteur that the search, arrest and detention of Mr Danda may have been in relation to his 
legitimate activities in the defence of human rights in the Cabinda region. 
 
<b>Replies from the Government 
 
</b>24. By letter dated 27 July 2006, the Government replied to the communication of 19 July 
2006, whereby it stated that in accordance with preliminary investigations, the deaths of Mr 
<b>Benicio Wedinge</b> and Mr <b>Augusto Sebastiao</b> <b>Domingos Pedro</b> were not politically motivated 
or related to their work as journalists. The Special Rapporteur would appreciate being kept 
informed of the developments and outcome of the investigation into both deaths.

</b>30. On 11 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>Mr Arman 
Babadzhanian</b>, editor-in-chief of the newspaper Zhamanak Yerevan (Yerevan Times). It was 
reported that, on 26 June 2006, Mr Babadzhanian was arrested for allegedly forging documents 
to avoid military service, an offence which would have occurred in 2002. The editor had been 
detained for more than two weeks without bail, and faced up to five years&#8217; imprisonment, at the 
time this communication was sent. Reports indicated that the Prosecutor General summoned Mr 
Babadzhanian for questioning as a witness in a criminal case, but jailed him instead on forgery 
charges. The editor&#8217;s lawyer immediately sought for his release while the case was pending, but 
the Prosecutor General refused the request. A few days prior to the arrest, Zhamanak Yerevan 
published an article questioning the independence of the Prosecutor General's office. 
 
<b>Observations

32. On 31 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal regarding the situation 
of <b>Michael Harvey</b> and <b>Gerard McManus</b>, journalists of the Melbourne based Herald-Sun 
Newspaper. Reports indicated that, on 20 February 2004, the two journalists disclosed in an 
article, information concerning a government plan to reject a supplementary benefit promised to 
war veterans. The information was allegedly revealed by a public servant, who had been accused 
of revealing government information, and as a result was facing trial. On 23 August 2005, Mr 
Harvey and Mr MacManus refused to obey the judge&#8217;s order to testify in the prosecution of Mr 
Kelly and refused to provide information that would have revealed their source. They referred to 
their duty as journalists to protect the identity of sources and their ethical obligation to protect 
them. On 23 August 2006, the Victoria Supreme Court rejected the appeal that Mr Harvey and 
Mr McManus had filed against a lower court order, charging them for failing to provide 
information in a criminal case before a Melbourne County Court. Reports indicated that they 
may face imprisonment as a result. 
 
<b>Observations

<p><b>Azerbaijan 
 
</b></p>
<p>34. On 9 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning <b>Fikret 
Huseynli</b>, journalist of the daily Azadlig. On 5 March 2006, Mr Huseynli was assaulted and 
kidnapped by unidentified men, in Badamdar district. He was taken to another location, where he 
was severely assaulted. He subsequently underwent an operation. Prior to the attack, Mr 
Huseynli had written articles on corruption at high levels of Azerbaijan authority, and in 
February, he received telephone calls from unidentified men, telling him to quit his job as a 
journalist. It was further reported that, in separate occasions, two other journalists working for 
Azadlig survived similar attacks. On 26 February 2005, Editors Ganimat Zahidov and Azer 
Ahmedov were also abducted by unknown assailants in Baku and beaten.  The assailants 
reportedly told them to stop publishing articles critical of the President. Concern was expressed 
that these attacks may have been directly linked to their work as journalists.  
 
35. On 10 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning <b>Samir 
Adygozalov</b>, editor-in-chief for <i>Boyuk Millat</i>. On 23 February 2006, a Nizami District Court 
sentenced him to one- year imprisonment  for libel and insult. Mr Adygozalov was reportedly 
charged in connection with an article he wrote on 15 September 2005, which accused the rector 
of Baku State University of being an ethnic Armenian and improperly using university funds to 
support the Armenian diaspora. Concern was expressed at the imposition of criminal sanctions 
for media-related offences. 
 
36. On 30 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning <b>Bahaddin 
Khaziyev</b>: editor-in-chief of the daily newspaper <i>Bizim Yol</i> and deputy chairman of the Popular 
Front Party. On 18 May, Mr Khaziyev was kidnapped and assaulted by unindentified men, who 
told him to stop writing critical articles. He was taken to the hospital in Baku, and remained in 
very serious condition with multiple fractures and severe bruising at the time the communication </p>

was sent. His leg was reportedly dislocated. Concern was expressed that the attack against Mr 
Khaziyev was directly linked to his journalistic work, particularly in light of reports indicating 
that he had been reporting on illegal trafficking and alleged corruption by a senior government 
official.  
 
37. On 25 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation regarding <b>Sakit 
Zakhidov</b>, reporter and satirist for the Baku-based daily <i>Azadliq</i>. On 23 June 2006, he was 
arrested. Charged of drug possession, he was transferred to a prison in the capital after spending 
almost a month in police detention. Since his arrest his health had steadily been worsening. He 
had been suffering from heart disease for many years and needs regular medical care. His arrest 
may have been connected to his satirical columns in <i>Azadliq</i>, in which he criticized President 
Aliyev and the Government. 
 
38. On 11 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal regarding Mr <b>Shahin 
Agabeyli</b>, editor of the newspaper <i>Milli Yol</i>. On 9 August 2006, Mr Agabeyli was arrested and 
held at a prison for failing to reply to summonses from the District Court of Nasimi. On 10 
August, he appeared before the court on four charges. In the first case, he was convicted of 
opposing resistance to the police officers who had arrested him. In the second case, he was found 
guilty of defamation for an article about corruption affaires within the Khatai Town Council, for 
which the court ordered the newspaper to pay the Council &#8364;600 of compensation. In the third 
case, he was sentenced to a one year in jail for allegedly insulting and blackmailing a former 
Parliament spokesman &#8211; whose name is known to the Special Rapporteur &#8211; who complained that 
the journalist prevented his re-election through the dissemination of false information concerning 
elections&#8217; irregularities. In the fourth case, the Minister of Interior sued Agabeyli for libel as the 
journalist allegedly merged his name with the one of a former police officer accused of serious 
crimes. 
 
39. On 3 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal regarding Mr <b>Eynulla 
Fatullayev</b>, editor of the newspaper <i>Realny Azerbaidjan</i>. On 26 September 2006, the Yasamal 
district court in Baku condemned Mr Fatullayev to two years of incarceration and a fine for 
allegedly libeling and insulting the Minister of Interior. In addition, <i>Realny Azerbaidjan</i> would 
have to pay another  fine to the Minister. The provision of the sentence regarding Mr 
Fatullayev&#8217;s imprisonment was suspended. The Minister of Interior launched the suit after the 
publication, in July 2006, of two articles on his alleged financial relations with a person who is 
believed to be involved in the killing of the founder and editor of the <i>Monitor</i> newspaper, Elmar 
Huseynov. Mr Fatullayev reportedly stopped the publication of <i>Realny Azerbaidjan</i> and of 
another newspaper <i>Daily Azerbaijan</i> belonging to his group due to the lack of security for 
journalists and staff working with newspapers. 
 
40. On 27 November 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning <b>ANS TV 
and Radio, </b>which was closed by a decree of the National Television Radio Council, on the basis 
of Article 22.4 of the Law on TV and Radio Broadcast. The Chief of the Council allegedly stated 
that should ANS TV and Radio not stop broadcasting voluntarily, police will enforce the 
Council&#8217;s decree, and that the frequencies of ANS TV and Radio will eventually be open for 
sale.

41. On 28 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression sent an urgent 
appeal regarding <b>Mr Nijat Huseynov</b>, a reporter for the daily<i> Azadlyg</i>. According to the 
information received, on 25 December 2006, Mr Nijat Huseynov was severely beaten by four 
unidentified men at a bus stop near his home in Baku. Mr Huseynov was immediately admitted 
to the Musa Nagiyev Hospital because of head and internal injuries and a minor knife lesion.  
According to the journalist, one of his aggressors followed him for several days prior to the 
assault. Reportedly Mr Huseynov had received threatening anonymous phone calls, in which the 
callers made reference to his investigative work. According to information received, the daily 
Azadlyg is close to opposition parties and has allegedly been the target of other attacks and 
harassment in the past. Lately, Mr Huseynov had enquired about allegations of corruption among 
Government&#8217;s officials. 
 
<b>Replies from the Government 
</b> 
42. By letter dated 5 December 2006, the Government responded to the communication of 3 
October concerning Mr <b>Eynulla Fatullayev</b>, editor of the newspaper <i>Realny Azerbaidjan.</i> The 
Government explained that the Minister of Internal Affairs launched three suits against the said 
daily, his editor and the <i>Daily Ayzerbaijan</i> on the ground that their articles insulted his 
personality and libelled him. On 26 September 2006, E. Fatullayev was condemned to two years 
of suspended imprisonment for libel and insult. Mr Fatullayev appealed the decision, and the 
Court of Appeal was said to consider the matter on 27 November 2006. The Special Rapporteur 
would appreciate to receive further information on the outcome of the appeal. 
 
43. By letter dated 10 October 2006, the Government replied to the communication of 30 May 
2006 concerning the assault against <b>Mr Khaziyev</b>, editor in chief of the daily newspaper <i>Bizim 
Yol.</i>   The Government informed about the investigations undertook by the Institute of Research 
Forensic Examination and of forensic-medical experts into the forms of aggression and the 
nature of the injuries of Mr Khaziyev. The Government stated that the General Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office was in charge of the criminal investigation underway at that time. The Special Rapporteur 
would appreciate receiving further information regarding the result of the investigation. 
 
<b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications

44. By letter dated 29 March 2006 the Government of Azerbaijan replied to the 
communication of 14 November 2005, stating that, according to the concluded investigations, no 
complaints were lodged in the Prosecutor&#8217;s Offices and police departments on the alleged cases 
concerning the journalists <b>Azer Aydin, Rey Kerimoglu, Anar Orujev, Shakir Izzetoglu, Nabi 
Alishey, Habiba Abdulla and Ruslan Bashirli</b>. It was reported that the journalist of the daily 
<i>Yeni Musavat</i>, Mahabbat Orujev, misused his competence while participating as an observer and 
intervened in the election process notwithstanding the notices of the members of the election 
Commission. He was brought to the Police Office of the Sabunchu district on the grounds of the 
Act issued to the police by the commission members. M. Orujev was released after receiving 
caution. The Government indicated that due to the absence of appropriate legislative norms on 
satellite broadcasting and the fact that current legislation does not specify such a competence of 
the National Television and Radio Council, the short-term activities of foreign television 
channels and information agencies in the Republic of Azerbaijan are not permitted. However, 
despite the prohibition by the National Television and Radio Council for such services, </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 20 
 
appropriate conditions to use the satellite services of the local television channels were created. 
The Government finally explained that the Russian TV company &#8220;Mir&#8221;, Turkish &#8220;Ihlas&#8221; and 
&#8220;Dogan&#8221; agencies provided live broadcasting by means of the transmitter; other foreign 
television channels provided their satellite broadcasting through local televisions of the Republic 
of Azerbaijan.  
 
45. By letter dated 17 July 2006, the Government of Azerbaijan responded to the urgent

Government stated that Mr Aliyev, Former Minister of Health, had committed actions aimed at 
bringing down the state, and previously a warrant for his arrest had been issued for alleged 
embezzlement and abuse of power.  It was noted that as a result of a criminal case initiated by 
the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, on 21 and 22 October 2005 a warrant was issued for the arrests of Mr 
Aliyev and Mr Insanov in accordance with articles 28, 220.1 and 278 of the Criminal Code.  The

their whereabouts. Their relatives were not allowed to attend their trial session on 26 February 
2006. The trial has been postponed to 12 March 2006 and the above- named persons remain in 
custody. Concern was expressed that the arrests, detentions and mistreatment of the above- 
named persons might be connected with their activities in defence of human rights. 
 
48. On 31 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning <b>access

<b>website</b> (http://www.bahrainrights.org) was reportedly blocked by Batelco, Bahrain's main 
Internet service provider. It had been reported that this action could be linked to the website's 
coverage of a political scandal known as &quot;Bandargate&quot;, in which allegedly several government 
officials and members of the Royal family had been accused of planning to unfairly influence the 
upcoming elections. 
 
<b>Replies from the Government 
 
</b>49. By letter dated 18  May 2006, the Government of the Kingdom of Bahrain replied to the 
communication dated 9 of March 2006. The Government explained that the arrest of the <b>seven 
protestors</b> mentioned above took place as they failed to disperse in a peaceful manner the 
protest against court judgements against a number of defendants arrested for committing 
offences under the Criminal Code. The arrested persons were questioned by police and later on 
by the Department of Public Prosecutions. Some of them admitted their participation in the 
rioting. The Department of Public Prosecution concluded the release of 6 accused, due to the 
lack of sufficient evidence and ordered the detention of seven of the accussed. On 19 April 2006, 
the court issued a judgement, sentencing each of the accused to a one -year imprisonment for 
participating in a riot and commit illegal acts of sabotage. During the proceedings, the accused 
were guaranteed legal safeguards and their families had been informed about their whereabouts 
and were present during the proceedings.

<b>Chinghla Mong Chak</b>, leaders of PCJSS, had to flee, as they were targetted by the offenders. 
During the attack, the local police and local army reportedly didn&#8217;t intervene. It was alleged that 
the deputy for security of the PCJSS conference, a Police Sub-Inspector, and a group of 
policemen were deployed in the Conference hall but didn&#8217;t react to the violence.  
 
<b>Replies from the Government 
</b> 
55. By letter dated 27 of February and 9 June 2006 the Government responded to the 
communication of 22 of February 2006 concerning the assault of <b>Mr Mamun and Mr Ahmed</b>, 
journalists of the <i>Dainik Mathabhanga</i> daily. According to the confession of the accussed

communication of 31 of May 2006 regarding the allegation of an <b>assault on 25 jounalists </b>while 
participating in a demonstration.  The Government explained that Mr Islam, the president of the 
BNP political partiy (<i>Kushtia District Bangladesh Nationalist Party) </i>and former Member of the 
Parliament) had lodged a case against three journalists, accused of demanding money under the 
threat of publishing defamatory information about him. On 9 of May 2006 the Kushtia Reporters 
Units organized a protest against Mr Islam, during which Mr Chowdhry and his other collegaus 
were injured by some individuals who threw stones at the stage. The Government called for an 
emergency meeting on 17 July 2006, attended by the Deputy Minister of Information, Home 
Secretary, General Inspector of Police, three parliamentarians of Kusthia and prominent 
journalists including Mr Iqbal Sobhan. The dispute was settled amicably and the charges against 
the journalists and the case submitted by Mr Chowdhury were droped.

<b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b> 
57. By letter dated 13 February 2006, the Government of Bangladesh responded to the urgent 
appeal sent on 3 May 2004 concerning the alleged attack on the offices of the <b>Human Rights 
Congress for Bangladesh Minorities (HRCHM)</b>. The Government stated that Advocate 
Rabindra Gosh rented an apartment for accommodation of HRCBM office, but there had been an 
ownership dispute over the apartment between two brothers, named Maksudur Rahman and late 
Mahamudur Rahman. It was explained that Maksudur Rahman got the power of attorney in 
connection with the management of the said apartment from his younger brother. After a dispute 
over the handing in of the apartment, Maksudur Rahman forcibly took over the possession of the 
apartment, broke the signboard of HRCBM office, and shifted computers, furniture and some 
other things. A complaint was submitted and a case was registered on 22 April 2004. The 
Investigating Officer (IO) prepared the seizure list of some items during the investigation. The 
Investigating Officer requested Mr Sohag to submit a medical certificate as regards an alleged 
assault on him but he did not. The Government noted that Mr Sohag was alone in the office at 
the time of occurrence and that it was incorrect to state that the Lalbagh Police Station, of Dhaka 
Metropolitan Police, refused to register Mr Sohag&#8217;s complaint. After investigation, IO submitted 
a charge sheet to the concerned Court against Mr Maksudur Rahman under Section 143, 448, 
323 and 506 of the Penal Code. The disposal of the case is pending with the court. It was 
indicated that the Police investigation took place lawfully and that reporting of Human Rights 
abuses against the minorities is nothing but a <i>malafide</i> distortion of fact. The Government 
assured that neither the Government office nor any political party is involved in this matter. 
 
<b>Observations 
</b>

<p><b>Belarus 
</b> 
59. On 1 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in Belarus, sent a letter of allegation concerning the cases detailed 
below. On 19 February 2006, <b>Waclaw Radziwinowicz</b>, correspondent for newspaper <i>Gazeta 
Wyborcza</i> was requested to return to Poland by border guards, who alleged that he was on a 
Government list of persons barred from entering Belarus. Mr Radziwinowicz was in possession 
of a valid Belarusian visa and accreditation from the Foreign Ministry. On 1 February 2006, the 
Police in Zhlobin town confiscated several hundreds copies of <b><i>Tovarishch</i>, the official 
newspaper of the Belarusian Communist Party</b>, without any reason. News agencies reported 
that the seized issue contained coverage of the 19 March 2006 Presidential Election campaign of 
the opposition leader Aleksander Milinkevich. Moreover, on 30 January 2006, the Police stopped 
an <b>Ukrainian television crew</b> at the border checkpoint of Novaya Huta and seized a video 
footage described by the Police as &#8220;antistate&#8221;. The crew was reporting on voter opinions in the 
run-up to the March presidential elections. The footage confiscated covered comments made by 
residents of the Gomel region who lamented that &#8220;they will not have a presidential election but a 
Lukashenko election&#8221;. Concern was expressed at the compatibility of these incidents with the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression, particularly in light of the upcoming presidential </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1

elections of 19 March 2006. Concern was furthermore expressed at what appeared to be a pattern 
of harassment directed at foreign journalists. On 9 and 14 December 2005, <b>Agnieszka 
Romaszewska</b>, journalist for Polish broadcaster <i>Telewizja Polska, </i>was refused entry into 
Belarus. In March 2005, <b>Adam Tuchinski</b>, Polish photojournalist for the weekly news magazine 
<i>Przekroj</i>, and <b>Marcin Smialowski</b>, a freelance Polish journalist, both with press accreditation 
and a visa to enter Belarus, were detained in Hrodna city. In addition, on 26 April 2005, Russian 
journalists <b>Alexey Ametov</b> of <i>Russian Newsweek</i> and <b>Mikhail Romanov</b> of <i>Moscow 
Komsomolets</i> were arrested when covering the Chernobyl Way demonstration and were 
sentenced to 10 days and 8 days of administrative detention for violation of public order. Finally, 
on 24 August 2005, two Georgian citizens: <b>Girgi Kandelaki</b>, journalist and activist for the 
Georgian movement Kmara, and producer <b>Luka Tsuladze, </b>were detained in Minsk.  
 
60. On 14 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint letter of allegation concerning 
several journalists who were reporting the arrest of an opposition candidate Alyaksandr Kazulin. 
On 2 March 2006, Alyaksandr Kazulin was arrested. Several Belarusian and foreign journalists 
were trying to film and report the arrest scene. Those journalists included <b>Siarhei Pulsha</b>, 
correspondent with <i>BelaPAN News Agency</i>; <b>Dmitry Madorsky</b>, correspondent for <i>Reuters</i>; <b>Aleh 
Ulevich</b>, correspondent for <i>Komsomolskaya Pravda</i>; <b>Siarhei Hryts</b>, correspondent to <i>Associated 
Press</i>; <b>Dzmitry Brushko</b>, correspondent for <i>Belhazeta weekly</i>; <b>Vasil Fiedasienka</b>, journalist; 
and <b>Yulia Darashkevich</b>., Journalist. Siarhei Pulsha, Dmitry Madorsky and Aleh Ulevich were 
reportedly severely beaten by a group of plain clothes policemen, while trying to film the 
incident. Siarhei Hryts, Dmitry Madorsky, Vasil Fiedasienka and Yulia Darashkevich were 
subsequently arrested and detained at the Kastrychnitski City District Deparment of Minsk. They 
were later released. Concern was expressed that the assault and arrests may have been an attempt 
to prevent them from carrying out their legitimate journalistic work, particularly in light of the 
upcoming presidential elections of 19 March 2006.  
 
61. On 17 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal regarding the 
targeting of <b>various journalists and media outlets, human rights defenders and members of 
the political opposition</b> in relation to their work in the run up to 19 March 2006 elections. On 15 
March 2006, <b>Andrei Pisalnik, </b>editor of the newspaper <i>Glos Znad Niemna na Uchodzstwie,</i> was 
arrested in Grodno, sentenced to five days in prison and charged with hooliganism for allegedly 
swearing in public. On 13 March 2006, <b>Andrei Pochobut, </b>editor of the magazine <i>Polski na 
Uchodzstwie</i>, was arrested under unclear circumstances and charged with petty hooliganism; he 
was sentenced to 10 days' imprisonment. Both Polish-language publications are distributed to the 
Polish ethnic minority in Belarus. On 15 March 2006,<b> Valery Shchukin, </b>correspondent for the 
opposition newspaper <i>Narodnaya Volya</i>, was arrested while seeking accreditation to cover the 
presidential vote. He was charged with insulting members of the Vitebsk election commission 
and sentenced to seven days in jail for hooliganism. Furthermore, on 15 March 2006, police 
detained <b>Viktor Yaroshuk</b>, reporter for the independent newspaper <i>Myastsovy Chas</i>. A local 
court sentenced him to five days' imprisonment under unclear circumstances and charges. On 14 
March 2006, police officers seized the entire press run of <i>Narodnaya Volya </i>as the newspaper 
staff was transporting copies from its publisher. Police also confiscated the <i>Narodnaya Volya</i> 
newspaper of 14 March. In addition, during the night of 14 and 15 March 2006, <i>Channel 5</i> 
reporter <b>Andriy Zhigulin</b> and Cameraman <b>Vitaly Doroshchenko</b> were stopped at the border 
between Ukraine and Belarus, detained by Belarusian border guards for more than two hours, 
and were forced to return to Ukraine despite holding the necessary documents to work in </p>

Belarus. Moreover, on 13 March, a printing house in Smolensk, Russia, informed the <b><i>Deolvaya 
Gazeta</i></b>  and <b><i>Tovarishchnewspapers</i></b>  that their contracts had been terminated for economic and 
political reasons. On 12 March 2006 in Minsk, <b>Hanna Horozhenko</b>, reporter for the Kyiv-based 
<i>Channel 5</i>, accredited by the Belarusian Foreign Ministry to cover the presidential election 
campaign, was arrested, along with her cameraman <b>Leonid Leonidov</b> while covering a meeting 
held by opposition candidate <b>Alyaksandr Milinkevich</b>. She was later released. On 10 March, 
the Higher Economic Court temporarily suspended the independent newspaper <b><i>Zgoda</i></b>  following 
a complaint filed by the Information Ministry. Furthermore, on 9 March 2006, <b>Vinchuk 
Vyachora</b>, member of the campaign team of opposition presidential candidate Alexander 
Milinkevich, was sentenced to 15 days&#8217; detention for organizing an unsanctioned meeting 
between the candidate and voters. <b>Aleksandr Pavlovskii</b>, <b>Petr Babarenko</b>, <b>Alexander Zelko</b>, 
<b>Dmitrii Kudryavstev</b>, <b>Petr Topar</b>, <b>Vladimir Gribin</b>, <b>Aleksej Makovich</b>, <b>Sergei Pyantsevich</b> 
and <b>Artem Litvinko</b>, members of the political opposition were also sentenced to 15 days&#8217; 
detention for the same offence. In addition, on 1 March 2006, <b>Tatiana Protko</b>, chair of the 
Belarusian Helsinki Association (BHC), was accused of tax evasion and the organization faced a 
potential fine of US$70,000 and probable closure.  These charges were first made in January 
2004, and the subsequent two court decisions in 2004 confirmed that the organization&#8217;s activities 
were lawful and complied with all procedures as required by the Belarusian authorities. Despite 
this, a criminal investigation into the alleged tax evasion continued until the end of December 
2004, when the charges were dropped, but were then again renewed in 2006. Furthermore, on 21 
February 2006, <b>Mikalay Astreyka</b>, <b>Enira Branizkaya</b>, <b>Alyaksandr Shalayka</b>, and <b>Tsimafey 
Dranchuk</b>, members of an unregistered organization called the Initiative Partnership (IP), which 
carries out independent election monitoring, were detained by Belarusian KGB officers. They 
were charged with acting in the name of an unregistered organization and they could face 
possible maximum prison sentences of three years. They were formally charged on 3 March 
2005 and were in detention at the time this communication was sent. KGB officers also raided 
and searched the organization&#8217;s regional offices. The Special Rapporteur expressed deep concern 
at the restrictions and harassment of the above-mentioned persons and bodies, particularly in 
light of the upcoming elections and the, therefore, imminent need for free, independent and 
objective monitoring and reporting necessary for any democratic elections.  
 
62. On 23 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal regarding <b>Malkhaz 
Songulashvili</b>, Bishop of the Baptist church; <b>Basil Kobakhidze</b>, Archipriest of the Orthodox 
Church; and a scholar on religious studies <b>Lado Gogiashvili</b>, all citizens of Georgia. According 
to the information received, the three above-mentioned persons were arrested on 20 March 2006 
at a protest rally organized by Belorussian opposition to oppose the presidential elections that 
took place on 19 March 2006. They were held incommunicado without charges by the 
Committee for State Security in Minsk. It was also alleged that Representatives of the Georgian 
diplomatic corps as well as their family and relatives were refused access to them. They were 
released on 22 March 2006, and were deported to Ukraine on the same day. Serious concern was 
expressed at the numerous reports on the arrests, detentions, ill-treatment and deportation against 
individuals who participate in protest rallies, members of the political opposition, journalists and 
other media personnel, and human rights defenders, before and after the presidential elections of 
19 March 2006.  
 
63. On 24 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal regarding <b>mass 
arrests of peaceful demonstrators</b> protesting against the election results of 19 March 2006 and </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 26 
 
calling for free and fair elections. On 24 March 2006, the police riot squad surrounded 
demonstrators in October Square in Minsk, separated journalists from the protestors, and 
forcefully dragged the protestors into trucks and drove them away. Approximately 300-400 
people were detained including at least three journalists <b>Tatsyana Snitka, Vadzim 
Kaznacheeu, </b>and<b> Tatsyana Vanina, </b>members of the Belarusian Association of Journalists, and 
45 minors. They were taken to a pre-trial detention centre and were not allowed access to 
defence counsel. The minors, who were released later, reported that they and other detainees 
were beaten by the police. Journalists were not allowed to enter the camp where the protestors 
were being dragged away from their tents, while the police forced the protestors into the vans; 
neither were they allowed to approach the trucks where the protestors were taken to before being 
taken away. Moreover, on the night between 19 and 20 March 2006, <b>108 persons</b> were arrested 
and detained, and on 21 March 2006, another <b>20 persons</b> were detained. Amongst the persons 
who were arrested were several dozen supporters who were bringing supplies to protestors. On

arrested and sentenced to 15 and 12 days' imprisonment respectively; the whereabouts of 
Alexander Dobrovolsky remained unknown at the date of this communication. Furthermore, 
many of the arrests were accompanied by beatings. Several minors, who were released by the 
police, suffered injuries. Reports indicated that a total of around <b>400 persons</b> were arrested and 
remained in detention, and were being held in police holding cells in Minsk under conditions 
which fell below international recognized standards of detention conditions. Others had been 
brought to the temporary isolator in Valadarski Street and to an isolator in Navinki village. Many 
were charged with administrative offences, including participation in unsanctioned meetings or 
hooliganism, which carries prison sentences of 10 to 15 days. A large number of demonstrators 
were students, who could face expulsion as a result. Concern was expressed that people were 
arrested and detained for peacefully expressing their political views. 
 
64. On 6 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal concerning Mr 
<b>Mariusz Maszkiecz</b>, human rights defender and former Ambassador of Poland to Belarus. Mr

information, on 24 March 2006 Mr Maszkiecz was arrested by Belarusian security forces in 
October Square, Minsk, along with many other peaceful protestors who had gathered to express 
their objections to the way in which the presidential elections were carried out. It was reported 
that Mr Maszkiecz was badly beaten and assaulted during his arrest and was sentenced to 15 
days' imprisonment. It was further reported that after his arrest, he was transferred to hospital as 
his health was deteriorating. It was alleged that under Belarusian law, Mr Maszkiecz&#8217;s stay in 
hospital would not be considered as part of his 15- day sentence and that after he was released 
from hospital, he would have to return to prison for 10 days.

of the Belarusian criminal code, and that if convicted of violating the latter article he might be 
sentenced to 7-12 years' imprisonment.  It was further reported that Mr Artur Finkevich is being 
kept in solitary confinement.  
 
66. On 8 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal regarding the arrest of 
M. <b>Alyaksandr Bukhvostov</b>, M. <b>Zmistser Dashkevich</b>, M. <b>Sergei Kalyakin</b>, M. <b>Alyaksandr

opposition presidential candidate Alyaksandr Milinkevich; the Chair of the Party of Belarusian 
Communists, Sergei Kalyakin; the leader of the Labour party, Alyaksandr Bukhvostov; and the 
leader of the Youth Front, Zmitser Dashkevich. On 27 April they were all tried and convicted for 
&#8220;organizing an unsanctioned meeting&#8221; under article 167 of the administrative code. Vintsuk 
Vyachorka, Alyaksandr Milinkevich and Alyaksandr Bukhvostov were sentenced to 15 days' 
imprisonment, and Sergei Kalyakin and Zmitser Dashkevich to 14 days. The five men were 
being held in a detention centre in Minsk at the time this communication was sent. Concern was 
expressed that people were arrested and remained in detention for peacefully expressing their 
political views. 
67. On 16 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal concerning Mr 
<b>Mikalay Astreyka</b>, Ms <b>Enira Branizkaya</b>, Mr <b>Alyaksandr Shalayka</b> and Mr <b>Tsimafey 
Dranchuk</b>, members of the organization Initiative Partnership, an organization that monitors 
elections. They had already been the subjects of two urgent appeals previously sent. On 4 August 
2006, they were charged for &#8220;organizing and running an unregistered organization that infringes 
the rights of citizens&#8221; and received prison sentences: Mr Mikalay Astreyka (two years), Mr 
Tsimafey Dranchuk (one year) , Ms Enira Branizkaya (six months) and Mr Alyaksandr Shalayka 
(six months).  
 
68. On 23 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning <b>Alyaksandr 
Kazulin</b>, leader of the Belarusian Socialist Democratic Party (Narodnaya Hramada), former 
presidential candidate and former rector of the Belarusian State University. According to the 
information, on 13 July 2006 Alyaksandr Kazulin was sentenced to five and a half years&#8217; 
imprisonment by the Moskkovsky District Court in Minsk, charged with the commission of the 
crime of &#8220;hooliganism&#8221; and &#8220;the organization of group activities that breach public order or 
active participation in similar activities&#8221;. Reportedly, the charge of &#8220;hooliganism&#8221; related to two 
separate events. The first was on 17 February, when a clash between members of Alyaksandr 
Kazulin&#8217;s party and the Special Purpose Police Unit took place, when MrKazulin was prevented 
from entering the National Press Centre, where he intended to hold a press conference.  The 
second event took place on 2 March, when Mr Kazulin was beaten and detained during his 
attempt to entry the Third All Belarusian People&#8217;s Assembly in Minsk, which was being 
addressed by President Lukashenko.  Later on, at the police Station, he was reportedly further 
beaten and denied medical treatment. The second charge was brought against him after the street </p>

demonstrations in Minsk to mark the Freedom Day on 25 March.  Following speeches in a public 
park, Alyaksandr Kazulin led protestors on a march to Akrestina prison, where participants of 
the demonstrations which followed the presidential elections on 19 March were detained. 
Government security forces reportedly used excessive force to break up the march. Alyaksandr 
Kazulin, along with hundreds of others, was then detained at Akrestina prison. 
 
<b>Replies from the Government 
</b> 
69. On 20 of June 2006, the Government replied to the communication of 6 of April 2006, 
stating that <b>Mr Maszkiewicz</b> had been found guilty under article 167-1, paragraph 1, of the 
Code of Administrative Offences of the Republic of Belarus for breaching the procedure for the 
organization and conduct of religious, sporting, or mass cultural or other entertainment events; 
and of meetings, rallies, street processions, demonstrations and pickets on 24 March 2006. He 
was placed in administrative detention for 15 days. On 29 March 2006, when his health started to 
deteriorate, Mr Maszkiewicz was hospitalized. By the decision of the court, the period of Mr 
Maszkiewicz&#8217;s administrative detention was counted from 23 March 2006, being counted as part 
of his sentence the period he spent in hospital. 
 
70. By letter of 25 of September 2006, the Government replied to the communication of 16 of 
August 2006 stating that <b>Mr Astreiko, Mr Dranchuk, Ms Bronitskaya</b> and<b> Mr Shalaiko</b> had 
been charged under article 193, part 1 of the Criminal Code, with the organization of or 
participation in the activities of another voluntary association which has failed to undergo State 
registration in the prescribed manner. The Government explained that the accused, under the 
auspices of the unregistered organization had prepared fictitious unreliable information 
pertaining to the conduct and results of the presidential elections in Belarus for distribution and 
publication. On 4 August 2006, the Central District Court of the city of Minsk, sentenced <b>Mr</b> 
Astreiko to two years&#8217; deprivation of liberty, <b>Mr</b> Dranchuk to a one- year&#8217;s deprivation of liberty 
and Ms Bronitskaya and <b>Mr</b> Shalaiko to six months&#8217; rigorous imprisonment. The verdict did not 
become enforceable, as appeals were submitted by <b>Mr</b> Astreiko and <b>Mr</b> Dranchuk and their 
counsel. A preliminary date of 15 September 2006 had been set for the case to be heard in Minsk 
city court. Ms Bronitskaya and <b>Mr</b> Shalaiko have been released from custody, having served the 
sentences imposed by the court. 
 
71. On 8 December 2006, the Government replied to the communication of 23 August 2006 
concerning <b>Alyaksandr Kazulin</b>, leader of the Belarusian Socialist Democratic Party 
(Narodnaya Hramada), former presidential candidate and former rector of the Belarusian State 
University. The Government conveyed the information received from the Supreme Court and the 
Procurator&#8217;s Office of the Republic of Belarus. It was noted that on 13 July 2006 <b>Mr</b> Kozulin 
was sentenced by the Moskovsky District Court in Minsk to five and a half years&#8217; deprivation of 
liberty in a special-regime correctional colony for multiple offences under article 339, paragraph 
2, and article 342, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Belarus. <b>Mr</b> Kozulin 
was found guilty of malicious hooliganism involving the use of violence, the destruction of 
property and resistance against a person attempting to stop an act of hooliganism (repeat offence) 
and organizing group activities constituting a gross violation of public order, involving blatant 
failure to comply with the lawful demands of representatives of the authorities and leading to the 
disruption of transportation and of the activities of the Na Nemige shopping centre, a Belarusian-
German joint venture, as well as actively participating in such activities. The Court found that, </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 29 
 
on 17 February 2006, <b>Mr</b> Kozulin, together with a group of citizens, attempted to enter the 
Minsk Concert Hall with intent to commit hooliganism, using physical force against two officers 
of the concert hall&#8217;s security service, <b>Mr</b> I.A. Salzhenikin and <b>Mr</b> A.N. Yakimovich, while they 
were going about their official duties, and insulting them and the chief of the security service. On 
2 March 2006, <b>Mr</b> Kozulin, acting with intent to commit hooliganism, broke the glass in a 
framed portrait of the President of the Republic of Belarus in the Internal Affairs Authority of 
Oktyabrsky district in Minsk. On 25 March 2006, in Yanka Kupala Square, Minsk, <b>Mr</b> Kozulin 
intentionally called on the persons gathered in the vicinity of the square to march without 
authorization to the temporary holding facility of the Central Department for Internal Affairs of 
the Minsk City Executive Committee.  Along the route of the march, this group of persons, led 
by <b>Mr</b> Kozulin, committed gross violations of public order, disrupted pedestrian and vehicle 
traffic and the activities of the Na Nemige shopping centre, a Belarusian-German joint venture, 
and used force against troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. <b>Mr</b> Kozulin&#8217;s guilt was 
confirmed by testimony from victims and eyewitnesses; by video recordings viewed during the 
hearing of evidence and showing the events that took place on 17 February 2006 in the lobby of 
the Minsk Concert Hall, on 2 March 2006 in the Internal Affairs Authority of Oktyabrsky district 
in Minsk, and on 25 March 2006 in Yanka Kupala Square and in the vicinity of Nemig Street, 
Bogushevich Square and Dzerzhinsky Prospect; by the findings obtained from the forensic 
medical examination of the victims; and by other evidence examined by the court and cited in its 
judgment. Defence counsel lodged an appeal to the Cassation Court against this judgment. The 
judgment was upheld by a decision of the Criminal Division of the Minsk City Court of 19 
September 2006, and the said appeal was dismissed. <b>Mr</b> Kozulin&#8217;s sentence thus became 
enforceable with the adoption of the Court of Cassation decision on his case (in accordance with 
article 399, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code). 
 
<b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
 
</b>72. By letter dated 1 February 2006, the Government of Belarus replied to the communication 
of 17 August 2005 concerning the situation of certain journalists. The Government indicated that 
on 5 August 2005, the Department of Citizenship and Migration of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs forwarded to the citizenship and migration office of the internal affairs department of the 
Grodno provincial executive committee an instruction concerning the need to deport the Polish 
citizen <b>Adam Tuchlinski</b> from the Republic of Belarus. It was reported that the reason of such a 
decision was because <b>Mr</b> Tuchlinski systematically engaged in illegal journalistic activities 
without the necessary accreditation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is a violation of 
the provisions of paragraph 9.4 and 24.7 of the Regulations governing the presence and 
professional activities in the territory of Belarus. The Government explained that <b>Mr</b> Tuchlinski 
was prohibited from entering Belarus for a period of five years. It was also reported that on 6 
August 2005 <b>Mr</b> <b>Marcin Smialowski</b> was travelling from Poland to Belarus with a group of 
persons whose entry into Belarus was restricted. Since these persons were refused entry into 
Belarus, <b>Mr</b> Smialowski, of his own free will, refused to enter the territory of Belarus on his 
own and returned to Poland. The Government of Belarus stated that under their Constitution, the 
right to hold meetings, rallies, street processions, demonstrations and picketing is inextricably 
linked with public security and the observance of the legally established procedures, which are 
set out in the Mass Events in Belarus Act of 30 December 1997. Persons who violate this 
procedure are subject to prosecution. It was reported that on 3 July 2005, approximately 30 
persons participated in an unauthorized gathering on Zelenaya Street. The Belarusian citizens </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 30 
 
<b>Andrzej Poczobut, Jozef Porcecki </b>and <b>Mieczyslaw Jaskiewicz</b>, who refused to comply with 
the legal demands of officials, organized and participated actively in the gathering. On 26 July 
2005, the Shchuchin district internal affairs office drew up a report of violations by the 
aforementioned persons of article 166 and 167-1 of the Code of Administrative Offences. On 27 
July 2005, pursuant to the decisions of the judge of the Lida district court, the following persons 
were held administratively liable for the commission of offences: Andrzej Poczobut was 
sentences to 15 days&#8217; arrest; and Jozef Porzechi and Mieczyslaw Jaskiewicz were each sentenced 
10 days&#8217; administrative arrest. Also the decision of 4 August 2005 sentenced Andrzej Pisalnik to 
10 days&#8217; administrative arrest. It was further reported that on 6 July 2005 the citizens Andrzej 
Poczobut, <b>Ivan Roman, Inesa Todryk, Andrzej Pisalnik </b>and<b> Igor Bancer </b>took part in 
picketing on Lenin Square in Grodno without the relevant prior authorisation from the local 
authorities to hold the event. They were detained and brought to the Lenin district internal affairs 
office in Grodno for examination and the court found the aforementioned individuals guilty of 
administrative offences. It was reported that they were sentenced an administrative penalty in 
form of a fine, and not an arrest. On 27 July 2005 <b>Mr</b> Kruczkowski requested the local 
authorities to assist him in creating conditions conductive to the preparation of a new congress. It 
was reported that officers of the Union of Poles in Belarus asked the citizens who were gathered 
to comply with the decree of the Ministry of Justice and vacate the premises. Their demands 
were ignored and threats with physical violence to <b>Mr Kruczkowski, Mr Kalosza, Mr 
Znajdzinski </b>and<b> Mr Niemiera</b> were carried out. <b>Siarhey Hryts, Inesa Todryk, Waclaw 
Radziwinowicz, Robert Kowalewski </b>and<b> Pavel Mazheika</b> were among the individuals arrested 
and taken to the Lenin dictrict internal affairs office. The Government indicated that after giving 
explanations, all the citizens were released within the established limits. The Government of 
Belarus stated that the consideration of the cases was not related to the aforementioned persons&#8217; 
involvement in political or public activities or with restrictions of their right to hold peaceful 
gatherings. 
 
73. By letter dated 6 January 2006, the Government of Belarus replied to the communication 
of 24 October 2005 concerning the killing of Mr <b>Grodnikov</b> and Ms <b>Cherkasova</b>, and the 
situation of the <b>newspaper<i> Narodnaya volya</i></b> . It was reported that on 18 October 2005 a report 
reached the duty desk of Zaslavl city internal affairs office in Minsk district indicating that 
Nikolai Petrovich Grodnev, having arrived at the home of his brother, Vasily Petrovich 
Grodnikov, found the latter&#8217;s body on the kitchen floor. Mr Grodnikov lived alone, did not work 
and for 15 years had followed a course of hypnosis to tackle his dependency on alcohol. Arriving 
at the house, Mr Grodnev knocked on the window and the door, so he broke the front door to get 
into the house. When he found the body he called the militia and informed his relatives. It was 
further reported that the forensic examination conducted on 19 October 2005 concluded that Mr 
Grodnikov had died as a result of a closed blunt trauma to the head, complicated by oedema and 
dislocation of brain tissue. The deceased had bruises and scratches and his blood was found to 
contain ethyl alcohol. An inquiry into Mr Grodnikov&#8217;s death was opened, and on 28 November 
2005 it was decided not to open a criminal case in the absence of anyone found to be responsible 
for his death. Given the lack of completeness of the inquiry, this decision was overturned on 29 
November 2005, and the case-file and written instructions were referred to the Minsk 
interdistrict procurator&#8217;s office for further inquiries. The conduct of the inquiry is being overseen 
by the Belarusian Procurator&#8217;s Office. Regarding the murder of Ms Cherkasova, the Government 
explained that a criminal case was opened on the basis of evidence of an offence contrary to 
article 139 of the Belarusian Criminal Code. Ms Cherkasova&#8217;s body was discovered on 20 </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 31 
 
October 2004 in her apartment with multiple stab and hack wounds. The investigation found 
that, between 1995 and 2000, Ms Cherkasova had written articles of a socio-political nature, 
specifically about the activities of religious sects in Belarus. On 19 October 2004, just before she 
died, Ms Cherkasova was working on her most recent interview, with a folk craftsman living in 
Minsk province. It was noted that the investigators researched various theories concerning Ms 
Cherkasova&#8217;s murder, but the line of inquiry of investigating her acquaintances and colleagues 
led nowhere. The Government indicated that a theory was put forward that the crime was 
connected with Ms Cherkasova&#8217;s professional activity, and that there were currently no grounds 
for supposing that she was killed on account of her work. It was reported that the investigation of 
the circumstances of Ms Cherkasova&#8217;s murder were continuing and that the Office of the 
Procurator-General of Belarus was overseeing the investigation of this criminal case. On the 
other hand the following facts have been established regarding the publication and dissemination 
of the newspaper <i>Narodnaya volya</i>. The Government stated that the contract to publish a 
newspaper that existed between the public limited company Krasnaya svezda and the unitary 
enterprise <i>Narodnaya volya</i> was terminated on 28 Septemeber 2005, the reason being that 
<i>Narodnaya volya</i> had breached paragraph 6.2 of the contract. The paragraph in question stated 
that, in the event of the client dishonouring the terms of payment, the executor contract was 
entitled to terminate the arrangement unilaterally. It was reported that according to Krasnaya 
zvezda, as at 28 September 2005 <i>Narodnaya volya</i> had run up a debt of 2,476 million rubles. On 
28 September 2005 the unitary enterprises Belsoyuzpechat and Mingorsoyuzpechat terminated 
their contracts with <i>Narodnaya volya</i> to distribute, forward and market the newspaper because 
information and articles were being published in the mass media that contravened the provisions 
of the Press and Other Mass Media Act. The Government stated that on 20 January 2005 the 
editorial office of the newspaper was cautioned by the Ministry of Information regarding a 
breach of article 32 of the Press Act. According to the information supplied by the Government, 
notwithstanding the fact that the editorial office has committed numerous breaches of Belarusian 
legislation, the Ministry of Information has not applied the measures specified in article 16 of the 
Press Act to <i>Narodnaya volya</i>.  
 
74. By letter dated 10 January 2006, the Government of Belarus responded to the urgent 
appeal sent on 16 November 2005 concerning <b>Vera Stremkovskaya</b>. The Government stated 
that in pursuance of the letter addressed to the Minsk city bar association on 26 October 2005 by 
the Office of the Procurator of the Republic of Belarus about ensuring the participation of 
lawyers in studying the materials of criminal case No. 0496637 regarding participants of the S.P. 
Morozov criminal organization, the director of the Minsk city bar association took a number of 
organizational measures to ensure the participation of lawyers in studying the said materials. 
Thus, the defence of the persons accused in this case was undertaken by 46 lawyers of the Minsk 
city bar association. It was noted that with a view to preventing delays and disruptions in the 
conduct of investigations into the criminal case, the Republican Bar Association recommended 
that the director of the Minsk city bar association should, as a temporary arrangement, cease to 
grant lawyers ordinary and special leave from 28 October 2005 for a period of one month. In this 
connection the acting chairman of the board of the Minsk city bar association took the 
appropriate decision on 28 October 2005 to stop the granting of leave. On 31 October 2005 the 
board of the Minsk city bar association received an application from Ms Stremkovskaya, to be 
granted leave for family reasons from 2 to 5 November 2005. The chairman of the board of the 
Minsk city bar association refused Ms Stremkovskaya leave, making reference to the above- 
mentioned bar association decision of 28 October 2005. The Government indicated that Ms </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 32 
 
Stremkovskaya did not submit an application for leave to participate in an international 
conference and that during her work in the Minsk bar association, she  repeatedly submitted 
applications to be granted short-term leave for family reasons and not once had she requested 
leave for the purpose of &#8220;participation in international conferences&#8221;, as stated in the 
communication of 16 November 2005. The Government also noted that the Republic of Belarus 
takes an active part in international conferences at the invitation of various international 
organizations. The Minsk bar association did not receive an invitation for Ms Stremkovskaya to 
participate in the international conference on the &#8220;Role of defence lawyers in guaranteeing a fair 
trial, in Tbilisi, Georgia. It was indicated that three lawyers from Belarus did participate in the 
aforementioned international conference. 
 
75. On 10 January 2006, the Government of Belarus replied to the communication of 7 
December 2005.  The Government indicated that in the drafting of the Act of the Republic of 
Belarus on amendments and additions to certain legislative acts of Belarus on the question of 
increasing responsibility for <b>acts directed against individuals </b>and public safety, account was 
taken of the experience and legislation of the Russian Federation and a number of European 
countries, particularly Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland. 
The Act establishes responsibility for activities by political parties, other voluntary associations 
and religious organizations that prevent citizens from fulfilling their State, public and family 
obligations (Criminal Code of the Republic of Belarus, article 193, paragraph 1, as amended by 
the Act).  This amendment is aimed at implementing the provision contained in article 16, 
paragraph 3, of the Belarusian Constitution, which prohibits the activities of religious 
organizations if such activities prevent citizens from fulfilling the above-mentioned obligations. 
The following information was highlighted by the Government: Article 193 of the Act 
establishes responsibility for the commission implementing the existing prohibitions in Belarus. 
The aim of the new article is to suppress the activities of political parties, voluntary associations, 
religious organizations and foundations, with respect to which an authorized State body has 
adopted a decision to dissolve (suspend the activities of) such parties, associations, organizations 
or foundations, and also those organizations that have not been re-registered in accordance with 
established procedure. Article 1931 of the Criminal Code establishes responsibility for failure to 
implement the decision of a court or other State body that prohibits or suspends the activities of a 
political party, other voluntary associations, religious sect or foundation, or a decision refusing 
the registration of an organization, which nevertheless continues to operate. Activities directed at 
removing the causes and conditions that served as grounds for suspending the activities of a 
party, other voluntary associations, foundation or religious organization, as well as activities 
relating to their registration, shall not constitute an offence. The article provides that persons 
who have voluntarily discontinued their illegal activities and who have informed the State 
authorities accordingly, for example, the procurator&#8217;s office or other law enforcement agencies, 
shall be exempted from criminal responsibility.  The Act provides for additional measures to 
maintain public order, the safeguarding of which directly involves the protection of the 
individual and his or her constitutional rights and legitimate interests.  To this end, articles 293 
and 342, which establish responsibility for mass disturbances and group violations of public 
order, are supplemented by norms establishing responsibility for acts involving the instruction or 
other training of persons for the purpose of participating in the commission of such offences.  
The Government of Belarus noted that in recent years, international practice has demonstrated 
the inadequacy of confronting global challenges and threats by force alone.  The Government's 
current aim is to create effective mechanisms to counter such challenges and threats proactively </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 33 
 
at an early stage.  The aim of the aforementioned amendments is to prevent offences in the 
preparatory stage by increasing responsibility for acts aimed at destabilizing public order and 
public safety in comparison with the general procedure for the legal assessment of such acts, 
described in article 13 of the Criminal Code.  The point at issue does not concern &#8220;any 
educational activity&#8221; or &#8220;mass events&#8221; but the purposeful training in how to organize mass 
disturbances involving violence, arson, massacres and destruction of property, as well as in how 
to organize and carry out armed resistance to the authorities.  The additions to the relevant 
articles of the Criminal Code do not apply to the preparation and conduct of unauthorized mass 
events (including meetings, rallies, street processions, demonstrations and picketing), when such 
events do not involve the organization of mass disturbances or group activities that seriously 
breach public order. The conduct of unauthorized mass events and the violation of the procedure 
for holding such events entail administrative responsibility, which is covered in article 1671 of 
the Code of Administrative Offences of 6 December 1984. Persons who finance such instruction 
and training, or create the material conditions necessary for this purpose, for example, by making 
available premises, training grounds, the necessary equipment and so forth, are subject to 
prosecution.  Similar additions are provided in the article establishing responsibility for the 
organization of, or participation in group activities that violate public order and involve blatant 
non-compliance with the legitimate demands of the authorities, or which disrupted the normal 
operation of transport, enterprises, institutions or organizations.  Article 357 of the Criminal 
Code establishes responsibility for seizing or retaining State power through unconstitutional 
means, as well as for conspiracy to that end. At present, other acts (except for conspiracy) that 
are directed at the seizure or retention of State power through unconstitutional means are subject 
to qualification as preparations for the seizure of State power or an attempt to commit that 
offence. As a result of the additions introduced by the Act to article 357 of the Criminal Code, 
the time of the completion of the offence provided for in that article is shifted to an earlier stage.  
Consequently, acts directed at the seizure or retention of State power through unconstitutional 
means shall be considered as completed offences. The Act also contains norms that provide for 
additional measures to protect the constitutional foundations of the Belarusian State and society, 
and to protect the Republic of Belarus from insults and various kinds of fabrications designed to 
undermine the prestige of our State and the international community&#8217;s confidence in it.  This 
norm has been included in paragraph 2, which supplements article 361 of the Criminal Code.  It 
establishes responsibility for public appeals for the overthrow or change of the constitutional 
system of the Republic of Belarus or for the commission of crimes against the State.  In 
accordance with the aforementioned addition, appeals to a foreign State or a foreign or 
international organization to commit acts that damage the external security of the Republic of 
Belarus, its sovereignty, territorial integrity or defence capacity, and also the dissemination of 
materials (written, electronic, audio-visual materials) containing such appeals, are recognized as 
offences.  Article 3691, entitled &#8220;Defamation of the Republic of Belarus&#8221;, establishes 
responsibility for providing a foreign State or a foreign or international organization with 
knowingly false information concerning the political, economic, social, military or international 
situation of the Republic of Belarus, or the legal status of its citizens. 
 
76. By letter dated 24 January 2006, the Government of Belarus replied to the communication 
of 10 October 2005 concerning the <b>newspaper <i>Narodnaya volya</i></b> . It was reported that on 28 
September 2005, the unitary enterprises Belsoyuzpechat and Mingorsoyuzpechat terminated 
their contracts with <i>Narodnaya volya</i> to distribute, forward and market this newspaper because 
information and articles were being published in the mass media which contravened the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 34 
 
provisions of the Press and Other Mass Media Act. The Government explained that on 20 
January 2005 the Ministry of Information sent a warning to the editorial office of Narodnaya 
volya concerning a violation of article 32 of the Press Act. An article entitled &#8220;Revelations of a 
former State security agent&#8221; contained an interview with one A.I.Rabets, described a former 
employee of the Committee for State Security. In reality, according to information received from 
the Government, Mr Rabets has never been employed by the State security agencies. He is 
currently wanted by the police in connection with a number of crimes. It was reported that on 31 
March 2005, 13 April 2005 and 11 May 2005 the Ministry of Information served warnings on 
<i>Narodnaya volya</i> for violations of article 32 of the Press Act. According to the information 
supplied by the Government, in spite of the fact that the editorial office of Narodnaya volya 
committed the aforementioned violations of Belarusian legislation, the Ministry of Information 
had not applied the measures specified in article 16 of the Press Act. It was reported that the 
Lenin district court in Minsk has heard the lawsuit brought by Belarusian citizen S.V. 
Haidukevich against Narodnaya volya in order to defend his honour, dignity and business 
reputation and to claim monetary compensation for moral damage. In his claim, Mr Haidukevich 
stated that an article which was published on 1 March 2005 contained untrue information that 
cast aspersions on his honour, dignity and business reputation. Materials on court insinuate that 
the claimant was a party to contracts for oil deliveries from Iraq and was in arrears in paying for 
them. Mr Haidukevich also requested the court to order the respondent to publish a refutation of 
the information that was published within 10 days after the court&#8217;s decision entered into force. 
He also sought monetary compensation from the respondent for moral damage. The court 
decision of 14 July 2005 met partly Mr Haidukevich&#8217;s claims: the court ordered Narodnaya 
volya to publish a refutation of the information that it had disseminated and was also ordered to 
pay Mr Haidukevich 100 million roubles in compensation for moral damage. The Government 
explained that since the debtor complied with the court decision, the ruling of 28 September 
2005 was withdrawn.

78. On12 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief 
and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, sent an urgent appeal concerning  two 
Christians <b>John Tamang alias Purna Bahadur Tamang</b> and <b>Benjamin Sharma alias Budhu 
Mani Dhungana</b>. According to the information, on 7 January 2006, John Tamang and Benjamin 
Sharma were arrested for screening the film &#8216;Jesus&#8217; in the town of Paro. The arrest was carried 
out by a Lieutenant Colonel of the Crime and Investigation Department of Royal Bhutan Police 
(RBP) in Thimphu. He punched and hit the two men during the arrest. They were thought to be 
held incommunicado in Thimphu, at the date this communication was sent. Reports also 
indicated that they were subjected to torture and ill-treatment in detention. <b>

communication of 12 July 2006 regarding <b>Mr Dhungana and Mr Tamang</b>. The Government 
noted that the accused had committed misconduct under section 294 of the Penal Code and 
violated article 9 of the National Security Act by identifying themselves as government officials 
and calling for a village meeting, where they promoted the bible and maligned the Spiritual Head 
of Bhutan, His Holiness the Je Khenpo. Additionally both accused had given false information 
committing an offence of deceptive practice under section 309 of the Penal code and had 
distributed medicines to the public breaching sections 265 and 267 of the Penal Code. The

<p>81. On 9 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding 
Ms <b>Conceicao Paganele</b>, president and founder of the Association of Mothers and Friends of 
Children and Adolescents at Risk (AMAR). AMAR is a non- governmental organization that 
defends the rights of adolescents detained in FEBEM units. According to the information, in 
January 2005, Ms Paganele publicly denounced the alleged practice of torture in the UI-41 Unit 
at the Vila Complex of  FEBEM. As a result of her statements, she received death threats by 
telephone. It was reported that Ms Paganele was followed on a number of occasions by 
unknown vehicles. She reported these incidents to the police, and although an investigation was 
opened, the perpetrators had not yet been found.  It was further reported that in November 2005 
Ms Paganele was publicly accused of &#8220;creating problems&#8221; by the then Governor of the State of 
Sao Paulo, and that FEBEM accused her of inciting a rebellion among the detainees after her 
visit to FEBEM&#8217;s Tatuap&#233; Complex on 17 November 2005. On 31 March 2006 officials from 
the UI-19 Unit of FEBEM initiated a legal action against Ms Paganele accusing her of 
slander/libel. On 18 April 2006 the FEBEM Internal Affairs Office initiated a legal action 
against Ms Paganele accusing her of harm, inciting a crime, conspiracy and aiding and abetting 
an escape.

Guapirimim, in Rio de Janeiro state. Monassa was murdered in a central square of the town 
while having an argument with a close relative of the municipal councillor &#8211;who apparently 
intervened in the clash and started violently attacking the journalist. The journalist later died in a 
local hospital.  Monassa was a popular journalist and political activist, well-known for his 
critical stands against the municipal government.

83. On 22 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning the 
newspaper &quot;<b><i>Bom Dia.</i></b> &quot;. On the evening of 4 August 2006, Judge Paulo S&#233;rgio Romero Vicente 
Rodrigues, of the Fourth Civil Tribunal of the city of S&#227;o Jos&#233; do Rio Preto, (State of Sao Paolo) 
forbade the newspaper &quot;Bom Dia&quot; to report on a case of international medicine trafficking in the 
city, basing his decision on the confidentiality of the ongoing legal investigation of the case. The 
judge's ruling was allegedly in response to a request presented, on that same afternoon, by the 
State Prosecutor Mauro C&#233;sar Filet, after the newspaper revealed that his son had been detained 
in the United States, due to his possible links with the crime. The judge ordered the newspaper 
and its editor-in-chief to abstain from publishing any information alluding to the investigation of 
the case as long as Mauro Filet&#8217;s son was considered a suspect. 
 
84. On 23 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning <b>Maria 
Mazzei,</b> reporter of the <i>O Dia</i> Newspaper. According to the information received, since 15 
August 2006, Ms Mazzei and her family had been subject to death threats, due to the publication 
of a series of articles on trafficking with human bodies. In the said articles, Ms Mezzei had 
reported about the alleged involvement of staff of the Medical Forensic Institute and public 
officials in the selling of human bodies to the so-called &#8220;Mafia dos Corpos.&#8221;  
 
85. On 10 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning 
newspaper <b><i>Di&#225;rio de Marilia</i></b> . According to the information, on 1 October 2006, demonstrators 
attacked the building of <i>Di&#225;rio de Marilia</i>, in Marilia city, S&#227;o Paulo state, breaking the entrance 
door, threatening journalists and trying to confiscate all copies of the newspaper. Reportedly, the 
mob was composed by supporters of the former mayor Abelardo Camarinha who was a candidate 
to the Federal Parliament in the first round of general elections on 1 October 2006. The attack 
was apparently linked to some articles published by <i>Di&#225;rio de Marilia</i> concerning a sentence by 
an electoral court against Abelardo Camarinha and his son Vin&#237;cius for producing advance 
electoral propaganda, and a suit initiated by the regional prosecutor's office for abuse of power 
and illegal use of public equipment, which would have barred Abelardo Camarinha from seeking 
public office for several years. It was reported that, later on the same day, a local judge granted a 
suspension order against the paper and the closure of its website, while the police had to 
intervene in order to end the siege of the demonstrators around the newspaper&#8217;s building. 
 
86. On 21 November 2006, the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression sent a letter of 
allegation to the Government of Brasil concerning <b>Fausto Brites</b>, the editor of <i>Correio do 
Estado</i> newspaper. According to the information received, on 31 of October 2006, <b>Mr</b> Brites 
was sentenced to 10 months' imprisonment and fined with approximately US$ 875 for 
defamation. The lawsuit had been filed by the former Mayor of Campo Grande and governor of 
Mato Grosso do sul State, over a report on money-laundering published by the newspaper in 
March 2005. The newspaper had reportedly linked the case to an accusation it had published in 
1999 about alleged corruption in garbage -collecting companies, in which the former mayor was 
said to be involved. On a separate incident, on 20 October 2006, the signal of television station 
<b><i>TV Convencao in Sao Paulo</i></b>  state was cut by the municipal police. According to the director of 
the said station, the Mayor of the town of Itu was behind the cut in an attempt to silence the TV 
station, which was said to be critical of his government. Reportedly, <i>TV Convencao station</i> had 
stopped broadcasting for 21 days in February 2006 until a judge issued an injunction ordering 
the restoration of the signal. In September 2005, the same Mayor had reportedly submitted a 
complaint to the National Telecommunications Agency (ANATEL) about the illegality of the </p>

television station. It has been reported that ANATEL inspected the station&#8217;s facilities in May and 
August 2006 and found no irregularities.

</b>94. On 6 January 2006, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning 
<b>Mr</b> <b>Kem Sokha</b>, President of the <i>Cambodian Centre for Human Rights (CCHR)</i>; <b>Mr Pa Nguon </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 39 
 
<b>Teang </b>and Mr <b>Yeng Virak</b>, Director of the <i>Community Legal Education Centre (CLEC)</i> and 
member of the organizing committee of the International Human Rights Day celebration. 
According to the information, Kem Sokha and Yeng Virak were arrested on 31 December 2005 
and Par Nguon Teang on 4 January 2006 on charges of defamation in relation to celebrations to 
mark the International Human Rights Day on 10 December 2005. The event held was organized 
with authorization from the Ministry of Interior and was agreed upon by the Phnom Penh 
Municipal authorities. On 31 November 2005, a group of police officers and staff of the Ministry 
of Interior surrounded the CCHR office, where Mr Sokha was holding a meeting with CCHR 
staff. The police officers presented a search warrant and a warrant summoning Mr Sokha based 
on defamation complaints against him. When dozens of journalists and CCHR supporters began 
to arrive at the centre, the police locked the gates of the compound, and as a result, the British 
and United States of America Ambassadors, as well as representatives from local and 
international NGOs, were not allowed to enter the compound. CCHR's &quot;Voice of Democracy&quot; 
was allegedly shut down temporarily to prohibit it from broadcasting live coverage of the event. 
Later on the same day, Mr Sokha was arrested and taken to Phnom Penh Municipal Court where 
he was questioned for hours. Police prevented reporters and supporters from entering the court 
building. The defamation case was based on alleged handwritten comments on the banner 
criticising the policy of Prime Minister Mr Hun Sen, about which the police presented to him 
photographs. Mr Sokha was subsequently taken to the Prey Sor prison. Moreover, on the same 
day, police took <b>Mr Yeng Virak</b> to the Municipal Court, where he was questioned and 
subsequently charged with defamation in relation to the celebration of International Human 
Rights Day. One of Mr Yeng Virak&#8217;s lawyers confirmed that he was questioned by Investigating 
Judge Sao Meach and subsequently charged with defamation in relation to the celebration of 
International Human Rights Day in Phnom Penh on10 December. He is now in pre-trial 
detention in Prey Sar Prison. Moreover, on 4 January 2006, <b>Mr Pa Nguon Teang</b> was arrested. 
On 5 January 2006 he was taken to the Municipal Court in Phnom Penh, where he was also 
charged with defamation and was transferred to Prey Sar Prison. According to the information 
received, they were charged by the court with violation of article 63 of the Provisions Relating to 
the Judiciary and Criminal Law and Procedure Applicable in Cambodia during the Transitional 
Period (known as UNTAC Law), which is punishable by eight days to a one -year imprisonment 
and/or a fine of one million (about  &#8364; 210) to ten millions riels. The charges against Kem Sokha 
and Yeng Virak originate from a complaint of defamation filed with the municipal court of 
Phnom Penh on 21 December 2005 by a lawyer representing the Council of Ministers.These 
arrests were in a series of at least nine criminal defamation suits filed over the past year against 
representatives of non-governmental organizations, media, trade unions and the opposition Sam 
Rainsy Party. Mounting concern was expressed that these arrests and the increasing use of 
criminal defamation charges were having a chilling effect on Cambodia&#8217;s civil society and 
constitute a serious threat to freedom of expression. 
 
95. On 28 February 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegation 
concerning <b>Kem Sokha</b>, President of the Cambodian Centre for Human Rights (CCHR); Mr <b>Pa 
Nguon Teang</b>, CCHR Deputy President and Producer of the <i>CCHR Voice of Democracy</i> radio 
programme; Mr <b>Yeng Virak</b>, Director of the Community Legal Education Centre (CLEC); Mr 
<b>Rohng Chhun</b>, President of the Cambodian Independent Teachers&#8217; Association; Mr <b>Chea Mony</b>, 
President of the Free Trade Union of Worker of the Kingdom of Cambodia (FTUWKC) and Mr 
<b>Mam Sonando</b>, Director of <i>Beehive Radio</i>, who had already been the subject of  two previous </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 40 
 
communications. According to information received, on 3 February, government lawyers 
officially withdrew criminal defamation complaints against the aforementioned individuals. 
Nevertheless, under the UNTAC Penal Code adopted in 1992, the withdrawal of a criminal 
defamation complaint does not mean that the charges are dropped. The Prime Minister had 
claimed that the criminal charges would remain as he must not interfere in the work of the courts. 
It was reported that the Prime Minister had declared that defamation should no longer be 
criminalized in Cambodia. However, the judges assigned to these cases had allegedly confirmed 
that criminal charges would not be dropped and that the investigations would be left dormant 
until the statute of limitation of the alleged crimes expire. The Special Rapporteur and the Special 
Representative welcomed the withdrawal of the defamation charges. However, concern was 
expressed that the criminal charges are left open for the aforementioned individuals.  
 
96. On 26 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning 
the situation of Mr <b>You Saravuth,</b> editor of the <i>Sralanh Khmer </i>newspaper. According to the 
information received, on 15 and 17 June, the <i>Sralanh Khmer</i> published articles implicating that a 
newphew of the Prime Minister Hun Sen was involved in a case of land grabbing in Mondulkiri 
province. Following the publication of these articles on 19 June, Mr Saravuth was reportedly 
requested to meet the Prime Minister&#8217;s nephew, and subsequently, the meeting took place. 
During the meeting, staff of the newspaper were allegedly threatened and intimidated. The Prime 
Minister&#8217;s nephew warned them that he would be able to trace Mr Saravuth's phone anywhere 
and track him down. On 21 June, a copy of Mr Saravuth's identity card with his face crossed out 
with pictures of skulls and bones was faxed to the newspaper&#8217;s headquarters. Grave fears were 
expressed for Mr Saravuth's life. He had gone into hiding. 
 
97. On 13 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning Ms <b>Lach Sambo</b>, 
president of the Free Trade Union of the Workers of the Kingdom of Cambodia (FTUWKC) in 
Jenchou Inn Factory in Kandal Province; Ms <b>Gneom Khun</b>, general treasurer of FTUWKC; and 
Mr <b>Sal Koemsan</b>, member of FTUWKC. FTUWKC is a trade union that works in defence of the 
workers. According to the information received, on 3 July 2006, Ms Sambo, Ms Khun and Mr 
Koemsan were arrested on charges of &#8220;illegally confining&#8221; other staff members of the Jenchou 
Inn factory, and were being detained in Prey Sar prison, at the date this communication was sent. 
It was reported that these charges were related to a strike organized on 23 June 2006 at the 
factory to demand better pay and conditions for workers. At the time the events occurred, Ms 
Sambo, Ms Khun and Mr Koemsan were at their homes and were not in the factory.  
 
98. On 21 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture, sent a letter of allegation regarding <b>more than 200 villagers from And 
Snuol district in Kandal Province. </b>According to the information received, on 7 August 2006, 
around 100 riot police officers blocked the entry into Phnom Penh of these villagers, who were 
attempting to travel to the National Assembly and to the provincial court of Kandal to demand the 
release of one of their fellow villagers arrested in relation to a land dispute. Reportedly, when the 
villagers got off the bus, police repelled them by shooting in the air, firing tear gas and beating 
them with batons and rifle buts. Reports indicated that 40 villagers and eight policemen got 
injured during the incident.   </p>

99. On 20 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning <b>Mr Dum 
Sith </b>convicted under the charge of disinformation by the Phnom Penh municipal court. Mr Sith 
was fined 2000 USD and was ordered to pay damages amounting to 2500 USD to the 
government. Reportedly, the lawyer of Mr Sith opposed the court's decision in accordance with 
article 7 of the Law on the Organization and Activities of the Adjudicative Courts of the State of 
Cambodia. On 13 June 2006, the Cambodian government brought a case to court against Mr Sith, 
following the publication of his article in the newspaper <i>Moneaksekar Khmer</i>, where he referred 
to the Deputy Prime Minister Sok An's alleged involvement in corruption. The article in question 
was entitled &#8220;Sok An trading accusations of corruption with party leaders.&quot;  
 
100. On 1 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representtive of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning 
members of the <i>Bright Sky Garment Factory</i> in Phnom Penh section of the Free Trade Union of 
the Workers of the Kingdom of Cambodia (FTUWKC), namely, <b>Mr Chi Samon</b>, the President 
of the Bright Sky Factory section of FTUWKC, <b>Mr Tuy Vang, Mr Morm Thol, Ms In Chai 
Teang, Mr Top Savy, Mr Eam Samrit, Mr Leav Sothearath, Mr Pin Samoeurn, Ms Then 
Thach, Mr Hean Vanrath and Ms Nget Bora</b>. Allegedly a week long peaceful strike organized 
by the members of the said trade union, calling for better working conditions at the Bright Sky 
Factory in Phnom Penh, was violently suppressed on 16 October 2006. Sources allege that 
members of the police used guns, electric batons and rifle butts to suppress the peaceful

Three were reported to have been arrested and detained without charge for a number of days. On 
24 October 2006, the owner of the Factory concerned reportedly closed down the night shift, 
dismissing the night shift. In accordance to the information received, he announced publicly to 
have sent the names of the organisers of the strike to the Garment Manufacturers Association of 
Cambodia, to the Ministry of Commerce and to the Ministry of Labour.

103. Le 15 novembre 2006, le Gouvernement a adress&#233; une r&#233;ponse relative &#224; un appel urgent

g&#233;n&#233;ral sur la situation des d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l'homme, sur <b>Adama Mal-Sali</b>. Le 
Gouvernement informe sur les faits que par exploit de Ahmadou Oumarou Alhadji, Huissier de justice 
&#224; Maroua (province de l'Extr&#234;me-Nord du Cameroun), Amadou Adoum Haman, Lawane 
(responsable traditionnel) du village Balaza Lawone (une bourgade de Maroua), a fait citer devant le 
tribunal de premi&#232;re instance de Maroua Adama Mal-Sali, d&#233;fenseur des droits de l'homme pour des 
faits de diffamation, d'injures, de menaces<b> </b>et de d&#233;nonciation calomnieuse.  II ressort de cet exploit 
qu&#8217;Adama Mal-Sali a adress&#233; une lettre aux autorit&#233;s administratives de la province de l&#8217;Extr&#234;me- Nord 
et aux &#233;lites de Balaza pour porter &#224; leur connaissance qu&#8217;Amadou Adoum Haman est membre d'un 
parti d&#8217;opposition et par cons&#233;quent, milite pour l'&#233;chec du parti au pouvoir dans sa localit&#233;.  Par ailleurs, 
cette autorit&#233; traditionnelle ajoute qu'elle fait injustement l'objet d'invectives et de menaces de la part 
d&#8217;Adama Mal-Sali. La proc&#233;dure judiciaire initi&#233;e contre le susnomm&#233; l'a donc &#233;t&#233; par un particulier 
et non par le parquet ou le chef du parquet d'instance de Maroua<i>.</i>Sur l&#8217;existence d&#8217;une plainte de la 
victime contre Adama Mal-Sali :  il ressort des faits qui pr&#233;c&#233;dent que la victime, Amadou Adoum 
Haman, a saisi directement le Tribunal de premi&#232;re instance de Maroua en vertu des dispositions de l'article 
182 du Code d'instruction criminelle aux termes desquelles; &#171; le tribunal sera saisi, en mati&#232;re 
correctionnelle, de la connaissance des d&#233;lits de<b> </b>sa comp&#233;tence, soit par le renvoi qui lui en sera fait 
d'apr&#232;s les articles 130 et 160, soit par la citation donn&#233;e directement au pr&#233;venu.  Il ressort des faits qui 
pr&#233;c&#233;dent que la victime, Amadou Adoum Haman, a saisi directement le Tribunal de premi&#232;re instance 
de Maroua en vertu des dispositions de l'article 182 du Code d'instruction criminelle aux termes desquelles : 
&#171; le tribunal sera saisi, en mati&#232;re correctionnelle, de la connaissance des d&#233;lits de<b> </b>sa comp&#233;tence, soit 
par le renvoi qui lui en sera fait d'apr&#232;s les articles 130 et 160, soit par la citation donn&#233;e directement au 
pr&#233;venu et aux personnes civilement responsables du d&#233;lit par la partie civile &#187;. Sur la base l&#233;gale des 
poursuites &#224; l'encontre d&#8217;Adama Mal-Sali et  de sa convocation chez le procureur de la R&#233;publique, le 
Gouvernement informe que les poursuites exerc&#233;es contre Adama Mal-Sali l 'ont  &#233;t&#233; sur la base des 
art icles 304 et 305 du code p&#233;nal qui r&#233;priment respectivement la d&#233;nonciation calomnieuse et la 
diffamation ainsi que de l'article 182 du code d'instruction criminelle sus cit&#233;. Elles ont abouti &#224; sa 
condamnation. En effet, il convient de souligner qu' &#224; l'audience du 4 mai 2005, cette affaire a connu des 
renvois utiles et &#224; l&#8217;audience du 3 mai 2006, le Tribunal a d&#233;clar&#233; Adama Mal-Sali non coupable de 
menaces et d'injures, le d&#233;clarant par contre coupable de d&#233;nonciation calomnieuse et le condamnant &#224; 
six mois d'emprisonnement fermes et &#224; 50 000 FCFA d'amende en sa qualit&#233; de d&#233;linquant 
primaire. En outre, il a &#233;t&#233; condamn&#233; &#224; payer &#224; la partie civile 1 franc symbolique &#224; titre de dommages et 
d'int&#233;r&#234;ts.  Le 4 tuai 2006, Adama Mal-Sali a relev&#233; l'appel de la d&#233;cision et le 7 juin 2006, la Chambre de 
la Cour d'appel lui a accord&#233; la libert&#233; provisoire, en attendant le r&#233;&#171;amen au fond de cette affaire par la Cour 
d'appel.  Ainsi, contrairement aux affirmations contenues dans la correspondance sus &#233;voqu&#233;e, 
Adama Mal Sali ne fait nullement l&#8217;objet de harc&#232;lement judiciaire.  Par ailleurs, il y a lieu de 
pr&#233;ciser que le parquet n'a initi&#233; ni pos&#233; aucun acte de poursuite contre Adama Mal-Sali. II n'a en outre 
aucun int&#233;r&#234;t &#224; lui adresser des convocations d&#232;s lors que des poursuites sont directement exerc&#233;es contre lui 
devant un tribunal. Sur la compatibilit&#233; des poursuites et de la convocation de Adama Mal-Sali avec 
les normes contenues dans la D&#233;claration relative aux d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l&#8217;homme, le 
Gouvernement informe qu&#8217;il ressort de l'acte de saisie du tribunal que ce n'est pas pour avoir mis son 
expertise juridique et/ou professionnelle au service d'un tiers qu&#8217;Adama Mal-Sali a &#233;t&#233; cit&#233; &#224; compara&#238;tre 
devant le tribunal. Il a &#233;t&#233; traduit en justice par un particulier qui s'est estim&#233; l&#233;s&#233; dans ses droits. Au </p>

<p>118. On 31 January 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning 
<b><i>Freezing Point (Bingdian)</i></b>  a weekly supplement of the <i>China Youth Daily</i>, which is the official 
newspaper of the Communist Youth League. According to information received, on 24 January 
2006, the publication of <i>Freezing Point (Bingdian)</i> was suspended by the Central Propaganda 
Department of the Chinese Communist Party. The editorial staff of <i>Freezing Point</i>, in particular 
Editor <b>Li Datong</b>, was insistently criticized by the Central Propaganda Department and other 
Party&#8217;s members for their editorial choices. Reportedly, they were accused of &quot;viciously 
attacking the socialist system&quot; after the publication of an article against the Party&#8217;s initiative to 
introduce an additional benefit system, rewarding journalists and reporters, linked to the 
appreciation of their work by cadres and government officials. 
 
119. On 1 February 2006, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>Mr</b> <b>Yang Tongyan,</b> 
an internet writer known by his pen name Yang Tianshui. According to information received, on 
20 January 2006, <b>Mr</b> Yang was formally arrested in the prison of Zhenjiang, after having spent 
almost a month in preventive detention, on suspicion of inciting subversion of state authority.  
Since he was taken into custody on 23 December 2005, authorities allegedly denied him access 
to a lawyer or contact with his family on the ground that his case involved State secrets. 
Reportedly, <b>Mr</b> Yang had spent 10 years in prison on counterrevolution charges for condemning 
the Government's response to demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in 1989.  He was further 
detained for a month between December 2004 and January 2005 on suspicion of inciting 
subversion of state authority.  
 
120. On 9 February 2006, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegation 
concerning <b>Ms</b> <b>Ma Yalian</b>, a housing rights activist and cyber dissident. Ms Ma had already 
been the subject of an urgent appeal sent on 5 January 2006. According to information received, 
on 14 January 2006, Ms Ma was arrested by police and taken to the Residents&#8217; Committee office 
of Haungpu district, Shanghai. It was reported that when in the police car, Ms Ma&#8217;s hands were 
cuffed behind her back and her head was covered. She was taken from the Residents&#8217; Committee 
office to a hotel. At the hotel, her hands and legs were tied for 24 hours. She was then transferred 
to another hotel, where her room was guarded by several police officers. It was alleged that she 
was deprived of medical care during her detention, despite the fact that she suffers from a liver 
condition and also has to use crutches in order to walk, and that the authorities refused to inform 
her parents of her whereabouts or the reason for her arrest and detention. No legal document was 
presented to Ms Ma to justify her detention, and that she was released on 2 February 2006. Ms 
Ma was previously arrested and detained between 22 and 28 December 2005. She had also been 
sentenced to serve Re-Education through Labout Management camp in August 2001 and March 
2004. On 9 of February 2006 the Government of China replied to the communication of 10 
January 2005. 
 
121. On 2 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>Mr</b> <b>Li 
Yuanlong,</b> an internet writer known by his pen name as Ye Lang. According to the information 
received, <b>Mr</b> Li was detained on 29 September 2005 and was charged on 9 February 2006 for 
inciting subversion of the state authority. He was subsequently prosecuted, reportedly based on a </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 48 
 
few articles he had written for foreign based websites about harsh living conditions in Guizhou 
Province, which were critical of government policies in this regard. Concern was expressed that 
his prosecution might be directly linked to his criticisms of the Chinese government policies, 
particularly in light of the reported pattern of prosecutions and subsequent imprisonments of 
cyber dissidents in this respect. 
 
122. On 6 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>Ren Zhiyuan</b>, a 
cyber dissident and schoolteacher . According to the information, on 10 May 2005, Ren Zhiyuan 
was arrested and detained in Nantong, Jiangsu Province. His arrest and detention were based on 
an essay that he posted on the internet, &quot;The Road to Democracy&quot;, where he expressed his view 
that people have the right to overthrow tyranny by violent means. On 30 September, he was tried 
for subversion. On 17 March 2006, the verdict and sentence against him were made public: Ren 
Zhiyuan was sentenced to 10 years&#8217; imprisonment for &quot;subversion of state power&quot;. His defence 
lawyer expressed his intention to appeal.  
 
123. On 18 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, 
sent an urgent appeal concerning <b>several petitioners </b>in Shanghai. According to the information 
received, on 13 February 2006, more than a dozen petitioners had a meeting with an American 
consular official at the house of petitioner Ms Fu Yuxia. Following the meeting, several 
petitioners were arrested and detained in connection with the meeting. Amongst them were <b>Mr</b> 
<b>Chen Xiaoming</b>, Ms <b>Fu Yuxia</b>, and <b>Mr</b> <b>Han Zhongming</b>. Chen Xiaoming was arrested on 15 
February by police officers from Shanghai&#8217;s Luwan District Public Security Bureau (PSB) and 
was held in a room at the PSB station.  He was suspected of taking the American consular 
official to the meeting. On 6 March, he was stripped naked and physically abused. Reports 
further indicated that Chen Xiaoming&#8217;s whereabouts had been unknown since 31 March. Fu 
Yuxia was also arrested on 15 February. She was released on 5 April, and since then had been 
kept under house arrest. Han Zhongming and his wife were subjected to surveillance following 
their participation in the meeting. On 16 February, Han Zhongming was detained. His wife has 
reported his disappearance to the police, but no action had been taken by the police. His 
whereabouts remained unknown at the date this communication was sent. On the same day, in a 
separate incident, Ms <b>Ma Yalian</b>, a housing rights petitioner who was the subject of three 
previously transmitted communications, was arrested. She was held at Fengqi Hotel in Pudong 
New District under the watch of a dozen police officers. She was released on 6 May, but 
remained under house arrest, at the date this communication was sent.   
 
124. On 19 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding 
<b>Mr</b> <b>Yang Tianshui</b>, a cyber-dissident. He had already been the subject of a previously sent 
communication, to which the Government had replied. According to new information received, 
on 16 May 2006, Yang Tianshui was sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment for posting critical 
articles about the government on line. He had posted numerous articles on different websites, 
such as the Chinese version of the daily <i>Epoch Times</i>, and had reported on the use of torture 
against human rights activists, and alleged that the Chinese authorities gave protection to some 
criminals. Reports indicated that his trial lasted a few hours. It was further reported that his 
website had been closed by the authorities the previous week. The closure of the website was </p>

reportedly linked to the questionnaire on the site, asking viewers to give their opinion on the 
issue of compensation for families of those killed at the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident.  
 
125. On 19 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegation 
concerning <b>Mr</b> <b>Fu Xiancai</b>, an advocate for the rights of people who have been adversely 
affected by the construction of the Three Gorges Dam in China. According to the information 
received, on 19 May 2006 <b>Mr</b> Fu Xiancai appeared on German state television in an interview 
where he publicly denounced corruption on the part of the Chinese authorities in relation to the 
construction of the Three Gorges Dam. On 8 June 2006, <b>Mr</b> Fu was summoned to meet with 
Public Security Bureau officials at a police station in Hubei province. It was reported that shortly 
after he left the police station <b>Mr</b> Fu was attacked and beaten by unknown individuals. It was 
further reported that as a result of this attack <b>Mr</b> Fu&#8217;s neck was broken and he remained in 
hospital, paralyzed, at the date this communication was sent.  
 
126. On 22 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>Zhao Yan</b>, a news assistant 
at the Beijing bureau of the <i>New York Times</i> and former reporter for <i>China Reform</i> magazine. 
Zhao Yan was the subject of a previously sent communication, to which the Government had 
replied. According to the new information, he was tried behind closed doors at Beijing People's 
Intermediate Court No.2 on 16 June 2006. It was reported that the trial lasted only for a few 
hours without witnesses being questioned and only a few documents being read. Zhao Yan&#8217;s 
sister and foreign journalists were not allowed to attend the trial. The court had not given its 
verdict at the date this communication was sent. He was facing charges of involvement in 
illegally providing State secrets abroad. The charges were reportedly linked with the publication 
of an article in the <i>New York Times</i> on 7 September 2004 revealing Jiang Zemin's plan to retire 
from the position of Chairman of the Central Military Commission and the transfer of leadership 
to President Hu Jintao. This article preceded the official announcement about Jiang's retirement. 
 
127. On 28 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on 
adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, sent an urgent 
appeal regarding <b>Mr</b> <b>Liu Zhengyou</b>, a human rights defender and lands right activist who 
defends the rights of farmers who have been allegedly forcibly evicted from their land and 
houses in Zigong, Sichuan province. According to information received, on 16 June 2006 <b>Mr</b> 
Liu Zhengyou was arrested by police officers while he was on his way to Geneva, Switzerland in 
order to participate in a human rights training workshop organized by a non governmental 
organization. The police officers did not present an arrest warrant. They informed <b>Mr</b> Liu 
Zhengyou that Zigong Municipal Public Security Bureau (PSB) and Sichuan Provincial PSB had 
requested that the police prevent him from going to Geneva to attend the above mentioned event. 
<b>Mr</b> Liu Zhengyou was sent back to Zigong, where he was detained and questioned by police 
officers as a &#8220;criminal suspect&#8221; in relation to his participation in a demonstration against forced 
evictions in April 2005. <b>Mr</b> Liu Zhengyou was reportedly released on 18 June 2006 but was told 
that he would have to return for more questioning at a later date. Furthermore, in the spring of 
2005, <b>Mr</b> Liu Zhengyou applied for a permit for the local farmers to hold a peaceful 
demonstration against forced evictions but the request was denied. On 20 April 2005, when <b>Mr</b> 
Liu Zhengyou tried to submit a petition outlining local farmers' grievances, several villagers </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 50 
 
were beaten and detained by the authorities for &quot;disorderly conduct&quot; and &quot;obstruction of traffic.&quot; 
It was alleged that <b>Mr</b> Liu Zhengyou had been detained and beaten by the police several times 
over the past decade for his activism. 
 
128. On 14 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning <b>Mr</b> <b>Li 
Yuanlong</b>, <i>Bijie Ribao</i>, a newspaper reporter. He had already been the subject of a previous 
urgent appeal sent on 2 March 2006. According to information received, on 13 July 2006, Li 
Yuanlong was sentenced to two years&#8217; imprisonment by the Bijie Intermediate People's Court in 
Guizhou province, for articles he wrote for foreign Web sites, in which he allegedly incited 
subversion of State authority. The reporter, known under the pen name Ye Lang (Night Wolf), 
had been detained since September 2005. His articles had been censored in recent years, because 
they often deal with rural poverty and unemployment in Guizhou Province, creating 
embarrassment to local officials. 
 
129. On 14 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent 
an urgent appeal regarding <b>Mr</b> <b>Chen Guangcheng</b>, a lawyer and human rights defender in 
Linyi, Shandong province; and <b>Mr</b> <b>Guo Qizhen</b>, a volunteer in the Tianwang Disappeared 
Persons Service Center in Cangzhou City, Hebei Province. The Tianwang Disappeared Persons 
Service Center assists relatives of missing persons to publicise their stories on the internet in 
order to find their relatives. <b>Mr</b> Chen had already been the subject three previously sent 
communications. The Government had replied on 12 December 2005 in this regard. According 
to information received, on 12 May 2006, <b>Mr</b> Guo Qizhen was placed under house arrest by 
local security forces, while he was participating in a hunger strike to protest against alleged 
human rights violations committed by the Chinese authorities. On 6 June 2006, <b>Mr</b> Guo was 
charged with &#8220;inciting subversion of state power&#8221; and was being held in the Cangzhou City No. 
2 Detention Center in Cangzhou City, at the date this communication was sent. On 10 June 2006, 
<b>Mr</b> Chen was charged with &#8220;deliberate destruction of property&#8221; and &#8220;organizing a mob to disrupt 
traffic&#8221;, allegedly after he had spent 89 days in incommunicado detention in the Yinan County 
Detention Centre, where he remained. It was reported that he was arrested on 11 March 2006 but 
that his family were not informed of his whereabouts until 11 June 2006. It was still unknown, at 
the time this communication was sent, whether <b>Mr</b> Chen had been finally allowed to see his 
lawyer. 
 
130. On 10 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning Mr 
<b>Dolma Kyab</b>, a teacher of history at a school in Lasha, in the Tibet Autonomous Region. 
According to information received, Mr Kyab was sentenced to ten years&#8217; imprisonment term for 
writing and maintaining a commentary manuscript on various socio-political issues in Tibet, 
including the existence of Chinese military camps in Tibet. It was reported that upon his arrest 
on 9 March 2005, Mr Kyab was first detained by the Public Security Bureau Center. On 
September 2005, the Lhasa People&#180;s Intermediate Court charged him with &#8220;Endangering State 
Security&#8221; and passed the mentioned verdict of imprisonment. Since March 2006, he had been 
serving his sentence in Chushul prison, in the capital Lhasa.  
 
131. On 10 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>Zhao Yan</b>, a news assistant </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 51 
 
at the Beijing bureau of the <i>New York Times</i> and former reporter for <i>China Reform</i> magazine. 
The situation of Zhao Yan had already been the subject of two previously sent urgent appeals. 
The Government&#8217;s response dated 14 July 2006 was also acknowledged. According to 
information received, Mr Yan was arrested in Shangai on 17 September 2004. He was charged 
on 21 September 2004 with &quot;providing state secrets to foreigners&quot;, allegations which could lead 
to charge of treason, a crime punishable by execution. His arrest was reportedly linked with the 
publication of an article in the <i>New York Times</i> on 7 September 2004 revealing Jiang Zemin's 
plan to retire from the position of Chairman of the Central Military Commission and the transfer 
of leadership to President Hu Jintao. This article preceded the official announcement about Jiang 
Zemin's retirement. Mr Zhao Yan was tried behind closed doors at Beijing People's Intermediate 
Court No.2 on 16 June 2006. It was reported that the trial lasted only for a few hours without 
witnesses being questioned and only a few documents being read. Zhao Yan&#8217;s sister and foreign 
journalists were not allowed to attend the trial. No verdict had been announced within the official 
six-week time limit, which expired on 25 July 2006.  
 
132. On 22 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning Mr <b>Ching 
Cheong</b>, a reporter working for the Singapore daily <i>Straits Times</i>. According to the information 
received, on 16 August 2006, Ching Cheong was tried by the Second Intermediate People's 
Court in Beijing on &#8220;espionage charges&#8221;. Family members and colleagues were not allowed to 
attend the trial, which allegedly ended without an immediate verdict. Mr Ching had been 
detained since April 2005 after traveling from Hong Kong to mainland China, where he was 
allegedly trying to obtain a manuscript for its publication. The manuscript was said to contain the 
transcript of a series of interviews with the Chinese Communist Party leader Zhao Zyang, Mr 
Ching, who had been held in house arrest for his criticism of the government, since 1989 till his 
death in January 2005. The journalist, who would have confessed his crimes according to official 
sources, was subsequently charged with spying and plotting in collaboration with the 
government of Taiwan. 
 
133. On 31 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning <b>Zhao Yan</b>, a 
journalist at the Beijing bureau of the <i>New York Times</i>. On 17 September 2004, Zhao Yan was 
charged with &#8220;providing state secrets to foreigners&quot;. The charge was allegedly connected with an 
article published in <i>New York Times</i> on 7 September 2004, revealing Jiang Zemin's retirement 
from the position of chairman of the Central Military Commission. The article preceded the 
official announcement about Jiang's retirement. <i>New York Times</i> said that Mr Yan had no 
involvement whatsoever in the article. On 25 August 2006, charges for &quot;providing state secrets 
to foreigners&quot; had been dropped, though Mr Yan was instead convicted for having committed the 
crime of fraud and subsequently sentenced to three years&#8217; imprisonment.  
 
134. On 19 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appal regarding Mr<b> Guo 
Qizhen, </b>Mr<b> Zhang Jianhong, </b>Mr<b> Chen Shuqing </b>and Mr<b> Yang Maodong</b>. Mr Guo Qizhen had 
already been the subject of a previous communication sent on 14 July 2006. A reply from the 
Government was received on 3 October 2006. According to information received, on 12 
September 2006, Mr Guo Qizhen was tried for the commission of the crime of &quot;inciting 
subversion of state authority&quot;. On 17 October 2006, Guo Qizhen was sentenced to four years&#8217; 
imprisonment by a court in Cangzhou in Hebei province. Reportedly, the imprisonment was 
related to his critical articles published on overseas websites and to his participation in May 2006 
in a rotating hunger strike, which had been taking place since 4 February 2006 to protest against </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 52 
 
human rights violations in China. Mr Zhang Jianhong and Mr Chen Shuqing were both charged 
with &quot;inciting subversion of state authority&quot; on 12 October 2006 and on 17 October 2006 
respectively. Reportedly, their charges were related to their ariticles written in international 
websites. Zhang Jianhong was arrested on 6 September 2006 in Ningbo. He is a poet and writer, 
who regularly wrote for international websites, and who founded and was the editor of a literary 
website until its closure in 2005. Chen Shuqing was arrested on 14 September 2006 in 
Hangzhou. On 28 September, Yang Maodong was charged with &quot;illegal business activities&quot; for 
allegedly publishing and selling books. He was arrested on 14 September 2006 in Guangzhou 
and was reportedly being held by the Public Security Bureau in Guanzhou. 
 
135. On 1 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning <b>the enactment of 
tightening regulations regarding the legal profession, procedural obstacles to its exercise 
and an increase in the harassment of lawyers. </b>It was alleged that the Criminal Code and the 
Criminal Procedure Code had been misused by authorities, in order to undermine lawyer&#8217;s 
defence work, especially in sensitive political or social unrest cases. Article 306 of the Criminal 
Code, article 96 of the Criminal Procedure Law and article 45 of the Law of the People&#8217;s 
Republic of China on Lawyers, would allow prosecutors to arrest lawyers on grounds of perjury 
or false testimony. According to these provisions, lawyers can be accused of destroying or 
fabricating evidence and of forcing or inciting a witness to change a testimony. These acts are 
punishable by imprisonment up to seven years and by the revocation of the lawyer&#8217;s licenses.  It 
was reported that at least 100 lawyers had been accused of violating this article on the fabrication 
of evidence. These incriminations were reportedly used by authorities as a method to silence 
defence lawyers. It was also reported that Article 96 of the Criminal Procedure Law, which 
applies to State secret cases, compels defendants who wish to be provided and meet with a legal 
counsel to request the approval of the investigative organ, which in general is the public security 
authority. Moreover, both the Law on the protection of state secrets and a notice issued by the 
Ministry of Public Security and the National Administration for the Protection of State secrets in 
1995 entitled &#8220;Regulation on State secrets and the scope of each level of classification in public 
security work&#8221; contain a definition of &#8220;State secrets&#8221; which is excessively broad. As a 
consequence, criminal defence lawyers are very much exposed to being accused of disclosing 
State secrets. Moreover, several restrictive regulations on the legal profession had been issued by 
national and local authorities. On 20 March 2006, the All China Lawyers Association (ACLA) 
issued a &#8220;Guiding Opinion on Lawyers handling Collective Cases&#8221;, which allegedly aimed to 
ensure that sensitive cases do not threaten social stability. According to these rules, lawyers 
taking on collective cases (cases involving more than 10 people) and &#8220;major sensitive cases&#8221; are 
required to immediately report and accept the supervision and guidance from judicial 
administrative organs. Collective cases were reportedly linked to land requisitioning, levying of 
taxes, building demolitions, migrants&#8217; enclaves, enterprise transformation, environmental 
pollution and rural laborers. According to the guidelines, only &#8220;politically qualified&#8221; lawyers are 
allowed to deal with these kinds of cases and before accepting them, they need the approval of at 
least three law firm partners. In addition, the guidelines allegedly warn lawyers to not encourage 
their clients to participate, or participate themselves in petitions before Government offices and 
not to contact foreign media. Lawyers who violate the rules face sanctions. Besides, it was 
alleged that more restrictive regulations have been issued by local public authorities. These 
regulations are generally called &#8220;Opinions on strengthening the guidance of lawyers handling </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 53 
 
major and collective cases&#8221; and reportedly limit lawyers' freedom of expression, because they 
are not allowed to talk to the media about their views on collective and sensitive cases. It was 
also reported that several procedural obstacles were preventing lawyers from performing their 
duties, in particular conducting investigations and gathering evidences. Lawyers are compelled, 
inter alia, to request an authorization to the investigative organ to meet their clients in prison and 
they reportedly have a lot of restrictions on photocopying and recording case materials, 
necessary for the defence work. Besides, in order to carry their work, lawyers reportedly often 
need to pay to officials and judges &#8220;file retrieval fees&#8221;, &#8220;services fees&#8221; and fees for referrals from 
judges. Furthermore, it had been reported that the national lawyer&#8217;s association ACLA is not 
independent, since its Secretary- General is also the deputy director of the division in charge of 
lawyers and notary publics in the Ministry of Justice, and its three deputy secretaries worked for 
the Ministry of Justice just before they became ACLA members. Finally, it was alleged that 
lawyers were being harassed and in some cases attacked by authorities, because of their 
professional activities as legal representatives. Lawyers have no system of immunity linked to 
their professional activity. They are assimilated to their clients and like the suspects they defend, 
they are often held in prolonged pre-trial detention and have difficulty meeting with their own 
lawyers. When released, they and their families are subjected to intimidation by the authorities. 
One of the consequences of this situation would be that some defendants had been unable to find 
a lawyer willing to take their case because of its sensitive nature.  In this context, the Special 
Rapporteurs brought to the Government&#8217;s attention some cases of lawyers who had been 
allegedly victims of intimidation and harassment. Mr <b>Yang Maodong</b>, a lawyer in charge of 
human rights cases, also known as Guo Feixiong, who was the subject of previous 
communication, was detained on 2 August 2006 after four days of &#8220;disappearance&#8221; following a 
protest outside the Xinhuamen Gate to the central Government residential compound in Beijing. 
On 9 August 2006, he was reportedly beaten by the train police and then taken to Shaoguan, 
Guangdong Province, where he was detained overnight. On 10 August 2006, he was allegedly 
forcibly sent back home in Guangzhou, after being accused by the police of holding a fake train 
ticket. On 18 August 2006, the police announced that Mr <b>Gao Zhisheng</b>, a well know lawyer in 
charge of human rights cases, had been arrested &#8220;for suspect involvement in criminal activities&#8221;. 
Mr Gao Zhisheng was already the subject of three previous communications. In response to his 
arrest, dozens of persons had signed a petition asking for his release. Several of them had been 
reportedly put under house arrest, as well as his wife and two children. On August 19 2006, the 
trial of <b>Chen Guangcheng</b>, a lawyer in charge of human rights case, reportedly took place 
without the presence of his legal team. On 24 August 2006, he was sentenced to four years and 
three months in prison. Moreover, two other lawyers associated with Mr Chen case, <b>Yan Zaixin</b> 
and <b>Zhang Jiankang</b> had been reportedly harassed and forcibly returned to their home. Chen 
Guangcheng had already been the subject of several communications. On 27 June 2006, <b>Li 
Jinsong</b> resigned to be Chen Guancheng&#8217;s Chief council after being attacked reportedly by 20 
men who overturned his car while he was inside. On August 19 2006, Mr Jinsong and another 
defence lawyer on Chen Guacheng&#8217;s case, <b>Zhang Lihui</b>, were allegedly denied access to Mr 
Cheng trial. They were allegedly detained and charged of theft and then released. In addition, 
they had been reportedly barred from the bar since then. <b>Xu Zhiyong</b>, who replaced Li Jinsong 
in defending Chen Guancheng, was allegedly beaten by unidentified men and taken into police 
custody on the day before Chen&#8217;s trial began. They were released 22 hours later, after Chen&#8217;s 
trial had already finished. Mr <b>Zheng Enchong</b>, a lawyer in charge of human rights cases, served 
three years in prison for &#8220;leaking State secrets abroad&#8221; after he contacted an overseas human 
rights group about illegal evictions in Shangai. Released in June 2006, he had since been under </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 54 
 
virtual house arrest and was allegedly constantly monitored and harassed by the police. Mr 
Zheng Enchong had already been the subject of two urgent appeals. <b>Li Baiguang</b> was detained 
on 14 December 2004, allegedly because of the legal representation provided by him to 100.000 
peasants seeking damages from forced land evictions. It was reported that since his release he 
had been detained and physically attacked several times. <b>Ma Guanjun</b>, who represented a rape 
suspect in 2003, was detained and accused of &#8220;obstructing justice&#8221;. According to the information 
received, during the retrial, the witnesses whom Ma Guanjun prepared in favour of his client said 
that the suspect could not have committed the rape, but after police officers interrogated them 
and once again they decanted their testimony. Afterwards, Ma Guanjun was convicted of 
violating article 306 of the Criminal Code. He served 210 days in prison until a lawyers 
association launched an investigation on his case which lead to his release in March 2004. 
 
136. On 21 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal regarding Mr 
<b>Chen Guangcheng</b>, a human rights lawyer, and his wife <b>Ms Yuan Weijing</b>, his lawyers Mr <b>Li 
Jinsong</b> and Mr <b>Li Fangping</b>, a member of his defence team, Dr <b>Teng Biao</b>, and witnesses to 
his trial, - Mr <b>Chen Gengjiang</b>, Mr <b>Chen Guangdong</b>, Mr <b>Chen Guangyu</b> and Mr <b>Chen 
Guanghe.</b> Mr Chen Guangcheng has been the subject of four previous communications, dated 1 
December 2006, 14 July 2006, 31 October 2005 and on 19 September 2005 and three replies of 
the Government dated 12 December 2005, 14 June 2006 and 3 October 2006 (awaiting 
translation) have been received. The Special Rapporteurs welcome the Government&#8217;s 
observations, but is afraid that they do not alleviate his concerns with respect to this case, 
particularly so in the light of consistent reports that a number of individuals involved in his trial 
have allegedly been targeted by the security forces. On 27 November 2006, Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s 
retrial before the Yinan County People&#8217;s Court lasted approximately 10 hours. It is reported that 
on 1 December 2006, he was sentenced to four years and three months&#8217; imprisonment for 
&#8220;gathering crowds to disrupt traffic&#8221; and &#8220;intentional destruction of property&#8221;. According to 
reports, Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s wife, Yuan Weijing, has been under de facto house arrest from 12 
August 2005 until 25 November 2006.  Since then, she had been continuously followed by local 
security personnel and persons in civilian clothes believed to have been hired by the police. On 
28 November 2006, around midday, she was arrested by members of the Yinan County Public 
Security Bureau and detained for questioning. Their one-year-old child was also taken but was 
sent home later that day. Approximately eight hours later, Yuan Weijing, was dragged out of 
police car and left in a barely conscious state on the side of the road near her village. She was 
taken to the Mengyin County Menglianggu Hospital where she was treated for extreme trauma 
however she was accompanied by up to 20 policemen as an order of &#8220;residential surveillance&#8221; 
had been issued while she was in detention. She is also suspected of committing &#8220;gathering 
crowds to disrupt traffic&#8221; and for &#8220;intentional destruction of property&#8221;. Furthermore it is reported 
that the local authorities have intimidated witnesses and allegedly withheld evidence in order to 
prejudice Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s retrial. It is further reported that four other key witnesses in the 
aforementioned trial have been subject to police harassment in relation to the most recent trial 
and were subjected to torture in order to provide false testimony against Mr Chen Guangcheng in 
his previous trial. According to reports, Mr Chen Gengjiang was detained on 26 November 2006 
and held until after the hearing had taken place. He was allegedly forced to sign papers in which 
he agreed not to participate in the case. On the same day, Mr Chen Guangdong and Mr Chen 
Guangyu reportedly disappeared after they had agreed to testify on behalf of the defence. Later 
the same evening, Mr Chen Guanghe was allegedly abducted by undercover police officers as he 
was on his way to meet with Mr Li Fanping regarding the upcoming trial in which he was </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 55 
 
scheduled to testify the following day. He was reportedly formally arrested on 28 November but 
his family was not informed of his arrest or his whereabouts until 3 December 2006. Previously, 
it is alleged that Mr Chen Guanghe was detained and tortured before the first trial by members of 
the Yinan police in order to procure a false confession and to testify against Mr Chen 
Guangcheng. He was convicted on the basis of the false confession but granted a suspended 
sentence. It is feared that his recent detention may be related to the fact that that he has submitted 
written testimony stating that his prior evidence had been coerced through torture. Members of 
Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s defence team have also allegedly been harassed, including his lawyers Mr 
Li Jinsong, Mr Li Fangping and Dr Teng Biao. The two lawyers were apparently prevented from 
interviewing witnesses and obtaining further evidence for the retrial. On 27 November 2006, as 
the trial was taking place, Dr Teng Biao was reportedly detained for five hours during which he 
was allegedly pushed to the ground by six or seven policemen who held him down while they 
searched him. They also apparently searched his bags and computer and confiscated his mobile 
phone. Previously it had been reported that on 12 August 2005, Mr Chen Guangcheng and his 
wife Yuan were put under de facto house arrest. On 25 August 2005, Chen Guangcheng evaded 
the police surrounding his village and went to Shanghai and Nanjing, then Beijing to seek help 
from lawyers. On 6 September 2005 he was detained at the house of a friend in Bejijing by six 
men who said they were public security bureau (PSB) officers. He was held overnight in a hotel 
and the head of the Linyi PSB and the Deputy Mayor of Linyi came to see him in the morning. 
The Linyi PSB head told Mr Guangcheng he was suspected of violating article 111 of CCC 
(illegally providing intelligence to foreign countries), for which the maximum sentence is life.  
However, no one produced an arrest warrant justifying his detention and the Linyi PSB men 
coercively took Chen Guangcheng back home. Mr Guangcheng was placed under house arrest 
without any order to that effect. On 9 September 2005 his landline and mobile phone services 
were cut off, and his computer was seized. On 23 September 2005, PSB officials searched his 
house without producing a search warrant. On 4 October 2005, Beijing law lecturer Xu Zhiyong 
and lawyers Li Fangping and Li Subin attempted to visit Chen Guangcheng but they were 
stopped on their way to his house. Mr Guangcheng reportedly managed to leave his house and 
spoke with them briefly but was then forcibly returned and beaten by men surrounding his house. 
The lawyers tried to approach Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s house but were physically prevented. Xu 
Zhiyong and Li Fangping were also beaten. The three lawyers were then taken to Shuanghou 
Township Police station where they were interrogated until the following morning. They were 
advised that Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s case involved &#8220;State secrets&#8221; and were escorted back to 
Beijing. On 24 October 2005, two other friends of Chen Guangcheng from Beijing went to visit 
him. As Mr Guangcheng tried to greet them, he was stopped and beaten by around 20 men 
surrounding his house. They beat Chen Guangcheng with fists and sticks, knocked him down 
several times and kicked him. Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s request to seek medical attention was denied 
by the men who beat him and surveil his house. There were a number of eyewitnesses  on the 
scene. The visitors were escorted away.Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s wife, Ms Yuan Weijing, had also 
been prevented from leaving the house. It is also reported that she was beaten when she left the 
house to greet visitors on 27 December 2005.On 30 October 2005, Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s lawyer 
filed a lawsuit on his behalf at the People&#8217;s Court of Yinan County against two Shuanghou 
Township officials with intentional injury for their involvement in beating him outside his house 
on 24 October 2005. The two officials are alleged to head the group of more than 20 men who 
surveill Chen Guangcheng and Yuan Weijing&#8217;s house. It is reported that to date the court has 
ignored Mr Guangcheng&#8217;s suit. With respect to the &#8216;traffic&#8217; incident of which  Chen Guangcheng 
was eventually charged, on 11 March 2006, Chen Guangcheng reportedly marched with other </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 56 
 
villagers to protest the beating of a villager. Several dozen police blocked their way and 
surrounded them on national highway 205, thereby causing a traffic disruption. Chen 
Guangcheng was taken by Yinan County police from his house to the Yinyan Detention Centre 
without an arrest warrant.  There he was held incommunicado for 89 days until 10 June 2006. 
According to reports, Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s lawyers collected written testimonies from village 
witnesses, who were also detained and then released on bail. These villagers were reportedly 
forced to confess or provide incriminating false information against Chen Guangcheng. They 
have stated that police used various torture methods at the detention centre in order to elicit 
confessions, such as tying them up to chairs with chains, depriving them of sleep for up to 15 
days and withholding food and water. On 10 June 2006, Chen Guangcheng was formally 
detained on suspicion for &#8220;gathering crowds to disrupt traffic&#8221; and &#8220;intentional destruction of 
property&#8221;. On 21 June 2006, Yinan PSB issued an arrest warrant for Chen Guangcheng No. 193 
(2006). On the same day, Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s lawyers&#8217;s were allowed to visit him for the first 
time in three months. However, when they asked where he had been detained during those three 
months, the prison guards interrupted their discussion, preventing Mr Guangcheng from 
answering the question.  His family has not been allowed to visit. His wife remained under house 
arrest.On 22 June 2006, one of Mr Guangcheng&#8217;s lawyers, Mr Li Jinsong, was taken into police 
custody for questioning. On 24 June 2006, two lawyers, Li Jinsong and Li Subin tried to visit Ms 
Yuan but were stopped outside their house and beaten by men enforcing the residential detention 
of Ms Yuan Weijing. On 27 June 2006, lawyers Mr Li Jinsong and Mr Li Subin attempted again 
to see Ms Yuan Weijing (to seek medical parole for Chen Guangcheng), but were also harassed 
by persons in the village, while the police refused to intervene.  Around 20 men turned over their 
car (while Mr Li Jonsong was still inside) and smashed their cameras. Li Jonsong was then taken 
to the police station for questioning. He resigned as Chief Counsel for Mr Chen&#8217;s case. On 18 
August 2006, the day before Mr Guangcheng&#8217;s trial, his lawyers were detained by police. Xu 
Zhiyong who replaced Li Jinsong was allegedly beaten and taken into police custody and not 
released until 22 hours later after Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s trial had ended. Similarly, it is alleged that 
Li Jinsong and another lawyer, Mr Zhang Lilhui were detained by police the night before the 
trial then released after the trial without charge. On 24 August 2006, the Yinan County People&#8217;s 
Court convicted Chen Guangcheng under Article 291 of the Chinese Criminal Code (CCC) for 
&#8220;gathering crowds to disrupt traffic&#8221; and &#8220;intentional destruction of property&#8221;. Article 291 CCC 
provides that &#8220;[w]here people are gathered to disturb order at railway stations or bus terminals, 
ferry landings, civil airports, market places, parks, theatres and cinemas, exhibition halls, sports 
grounds or other public places, or to block traffic or disrupt the movement of traffic, or to resist 
or obstruct public security officials from carrying out their duties according to law, if the 
resulting situation is serious, the ringleaders shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of 
not more than five years, criminal detention or surveillance.&#8221; Chen Guangcheng was sentenced 
to four years and three months' imprisonment.  However, the Linyi City Intermediate People&#8217;s 
Court, when reviewing the appeal by Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s lawyers, overturned this verdict on 30 
October 2006 on the basis of insufficient evidence for convicting Chen Guangcheng for the 
offence under Article 291 CCC. Instead of declaring Chen Guangcheng to be innocent and 
releasing him, the Intermediate Court referred the case back to the lower court for re-trial. He 
continued to be held in detention at the Yinan County Detention Centre. Grave concerns are 
expressed that the charges against Chen Guangcheng and his wife Yuan Weijing  are fabricated 
and are solely related to their legitimate activities in defence of human rights, in particular their 
defending villagers&#8217; rights.  Serious concern is expressed that Chen Guangcheng did not receive 
a fair trial as his lawyers were obstructed in all aspects of their work from collecting evidence </p>

from witnesses to meeting with their client. Concern is also expressed by the allegations his 
lawyers were subjected to physical abuse and detention to prevent them from representing their 
client at trial. Similar concerns are now expressed for the fate of his wife, Yuan. Further concern 
is expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of any witnesses for the defence as it is 
feared that they have been subjected to acts of torture or brutality by the Yinin County PSB.  
 
<b>Replies from the Government  
 
</b>137. By letter dated 11 of April 2006, the Government of China responded to the 
communication of 31 January 2006. The Government noted that on 11 November 2006, the 
weekly supplement <b><i>Bingdian (Freezing Point) </i></b> of the China Youth Daily published an article 
entitled &#8220;Modernization and history text-books&#8221;, which, in accordance with the Government, 
repudiated more than 100 years of struggle by the Chinese people against foreign invaders, 
blatantly contradicted historical facts and seriously injured the national sentiments of the Chinese 
people, with extremely adverse effects on society. In view of this situation, the publicity office of 
the Chinese Communist Youth League, the body with oversight responsibility for China Youth 
Daily, decided, with effect from 25 January 2006, to halt publication of Bingdian so that 
corrective measures could be taken, in consistence with the law and the regulations.The 
Government ascertained that the weekly supplement had recommenced publication since 1 
March 2006. At the same time, China Youth Daily changed the management staff concerned in 
the Bingdian editorial office. The Government assured that the Chinese Constitution and Chinese 
law clearly stipulate that citizens enjoy the right to freedom of expression and opinion.  
 
138. On 18 of April 2006, the Government replied to the communication of 1 of February 2006 
concerning <b>Yang Tongyam</b>. The Government stated that since May 2005, Yang had received 
financial assistance from abroad and was suspected of having plotted to subvert the authority of 
the Chinese State. On 23 December 2005, the Jiangsu provincial public security authorities, 
acting in accordance with the law, placed Yang under surveillance in his place of residence. On 
19 January 2006, with the approval of the procuratorial authorities, he was placed under arrest in 
accordance with article 60 of the Criminal Procedures Code. The Government reassured that the 
Chinese judicial authorities complied strictly with the stipulations of the Chinese Criminal Code, 
Criminal Procedure Code and other legal instruments. 
 
139. On 11 of April 2006, the Government of China replied to the communication of 2 of 
March 2006, concerning the case of <b>Li Yuanlong</b>. Until 8 May 2005, Li Yuanlong, signing 
himself &#8220;Ye Lang&#8221; (&#8220;Night Wolf&#8221;) or &#8220;Ye Hao Lang&#8221; (&#8220;Wolf Howling in the Night&#8221;), sent 
articles by email for publication on a large number of overseas websites, which contained 
fabrications, distortions of the truth and exaggerations of the facts, and fomented subversion of 
the authority of the State. On 9 September 2005, Li was taken into criminal custody on suspicion 
of commission of the offence of fomenting subversion of State authority. On 23 September he 
was released on his own recognizance with restricted freedom of movement pending trial and on 
29 September was placed under arrest. On 9 February 2006, the Bijie office of the Guizhou 
people&#8217;s procuratorate laid charges against Li Yuanlong for the offence of fomenting subversion 
of State authority and, initiated proceedings against him with the Bijie regional people&#8217;s 
intermediate court in Guizhou province. At the time of the reception of this letter, this case was 
being heard at first instance. With the approval of the procuratorial authorities, the public 
security authorities took Li into custody, in accordance with article 60 of the Chinese Code of </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 58 
 
Criminal Procedure. The Government noted that Chinese judicial authorities are complying 
strictly with the stipulations of the Chinese Criminal Code, the Chinese Code of Criminal 
Procedure and other legal instruments, and have upheld Li Yuanlong&#8217;s exercise of his lawful 
rights as a person suspected of a criminal offence. 
 
140. On 3 October 2006, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on 10 August 2006 regarding<b> Zhao Yan</b>, a news assistant at the Beijing bureau of 
the New York Times and former reporter for China Reform magazine. The Government of China 
informs that Zhao Yan is an ethnic Han male born on 14 March 1962 and a technical college 
graduate. Prior to his arrest he worked in the Beijing bureau of The New York Times. On 17 
September 2004 he was placed in criminal detention and on 20 October 2004 he was arrested. 
The Beijing No. 2 People&#8217;s Procuratorate charged Zhao Yan with the crime of illegally divulging 
State secrets to a foreign entity and the crime of fraud; a crime case was opened in the Beijing 
No. 2 Intermediate People&#8217;s Court. From a hearing in the Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People&#8217;s 
Court it was found that in the autumn of 2001, after learning that Feng Shanchen, a 43-year- old 
male who had been sentenced to one and a half years&#8217; labour re-education by the labour 
rehabilitation committee in Songyuan, Jilin Province, had not served his term. Zhao Yan secretly 
obtained Feng&#8217;s permission to use his status as a reporter for the Baixing Xinbao newspaper to 
go to Quian Gorlos County in Jilin Province to conduct an investigation. During this time Zhao 
falsely claimed that he coud use his connections in the Legal Affairs Bureau of the State Council 
to get Feng&#8217;s sentence overturned, and he fraudently obtained the sum of 20,000 yuan from Feng 
for that purpose; afterwards, however, he did not give Feng any help with this matter. The 
Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People&#8217;s Court held that Zhao Yan, motivated by illegal gain, 
fabricated a story and fraudently obtained a relatively large sum of another person and that his 
actions constituted the crime of fraud. On 25 August 2006 the Beijing No. 2 Intermediate 
People&#8217;s Court reached a verdict, which was issued in an open session; for the crime of fraud. 
Zhao was sentenced to three years&#8217; imprisonment, fined 2,000 yuan and ordered to continue to 
repay the illegally obtained 20,000 yuan. The Court found that the prosecution had failed to 
produce sufficient evidence to substantiate the charge of illegally divulging State secrets to a 
foreign entity and therefore issued no ruling on that charge. During the trial the court fully 
respected Zhao&#8217;s procedural rights; not only did Zhao Yan exercise his right to a defence, but 
two defence lawyers expressed his views fully. 
 
141. At the time this report was finalized, the replies of the Government regarding the 
communications dated 9 February, 6 April, 18 and 19 of May, 19, 22, and 28 June, 14 July, 22 
and 31 August, and 19 October 2006 were still in the process of being translated. <b> 
</b> 
<b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b> 
142. By letter dated 18 January 2006, the Government of China responded to the jointly urgent 
appeal sent on 29 November 2005 concerning <b>Mr Zhao Xin</b>. The Chinese Government stated 
that it had carefully examined the matters referred to in the aforementioned communication and 
wished to submit the following response: in the morning of 18 November 2005, Mr Xin went to 
the karaoke lounge in the hotel where, together with other members of the tour group and three 
other people, he consumed a large quantity of liquor. When the time came to settle the bar bill, a 
dispute arose with the management, whereupon he was beaten by the bar manager together with 
the waiter, causing him to suffer injuries to his head and fractures of his kneecap and his ribs. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 59 
 
That same day Mr Xin was admitted to the Bayi orthopaedic hospital in Chengdu for treatment. 
Following the incident, the Mao county public security authorities promptly initiated inquiries, in 
accordance with the law, to gather evidence and the accused were taken into custody. At the time 
of receiving the response from the Government Mr Xin was receiving medical treatment at 
Chengdu hospital and legal proceedings were in process. It was further noted by the Government 
that allegations that Mr Xin was beaten because he is a pro-democracy activist and had published 
articles casting aspersions on the human rights situation in China was unfounded. It was noted 
that following the incident, the Chinese judicial authorities and the public security bureau acted 
in strict compliance with the Chinese Criminal Code, the Chinese Code of Criminal Procedure 
and other laws and regulations, and Mr Xin&#8217;s lawful rights have been fully upheld.<b>

suficientes para iniciar una investigaci&#243;n oficial contra los militares ni los agentes

acusaciones de terrorismo y la amenaza de detenci&#243;n en contra de los activistas de la sociedad 
civil, los dirigentes sindicales y los integrantes de las organizaciones de derechos humanos 
puedan estar relacionadas con sus actividades en defensa de los derechos humanos.

Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b> 
167. By letter dated 10 January 2006, the Government of Croatia replied to the communication 
of 14 November 2005 in relation to Mr <b>Predrag Matvejevic</b>. The Government of Croatia 
indicated that no complaint was lodged. Concerning the process of the decriminalization of libel, 
the Government stated that the 2004 amendments to the Criminal Code were applied only in 
several cases, including the case of Predrag Matvejevic; still, they prompted the Government to 
carefully consider further libel law reform. It was further reported that the Government is fully 
aware of the importance of the institute of the freedom of expression and information and thus 
the Croatian Government was considering further amendments to the Criminal Code with the 
aim to prescribe only a fine for offences against honor and reputation of individuals, including 
libel. The same sentences would be envisaged for other 20 or so offences from other chapters of 
the Criminal Code, and in case such a fine was non-collectible, it would be substituted by 
community service and not by prison.

Habana). La detenci&#243;n le habr&#237;a causado un grave empeoramiento de salud agravado por la 
ausencia de medicamentos, a lo que se a&#241;ade como factor de riesgo la avanzada edad del 
detenido, de 62 a&#241;os. Por otro lado, se aleg&#243; que Roberto Jes&#250;s Guerra P&#233;rez, miembro del 
centro de informaci&#243;n de la asociaci&#243;n patri&#243;tica La Corriente Matutina y colaborador de los

la agencia J&#243;venes sin Censura, fue objeto, junto a su familia, de amenazas e intimidaciones 
supuestamente tanto de autoridades locales como por parte de manifestantes que rodearon su 
casa. El mismo d&#237;a 4 de agosto la periodista independiente Alicia Niobis Ortis, perteneciente al 
Partido Liberal Cubano, fue presuntamente detenida por la PNR e interrogada posteriormente por 
agentes de la seguridad del Estado, quienes le aconsejaron no continuar con sus actividades 
period&#237;sticas, advirti&#233;ndole que desde ese momento ser&#237;a vigilada pudiendo llegar a ser 
procesada.  Por otro lado, y seg&#250;n estas mismas fuentes, durante la noche del 3 de agosto de 
2006, la casa en la que reside la Sra. Yamile de los &#193;ngeles Llanes, esposa del periodista preso, 
fue atacada por un grupo de manifestantes que amenazaron con quemar la vivienda. El periodista

los miembros de Cubanac&#225;n Press, una agencia de noticias independiente. El Gobierno de Cuba 
afirma que no existe ni est&#225; registrado legalmente Cubanac&#225;n Press como medio de prensa y que 
el Sr. <b>Guillermo Fari&#241;as</b> no es periodista, o al menos su nombre no corresponde al de persona 
alguna acreditada en Cuba como periodista. Se inform&#243; de que el Sr. Fari&#241;as fue condenado en el 
2002 por provocar alteraciones sistem&#225;ticas del orden p&#250;blico y que desde el 2004 se encuentra 
disfrutando del beneficio de una Licencia Extrapenal por razones de salud, que no son resultado 
de una huelga de hambre sino de una enfermedad cr&#243;nica. Asimismo se se&#241;al&#243; que el Sr. Fari&#241;as 
actuaba como asalariado de los Estados Unidos en apoyo a su pol&#237;tica de hostilidad, bloqueo y 
agresiones contra el pueblo cubano. Referente a las supuestas restricciones del uso de Internet en 
Cuba, la Misi&#243;n Permanente de Cuba ante la Oficina de las Naciones Unidas en Ginebra indica 
que las tecnolog&#237;as de la informaci&#243;n son pilares b&#225;sicos en la pol&#237;tica cubana y que son 
elementos claves para una sociedad basada en el conocimiento. Del mismo modo, se informa de

afirm&#243; que el Sr. Jos&#233; Ubaldo Izquierdo fue sancionado por un delito de actos contra la 
independencia o la integridad territorial del Estado, no por el ejercicio de la libertad de 
expresi&#243;n. Se indic&#243; que se encuentra en prisi&#243;n, despu&#233;s de haberse cumplido todas las 
garant&#237;as del proceso, por haber incurrido en la comisi&#243;n de graves hechos constitutivos de 
delitos, participando en actos en contra del orden constitucional cubano bajo las instrucciones y 
pagado por el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos. El Gobierno de Cuba se&#241;ala que el derecho a la

201. Le 14 mars 2006, le Gouvernement a r&#233;pondu &#224; un appel urgent envoy&#233; par le 
Rapporteur sp&#233;cial et la Repr&#233;sentante sp&#233;ciale du Secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral concernant la situation des 
d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l'homme le 28 d&#233;cembre 2005.  Le gouvernement informe que, en effet, 
suite &#224; un diff&#233;rend qui a oppos&#233; la direction du port au syndicat des travailleurs du port, ces 
derniers ont d&#233;pos&#233; un pr&#233;avis de gr&#232;ve dans la matin&#233;e du 11 septembre 2005.  Le jour 
m&#234;me la direction du port informait le Minist&#232;re de l'Emploi et de la solidarit&#233; nationale </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 78 
 
qu'une gr&#232;ve allait se d&#233;clencher.  Ce dernier a aussit&#244;t entrepris des d&#233;marches aupr&#232;s du 
syndicat afin d'obtenir le report de la gr&#232;ve et demanda &#224; la Direction du Port de donner suite 
au courrier transmis la veille au Directeur du Port et relative aux dol&#233;ances du syndicat.  
Dans la matin&#233;e du 13 septembre 2005, une r&#233;union s'est tenue entre le syndicat du Port et le 
Minist&#232;re de l'Emploi au cours de laquelle les d&#233;l&#233;gu&#233;s syndicaux ont soutenu que plusieurs 
r&#233;unions ainsi que des courriers adress&#233;s &#224; leur direction n'ont aboutit &#224; aucun r&#233;sultat.  Le 
Minist&#232;re de l'Emploi, soucieux de son r&#244;le de m&#233;diation, leur recommanda de reporter la 
gr&#232;ve le temps d'entreprendre les d&#233;marches n&#233;cessaires &#224; la r&#233;solution des revendications 
soulev&#233;es par le syndicat, proposition accept&#233;e par ce dernier. Le m&#234;me jour &#224; 11 heures, une 
autre r&#233;union a eu lieu cette fois-ci entre le Minist&#232;re  de l'Emploi et la Direction du Port &#224; 
l'issue de laquelle la Direction a accept&#233; de n&#233;gocier avec le syndicat.  Malgr&#233; le report de la 
gr&#232;ve accept&#233; par les d&#233;l&#233;gu&#233;s syndicaux, ces derniers ont d&#233;clench&#233; une gr&#232;ve g&#233;n&#233;ralis&#233;e le 
14 septembre 2005 et les membres actifs du syndicat ont emp&#234;ch&#233; &#224; la barri&#232;re principale 
toute entr&#233;e des travailleurs qui avaient d&#233;cid&#233; de ne pas suivre le mouvement de gr&#232;ve, 
paralysant ainsi l'activit&#233; g&#233;n&#233;rale du Port.  Ainsi, lorsque la gr&#232;ve est devenue effective, une 
r&#233;union de crise urgente pr&#233;sid&#233; par le Premier Ministre s'est tenue dans la salle de r&#233;union 
du Terminal &#224; conteneur et un compromis sur deux points a &#233;t&#233; d&#233;gag&#233; : 1) le syndicat a 
avanc&#233; ses diff&#233;rentes dol&#233;ances;  2) la Direction du port a accept&#233; la n&#233;gociation.  Une 
seconde rencontre tripartite a &#233;t&#233; fix&#233;e au 17 septembre 2005 et ce jour l&#224;, la Direction du 
port a sollicit&#233; le renvoi de la n&#233;gociation au 24 septembre 2005 arguant l'absence de son 
Directeur g&#233;n&#233;ral hors du pays.  Le 24 septembre 2005, la rencontre pr&#233;vue n'a pas eu lieu 
faute de pr&#233;sence de toutes les parties concern&#233;es, en l'occurrence la Direction du Port qui le 
jour m&#234;me a tenu une r&#233;union entre les autorit&#233;s du Port et le Pr&#233;sident de l'autorit&#233; du Port 
et de la Zone franche, apr&#232;s une &#233;valuation globale de la situation, a estim&#233; que le syndicat a 
d&#233;clench&#233; la gr&#232;ve sans respecter les proc&#233;dures pr&#233;alables pr&#233;vues par le Code du travail et 
l'article 42 du r&#232;glement int&#233;rieur du Port, en cons&#233;quence d&#233;cida de licencier les &#233;l&#233;ments 
actifs du syndicat.  Ce licenciement affecte onze personnes et &#224; l'annonce du licenciement, 
les membres actifs du syndicat se sont mis &#224; intercepter les bus transportant le personnel en 
contraignant les agents du Port &#224; descendre des bus et de se rassembler sur l'esplanade situ&#233;e 
&#224; la barri&#232;re d'&#201;thiopie d&#233;cr&#233;tant ainsi une gr&#232;ve g&#233;n&#233;ralis&#233;e et paralysant toute l'activit&#233; du 
terminal &#224; conteneur.  En effet, tous ceux qui voulaient se rendre &#224; leur travail ont &#233;t&#233; 
victimes d'une d&#233;sinformation de la part des d&#233;l&#233;gu&#233;s syndicaux et le lendemain 25 
personnes consid&#233;r&#233;es comme agitateurs et d&#251;ment identifi&#233;es ont &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; licenci&#233;s.  
Suite &#224; ces &#233;v&#233;nements, le Port de Djibouti a d&#233;pos&#233; une plainte le 25 septembre 2005 pour 
voie de fait, manifestation illicite et trouble &#224; l'ordre public &#224; l'encontre de <b>Kamil Mohamed 
Ali</b>, <b>Ahmed Ali Aras</b> et <b>Ibrahim Moussa Soultan</b> ainsi que tout individu impliqu&#233; dans cet 
incident.  Douze dirigeants syndicaux ont ainsi &#233;t&#233; traduits en justice.  Par jugement No. 
776105 du 2 octobre 2005, la chambre correctionnelle du tribunal de premi&#232;re instance a 
d&#233;clar&#233; les pr&#233;venus non coupables des d&#233;lits qui leur sont reproch&#233;s et les a relax&#233; des liens 
de la pr&#233;vention.  Le Procureur de la R&#233;publique et le Conseil du Port de Djibouti ont 
interjet&#233; appel de cette d&#233;cision.  Par arr&#234;t No. 01106 du 4 janvier 2006, la chambre 
correctionnelle de la Cour d'appel de Djibouti r&#233;formant le jugement No. 776/05 du 2 octobre 
2005, a requalifi&#233; les faits reproch&#233;s aux pr&#233;venus et a d&#233;clar&#233; Kamil Mohamed Ali, Ibrahim 
Moussa Soultan et Ahmed Ali Aras coupables des d&#233;lits du travail et les a condamn&#233;s &#224; la 
peine de deux mois d'emprisonnement avec sursis chacun.  Les neufs autres pr&#233;venus ont &#233;t&#233; 
reconnus coupables du d&#233;lit de menace et de rassemblement sur la voie publique susceptible 
de troubler l'ordre public et ont &#233;t&#233; condamn&#233;s &#224; la peine d&#8217;un mois d'emprisonnement avec </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 79 
 
sursis chacun.  Suite &#224; ces condamnations, les pr&#233;venus ont form&#233; un pourvoi devant la cour 
supr&#234;me de Djibouti. La base l&#233;gale des poursuites judiciaires &#224; l'encontre des dirigeants 
syndicaux sont donc les dispositions du code p&#233;nal de la R&#233;publique de Djibouti.  Quant aux 
fondements ayant pr&#233;sid&#233; &#224; leur licenciement, le droit de gr&#232;ve est un principe 
constitutionnel certes, mais il s'exerce dans le cadre des lois qui le r&#233;glementent.  Le Code du 
travail des territoires d'outre-mer applicable en l'esp&#232;ce dispose dans son article 218 bis que:  
&#171; Sont interdits tout lock-out et toute gr&#232;ve avant &#233;puisement des proc&#233;dures fix&#233;es par la 
pr&#233;sente r&#233;glementation ou en violation des dispositions d'un accord de conciliation, d'une 
recommandation ou d'une sentence ayant acquis force ex&#233;cutoire &#187;.  L'alin&#233;a 1 de cet article 
poursuit que &#171; le lock-out ou la gr&#232;ve engag&#233; en contravention des dispositions du pr&#233;sent 
code peut entra&#238;ner, pour les travailleurs, la perte du droit &#224; l'indemnit&#233; de pr&#233;avis et aux 
dommages int&#233;r&#234;ts pour rupture de contrat &#187;.  Par cons&#233;quent, la Direction du Port estimant 
que le syndicat n'a pas respect&#233; les proc&#233;dures pr&#233;alables pr&#233;vues par le code de travail et 
l'article 42 du r&#232;glement int&#233;rieur du Port a licenci&#233; pour faute lourde les d&#233;l&#233;gu&#233;s syndicaux 
sur la base de l'article 42 qui stipule que &#171; l'obstacle &#224; la libert&#233; de travail entra&#238;ne le 
licenciement pour faute lourde &#187;. Cependant les d&#233;l&#233;gu&#233;s syndicaux licenci&#233;s disposent des 
voies de recours, ils peuvent saisir le tribunal du travail s'ils estiment que leur licenciement 
est abusif et r&#233;clamer des indemnit&#233;s de rupture et des dommages et int&#233;r&#234;ts.  &#192; ce stade de 
la proc&#233;dure, il parait donc pr&#233;matur&#233; de parler d'une quelconque violation des droits de 
l'homme.

206. El 28 de junio de 2006, el Relator Especial, conjuntamente con la Presidenta-Relatora del 
Grupo de Trabajo sobre la Detenci&#243;n Arbitraria y la Representante Especial del Secretario-
General sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos, envi&#243; un llamamiento 
urgente en relaci&#243;n con <b>Wilman Adolfo Jim&#233;nez Salazar</b>, miembro del Comit&#233; de Derechos

Jim&#233;nez Salazar fue arrestado el 19 de junio de 2006 al mediod&#237;a  mientras se encontraba 
observando el desalojo de las instalaciones de la compa&#241;&#237;a petrolera francesa PERENCO por 
parte de fuerzas militares y policiales. Los alrededores de dichas instalaciones hab&#237;an sido 
ocupados por las Asociaciones Campesinas Payamino y Punino, en protesta por el supuesto 
incumplimiento de las normas constitucionales y legales de protecci&#243;n del medio ambiente por 
parte de dicha empresa petrolera. Durante el desalojo, el Sr. Jim&#233;nez Salazar habr&#237;a sufrido seis 
heridas de bala. Tras su arresto fue conducido al Hospital Civil de Coca y de all&#237; a la estaci&#243;n de 
la Polic&#237;a Judicial de Coca. Ante un recurso de h&#225;beas corpus interpuesto en su favor ante la

207. El 10 de noviembre de 2006, el Relator Especial, conjuntamente con la Representante 
Especial del Secretario General sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos, 
envi&#243; un llamamiento urgente en relaci&#243;n con los supuestos actos de intimidaci&#243;n y agresi&#243;n 
perpetrados en contra de <b>Guadalupe de Heredia</b>, responsable de prensa de la organizaci&#243;n 
Frente de Defensa de la Amazon&#237;a, que integra al equipo de abogados que representan a las 
comunidades ind&#237;genas en contra de la compa&#241;&#237;a petrolera internacional Chevron-Texaco en 
relaci&#243;n con la contaminaci&#243;n causada por la actividad extractiva realizada en sus tierras 
tradicionales en la regi&#243;n de Sucumbios. Un grupo de cinco desconocidos habr&#237;an intentado 
irrumpir en el domicilio de la Sra. de Heredia durante la noche del 23 de octubre de 2006. Sin 
embargo, los desconocidos habr&#237;an desistido de su intento tras o&#237;r los disparos al aire realizados 
por un guarda de seguridad, al que habr&#237;an respondido con una r&#225;faga de disparos. Los hechos 
habr&#237;an sido denunciados por la Sra. De Heredia ante la Procuradur&#237;a de Pichincha. El d&#237;a 
anterior al supuesto intento de intrusi&#243;n en su domicilio, la Sra. de Heredia habr&#237;a participado en 
una conferencia internacional convocada por diversas organizaciones internacionales para 
debatir asuntos relativos a la contaminaci&#243;n medioambiental y la violaci&#243;n de derechos humanos 
producidos en el contexto de actividades extractivas. En el curso de dicha actividad la Sra. de 
Heredia habr&#237;a supuestamente denunciado las actividades de la compa&#241;&#237;a Cehvron-Texaco por </p>

sus efectos en la vida de las comunidades ind&#237;genas. Existe la preocupaci&#243;n de que el supuesto 
intento de intrusi&#243;n en el domicilio de la Sra. de Heredia tuviera car&#225;cter intimidatorio, 
vinculado a sus actividades en defensa de los derechos de los pueblos ind&#237;genas. Se da la 
circunstancia de que la Sra. de Heredia ha sido objeto de medidas cautelares otorgadas por la 
Comisi&#243;n Interamericana de Derechos Humanos el 28 de abril de 2006.  
 
<b>Observaciones

<p>209. On 22 Feburary 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding four judges <b>Ahmed 
Mekki, Mahmoud Mekki, Mahmoud al Khudayri </b>and<b> Hisham Bastaweessee</b>, who are all 
Vice Presidents of the Court of Cassation. According to information received, the High Council 
of the judiciary lifted the immunity of the above-mentioned judges for publicly criticizing 
fraudulent acts, which are alleged to have occurred during the parliamentary elections in 2005, as 
well as for criticizing a proposed bill on the administration of justice. This followed the issuance 
of statements by the Judges Clubs in Cairo and Alexandria, referring to numerous complaints 
they had received from judges, and stating that the complaints should be examined by the 
prosecutor-general. The Judges Clubs also requested the prosecutor-general to look into the 
incidents involving judges during the elections, and to eventually provide compensation for the 
judges involved. At the date, this communication was sent, the four judges were being 
interrogated by the State Security Court which was established under the emergency law. The 
Special Rapporteurs and the Special Representative expressed their concern that the lifting of the 
judicial immunity of the judges and their interrogation by the State Security Court is a violation 
of their right to freedom of expression. 
 
210. On 16 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning <b>Amira 
Malash</b>, a reporter for the weekly <i>Al-Fagr</i>. According to the information received on 7 March 
2006, the Giza Criminal Court sentenced Amira Malash to a one-year imprisonment for 
defaming a judge in an article she wrote in July 2005, in which she alleged that the judge had 
received bribes with regard to a case he was working on. It was reported that the trial lasted 
several minutes. Concern was expressed at the recourse to criminal sanction for a defamation 
charge. 
 
211. On 24 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the situation of human rights, sent an urgent appeal concerning <b>Nagi Dirbala</b>, <b>Ahmad Saber 
</b>and <b>Assem Abdel Gabbar</b>, three Deputy Heads of the Court of Cassation. According to the 
information received: the High Council of the Judiciary lifted the immunity of Mr Nagi Dirbala 
and Mr Ahmad Saber, to enable their interrogation regarding their statements which criticized 
fraudulent acts allegedly occurred during the parliamentary elections in 2005, and their 
comments related to the reform to the administration of justice. Concern was expressed that these </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 82 
 
events might fall into the reported pattern of harassment against members of the judiciary 
expressing critical views against the Government. Concern was heightened by the fact that they 
followed the investigation of Ahmed Mekki, Mahmoud Mekki, Mahmoud al Khudayri and 
Hisham Bastaweessee, all judges and Deputy Heads of the Court of Cassation, for expressing 
their opinions regarding the parliamentary elections in 2005 and the reform to the administration 
of justice.  
 
212. On 5 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent 
an urgent appeal regarding the <b>members of Egypt&#8217;s Judges&#8217; Club</b> and <b>demonstrators </b>who 
gathered to support the assembly of the Judges&#8217; Club, as well as <b>Ahmed Mekki</b>, <b>Mahmoud 
Maki</b>, <b>Hisham Bastawissi</b>, <b>Mahmoud al Khudayri</b>, <b>Nagi Derbala</b>, <b>Ahmad Saber</b> and <b>Assem 
Abdel Gabbar</b>, Deputy Heads of the Court of Cassation. According to the information received: 
the Minister of Justice decided to transfer two Deputy Heads of the Court of Cassation, Judges 
Mahmoud Maki and Hisham Bastawissi, to the Disciplinary Council. It is alleged that this 
decision is an infringement of the independence of the judiciary and a breach of the provisions of 
the Judiciary Authority Law relating to the investigation of judges, and is intended to punish the 
two judges for their allegations of widespread electoral fraud during the parliamentary elections 
of 2005, and for their activism for judicial reform, including their calls for amending the Judicial 
Authority Law to guarantee the impartiality and the financial and administrative independence of 
the judiciary. In particular, it is alleged that currently the Judicial Authority Law provides the 
Minister of Justice with the powers to determine the composition of the Supreme Judicial 
Council, to appoint the Head of the Court of Cassation and to decide the budget. Such control of 
the Supreme Judicial Council allows the Minister to influence that body&#8217;s decisions on the 
appointment, promotion, transfer and discipline of all judges. Also, the Disciplinary Council is 
headed by the Head of the Court of Cassation (appointed by the Minister of Justice) and 
possesses the power to dismiss judges. On 19 April 2006, to protest against this decision, the 
Judges' Club launched an ongoing sit-in in its headquarters in Cairo. On Monday 24 April 2006, 
hundreds of police arrived in front of the Judges Club where a group of peaceful protesters 
gathered in support of the judges' sit-in demanding a stop to the action against Judges Mahmoud 
Maki and Hisham Bastawissi and amendments to the Judicial Authority Law in order to 
guarantee the independence of the judiciary. In an attempt to disperse the protest, police tore 
down banners listing the Judges' Club's demands and verbally and physically attacked some of 
the protesters. In an attempt to capture the events, Judge Mahmoud Abdel Latif Hamza got out 
his mobile phone camera. Upon witnessing this act, several police officers and two State 
Security Intelligence Officers verbally insulted and physically assaulted him and forced him into 
a police vehicle along with fourteen other protesters. It was reported that SSI officers, officers 
from Kasr al Nil station and officers from Shurtat Al-Marafik participated in the attack. All three 
aforementioned forces operate under the Ministry of Interior. In addition, it was alleged that 
these events took place in the presence of high ranking Ministry of Interior officers. Judge 
Mahmoud Abdel Latif Hamza, his brother, and a university professor were released later that day 
upon the intervention of the President of the Judges&#8217; Club. Upon his release, Mahmoud Abdel 
Latif Hamza was taken to the hospital for treatment. According to a medical report from the 
Shahir Hospital of Masr Al-Gedida, he endured several injuries including twisted ligaments in 
his wrist, a bloody nose and a number of scratches and bruises on his face, chin and feet. He still 
remains in hospital. This attack is particularly grave considering that Judge Mahmoud Abdel </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 83 
 
Latif Hamza had undergone open-heart surgery. The twelve remaining people arrested on the 24 
April 2006 were held in custody following an order by the General Prosecutor to detain them for 
15 days pending the results of the interrogations in accordance to article 206 of the Criminal 
Procedures Law. They were charged with making false claims, resisting authorities and 
assembling and blocking public roads. On the next day, the Prosecutor General issued a 
statement accusing the protesters in front of the Judges' Club of attacking the police forces sent 
to remove banners. Concern is expressed that the Prosecutor General issued such a statement 
before the completion of the investigations, against his obligation of impartiality and 
confidentiality. According to the information received, two similar incidents occurred on 26 and 
27 of April 2006, when hundreds of police forces again intervened during the ongoing peaceful 
sit-in at the Judges' Club and the peaceful protests in support of the Judges' Club demands held 
outside its premises. On 26 April, charges were brought against sixteen protesters, and on 27 
April against 12 of them. The accusations included assembly, insulting the President of the 
Republic, purposefully delaying public transportation, slander of public officials, destroying 
public property and possession of publications. It is also reported that the State Security General 
Prosecution issued arrest warrants for thirteen additional participants in the protests in front of 
the Judges' Club charging them with organizing demonstrations and possessing publications 
aimed at disrupting public order. Reports indicate that thus far two of them have been arrested. 
Concern was expressed that these events fall into the reported pattern of harassment against 
members of the judiciary and their supporters expressing critical views against the Government. 
Concern is heightened by the fact that the transfer of Mahmoud Maki and Hisham Bastawissi to 
the Disciplinary Council follows the lifting of the immunity, in order to initiate their 
investigation, of five other Deputies to the Head of the Court of Cassation, Ahmed Mekki, 
Mahmoud al Khudayri, Nagi Derbala, Ahmad Saber and Assem Abdel Gabbar, for expressing 
their opinions regarding the parliamentary elections in 2005 and the reform to the administration 
of justice.  
 
213. On 16 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture, sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>several journalists</b>, who were reporting on 
peaceful protests. According to the information received: on 11 May 2006, several journalists 
were assaulted by police and security officers, while reporting on demonstrations in support of 
two judges who are appearing before a disciplinary committee for calling the parliamentary 
elections fraudulent. <b>Abeer al-Askary</b>, a journalist for the independent weekly <i>Al-Dustour</i>, had 
arranged to interview several lawyers and judges at the Bar Association. When she arrived, 
plainclothes police and security officials grabbed her and took her to an area where security 
vehicles were parked and beat her. She was subsequently taken to Sayeda Zeinab police station. 
Outside the police station plainclothes police officers assaulted her again. It was reported that 
police officers told her to stop writing. She was released later on the same day. It was further 
reported that cameramen from <i>Reuters</i> were assaulted on the same occasion. In separate 
incidents on 11 May, several cameramen covering the protests were taken away from the crowd 
and beaten by plainclothes police officers. Amongst them were <b>Yasir Suleiman</b>, a camera crew 
for the Qatar-based satellite channel <i>Al-Jazeera</i>; and <b>Nasri Yousif</b>, a sound crew for <i>Al-Jazeera</i>. 
Their camera and tape were allegedly confiscated. Furthermore, on 9 May, a state security 
prosecutor extended for 15 days the detention of two journalists: <b>Saher al Gad</b>, a journalist for 
<i>Al-Geel</i> newspaper; and <b>Ibrahim Sahari</b>, a journalist for <i>Al-Alam Al-Youm</i> newspaper, who 
were taken into custody for &quot;disturbing public order&quot; on April 27. They were covering protests 
on the first day of hearings for the two judges.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1

214. On 29 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal regarding two reporters for 
the independent weekly <i>Sawt al-Umma</i>: <b>Wael Al-Ibrashi</b> and <b>Hoda Abu Bakr</b>; and editor-in-
chief of the weekly <i>Afaq Arabiya: <b></b></i><b>Abdel Hakim Abdel Hamid</b>. According to the information 
received on 24 May 2006, the Egyptian state security prosecutor brought criminal charges 
against the three above-mentioned journalists. All the charges stem from articles that were 
published in December 2005. Both papers reported on the alleged fraud in the presidential 
election, which took place in 2005, listing the initials of several judges allegedly involved in the 
fraud. It was reported that they face up to three years of imprisonment. Concern was expressed at 
the recourse to criminal proceedings, particularly in light of reported recent pattern of 
harassment against members of the judiciary and their supporters expressing critical views 
against the Government, including arrests of and assault against participants of demonstrations in 
support of judges who openly criticized irregularities during the presidential election. 
 
215. On 1 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture 
sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>Karim al-Sha'ir</b> and <b>Mohamed al-Sharqawi</b>, political activists. 
According to the information received: on 25 May 2006 agents of the State Security 
Investigations (SSI) bureau of the Interior Ministry in downtown Cairo arrested al-Sha'ir and al-
Sharqawi, as they were leaving a peaceful demonstration commemorating the one-year 
anniversary of clashes between journalists and demonstrators urging a boycott of a constitutional 
referendum and law enforcement organs. Both men were subjected to severe beatings during the 
arrest and then taken into custody where beatings continued. Once in custody, police beat Mr al-
Sharqawi for hours targeting particular places. One of the officers ordered al-Sharqawi's pants to 
be removed and began squeezing his left testicle. He then was raped with a cardboard tube. The 
State Security prosecutor ordered both men to be held for 15 days pending investigations. The 
authorities allowed al-Sharqawi access to medical treatment only on 29 May 2006. Both men had 
been in detention twice in Tora prison following their participation in earlier protests on 24 April 
and 7 May respectively. They had been released on 22 May 2006.  
 
216. On 27 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>Ibrahim Eissa</b> 
and <b>Sahar Zaki</b>, an editor and reporter of the independent weekly <i>Al-Dustour </i>respectively. 
According to the information received, on 26 June 2006, the court in Al-Warrak sentenced 
Ibrahim Eissa and Sahar Zaki to one-year imprisonment, reportedly for insulting the Egyptian 
President. The charges stemmed from a news article published on 5 April 2005, which described 
the effort by an Egyptian lawyer to sue the President and his family for alleged corruption, 
including the allegation of misuse of foreign aid. Mr Eissa and Ms Zaki were not present for the 
verdict. They were free on bail of 10000 Egyptian pounds. It was reported that they had 
appealed.  
 
<b>Replies from the Government 
 
</b>217. On 11 July 2006, the Government of Egypt replied to the communications dated 5 May 
2006. The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that the Judge Mahmud Sadiq Birham, 
had filed a complaint with the Department of Public Prosecutions, stating that, during the 
National Assembly elections, he had chaired the general committee for the Nabruh district, 
which had performed its duties to the best of its ability. He asked for criminal action to be </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 85 
 
brought against those who had defamed him, in an article published in <i>the Sawt al-Ummah</i> 
newspaper on 12 December 2005, entitled &#8220;Blacklist of judges accused of rigging the elections&#8221;, 
which gave the initials of his three part name (M.S.B.) and named the election committee he 
chaired as well as a front-page story published in the <i>Afaq Arabiyah</i> newspaper on 22 December 
2005, listing full names, including his own, as those of judges who had rigged the elections. The 
Government informed the Special Rapporteur that investigations had revealed that the press 
statements had come from <b>Judge Mahmoud Maki</b> and <b>Judge Hisham Bastawissi</b>, without 
providing any proof of the allegations against the judge. These elements constitute the offence of 
defamation, which is a crime under the Criminal Code, for which the two men were therefore 
sent before a disciplinary tribunal in accordance with article 99 of the Judicial Authority Act. On 
18 May 2006, the judicial disciplinary tribunal, chaired by the chief justice of the Court of 
Cassation, acquitted Judge Mahmoud Maki, because his remarks, namely that an investigation 
was needed to verify the report, had been deleted from the report.  On the other hand, Judge 
Hisham Bastawissi, deputy chief justice of the Court of Cassation, was found guilty and was 
censured by the disciplinary board, what does not prevent a judge from carrying out his work. 
The Government reassured that the investigation of the two judges was based on a complaint 
brought by the victim for defamation, recognized under the Egyptian Criminal Code. The 
Department of Public Prosecutions, which is part of the judiciary, launched the investigation on 
the basis of the victim&#8217;s complaint and referred both judges to the competent disciplinary 
tribunal for a judicial hearing in accordance with the Judicial Authority Act. The investigation 
was not launched because of a complaint about the views of the two judges on the parliamentary 
elections or judicial reform.  Moreover, the draft law on amending the Judicial Authority Act 
was publicized as soon as it had been given Cabinet approval.  A delegation from the Judges&#8217; 
Club met with the speaker of the Advisory Council and the speaker of the National Assembly to 
present the Club&#8217;s views on the draft. It is false that judges <b>Nagi Derbala, Ahmed Saber, 
Ahmed Mekki </b>and<b> Mahmoud al-Khudayri</b> were investigated for expressing their views about 
the parliamentary elections and judicial reform. The disciplinary case was only brought against 
Judge Hisham Bastawissi and Judge Mahmoud Maki. 
 
218. On 7 of July 2006, the Government of Egypt responded to the communication dated 16 of 
May 2006 concerning various journalists including <b>Abeer al-Askary</b>, from the independent 
weekly <i>Al-Dustour</i>, <b>Yasir Suleiman </b>and<b> Nasri Yousif</b>, from <i>Al-Jazeera<b></b></i><b>,</b> <b>Saher al Gad</b>, A 
journalist for <i>Al-Geel</i> newspaper; and <b>Ibrahim Sahari</b>, A journalist for <i>Al-Alam Al-Youm</i> 
newspaper. The Ministry of the Interior confirmed that, on 11 May 2006, a number of citizens 
took part in a demonstration in central Cairo timed to coincide with a disciplinary hearing in 
which two judges had been summoned to appear.  The demonstrators had not obtained prior 
authorization as required under the Act regulating demonstrations on the public highway. The 
security forces warned the demonstrators about the adverse consequences of holding a 
demonstration in the city centre, but they failed to respond and tried to attack the security forces.  
This led to clashes and the arrest of several demonstrators, who were subsequently handed over 
to the Department of Public Prosecutions. The Department of Public Prosecutions opened an 
investigation in Higher State Security case No. 457/2006, establishing that some of the 
defendants were members of the Muslim Brotherhood, a proscribed organization. Regarding the 
journalists arrested during the demonstration, both Rasha Azab Ahmad Ibrahim and Nadi Hasan 
Abd al-Fatih al-Qisas were released on 6 June 2006. The Government highlighted that Egyptian 
Law is in compliance with international treaties, which state that the exercise of the right to 
engage in peaceful demonstrations must not prejudice national security, public safety or public </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 86 
 
order (article 21 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). With regard to the 
assault on <b>Mahmud Mohammed Abd al-Latif Hamzah</b>, a judge of the North Cairo court of 
first instance (Mission&#8217;s fax No. 804, dated 6 May 2006), the Department of Public Prosecutions 
opened an investigation into this incident, registered as Nile Palace criminal case No. 5476/2006, 
in which some protestors gathered at night in front of the Judges&#8217; Club, where the above-
mentioned judge and his brother happened to be. The judge was assaulted during the breakup of 
the protest.  He was not known to the police and was carrying a firearm. The chief investigator of 
the Department of Public Prosecutions went to the hospital just after the incident occurred and 
took statements from the victims, Mahmud Mohammed Abd al-Latif Hamzah and his brother. 
They both gave the names and descriptions of the policemen who had assaulted them.  Medical 
reports on the victims were appended to the investigation file.  The Department of Public 
Prosecutions questioned three police officers and charged them with assault. The case is still 
under investigation and will remain so until a full legal medical report has been submitted. 
 
219. On 11 July 2006, the Government of Egypt responded to the communication dated 29 of 
May 2005 concerning two reporters for the independent weekly Sawt al-Umma <b>Wael Al-Ibrashi</b> 
and <b>Hoda Abu Bakr</b>; and editor-in-chief of the weekly Afaq Arabiya <b>Abdel Hakim Abdel 
Hamid.</b> The Government noted that Justice Mahmud Sadiq had asked for a criminal 
investigation to be undertaken against all those who had defamed him or had wrongly published 
the allegation that he and other judges had rigged the elections. The Department of Public 
Prosecutions launched an investigation, registered as Azbakiyah criminal case No. 7770/2006. 
The accused person Huda Abu Bakr Hussein said that, a week before the publication of the news 
item bearing her name, <i>Sawt al-Ummah</i> newspaper had commissioned her to cover a conference 
being held by the Bar Association in Cairo.  When she went there the accused, Jamal al-Din Taj 
al-Din Hasan, the main source of the report, said that there had been irregularities during the 
elections and that judges had allegedly committed electoral fraud.  He said that the Association 
intended to take action against them and would be issuing a list of their names.  The 
complainant&#8217;s name was included in the published list of names of judges accused of rigging the 
elections.  The journalist wrote a report on the conference proceedings and on the judges&#8217; names 
and submitted it to the accused Wa&#8217;il Hasan al-Abrashi, executive editor of Sawt al-Ummah 
newspaper, who approved the news item and published it.  The accused said that what she had 
heard had been printed, but she did not know whether or not there was any evidence to support 
it. Accused person Abd al-Hakim Abd al-Hamid Ahmad Mohammed al-Shami, editor of <i>Afaq al-
Arabiyah</i> newspaper, said that the editor-in-chief had approved the publication of the article in 
question, after a fax had arrived at the newspaper from the Bar Association bearing the title 
&#8220;Black list of judges who committed fraud&#8221;.  The editor had contacted lawyer Jamal al-Din Taj 
al-Din, a member of the Bar Association, the latter confirmed the contents of the report, and so 
he went ahead with publication.  He added that two days after the news item was published, he 
had received a call from Jamal Taj al-Din who told him that Mahmud Birham Sadiq&#8217;s name had 
been included in the list by mistake.  So, he published a correction, in issue 742 of the 
newspaper, and concluded by saying that a person cannot be accused of something on hearsay 
and that allegations must be verified before publication. Mahmud Atiyah Mahmud Atiyah, 
editor-in-chief of Afaq al-Arabiyah newspaper, said that the accused Abd al-Hakim Abd al-
Hamid Ahmad Mohammed al-Shami had been standing in for him at the newspaper and 
therefore had the authority to approve the publication of news stories.  The Department of Public 
Prosecutions sent the aforementioned persons for trial before the Cairo Court of Appeal for 
committing acts that are offences under articles 171, 302-303 and 307 of the Criminal Code.  </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 87 
 
The penalty for this offence is a term of from 24 hours to two years in prison and/or a fine of 
from 10 to 20,000 Egyptian pounds.  The hearing was scheduled for 18 June 2006. The 
Government highlighted that Egyptian law criminalizes public defamation by means of 
publication in accordance with international norms enshrined in international human rights law 
and pursuant to articles 19 and 39 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Egyptian law, 
pursuant to article 302 of the Criminal Code, recognizes the freedom to criticize the actions of a 
public official, a person working for the Department of Public Prosecutions or a person entrusted 
with public service.  Such criticism is not classified as an offence, if it is done in good faith and 
does not impede the performance of public duties, public service or prosecution service, and 
provided that the person making the criticism has evidence to substantiate the allegations made 
against the persons concerned. 
 
220. By letter dated 11 July 2006, the Government replied to the communication of 1 June 2006 
concerning <b>Mohammed Hasan al-Sharqawi</b>, and <b>Karim Mohammed Umar, aka Karim al-
Sha'ir</b>, who were arrested on 25 May 2006, in Higher State Security Case No. 517, for taking 
part in, provoking and orchestrating a riot involving over 100 persons.  The offences committed 
during the riot include:  spreading seditious propaganda and falsehoods of a kind likely to 
prejudice public security; deliberately disrupting the movement of public transport; and 
interfering with the exercise of public authority by using violence, threats and insults against 
police officers performing their public duties. The Department of Public Prosecutions launched 
an investigation after the two men gave statements indicating that they had been beaten by the 
police at the time of their arrest. The first accused person, Mohammed Hasan al-Sharqawi, added 
that he had also been beaten around the genitalia.  The Department of Public Prosecutions 
questioned the two men and the examination confirmed that they had signs of injury on their 
bodies.  After questioning them, the Department of Public Prosecutions decided to have a legal 
doctor perform a medical examination in order to determine the cause and nature of the injuries 
and how they had occurred.  The Department of Public Prosecutions further decided to place the 
two men in detention for 15 days in connection with the case, which is still under investigation. 
The Department of Public Prosecutions, a branch of the judiciary whose members enjoy judicial 
immunity, investigated the incident involving Mohammed Hasan al-Sayid al-Sharqawi and 
Karim Mohammed Umar, aka Karim al-Sha`ir.  It defended both men with regard to the assault 
carried out by the police.  It interviewed them, looked at their external injuries and referred them 
to a legal doctor to determine the state of their injuries and proceed with the investigation in light 
of the findings of the competent legal doctor.

<p>224. On 29 November 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning the 
alleged death of three journalists, <b>Seyoum Tsehaye</b> (or Fsehaye), freelance, <b>Dawit 
Habtemichael</b>, deputy editor and co-founder of Meqaleh, and a journalist who is thought to be 
the editor of Tsigenay, <b>Yusuf Mohamed Ali</b>, in the prison of Eiraeiro. Other journalists are 
allegedly detained at Eiraeiro jail, but their health conditions are unknown. Their names are 
<b>Medhane Tewelde</b> (also identified as Medhane Haile), deputy editor and co-founder of Keste 
Debena, <b>Temesghen Gebreyesus</b>, journalist and member of the Keste Debena board, <b>Said 
Abdulkader</b>, editor and founder of Admas, <b>Emanuel Asrat</b>, editor of Zemen, Fessahaye 
&quot;Joshua&quot; Yohannes, playwright and journalist with the newspaper Setit. According to 
information received, approximately 65 political prisoners, including former ministers, high-
ranking civil and military officers, personalities of the opposition and several journalists, are 
reportedly held at the Eiraeiro detention centre. The majority was arrested in the aftermath of the 
protests of September 2001 and, to date, no charges were presented against them nor were they 
brought before a court.  
 
225. On 1 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, sent an urgent appeal concerning the arrest and 
detention of <b>9 media workers</b>. Since 12 November 2006, there has been a round-up of 
journalists and press officials. The security forces have been making daily visits to the 
information ministry, where the public media are based, and have been questioning media 
employees without providing any explanation as to the facts and charges being investigated. 
Reports indicate that at least 9 employees working for the state-owned media have been arrested. 
They are <b>Ahmed Baja</b> of Eri-TV, <b>Senait Tesfay</b> of Eri-TV, <b>Paulos Kidane</b> of Eri-TV and 
Radio Dimtsi Hafash; <b>Daniel Mussie</b> of Radio Dimtsi Hafash, <b>Temesghen Abay</b> of Radio 
Dimtsi Hafash, <b>Yemane Haile</b> of Eritrean News Agency, Fethia of Eri-TV, Simon of Eri-TV, 
and another journalist working for Eri-TV. The place of their detention has not been disclosed. In 
view of their alleged detention at an undisclosed location, we are concerned that the nine media 
workers named above might be at risk of torture or other forms of ill-treatment. Grave concern is 
expressed moreover at the series of arrests which may be an attempt to intimidate their media 
related work. This concern is aggravated by the high number of currently detained journalists in 
Eritrea, which reportedly numbers at least 22. </p>

227. On 5 January 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning a group of 
<b>131 persons, </b>including<b> leaders of the opposition Coalition for Unity and Democracy (CUD)</b> 
party and <b>13 journalists</b>. According to the information, on 3 January 2006, the High Court 
denied bail to the said 131 persons, accused of treason, inciting violence and planning to commit 
genocide, in relation to a wave of protests following the victory of the ruling party in the May 
2005 elections. During the hearing, a CUD leader <b>Berhanu Nega</b> claimed that charges were 
fabricated and that the defendants refused to recognize the decision of the Court. Defence 
lawyers did not appear in court because the prison administration had allegedly barred them from 
meeting with their clients prior to the hearing. Under Ethiopian law, the possible sentences 
defendants would face if they were found guilty, ranges from three years' imprisonment to the 
death penalty. In June and November 2005, thousands of Ethiopians were arrested and around 40 
people died because of violent clashes among protesters and security forces. The trial was 
postponed until February.  
 
228. On 24 February 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>Frezer 
Negash</b>, correspondent for the United states based website <i>Ethiopian Review</i>; <b>Iyob Demeke</b>, 
former editor-in-chief of the defunct Amharic-language weekly <i>Tarik</i> and <b>Elias Gudissa</b>, editor-
in-chief of the Amharic-language weekly <i>Tikusat</i>. According to the information received: Frezer 
Negash was arrested on 27 January 2006, and had been remanded in detention in Addis Ababa 
for further enquiries without charge.  She had been called to appear in court at least twice, but 
was sent back to detention without any charge against her. She was several months pregnant. 
Moreover, on 8 February, Iyob Demeke was sentenced to pay a fine for having failed to print the 
name of the newspaper&#8217;s deputy editor on its masthead.  He was imprisoned on the same day, 
and was not released until the fine was paid on 14 February. Furthermore, on 10 February, Elias 
Gudissa was sentenced to pay a fine for defaming the government and printing misinformation in 
an article several years ago.  The article was about the dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea.  He 
was imprisoned on 10 February, and was not released until the fine was paid on 15 February.   
 
229. On 5 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, 
sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>Abraham Roda</b>, a farmer; <b>Abraham Tula</b>, a former Sidama 
Development Corporation employee; <b>Abure Assefa</b> , a civil servant; <b>Dessalegne Gassamo</b>, a 
USAID advisor on education; <b>Edasso Ebissa</b>, a farmer; <b>Musse Alemayehu</b>, a civil servant at the 
agricultural department; <b>Tadesse Washo</b>, a nurse; <b>Tefera Janba</b>, a student of Awassa Tabour 
School; <b>Yosef Lalimo</b>, Awassa Tabour, a school student; and approximately 50 other persons in 
detention after their arrest in Awassa town, Southern Regional State. According to the 
information received, hundreds of persons, including students, were arrested when the federal 
police intervened during peaceful demonstrations that took place on 12 March 2006 in Awassa 
town, Southern Regional State, and in other nearby towns. The demonstrators were demanding </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 90 
 
greater political representation for the Sidama people. Demonstrators were beaten by the federal 
police, and some were allegedly shot dead. Most of the demonstrators have in the meantime been 
released from custody without being charged, some after having been taken to court in Awassa. 
The above-mentioned individuals and approximately 50 other demonstrators, however, remained 
in detention at the date this communication was sent. Most of those still in custody were arrested 
in Awassa and Yirgalem and were reportedly being held in Awassa prison. Some others were 
held in other prisons and police stations, including Yirgalem, Lakoo, and Wondo. Mr Tefera 
Janba was reportedly tortured in custody and is in need for medical treatment.  
 
230. On 5 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding Mr <b>Mesfin 
Woldermarian</b>, former chair of the Ethiopian Human Rights Council, Mr <b>Netsanet Demissie</b>, 
an environmental rights lawyer and founder of the Organization for Social Justice in Ethiopia, 
Mr <b>Daniel Bekele</b>, a policy, research and advocacy manager of the non- governmental 
organization Action Aid and Mr <b>Kassahun Kebede</b>, chair of the Addis Ababa branch of the 
Ethiopian Teachers Association (ETA). Mr Daniel Bekele was the subject of two previously sent 
urgent appeals. Mr Demissie was mentioned in the urgent appeal sent on 18 November 2005. 
According to the information received, Mr Mesfin Woldermarian, Mr Netsanet Demissie, Mr 
Daniel Bekele and Mr Kassahun Kebede were in prison and were facing charges of treason, at 
the date this communication was sent. Their trial was due to begin in May and if convicted they 
might face the death penalty. All of the above- mentioned people were arrested because of their 
participation in pro-democracy demonstrations in 2005. Grave concern was expressed that the 
charges against Mr Mesfin Woldermarian, Mr Netsanet Demissie, Mr Daniel Bekele and Mr 
Kassahun Kebede were in particular because of their participation in peaceful protests.  
 
231. On 11 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning <b>Wosonseged 
Gebrekidan</b>, editor of the banned <i>Addis Zena</i> newspaper. According to the information 
received, on 18 April 2006, Wosonseged Gebrekidan, who was a subject of communication sent 
by the Special Rapporteur on 18 November 2005, was sentenced to 16 months' imprisonment for 
defamation for an article published in 2002, in which he allegedly defamed the editor of 
Abyotawi Democracy, a publication of Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front. The 
article appeared in the Amharic language weekly Ethiop, which Gebrekidan was editor at the 
time. According to the information received, Gebrekidan had already been serving an eight-
month sentence, which was handed down in December 2005 regarding another article published 
in 2002, allegedly defaming a foreign diplomat. It was reported that he was amongst the 14 
editors and reporters of privately-owned newspapers, who had been arrested and charged with 
treason, outrages against the Constitution, incitement to armed conspiracy and defamation. 
 
232. On 17 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning <b>Tesehalene 
Mengesha</b>, a former deputy editor for the defunct Amharic-language weekly <i>Mebruk</i>. According 
to the information received, Mr Mengesha was convicted in the beginning of May 2006, and 
subsequently sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment for defamation. The charge against him 
stems from an article published in <i>Mebruk</i> during the border conflict between Ethiopia and 
Eritrea in 1998-2000, in which he described an individual as a double agent. He was reportedly 
held in Kality Prison on the outskirts of Addis Ababa. Concern was expressed, particularly in 
light of the reports indicating that his arrest and detention follow a pattern of arrests and charges </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1

against 14 editors and reporters of privately-owned newspapers, who had been arrested and 
charged with treason, outrages against the Constitution, incitement to armed conspiracy and 
defamation. 
 
233. On 8 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning Mr <b>Eskinder 
Negga</b>, editor of the newspaper <i>Satenaw</i>; his partner Ms <b>Serkalem Fasil;</b> and their baby. 
According to the information received,: on 28 November 2005, Eskinder Negga was arrested 
with many other journalists, human rights defenders and opposition members in the wake of 
demonstrations against alleged fraud in the parliamentary elections held in May 2005. He was 
charged with &#8220;treason&#8221;, &quot;outrages against the Constitution&quot; and &quot;incitement to armed 
conspiracy&quot;, which could carry the death penalty. Reportedly, Eskinder Negga had been moved 
from Addis Ababa's Kaliti prison to Karchele prison, where he was detained in a maximum 
security section known for its very harsh conditions, at the time this communication was sent. 
Ms Serkalem Fasil had also been arrested and detained at Kaliti prison where she gave birth to a 
baby boy in late June 2006. Both the mother and the infant were still held in Kaliti prison at the 
time this communication was sent, and they had not been authorized to meet with Mr Negga. 
Reports indicated that the issue for his transfer had been raised by other defendants during the 
last court hearing on 6 August 2006, but remained unclear as the judge did not offer any 
explanation as to why. 
 
234. On 28 September 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture and Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding Mr <b>Wasihun Melese</b> and Mr <b>Anteneh Getnet</b>, both 
members of the Ethiopian Teachers' Association (ETA), a teachers&#8217; union. According to the 
information received, on 23 September 2006, Mr Wasihun Melese was arrested by police. The 
police took him to the police Central Investigation Bureau (known as Maekelawi), where he was 
still detained at the date this communication was sent. Shortly after Mr Melese&#8217;s arrest, three 
men in plain clothes entered the ETA's office in Addis Ababa, where an Addis Ababa Region 
teachers&#8217; meeting was being held. They were later seen leaving the office in a car with Anteneh 
Getnet, also a teacher. His whereabouts are still unknown. Mr Getnet had previously been 
abducted and beaten in May 2006, allegedly by members of the security forces. He is still 
suffering from injuries sustained when he was beaten. Concern was expressed that their arrest 
and detention might be linked to their activity in defence of labour rights, as well as to 
statements critical of the Government issued by ETA in the period following the May 2005 
elections. 
 
235. On 23 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture 
and Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, 
sent an urgent appeal concerning Ms <b>Yalemzewd Bekele</b>, a lawyer working on projects related 
to human rights and civil society for the European Commission&#8217;s office in Addis Ababa, and 
prominent civil rights lawyer who volunteered with the <i>Ethiopian Women Lawyers' Association</i> 
(EWLA), Addis Ababa. According to the allegations received, on the morning of 19 October 
2006, Ms <b>Bekele</b> was arrested by the Ethiopian authorities, while trying to cross the border to </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 92 
 
Kenya. It is believed that Ms <b>Bekele</b> was accompanied by another person at the time of her 
arrest. The identity and whereabouts of this person are not known. Ms <b>Bekele</b> appears to have 
been arrested in connection with the publication and distribution by the political opposition 
Coalition for Unity and Democracy (CUD) of a calendar of action for non-violent civil 
disobedience. Concern was expressed that Ms <b>Bekele</b> may have been arrested in connection with 
her human rights activities, in particular due to her involvement in the publication and 
distribution of the CUD Calendar of action calling for non-violent civil disobedience.  
<b> 
Replies from the Government 
 
</b>236. On 7 of June 2006, the Government of Ethiopia replied to the communication dated 5 of 
May 2006 regarding the detention of <b>Professor Mesfin W. Mariam, Mr Netsanet Demissie, 
Mr Daniel Bekele </b>and<b> Mr Kassahun Kebede</b>. The Government stated that Ethiopia had held 
regional and federal legislative elections in May 2005 and explained that the leadership of the 
main opposition party CUD and others who participated in street-riots aimed at overthrowing the 
government through unlawful means. For this reason, and not for their participation in &#8220;pro-
democracy&#8221; demonstrations in 2005, they had been arrested and charged with the crimes of high 
treason, outrages against the constitution and the constitutional order, obstruction of the exercise 
of constitutional powers, armed up-rising or civil was, impairment of the defensive power of the 
state and attempted genocide. The Government added that the ongoing trial was carried out in an 
open, fair and transparent manner in the presence of international observers, and that the rights of 
the accused to due process was guaranteed in line with the relevant international conventions.  
 
237. By letter dated 25 August 2006, the Government of Ethiopia replied to the communication 
of 8 of August 2006 concerning <b>Mr Eskinder Nega</b>, an editor of a local newspaper and his 
spouse <b>Ms Serkalem Fasil</b>. The Government highlighted that due process as guaranteed by the 
Constitution and international obligations of the country were respected. The accused on trial are 
in custody for their alleged commission of grave crimes and are detained separately in 
accordance with Ethiopian law and internationally accepted standards. 
 
238. On 9 November 2006, the Government of Ethiopia replied to the communication of 23 
October 2006 regarding <b>Ms Yalemzewd Bekele</b>, a lawyer working for the European 
Commission Office in Addis Ababa and Mr <b>Alemaychu Fantu</b>, a businessman based in Addis 
Ababa. The Government stated that the content of the communication was unfounded. The arrest 
Mr Fantu and Ms Bekele was not arbitrary, but in accordance with Ethiopian Criminal Procedure 
Code and accepted international standards and the allegation of torture and ill treatment during 
arrest unfounded.. Their arrest is related to alleged crimes committed in violation of the 
Ethiopian penal law and not connected in the case of Ms Bekele, to her association with EWLA, 
and in the case of Mr Fantu with this business activities or political activism. While in detention 
both accused were allowed visits of their families. Ms Bekeles made no allegation of torture 
when released on bail on 26 October 2006. Human rights monitors, including the Special 
Rapporteur on Prisons and Conditions of Detention in Africa of the African Human and People&#8217;s 
Rights Commission have visited the prisons and released reports with findings that the 
conditions in these prisons, meet international standards.

<b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b> 
239. By letter dated 3 March 2006, the Government of Ethiopia replied to the communication 
of 15 December 2005 regarding the detention of journalists <b>Wosengesed Gebrekidan, 
Getachew Simi and Leykun Engeda</b>. The Government stated that these journalists were 
detained by law enforcement bodies for their alleged acts contrary to provisions of the Penal 
Code and Proclamation N.34/1992 governing freedom of expression. They were charged with 
serious infractions of existing press proclamation and provisions of the Penal Code. While on 
trial, their due process rights were guaranteed. It was also reported that the lower court has 
already passed verdict on these charges, finding the defendant guilty of committing defamation. 
One of the journalists lodged an appeal against the decision and the appeal was pending before a 
higher court at the time this letter was sent. It was further reported that the second category of 
journalists included those imprisoned by court order for committing alleged criminal offences 
associated with the post May 2005 Election disturbances in Ethiopia. The law enforcement 
authorities detained a number of journalists who took part in the opposition&#8217;s attempt to change 
the Government unconstitutionally through street violence. According to information received 
from the Government, these individuals are not political prisoners but alleged perpetrators of 
criminal acts. The Government indicated that these journalists who have allegedly conspired to 
overthrow the Government though illegal means were detained and charged with crimes of 
genocide, treason and attempt to change the Government through unconstitutional means. The 
Government acknowledged the pivotal role freedom of the press plays in the country&#8217;s 
democratization process. During the Prime Minister&#8217;s report presented to the House of Peoples&#8217; 
Representatives on 13 February 2006, he declared that the Government remained committed to a 
continuous reform of the existing press legislations with the view to further strengthening press 
freedom in the country and realize the full implementation of the individual right to freedom of 
expression and opinion.

Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, sent an urgent appeal regarding two journalists working 
for <i>The Independent</i>: editor-in-chief <b>Musa Saidykhan</b>; and general manager <b>Madi Ceesay</b>. 
According to the information received, on 27 March, Musa Saidykhan was arrested. On the 
following day, the offices of <i>The Independent</i> were raided and sealed by security forces, and all 
staff members present were detained by the police from the Criminal Investigation Department 
and the elite Police Intervention Unit. Most of the staff members were later released, but Musa 
Saidykhan and Madi Ceesay were still detained at the date this communication was sent. Charges 
against them were unknown, and they were not allowed to see any visiters. Their arrest and 
detention followed a story published on the newspaper in the previous week, questioning the 
wealth of the president. The same edition also contained an article by Madi Ceesay, which was 
critical of the alleged coup plot on 21 March 2006, and the coup that brought the President into 
power in 1994. Concern was expressed that the two journalists' arrest and detention were directly 
related to their journalistic work. Concern was hightened in light of reports on several previous 
attacks against the offices and staff members of <i>The Independent</i>.  
 
244. On 7 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the

alleged coup attempt of 21 March 2006, including <b>Vincent Jatta</b>, <b>Mariam Denton</b>, <b>Ngorr 
Secka</b>, <b>Foday Barry</b>, <b>Kemo Balajo</b> and <b>Buba Saho</b>. According to the information received, 
sixteen persons had been arrested and were detained in connection with the alleged coup attempt 
of 21 March. They had been charged with treason and conspiracy, which carry the death penalty. 
Their trial was adjourned first to 26 May and then to 2 June. At least eight other persons were 
detained without charge at the date this communication was sent, some of them incommunicado. 
They included: former chief of staff Lieutenant Colonel Vincent Jatta, senior lawyer Mariam 
Denton, former NIA acting deputy director general Ngorr Secka, NIA Director of Operations 
Foday Barry, former NIA senior officer Kemo Balajo, and NIA official Buba Saho. It was 
alleged that lawyers apart from the ones for Mariam Denton had been denied access to their 
clients, or could not meet with them in private. Moreover, on 14 May, reporter Lamin Fatty was 
charged with publishing false information in relation to an article he wrote which suggested that 
a high-ranking official was among those arrested for the alleged coup attempt in March. Despite 
the apology published by his newspaper, Lamin Fatty continued to face those charges. He had 
not appeared in court, at the date this communication was sent.

the Prime Minister was removed from office on 15 December 2004. It was also indicated that Mr 
Zaur Kvaratskhalia, Head of the Department of Relations with Georgian Diaspora and Inter-
ethnic relations at the Presidents Office of Administration received a disciplinary warning. The 
Government stated that Mr Nanuashvili did not make any official complaint to State authorities 
regarding the alleged violations outlined in the communication of 7 October 2005.

Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b> 
248. By letter dated 15 February 2006, the Government of Ghana replied to the communication 
of 20 July 2005 concerning the case of <b>Claude Decker, Thomas Kpakpo Thompson and 
Frank Boahene</b>. The Government attached the ruling of the High Court of Justice, which stated 
that the plaintiff was entitled to substantial damages because of the nature and content of the 
publication. The Court considered fair for the plaintiff to have eighty million Cedis damages and 
ordered the defendants to retract the publication and offer an apology to the plaintiff. The 
defendants refused to comply with the court order to publish a retraction in three issues of the 
paper and the Director of the paper did not appear in Court. The Constitution of Ghana in articles 
162 and 173 provides for a free, independent media, thus the Court sentenced the contemnors to 
15 days imprisonment each.

</b>249. On 24 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning Director 
<b>Lambros Smailis</b>, editors <b>Georgios Mantelis</b>, <b>Dimitrios Frangouliakis</b>, <b>Manolis Kottakis</b>, 
<b>Yannis Triiris</b>, and Reporter <b>Nikos Papadimitriou</b> for the daily newspaper <i>Apogevmatini</i>. 
According to information received, on 16 March 2006, they were to go on trial before the Three-
Member Misdemeanors Court of Athens for simple and aggravated defamation by the press 
(articles 362 and 363 of the Greek Penal Code), punishable with a prison sentence of three </p>

months to five years. They were all indicted for an article published on 24 May 2005. The trial 
was postponed to 26 June 2006, to coincide with a second trial for another defamation charge 
brought against Nikos Papadimitriou, for a separate article he wrote. Moreover, on 6 February 
2006, a Single-Member Misdemeanors First Instance Court of Patras convicted Journalist and 
News Editor <b>Constantinos Flamis</b> and Cameraman <b>Thanasis Kafetzis</b> of the Patras-based 
<i>Super B</i> television channel to eight months&#8217; imprisonment and a fine. This sentence was in 
connection with an interview they conducted with an Albanian migrant who was being arraigned 
for allegedly driving drunk in a stolen car on 11 November 2004. The conviction was based on 
article 8, paragraphs 2 and 3, of Law 3090/2002, which prohibits photographing or filming 
individuals while being arraigned in court; any violation of this article is punishable with up to 
three years in prison and a fine between &#8364;20,000 and &#8364; 200,000 . This law was introduced to 
protect individuals being arraigned from being photographed or filmed against their will. Both 
the Albanian and his lawyer testified in the 6 February 2006 trial that they had actually asked to 
be interviewed in order to denounce a reportedly racially-motivated attack by passers-by that the 
Albanian had allegedly suffered during his arrest on 10 November 2004. Concern was expressed 
at the recourse to criminal sanctions for media related offences.

aproximadamente 300 radios funcionan sin ning&#250;n tipo de regulaci&#243;n o control, y se ha 
manifestado que la mayor&#237;a de estas radios tienen intereses comerciales, pues su actividad no

informaci&#243;n educativa y cultural. Igualmente se inform&#243; que la SIT ha recibido alrededor de 303 
quejas argumentando violaci&#243;n de derechos de usufructuarios por el uso ilegal de frecuencias en

Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding Mr 
<b>Santhosh Patel</b>, staff member of the People&#8217;s Vigilance Committee on Human Rights 
(PCVHR). PCVHR is an organization that monitors human rights violations committed by the 
state authorities in Uttar Pradesh, India. According to the information received, on 10 May 2006, 
Mr Patel was arrested and detained while he was attending a meeting with local people and the 
District Magistrate. It was reported that Mr Patel attempted to present a petition to the District 
Magistrate concerning violations by the authorities of the right to food of local people. It was

<p>267. On 10 February 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning <b>four 
new public service broadcasting regulations</b> which had come into effect on 6 February 2006. 
The four regulations are based upon the Broadcasting Law of 2002, and deal with allocating 
frequencies, monitoring programmes, licensing broadcasting stations, as well as limiting foreign 
broadcast contents and foreign ownership of broadcasting outlets.  These regulations prevent 
local television and radio stations from directly relaying news broadcasts provided by foreign 
agencies, and as a result no real-time broadcast of content from foreign broadcasters can be 
broadcasted.  The power to issue broadcasting licences was transferred from the independent 
National Broadcasting Commission (KPI) to the Ministry of Communications and Information.  
 
268. On 7 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning <b>the 
barring of foreign media, churches and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in West 
Papua</b>. According to the information received, on 6 February 2006, the Minister of Defence 
Juwono Sudarsono made a public statement in the media, and stated that the Government would 
maintain the barring of foreign media from reporting from the province of Papua. He stated that 
the ban should be on all foreign media, churches and NGOs, including human rights 
organizations, as their presence in West Papua would be used as a platform by Papuans to 
publicize alleged human rights abuses. The ban against foreign media had effectively been in 
place since mid-2003, and had prevented any foreign journalists from having official access to 
the region. Severe concern was expressed that the barring of the foreign media, churches and 
NGOs might be a direct attempt to prevent them to report human rights abuses in West Papua. 
 
269. On 21 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>Selpius Bobii</b>, a student at the Catholic 
Theological College &#8220;Fajar Timur&#8221;, Jayapura, Papua, as well as <b>57 detainees</b>. According to the 
allegations received, on 16 March 2006, they were arrested and detained in Jayapura Police 
Station, and were denied access to lawyers. The students were protesting in Abepura in demand 
for the closure of mining operations in Timika, West Papua, and the withdrawal of the 
Indonesian army (TNI) and police, which provide security for the mining company. The 
protesters blocked the main road of Jayapura and the police instructed them to clear the roads, 
deploying water cannon and armoured vehicles. It was reported that Special Mobile Police 
Brigade (BRIMOB) officers used tear gas, and fired on the crowd of unarmed demonstrators. In 
response, the protesters threw stones, bottles and pieces of wood at the police. In the violence 
that ensued, it was reported that four policemen were killed and about nine were wounded. The 
following individuals were among those treated in a hospital, some in critical condition: Waena, 
Jayapura: Etinus Kulla, university student; Obatius Wanimbo, university student, treated for 
severe gun shot wounds; Ishak Ulmami, university student; John Giyai, university student;

Kogoya, Melky Komboy, Alex Wayangkau and Imanuel Ronsumbre were treated in another 
hospital in Jayapura. Since 22 February 2006, there had been series of protests organized by civil 
society groups demanding the closure of mining operations. 
 
270. On 18 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning a freelance 
journalist<b> Mr</b> <b>Herliyanto</b>, who was found dead on 29 April 2006 in the forest near Tarokan, 
Probolinggo District, in East Java province, after he had been seen being followed by several 
men on motorcycles. The cause of his death was reported to be stabbing. His camera and 
notebook were missing. Concern was expressed that his death was directly connected to his 
journalistic work, particularly in light of reports that he had been investigating and reporting on 
corruption in the local administration in Tulupari village, Probolonggo District.  
 
271. On 12 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegation 
concerning <b>staff members of the non governmental organization <i>Syarikat</i> and other 
participants in a peaceful gathering organized to commemorate the 1965 massacre</b>. <i>Syarikat 
</i>promotes reconciliation between the victims of the 1965 massacre and the perpetrators of the 
massacre. According to the information received, on 20 May 2006 approximately 100 
individuals belonging to the civil militia groups the Laskar Siliwangi (Siliwangi Army) and 
Pemuda Panca Marga (The Youth of Military Veterans) attacked and chased 200 people who 
were participating in a peaceful gathering organized by Syarikat to commemorate the 1965 
massacre. It was reported that the individuals belonging to Laskar Siliwangi and Pemuda Panca 
Marga threatened and intimidated the participants. It was alleged that when police officers 
arrived at the place of the incident, they questioned two members of <i>Syarikat</i>&#8217;s committee but 
did not question the members of Laskar Siliwangi and Pemuda Panca Marga.  
 
272. On 1 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegation 
regarding <b><i>International People&#8217;s Forum</i></b>  (IPF), a network of civil society groups and non- 
governmental organizations who were planning to hold peaceful rallies at the same time as the 
World Bank/International Monetary Fund meeting which was due to take place in Singapore on 
19 and 20 September 2006. The Batam Police authorities had rejected a request from IPF to hold 
peaceful demonstrations in Batam Island, during the World Bank/International Monetary Fund 
meeting. Allegedly the Batam Island Police Chief publicly stated &#8220;we will disperse them&#8221;, 
referring to the planned peaceful demonstrations. It had also been reported that the Indonesian 
Police Chief had stated that an elite anti-terror squad would arrest any protestors who were 
considered to be a security threat. Since no outdoor activities would be allowed, it was reported 
that several events had to be cancelled. Concerns were expressed that the alleged prohibition of 
peaceful protests in Batan island was aimed at preventing the activities of the International 
People&#8217;s Forum in defence of human rights, in particular their activities highlighting the impact 
of World Bank and IMF policies on women&#8217;s rights, trade and finance, the environment, migrant 
workers and indigenous peoples.

<b>Replies from the Government 
</b> 
273. On 3 May 2006, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal sent of 21 March 2006 
acknowledging that on 16th March 2006, forces of order clashed with protestors who were 
organizing a <b>demonstration in Abepura </b>to launch their opposition to several issues, including 
demanding the closure of the United States-owned Freeport McMoran copper and gold mines 
and operations. However, according to the Government, the clashed occured when police tried to 
persuade the demonstrators who were blocking access to the main road to disperse and the 
demonstrators, ignoring the police instead threw stones and other objects at the latter, mortally 
wounded four policemen and an Air Force officer. About 29 were injured and rushed off to 
Abepura hospital in Papua. The Government declared that, faced with the specter of a spreading 
violence, the Police in accordance with the existing law arrested 76 demonstrators, among whom 
it only declared 17 as suspects. The Government acknowledged that one of them was Selpius 
Bobil, the head of the West Papua Referendum Front, for questioning on his role as instigator in 
the final outcome of events. However, the Government indicated that 12 individuals, and not 57 
as alleged in the letter, were also arrested by the police at the Jayapura Police headquarters as the 
ongoing investigation into the cause of death and injury resulting from the clashed continue. The 
Government ensured that as set forth in the national legislation, each suspect was granted the 
right to be visited by family members and religious figures, and the right to be accompanied by 
lawyers at all levels of the investigation. The Government stated that contrary to allegations, the 
suspects have been accompanied by lawyers who had authority to act on their behalf and these 
were lawyers from the Coalition of Non-Governmental Organisations, which included: <b>Pieter 
Eli, SH; Paskalis Letson SH; L. Anum Siregar, SH; Adolf Waramori, SH; Iwan K.Niode, 
SH; Rahman Ramili, SH; Robert Korwa, SH; Yohannes Harry Maturbongs, SH; Sihar 
L.Tobling, SH; Cornelia Silva, SH; Jemy Noya, SH; Yusman Conoras, SH</b>. The Government 
added that Indonesia's National Commission of Human Rights has monitored the investigation 
process and has directly visited suspects in the Police headquarters. The Government ascertains 
that the cases aforementioned will be brought before the court in due time and they will have the 
right to argue their case or to launch an appeal against the ruling if necessary. 
 
274. By letter dated 3 May 2006, the Government replied to the communication of 10 February 
2006. The Government of Indonesia confirmed that it had adopted new regulations 
<b>Broadcasting Law 32/2002</b> in order to restructure the media industry which had operated 
without official control since 1998. These regulations include: No. 49/2005 on foreign 
broadcasters, No. 50/205 on private broadcasters, No. 51/2005 on community broadcasters and 
No. 52/2005 on foreign broadcasters. The Government explained that the authority to issue the 
broadcasting licenses was removed from the National Broadcasting Commission (KPI) and given 
to the Ministry of Information. KPI brought the case before the Constitutional Court questioning 
the authority of the Government to issue and revoke licences. In 2005, the Court ruled that the 
technical regulations should be dealt with by KPI, though the issuance and revocation of licences 
would be under the government&#8217;s domain. KPI brought the case to the Supreme Court, on which 
no verdict has been issued yet. The Government denied the alleged prohibition of certain media, 
but live and unedited broadcast of certain foreign news. As explained, the Government policy is 
to delay these broadcasts for a few seconds to ensure that unsuitable material can be censored. 
 
275. By letter dated 3 May 2006, the Government replied to the communication of 7 March 
2006 concerning the barring of <b>foreign media, churches and NGOs in Papua</b>. The </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 104 
 
Government explained that the existing ban in accessing the region already lasting for 18 months 
was justified by the situation of unrest and confrontation in Papua, which was caused by 
instability due in part to the disruptions caused by the separatist movement (OPM), as much as to 
the complexities of implementing the 2001 Papuan Special Autonomy Law. The Government 
stated that it could not guarantee the safety of visitors to the region and that elements external to 
the area might exacerbate internal strife. The Government emphasized that although the ban in 
place was not absolute, and requests to visit the province would be considered on a case &#8211;by- 
case basis. The Government indicated that it would consider revising this ban when the situation 
in Papua would sufficiently improve. 
 
276. By letter dated 20 July 2007, the Government replied to the communication dated 18 May 
2006, concerning the dead of the journalist <b>Mr</b> <b>Heriyanto</b>. The Government informed that he 
was found dead near Tarokan Village on 29 April 2006 and taken to the Probolinggo General 
Hospital for an autopsy, which revealed that his death was caused by multiple stab wounds. The 
Government indicated that unconfirmed reports stated that as <b>Mr</b> Herliyanto drove past Klenan 
market he was followed by five or six unknown assailants riding motorcycles. His motorbike 
was later found near his body. The Government informed that the police had started an 
investigation. The Jakarta-based Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI) had also launched a 
fact-finding investigation to discover if his death was directly related to the his journalistic work, 
particularly the reports he was allegedly working on regarding a series of corruption cases in the 
local area. According to the Probolinggo Police Detective chief, robbery was excluded as a 
motive, given that his motorbike had been found 30 metres away from Herliyanto&#8217;s body. As 
part of police investigations, police had traced a series of calls the victim just made prior to his 
death. Following the information received from the Government, the police had also continued to 
question various witnesses and suspects in order to find the perpetrators. Based on the 
testimonials of the witnesses, the police was able to rule out several possible motives for the 
murder. The investigations were ongoing at the time this reply was received. The Government of 
Indonesia condemned this murder and stressed the importance of reiterating its commitment to 
the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. 
 
<b>Observations

278. On 16 January 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary General on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding 
<b>Mr Mansour Ossanlu</b>, head of the Union of Workers of the Tehran and Suburbs Bus Company 
(Sherkat-e Vahed). On 22 December 2005, police reportedly arrested Mr Ossanlu at home in 
connection with his trade union activities. On the same day, 12 members of the Union were also 
arrested at their domiciles and, on 25 December, other Union members were arrested while 
manifesting for the release of their comrades. The unionists were released few days later with the 
exception of Mr Ossanlu, who remains detained, since 22 December 2005. Mr Ossanlu had not 
been granted access to a lawyer at the time this communication was sent, and could face charges </p>

including contact with Iranian opposition groups abroad and instigating armed revolt against the 
authorities. Moreover, he suffered from a severe eye trouble and needs immediate medical 
treatment.  
 
279. On 3 February 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, sent an urgent appal concerning the following 
persons: <b>Reza Haidari</b>, aged 11; <b>Kazem Sayahi</b>, aged 14; <b>Hashem Jassem Sawari</b>, aged 18; 
<b>Hadi Washahi</b>, aged 17; <b>Said Manabi</b>, aged 20; <b>Saleh &#8216;Abidawi</b>, imam (prayer leader); <b>Sheikh 
Saleh al-Haydari</b>, imam of Da&#8217;ira mosque. According to the information received, a group of 
people including the seven people named above, all members of Iran&#8217;s Arab minority, were 
reportedly arrested in the city of Ahvaz in Khuzestan province on 11 and 12 January 2006. The 
arrests took place after clashes in Ahvaz between Iranian security forces and members of the 
Arab Ahwazi community. The clashes followed an initially peaceful demonstration which took 
place on the Muslim festival of &#8216;Id al-Adha on 11 January 2006, led by Sheikh Saleh al-Haydari, 
imam of Da&#8217;ira mosque in Ahvaz. Demonstrators were reportedly demanding an end to the 
persecution of Arabs, poverty and unemployment among Arabs, and the release of political 
prisoners arrested following unrest in Khuzestan province which began in April 2005. On 12 
January 2006, more arrests followed in the city of Hamidiya, after a demonstration against the 
arrests which had taken place on &#8216;Id al-Adha, the previous day. It was also alleged that at least 
three men were killed during the clashes between 11 and 12 January 2006 by the security forces 
in the Khuzestan region and around 40 others wounded. It was also reported that Sheikh Saleh 
al-Haydari had been on hunger strike since 25 January 2006 in protest at his detention. The 
authorities had reportedly accused him of threatening national security.  
 
280. On 16 February 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, sent an urgent appeal regarding Ms <b>Elham 
Afroutan</b> and up to <b>six other journalists</b> from the provincial weekly <i>Tammadon-e Hormozgan</i>. 
According to information received, they were arrested in Bandar Abbas, Hormozgan, on 29 
January 2006, just after the publication on <i>Tammadon-e Hormozgan</i> of a satirical article about 
the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran. Elham Afroutan and her six colleagues had not been 
formally charged, nor have they had access to legal representation.  
 
281. On 1 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, the 
Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, the Special Rapporteur on the independence 
of judges and lawyers, the Independent Expert on Minority Issues and the Special Rapporteur on 
the question of torture, sent an urgent appeal concerning <b>173 members of the Nematollah Sufi 
Muslim community</b>. According to the information received, on 13 February 2006, they were 
arrested due to their participation in a peaceful protest, which was reportedly violently 
suppressed by the security forces and members of the Hojatieh and Fatemiyon pro-government 
groups. The protest was being held against an order by the security forces to evacuate the 
community's place of worship, known as Hosseiniye.  The 173 individuals were reportedly being 
interrogated at Fajr prison in Qom, at the time this communication was sent, and there were 
concerns that they were being tortured in order to force them to sign pre-prepared false 
confessions, stating that the protest had political motivations and was linked to anti-Government 
groups. The relatives of the detainees had been unable to obtain official information about their 
whereabouts and the detainees had not had access to lawyers.  According to the information </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 106 
 
received, lawyer Bahman Nazari was arrested when he approached officials in an attempt to 
represent the detainees. The protest began on 9 February 2006. On 13 February 2006, there were 
hundreds of protesters present in and around the Hosseiniye.  The security forces set a deadline 
for the protesters to evacuate the Hosseiniye. Members of the Fatemiyon and Hojatieh groups 
surrounded the place of worship, shouting anti-Sufi slogans, and distributed leaflets alleging that 
Sufis are enemies of Islam. The security forces moved in and stormed the building using tear gas 
and explosives. They beat many of the protesters.  The next day the Hosseiniye was demolished 
using bulldozers. Approximately 1,200 protesters were arrested and taken away to unknown 
locations.  The detainees were interrogated and reportedly many were subjected to torture or ill-
treatment. Most of them were subsequently released. However, 173 were still held at the date 
this communication was sent. According to the information received, those that were released 
were required to sign papers as a condition of their release agreeing not to attend any Sufi 
gatherings in Qom.  Some were reportedly required to sign documents renouncing Sufism. Arrest 
warrants had reportedly been issued for the main Sufi preacher in Qom, Seyed Ahmadi Shariati 
and the four lawyers who had previously been acting on behalf of the group: Amir Eslami, Omid 
Behrouzi, Gholamreza Harsimi and Farshid Yadollahi.  This incident occured amid concerns 
about an increasing demonization of the Sufi Muslim group.  In September 2005, a religious 
jurist in Qom, Ayatollah Hossein Nouri-Hamedani called for a crackdown on Sufi groups in 
Qom. 
 
282. On 14 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights defenders, sent a letter of allegation regarding a <b>peaceful assembly of women&#8217;s rights 
activists in Tehran</b>. According to information received, on 8 March 2006, anti-riot police 
officers, Revolutionary Guards and plainclothes agents surrounded Tehran&#8217;s Daneshjoo Park. 
They ordered hundreds of women and men who had gathered there to celebrate International 
Women&#8217;s Day to disperse. In response, the crowd staged a sit-in and sang the anthem of the 
women&#8217;s rights movement. The security officers then proceeded to dump the contents of garbage 
bins on the women and beat the persons assembled with batons, including poet <b>Simin 
Behbahani</b>, aged over 70. The security forces also arrested foreign journalists and confiscated 
their photographic equipment and video footage before releasing them. The commander of the 
security forces stated that the gathering was held without an official permit and that the security 
forces had to prevent the gathering from taking on a political dimension. On 7 March 2006, the 
Interior Ministry summoned several women&#8217;s rights activists and warned them to cancel the 
gathering planned for 8 March 2006. Concern was expressed, particularly at the use of force by 
the authorities, to bring an end to what was reportedly a peaceful assembly in celebration of an 
internationally commemorated day. Concern was further expressed in light of the information 
that security forces had repeatedly resorted to violence to support peaceful gatherings in the past 
months. 
 
283. On 31 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges 
and lawyers and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning Mr <b>Abdolfattah Soltani</b>, a defence lawyer 
and a founding member of the Defenders of Human Rights Centre (DHRC) who was arrested on 
30 July 2005. Mr Soltani was the subject of two previously sent urgent appeals. According to the </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 107 
 
information received: Mr Soltani had still not been informed of the charges brought against him, 
in violation of paragraph 3 of article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights of which the Islamic Republic of Iran is a Party. It was alleged that on December 3, 2005, 
Mr Sa&#239;d Mortazavi, General Prosecutor of Tehran, decided to replace the investigating judge 
who had just announced to Mr Soltani&#8217;s lawyers that he would recommend his release on bail. 
The newly appointed judge decided, on the same day, that Mr Soltani should remain in custody 
for a further period of three months. Mr Soltani was released on 6 March 2006 on a 100,000 
Euros bail - an unusually high amount which was paid by a solidarity movement. It was reported 
that Mr Soltani would be tried on 5 April 2006 before the Islamic Revolutionary Court of 
Tehran. However, his lawyers had not been granted access to the criminal prosecution file.  
During his detention in solitary confinement in Evin Prison in Tehran, Mr Soltani could only 
meet one of his lawyers in January 2006, more than six months after his arrest. It was also 
alleged that Mr Soltani's prosecution was motivated by his role as a defence lawyer in a case 
where Mr Soltani questioned the role of the Prosecutor in Ms Zahra Kazemi's death in Evin 
prison. Lastly, it was reported that Mr Soltani received an official letter from the Judiciary 
rejecting his election as a Board member of the Tehran Bar Association, on the grounds that his 
candidacy was not valid since he was in prison during the election.  
 
284. On 12 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, 
sent an urgent appeal regarding numerous members of the Kurdish community including <b>Azad 
Rasouli</b>, <b>Abu Bakr Bapiri</b>, <b>Khezer Sa'idnezhad</b>, <b>Mohammad Saleh Kukhashireh</b>, <b>Khaled 
Shirzad</b>, <b>Abu Bakr Tikan Tapeh</b>, <b>Avat Qorayshi</b>, <b>Mohammad Amin Salimian</b>, <b>Sa'adollah 
Soltanian</b>, <b>Khezer Mouloudi</b>, <b>Rezgar Salimian</b>, <b>Dara Qorayshi</b>, <b>Ribvar Salimian</b> and <b>Kamel 
Salimian</b>. On 19 and 20 March 2006, security forces arrested the above-mentioned persons and 
others, possibly numbering more than eighty, from the Kurdish community in Bukan, West 
Azerbaijan Province. The men are former members of Kurdish opposition parties, and had 
previously been arrested a few years ago. They were subsequently released, but kept under 
supervision by the Ministry of Intelligence. They were held at an undisclosed location at the date 
this communication was sent. Their families had not been told where they were or what they had 
been charged with. The security forces also searched their houses and confiscated documents and 
personal computers. Concern was expressed that their arrest was directly linked to their previous 
membership of Kurdish opposition parties.  
 
285. On 8 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, 
sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>Dr.</b> <b>Ramin Jahanbegloo</b>, a philosopher, scholar and author of 
several books on philosophy and modernity in Iran. Reportedly, on 2 May 2006, he was arrested 
at Mehrabad Airport in Tehran after returning from a trip to India. No legal reasons or 
explanations were given for his arrest. Dr. Jahanbegloo, Head of the Department for 
Contemporary Studies at Iran's Cultural Research Bureau, was later taken to Evin prison, where 
he was reportedly kept in incommunicado detention at the date this communication was sent. 
Fears had been expressed that his arrest could be in connection with his academic activities and 
the free expression of his ideas abroad. 
 
286. On 8 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 108 
 
sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>Mostafa Evezpoor</b>, aged 25, <b>Mohammad Reza</b>, aged 14, and 
<b>Morteza</b>, aged 16, brothers and activists for the rights of the Azeri Turk minority in Iran.  
According to the information received, on 6 April 2006, Mohammad Reza was arrested by 
officials from the Ministry of Intelligence, while writing &#8220;I am a Turk and my language is 
Turkish&#8221; on a wall. He was taken to a Ministry of Intelligence facility called Bagh Shomal, 
where he was severely beaten.  He was detained for three days. While he was in detention he was 
suspended by his feet for 24 hours, and given no food or water, or allowed to use a toilet. 
Moreover, on 6 April 2006, Mostafa Evezpoor and Morteza were arrested at about midnight at 
their home in the city of Tabriz, East Azerbaijan province. The arrest was carried out by officials 
from the Ministry of Intelligence.  The officials searched the house and confiscated some Azeri-
Turkish language books, newsletters, posters, CDs, and DVDs of the brothers reportedly at 
nationalist events with other Azeri Turk activists. Furthermore, Mostafa Evezpoor was being 
detained in incommunicado detention at an undisclosed detention facility run by the Ministry of 
Intelligence in Tabriz.  On 9 April 2006, he was brought before a court, although it was unclear 
whether he had been charged with a criminal offence. Morteza was detained for three days.  
 
287. On 22 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
religion or belief and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, sent an urgent appeal 
regarding <b>52 members of the Nematollahi Sufi muslim community</b> and their two lawyers 
<b>Farshad Yadollahi</b> and <b>Omid Behroozi</b>. They are amongst 173 members of the Nematollah 
Sufi Muslim community arrested on 13 February 2006, due to their participation in a peaceful 
protest against an order by the security forces to evacuate the community's place of worship, 
known as Hosseiniye. They were the subject of the communication sent on 1 March 2006, to 
which no response had been received at the date this communication was sent. On 3 May, 52 
members of the Nematollahi Sufi Muslim community and their two lawyers Farshad Yadollahi 
and Omid Behroozi were convicted on charges of &quot;disobeying the orders of government 
officials&quot; and &quot;disturbing public order&quot;. For the former charge, 25 individuals were reportedly 
fined 10 million Iranian Rials (equivalent to more than US$1,000) and the rest were fined 5 
million Iranian Rials (equivalent to more than US$500). For the latter charge, they were 
sentenced to one-year imprisonment and 74 lashes. After their release, they were obliged to 
report to the security officials every month for the period of two years. It was further reported 
that Farshad Yadollahi and Omid Behroozi were disqualified from their profession for five years. 
All of them were released on bail, and were given 20 days to appeal the judgment. 
 
288. On 16 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences and Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning <b>hundreds of women and men who 
participated in the peaceful demonstration</b>, demanding legislative change to ensure equal 
rights in Tehran. According to the information received, hundreds of women and men gathered 
at Haft Tir Square in downtown Tehran on 12 June 2006, and participated in a peaceful 
demonstration in demand for a better recognition of women's rights and to remove 
discriminatory clauses against women from Iran's legal code. It is reported that prior to the 
demonstration, the Judiciary summoned and interrogated numerous women's rights activists. On </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 109 
 
10 June 2006, agents of the Judiciary visited prominent activists at their homes to issue 
summons. Those who were summoned include <b>Noushin Ahmadi Khorasani, Parvin Ardalan, 
Sussan Tahmasebi, Zohreh Arzani </b>and<b> Fariba Davoodi Mohajer</b>. Fariba Davoodi Mohajer 
had been interrogated by judiciary agents of the Revolutionary Court in Tehran for 10 hours. In 
the morning of 12 June, security forces arrested another human rights activist <b>Shahla Entessari</b> 
at her work. On 12 June, before the demonstration started, the security forces started to beat the 
participants with batons, sprayed them with tear gas and color spray, and took them to custody. 
A spokesperson for the judiciary had reportedly confirmed that security forces arrested 70 
people, including 42 women, to prevent the demonstration to take place. Those who were 
arrested at the demonstration site include: <b>Ali</b> <b>Akbar Mousavi Khoiniha</b>, former member of the 
parliament and human rights activist; <b>Jila Baniyaghoub</b>, <b>Delaram Ali, Samira Sadri, Bahareh 
Hedayat, Leila Mohseni, Bahman Ahmadi Amooi, Siamak Taheri</b> and <b>Farahnaz Sharifi</b>. 
According to the spokesperson for the judiciary, they were charged with participation in an 
illegal assembly. 
 
289. On 17 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning Mr <b>Ramin 
Jahanbegloo</b>, journalist and intellectual, who had worked with renowned foreign magazines. Mr 
Jahanbegloo was the subject of a previously sent urgent appeal. According to the information 
received, on 28 April 2006, Ramin Jahanbegloo was arrested at Tehran airport and had since 
been placed in solitary confinement at Evin prison. On 3 July 2006, Intelligence minister 
Gholam Hossein Mohseni Ejeie accused the journalist of taking part in an attempt, namely by 
foreign countries such as the United States of America, to carry out a velvet revolution in Iran.  
A few days later, the appointment of Mr Hassan Hadad, by Tehran General Prosecutor Saeed 
Mortazavi, as deputy prosecutor in charge of tracking &#8220;enemy press&#8221;, raised concern about a new 
wave of arrests among intellectuals and journalists&#8217; circles.  According to reports received, 
several journalists and intellectuals were already detained and charged of offences against state 
security.  
 
290. On 8 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation jointly with the 
Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders concerning Mr <b>Abdolfattah 
Soltani</b>, an Iranian lawyer and a founding member of the Defenders of Human Rights Centre 
(DHRC), who was arrested on 30 July 2005. Mr Soltani was the subject of three previously sent 
urgent appeals. According to the information received, Mr Abdolfattah Soltani was notified on 
16 July 2006 that the Revolutionary Court of Tehran condemned him to a five-year prison term 
and to the loss of his civic rights, for the non-respect of the preliminary investigation 
confidentiality in a politically sensitive case in which he was the defendant&#8217;s lawyer. Mr Soltani 
appealed this decision. Serious concern was expressed that Mr Soltani's prosecution was 
motivated by his plea in a case related to the death of an Iranian-Canadian photographer Ms 
Zahra Kazemi, in Evin prison, where Mr Soltani questioned the fairness of the judicial 
proceedings and the lack of proper investigations including the role of the Tehran Prosecutor in 
such death.  
 
291. On 11 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding the ban of the non-
governmental organization <b><i>Defenders of Human Rights Centre</i> (DHRC), </b>which aims at </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 110 
 
providing legal counsel to dissidents, journalists and students facing prosecution for exercising 
fundamental freedoms and concerning DHRC President, Ms Ebadi, who was the subject of three 
previously sent urgent appeals. According to the information received, on 3 August 2006, the 
Iranian Ministry of Interior declared that the activities of  DHRC were illegal, and that those who 
continued its activities would be prosecuted. Since its creation, DHRC had been repeatedly 
denied legal registration, its requests for registration having been systematically blocked by the 
Iranian authorities without any reasons being provided. Ms Ebadi, was summoned in 2005 by the 
Revolutionary Public Prosecutor&#8217;s office without official reasons, and threatened with arrest and 
prosecution.  
 
292. On 16 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of

Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, an urgent 
appeal regarding the alleged imprisonment of <b>Ahmad Batebi</b>, a student activist, during an 
approved period of leave from prison. Ahmad Batebi was originally detained in 1999 for his 
participation in a student demonstration following the closure of the Newspaper <i>Salam</i>. He had 
been convicted on charges of &#8220;endangering national security&#8221; and condemned to the capital 
punishment by the Islamic Revolutionary Courts. The sentence was later on commuted to 15 
years of imprisonment. The situation of Ahmad Batebi was the subject of two previously sent 
communications. Reportedly, due to his bad health condition and after serving six years of his 
sentence, Ahmad Batebi was granted approved leave by doctors appointed by the judiciary 
system. On 27 July 2006, unknown armed persons conducted a home search, arrested Ahmad 
Batebi and drove him to an undisclosed location, believed to be Evin Prison in Teheran. He was 
reportedly being denied access to his family and lawyer. 
 
293. On 14 September 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning the 
situation of the daily <b><i>Sharq</i></b> . According to the information received, on 10 September 2006, 
<i>Sharq</i> was closed, allegedly after having failed to comply with an order of the Press and 
Supervisory Board to remove Mohammad Rahmanian from his position of Manager Director. On 
10 August 2006, the above-mentioned Board, run by the Ministry of Culture and Islamic 
Guidance, had allegedly sent a letter to the daily <i>Sharq</i> ordering the replacement of Mr 
Rahmanian within one &#8211;month's time. The Board had allegedly accused him of 70 cases of 
violations, including insulting officials, religious and national figures as well as publishing 
blasphemous articles.  Reportedly, the daily <i>Sharq</i> had maintained a critical editorial line and had 
recently criticized the rulings of the Supreme National Security Council. On 12 of August 2006 
the said Press and Supervisory Board ordered the closure of <b><i>Nameh</i></b>  monthly newspaper for 
blasphemy and insulting religious figures. 
 
294. On 22 September 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning Mr 
<b>Mohammad Sadiq Kabudvand</b>, managing editor of the bilingual Kurdish and Farsi weekly

Human Rights. According to the information received, the court of appeals in the northwestern 
city of Sanandaj issued a ruling upholding the one- year prison sentence against Mohammad 
Sadiq Kabudvand. Allegedly, the court also upheld the five-year ban on Mr Kabudvand to 
practice journalism. It had been reported that on 13 September 2006 local authorities in Sanandaj 
had summoned Mr Kabudvand to begin his sentence. On 18 of August 2005, Mr Kabudvand was </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 111 
 
convicted of &quot;inciting the population to rebel against the central state&quot; and creating racial and 
tribal tensions, allegedly in connection with his articles denouncing torture in Iranian jails and 
for his advocacy for a federal system of government for the Islamic Republic of Iran.  He was 
given a one- year suspended prison sentence. 
 
295. On 27 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning the alleged detention of Mr <b>Kianoosh 
Sanjari</b>, member of the United Students Front, who had reported on the human rights situation 
in Iran on online blogs. On 7 October 2006, he was arrested in Tehran after allegedly visiting the 
house of Sh&#8217;ia cleric Ayatollah Sayed Hossein Boroujerdi who had called for the separation of 
religion and state.  The reason for his visit was to write a report about the unrest which had taken 
place between security forces and the supporters of the aforementioned cleric. Mr Sanjari was 
taken to an unknown location and, at the date this communication was sent , he was being held 
incommunicado.. Mr Sanjari had been arrested on a number of occasions in relation to his 
activities and was detained and held in solitary confinement for a number of months in 1999, 
after demonstrating against the closure of the newspaper Salam (Peace). Concern was expressed 
that he was being detained on the basis of his legitimate activities in defence of human rights, in 
particular his reporting on the clashes between the authorities and the supporters of Ayatollah 
Sayed Hossein Boroujerdi. 
 
296. On 13 November 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture 
and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding Mr <b>Abbas Leysanli (or Lisani)</b>, a leading member of 
a national movement in the north-western region of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Mr Leysanli's 
case was the subject of a previously sent urgent appeal. During the mass protests in the city of 
Erdebil in May 2006, Mr Leysanli addressed a crowd of demonstrators and asked for their 
restraint. On 3 June 2006, he was arrested and detained by plainclothes agents of the intelligence 
service. On 27 September 2006, one day before he was released from the Erdebil state prison on 
bail, Mr Leysanli was sentenced to 16 months' imprisonment and fifty lashes in relation to his 
participation in the mass protests on 27 May 2006 in Erdebil. The Court found him guilty of 
&#8220;disturbing the peace, creating public disorder&#8221; and &#8220;participating in the destruction and burning 
of public and private property&#8221;, offences punishable pursuant to Articles 618, 676, 677, 43, 47 
and 727 of the Islamic Penal Law. On 26 October 2006 Mr Leysanli filed a written appeal 
against the sentence of the first instance court. The Erdebil Appeal Court, Branch 1 of the 
Erdebil Province, apparently in closed session, increased the sentence, to 18 months in total and 
retained the fifty lashes. On 31 October 2006, Mr Leysanli was rearrested at his workplace in 
Erdebil by plainclothes security agents and taken to the Erdebil state prison, where he had been 
detained ever since. Mr Leysanli suffered from bad condition of health, reportedly as a result of 
ill-treatment during previous periods of detention. Concern was expressed that his arrest and 
detention may have been connected with Mr Leysanli&#8217;s reportedly peaceful exercise of his right 
to freedom of conscience, opinion, expression and assembly while defending rights of Iranian 
Azeri Turks.  
 
297. On 4 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 112 
 
the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, 
and the Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers sent an urgent appeal 
concerning <b>Mr Mansour Ossanlu</b>, Head of the Union of Workers of the Tehran and Suburbs 
Bus Company. Mr Ossanlu, in detention at Evin Prison at the time this communication was sent, 
was already the subject of an urgent appeal dated 16 January 2006. According to the information 
received, Mr Mansour Ossanlu was arrested at his home by police on 22 December 2005 and 
eventually released on bail amounting to 1.5 billion Rials on 9 August 2006. Mr Ossanlu was 
awaiting trial on charges, the exact nature of which are not known, but which may include 
&#8220;propaganda against the the Islamic Republic&#8221; through leaflets and interviews with foreign anti-
Government radio stations, and &#8220;acting to disturb internal state security by establishing links 
with hostile opposition groups and foreign countries&#8221;. Although he had received a court summon 
ordering him to attend Branch Four of the Special Court for Government Employees on 20 
November 2006, he was re-arrested the day before, 19 November 2006, outside his home by 
plainclothes members of the security forces and detained incommunicado at Evin Prison, Section 
209. He is suffering from a serious eye complaint, but is not receiving medical treatment in 
prison. On 26 November 2006, Mr Ossanlu appeared at Branch 14 of the Revolutionary Court 
for initial investigations by the Prosecutor and no charges were brought against him. Concern is 
expressed that his re-arrest and detention may form a further attempt to deter him from 
peacefully exercising his legitimate right to freedom of association, including the right to form 
and join trade unions, and the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and may also represent 
an attempt by the authorities to prevent him from carrying out his peaceful activities in defence 
of human rights, in particular labour rights.  Further concern is expressed as to his state of health 
and his physical integrity in view of the reported lack of proper medical treatment of his eye 
complaint and also in view of his incommunicado detention.  
 
298. On 15 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning <b>Mr<i> Sherko 
Jihani</i></b> , correspondent of the Turkish news agency Euphrat in Mahabad and a member of the 
Human Rights Organization of Kurdistan (HROK). According to the allegations received, on 27 
November 2006, Mr Jihani was reportedly arrested and detained in Mahabad Central Prison after 
being summoned to appear before Branch 2 of the Revolutionary Prosecutor&#8217;s Office in 
Mahabad. It is reported that Mr Jihani was interrogated about forming an investigative 
committee on the kidnapping on 8 January 2006 of a woman human rights activist, Ms Sarveh 
Komkar (Kamkar), and for giving interviews to foreign media about the killing by Iranian 
security forces of Kurdish activist, Showan (Shivan) Qaderi on 9 July 2005. <b>Mr</b> Qaderi was the 
subject of an allegation letter sent by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions on 10 August 2005. On 30 November, <b>Mr</b> Jihani reportedly went on a 
hunger strike in protest against his detention after refusing to pay a 50 million Rials bail.  On 4 
December, <b>Mr</b> Jihani began refusing to speak. On the same day, his family was reportedly able 
to visit him. On 6 December, <b>Mr</b> Jihani was moved from Mahabad Prison to an unknown 
location, possibly Oromieh prison. On 12 December, <b>Mr</b> Jihani&#8217;s family reportedly received a 
phone call from an alleged member of the Mahabad branch intelligence services who told them 
that <b>Mr</b> Jihani died of a heart attack after falling into a coma. On 13 December, the family was 
relieved to receive a phone call from <b>Mr</b> Jihani, but he was unable to tell them anything about 
his whereabouts. He, however, sounded very weak. <b>Mr</b> Jihani has reportedly been arrested nine 
times since 1999, and is said to have been tortured while previously in detention. Concerns were </p>

expressed that the arrest and detention of <b>Mr</b> Jihani were in relation to his legitimate activities in 
defence of human rights. Further concerns are expressed that <b>Mr</b> Jihani is at risk of torture or ill-
treatment, also in view of the fact that he is reportedly held incommunicado at an unknown 
location.

journalist working for <i>The Associated Press</i> in Iraq, had been allegedly held by United States 
military forces without official charges. Mr Hussein had photographed events in Fallujah and 
Ramadi.  
 
319. On 17 November 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation to the 
Government of Iraq concerning <b><i>Al-Zaura Salah-Eddin and Al Sharkiya TV station </i></b> and  the 
death of journalists from various Media groups. On 5 November 2006, <i>Al-Zaura and Salah-
Eddin TV</i> stations have been closed down allegedly for having incited violence by screening 
footage of protests against former President Saddam Hussein&#8217;s death sentence. In addition, main 
daily newspapers are said to have been suspended for three days, beginning 5 November, under a </p>

curfew decreed prior to the verdict. In a related incident, Baghdad studios of the <i>Al Sharkiya TV 
station</i> were threatened by police to refrain from broadcasting programmes about Saddam&#8217;s trial 
to avoid their closure. On 3 November 2006, <b>Ahmed al Rashid</b>, <i>Al Sharkiya&#8217;s</i> journalist was 
killed in his car as he was leaving the station. On 1 November, the dead body of <b>Abdelmajid 
Isma&#8217;il Khalil</b>, a freelance journalist working for various local newspapers who had been 
abducted on 18 October was found by the police. On 29 of October 2006, <b>Naqshin Hamma

<p>323. On 20 January 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>Hassan 
Mustafa Hassan Zaka</b>, researcher with The Public Committee against Torture in Israel 
(PCATI). PCATI is a non-governmental organization that investigates complaints of human 
rights abuses of Palestinians who claim to have been the victims of torture or other ill-treatments 
and infringements of their human rights by Israeli authorities. Hassan Mustafa Hassan Zaka is 
also employed by the non-governmental organization Ansar Asajeen, which provides legal aid to 
Palestinian detainees and prisoners. According to the information received: On 11 January 2006, 
Hassan Mustafa Hassan Zaka was arrested and detained while attempting to cross a military </p>

checkpoint between Nablus and Tul Karem. He was reported to be detained at the Hawarah 
Military Detention facility near Nablus. On 17 January 2006, the Israeli Defense e Force 
Regional Commander issued a six- month order of administrative detention against Hassan 
Mustafa Hassan Zaka on the grounds of &#8220;endangering the security of the region&#8221;.  
 
324. On 14 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal, jointly with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, concerning 
<b>Ziyad Muhammad Shehadeh Hmeidan</b>, human rights defender and fieldworker for Al-Haq, a 
Palestinian non-governmental organization (NGO), and affiliate organization of the International 
Commission of Jurists which conducts research and advocacy works on human rights. Ziyad 
Muhammad Shehadeh Hmeidan had already been the subject of three previously transmitted 
urgent appeals. According to the new information received: on 12 March 2006, Ziyad 
Muhammad Shehadeh Hmeidan was informed that his administrative detention order was to be 
extended for a further four months. Mr Hmeidan was scheduled to be released on 21 March 
2006. It was also reported that during the 3 January 2006 appeal hearing against the first 
extension of Mr Hmeidan&#8217;s detention order, the military court acknowledged that the public 
evidence against Mr Hmeidan was insufficient to justify his ongoing detention.  
 
325. On 19 May 2006, the Special Rapportuer, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges 
and lawyers and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding Mr <b>Ziyad Muhammad Shehadeh Hmeidan</b>, 
human rights defender and fieldworker for Al-Haq, a Palestinian NGO and affiliate organization 
of the International Commission of Jurists which conducts research and advocacy works on 
human rights. Mr Hmeidan had already been the subject of four previously transmitted 
communications. According to the reply from the Government to a previous communication, 
administrative detention orders are limited to six-month periods and any extensions require re-
evaluation of the relevant intelligence.<b>&#8225;</b> Mr Hmeidan had been in administrative detention since 
23 May 2005 and continued to be held at Kedziot prison. To the date of this communication, 
neither he nor his lawyer had been informed of the reasons for his arrest. It was however noted 
that the Government advised that Mr Hmeidan was &#8220;arrested on suspicion of involvement in 
terrorist activities.&#8221;<b>&#167;</b> It was also noted that the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders visited Mr Hmeidan in prison during her official 
mission to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory in October 2005. According to 
information received, on 10 May 2006 a military judge decided to uphold the third extension of 
Mr Hmeidan&#8217;s administrative detention order. It was reported that Mr Hmeidan&#8217;s detention order 
would expire on 12 July 2006. The  military order of 10 May 2006 represented the third 
extension of his original administrative detention issued on 30 May 2005 which was originally 
for 18 days. It was reported that each extension of the detention orders was done almost at the 
last minute, which caused severe anxiety and anguish to the detainee and their families, 
amounting to psychological torture. Grave concern was expressed that Mr Hmeidan&#8217;s order 
might be subject to indefinite renewal.

326. On 6 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges 
and lawyers and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding Mr <b>Hassan Mustafa Hassan Zaga</b>, a 
researcher who works with the non-governmental organizations the <i>Public Committee Against 
Torture in Israel</i> (PCATI) and <i>Ansar Asajee</i>. PCATI investigates complaints of torture or other 
ill-treatments and infringements of human rights by Israeli authorities and Ansar Asajeen 
provides legal aid to Palestinian detainees and prisoners. Mr Zaka was the subject of a previously 
sent urgent appeal. According to the new information received: on 22 May 2006, the decision to 
extend Mr Zaga's administrative detention order by four months was upheld by the Ketziot 
Military Court. It was reported that the reason given by the General Security Service was that 
Hassan Mustafa Hassan Zaka &quot;endangers the security of the region&quot;. Mr Zaga had not been given 
the opportunity to refute the charges brought against him and he was still being held in Ketziot 
Detention Center.  
 
327. On 18 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning several 
journalists. On 17 July 2006, Mr <b>Walid Al-Omari</b>, <i>Al-Jazeera</i>'s bureau chief in Israel, was 
arrested and detained while covering live the cross-border clashes with Lebanon in northern 
Israel. The journalist was interrogated, and reportedly mistreated, for more than four hours. 
Apparently, police had already arrested and questioned Mr Al-Omari on 16 July, when he spent 
the night in detention. On the same day, Israeli authorities shortly detained another <i>Al-Jazeera</i> 
crew, including journalist <b>Elias Karr am</b>, who was reporting on developments in the city of 
Haifa. Israeli authorities had instructed the <i>Al-Jazeera</i> crew to keep away from strategically 
sensitive sites. On a separate development, on 12 July 2006, reporter <b>Bassel al-Aridi</b>, 
cameraman <b>Abed Khayat</b> and assistant cameraman <b>Ziad Sawan</b>, working for the Lebanese 
television channel <i>New TV</i>, were seriously wounded during the attack against the al-
Mahmoudiyeh Bridge in southern Lebanon, when their vehicle was hit and destroyed by bombs  
 
328. On 25 July, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning <b>Layal, Nagib </b>a 
Lebanese press photographer<b>, Sleiman Chidia </b>a technician for the <i>TV station Lebanese 
Broadcasting Corporation (LBC)</i>, <b>Faten Elwan</b>, a correspondent for the television station Al-
Hurra<b> </b>and<b> Wael Tanous </b>a satellite technician with the TV channel <i>Al-Jazeera</i>. On 23 July 2006, 
<b>Layal Nagib</b> was killed when a missile exploded near her car on the road between Cana et 
Siddiqin, while covering the bombing of southern Lebanon for the magazine <i>Al Jarass (The 
Bell)</i>. On the same day, <b>Sleiman Chidia</b> was killed in the bombing of media installations in 
Satka, in East Beirut. Other air strikes at Terbol, in northern Lebanon, resulted in the disruption 
of broadcasting of LBC, Avenir TV and Al-Manar in several parts of the country. In a separate 
incident, on 19 July 2006, <b>Faten Elwan</b>, and <b>Wael Tanous</b> were wounded during an Israeli army 
operation in the city of Nablus, West Gaza. Reportedly, both Elwan and Tanous were wearing a 
vest labeled &quot;TV&quot; and were working from a remarkable distance from the fighting. 
 
329. On 21 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
Human Rights and counter terrorism, sent a letter of allegation concerning Mr <b>Aziz Dweik</b>, 
Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council. According to the information received, Mr 
Dweik, an academic aged 57 and member of Hamas, was elected Speaker of the Palestinian 
Legislative Council after the most recent elections. On 5 August 2006, Israeli Defense Forces </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 121 
 
(IDF) surrounded Mr Dweik's house in Ramallah and took him into custody. From there he was 
taken to Ofer prison. On or around 10 August 2006, a court in Ofer decided to extend Mr 
Dweik's detention, for further eight days. In these proceedings he had the assistance of a lawyer. 
He was then transferred to the Kfar Youna detention centre. IDF has confirmed the detention of 
Mr Dweik, stating that it was justified by Hamas being listed as a terrorist organization. Mr 
Dweik remains in IDF detention. Israeli forces had already, on 29 June 2006, arrested eight 
members of the Palestinian Authority's government and 20 or more members of the Palestinian 
Legislative Council.  
 
330. On 4 September 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning 
reporter <b>Sabbah Hmaida</b>, who was seriously injured in the leg and <b>Fadel Shana</b>, cameraman, 
who lost consciousness when an Israeli aircraft fired two missiles on their armored Reuters 
vehicle as they were following an Israeli Defense Forces incursion into the Gaza Strip on 27 of 
August 2006. Reportedly the vehicle was clearly marked with press identification signs on the 
roof and sides. The Special Rapporteur noted that similar incidents have been subject of previous 
communications sent on 25 July 2006 (ISR 15/2006) and 18 July 2006 (ISR 14/2006). 
 
331. On 25 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the with the Chairperson-
Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegation concerning the detention of 
<b>Mr Ahmad Abu Haniya</b>, a Palestinian human rights activist and Youth Project Coordinator in 
the Alternative Information Centre. This Centre is a joint Palestinian-Israeli organisation based 
in Jerusalem which promotes human rights and advocates social change in the region. 
Reportedly, on 22 May 2005, <b>Mr</b> Haniya was arrested at an Israeli military checkpoint on his 
way to work. He was subsequently detained under an administrative detention order and has 
been accused of membership of the Palestinian Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PLFP) and 
of a group called Al-Islamia. He was reported to be detained at Ketziot detention centre in the 
Negev. The administrative detention order against him was renewed twice since he was first 
detained. Under the terms of an administrative detention order, the authorities are neither 
required to file charges against the detainee nor to bring the case to trial.  The order is usually for 
a determined period of time but is often renewed before it expires and it can be renewed 
indefinitely. Neither the defendant nor his legal representative are entitled to view the 
&quot;classified&quot; evidence against the defendant. The current order is due to expire on 15 November 
2006, but it is feared that it may be renewed. Concern is expressed that <b>Mr</b> Ahmad Abu Haniya 
may be detained in order to prevent him from carrying out peaceful activities in defence of 
human rights. 
 
<b>Replies from the Government 
 
</b>332. By letter dated 7 August 2006, the Government replied to the communication of 18 July 
2006 concerning several journalists. The Government of Israel explained that on the night of 16 
July 2006, the police questioned <b>Mr</b> <b>Al-Omari</b> but did not arrest him or detainhim for 
interrogation. He was released after half an hour and did not spend the night in detention neither 
was mistreated. It was also indicated that the next morning, on 17 July 2006, <b>Mr</b> Al-Omari was 
again convoked for questioning by the police for violation of the censorships instructions. The 
Government reported that <b>Mr</b> Al-Omari was broadcasting live from the sites where the missiles </p>

page 122 
 
hit, thereby violating the instructions published the day before by the censorship. During the 
whole period of questioning, <b>Mr</b> Al-Omari was accompanied by the lawyer of Al-Jazeera 
network. The Government informed that he was released after checking the footage he had taken 
did not infringe censorship instructions. As to <b>Mr</b> Elias Karram, the Government indicated in 
this response that the police had questioned him on 16 July 2006, the first day when the city of 
Haifa was targeted. The reason for the questioning was the wide-angle picture that <b>Mr</b> Karram 
had taken of the city of Haifa, giving the enemy a panoramic view of the sites where the missiles 
hit. The Government informed that he was released after two hours.

September 2005, whilst the State of Israel was in control of the border passages, Mr Shammala&#8217;s 
exit from the Gaza Strip was prevented for security reasons following intelligence gathered by 
the Security forces which indicated that Mr Shammala posed a security threat if allowed to leave 
the country. The Government indicated, that in accordance with the declaration signed by the 
Commander of the IDF Southern Command Unit on 12 September 2006, which confirmed the 
end of Israels military rule in the Gaza Strip, Mr Shammala&#8217;s movements from the Gaza Strip to 
Egypt were no longer under Israeli military control.  
 
335. By letter dated 19 January 2006, the Government of Israel responded to the urgent appeal

338. On 30 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning the 
journalists, <b>Cristina Zagaria, Claudio Ern&#232; </b>and the<b> </b>newspaper<b> &#8220;La Repubblica&#8221;.</b> According 
to the information received, on 11 August 2006, the Milan and Rome offices of the newspaper 
<b>&#8220;La Repubblica&#8221;</b> were searched, on the orders of the Brescia city prosecutor, as part of an 
investigation into the alleged kidnapping of the imam Abu Omar, in February 2002, by the 
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). It has been reported that the office and the house of Ms 
Zagaria were searched with particular thoroughness, notes and papers confiscated, and 
documents in her computer copied. In addition, the computer of the journalist Carlo Bonini, who 
is involved in the main judicial enquiry on the kidnapping of the imam, was allegedly seized. On 
the night of 11 August 2006, also the offices of the newspaper &quot;Il Piccolo&quot; in Trieste and the 
home of one of its journalist Claudio Ern&#232;, were meticulously combed. Ms Zagaria and Mr Ern&#232; 
have been accused of violating legal confidentiality rules and handling secret documents under 
article 648 of the Criminal Code as part of a lawsuit, because they quoted in their newspaper 
remarks that the Chief of the Italian Military Intelligence in the district of Trieste made during an 
interrogation about the kidnapping. 
 
<b>Replies from the Government 
 
</b>339. By letter dated 15 November 2006, the Government of Italy replied to the communication 
of 30 August 2006 concerning journalists Cristina <b>Zagaria, Claudio Ern&#232; </b>and the<b> </b>newspaper<b> 
&#8220;La Repubblica.&#8221;</b> The Government of Italy informed that the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office at the 
Tribunal in Brescia clarified that the searches of the newspapers were carried out within the 
framework of a criminal proceeding, initiated on 17 July 2006 further to the filing of a 
complaint. The complaint related to the issuance by media of the contents of the transcript 
concerning the examination of an indicted person who was involved in the criminal proceeding 
relating to the so-called &#8220;Abu Omar case&#8221;. The Government indicated that the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office at the Tribunal in Brescia underlined that no specific search of the premises 
of the Italian newspapers: &#8220;La Repubblica&#8221; and &#8220;Il Piccolo di Trieste&#8221; had taken place. However, 
specific searches were carried out on some notebooks and office desks, in addition to a specific 
search on the email server and on the in-and out-bound fax tabulations. The Government of Italy 
stressed that article 14 of the Italian Constitution, recognising the inviolability of personal 
domicile was fully respected.

</b>341. On 14 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning the 
<b>Zhumash-Kokberi</b> company, owners of the <i>Juma Times</i> newspaper. According to information 
received, on 6 March 2006 the Specialised Economic Inter-District Court of Almaty ordered the 
closure of Zhumash-Kokberi company and the cancellation of Juma Times&#8217; registration. This 
sentence was based on article 100 of the Election Campaigning Rules concerning the publishing 
of falsehoods about the President in an attempt to affect the outcome of the presidential elections. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 124 
 
The charges were based on a number of articles published by Juma Times which were found by 
the court to be insulting to the honour and dignity of the President who was running for re-
elections. Juma Times had declared itself the successor of the opposition paper Soldat which was 
shut down in 2003; Soldat was itself the successor of <i>Dat</i> newspaper which had gone bankrupt 
after having been sued for libel. 
 
342. On 14 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning <b>Gulzhan 
Yergaliyeva</b>, editor in chief of <i>Svoboda Slova</i> newspaper and member of the <i>For A Fair 
Kazakhstan bloc</i>. According to information received, on 1 March 2006 Ms Yergaliyeva was fined 
approximately US$ 316 for holding an unauthorized demonstration on 26 February 2006 to pay 
final respects to victims of political repression following the killing of the former Information 
Minister and leader of the opposition party Ak Zhol, Altynbek Sarsenbayev. On 2 March 2006, 
this sentence was reviewed as the prosecutor deemed the sentence handed down on 1 March 
2006 as light, and he was then sentenced to five days' administrative detention. She went on a 
hunger strike in protest and another member of the For A Fair Kazakhstan bloc, <b>Marzhan 
Aspandiyarova</b>, joined the hunger strike. She was also sentenced to ten days of administrative 
arrest.  
 
<b>Replies from the Government 
</b> 
343. By letter 1 of May 2006, the Government replied to communication of 14 March 2006. On 
9 December 2005, the Auezov district procurator in Almaty brought an action with the Almaty 
special inter-district economic court for the closure of the company which owns the <b>newspaper 
<i>Juma Times</i></b> , the J&#251;mash K&#246;kb&#246;ri limited partnership, and to halt publication of the newspaper. 
In pursuance of that action, and on the application of the petitioner, the court placed a ban on the 
publication of Juma Times by its rulings of 20 December 2005 and barred its alienation (transfer 
of ownership) to other persons until such time as the dispute had been considered on its merits. It 
was reported that the action for the closure of J&#251;mash K&#246;kb&#246;ri was brought in response to its 
repeated and flagrant violations of the stipulations of Kazakh law (article 49, paragraph 2.4, of 
the Civil Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan) committed in the course of publishing the 
newspaper Juma Times. In particular, on two occasions, by decisions of the Almaty special inter-
district administrative court dated 21 October and 4 November 2005 relating to the dissemination 
in issues 41 and 44 of Juma Times of knowingly false information about N. Nazarbaev, 
candidate for the post of President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, with the aim of influencing the 
outcome of the elections, administrative charges were brought against the company J&#251;mash 
K&#246;kb&#246;ri under article 100 of the Kazakh Code of Administrative Offences and it was fined 14 
monthly notional units (46,608 tenge). The Government stated that, during the election period, 
J&#251;mash K&#246;kb&#246;ri failed to observe the requirements of article 28, paragraph 5, of the Kazakh 
Constitutional Act on Elections in the Republic of Kazakhstan, stipulating that, during the period 
of elections, printed campaign materials must contain information about the organization 
responsible for the publication of such materials, the place where they are printed, the size of the 
print-run, the persons commissioning their publication and the funds used to pay for them. It was 
noted that publications by the newspaper Juma Times, which were campaign materials, 
contained no information about the persons who had commissioned them or the funds used to 
pay for their publication. In addition, by publishing an article containing the results of opinion 
polls without including the required information the company J&#251;mash K&#246;kb&#246;ri violated the 
provisions of article 28, paragraph 9, of the Constitutional Act on Elections. It was further </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 125 
 
reported that article 27, paragraph 7, of the Constitutional Act on Elections stipulates that the 
media must refrain from publishing campaign materials and other information which knowingly 
impugn the honour, dignity and good standing of candidates. In breach of those stipulations, 
J&#251;mash K&#246;kb&#246;ri published some articles. The Government explained that other violations by 
J&#251;mash K&#246;kb&#246;ri of the requirements of law were also attested; in particular, for breaching the tax 
regulations by failing to submit its tax returns on time during the third quarter of 2004, 
administrative charges were laid against J&#251;mash K&#246;kb&#246;ri by decision dated 14 December 2004 
of the Auezov district tax committee in Almaty, under article 206, paragraph 1, of the 
Kazakhstan Code of Administrative Offences, and the company was fined 18,380 tenge. 
Following its consideration of the action brought by the Auezov district procurator in Almaty, on 
6 March 2006 the Almaty special inter-district economic court handed down a judgement 
ordering the closure of the company that owns Juma Times, the limited partnership J&#251;mash 
K&#246;kb&#246;ri, and halting the newspaper&#8217;s publication, in response to its violations of the elections 
law and its failure to comply with the tax regulations. No appeal was lodged against the court&#8217;s 
judgement, which entered into force on 23 March 2006. In view of that situation, the information 
and archives committee of the Kazakhstan Ministry of Culture and Information, acting pursuant 
to article 13, paragraph 5, of the Kazakh Media Act, is currently examining the issue of 
cancelling the registration of the newspaper Juma Times. The administrative sanctions imposed 
on the editor-in-chief of the newspaper <b>Svoboda Slova, G. Ergalieva</b>, and the member of the 
Kazakh voluntary association Democratic Forces Coalition for a Just Kazakhstan, <b>M. 
Aleksandrova</b>, were ordered in response to violations of the Peaceful Assemblies, Rallies, 
Marches, Pickets and Demonstrations. It was noted that under article 5 of the Rallies Act, such 
measures may only be held in accordance with the purposes specified in the application, within 
the specified time period and at the agreed venue. In the conduct of such measures, the 
organizers and other persons involved are obliged to observe the laws and not to disturb public 
order. Those provisions notwithstanding, and in disregard of the interpretation of the law 
provided on 24 February 2006 by the Almaty procurator&#8217;s office, in their organization and 
conduct of the public activities devoted to the Day to Commemorate Victims of Political Terror, 
G. Ergalieva and M. Aleksandrova, together with other leaders of the Democratic Forces 
Coalition for a Just Kazakhstan, flagrantly violated the provisions of the article cited above. 
Permission had been granted by the Almaty city akimat for the activities in question to be held 
on 26 February 2006 in the square behind the Ary-Arka cinema. Yet the activities were 
conducted by the persons named above on 26 February 2006 in Valikhanov Square in Almaty - 
in other words, at a venue that had not been sanctioned by the local authorities. In addition, the 
organizers rallied local citizens to attend the activities in Valikhanov Square through 
announcements in the periodical publications Svoboda Slova and Aina Plyus, thereby 
deliberately flouting the provisions of article 5 of the Rallies Act. Given that situation, by its 
decisions of 28 February 2006, the Almaty special inter district administrative court found M. 
Aleksandrova and G. Ergalieva guilty of the administrative offence described in article 373, 
paragraph 3, of the Kazakhstan Code of Administrative Offences. M. Aleksandrova was ordered 
to serve a penalty of 10 days&#8217; administrative detention and G. Ergalieva received an 
administrative fine of 40 monthly notional units. Following an objection by the Almaty 
procurator&#8217;s office, the court&#8217;s decision regarding G. Ergalieva was overturned by a ruling of the 
Almaty City Court of 2 March 2006 and she was ordered to serve a penalty of five days&#8217; 
administrative detention. By rulings of the Almaty City Court of 3 and 4 March 2006, the 
penalties imposed on G. Ergalieva and M. Aleksandrova in the form of administrative detention </p>

were approved without change and their appeals were dismissed. G. Ergalieva and M. 
Aleksandrova have by now served their administrative detention penalties. 
 
<b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b> 
344. By letter dated 19 January 2006, the Government of Kazakhstan replied to the 
communication of 15 November 2005 concerning alleged &#8220;violations&#8221; of the rights of journalists 
during the pre-election period and also in connection with the death of <b>Kamanbek Nurkadilov</b>. 
It was reported that Kaziz Toguzbaev was found guilty of an administrative violation under 
article 373, paragraph 3 of the Code of Administrative Offences of Kazakhstan. He was 
sentenced to administrative arrest for a period of five days. The case was not appealed , and Mr 
Toguzbaev did not submit any petitions to higher courts for verification of the legality of the 
court&#8217;s decision. Mr Toguzbaev was prosecuted for an administrative offence that did not 
involve his journalistic activities but rather the organization and participation in an unauthorized 
procession that violated the public order. The Government stated that the record of the 
administrative offence of 11 October 2005 indicated that Mr Toguzbaev took part in a procession 
of some 50 citizens in Almaty on 10 October 2005, who disrupted the traffic and damaged 
planted areas. Mr Toguzbaev declined the legal assistance of counsel and requested that he be 
given the maximum length of administrative arrest. The Government noted that the 
administrative penalty was consistent with the sanctions. Mr Toguzbaev began a dry hunger 
strike to protest against injustice. It was reported that Mr Toguzbaev refused to sign the record or 
to give written explanations of the hunger strike. The Government noted that this case had been 
closed. Pursuant to a decision of the Almaty special interdistrict administrative court on 21 
October 2005, the owner of the newspaper Svoboda Slova was found guilty of an offence under 
article 100 of the Code of Administrative Offences and was ordered to pay a fine. The court 
ordered the confiscation and destruction of issue No.33 of this newspaper, which was used in the 
commission of the offence and which belongs to the owner of the newspaper. It was reported that 
on 2 November 2005, the Almaty city court upheld the decision and rejected the complaint and 
that a report was drawn up concerning the administrative offence committed by the newspaper 
on grounds of disseminating knowingly false information about candidates and political parties. 
The Government confirmed that no procedural violations were committed in the institution of 
administrative proceedings or in the court&#8217;s consideration of the case. It was reported that the 
case had been closed. On the other hand, by ruling of 17 November 2005, the Almaty city court 
upheld the decision of the Almaty special interdistrict administrative court of 21 October 2005, 
in which the Jumash-Kokbori Company, which owns the <b>newspaper <i>Juma Times</i></b> , was 
convicted pursuant to article 100 of the Code of Aministrative Offences and was fined. On 14 
October 2005, a report was drawn up on the administrative offence committed by the Jumash-
Kokbori Company, which published articles where, although there was no evidence of a crime 
committed, the acts insulted the honour and dignity of a candidate for President of the Republic 
of Kazakhstan. These acts, according to the Government&#8217;s information, were qualified under 
article 100 of the Code of Administrative Offences and the administrative penalty was consistent 
with the sanctions. The Government stated that this case had been closed. With reference to the 
activities of the <b>newspaper <i>Altyn Gasyr</i></b> , on 15 September 2005, Ms Taizhanova came to the 
duty unit of the Atyrau internal affairs office and requested that measures be taken against 
unidentified individuals who had beaten her son, <b>Azamat Bolatovich Dospanov</b>, and her 
nephew, <b>Mr Abilkaliev</b> , the editor-in-chief of the newspaper. It was reported in the 
investigation that on 14 September 2005, <b>B. Lukpanov, E. Shanenov, R. Shukatirov</b> and an </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 127 
 
unidentified individual beat Azamat Bolatovich Dospanov, who had to be taken to the hospital as 
a result of the injuries. On 28 September 2005 authorities instituted criminal proceedings on the 
basis of an offence contrary to article 257, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code of Kazakhstan. On 
27 September 2005 material concerning a publication in the newspaper describing the beating 
was registered in the Atyrau department of internal affairs. Despite the fact that a decision was 
taken not to institute criminal proceedings on 28 September 2005, on 26 October 2005 the Ayrau 
procurator&#8217;s office overturned that decision and materials went sent for further investigations. It 
was noted that <b>Mr Abilkaliev</b> had not reported his beating to the law enforcement authorities 
and that he refused to undergo a forensic examination. Criminal proceedings were not instituted 
in this case. The Government indicated that the investigation of the criminal proceedings 
instituted pursuant to the assault on Azamat Dospanov revealed that the aforementioned 
incidents were not related to the activities of the newspaper <i>Altyn Gasyr</i>. Concerning the 
investigation into the death of <b>Zamanbek Nurkadilov</b>, the Government stated that on 12 
November 2005 his death body was found at his home together with a revolver belonging to him. 
It was established that Mr Nurkadilov and his wife had been living apart in two houses situated 
on the same parcel of land. The territory of the estate was monitored by several video cameras. 
Relatives were questioned and they stated that Mr Nurkadilov led a solitary life and did not 
receive any strangers. The Government provided with detailed activities of Mr Nurkadilov habits 
and the events of the night of the killing. It was reported that forensic examinations conducted 
revealed that Mr Nurkadilov died from several shots causing wounds, which confirm by the 
nature and location of them that they were consequence of a gun fired by the victim himself. It 
was established that already in September 2005 Mr Nurkadilov had tried to commit suicide with 
a large dose of sleeping pills. The Government noted that investigations into the case are 
continuing.

346. On 18 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegation 
concerning <b>Ms Aziza Abdurasulova</b>, head of the non- governmental organization Kylym 
Shamy, an organization that monitors human rights violations in Kyrgyzstan. According to the 
information received, on 19 April 2006 Ms Aziza Abdurasulova had appeared on a television 
programme where she asked the President of Kyrgyzstan a number of questions. On 20 April 
2006, Ms Abdurasulova was visited by an unknown man who asked her questions regarding the 
financing of her organization. On 25 April 2006 Ms Abdurasulova was visited by Kyrgyz 
security personnel who asked her questions relating to Kylym Shamy. It is reported that she was 
asked questions concerning the finances of the organization and who was &#8220;the leader of their 
party&#8221;. Concern is expressed that the above events are related to the activities of Ms 
Abdurasulova in defence of human rights and may be an attempt to intimidate and prevent her 
from carrying out her legitimate activities in defence of human rights.

Suivi des communications pr&#233;c&#233;demment transmises  
 
</b>349. Le 6 avril 2006, le Gouvernement a r&#233;pondu &#224; une lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation envoy&#233; par le 
Rapporteur sp&#233;cial en date 14 d&#233;cembre 2005 sur l&#8217;assassinat du journaliste et d&#233;put&#233; <b>Gebran 
Tueni</b>. Avant de r&#233;pondre aux questions pos&#233;es et aux demandes formul&#233;es, le Minist&#232;re libanais 
de la justice a souhait&#233; apporter les &#233;claircissements suivants:<b> </b>L&#8217;&#201;tat libanais, en tant que 
Membre fondateur et actif de l&#8217;Organisation des Nations Unies, est li&#233; par les instruments 
internationaux adopt&#233;s par cette derni&#232;re, et notamment la D&#233;claration universelle des droits de 
l&#8217;homme. La Constitution libanaise du 23 mai 1926, telle que modifi&#233;e par la loi 
constitutionnelle n. 18 du 21 septembre 1990, a consacr&#233; ce principe, notamment au paragraphe 
b) de son pr&#233;ambule. En outre, le Liban applique l&#8217;ensemble des conventions et des pactes 
internationaux qu&#8217;il a ratifi&#233;s, en particulier le Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et 
politiques et le Pacte international relatif aux droits &#233;conomiques, sociaux et culturels. D&#8217;ailleurs, 
la l&#233;gislation libanaise accorde &#224; ces instruments la primaut&#233; sur toutes les lois nationales.<b> </b>Le 
droit &#224; la libert&#233; d&#8217;opinion et d&#8217;expression fait partie des droits fondamentaux au Liban. Il s&#8217;agit 
en effet de l&#8217;un des principaux droits inscrits dans la Constitution. L&#8217;alin&#233;a <i>c</i> du pr&#233;ambule de 
celle ci stipule ce qui suit: &#171; Le Liban est une r&#233;publique d&#233;mocratique parlementaire, fond&#233;e sur 
le respect des libert&#233;s publiques et, en premier lieu, la libert&#233; d&#8217;opinion et de croyance&#8230; &#187;. Ce 
droit est &#233;galement consacr&#233; &#224; l&#8217;article 13 de la Constitution, qui est libell&#233; comme suit: &#171; La 
libert&#233; d&#8217;exprimer sa pens&#233;e par la parole ou par la plume, la libert&#233; de la presse, la libert&#233; de 
r&#233;union et la libert&#233; d&#8217;association sont &#233;galement garanties dans les limites fix&#233;es par la loi. &#187;. En 
cons&#233;quence, le droit &#224; la libert&#233; d&#8217;opinion et d&#8217;expression est un droit sacr&#233;, que l&#8217;&#201;tat libanais 
s&#8217;efforce de renforcer et de prot&#233;ger par tous les moyens disponibles.<b> </b>L&#8217;assassinat du d&#233;put&#233; 
Gebran Tueni constitue non seulement une atteinte &#224; la libert&#233; d&#8217;expression, mais aussi un crime 
terroriste s&#8217;inscrivant dans le cadre de toute une s&#233;rie d&#8217;agressions, d&#8217;attentats &#224; la bombe et de 
meurtres dont est victime le Liban depuis environ une ann&#233;e, qui visent &#224; terroriser tous les 
Libanais, et pas seulement les journalistes. L&#8217;&#201;tat libanais s&#8217;est clairement et ouvertement 
engag&#233; &#224; combattre le terrorisme par tous les moyens en sa possession, &#224; retrouver les auteurs de 
ce crime et &#224; les traduire en justice.<b> </b>Deuxi&#232;mement, en r&#233;ponse &#224; la demande du Rapporteur 
sp&#233;cial tendant &#224; ce que des enqu&#234;tes soient diligent&#233;es sur les violations perp&#233;tr&#233;es, &#224; ce que les </p>

</b>Le Minist&#232;re de la justice a obtenu des autorit&#233;s judiciaires comp&#233;tentes charg&#233;es de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te 
les renseignements suivants. Pour ce qui est de diligenter des enqu&#234;tes sur les violations 
commises, il y a lieu de souligner que, d&#232;s que l&#8217;attentat s&#8217;est produit, les services de s&#233;curit&#233; ont 
&#233;tabli un cordon de s&#233;curit&#233; autour du secteur o&#249; il a eu lieu et proc&#233;d&#233; aux investigations

demand&#233;es par le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, il convient de signaler que l&#8217;&#201;tat libanais a pris plusieurs 
dispositions dont voici les plus importantes: le renforcement des mesures de s&#233;curit&#233; dans toutes 
les r&#233;gions du Liban;<b> </b>la mise en place d&#8217;une cellule sp&#233;ciale au Minist&#232;re de la d&#233;fense, dirig&#233;e 
par un officier sup&#233;rieur de l&#8217;arm&#233;e et compos&#233;e d&#8217;officiers des diff&#233;rents services de s&#233;curit&#233; 
aux fins d&#8217;adopter les d&#233;cisions et les directives requises en vue de faire face &#224; tout nouvel acte 
de terrorisme; l&#8217;organisation du d&#233;placement des membres des services de s&#233;curit&#233; vers l&#8217;endroit 
o&#249; a &#233;t&#233; commis le crime, recherche d&#8217;indices et transfert du dossier de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te au premier juge 
d&#8217;instruction militaire; la stricte surveillance du lieu du crime afin d&#8217;&#233;viter que des indices soient 
d&#233;truits; l&#8217;organisation d&#8217;exercices pour tous les services de s&#233;curit&#233; en coop&#233;ration avec les 
autorit&#233;s judiciaires comp&#233;tentes afin d&#8217;apprendre aux membres de ces services ainsi qu&#8217;aux 
officiers et aux juges comp&#233;tents &#224; faire face aux attentats et agressions r&#233;p&#233;t&#233;s et &#224; appliquer de 
fa&#231;on rationnelle les directives &#233;manant de la cellule sp&#233;ciale. Le plus important de ces 
exercices, effectu&#233; au mois de juin pass&#233; dans la r&#233;gion de Nahr al Mawt, a donn&#233; des r&#233;sultats 
extr&#234;mement satisfaisants et permis de savoir dans quelle mesure les forces de s&#233;curit&#233; &#233;taient 
pr&#234;tes &#224; faire face aux attentats. La restructuration des institutions et des services de s&#233;curit&#233; pour 
leur permettre de s&#8217;acquitter pleinement de leurs fonctions a &#233;t&#233; une autre disposition prise.<b> 
</b>Troisi&#232;mement, en r&#233;ponse aux questions du Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur certains faits qu&#8217;il a &#233;voqu&#233;s 
dans sa lettre et au sujet des enqu&#234;tes judiciaires et des r&#233;sultats auxquels elles ont abouti, il 
convient avant de se pencher sur les faits en question et l&#8217;enqu&#234;te judiciaire de rappeler le 
principe fondamental qu&#8217;est la n&#233;cessit&#233; de pr&#233;server le secret de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te. Au Liban la 
violation de ce secret constitue une infraction p&#233;nale punie par la loi. Le l&#233;gislateur libanais a 
plac&#233; les activit&#233;s de la justice sous le sceau du secret pour permettre au juge d&#8217;instruction 
d&#8217;op&#233;rer en toute libert&#233; et autonomie, &#224; l&#8217;abri des pressions que peut exercer sur lui l&#8217;opinion 
publique, et pour &#233;viter au pr&#233;venu toute publicit&#233; qui pourrait nuire &#224; sa cause, surtout si les 
accusations sont abandonn&#233;es par la suite.  Le principe du secret de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te est consacr&#233; aux 
articles 53 et 42 du nouveau Code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale en date du 7 ao&#251;t 2001. L&#8217;article 53 
stipule que l&#8217;enqu&#234;te reste secr&#232;te tant que l&#8217;affaire n&#8217;a pas &#233;t&#233; renvoy&#233;e devant le tribunal et 
punit quiconque divulgue le secret de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te. Quant &#224; l&#8217;article 42, il oblige le fonctionnaire 
judiciaire charg&#233; de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te &#224; mener la proc&#233;dure dans le secret le plus total.  Dans cette 
optique, apr&#232;s avoir consult&#233; l&#8217;autorit&#233; judiciaire charg&#233;e de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te, le Minist&#232;re de la justice 
s&#8217;est pench&#233; sur les faits et les mesures judiciaires g&#233;n&#233;rales qui ne sont pas de nature &#224; porter 
atteinte au secret de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te, laissant au juge d&#8217;instruction comp&#233;tent toute la libert&#233; de prendre 
la d&#233;cision voulue, sachant que la d&#233;cision que prendra le premier juge d&#8217;instruction militaire, 
Rachid Mezher r&#233;pondra pleinement aux questions du Rapporteur sp&#233;cial.<b> </b>Concernant les 
pr&#233;cisions au sujet des faits mentionn&#233;s dans le r&#233;sum&#233; du Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, selon les 
informations obtenues aupr&#232;s du tribunal comp&#233;tent, l&#8217;assassinat a &#233;t&#233; commis le 12 d&#233;cembre 
2005 vers 9 heures du matin &#224; Mkalles au moyen d&#8217;une voiture pi&#233;g&#233;e. Cet attentat visait le 
d&#233;put&#233; Gebran Tueni qui &#233;tait &#233;galement un journaliste connu et le propri&#233;taire du journal <i>Al

&#233;t&#233; bless&#233;es.  Pour ce qui est de la question de savoir si M. Gebran Tueni a re&#231;u ou non des 
menaces de mort, nous estimons que conform&#233;ment au principe de l&#8217;ind&#233;pendance de la justice 
et pour ne pas porter atteinte au secret de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te, il faut laisser le soin de trancher aux 
tribunaux qui disposeront de tous les &#233;l&#233;ments n&#233;cessaires pour le faire, et eu &#233;gard aussi au fait 
que de telles menaces constitueraient, le cas &#233;ch&#233;ant, un mobile pour la commission du crime et, 
partant, un &#233;l&#233;ment constitutif de celui ci. Concernant les renseignements pouvant &#234;tre fournis au

conducteur de la BMW qui avait permis au conducteur de la voiture pi&#233;g&#233;e de quitter les lieux 
quelques minutes avant l&#8217;explosion. Le 20 d&#233;cembre 2005, le juge d&#8217;instruction a convoqu&#233; une

les lieux du crime et sur la fa&#231;on de travailler des services de s&#233;curit&#233; libanais en comparaison 
avec ceux de leur pays; les experts &#233;taient tr&#232;s satisfaits de la mani&#232;re dont l&#8217;enqu&#234;te &#233;tait 
conduite. La route sur laquelle a eu lieu l&#8217;attentat a &#233;t&#233; ouverte au public apr&#232;s que les experts 
hollandais ont conclu que tous les indices qui se trouvaient sur les lieux avaient &#233;t&#233; recueillis.

<p>351. On 3 February 2006, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Independent Expert on 
Minority Issues, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms of indigenous sent a letter of allegation concerning information 
received regarding <b>discrimination toward Berbers</b>, particularly on the existence of 
discriminatory legislations toward the Berber culture and identity, such as the law number 24 of 
the year 1369 w.r. (1991). Reportedly, the said laws prevent people from using any other 
language than Arabic in the country and also forbid literature and writings which is not in Arabic, 
and therefore, the use of the Berber language. It is also alleged that it is forbidden to use names 
of Berber origin to name children. It has been also alleged that the Libyan government 
deliberately withholds the development of regions with Berber communities. As an example, the 
only hospital in the region of Zouara, which was closed in the 1980&#8217;s, has not been reopened and 
that there is no hospital in the region. Similarly, it has been alleged that the water projects in the 
country have deliberately excluded the regions of Nefoussa and Zouara. The information also 
alledged that the Libyan education system and school books do not take into account the Berber 
component in Libya&#8217;s geography, history and culture. Allegations also report the harassment and 
ill-treatment of persons working for the defence of the Berber community, culture and identity. 
 
<b>Observations 
</b> 
352. At the time this report was finalized, the Special Rapporteur had not received any reply to 
the communication dated 3 February 2006.  The Special Rapporteur invites the Government to 
respond to this communication.<b>  
</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Malaysia 
</b> 
353. On 18 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur and the Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
religion or belief sent a letter of allegation concerning the alleged facts that during the last 
month, the Internal Security Ministry of Malaysia has <b>banned eighteen books</b>, mainly devoted 
to the study of inter-religious matters, on the grounds that they could have 'disrupted peace and 
harmony'. Twelve of these books were printed in English and the rest in Malay. The books had 
been banned under the Printing Presses and Publications Act 1984 section 9(1), by which the 
Internal Security Ministry of Malaysia may forbid any publication, article, caricature, 
photograph, report, notes, writing, sound, music, statement or any other expression which 
isconsidered) to be prejudicial to public order, morality, security, the relationship with any other 
country; to alarm public opinion or be contrary to any law; or is otherwise prejudicial to public 
interest or national interest. The ban was enforced despite the recent approval, by the Malaysian </p>

Government, of the Media Council Bill (2006) which seeks to ameliorate the most restrictive 
provisions included in the said Printing Presses and Publications Act. It was also reported that 
more than 45 books have been banned by the Malaysian authorities since 2003.  
 
354. On 18 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning the 
alleged bann to enter the territory of Malaysia of a list of <b>109 books</b> by customs officers at 
various entry points. Reportedly the books banned included works by Kahlil Gibran, Salman 
Rushdie's award-winning Midnight's Children and Shalimar the Clown, Gabriel Garcia 
Marquez's Memories of My Melancholy Whore, as well as Anthony Burgess' The Malayan 
Trilogy and Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart. According to the information received, the 
Printing Press Act (PPPA) grants the Internal Security Ministry discretionary power to ban 
undesirable publications (section 7 of PPPA), and foresees that Ministry officers at the border 
refuse the importation of those publications threatening public order, morality security or 
national interest even if they have not been previously banned by the Ministry (section 9 of 
PPPA).  
<b>Observations 
</b> 
355. At the time this report was finalized, the Special Rapporteur had not received any replies 
to the communications sent. The Special Rapporteur therefore invites the Government to respond 
to these allegations.   
 
</p>
<p><b>Maldives 
</b> 
356. On 30 November 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal 
concerning Mr<b> Ahmed Falah</b>, a freelance cameraman who has documented incidents of police 
brutality and the suppression of peaceful demonstrations in order to draw international attention 
to the situation of human rights violations in the Maldives. According to the information 
received, on 13 November 2006, Mr Falah was arrested at his home in Mal&#233;. There were no 
indications that a summons had been issued for him to report to a police station. Sources indicate 
he is being investigated in relation to terrorist charges as the authorities allege, that while on an 
official visit to Naifaru Island in October 2006, &#8220;he patted his pockets and said that he had box-
cutters&#8221;. According to reports received, he is currently detained in Dhoonidoo Detention Centre. 
Mr Falah has reportedly been subject to police harassment on previous occasions in relation to 
his participation in peaceful demonstrations and his work in recording human rights violations. 
On 21 September 2003 he was allegedly arrested in the context of the civil protests which 
occurred in Mal&#233; following the alleged killing of an inmate and subsequent shootings of other 
prisoners in Maafushi Prison.  He is reported to have been arrested at 2:00 a.m. by 15- riot police 
who were accompanied by an armoured tank  He was allegedly handcuffed and blindfolded upon 
arrest and remained so for three days, while also being tied to more than fifty other prisoners. 
According to reports, he was later kept in solitary confinement and was eventually released 
without charge after spending 45 days in detention. In January 2004, Mr Falah was reportedly 
arrested after filming a confrontation between the mother of a prisoner who was reportedly 
tortured and murdered in prison, and a member of the police who had been in charge of the 
prison and was allegedly involved in the shootings in Maafushi. He was asked to surrender the 
videotape which he refused to do. He was detained for several days and released without charge. 
According to sources, in June 2004, after the death of a heroin addict hours after he had been </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 134 
 
released from police custody, Mr Falah went to the hospital where the victim had been brought, 
in order to inquire about what had happened and to record the event. The following day he 
allegedly received a summons to attend the police station where he was questioned in relation to 
his visit to the hospital however he was released later that day. On 15 February, after Mr Falah&#8217;s 
name apparently appeared on a list of nominees for the Caretaker Committee of the exiled 
Maldivian Democratic Party, police came looking for him and his sister-in-law at his home but 
as he was not there, his wife and sons were allegedly taken and detained by the police and a 
summons was issued.  He went to the police station on 14 February and his family were released 
the following day. On this occasion he reportedly spent 35 days in detention before he was 
released without charge. On 12 and 13 August 2004, Mr Falah reportedly attended and filmed a 
demonstration which was held in protest against the detention of three political prisoners. 
According to reports he was arrested on 14 August 2006 and was blindfolded for fifteen hours 
and handcuffed for five days. He was allegedly held at Girifushi Military Training Island, before 
being transferred to Dhoonidhoo Detention Island where he was held until 28 November 2004. 
During the journey to Dhoonidhoo it is reported that he was severely beaten while blindfolded 
and handcuffed. Mr Falah was again arrested on 22 January 2005 supposedly for filming 
confrontations between voters and election officials during the Maldivian parliamentary 
elections, which allegedly resulted in the police using force to disperse the crowd. Furthermore, 
the police reportedly used an electric shock baton on Mr Falah and destroyed his video camera. 
He was charged on 12 April 2005 for &#8220;disobedience to order&#8221; after apparently raising his voice 
near Giyysudheen school on 22 January and was instructed not to attend any assemblies. On 7 
May 2006, Mr Falah was allegedly arrested at his home for evading court summons which he 
claims he never received. He was released on 10 May 2006. However, he had mentioned when 
questioned that he had a knife under his motorcycle from a fishing trip which was subsequently 
found during a police search. Reports indicated that later the same day, an announcement was 
made on state-run television and radio stations that it was illegal to carry knives or other such 
weapons. He was later charged and convicted of &#8220;disobedience to order&#8221;. Concern is expressed 
that Mr Falah&#8217;s most recent arrest may represent an attempt by the authorities to deter and 
prevent Mr Falah from documenting and publicising human rights violations perpetrated by state 
agents in the Maldives. 
 
<b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
 
</b>357. By letter dated 8 July 2006, the Permanent Mission of the Republic of Maldives responded 
to the urgent appeal sent jointly by the Special Representative, and the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of expression, on 8 July 2005. The Mission 
stated that pending the official response from the Government in relation to the aforementioned 
communication it wished to forwad, for information, a press release issued on 11 July 2005. The 
press release refers to the Maldives Government&#8217;s commitment to the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and indicates that the protection and promotion of human rights is at the heart of 
the democratic agenda outlined by the President in June 2005.  
 
<b>Observations 
 
</b>358. At the date this report was finalized, no reply had been received regarding the 
communication sent by the Special Rapporteur on 30 November 2006. The Special Rapporteur 
invites the Government to reply to this communication. </p>

n&#8217;a jou&#233; aucun r&#244;le. Selon cette plainte, l&#8217;ESISC avait publi&#233; en juin 2005 une &#233;tude analytique 
au sujet du &#171;Front Polisario&#187; dont le but &#233;tait de d&#233;terminer si cette entit&#233; avait effectivement des 
racines dans les tribus sahraouies, faisant d&#8217;elle une organisation populaire remplissant les 
conditions requises pour &#234;tre le repr&#233;sentant exclusif des populations sahraouies.  Les 
responsables du Centre ont &#233;t&#233; surpris de lire dans le num&#233;ro 233 du <i>Journal hebdomadaire</i>

ajout&#233; le gros titre suivant: &#171; Le Polisario est il fini ? &#187;.  Le <i>Journal hebdomadaire</i> consacre en

toutes les analyses sur le Polisario ne faisaient que reprendre la th&#232;se officielle marocaine et que, 
m&#234;me si le Polisario &#233;tait moribond, les conclusions de cette &#233;tude &#171;dirig&#233;e&#187; n&#8217;&#233;taient ni 
productives ni cr&#233;dibles.  &#192; la page 22 du <i>Journal hebdomadaire</i> figure le titre: &#171; Les mauvais 
arguments d&#8217;un rapport t&#233;l&#233;guid&#233; par Rabat; le Polisario est il fini ? &#187;, avec en en t&#234;te le mot

savoir que, &#233;tant donn&#233; qu&#8217;il est faux d&#8217;affirmer ouvertement que le Polisario est fini, c&#8217;est le 
Gouvernement marocain qui a charg&#233; le Centre europ&#233;en d&#8217;&#233;tude strat&#233;gique de tirer des 
conclusions favorables au Royaume en employant des m&#233;thodes contraires &#224; l&#8217;&#233;thique (achat de 
consciences et falsification des faits).  &#192; la page 23 de la revue, le journaliste Fahd Iraqi dit en 
substance que le rapport du Centre europ&#233;en de la s&#233;curit&#233; et de l&#8217;intelligence strat&#233;gique relatif 
au Polisario a les faiblesses de n&#8217;importe quel travail de commande. Il ajoute que la th&#232;se du 
Centre n&#8217;est qu&#8217;une caricature des th&#232;ses marocaines.  L&#8217;hebdomadaire publie aux pages 24 et 25 
un autre article non sign&#233; (ce qui donne &#224; penser qu&#8217;il contient la position officielle de la revue) 
intitul&#233; &#171; Un rapport sur commande &#187;. En substance, il y est dit en introduction que le Centre est 
une entreprise commerciale qui se finance sur la base de contrats de recherche avec des soci&#233;t&#233;s 
priv&#233;es et qu&#8217;il est possible que le Royaume du Maroc ait demand&#233; &#224; des soci&#233;t&#233;s priv&#233;es 
travaillant pour lui de financer cette &#233;tude. L&#8217;auteur de l&#8217;article conclut en affirmant clairement 
que le Maroc a vers&#233; de l&#8217;argent au Centre pour qu&#8217;il tire des conclusions propres &#224; satisfaire le 
Royaume, mais qu&#8217;une communaut&#233; internationale avis&#233;e ne se laissera pas influencer par les 
conclusions de l&#8217;&#233;tude.  L&#8217;avocat du plaignant a estim&#233; que l&#8217;affirmation du <i>Journal 
hebdomadaire</i> selon laquelle les auteurs de l&#8217;&#233;tude &#233;taient acquis &#224; la th&#232;se marocaine &#233;tait 
fausse, insultante et diffamatoire, et constituait une atteinte flagrante &#224; la cr&#233;dibilit&#233; du Centre 
car ce dernier n&#8217;&#233;tait pas compos&#233; de mercenaires qui mettaient leurs connaissances au service 
de la partie qui paie le plus.  Il s&#8217;agissait en effet d&#8217;une institution prestigieuse qui occupait une 
place de premier plan sur la sc&#232;ne internationale dans le domaine de la recherche strat&#233;gique sur 
la s&#233;curit&#233; et des renseignements. En cons&#233;quence, il ne pouvait consid&#233;rer qu&#8217;en publiant ces 
articles l&#8217;hebdomadaire avait fait preuve de bonne foi, agissant dans le cadre de ce que le 
l&#233;gislateur marocain a qualifi&#233; d&#8217;objectifs nobles de la presse consistant &#224; transmettre les 
informations de mani&#232;re fid&#232;le et honn&#234;te.  Apr&#232;s la pr&#233;sentation de l&#8217;affaire au tribunal, l&#8217;avocat 
des deux d&#233;fendeurs a demand&#233; au juge d&#8217;autoriser la comparution de deux t&#233;moins et de ne pas 
accepter les all&#233;gations de l&#8217;avocat du plaignant. Le tribunal a d&#233;cid&#233; de ne pas faire droit &#224; la 
demande de l&#8217;avocat de la d&#233;fense au motif qu&#8217;elle n&#8217;&#233;tait pas justifi&#233;e; selon le juge, la 
d&#233;position de t&#233;moins ne pouvait remplacer des &#233;l&#233;ments de preuve, surtout qu&#8217;il ne s&#8217;agissait 
pas de d&#233;montrer la v&#233;racit&#233; du contenu de l&#8217;article, dans la mesure o&#249; le plaignant vis&#233; par la 
diffamation n&#8217;&#233;tait pas une personne de droit public, contrairement &#224; ce que requiert la loi. En 
outre, le juge a estim&#233; que les conditions vis&#233;es &#224; l&#8217;article 73 du Code de la presse et de l&#8217;&#233;dition, 
qui devaient &#234;tre remplies dans leur totalit&#233;, n&#8217;&#233;taient pas r&#233;unies et que la demande de 
comparution de t&#233;moins aurait d&#251; &#234;tre assortie de pi&#232;ces prouvant que l&#8217;&#233;tude effectu&#233;e par le 
Centre avait &#233;t&#233; financ&#233;e par le Maroc comme l&#8217;exige l&#8217;article 49 du m&#234;me Code, qui stipule ce 
qui suit: &#171;Les responsables de la publication doivent disposer avant publication de preuves 
&#233;tablissant les faits qu&#8217;ils rapportent.&#187;.  Il &#233;tait indiqu&#233; dans la demande que les t&#233;moins 
d&#233;montreraient que le contenu du rapport ne r&#233;pondait pas aux crit&#232;res scientifiques et &#233;tait 
contraire &#224; la v&#233;rit&#233;. Or ce qui est calomnieux et insultant dans les articles du <i>Journal 
hebdomadaire</i>, c&#8217;est plut&#244;t l&#8217;affirmation selon laquelle le rapport a &#233;t&#233; financ&#233; par le Maroc et 
qu&#8217;il s&#8217;agissait d&#8217;un travail accompli contre r&#233;mun&#233;ration. &#192; la m&#234;me s&#233;ance, &#224; la demande de 
l&#8217;avocat des d&#233;fendeurs, le proc&#232;s a &#233;t&#233; ajourn&#233;. &#192; la s&#233;ance suivante tenue le 2 f&#233;vrier 2006, 
&#233;taient pr&#233;sents les deux d&#233;fendeurs, leur avocat et le repr&#233;sentant en justice et avocat du Centre, 
le b&#226;tonnier Mohammed Ziane.  Apr&#232;s que leur avocat eut pris connaissance des documents 
pertinents, les deux d&#233;fendeurs ont d&#233;pos&#233; une d&#233;claration &#233;crite dans laquelle ils ont annonc&#233; 
qu&#8217;ils se retiraient, refusant d&#8217;obtemp&#233;rer &#224; l&#8217;injonction de la Cour de r&#233;pondre aux questions 
figurant dans la plainte.  Ce retrait constituait une tentative pour entraver le cours de la justice et 
a priv&#233; les deux d&#233;fendeurs du droit d&#8217;utiliser les moyens de d&#233;fense dont ils disposaient face &#224; la </p>

partie demanderesse.  Apr&#232;s avoir entendu la plaidoirie de l&#8217;avocat du plaignant et la r&#233;quisition 
du Procureur g&#233;n&#233;ral, la Cour a d&#233;cid&#233; de mettre le verdict en d&#233;lib&#233;ration jusqu&#8217;au 16 f&#233;vrier 
2006. &#192; cette date, la Cour a condamn&#233; le pr&#233;venu Aboubakr Jama&#239;, pour calomnie et injures 
publiques, et le pr&#233;venu Fahd Iraqi, pour complicit&#233; dans ces actes, &#224; une amende de 50 000 
dirhams et &#224; verser solidairement &#224; la partie demanderesse 3 millions de dirhams de dommages 
int&#233;r&#234;ts. La l&#233;gislation nationale relative &#224; la presse et &#224; l&#8217;&#233;dition est la suivante. Le l&#233;gislateur 
marocain a r&#233;glement&#233; les activit&#233;s de la presse dans le Dahir du 15 novembre 1958 tel que 
modifi&#233; par la loi n&#186; 77 du 3 octobre 2002. Conform&#233;ment aux instruments internationaux relatifs 
aux droits de l&#8217;homme consacrant le principe du respect de la libert&#233; d&#8217;expression, le Code de la 
presse et de l&#8217;&#233;dition stipule que la libert&#233; de publication des journaux, de l&#8217;imprimerie, de 
l&#8217;&#233;dition et de la librairie est garantie, tout comme le droit de se procurer des informations et 
d&#8217;acc&#233;der aux sources d&#8217;information. Toutefois, cette libert&#233; n&#8217;est pas absolue. Elle doit &#234;tre 
exerc&#233;e dans le respect d&#8217;une s&#233;rie de principes constitutionnels, l&#233;gislatifs et d&#233;ontologiques, et 
de mani&#232;re honn&#234;te et sinc&#232;re. Le Code &#233;num&#232;re d&#8217;autre part les diff&#233;rentes infractions p&#233;nales 
commises par l&#8217;un des moyens publics vis&#233;s &#224; son article 38, infractions dont fait partie la 
calomnie, qui est d&#233;finie par le l&#233;gislateur, &#224; l&#8217;article 44, comme toute &#171; all&#233;gation ou imputation 
d&#8217;un fait qui porte atteinte &#224; l&#8217;honneur ou &#224; la consid&#233;ration des personnes ou du corps auquel le 
fait est imput&#233; &#187;. En outre, toute &#171; expression outrageante, terme de m&#233;pris portant atteinte &#224; la 
dignit&#233;, ou invective qui ne renferme l&#8217;imputation d&#8217;aucun fait, est une injure &#187;. Le l&#233;gislateur 
marocain &#233;tablit dans le m&#234;me article la responsabilit&#233; p&#233;nale r&#233;sultant de la publication directe 
ou par voie de reproduction de la diffamation ou de l&#8217;injure, m&#234;me si elle est faite sous forme 
dubitative ou si elle vise une personne ou un corps non express&#233;ment nomm&#233;, mais dont 
l&#8217;identification est rendue possible par les termes du discours, des cris, des menaces, des &#233;crits 
ou des imprim&#233;s, des placards ou des affiches incrimin&#233;s. Il convient de signaler que l&#8217;article 67 
du Code de la presse et de l&#8217;&#233;dition d&#233;signe les personnes dont la responsabilit&#233; p&#233;nale est 
engag&#233;e en cas de commission par la voie de la presse des infractions susmentionn&#233;es, &#224; savoir: 
les directeurs de publication ou &#233;diteurs, quelles que soient leurs professions ou leurs 
d&#233;nominations; &#224; leur d&#233;faut, les auteurs; &#224; d&#233;faut des auteurs, les imprimeurs; &#224; d&#233;faut des 
imprimeurs, les vendeurs et les distributeurs et afficheurs. Dans les cas o&#249; les &#233;crits, images, 
dessins, symboles ou les autres moyens d&#8217;expression utilis&#233;s pour commettre l&#8217;infraction ont &#233;t&#233; 
publi&#233;s &#224; l&#8217;&#233;tranger, et dans tous les cas o&#249; il s&#8217;av&#232;re, pour quelque raison que ce soit, impossible 
de reconna&#238;tre l&#8217;auteur de l&#8217;infraction ou de le poursuivre, sera puni comme auteur principal 
l&#8217;auteur de l&#8217;article, de l&#8217;image, du dessin, du symbole ou du moyen d&#8217;expression ou celui qui en 
est l&#8217;importateur, le distributeur ou le vendeur. On notera aussi que les propri&#233;taires des 
journaux, publications p&#233;riodiques et moyens d&#8217;information audiovisuels et &#233;lectroniques sont 
responsables des condamnations p&#233;cuniaires prononc&#233;es au profit des tiers contre les personnes 
d&#233;sign&#233;es dans les articles 67 et 68 du Code de la presse &#224; d&#233;faut d&#8217;application desdites 
condamnations &#224; l&#8217;encontre des condamn&#233;s. Il convient par ailleurs de signaler que le jugement 
de premi&#232;re instance susmentionn&#233; n&#8217;est pas d&#233;finitif. Il a fait l&#8217;objet d&#8217;un appel qui sera 
examin&#233; le 14 mars 2006 par la cour d&#8217;appel de Rabat. &#192; cette occasion, les d&#233;fendeurs pourront 
pr&#233;senter tous les arguments juridiques qu&#8217;ils jugeront pertinents dans cette affaire. Le 10 mars 
2006, le gouvernement a r&#233;pondu &#224; un appel urgent envoy&#233; par le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial le 3 
novembre 2005 sur <b>Anas Tadili</b>. Le gouvernement informe que le d&#233;nomm&#233; Anas Tadili a &#233;t&#233; 
condamn&#233; par le Tribunal de premi&#232;re instance de Rabat &#224; six mois d&#8217;emprisonnement avec 
sursis, au paiement d&#8217;un montant de 506 720, 86 dirhams &#224; l&#8217;Administration de douanes et des 
contributions indirectes et &#224; une amende de 2 604 533, 30 dirhams. Ce jugement a &#233;t&#233; confirm&#233; 
en appel le 8 mai 2001.  L&#8217;Administration des imp&#244;ts et des contributions indirectes a demand&#233; </p>

que soit &#233;mise une ordonnance de contrainte par corps &#224; son encontre pour non-paiement de la 
somme exig&#233;.  La dur&#233;e de la contrainte par corps a &#233;t&#233; fix&#233;e &#224; 10 mois.  Le 16 avril 2004, 
l&#8217;int&#233;ress&#233; a &#233;t&#233; incarc&#233;r&#233; pour ex&#233;cuter cette peine. Au terme de la p&#233;riode de 10 mois 
susmentionn&#233;e, M. Tadili a commenc&#233; &#224; ex&#233;cuter une autre peine d&#8217;un an d&#8217;emprisonnement, &#224; 
laquelle il avait &#233;t&#233; condamn&#233; pour avoir insult&#233; et calomni&#233; un ministre.  Compte tenu de ce qui 
pr&#233;c&#232;de, le maintien en d&#233;tention de M. Tadili pour qu&#8217;il ex&#233;cute le reste de sa peine est tout 
effet conforme &#224; la loi. Selon les informations fournies par le Directeur des &#233;tablissements 
p&#233;nitentiaires et de la r&#233;insertion, l&#8217;int&#233;ress&#233; est actuellement d&#233;tenu dans une cellule 
individuelle comme il avait demand&#233; oralement au Directeur de la prison. Il est soumis au 
r&#233;gime ordinaire, en ce sens qu&#8217;il peut effectuer des promenades en plein air avec les autres 
prisonniers, prendre des douches et recevoir des visites et qu&#8217;il jouit de tous les autres droits qui 
lui sont garantis par la loi. Sur le plain sanitaire, il b&#233;n&#233;ficie des soins n&#233;cessaires chaque fois 
que son &#233;tat de sant&#233; le requiert.  
 
401. Le 20 f&#233;vrier et le 30 mars 2006, le Gouvernement a r&#233;pondu &#224; une lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation 
envoy&#233;e par le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial et le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la question de la Torture, le 
3 novembre 2005.  Le 30 octobre 2005, la ville de La&#226;youne fut le th&#233;&#226;tre de violences au cours 
desquelles environ 150 individus particip&#232;rent. Ils jet&#232;rent des pierres aux passants sur la rue de 
la Mecque, endommageant deux v&#233;hicules des forces de l&#8217;ordre et effray&#232;rent la population. 
L&#8217;individu d&#233;nomm&#233; <b>Hamdi Lmbarki</b> fut gravement bless&#233;; il fut transport&#233; &#224; l&#8217;h&#244;pital mais 
succomba &#224; ses blessures. Le Bureau du Procureur Public ordonna une autopsie sur le corps du 
d&#233;funt. L&#8217;autopsie fut r&#233;alis&#233;e par 3 docteurs &#224; l&#8217;h&#244;pital Moulay Hassan Ben El-Mehdi qui 
conclurent que la mort avait pour origine des blessures au niveau du cr&#226;ne. Le p&#232;re du d&#233;funt, M. 
Lmbarki al-Salek, d&#233;posa une plainte au bureau du Procureur du Roi de la Cour d&#8217;Appel de 
La&#226;youne, demandant l&#8217;ouverture d&#8217;une enqu&#234;te afin de conna&#238;tre les circonstances entourant la 
mort de son fils. L&#8217;affaire fut transf&#233;r&#233;e &#224; la Division nationale de la Police judiciaire afin qu&#8217;une 
enqu&#234;te soit ouverte et pour d&#233;f&#233;rer devant la justice les personnes responsables de cette mort. 
Par ailleurs, le Bureau du Procureur ordonna une seconde autopsie pour d&#233;terminer les coups et 
blessures re&#231;us et identifier les causes de la mort. Cette autopsie fut conduite par des sp&#233;cialistes 
de l&#8217;H&#244;pital universitaire Ibn Rushd &#224; Casablanca. La famille du d&#233;funt fut inform&#233;e de toutes 
les mesures prises au cours de cette l&#8217;affaire.  Sur la base des r&#233;sultats de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te, il fut d&#233;cid&#233; 
que les deux agents de police impliqu&#233;s dans l&#8217;affaire devaient &#234;tre pr&#233;sent&#233;s au magistrat en 
charge de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te au motif d&#8217;avoir inflig&#233; des blessures avec arme et d&#8217;avoir caus&#233; la mort sans 
intention de la donner dans l&#8217;exercice de leurs fonctions d&#8217;agents de l&#8217;&#201;tat. Apr&#232;s avoir interrog&#233; 
les deux agents, le m&#234;me magistrat les condamna &#224; des peines de prison.  Il convient de signaler 
que les deux policiers, Amsaoud Abderrahim et Hassen Rochdi, ont demand&#233;, par l'interm&#233;diaire 
de leurs avocats, Mohammed Kerrout du barreau de Rabat et Mohammed Jankal du barreau de 
Casablanca &#224; la Chambre p&#233;nale de la Cour supr&#234;me de se saisir de l'affaire aux fins de faire 
pr&#233;valoir l'int&#233;r&#234;t public et d'assurer la bonne administration de la justice. L'affaire qui fait l'objet 
des dossiers n&#176; 06/6/1188 et 06/6/1189 est encore en instance devant la Chambre. 
 
402. Le 20 f&#233;vrier 2006, le Gouvernement a r&#233;pondu &#224; un appel urgent envoy&#233;, le 8 novembre 
2005, par le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, conjointement avec le Vice-pr&#233;sident du Groupe de Travail sur 
la d&#233;tention arbitraire, la Repr&#233;sentante sp&#233;ciale du Secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral concernant la situation des 
d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l'homme.  Le Procureur du Roi &#224; la Cour d&#8217;Appel de L&#226;yyoune 
conduisit une enqu&#234;te avec la Police judiciaire au sujet de l&#8217;usage all&#233;gu&#233; de la force contre 
<b>Gaoudi Mohamed Fadel</b>, un membre de la branche Sahara du Forum V&#233;rit&#233; et Justice, </p>

<b>Hammoud Iguilid</b>, Pr&#233;sident la section de La&#226;youne de l&#8217;Association marocaine pour les droits 
de l&#8217;homme, <b>Brahim Sabbar</b> et <b>Brahim Dahane</b>, Pr&#233;sident de l&#8217;Association sahraouie des 
victimes de violations graves des droits de l&#8217;homme, au cours de leur visite &#224; <b>Lakhal Mohamed 
Salem</b>, d&#233;tenu au si&#232;ge des forces de police. Il appara&#238;t que les derniers cit&#233;s ne furent jamais 
arr&#234;t&#233;s ou d&#233;tenus et ainsi aucune enqu&#234;te ne fut conduite &#224; leur sujet.  Il s&#8217;av&#232;re que Iguilid 
Hammoud and Brahim Sabbar &#233;taient recherch&#233;s par la Police judiciaire pour leur implication 
dans les &#233;v&#233;nements violents &#224; La&#226;youne et que ces deux hommes avaient pris part &#224; des actes de 
destruction et de violence causant des d&#233;g&#226;ts aux domaines public et priv&#233;.  Fadel Gaoudi, pour 
sa part, avait &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;c&#233;demment pr&#233;sent&#233; au Procureur du Roi de la Cour d&#8217;Appel de La&#226;youne 
(dossier n&#186; 936/CRIM/JP), le 23 janvier 2005. Apr&#232;s examen, le Procureur d&#233;cida de ne pas 
engager de poursuites &#224; son encontre et le dossier fut class&#233; en raison de l&#8217;absence de preuve de 
toute activit&#233; criminelle de la part de l&#8217;individu concern&#233;.  Brahim Dahane fut &#233;galement 
pr&#233;sent&#233; au Procureur du Roi de la Cour d&#8217;Appel de La&#226;youne (dossier n&#186; 1270/CRIM/JP), le 1er 
novembre 2005. Il ressort de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te qu&#8217;il avait lou&#233; une maison sur la rue Tantan et, au 
pr&#233;texte d&#8217;y vivre, y avait &#233;tabli le quartier g&#233;n&#233;ral d&#8217;une association non-enregistr&#233;e &#224; laquelle il 
avait donn&#233; le nom de Association Sahraouie des victimes de violations graves des droits de 
l&#8217;homme afin de la faire passer pour une association s&#8217;occupant des droits de l&#8217;homme. En fait, 
lui et ses complices avaient d&#233;cid&#233; d&#8217;&#233;tablir des cellules &#224; travers lesquelles ils avaient l&#8217;intention 
de mettre &#224; ex&#233;cution leurs d&#233;cisions et plans dans le plus grand secret. Suite au transfert d&#8217;un 
des d&#233;tenus, Ahmed Hadi, ils profit&#232;rent de l&#8217;occasion pour organiser une manifestation devant 
la maison de la famille de l&#8217;individu en question et essay&#232;rent de d&#233;stabiliser la situation en 
jetant des pierres et des cocktails Molotov sur les forces de l&#8217;ordre et en faisant exploser des 
bouteilles de gaz, causant ainsi de nombreux d&#233;g&#226;ts. Le 30 novembre 2005, suite &#224; la mort de 
Hamdi Lmbarki, l&#8217;individu en question en compagnie d&#8217;autres personnes se r&#233;unirent sans 
autorisation. Ils &#233;taient lourdement arm&#233;s de couteaux, qui &#233;taient clairement visibles, de pierres 
et de cocktails Molotov. Quand il leur fut intim&#233; l&#8217;ordre de se disperser, ils jet&#232;rent des pierres 
sur les forces de l&#8217;ordre, brul&#232;rent le drapeau national et jet&#232;rent une grande bouteille de gaz avec 
la claire intention de vouloir infliger de nombreuses blessures dans les rangs des forces de 
l&#8217;ordre. Plusieurs agents de police furent gravement bless&#233;s et deux voitures de police furent 
d&#233;truites. Ainsi, le Procureur du Roi d&#233;cida d&#8217;ouvrir une enqu&#234;te (dossier n&#186; 166/05) avec 
l&#8217;intention de poursuivre en justice l&#8217;individu en question. L&#8217;enqu&#234;te suit son cours. &#192; noter que 
ni la police, ni le Bureau du Procureur du Roi n&#8217;ont &#233;t&#233; inform&#233;s de plaintes relatives &#224; des 
violences contre la femme ou deux s&#339;urs de Fadel Gaoudi.  
 
403. Le 7 d&#233;cembre 2006, le Gouvernement a r&#233;pondu &#224; un appel urgent envoy&#233; le 29 juin 
2006.  Le Gouvernement informe que,  le 17 juin 2006, &#224; l&#8217;entr&#233;e de la ville d&#8217;El Aaiun, la police 
a arr&#234;t&#233; <b>Ahmad al-Siba`i</b>, <b>Ibrahim al-Sabar</b>, <b>Sidi Mohammed Huday</b> et <b>Sidi Ahmad

&#233;t&#233; appr&#233;hend&#233; ; les quatre ont ensuite &#233;t&#233; amen&#233;s au poste de police provincial. Ahmad al-Siba`i 
&#233;tait d&#233;j&#224; recherch&#233; par les autorit&#233;s puisqu&#8217;il &#233;tait suspect&#233; d&#8217;avoir form&#233; un groupe criminel 
arm&#233;, d&#8217;attaque arm&#233;e, d&#8217;agression contre un fonctionnaire public, de s&#233;dition et de d&#233;gradation 
des biens de l&#8217;&#201;tat.  Deux avis de recherche avaient &#233;t&#233; &#233;mis &#224; son &#233;gard. Interrog&#233; par les 
agents, il a avou&#233; avoir voulu int&#233;grer le Forum pour la V&#233;rit&#233; et la Justice, une organisation 
bannie en 2004. Il a &#233;galement avou&#233; avoir organis&#233; des manifestations en soutien d&#8217;un individu

bureaux de la police du cinqui&#232;me arrondissement, du camp Al-Wahdah et de la zone industrielle 
furent attaqu&#233;s.  Ahmad al-Siba`i a &#233;t&#233; &#233;crou&#233; le 17 juin 2006 et son cas fut examin&#233; le 21 juin 
par un juge du Parquet. Le m&#234;me jour, il a demand&#233; de passer un examen m&#233;dical, chose faite le 
13 septembre 2006. L&#8217;examen n&#8217;a d&#233;tect&#233; aucun signe de violence physique et aucune plainte de 
violence n&#8217;a &#233;t&#233; d&#233;pos&#233;e par Ahmad al-Siba`i ou par son avocat.  &#192; l&#8217;instar de Ahmad al-Siba`i, 
Ibrahim al-Sabar fut &#233;galement conduit au poste de police provincial; deux avis de recherche 
avaient &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; &#233;mis contre lui, pour formation de groupe criminel arm&#233;, attaque arm&#233;e, 
agression de fonctionnaire public, s&#233;dition et d&#233;gradation des biens de l&#8217;&#201;tat.  Ibrahim al-Sabar a 
&#233;t&#233; &#233;crou&#233; le 17 septembre 2006 et le 19 septembre, il a &#233;t&#233; condamn&#233; &#224; deux ans 
d&#8217;emprisonnement ferme et &#224; une amende de 2 000 dirhams. Cette condamnation a &#233;t&#233; confirm&#233;e 
en appel. Sidi Mohammed Huday a &#233;t&#233; emprisonn&#233; le 17 juin 2006 et son cas fut examin&#233; le 19 
juin par un juge du parquet. Il a ensuite &#233;t&#233; condamn&#233; &#224; trois ans de prison ferme et au paiement 
d&#8217;une amende de 2 000 dirhams, verdict confirm&#233; en appel. Malgr&#233; cela, Sidi Mohammed Huday 
a d&#233;cid&#233; de d&#233;poser une plainte qui a &#233;t&#233; enregistr&#233;e au num&#233;ro 64/06.  Le droit marocain 
qualifie de crimes les actes de violence et de torture, m&#234;me s&#8217;il ne d&#233;finit pas ces termes de 
mani&#232;re pr&#233;cise. De ce fait, c&#8217;est un crime que de violer une libert&#233; fondamentale d'une 
personne, son int&#233;grit&#233; physique ou sa dignit&#233;, et il y a plusieurs lois et mesures en place pour 
dissuader de commettre de tels crimes. Par exemple, le Code p&#233;nal dispose, inter alia, qu&#8217;un 
juge, qu&#8217;un  membre ou agent des autorit&#233;s publiques ou des forces de l&#8217;ordre ne peut en aucun 
cas commettre un acte arbitraire qui viole une des libert&#233;s fondamentales ou des droits civiques. 
La Section 225 du Code pr&#233;voit une peine de privation des droits civiques pour de tels actes et le 
coupable se verra appliquer une peine pr&#233;vue au paragraphe 3, section 436 du Code, en 
l&#8217;occurrence la suspension des droits civiques pour une dur&#233;e de 20 &#224; 30 ann&#233;es si le coupable 
&#233;tait investi de l&#8217;exercice de l&#8217;autorit&#233; publique ou s&#8217;il appartient &#224; l&#8217;une des cat&#233;gories de 
personnes mentionn&#233;es dans la section 225 et si l&#8217;acte arbitraire ou la violation de la libert&#233; fut 
commis ou ordonn&#233; &#224; des fins personnelles ou pour satisfaire des d&#233;sirs tiers. Puisque le Maroc 
est d&#233;termin&#233; &#224; renforcer et promouvoir les droits et libert&#233;s, &#224; modifier sa l&#233;gislation interne 
pour la mettre en conformit&#233; avec les instruments internationaux qu&#8217;il a ratifi&#233;s, et &#224; consolider 
les m&#233;canismes institutionnels qui supervisent le respect des droits de l&#8217;homme, le pays a ratifi&#233; 
tous les instruments internationaux en mati&#232;re de protection des droits de l&#8217;homme, notamment 
la Convention contre la torture et autres peines ou traitements cruels, inhumains ou d&#233;gradants 
ratifi&#233;e le 21 novembre 1996. Dans le but de mettre en conformit&#233; la l&#233;gislation interne avec la 
Convention, la loi Anti-Torture n&#186; 43.04 d&#233;finit la torture conform&#233;ment &#224; la d&#233;finition contenue 
dans la Convention, identifie les victimes et sp&#233;cifie les peines relatives &#224; la torture. Les 
circonstances aggravantes dont il fait r&#233;f&#233;rence dans la loi incluent les cas o&#249; le crime est 
commis contre un juge ou un membre des forces de l&#8217;ordre ou un agent public, durant l&#8217;exercice 
de ses fonctions, ou contre un t&#233;moin, une victime ou un plaignant, soit parce que cette personne 
a fait une d&#233;claration ou d&#233;pos&#233; une plainte dans le but d&#8217;intenter une action en justice, soit pour 
dissuader cette personne d&#8217;agir de la sorte.

405. On 30 January 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and 
Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard 
of physical and mental health , sent a letter of allegation regarding Mr <b>Shabang Maulid Abdul</b> 
(imprisoned since October 2000), Mr <b>Maringo Makuku</b> (imprisoned since September 2000), 
and Mr <b>Ganyua Muimure</b> (imprisoned since September 2000), all of them currently at Maputo 
B.O. Prison, and Mr <b>Abdul Kariem Gabral </b>(<b>S.P. Kunene, </b>held at Maputo B.O. Prison between 
24 December 2003 and 14 September 2004). According to the information received, no charges 
have been brought against Mr Shabang Maulid Abdul, Mr Maringo Makuku and Mr Ganzua 
Muimure since 2000. No charges were brought against Mr Kuene during his term in prison. 
Moreover, he could not understand the policemen and guards as he did not speak Portuguese and 
no interpretation was provided. Conditions in Maputo B.O. Prison were harsh, there were no 
toilets or running water, no sleeping mats were provided; prisoners got only one meal per day 
(dirty boiled beans and rice). Malaria was endemic. When Mr Kunene and Mr Makuku 
contracted it, they vomited blood. However, they did not receive any medical treatment, until 
they fell into a coma. Only then, they were given medicine (which, however, had expired more 
than two years earlier). The two prisoners experienced and continue experiencing serious health 
problems (in particular heart and stomach problems). During the initial period in prison inmates 
were chained from their necks, down to the waist, and to the legs, 24 hours a day, which meant 
that they were carrying 10 kg of chain. Moreover, prison guards routinely assaulted, shooted and 
killed inmates in the prison yard.  
 
406. On 27 January 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in Myanmar and Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the situation of human rights defenders sent a letter of allegation concerning a political prisoner, 
<b>Ko Khin Maung Lwin</b> (38 years old), who died on January 11 2006 in Putao hospital. A pro-
democracy activist, originally involved in the demonstrations of 1988, Ko Khin Maung Lwin 
subsequently joined the Democracy Party and was a candidate in the 1990 elections, for the 
Kunchangon township constituency. In 1998, he wrote an open letter of appeal entitled &quot;HELP&quot; 
to the Sangha Maha Nayaka (the Senior Buddhist Abbots' Council), the Government of 
Myanmar and the General-Secretary of the National League for Democracy, Daw Aung San Suu 
Kyi. In the letter he expressed his concern about the poverty and hardship experienced by the 
people of Myanmar and stated the need for action to be taken to address these issues. He was 
subsequently arrested under the Printers and Publishers Registration Law, which is invoked 
against those who print, publish or distribute written materials without official permission from 
the Government.&#8217; He was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment with hard labour. Since 1998, he 
has been variously held in Insein, Kale, Loikaw and Putao prisons. Throughout his 
imprisonment, he suffered on a consistent basis from heart disease, hypertension, haemorrhoids, 
urethra stricture and malaria. Despite his repeated requests to the prison authorities for the 
necessary medical treatment and several recommendations from the prison superintendent and a 
senior doctor in Putao Prison for Ko Khin Maung Lwin to be treated in an outside hospital, 
appeals for adequate medical attention were reportedly not followed up upon by the authorities. 
On 10 January, following diagnosis by the prison doctor that he was incurably and seriously ill, 
Ko Khin Maung Lwin was finally transferred to Putao hospital. One day later, he was 
pronounced dead. Grave concern is expressed that Ko Khin Maung Lwin&#8217;s arrest and denial of </p>

medical treatment whilst in prison, may represent an attempt to prevent him from carrying out 
his legitimate activities in defence of human rights. 
 
407. On 6 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection 
of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights in Myanmar, sent an urgent appeal, concerning <b>Ko Thar Cho</b>, a photojournalist 
also known as <b>U Thaung</b>; <b>Ko Moe Htun</b>, a columnist for the magazine <i>Dhamah-Yate</i>, also 
known as <b>Ko Kyaw Thwin</b>; and seven students: <b>Hnin Wint Wint Soe</b>, <b>May Su Su Win</b>, <b>Ne 
Linn Kyaw</b>, <b>Thet Oo</b>, <b>Win Min Htut</b>, <b>Maung Muang Oo</b> and <b>Zeya Aung</b>. According to the 
information received, on 23 March 2006, Ko Thar Cho and Ko Moe Htun were arrested while 
they were driving around the capital city, filming and taking photographs. On the following day, 
they were sentenced to three years' imprisonment for allegedly having violated the Television 
and Video Act, for operating filming business for commercial purpose without a video business 
licence, at the Yamaethin district court. On 29 March 2006, seven above-mentioned students 
from the University of Pegu were arrested for having written and published a poem advocating 
democracy. The poem was entitled 'Daung Man', which reportedly means &quot;Strength of the 
Fighting Peacock&quot;, the symbol of the pro-democracy movement. There are unconfirmed reports 
that the students were initially detained in a police station in Pegu before being transferred to the 
city's prison. Allegations have been received that a government prosecutor was visiting them on 
a daily basis, yet the students have not been permitted to see their families. 
 
408. On 26 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in Myanmar and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders, sent  an urgent appeal concerning Dr. <b>Salai Tun 
Than</b>, professor and human rights defender. He has been appealing to the Government of 
Myanmar to guarantee the civil and political rights of the people of of Myanmar. According to 
the information received, Dr. Salai Tun Than's passport was revoked by the Myammar 
authorities on 7 June 2006, while he was staying in Thailand, days in advance of his planned 
peaceful protest in Myanmar. The protest was scheduled to take place on 19 June. It is alleged 
that his passport was revoked without due course. Prior to this, Dr. Salai Tun Than has been 
arrested by the security forces in November 2001 and detained until May 2003 having petitioned 
for multi-party elections. Grave concern is expressed at the reports indicating that Dr. Salai Tun 
Than's passport was revoked as a direct attempt to prevent him from organizing a peaceful 
protest.  
 
409. On 27 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning four pro-
democracy activists: <b>Aung Than</b>, a member of the National League for Democracy (NLD); 
<b>Zeya Aung</b>, a student of Pegu University; <b>Maung Maung Oo</b>, an owner of a printing workshop; 
and <b>Sein Hlaig</b>. Zeya Aung and Maung Maung Oo have been the subject of the communication 
on 6 April 2006. According to the information received, on 9 June 2006, the four above-
mentioned persons were tried in Pegu, north of Rangoon. They are accused of publishing an anti-
government book of poems called &quot;The Strength of the Fighting Peacock&quot;. Peacock is used as a 
symbol of the pro-democracy movement in Myanmar. It is reported that Aung Than and Zeya 
Aung were sentenced to 19 years' imprisonment. They are also reportedly accused of unlawfully 
crossing the border with Thailand and working with illegal organizations. Maung Maung Oo is 
the owner of the printing workshop where the book was printed, and was sentenced to 14 years' </p>

imprisonment. Sein Hlaig is accused of assisting in dissemination of the book, and was 
sentenced to 7 years' imprisonment. Sein Hlaig is also convicted of printing T-shirts with a 
clenched fist, which is a symbol of struggle.  
 
410. On 6 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and 
the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, sent an urgent appeal 
concerning <b>Min Zeya</b>, <b>Pyone Cho</b>, <b>Myint Aye</b>, former chairman of National League for 
Democracy, a political party in Kyeemyingdaing township, <b>Paw Oo Tun</b> (also known as Min 
Ko Naing), <b>Ko Ko Gyi</b>, and <b>Htay Kywe</b>. According to the allegations received, between 27 and 
30 September 2006, they were arrested at their homes in Yangon by the police and taken to an 
unknown location. It is reported that when they were previously arrested, they were subjected to 
kicking, prolonged solitary confinement, deprivation of sleep, food and water, and were beaten 
until they were unconscious.  
 
411. On 30 November 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in 
Myanmar and the Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers, sent an 
urgent appeal concerning <b>Mr Ko Win Ko </b>and <b>M.r Phyoe Zaw Latt</b> (aka Ko Wa Toat). Mr Win 
Koa, a member of the National League for Democracy (NLD) was at the moment when this 
communication was sent, detained at Paungte Prison, and Mr Zaw Latt detained at Tharawaddy 
Prison. According to the allegations received, both men were stopped by about ten members of 
the Letpadan Township Police and of the Union Solidarity and Development Association 
(USDA) at Letpadan Train Station on 6 October 2006. While searching the men, the officials 
found more than 400 signatures for a petition calling for the release of Ms Daw Aung San Suu 
Kyi, General Secretary of the National League for Democracy, and also student activists who 
had been detained, including Paw Oo Tun (aka Min Ko Naing), Ko Ko Gyi, Htay Kywe, Min 
Zeya, and Pyone Cho. The latter were already the subject matter of a joint urgent appeal on 6 
October 2006, which remained without a reply from your Government. Following the search, U 
Than Myat Soe, USDA Executive, and U Than Zaw Win, USDA member, both from Letpadan 
Township, produced evidence that they claimed to have found in Ko Win Ko's bag. The two men 
were taken to the Letpadan Township Police Station, where Ko Win Ko was charged pursuant to 
Section 353(2) of the Penal Code on accounts of resisting arrest and pursuant to Sections 15(a) 
and 16(a) of the Gambling Act on accounts of illegal gambling. Phyoe Zaw Latt was apparently 
not charged immediately, but kept in detention. The signature sheets were confiscated.<b> </b>On 19 
October 2006 senior lawyer U Khin Maung Yin arrived at the Letpadan Township Court to 
represent Ko Win Ko at his trial scheduled for that day. However, he noted that Ko Win Ko had 
already been heard, convicted and sentenced to three years' imprisonment on the day before 
(criminal case Nos. 652/06 and 653/06). On 25 October 2006 the lawyer attempted to gain access 
to his client at Paungte Prison, but was informed by prison director U Myint Aung to wait for 
few more days. It is not known whether U Khin Maung Yin has been able to establish contact 
with his client up until today.<b> </b>On 22 October 2006, Phyoe Zaw Latt was released from police 
custody by the Letpadan Township Court on a six- months good behaviour bond pursuant to 
Section 5(1)(f)(g) of the 1961 Restriction and Bond Act. However, already on the same day, he 
was rearrested by the Moenyo Township Police at his home township and charged pursuant to 
Sections 420, 465 and 468 of the Penal Code on accounts of deceit and forgery. He was detained </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 159 
 
incommunicado at Tharawaddy Prison awaiting trial. The trial was scheduled for 3 November 
2006 before a special tribunal within the prison, although Phyoe Zaw Latt was charged with 
ordinary offences for which the establishment of a special tribunal is not known under Myanmar 
law. He was not allowed to appoint a lawyer to act on his behalf at the trial.<b> </b>Concern is expressed 
that the arrest, detention and sentencing of Ko Win Ko and Phyoe Zaw Latt may be connected to 
their peaceful human rights activities, namely their legitimate exercise of their right to freedom 
of association and freedom of opinion and expression on behalf of those advocating for 
democratic change. In view of their incommunicado detention further concern is expressed as 
regards their health and physical integrity.<b> 
</b> 
<b>Replies from the Government 
 
</b>412. By letter dated 8 December 2006, the Government of Myanmar replied to the 
communication of 6 October 2006. The Government of Myanmar stated that <b>Min Zeya, Pyone 
Cho, Myint Aye, Paw Oo Tun, Ko Ko Gyi </b>and<b> Htay Kywe </b>committed a number of crimes 
punishable under the existing laws of Myanmar and therefore, they were detained to be 
examined in accordance with the law and procedures of Myanmar. It was found that they 
received assistance from the Embassies of Western countries stationed in Myanmar to make 
contacts with the ex-members of the Myanmar exiled students union in order to receive cash 
donations from abroad. The Government indicated that they used these funds to instigate the 
people to create unrest. In addition, the Government informed that these individuals collected 
and provided distorted information to Foreign News Agencies with the intention to disseminate 
this information to the international community to create misunderstanding of the situation in 
Myanmar. It was also reported that they had contacts with terrorist organizations and that they 
took part in the so-called Plot of the People Battle Committee which had been organised and 
carried out by terrorist organisations.<b>

to respond to the communications dated 27 and 30 January 2006, 6 April 2006, 26 and 27 June 
2006 and 30 November 2006.

<p><b>Namibia 
 
</b>414. On 11 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning Ms <b>Ruusa 
Malulu</b>, Chairperson of the Committee of Ex-combatants People&#8217;s Liberation Army of Namibia 
(PLAN) and Ms <b>Lapaka Ueyulu</b>, Namibian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) reporter. 
According to the information received, during a public meeting of the South -West Africa 
People's Organization, (SWAPO) held in Windhoek on 30 July 2006, Ms Ruusa Malulu and Ms 
Lapaka Ueyulu, received death threats allegedly made by the President of SWAPO and former 
President of Namibia. Ms Malulu was threatened due to her activism and opinions expressed 
regarding the compensations&#8217; demands of the Committee of Ex combatants- PLAN she 
represents, for their contributions made during Namibian independence struggle. Reportedly, Ms 
Lapaka Ueyulu was threatened for having conducted an interview with Ms Malulu and giving 
publicity as well as credibility to her demands. It should be noted that on 24 August 2005, a 
businessman was killed under unknown circumstances. His death came within hours after media </p>

reports indicated he could have disclosed information regarding SWAPO leaders&#8217; alleged 
involvement in a social security scandal.  
 
<b>Replies from the Govenrment 
 
</b>415. By letter dated 4 December 2006, the Government of Namibia replied to the 
communication of 11 August 2006, concerning the alleged threats made against Ms Ruusa 
Malulu and Ms Lapaka Ueyulu. The Governmnet informed that they were not aware of any 
complaints made or cases lodged with the Namibian Police in this regard, and for these reasons 
there were no investigations being carried out to that effect. The Government also indicated that 
there are enforceable available remedies in their national regulations open to any citizen of 
Namibia who alleges a violation of human rights. Concerning the killing of a businessman on 24 
August 2005, the Government informed that the allegations in the communication were too 
broad to give an answer to it. It was stressed that the Government of Namibia gives serious 
attention to any killings, which are duly investigated by the Police and other law enforcement 
agencies. Finally, the Government informed that both the right of freedom of expression and the 
right to life are entrenched in the Namibian Constitution.

</b>475. On 31 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter concerning the 
incidents of the 17 March 2006 in Dutse. Reportedly, on this day, a unit of the Nigerian Police 
Force (NPF), used tear gas to disperse supporters of the Advanced Congress of Democrats 
(ACD) who were holding a meeting, on the ground that ACD had no authorisation to hold such a 
meeting. <b>Hassan Karofi, </b>a<b> </b>correspondent of the privately-owned &quot;Daily Trust&quot; newspaper in the 
northern state of Jigawa, lost consciousness as a result of the tear gas used.  ACD is a new 
opposition party formed with the aim of participating in next year's general elections. Moreover, 
on 16 March 2006, in response to a lawsuit brought by the Governor against <i>The News</i>, over a 6 </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 173 
 
February 2006 article alleging embezzlement by Government officials, the high court of Ekiti, 
forbade the newspaper to publish any &quot;negative&quot; reports about Governor Ayodele Fayose. 
Governor Fayose had demanded 25 billion nairas (&#8364;160 million) in damages and a ban on any 
further reporting on his activities by <i>The News</i>. Furthermore, on 15 March 2006, <b>Mahmud Jega, 
</b>the editor of <i>New Nigeria</i>, a government-owned weekly based in Kaduna, was fired by the 
Ministry of Information in connection with an article he wrote on 10 March 2006 headlined 
&quot;Horror: Mantu Committee Adopts Third Term,&quot; on the decision by a parliamentary panel to 
approve a constitutional amendment that would let Mr Obasanjo run for a third term next year. 
On 14 March 2006, in Port Harcourt, a unit of the State Security Services (SSS) raided a 
privately-owned radio station, <b>Rhythm 93.7 FM</b>, and arrested <b>Segun Owolabi, </b>the news editor 
in charge that day, for airing a statement made the day before by the Claims Directory of Nigeria 
(CDN), a consumer association, calling for a protest against the regular power outages. Mr 
Owolabi was detained for nearly 24 hours on charges of 'attempting to disturb the peace'. The 
SSS has raided Rhythm 93.7 FM on several previous occasions in recent months. On 14 March 
2006, at his home in Molete, <b>Dare Aleshinloye</b>, a photographer with the privately-owned daily 
&quot;The Tribune&quot;, was beaten by police and his equipment was confiscated. On 8 March 2006 in 
Lagos, <b>Sesan Olufowobi,</b> a journalist with the weekly <i>Saturday Punch</i>, was summoned and 
threatened by members of a commission created by the President to investigate a recent series of 
deadly clashes between the police and the army. Mr Olufowobi had quoted the armed forces 
chief of staff, Lieutenant General. Martin Luther Agwai, saying that the commission was 
pointless and that the two sides could sort out the problem in their own way. Mr Agwai 
reportedly denied ever saying this. 
 
476. On 18 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning four 
journalists: <b>Dare Aleshinloye</b>, photographer for the privately-owned newspaper <i>The Tribune</i>; 
<b>Dare Fasube</b>, photo journalist with the newspaper <i>Vanguard</i>, covering the national housing and 
population census exercise at the Ibadan North East Local Government Area in Oyo State, 
southwest Nigeria; <b>Emmanuel Ugwu</b>, correspondent for the newspaper <i>This Day</i>; and <b>Alfred 
Egbegi</b>, publisher of the privately-owned newspaper <i>Izon Link</i>. According to the information 
received, on 14 March 2006, Dare Akeshinloye was beaten by police and his equipment was 
seized when he was returning home. On 21 March, Dare Fasube was taking photographs of the 
long queue of census enumerators waiting for their payment. A government official, whose name 
is known as the Rapporteur, attacked Fasube upon seeing him taking photographs. He was hit 
several times, and this inflicted serious injuries on Fasube, and his camera was broken. On 24 
March, Emmanuel Ugwu received a phone call, threatening to track him down and kill him if he 
did not retract the story within two days. Prior to that, he wrote a story about an assault on census 
enumerators participating in Nigeria&#8217;s housing and population census. Ugwu has reportedly 
lodged a complaint with the State Commissioner of Police. Alfred Egbegi had also been 
receiving anonymous phone calls, threatening him with death for causing embarrassment to the 
state governor and his deputy. The phone calls followed his publishing a story critical of the state 
governor and his deputy on 10 April 2006. Concern is expressed that the assaults and threat 
against the above-mentioned journalists are directly connected to their journalistic work, 
particularly in light of the continuous reports on attacks and harassments against the media and 
journalists. 
 
477. On 20 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding Mr </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 174 
 
<b>Bukhari Bello</b>, formerly Executive Secretary of the National Human Rights Commission in 
Nigeria. According to the information received, on 19 June 2006 Mr Bukhari Bello received a 
letter from the Director of Personnel Management at the office of the Attorney- General of the 
Federation and Ministry for Justice of Nigeria stating that he was to be removed from his 
position as Executive Secretary of the National Human Rights Commission in Nigeria. The letter 
did not state the reason for his removal. According to the information received, on 17 June 2006, 
Mr Bukhari Bello had received a text message from the Attorney- General of the Federation and 
Ministry for Justice requesting that he meet with him urgently. It is reported that Mr Bukhari 
Bello went to the home of the Attorney-General in response to this request and that during the 
meeting Mr Bukhari Bello was informed that the Government was &#8220;not happy&#8221; with the position 
of the National Human Rights Commission on a number of issues. In this regard, it is alleged 
that the Attorney-General cited a statement made by Mr Bukhari Bello on 12 May 2006 at the 
thirty-ninth session of the African Commission of Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, where Mr 
Bukhari Bello criticized constitutional amendments that aimed at extending the time limits that 
incumbent presidents were permitted to serve. It is further alleged that the Attorney-General 
cited a press conference given by Mr Bukhari Bello on 7 June 2006 in which he had criticized 
law enforcement authorities for their failure to abide by court orders; a television interview given 
by Mr Bukhari Bello on 14 June 2006 to the Nigerian Television Authority, where he had 
questioned the legality of the detention of prisoners held in Guantanamo Bay, and a press release 
issued by Mr Bukhari Bello on 16 June 2006, in which he condemned the arrest and detention of 
a television journalist with African Independent Television (AIT). Mr  Bello was then reportedly 
informed by the Attorney-General that he would be removed from his position as Executive 
Secretary of the National Human Rights Commission in Nigeria and that he would receive a 
letter to this effect on 19 June 2006. Concern is expressed that the removal of Mr Bello from his 
position represents a reprisal for his critical work in the defence of human rights as the head of 
the National Human Rights Commission.  
 
478. On 28 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention sent an urgent appeal concerning <b>Rotimi Durojaiye</b>, 
correspondent for the <i>Daily Independent</i> newspaper; and <b>Mike Gbenga Aruleba</b>, presenter at a 
private TV station <i>African Independent Television</i>. According to the information received, on 12 
June 2006, Mr Durojaiye published an article on a presidential jet, implicating that there was 
fraud in the purchasing process. Mr Aruleba is a presenter for a daily show <i>Focus Nigeri</i>a. On 13

<p>480. On 30 January 2006,  the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders sent a letter of allegation 
concerning the Chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) and the 
United Nations Special Rapporteur on Religious Intolerance Ms <b>Asma Jahangir,</b> Mr <b>Afrasiab 
Khattak</b>, former HRCP Chairperson, Mr <b>Munizae Jahangir</b>, a journalist, and Mr <b>Muhammad 
Nadeem</b> a cameraman, who were conducting a fact-finding mission to investigate paramilitary 
action in Balochistan, Pakistan. According to the information received, on 8 January 2006, Ms 
Asma Jahangir and other members of HRCP were conducting a fact-finding mission to 
investigate paramilitary action in Balochistan, Pakistan. It is reported that when Asma Jahangir 
and other members of HRCP left Mulastan in a hired car, five or six intelligence agents 
photographed the car. In Dera Ghazi Khan, where the above-mentioned persons had stopped for 
a short break, they were again photographed by intelligence agents. According to information 
received, as the delegation was travelling to Sui, armed unidentified men opened fire on the 
vehicle they were travelling in. It is reported that Ms Asma Jahangir and the other members of 
HRCP reported this to the Rangers but were told that the Rangers did not have instructions to 
search for the perpetrators of the alleged incident. An application was then made to file a police 
report at the Frontier Corps Headquarters in Kashmol. On 9 January 2006, the media reported 
that the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) had claimed responsibility for the shooting 
however, it is alleged that two journalists testified that they had been pressurised by members of 
the secret services to issue the BLA statement, which did not appear to come from BLA. Grave 
concern is expressed that the above-mentioned shooting is an attempt to prevent Ms Asma 
Jahangir and other members of HRCP from investigating human rights violations in Balochistan. 
Further concern is expressed regarding the alleged pressure applied to journalists by intelligence 
agents to issue the statement from BLA.  
</p>
<p>481. On 20 February 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>Amanullah Khan</b>, 
aged 77, Chairman of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) political party. 
According to the information received, on 2 February 2006, Amanullah Khan was detained with 
other protesters in the city of Rawalpindi during a peaceful demonstration against the 
construction of the Basha Dam in the Gilgit region of the Northern Areas. He is being held at 
Adyala Prison in Rawalpindi, alongside convicted prisoners, under the Maintenance of Public 
Order Ordinance which allows the authorities to detain persons for up to three months without 
charge. Amanullah Khan has not been permitted to receive visitors. He is ill with complications 
related to high blood pressure and since his detention, his health has deteriorated, for what he 
needs medical care outside the prison. The Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front are resisting the 
construction of the Basha Dam as they believe that the Government is ignoring the local 
population&#8217;s concerns over its construction. Local leaders claim that the dam would displace 
30,000 people and flood thousands of acres of land. Concerns were expressed for his health 
which may lead to irremediable damage if he does not receive adequate medical care. Moreover, 
there was concern that he and the other protestors arrested could be detained for the peaceful 
exercise of their rights to freedom of association and freedom of expression.

482. On 7 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture, the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, 
and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning Mr <b>Naeem Mirza</b>, Mr <b>Imran Shareef</b>, Mr <b>Saeed 
Khan</b>, Mr <b>Zamurrad Balouch</b>, Mr <b>Imran Fatima</b>, Ms <b>Sadia Mumtaz</b>, members of the <i>Aurat 
Foundation</i>, and Ms <b>Farzana Bari</b>, a member of the <i>Pattan organization</i>. The <i>Aurat Foundation</i> 
and the <i>Pattan organization</i> are organizations that work to promote and defend women&#8217;s human 
rights. According to the allegations received, on 4 March 2006 the above-mentioned persons 
were arrested in Rawalpindi while on their way to a peaceful protest that had been organized by 
the Citizens Action Group to protest against the visit of the President of the United States of 
America to Pakistan. It is alleged that as they were proceeding towards the venue of the 
demonstration on Murree Road, members of the Punjab police forces manhandled them and used 
batons to beat them. It is alleged that they were taken to an unknown location. A communication 
was sent on 4 March 2006 requesting their release. The Ministry responded to the 
communication and assured that all defenders would be released. According to the information 
received, Sadia Mumtaz and Farzana Bari have been released but Naeem Mirza, Imran Shareef, 
Saeed Khan, Zamurrad Balouch and Imran Fatima remained in detention at the time this 
communication was sent. There are concerns that the human rights defenders were humiliated 
and ill-treated by police during their detention. Grave concern is expressed that the arrests, 
detentions and ill-treatment of the above-named persons are connected to their work in defence 
of human rights, particularly their participation in the above mentioned peaceful protest. 
 
483. On 20 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning <b>Hayatullah 
Khan</b>, a journalist working for the English-language daily newspaper <i>The Nation</i>, the Urdu-
language daily newspaper <i>Ausaf</i>, and the European Press-photo Agency. He is also the General 
Secretary of the Tribal Union of Journalists, a union of journalists working in the tribal areas of 
Pakistan near the Afghanistan border. According to the information received, on 1 December 
2005, there was a missile attack against a house in Haisori village, North Waziristan region. 
Hayatullah Khan subsequently published a report with photographs on the missile attack, which 
contradicted the government version of the report. On 5 December, he was on his way to report 
about a protest against the missile attack, when he was abducted in the region by a group of 
unidentified gunmen. It is reported that Hayatulla Khan had been receiving anonymous threats 
for a few months prior to the abduction, warning him not to report on the security situation in the 
area.

question of torture and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal concerning Dr. <b>Imdad Baloch</b>, Dr. <b>Yousaf Baloch</b>, 
Dr. <b>Naseem Baloch</b>, <b>Ghulam Rasool</b>, Dr, <b>Allah Nazar</b>, Dr. <b>Akhtar Nadeem</b> and Dr. <b>Ali 
Nawaz</b>, all members of <i>Balochistan Students Organization</i>. According to the information 
received, on the night of 24 to 25 March 2005, they were arrested by approximately thirty armed 
men wearing police and ranger uniforms from a private residence on Norman Avenue, Gulistan-
e-Johar, Karachi, after attending a peaceful rally against the army operation in Balochistan.  
Their whereabouts were unknown for two months. On 24 May 2005, Dr. Imdad Baloch, Dr. 
Yousaf Baloch, Dr. Naseem Baloch and Dr. Ghulam Rasool were released on bail. Dr. Imdad 
Baloch alleges that he and his fellow detainees had been detained incommunicado in solitary 
confinement for 33 days in Karachi, where they were subjected to torture and ill-treatment. He </p>

 page 177 
 
was hit on the soles of his feet making him unable to walk and beaten all over his body, 
including on his kidneys, with leather straps while forced to lie prone in fetters on the ground. 
The four detainees were then taken to Quetta, where they were kept for 22 days and threatened 
with death if they continued to participate in politics. In August 2005, Dr, Allah Nazar, Dr. 
Akhtar Nadeem and Dr. Ali Nawaz were located at a police station in a village in Punjab 
province, held on charges of robbery. Dr. Allah Nazar was transferred to Balochistan and charged 
with terrorism.  He is currently in at the Central Jail in Quetta.  As a result of the treatment he 
received, he is virtually paralysed and has lost a substantial part of his memory. Akhtar Nadeem 
and Ali Nawaz were released on 2 November 2005.  
 
485. On 12 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture, sent an urgent appeal concerning <b>Abdul Rauf Sasoli</b> and <b>Saeed Brohi</b>, both 
leaders of a Baloch political party, the Jamhoori Watan (Republican National Party). According 
to the information received, on 3 February 2006, Abdul Raof Sasoli was picked up by two 
plainclothes police officers in the Gulshan-e-Iqbal area of Karachi. The police then drove him 
away in his own car. On 10 March 2006, Saeed Brohi was picked up in Karachi. The 
whereabouts of the two men are unknown and they have not been seen or heard from since. The 
provincial police and military departments have denied having either man in their custody. 
According to the information received, a lawyer has filed a habeas corpus petition on behalf of 
the two men in the High Court. It is reported that Jamhoori Watan Party is one of a number of 
Baloch parties campaigning for the Balochistan province to be better developed, and for local 
people to be given both a bigger share of the revenue from the gas produced in the province, and 
more access to the gas itself. Since December 2005, Baloch political activists have campaigned 
over recent allegations of the unlawful killing of villagers by the army in Balochistan. 
  
486. On 12 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, 
sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>Munir Mengal</b>, Director of &quot;<i>Baloch Voice</i>&quot; TV station. 
According to the information received, on 4 April 2006, he was arrested by intelligence agents at 
Karachi airport. Immigration officials informed his relatives that he was taken away by staff of 
the Inter- Services Intelligence (ISI), which is under the control of the army. His relatives tried to 
file a complaint with the police, but had not been allowed to do so. His current whereabouts are 
unknown although his relatives believe that he may be held in the Malir Cantonment of Karachi. 
There are concerns that his arrest was linked to plans to launch a Baloch-language TV station in 
Pakistan. Munir Mengal is the director of the first independent Baloch-language satellite 
television channel. The channel is based in the United Arab Emirates and is scheduled to start 
broadcasting in June 2006. 
 
487. On 17 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur and the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on the situation of human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal concerning Mr <b>Haneef 
Ramay</b>, Secretary General of the <i>Muttahida Labour Federation</i>, Ms <b>Ghulam Fatima</b> of the 
<i>Bonded Labour Liberation Front</i> and Ms <b>Farhat Parveen</b> of the <i>Pakistan Institute of Labour 
Education and Research</i>. According to the information received, on 2 May 2006 Mr Ramay, Ms 
Fatima and Ms  Parveen, together with other workers and trade union leaders, were participating 
in a peaceful protest against bonded labour in the brick kiln industry in Pakistan in connection 
with International Labour Day. It is reported that police officers began a baton charge and beat a 
number of protestors including Mr Ramay, Ms Fatima and Ms Parveen, sustaining injuries. It is </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 178 
 
alleged that 100 protestors were arrested and that 25 of them, including Haneef Ramay and Ms 
Ghulam Fatima, have been charged under section 16 of the Maintenance of Public Order 
Ordinance, 1960. Concern was expressed that the above events are connected with the activities 
of Mr Ramay, Ms Fatima and Ms Parveen in defence of human rights, in particular because of 
their peaceful participation in the protests against bonded labour in Pakistan. 
 
488. On 26 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning <b>Mukesh 
Rupeta</b>, a correspondent with the independent television station <i>Geo TV</i>; and <b>Sanjay Kumar</b>, 
freelance cameraman. According to the information received, Mr Rupeta and Mr Kumar were 
kidnapped allegedly by the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) on 6 March 2006, while filming the 
base at Shahbaz, in Sindh province, where the United States military has its equipment and 
troops. No news was received regarding their whereabouts for three months. On 21 June, the two 
journalists were handed over to the Jacobabad police, who formally arrested them under the 
Official Secret Act on the charge of divulging official secrets. On the next day, they were taken 
before a judge in Jacobabad, who gave the police permission to hold them for another seven 
days. It is reported that Mr Rupeta and Mr Kumar had clear signs of having been tortured. Grave 
concern was expressed at the reported practice of ISI of kidnapping and torturing journalists. It is 
reported that there have been at least 21 cases of journalists kidnapped by ISI since October 
1999. 
 
489. On 26 September 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
freedom of religion or belief, sent a letter of allegation concerning <b>Sultan Dogar</b> and <b>Abdul 
Sattar Khan</b>, both employees of the Daily Alfazal, a newspaper run by the Ahmadi community, 
in Lahore. According to the allegations received, on 9 September, Chenab Nagar (Rabwah) 
police raided the offices of the Daily Alfazal, where they arrested two of the newspaper&#8217;s 
employees, Sultan Dogar, a printer and Abdul Sattar Khan, a journalist.  The two men were 
charged under article 298B (offence of a member of the Ahmadi faith misusing holy personages 
or places) and article 298C (offence of a member of the Ahmadi faith calling himself a Muslim) 
of the Pakistan Penal Code, article 16 of the Maintenance of Public Order Act and article 9 of the 
Anti-Terrorism Act. Abdul Sattar Khan was subsequently released, but Sultan Dogar is still in 
detention. According to the information received, the police had indicated that the raid was part 
of the Government&#8217;s policy of preventing the dissemination of hate literature. The charges are 
based on the articles in the newspaper which discussed Qadiyani beliefs and described Ahemdis 
as Muslims.  
 
<b>Replies from the Government

20 February 2006, informing that on 2 February 2006 Mr <b>Amanullah Khan of Jammu </b>and 
Kashmir Liberation Front was detained at Rawalpindi along with other protestors during a 
demonstration against the construction of Bhasha Dam in the Gilgit region of the Northern

that they were suspected to be involved in terrorist activities, i.e. bomb blasts and murder. For 
this reason, they were kept under preventive detention in accordance to Section 3 of the 
Maintenance of Public Order. Dr. Nazar was released due to the lack of sufficient evidence to 
file an indictment, and Mr Nadeem, on whom sufficient evidence was found, was sent to judicial 
custody for facing trial in the court at Turbat. According to the inquiry report of the Home 
Department of Balochistan, no physical or mental torture had been inflicted upon the suspects.

494. El 15 de febrero de 2006, el Relator Especial envi&#243; un llamamiento urgente en relaci&#243;n 
con el periodista de Radio Azotey, <b>Enrique Galeano</b>. De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida el 
Sr. Galeano se encontrar&#237;a desaparecido desde el d&#237;a 4 de febrero de 2006. El Sr. Galeano habr&#237;a 
sido v&#237;ctima de amenazas de muerte recientemente, como resultado de las cuales habr&#237;a tenido 
protecci&#243;n policial en su domicilio durante cinco d&#237;as durante el mes de enero de 2006. Seg&#250;n 
nuestras fuentes, estas amenazas, as&#237; como la supuesta desaparici&#243;n del Sr. Galeano, podr&#237;an 
estar asociadas a su trabajo period&#237;stico mediante el cual habr&#237;a denunciado en varias ocasiones 
actividades delictivas de autoridades de la regi&#243;n de Horqueta.  
 
495. El 9 de marzo de 2006, el Relator Especial envi&#243; una comunicaci&#243;n en relaci&#243;n con el 
periodista <b>Juan Augusto Roa</b>, corresponsal del diario <i>ABC Color</i> en Encarnaci&#243;n (Sur). De 
acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 27 de febrero de 2006, dos individuos que circulaban en 
una moto y portaban armas de fuego habr&#237;an disparado sobre el veh&#237;culo que conduc&#237;a el Sr. Roa 
entre las localidades de Mayor Ota&#241;o e Itap&#250;a. Los presuntos autores de los disparos se habr&#237;an 
dado a la fuga. Se inform&#243; que el periodista, que sali&#243; ileso de la agresi&#243;n, habr&#237;a presentado una 
denuncia en la comisar&#237;a de Yatytay, y que la polic&#237;a estar&#237;a buscando a los dos supuestos 
agresores. El Relator Especial mostr&#243; su satisfacci&#243;n por la acci&#243;n inmediata emprendida por las 
autoridades para investigar este incidente. No obstante, expres&#243; su temor a que esta agresi&#243;n 
pudiera estar relacionada con la labor period&#237;stica del Sr. Roa, en concreto con sus 
investigaciones sobre el tr&#225;fico de drogas, robo de coches y corrupci&#243;n local en la regi&#243;n.  
 
496. El 20 de julio de 2006, el Relator Especial envi&#243; un llamamiento urgente en relaci&#243;n con el

2006 el Sr. Ruiz D&#237;az habr&#237;a recibido amenazas a trav&#233;s de un mensaje de texto an&#243;nimo. Este 
ser&#237;a el tercer mensaje de este tipo que habr&#237;a recibido desde el comienzo de su trabajo 
informativo acerca del tr&#225;fico de drogas en la ciudad de Pedro Juan Caballero y la publicaci&#243;n de 
una lista con los nombres de los supuestos narcotraficantes. As&#237;, el 19 de junio el Sr. Ruiz D&#237;az 
habr&#237;a recibido por primera vez un mensaje intimidatorio, al cual sigui&#243; uno similar al cabo de 
unos d&#237;as. Tales amenazas, denunciadas por el Sr. Ruiz D&#237;az el 17 de julio de 2006, podr&#237;an estar 
vinculadas a la tensa situaci&#243;n que actualmente se vive en la zona norte de Paraguay fronteriza 
con Brasil, donde el trabajo informativo sobre el tr&#225;fico de drogas en la zona habr&#237;a provocado 
tambi&#233;n la desaparici&#243;n del periodista Enrique Galeano, que ya fue objeto de llamamiento 
urgente del Relator Especial el 15 de febrero de 2006 (llamamiento al que el Gobierno del 
Paraguay respondi&#243; el 27 de febrero de 2006). El Relator Especial expres&#243; su temor a que estas 
amenazas pudieran estar relacionadas con la labor period&#237;stica del Sr. Ruiz D&#237;az, y en concreto 
con sus investigaciones sobre el tr&#225;fico de drogas en la zona.  
 
497. El 25 de julio de 2006, el Relator Especial envi&#243; una comunicaci&#243;n en relaci&#243;n con <b>Lu&#237;s 
Mart&#237;nez, Zacar&#237;as Vega </b>y <b>Daniel Romero Bord&#243;n</b>, l&#237;deres de la Comunidad de San Jos&#233; del 
Norte, en el departamento de San Pedro. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 11 de julio de 2006 
Luis Mart&#237;nez y Zacar&#237;as Vega habr&#237;an sido increpados en su camino hacia San Jos&#233; del Norte 
por miembros de las Comisiones Vecinales de Seguridad (patrullas civiles armadas), quienes les 
habr&#237;an disparado tras peguntarles hacia d&#243;nde se dirig&#237;an. Lu&#237;s Mart&#237;nez habr&#237;a resultado 
muerto con motivo de este suceso, mientras que Zacar&#237;as Vega habr&#237;a logrado escapar tras 
resultar herido. El d&#237;a siguiente a estos acontecimientos, Daniel Romero Bord&#243;n y familiares de 
Lu&#237;s Mart&#237;nez hab&#237;an recibido amenazas a causa de las investigaciones que estaban llevando a 
cabo en torno a la muerte de este &#250;ltimo. El 13 de julio de 2006, la esposa de Lu&#237;s Mart&#237;nez y el 
Sr. Romero Bord&#243;n habr&#237;an presentado una denuncia a la fiscal&#237;a del distrito, en la que se 
solicitaba una investigaci&#243;n sobre estos hechos. El mismo d&#237;a, la Coordinadora de Derechos 
Humanos del Paraguay (CODEHUPY) habr&#237;a presentado h&#225;beas corpus por el que se solicitaba 
protecci&#243;n para el Sr. Romero Bord&#243;n y su familia. Seg&#250;n esta misma informaci&#243;n, no existir&#237;a 
constancia de una protecci&#243;n adecuada por parte de las autoridades para que los l&#237;deres de esta 
comunidad puedan desempe&#241;ar leg&#237;timamente sus actividades sin miedo a ser amenazados o que 
se atente contra ellos y contra sus familiares. El Relator Especial teme que los acontecimientos 
descritos puedan estar relacionados con las labores de difusi&#243;n de informaci&#243;n que el Sr. 
Mart&#237;nez desarrollaba como l&#237;der comunitario, y en concreto con sus protestas referentes a los 
derechos de los campesinos y a sus campa&#241;as contra el uso excesivo de pesticidas, as&#237; como a su 
oposici&#243;n al uso de armas por parte de patrullas civiles en la zona.  
 
498. El 29 de septiembre de 2006, el Relator Especial envi&#243; una comunicaci&#243;n en relaci&#243;n con 
la situaci&#243;n  del periodista <b>Carlos Dogliani Staricco</b>. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 18 de 
septiembre de 2006 Carlos Dogliani Staricco, periodista del semanario local <i>El Regional</i>, fue 
condenado a cinco meses de prisi&#243;n por la Corte Suprema de Justicia de Uruguay acusado de 
cuatro delitos de difamaci&#243;n. En diciembre de 2004, el Sr. Dogliani fue condenado a cinco meses 
de prisi&#243;n por la juez local de Paysand&#250; por estos mismos delitos. Sin embargo, en julio de 2005 
un tribunal de apelaciones revoc&#243; de manera un&#225;nime esta sentencia, la cual acaba de ser 
restituida por la Corte Suprema. Los delitos de difamaci&#243;n se deben a la publicaci&#243;n de una serie 
de art&#237;culos en los que el Sr. Dogliani acusaba a un funcionario local de haber condonado gran 
parte de la deuda tributaria de un contribuyente.

encontrar&#237;a hoy sometido a procesos penales por supuestos delitos contra el honor de conocidos 
exponentes de la dictadura de Alfredo Stroessner: el ex comisario Rolando Alum e Hir&#225;n

importantes contribuciones para el esclarecimiento de los cr&#237;menes cometidos durante el r&#233;gimen 
de Alfredo Stroessner con el hallazgo de los archivos de la Polic&#237;a Pol&#237;tica de la dictadura militar 
de Alfredo Stroessner. Desde que descubri&#243; estos archivos, Mart&#237;n Almada  promovi&#243; querella 
criminal contra Alfredo Stroessner, Sabino A. Montanaro &#8212;ex Ministro del Interior&#8212; y Pastor 
Coronel &#8212;ex Jefe de la Policia Politica&#8212;, y pidi&#243; a la justicia paraguaya la investigaci&#243;n del 
Operativo C&#243;ndor, pacto entre los militares de Argentina, Brasil, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay y 
Uruguay. En el a&#241;o 2000, comenz&#243; el hostigamiento judicial de Mart&#237;n Almada por sus 
comentarios hechos a la prensa sobre la corrupta gesti&#243;n de , Magno Ferreira Falcon, 
administrador durante la dictadura de la empresa binacional Yacyreta (Argentina/Paraguay). En 
octubre de 2003, Mart&#237;n Almada trat&#243; de &quot;torturador&quot; al Comisario Rolando Agustin Alum, 
quien le promovi&#243; una querella criminal por difamaci&#243;n y calumnia. En los archivos, Mart&#237;n 
Almada encontr&#243; las pruebas que se&#241;alaban al Comisario Alum como responsable de torturas, 
que fueron presentadas al Juzgado de Liquidaci&#243;n y Sentencia que absolvi&#243; a Mart&#237;n Almada en 
el 2005. Pero la C&#225;mara de Apelaci&#243;n anulo la decisi&#243;n y ordeno reiniciar el juicio. Tambi&#233;n, en 
agosto de 2006, Mart&#237;n Almada declar&#243; a la prensa que la herencia de la dictadura era la 
corrupci&#243;n y la impunidad, y que los c&#243;mplices y encubridores del dictador deb&#237;an ser juzgados 
y remitidos a la Penitenciaria Nacional. El ex Presidente de la Corte Suprema de Justicia, Hiram 
Delgado von Leppel, se di&#243; por aludido y promovi&#243; una querella criminal por difamaci&#243;n y 
calumnia en contra de Mart&#237;n Almada, por haberle herido en su honor. La primera audiencia de 
conciliaci&#243;n estar&#237;a fijada para el lunes 27 de noviembre. En este contexto, se expresa temor que 
las querellas criminales presentadas en contra de Mart&#237;n Almada tengan el prop&#243;sito de 
disuadirlo en el ejercicio legitimo de su libertad de expresi&#243;n y de sus actividades de abogado y 
defensor de los derechos humanos.

supuesta agresi&#243;n sufrida por la periodista <b>Karina Ch&#225;vez</b> por parte de seguidores de un

periodista <b>Maril&#250; Gambini</b>, directora del programa <i>Confidencial</i> del Canal 31 de televisi&#243;n. De 
acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 5 de abril de 2006 la Sra. Gambini abandon&#243; el pa&#237;s con 
sus dos hijos tras ser amenazada de muerte por individuos a&#250;n sin identificar. Seg&#250;n se informa, 
el 28 de marzo de 2006 la periodista habr&#237;a recibido una llamada telef&#243;nica en la cual una mujer 
desconocida le habr&#237;a asegurado que le quedaba una semana de vida y le habr&#237;a advertido que se 
preocupara por sus hijos. Se alega que la Sra. Gambini habr&#237;a sido anteriormente v&#237;ctima de dos 
robos cometidos en marzo y mayo del 2005, durante los cuales unos desconocidos habr&#237;an 
allanado el domicilio de la periodista y sustra&#237;do diversos documentos y videos relacionados con 
investigaciones sobre el narcotr&#225;fico. El Relator Especial expres&#243; su temor a que estas acciones 
est&#233;n relacionadas con la labor period&#237;stica de la Sra. Gambini, en particular con sus informes 
sobre la presunta influencia de narcotraficantes en la pol&#237;tica peruana. 
 
507. El 29 de mayo de 2006, el Relator Especial, conjuntamente con la Representante Especial 
del Secretario General sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos envi&#243; un 
llamamiento urgente en relaci&#243;n al <b>Centro de Asesora Laboral</b> (CEDAL), una organizaci&#243;n

declarado p&#250;blicamente la posibilidad de recurrir al art&#237;culo 96 del C&#243;digo Civil en contra del

disoluci&#243;n de la asociaci&#243;n cuyas actividades o fines sean o resulten contrarios al orden publico o 
a las buenas costumbres.&#8221; Seg&#250;n se informa, estas declaraciones habr&#237;an ocurrido tras una tele-
conferencia de prensa el 12 de abril de 2006, durante la cual integrantes del CEDAL habr&#237;an 
llamado la atenci&#243;n acerca de los impactos negativos del Tratado de Libre Comercio (TLC) entre 
los Estados Unidos y Per&#250; en materia de derechos humanos. Seg&#250;n las informaciones la APCI 
tambi&#233;n habr&#237;a acusado al CEDAL de desviar donaciones extranjeras para financiar una 
campana en contra del TLC.  Se expres&#243; temor a que estos eventos pudieran estar relacionados 
con el trabajo que hace el CEDAL en defensa de los derechos econ&#243;micos y sociales de los 
ciudadanos de Per&#250;, y que las supuestas acciones llevadas a cabo por la APCI puedan ser un 
intento de minar la labor que hace el CEDAL en defensa de los derechos humanos.

513. On 1 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning the newspaper 
<b><i>The Daily Tribune</i></b> . According to the information received, on 24 February, President Arroyo 
had declared a national state of emergency, following an alleged coup plot against her 
Government. On the following day, the police conducted a raid of the editorial office and 
printing press of <i>The Daily Tribune</i>, reportedly without presenting a warrant. The police 
confiscated copies of the newspaper and other documents. Later on the same day, the head of the 
national police announced the temporary &#8220;takeover&#8221; of <i>The Daily Tribune</i> at a news conference. 
The police had been constantly present at the editorial office of <i>The Daily Tribune</i> since the raid. 
Concern was expressed that the raid may have been conducted in an attempt to prevent <i>The 
Daily Tribune </i>from publishing news critical of the Government. Concern was heightened in light 
of a report that the National Telecommunications Commission had stated that the Government 
reserved the right to close down or take over any media networks, if they did not comply with 
the rules on media coverage, set by the Government. 
 
514. On 26 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with th Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegation regarding Mr <b>Elpidio de la 
Victoria</b>, an environmental lawyer and programme director of the Cebu City Bantay Dagat 
Commission, and his colleague Mr <b>Antonio Oposa</b>, an environmental lawyer and leader of the 
Visayan Seas Squadron. The Cebu City Bantay Dagat Commission and the Visayan Seas 
Squadron are organizations that oppose illegal commercial fishing and campaign against the 
environmental degradation in the Visayan Sea Marine Triangle. According to the information 
received, on 12 April 2006 Mr Elpidio de la Victoria was shot in the back of the head by an 
unknown gunman, as he was leaving his house in Barrangay Dauis, Talisay City. It is reported 
that Mr Elpidio de la Victoria was taken to hospital, where he died on 13 April 2006 as a result 
of his injuries. It was further reported that a police officer had been arrested in connection with 
this killing. It was alleged that in the weeks prior to his killing, Mr Elpidio de la Victoria had 
reported to friends and relatives that those opposed to his and Mr Antonio Oposa&#8217;s work had 
raised 1 million pesos to kill them both. It is also reported that Mr Antonio Oposa had received 
serious death threats in recent weeks. Grave concern was expressed that the killing of Mr Elpidio 
de la Victoria and the threats against Mr Antonio Oposa may have been connected to their work 
in defence of the environment in particular because of work to protect coral reefs in the Visayan 
Sea Marine Triangle from illegal fishing and environmental degradation. Further concern was 
expressed that the life of Mr Antonio Oposa may be in immediate danger. 
 
515. On 31 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning <b>Paul 
Manaog</b>, president of the Camarines Sur Capitol Press Association and reporter for the local 
radio station <i>DWLL</i>; <b>Albert Orsolino</b>, photojournalist with <i>Saksi Ngayon</i> daily newspaper and 
former president of Camanava Press Corps;<b> Iring Maranan</b>, columnist for the tabloid <i>Ratsada 
Balita</i> and host of the local television programme <i>Sapul, Walang Sablay</i> on the cable network in 
San Pablo; and <b>Fernando Batul</b>, commentator for the radio station <i>DYPR</i>. According to the 
information received, on 6 May 2006, Paul Manaog was shot by unidentified gunmen, and 
seriously wounded in the central city of Naga, Camarines Sur Province. It was reported that he 
was in a critical condition in a local hospital. Reports indicated that the motive of the attack may 
have been linked to Paul Manaog's critical reporting about local political figures. On 16 May, </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 186 
 
Albert Orsolino was ambushed and shot dead by unidentified men in Caloocan City, north of 
Manila. The reason for his murder is unknown. On the same day, Iring Manaog was violently 
attacked by a San Pablo City Councillor inside the San Pablo city hall building. It is reported that 
Iring Maranan had been receiving threats in relation with his open criticism against alleged 
anomalies at the local government. Furthermore, on 22 May 2006, Fernando Batul was shot dead 
by unidentified gunmen, on the way to work in Puerto Princesa on Palawan Island. Prior to his 
murder, he broadcasted on a case of illegal recruitment of workers, in which local government 
officials were implicated to be involved.  Grave concern was expressed that the attacks against 
the above-mentioned journalists may have been linked to their work, particularly in light of the 
information indicating that at least some of them had reported on sensitive issues involving local 
government officials.  
 
516. On 19 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, sent an allegation letter concerning Ms <b>Elisa Tita Lubi</b>, a 
pro- democracy activist, member of the Board of Trustees of SELDA, an organization of former 
political prisoners, a participant in the Program and Management Committee and Regional 
Council of the Asia-Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development (APWLD) and former 
Coordinator of the GABRIELA Commission on Women&#8217;s Rights. SELDA is a member 
organization of the National Alliance for the Advancement of People&#8217;s Rights National Alliance 
for the Advancement of People&#8217;s Rights (KARAPATAN). According to the information 
received, the Ministry of Justice of the Philippines was currently seeking a court order for an 
arrest warrant to be issued for Ms Elisa Tita Lubi, together with 48 other individuals, based on 
the charges of rebellion/insurrection under articles 134 and 135 of the Revised Penal Code, 
allegedly because of Ms Lubi&#8217;s pro democracy activities and her open criticism against the 
Government. It is reported that on 4 May 2006, the judge of the Makati Regional Trial Court 
(RTC) dismissed the charges against Ms Lubi. It is further reported that the Department of 
Justice filed a motion against this judgement on the grounds that the judge had not acted 
impartially and that a new judge was assigned to the case of Ms Lubi. According to the 
information received, the case will be heard again on 21 June 2006. Concern was expressed that 
the charges may have been related to Ms Lubi&#8217;s legitimate activities in defence of human rights, 
in particular because of her pro-democracy activities.  
 
517. On 23 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning <b>George 
Vigo</b>,a frequent contributor to <i>Union of Catholic Asian News (UCAN) </i>and presenter on radio 
dxND; and his wife <b>Macel Alave-Vigo</b>, presenter of a programme on radio <i>dxND</i>. They were 
also known for having helped create the Federation of Reporters for Empowerment and Equality 
(FREE).According to the information received, on 19 June 2006, Mr Vigo and Mrs Alave-Vigo 
were shot by two unidentified gunmen near their home in Kidapawan on the southern island of 
Mindanao and died at the hospital.  Concern was expressed that the attack against Mr Vigo and 
Mrs Alave-Vigo was directly linked to their journalistic activities. 
 
518. On 4 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning Mr <b>Crispin 
Beltran</b>, Mr <b>Saturnino C. Ocampo</b>, Mr <b>Teodoro A. Casino</b>, Mr <b>Joel G. Virador</b>, Mr <b>Rafael 
V. Mariano</b> and Ms <b>Liza L. Maza</b>, members of the House of Representatives (HOR) of the 
Philippines Congress representing three opposition parties Bayan Muna Party, Anakpawis Party 
and Gabriela Women's Party. They are collectively known as &quot;Batasan 6&quot;. According to the </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 187 
 
information received, on 25 February 2006, police arrested Mr Beltran based on a 21-year-old 
arrest warrant, which was issued during the martial law regime. He was subsequently charged for 
rebellion, and remains in custody to date. On the same day, police made an attempt to arrest Mr 
Ocampo without showing him his arrest warrant, after he spoke at the press conference held by 
the opposition bloc of the House of Representatives. Following those events, Mr Ocampo, Mr 
Casino, Mr Virador, Mr Mariano and Ms Maza sought the protective custody of HOR on 27 
February and on 1 March. In this relation, the Senate passed a resolution stating that the rights 
under the Constitution and existing law should be upheld and that the Congress must continue to 
extend protection to Mr Ocampo, Mr Casino, Mr Virador, Mr Mariano and Ms Maza. Since then, 
the judiciary and the police have made several attempts to charge the five representatives of 
rebellion, especially when they decided to leave the protective custody. Despite their recourse to 
the Supreme Court against the charges brought against them, their freedom of movement and 
expression is gravely restricted, which appears to be a violation aggravated by the fact that the 
&#8220;Batasan 6&#8221; are elected members of HOR. Reports also indicate that Mr Ocampo's travels 
outside the Philippines were blocked by the Department of Justice on three different occasions. 
The members of &quot;Batasan 6&quot; have been openly requesting thorough investigation into the 
allegation that the President may have been involved in electoral fraud during the 2004 
presidential elections. They have also been openly critical about the Government's policy on 
different issues, including the division between the rich and the poor, land reform and the 
conflict between the government and the National Democratic Front. 
 
519. On 5 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning a community 
radio station, <b>Radyo Cagayano</b>. According to the information received, on 2 July 2006, several 
masked and armed men raided and torched Radyo Cagayano, in Cagayan province. Six members 
of the radio's staff, including the station's director, Susan Mapa, who were on the premises at the 
time, were able to leave the radio station. They were only slightly injured in spite of an attempt 
by the raiders to handcuff them before setting fire to the building. According to information 
received, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines has allegedly accused the Army, 
often criticized in Radyo Cagayano&#8217;s programs, of carrying out this raid. The National Union of 
Journalists of the Philippines has also condemned inaction by the police at the time of the attack. 
 
520. On 12 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegation 
concerning Mr <b>Wilfredo Cornea</b>, leader of the Mulawin Lanatan Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries 
Association (MULARBA), an organisation that works in defence of the economic rights of rural 
workers, Mr <b>Eladio Dasi-An</b>, a volunteer with the Alliance for the Advancement of People's 
Rights (KARAPATAN), Mr <b>Tito Marata</b>, provincial officer of the Rural Missionaries of the 
Philippines and a member of the Farmers for Agrarian Reform Movement, Mr <b>George Vigo</b>, 
project officer of the Mindanao Youth Leadership Program of the Community and Family

land reform. According to the information received, on 17 May 2006 Mr Mario Domingo was 
shot and killed in the Hacienda Cambuktot, la Castellana, allegedly by armed employees of a 
former landowner whose land had been redistributed to a number of farmers by the Department 
of Agrarian Reform. On 17 June 2006 Mr Tito Marata was shot dead by a gunman in Loboc 
village, Oroquieta City. On 19 June 2006, Mr George Vigo and Ms Maricel Vigo were shot and 
killed by two armed masked men in Mindanao province. On 20 June 2006 Mr Eladio Dasi-An 
was killed by two unknown men as he was travelling home in Barangay Malusay. On 26 June 
2006, Mr Wilfredo Cornea was shot by two unidentified men at his home in Hacienda Sagay. 
Grave concerns were expressed that the killings of Mr Mario Domingo, Mr Eladio Dasi-An, Mr 
Wilfredo Cornea and Mr Tito Marata are connected with their activities in defence of the human 
rights of rural workers, in particular because of their advocacy for land reform in the Philippines. 
Further concerns were expressed that the killings of Mr George Vigo and Ms Maricel Vigo were 
connected with their defence of the right to freedom of expression and opinion in the Philippines.  
 
521. On 12 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a joint letter of allegation 
concerning <b>the death of 10 journalists</b>, whose cases had not been solved or had been solved 
only partially. <b>Edgar Damalerio</b>, a radio commentator for DXKP-Pagadian, managing editor of 
the &quot;Zamboanga Scribe&quot;, and host of the cable TV program &quot;Enkwentro&quot; (Encounter), was 
gunned down on 13 May 2002 in Pagadian. Reportedly the killer received  a long prison 
sentence on 29 November 2005, but there are allegations that no investigations had been 
conducted with regard to the instigation or involvement of third persons in the crime; the latter 
being particularly relevant in the context of Pagadian, where several killings of journalists have 
taken place in recent years. <b>Edgar Amoro</b>, a journalist, was murdered on 2 February 2005 in 
Pagadian. Reportedly, arrest warrants had been issued for the two suspects, who were not 
detained at the time the communication was sent. <b>Rolly Ca&#241;ete</b>, a radio journalist was murdered 
in Pagadian on 20 January 2006. <b>Marlene Esperat</b>, a journalist and anti-corruption activist was 
murdered on March 2005. According to the information received, the trial of the alleged 
perpetrator is ongoing, though investigations on the presumed instigators had been disrupted. 
<b>George Benaojan</b>, a radio journalist who had survived an ambush on August 2004, was shot 
dead in December 2005. <b>Rolando &#8220;Dodong&#8221; Morales</b>, a radio journalist for DXMD, was 
brutally killed on 3 July 2005 in Polomolok. This killing was the subject of a previous 
communication on 6 July 2005, (AL PHL 14/2005), on which he had  received two replies from 
the Government on on 19 October and 12 January 2006. <b>Armando Pace</b>, the host of a program 
on local radio station DXDS, who had often been threatened for his criticism of local politicians 
and drug trafficking, was gunned down on 18 July 2006 in Digo, Mindanao. Reportedly, the 
murderers have not been identified. <b>George Vigo</b>, a contributor to the Union of Catholic Asian 
News (UCAN), a news agency, and his wife, Maricel Vigo, the host of a program on radio 
DXND, who were both also human rights activists, were murdered on 19 June 2006 in 
Kidapawan. <b>Ely Binoya</b>, a Radyo Natin political commentator, who was reportedly outspoken in 
his criticism of corruption in the local elite, was gunned down by two men as he was returning 
home on 17 June 2004 in the southern city of Malongon. 
 
522. On 17 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning, <b>Roger 
Panizal</b>, a reporter of the Newspaper <i>TikTid</i>, who was seriously injured after being shot three 
times. Allegedly, the victim had identified the alleged perpetrator, who was accompanied by two 
accomplices. Since 1 of August 2006, <b>Hazel Gup-ay</b>, a local public radio station presenter in </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 189 
 
Tabuk, had been receiving death threats, reportedly, due to her reporting on an ambush against a 
left-wing activist and her criticism of the local authorities.  
 
523. On 25 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning <b>Angelo 
Gavarra, Manolito Gertes, Joseph Alicabo, Ricky Bindol, Rommel Mariano</b> and <b>Jun 
Torres</b>, trade union workers members of Toyota Motor Corporation Philippines Workers 
Association (TMCPWA). Allegedly they were injured in a serious manner, by police and security 
guards while submitting a petition concerning a labor union case at the Department of Labor and 
Employment office in Intramuros, Manila. Later on the same day, 21 TMCPWA members, 
including the six injured, were charged of inciting to sedition, trespassing, damages to properties 
and physical injuries. According to information received, the Department of Labor and 
Employment discarded an earlier application concerning TMCPWA as a legally recognized trade 
union, preferring instead to support the application of another trade union, in spite of a decision 
of the Supreme Court of the Philippines favorable to TMCPWA. 
 
524. On 5 September 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning <b>Raffy 
Tulfo</b>, a columnist of &quot;Abante Tonite&quot; newspaper and part-time television broadcaster. 
According to the information received, on 31 of July 2006, the Court of Appeals confirmed the 
conviction on 14 counts of libel of Mr Tulfo. He was sentenced to 32 years and eight months 
imprisonment plus a fine of over US$285,000. Reportedly, the counts of libel were related to 
several articles he had written nearly a decade ago about a customs officer. In its 31 July 2006 
decision, the Court of Appeals stated that the prosecution had successfully proven that Tulfo's 
stories were written in reckless disregard as to its truth. 
 
525. On 14 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of Human Rights Defenders, sent an urgent appeal 
concerning death threats against <b>Father Rolando de Leon</b>, a Roman Catholic Priest of the 
Diocese of Malolos, Bulacan and Parish Priest of San Andres Apostol Parish, Norzagaray, and 
spokesperson for the Catholic Church&#8217;s provincial human rights office in Bulacan&#8217;s capital of 
Malolos. Fr Rolando de Leon was the subject of a joint communication addressed to the 
Government on 2 December 2005. According to the new information received, Fr de Leon has 
repeatedly been subjected to acts of intimidation and death threats since October 2005 when he 
received envelopes containing M-16 bullets. It is reported that during a series of meetings held 
by members of the military in Bulacan Province between January and October 2006, Fr de Leon 
was accused of membership of the New People&#8217;s Army. Previously, in December 2005, he was 
reportedly depicted in posters displayed in the main public square of Norzagaray and its 
immediate environs, wearing a robe with the logos of the Communist Party of the Philippines 
and the New People&#8217;s Army. Furthermore, in March 2006, General Jovito Palparan Jr, the 
former military commander of the region, reportedly stated in local newspaper <i>Balita</i> that Fr 
Rolando de Leon &#8220;cannot be trusted because he is a liar&#8221;.  This statement was apparently made 
in response to comments Fr de Leon had made at a press conference in relation to human rights 
violations in Bulacan Province which had been documented by the aforementioned human rights 
office in Malolos. It is also reported that uniformed soldiers have repeatedly visited the church 
asking for Fr de Leon without giving a reason for their presence. According to sources, armed 
soldiers also remain in the church&#8217;s courtyard on occasion. Concern was expressed for the safety 
and security of Fr Rolando de Leon as it was feared that the sustained campaign of hostility 
against him, represented an attempt by the military, to deter him from carrying out his legitimate </p>

activities in defence of human rights, in particular his work in documenting and raising 
awareness of human rights violations in the Bulacan Province. 
 
<b>Replies from the Government 
 
</b>526. By letter dated 3 August 2006, the Government of Philippines replied to the 
communication of 31 May 2006 concerning some reported attacks on journalists. As to Mr 
<b>Alberto Orsolino</b>, the Government informed that on 16 May 2006, he was ambushed by two 
motorcycle-riding men who shot Mr Orsolino causing his instantaneous death. The Police 
indicated that one of the suspects, Franklin Sabe, has been harbouring ill-feelings against the 
victim due to the killing of Franklin&#8217;s brother on 18 May 2005. The Sabe family suspected that 
Mr Orsolino was the mastermind of Franklin&#8217;s brother killing and a complaint of murder was 
filed against him, although dismissed later on for lack of evidence. The Government also 
informed that on 26 May 2006, Police filed a case of murder before the Department of Justice 
against the suspects Franklin Sabe, Roland Manaug and the alleged gunman Rommel C. Lizaran. 
Concerning the journalist <b>Ireneo Dumanog</b>, alias Ering Maranan, the Government indicated that 
on 16 May 2006 he was kicked once on his thigh and choked on the neck by San Pablo City 
Councilor Edgardo Adajar while the City Council was in session. Mr Maranan filed cases of 
coercion and dereliction of duty against Councilor Adajar at the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. The 
Government also reported the situation of journalist Fernando Batul, who, according to police 
investigations, was shot dead on 22 May 2006. Two days after this Police Officer Aaron 
Madamay was arrested and a case of murder was filed against him. This suspect is now detained 
in jail and insvestigation is still continuing to unveil the other perpetrator. Finally, the 
Government informed that there is no record of any incident against Mr Paul Manaog, and that 
the case is still being verified.  
 
527. By letter dated 20 October 2006, the Government of the Philippines replied to the 
communication of 31 May 2006 concerning the journalist <b>Mr Paul Manaog</b>. Based on the 
investigation by the Police, the Government informed that Mr Manaog and his wife were inside a 
bistrot at Villa Caceres Hotel when one of the five suspects confronted him. It was also reported 
by the Government that without any apparent reason the suspects mauled and shot Mr Manaog 
when he decided to leave the hotel with his wife. The Government informed that gun shot 
wounds caused his death.  
 
528. By letter dated 28 August 2006, the Government replied to the communication of 19 June 
2006, stating that a complaint against <b>Ms Lubi</b> and <b>other individuals</b> for the crime of rebellion 
is pending consideration before the trial court. The Government indicated that the usual domestic 
procedure begins with a police investigation of the case, then a criminal complaint is filed 
against the person who was found by the police to have committed the offense and the complaint 
is then filed before the municipal/city prosecutor&#8217;s office (of the Department of Justice). The 
Government&#8217;s reply explained in its entirety the whole criminal procedure according to 
Philippine's regulations. In the present case, the Directorate for Investigationa and Detective 
Management of the Philippine National Police (PNP) conducted an investigation of several 
individuals suspected of committing the continuing crime of rebellion. The offence of rebellion 
is punishable under articles 134 and 135 of the Revised Penal Code. In the Philippine 
jurisprudence, the crime of rebellion is by its nature a crime of a multitude, a vast movement of 
men and complex net of intrigues and plots. In committing the offence, participation by the </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 191 
 
offender in the actual clash of arms with government forces is not absolutely necessary. The 
mere fact that a person knowingly identifies himself with an organization which is openly 
fighting to overthrow the Government is enough to make him liable for rebellion. In the case at 
hand, it appears that following police investigation, PNP instituted a complaint for rebellion 
against Jose Ma. Sison and 50 other individuals, including Ms Tita Lubi, before the National 
Prosecution Service of the Department of Justice (DOJ). The complaint was docketed as I.S 06-
225. The charges against Ms Lubi and her co respondents were based on the results of the 
preliminary investigation conducted by the prosecutors pursuant to their legally-mandated 
functions and reflected in their findings and resolutions which are in accord with the law, 
evidence, and established jurisprudence on the matter. When asked about submitting the written 
responses to the charge, Ms Tita Lubi chose not to participate in the preliminary investigation 
and did not answer the complaint against her. DOJ found probable cause against the respondents, 
including Ms Lubi, for the crime charged. Criminal information for rebellion was thereafter 
instituted against the respondents before the Regional Trial Court of Makati (RTC). About the 
same time, it appears that another case for rebellion was also being instituted against 14 
individuals by DOJ. The complaint was docketed as I.S No. 06-226 and is separate and distinct 
from the complaint instituted against Ms Lubi. It appears, however that his case was also raffled 
to Branch 137 of the RTC Makati City presided by Judge Delorino and was docketed as 
Criminal Case No. 06-452. Subsequently, following the conduct of prelimary investigation in IS. 
No 06-226, it was discovered by DOJ that the respondents in IS. No. 06-225, and in IS. No. 06-
226 were guilty of the same act of rebellion. Hence, DOJ sought to amend the criminal 
information filed in Criminal Case No. 06-452(which stemmed from the complaint subject of IS 
No 06-226) by including those respondents in I.S. No. 06-225. After the accused in a criminal 
case has entered his plea, an amendment of the information against him can only be made with 
leave of court. In the instant case, DOJ sought the permission of Judge Delorino to amend the 
information filed in Criminal Case No 06-452 against the 14 individuals. By amending the 
information in Criminal Case No. 06-452, DOJ would have had included the 50 other individuals 
subject of IS No. 06-225 in this case (criminal case NO. 06-452). Judge Delorino however 
denied DOJ&#8217;s plea. After the denial of its plea to have information in Criminal Case No. 06-452 
amended, DOJ filed a motion for the inhibition of Judge Delorino. Judge Delorino voluntarily 
inhibited herself from hearing Criminal Case No. 06-452. Judge Delorino also issued an order 
inhibiting herself from hearing the criminal case which stemmed from IS No. 06-225 filed 
against the 50 individuals which include Ms Tita Lubi. 
 
529. By letter dated 17 August 2006, the Government of Philippines replied to the 
communication of 23 June 2006 regarding the case of <b>George Vigo</b> and his wife <b>Maricel Alave-
Vigo</b>. The Government indicated that Mr George Vigo was a block timer radio commentator, an 
active member of a movement for Lumad muslim and christian youth, a project officer of an 
NGO and a former correspondent of the Union of Catholic Asian News (UCAN). It was also 
reported that Ms Mariciel Alave-Vigo was the co-anchor of a radio program and a secretary of 
Congresswoman Emily Talino Santos of the 1st District of Cotabato Province. The Government 
informed that the victims were shot to death on 19 June 2006 by two unidentified men riding a 
motorcycle. The Government indicated that the motive for the killing is revenge; in November 
2004 George Vigo attended a media dialogue with Commander Benjie of the New People&#8217;s 
Army (NPA) in Makilala. During the dialogue, the Philippine Army raided the area that resulted 
in the killing of Commander Benjie. Since then, the Communist Party of the Philippines-New 
People&#8217;s Army (CPP-NPA) doubted the loyalty of George Vigo. The Government also informed </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 192 
 
that a case with IS Number 2006F-268 had been filed against suspects Junever Madaguit a.k.a. 
Jek-Jek, Juning, Dionisio and Bobong, an active member of CPP-NPA Guerilla Front 51, North 
Cotabato, and three other John Does. 
 
530. By letter dated 20 October 2006, the Government of the Philippines replied to the 
communication of 5 July 2006 concerning the case of <b>Radyo Cagayano</b>. The Government 
informed that, based on the report submitted by the Regional Intelligence and Investigation 
Division-Police Regional Office 2, on 2 July 2006 the Community Police Action Center 
(COMPAC) received a call informing that a fire incident was in progress a Radyo Cagayano. 
According to the Government&#8217;s reply, eight unidentified armed men attacked the radio station, 
held all the employees inside, and took their cell phones. One of the armed men set the building 
on fire with the use of an unknown substance. The Government indicated that one of the victims, 
Mr Richard Ayudan, claimed that the armed men were wearing military watches, leading them to 
conclude that the perpetrators were members of the Philippine Army. The Government informed 
that the Baggao Police Station was continuing its efforts to identify the perpetrators, despite the 
reluctance and disinterest of the victims to pursue the case.  
 
531. By letters dated 23 August 2006, 29 August 2006 and 20 October 2006 the Government of 
Philippines replied to the communication of 17 August 2006 regarding the case of <b>Mr Roger 
Panizal</b> and <b>Ms Hazel Gup-ay</b>. The Government informed that in a report submitted by the 
Philippine National Police (PNP) based on their investigation, on 14 August 2006, Mr Roger 
Panizal, a tricycle driver, was attacked along Juliana Sreet, in Malinta, Venezuela. Two suspects 
in the incidents have been identified, while two others are still at large. The Government 
informed that police are still conducting further investigation on the case.  
 
532. By letter dated 31 October 2006, the Government of the Philippines replied to the 
communication of 17 August 2006 regarding the case of <b>Ms Hazel Gup-ay</b>. The Government 
informed that on 1 and 7 August 2006, Ms Hazel Gup-ay, received phone text messages 
criticizing her alleged bias in presenting the facts behind the ambush of Dr. Constancio Claver 
through her local radio programme. The messages received were not really threats but only 
strongly worded criticism and a plea for Ms Gup-ay to be objective in her reporting. The 
Government reported that no complaint had been lodged. According to a report of the Philippine 
National Police-Provincial Regional Office (PNP-PRO) Ms Gup-ay reported the matter to the 
Tabuk Police Station for appropriate action. The police tried to locate the sender of the messages 
even though the messages were not really threats. The Government indicated that Ms Gup-ay no 
longer receives such messages, and the police assured her that appropriate assistance would be 
provided to her if the need arises. 
 
533.  By letter dated 6 November 2006, the Government of the Philippines replied to the 
communication of 25 August 2006 concerning <b>Angelo Gavarra</b>, <b>Manolito Gertes</b>, <b>Joseph 
Alicabo</b>, <b>Ricky Bindol</b>, <b>Rommel Mariano</b> and <b>June Torres</b> (all members of the Toyota Motors 
Corporation Philippines Workers Association, TMCPWA), stating that the individuals above 
were violently dispersed when they staged a protest at the Department of Labor and Employment 
(DOLE) office in Manila on 16 August 2006. The Government reported that more than 21 
members of TMCPWA forced their way to the DOLE building by overpowering the guards at 
the entrance gates of the building. Six persons went to the seventh floor where DOLE officials 
hold office, and inflicted injuries and threatened the lives of the security guards that were trying </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 193 
 
to stop them. They refused to leave the premises until their demands were met. According to the 
Government's  reply, some security guards were injured in their effort to keep the gates of the 
building closed and lives of DOLE officials and employees could have been jeopardized were 
not for the security guards&#8217; action. The police conducted an investigation but the 21 members of 
the TMCPMWA refused to give any statement and insisted on seeing a lawyer. The group was 
released the following day, after giving their statements. The Government informed that this 
incident was not the first where members of TMCPWA were involved in violent actions. No 
complaint had been lodged by the alleged victims or on their behalf. However, the Philippine 
authorities were at the time this reply was sent, in the process of determining the liabilities of 
those TMCPWA members under the penal statutes that they may have violated. The Government 
reported that no prosecutions had been undertaken against the alleged perpetrators. As far as the 
domestic legislation is concerned, the Philippine 1987 Constitution guarantees freedom of 
speech and of the press and the right of assembly and petition. Also the Public Assembly Act of 
1985 requires a mayor&#8217;s permit prior to the holding of a public assembly. The Government 
indicated that it has always been the rule that the applicant has the right to a permit subject only 
to reasonable regulation, and that the sole limitation of the rights of free speech and assembly is 
the danger, or a character both grave and imminent, of a serious evil to public safety, public 
morals, public health, or any legitimate public interest. 
 
534. By letter dated 21 July 2006, the Government of the Philippines replied to the 
communication of 12 July 2006 concerning the killing of <b>Mario Domingo</b>, Tito Marata, Eladio 
Dasi-An, Wifredo Cornea and Mr and Mrs George Vigo, asking the Special Rapporteur to 
provide more complete information on the places where the incidents occurred to ensure a proper 
coordination with the local government authorities of the Philippines.  
 
535. By letters dated on 8 September 2006 and 20 October 2006, the Government of the 
Philippines replied to the communication of 5 September 2006 concerning <b>Raffy Tulfo</b>. The 
Government informed that the Court of Appeals affirmed the 28 February 2005 decision of the 
Regional Trial Court of Pasay City convicting the accused Raffy Tulfo, together with two more 
people. The court sentenced him to imprisonment for six months to two years and to indemnify 
private complainant, Mr Carlos Ding So, for moral damages in the amount of PhP 500,000.00 
(US$10,000). Mr Tulfo appealed the CA&#8217;s decision affirming his conviction for 14 counts of 
libel before the Supreme Court, where it is pending to date. As for the background of the case, 
the Government indicated that Mr Tulfo has a regular column in a daily tabloid. From 3 March 
1999 to 12 May 1999, Mr Tulfo wrote 14 articles in his column about the supposedly shady 
dealings in the Bureau of Customs involving the complainant Carlos Ding So. According to Mr 
Tulfo, his sources in the Bureau of Customs reported about the alleged extortion activities of Mr 
So, as well as his supposed affair with a married woman. According to the Government&#8217;s reply, 
Mr Tulfo called Mr So an &#8220;extortionist&#8221;, a &#8220;corrupt public official&#8221;, a &#8220;smuggler&#8221;, an &#8220;adulterer&#8221; 
among other insults and asked Acting Customs Commissioner Nelson Tan to dismiss Mr So 
from the service. This prompted Mr So to institute complaints for libel against the three accused. 
It is also reported by the Government that Mr Tulfo, while not denying authorship and 
publication of the defamatory articles, insists that his writings were not libellous for lack of 
malicious intent. In its decision, the Court of Appeals found the existence of actual malice and 
denied the defence of Mr Tulfo. According to the Court of Appeals, Mr Tulfo wrote the news 
articles &#8220;with reckless disregard of whether they were false or not&#8221;. The Government of 
Philippines informed that freedom of speech and expression includes freedom from prior </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 194 
 
restraint and subsequent punishment. The Supreme Court ruled that the freedom of expression 
ranks in the hierarchy of constitutional rights higher than freedom from poverty and, hence, the 
norms for the regulations of expression place more stringent limits on State action. Philippine 
laws, however, do not protect libellous, slanderous and obscene speech. The Government 
informed that every libel prosecution is tested by the courts on the rigorous and exacting 
standard of whether it could violate such fundamental guarantee. Articles 353 to 359, together 
with articles 200 and 201 of the Revised Penal Code are mentioned.  
 
<b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b> 
536. By letter dated 19 January 2006, the Government of the Philippines replied to the 
communication of 25 August 2005 regarding the alleged attempt on the life of <b>Attorney Romeo 
T. Capulong</b>. The Government, following information from the Philippine National Police 
(PNP), informed that the allegation that Atty. Capulong was a victim of an attempt on his life by 
15 unidentified gunmen on 7 March 2005 is unsubstantiated. An investigation conducted by PNP 
revealed that there was no such incident reported or recorded. The Government indicated that 
elicitation on the matter was conducted in the neighbourhood concerned in Hacienda Luisita but 
it yielded no information. Police authorities continue their monitoring and any developments will 
be duly relayed to the Special Rapporteur. The Government also informed that no complaint has 
been lodged and that no penal, disciplinary or administrative sanctions have been imposed.  
 
537. By letter dated 12 January 2006, the Government of the Philippines replied to the 
communication of 6 July 2005 concerning Mr <b>Rolando Morales</b>. It was reported that the 
Department of Justice informed that State Prosecutor Juan Navera issued charges against the 
accused, Mr Federico Sarifa, Sonny Dimol a.k.a &#8220;Onyot&#8221; and a number of still unidentified 
&#8220;John Does&#8221; for the murder of Mr Morales and frustrated homicide as regards Ms Leticia 
Antigwa, Mr Morales&#8217; companion. The Government indicated that two criminal cases for murder 
and frustrated murder were filed with the General Santos City Regional Trial Court against 
Sarifa, Dimol and the John Does. The Court issued warrants of arrest against Sarifa and Dimol 
on 4 November 2005, and would later schedule arraignment and pre-trial proceedings. . 
Furthermore, the Government explained that the widow and family of Mr Morales were granted 
monetary compensation. It was further reported that there was no clear evidence yet regarding 
the motive for the murder and whether it was a consequence of the victim&#8217;s occupation as radio 
commentator.  
 
538. By letter dated 19 January 2006, the Government of the Philippines replied to the 
communication of 23 November 2005 concerning the killing of Mr <b>Roberto Ramos</b> and Mr 
<b>Ricardo &#8220;Ding&#8221; Uy</b>. The Government indicated that an initial police investigation revealed that 
on 20 November 2005, Mr Ramos was shot death and immediately after the shooting his 
assailants fled on a motorcycle. A &#8220;Task Group Ramos&#8221; was formed by the Police to investigate 
this killing. At the moment this reply was sent, a criminal complaint was yet to be instituted 
pending police investigations into the circumstances surrounding this death as well as the 
identification of the assailants. The Government explained what the procedure to follow in such 
cases was under the Philippine criminal justice system. As far as Mr Ricardo Uy is concerned, it 
was reported that initial police investigation revealed that on 18 November 
2005, Mr Uy was shot to death inside his store and that police attempted to pursue the gunman 
but the responding police officers failed to catch the suspect. &#8220;Task Force Uy&#8221; was formed to </p>

investigate his killing. The Government also stated that at the time this reply was sent, criminal 
complaint was yet to be instituted pending police investigation of the circumstances surrounding 
the death of Mr Uy as well as the identification of his assailants.  
 
539. By letter dated 19 January 2006, the Philippine Government responded to the urgent 
appeal sent on 25 August 2005 concerning Mr <b>Castor Gamalo, </b>Rev<b>. Edison Lapuz, </b>Mr 
<b>Alfredo Malinao, </b>Mr <b>Fedilito Dacut, Mr Romeo T. Capulong, </b>Fr.<b> Allen Caparro </b>and<b> </b>Ms<b> 
Aileen Caparro</b>. The Government stated that the Philippine National Police found that the the 
alleged attempt on the life of Mr Capulong by 15 unidentified gunmen, on 7 March 2005, was 
unsubstantiated. It was noted that an investigation conducted by  PNP concluded that no such 
report was filed regarding the aforementioned incident and that an inquiry launched in the 
concerned neighbourhood of Hacienda Luisita, yielded no results. The Government indicated 
that  PNP continues to monitor the situation and will provide information on any further 
developments regarding the case as appropriate.

Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding two human rights 
activists: Park Lae-goon of Sarangbang Group for Human Rights, an organization which works 
on human rights monitoring and advocacy, publication, providing resources and human rights 
education; and Cho Baek-ki of the Catholic Human Rights Committee, an organization which 
works on human rights advocacy. According to the information received, on 15 March 2006, a 
peaceful demonstration was held in Daechu-ri, Pyungtaek village, in Kyungki-do, against the 
forced eviction of villagers by riot police. The eviction followed the agreement by the United 
States and Korean Governments to expand the United States military base in Pyungtaek. The 
protesters were met by the riot police, who arrested a number of protesters and brought them to 
the police station, including Park Lae-goon and Cho Baek-ki. Reports indicate that Park Lae-
goon was arrested while sitting in front of the village school, while Cho Baek-ki was arrested 
while he was trying to stop the forklift truck that was used for evicting villagers from their 
homes. Some of the villagers were injured after being pushed to the ground by the riot police. 
Most of the arrested protesters were released on 17 March, but Park Lae-goon and Cho Baek-ki 
were held in Pyungtaek Prison at the time this communication was sent. There has been a 
national campaign since February 2006 against the forced eviction in Pyungtaek. 
 
542. On 13 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning 
<b>Mr Jang Do-jeong</b>, <b>Mr Shin Yong-gwan</b>,<b> and 28 other protestors</b>, who according to the 
information received, were arrested on 7 April 2006 while peacefully protesting against the 
cutting off of waterways leading to rice fields in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi province. It is further </p>

reported that the 28 protestors were released but that Jang Do-jeong and Shin Yong-gwan, 
remain in detention and had been charged with interference with government operations and 
illegal protest. It is alleged that during the arrests, police officers used excessive force and that 
10 protestors were injured as a result. It was reported that daily candlelight vigils had been held 
for over 500 days in in Pyeongtaek, in opposition to the forced eviction of farmers from their 
land for the expansion of a United States military forces base in Pyeongtaek. The protestors 
included people from Pyeongtaek and hundreds of local farmers who claimed that the expansion 
of the United States military base will affect the livelihoods of hundreds of local farmers and 
their families; and members of the South<b> </b>Korea Committee Against the United States Base 
Extension in Pyeontaek (KCPT<b>),</b> and peace activists who claim the expansion of the United 
States military base may have a negative impact on peace in the Korean Peninsula. It was 
reported that the Defence Ministry had blocked two out of three canals leading to the rice fields 
and one pump pipe in order to prevent farmers from planting rice. Furthermore allegedly, the 
Ministry of Defence had destroyed some rice fields and some bridges to prevent farmers from 
accessing the rice fields. Concern was expressed that the charges against Jang Do-jeong and Shin 
Yong-gwan may have represented an attempt to prevent them from legitimately peaceful 
protesting in defence of human rights, in particular the rights of the rice farmers whose 
livelihoods will be adversely affected by the closing of waterways in Pyeongtaek and who await 
their appeal to be heard at the Central Land Tribunal.  
 
543. On 27 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning <b>more than 100 
participants of a demonstration</b> against the restructuring of the Rural Development 
Administration (RDA). According to the information received, on 25 May 2006, about 200 
members of the Korean Government Employees Union (KGEU) participated in a peaceful 
demonstration in front of RDA, protesting against restructuring plans and the alleged repression 
against KGEU. The demonstration had been legally notified to the authority in advance. It was 
reported that the riot police had violently raided the demonstration and blocked people from 
participating in in it. Several people were severely beaten by the riot police and plain clothes 
police officers, including <b>Mr</b> <b>Kim Jeong Soo</b>, KGEU, Secretary-General; and <b>Mr</b> <b>Choi Nak 
Sam</b>, Secretary of Public Relations. They were taken to the hospital. Eight KGEU members were 
arrested, against whom warrants of detention were issued. They were brought before the Suwon 
Joongbu police station. The court subsequently approved four of those warrants, which resulted 
in the detention of <b>Mr</b> <b>Park Woon Yong</b>, Secretary of Organizing and Dispute; <b>Mr</b> <b>Lee Jeong 
Soo</b>, Director of Organizing and Dispute; and two KGEU vice-presidents, <b>Mr</b> <b>Park Kee Han</b> 
and <b>Mr</b> <b>Han Seok Woo</b>. The other four were released. On 9 June 2006, <b>Mr</b> Park Woon Yong, 
<b>Mr</b> Lee Jeong Soo, <b>Mr</b> Park Kee Han and <b>Mr</b> Han Seok Woo were prosecuted by the Suwon 
Regional Prosecutor's Office. They were charged for all or several of the following: bodily injury 
by special obstruction of public duty, special obstruction of public duty, general obstruction of 
traffic, violation of Assembly and Demonstrations Act and violation of Local Public Officials 
Act. The first hearing of their trial should have been held on 28 June 2006.  
 
544. On 19 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegation 
concerning <b><i>Korean Government Employees Union (KGEU)</i></b>  Chapter Offices as part of the 
implementation of the &#8220;Directive to promote the transformation of illegal organisations into legal 
trade unions (voluntary withdrawal of membership)&#8221; issued on 22 March 2006 by the Ministry 
of Government Administration and Home Affairs. According to the information received, on 22 </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 197 
 
and 25 September 2006, thousands of riot policemen were reportedly deployed around more than 
100 municipalities to implement the Directive which qualified KGEU as an &#8220;illegal 
organisation&#8221; for failing to submit notice of establishment pursuant to this law. These policemen 
allegedly allowed groups of men hired by municipalities to storm various KGEU local offices 
and forcefully remove its members. In some cases, riot policemen allegedly cut off electricity, 
Internet access and phone lines. In a number of incidents, members of KGEU and members of 
solidarity organisations, such as the Korean Public Service Union (KPSU) and the Democratic 
Labour Party, were arrested. Reports indicated that, so far, more than 81 KGEU chapter offices 
were closed down across the country. An urgent appeal concerning this organization was sent on 
27 June 2006. Concerns were expressed that these acts of repression against KGEU members 
and offices may have been in retaliation of their legitimate activities in defence of labour rights 
in South Korea. 
 
<b>Replies from the Government 
</b> 
545. By letter dated 19 April 2006, the Government of the Republic of Korea replied to the 
communication of 22 March 2006 concerning the arrest of protesters against expanding the 
United States base in Pyongtaek. The Government informed that on 15 March 2006, the police 
arrested illegal and violent protesters, among whom Mr <b>Park Rae-Goon </b>and Mr <b>Joh Baek-Gi</b>; 
they were sent to the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office on 24 March 2006 and 5 days after that they were 
released on bail. The Government indicated that the suspects were leaders of illegal and violent 
riots, interfering in the execution of provisional disposition of lands and buildings around 
Daechu branch school in line with the court&#8217;s decision. Additionally, the Government explained 
that suspects had interfered in police arrests of criminals and in the banning of agricultural 
activities by the Ministry of National Defence, and attacked the police officers with fists. The 
Korean Government stated that it was not a peaceful protest and that &#8220;Urgent Action&#8221;, a group 
demanding a release of Park Rae Goon and Joh Baek Gi, submitted a petition to the National 
Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on 24 March 2006 claiming that the police used force 
against protesters. In response, NHRC expressed its willingness to pay special attention to 
matters relating to the arrest of two human rights activist Park and Joh. The Government reported 
that peaceful rallies and demonstrations are guaranteed in accordance with relevant laws. 
Nonetheless, with a view to maintaining the rule of law principle, the Korean Government 
informed that they impose stringent measures against illegal or violent demonstrations involving 
an act of challenging public authority or occupying public facilities. The Government stated that 
the arrest of Park Rae-Goon and Joh Baek-Gi is legal given that obstructing the performance of 
official duties and leading an illegal and violent riot constitute a crime under article 70 of the 
Criminal Procedure Code. Hence, the Government indicated that the international regulations on 
freedom of opinion and expression are not applicable to this case.  
 
546. By letter dated 6 September 2006, the Government of the Republic of Korea replied to the 
communication of 13 April 2006, indicating that on 7 April 2006, the police arrested illegal and 
violent protesters, among whom  <b>Shin Yong-Gwan</b> and <b>Jang Do-Jeong</b>. On 14 April 2006, three 
days after both individuals were issued detention warrants, they were sent to prosecution and on 
trial. The Government informed that suspects Shin Yong-Gwan and Jang Do-Jeong, against the 
relocation of the Unitd States basis, interrupted the Ministry of National Defence (MND) 
presentation for residents on the construction of United States bases in Pyeongtaek and attacked 
police by throwing burning rice straws. According to the Government, this was done in an </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 198 
 
attempt to hamper the duty of MND to block farm roads and waterways of the lands planned for 
the said United States bases. The Government indicated that this was not a peaceful protest, and 
that the suspects themselves used illegal violence. It was reported that there had been no appeal 
until now from either of the suspects. The Korean Government informed that they respect 
peaceful demonstrations. The two suspects were detained in accordance with article 70 on the 
Code of Criminal Procedure.

548. On 1 September 2006, <b>Slavko Savic</b>, senior editor of <i>RTV Kursumlija</i>, was allegedly 
sentenced by the Municipal Court in Prokuplje to four months' imprisonment without parole for 
libel. This judgment confirmed the first degree sentence. From 11 March through 1 April 2005, 
<i>RTV Kursumlija</i> was broadcasting text messages (SMS) sent by viewers, among which there 
were some, in an anonymous form, assuming that a member of the Municipal Assembly of 
Kursumlija had allegedly committed a petty crime in a town store. <i>RTV Kursumlija</i> is a member 
of the <i>Association of Independent Electronic Media (ANEM)</i>. 
 
549. On 4 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning <b>Snezana 
Nikolic</b>, a journalist of the daily <i>Dnevnik</i>, who on 21 September 2006, was given a six-month 
prison sentence, suspended for two years, by the Novi Sad District Court for an article she had 
published on Dnevnik four years ago. In the said article, Ms Nikkolic reported about the 
involvement of a lawyer in a conflict surrounding some construction sites in Vojvodina. 
Reportedly, the District Court's sentence stated that, in Nikolic's case, a suspension in the 
execution of the sentence was less harsh than a fine. 
 
<b>Observations

<b>R&#233;ponses du Gouvernement</b> 
 
552. On 23 May 2006, the Government replied to an allegation letter send by the Special 
Rapporteur on 27 February 2006, on the cases of the two Romanian journalists, Mr <b>Garteanu</b> 
and Mr <b>Oancea</b>, investigated for the possession of classified documents. These two cases are 
investigated under the file no. 51/D/P/2006, instrumented by the Department for Investigating 
Organized Crime and Terrorism Offenses, within the General Prosecutors' office of the High 
Court of Cassation and Justice. According to the information provided by the Romanian 
competent institutions, in both cases, the investigations concerns offenses stipulated by the Law 
no. 51/1991 on the national security of Romania. Article 19, paragraph 1 forbids the collection 
and transmission of information of a secret or confidential nature, by any means, without 
respecting the legal framework.  Law No. 182/2002 regarding classified information, referred to 
in your letter, does not include criminal law provisions. Consequently, in establishing the 
criminal responsibility on cases of illegal transmission of classified information, the Romanian 
law does not distinguish between persons that are compelled to keep confidential information 
and the other citizens. Nevertheless, a broad revision of the entire legal framework concerning 
national security and intelligence activity in Romania is under way. The new laws will meet the 
latest developments, as well as  European and international requirements in these areas, and 
appropriate attention will be paid to increasing the guarantees afforded for the full respect of the 
freedom of expression. The case of the two journalists is investigated within the criminal file no. 
51/D/P/2006, instrumented by the Department for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism 
Offenses (DIOCTO) within the General Prosecutors' office of the High Court of Cassation and 
Justice. DIOCTO is checking the circumstances under which the leak of classified military 
information took place at some units of the Ministry of Defence and is identifying those 
responsible.  The criminal investigation initiated against Mr Marion Garleanu and Mr Sorin 
Oancea (the journalist who possessed CDs with classified information) aims to collect the 
evidence regarding the crimes of unlawful possession and transmission of secret documents, to 
identify the perpetrators and establish their responsibility, in order to decide whether to start the 
legal action. Up till now, the investigation had shown that the two journalists held the CDs with 
classified military information for five months. They did not use the information for journalistic 
purposes, nor did they give the CDs over to the authorities, although they mentioned their 
existence during private and official<b> </b>conversations. Moreover, in December 2005 and January 
2006, respectively, the two journalists independently sent the CDs to other people. DIOCTO 
states that other journalists revealed publicly the leaks of classified information from the 
Ministry of Defence and, at the same time, gave the CDs over to the competent authorities. 
DIOCTO mentions that none of the investigations made in this case was aimed to identify any 
journalistic source or to restrain the freedom of expression or information of the two journalists. 
The deeds of the two journalists, namely possessing classified military information and 
transmitting such information under other circumstances than those stipulated by the law, qualify 
as offences under the Criminal code and the Law on the National Security of Romania. The two 
laws do not exonerate journalists that commit such deeds from criminal responsibilities.

554. On 22 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegation 
concerning Ms <b>Elina Ersenoyeva</b>, an employee of the non-governmental organisation INFO-
MOST, a journalist with the &#8220;Chechen Society&#8221; newspaper and her aunt Ms Rovzan Ersenoyeva. 
INFO-MOST provides information for young HIV/AIDS sufferers in Chechnya and is funded by 
UNICEF. As a journalist, Ms Elina Ersenoyeva has written a number of articles which have 
reported on human rights violations allegedly committed by the authorities in Chechnya. 
According to the information received, on 17 August 2006, Ms Elina Ersenoyeva and Ms 
Rovzan Ersenoyeva were abducted by a group of armed, masked men in Proskept Pobedy, 
Grozny, Chechnya. Elina Ersenoyeva and Rovzan Ersenoyeva were reportedly forced into a car 
and had their heads covered. It was reported that they were taken to an unknown location and 
forced into basement. Approximately two hours later, Rovzan Ersenoyeva was taken from the 
basement and to a street in Grozny, where she was released. Allegedly, Elina Ersenoyeva 
contacted her mother on the evening of 17 August 2006 by mobile telephone and stated that she 
would be released that same evening. Reportedly, Elina Ersenoyeva has not been seen since 17 
August 2006 and her whereabouts remain unknown. On 15 August 2006, by letter to a number of 
international human rights organizations, Elina Ersenoyeva had reportedly stated that she and her 
family had been threatened and harassed by Russian security forces. Allegedly, the security 
forces had arrested and beaten Elina Ersenoyeva&#8217;s mother and had confiscated her personal 
possessions. Grave concerns were expressed regarding the physical and psychological integrity 
of Ms Elina Ersenoyeva and the fact that her alleged abduction may have been connected with 
her activities in defence of human rights, in particular her reporting of human rights violations in 
Chechnya. 
 
555. On 8 September 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning the 
situation of the independent newspaper <b><i>Permsky Obozrevatel's</i></b> . According to information 
received, on 22 August 2006, the home of <b>Vladimir Korolyov</b>, a <i>Permsky Obozrevate</i>l's 
photojournalist, was searched in his absence. Allegedly, investigators took personal items from 
his home and told Korolyov's wife that a federal warrant had been issued for Mr Korolyov. On 
10 August 2006, <b>Evgeniya Silivanova</b>, a <i>Permsky Obozrevatel</i> journalist, was followed by an 
unknown man as she was returning home from work. The man, who later on introduced himself 
as an investigator from the Perm Prosecutor's Office, accused Ms Silivanova of lack of 
cooperation with an investigation, warning her of being under investigation for her involvement 
in illegal activities. Ms Silivanova reportedly filed a complaint with the Perm&#8217;s Prosecutor 
Office. On 2 August 2006, <i>the offices of Permsky Obozrevatel</i> and its partner company, <b><i>Alfa</i></b> , 
were raided by a group of law enforcement officers, including armed Federal Security Service 
(FSB) agents, investigators from Perm's Prosecutor's Office, and local police officers. It has been 
reported that they took computers, floppy disks, flash cards, as well as personal iteMs The 
authorities argued the newspaper had been accused of disclosing state secrets. Reportedly the 
seized equipment has not been returned. On 25 May 2006, <i>Permsky Obozrevatel's</i> and <i>Alfa's</i> 
offices were searched by OMON team masked members. Newspaper material and equipment 
were confiscated. Although the Perm Regional Court ruled in favor of the newspaper, ordering 
the authorities to return the confiscated computers, on 13 June 2006 the computers were 
allegedly still in their possession. On 17 March 2006, the special edition on the elections issued 
by <i>Permsky Obozrevatel</i> was confiscated following an order issued by the Mayor candidate, Igor </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1

Shubin. The confiscated edition allegedly contained negative information about Shubin's election 
campaign. At the moment when this communication was sent, <i>Permsky Obozrevatel</i> was under 
investigation for allegedly having committed the crimes of &quot;insult,&quot; &quot;violating the right to private 
life,&quot; and &quot;disclosing state secrets.&quot;  
 
556. On 6 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegation 
concerning Mr <b>Lev Ponomarev</b>, Executive Director of the Russian movement &#8220;For Human 
Rights&#8221;, a coalition of non-governmental organisations and civil society groups involved in the 
promotion and protection of human rights in Russia. Mr Ponomarev was subject of an urgent 
appeal sent on 24 February 2004. According to the information received, on 26 September 2006, 
Mr Ponomarev was arrested and sentenced to three days' detention for organising a peaceful 
demonstration in honour of the victims of the Beslan tragedy. Reportedly, the organizers of the 
event had complied with the Federal Law of the Russian Federation on assemblies, meetings, 
demonstrations, processions and pickets by informing the relevant authorities of their intention to 
hold a commemorative event in Lubianka square in Moscow on 3 September 2006. According to 
sources the authorities suggested that the demonstration be held on a different day in order to 
guarantee &#8220;maximum security for the participants&#8221; involved. However, a crowd of approximately 
50 demonstrators gathered at Lubianka Square on 3 September, where they encountered 
members of the police force, and subsequently a number of individuals were allegedly detained 
for a brief period. It is reported that 13 individuals were charged with offences pertaining to the 
administrative code of the Russian Federation. It is further reported that Mr Ponomarev was the 
first of those charged to appear before a court where he was sentenced to three days' detention 
and, according to sources, he was released on 29 September 2006. Concerns were expressed that 
the arrest and subsequent detention of Mr Ponomarev was an attempt to prevent him from 
carrying out his activities in defence of human rights. 
 
557. On 12 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture, sent an allegation letter concerning, journalist and author <b>Anna 
Politkovskaya</b>, who was killed on 7 October 2006, in her apartment building in Moscow. She 
was one of the leading journalists on Chechnya, known for her independent reporting on human 
rights violations against civilians in Chechnya. She also published several books about Chechnya 
and on the political situation in the country. Well known and appreciated in Russia and abroad, 
she won several international awards for her commitment to human rights and her professional 
activity.  Ms Politkovskaya repeatedly faced intimidation and harassment, and was detained and 
threatened on several occasions, including in Chechnya.  She often received death threats. Grave 
concerns were expressed that Ms Politkovskaya was killed because of her legitimate activities in 
defence of human rights, i.e. her continuous denunciation of human rights abuses committed by 
Russian forces and their Chechen allies through two wars in Chechnya. In particular, the Special 
Rapporteur on torture, in view of his at that time planned mission to the Russian Federation with 
one of its focuses being on the Republic of Chechnya, expressed his concern that she may have 
been killed in connection with a report she was to have filed in relation to torture and 
disappearances in Chechnya.

<b>Replies from the Governmnent 
 
</b>558. By letter dated 4 October 2006, the Government of the Russian Federation replied to the 
communication of 22 August 2006 concerning the abduction of Ms <b>E.A. Ersenoeva</b>. The 
Government noted that criminal proceedings were instituted by the procurator&#8217;s office of the 
Zavod district in Grozny on the basis of evidence of an offence contrary to article 126, paragraph 
2 (a), of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (abduction by a group of persons by prior 
conspiracy). In accordance with the results of the investigation no information indicated that 
Russian law enforcement agencies were threatening Ms Ersenoeva and her family, or that her 
disappearance was linked to her work as a human rights defender, in particular her reports of 
human rights violations in the Chechen Republic. According to the Government of the Russian 
Federation, Ms Ersenoeva wrote about 12 articles about social issues such as the disabled and 
refugees while working for the newspaper &#8220;Chechen Society&#8221; and her published work contained 
nothing controversial or critical. The Government indicated that the investigation of this criminal 
case had not yet been completed.  
 
559. By letter dated 24 November 2006, the Government of the Russian Federation replied to 
the communication of 22 August 2006 providing supplementary information to the case of Ms 
<b>E.A. Ersenoeva</b>. The Government noted that on 17 August 2006, Elina Alaudinovna Ersenoeva, 
a freelance reporter with the newspaper Chechenskoe Obshchestvo (&#8220;Chechen Society&#8221;), was 
abducted by a group of eight unidentified men armed with automatic weapons. On 29 August 
2006, criminal proceedings were initiated on this matter by the Zavodskoy district procurator&#8217;s 
office in Grozny. In the course of the criminal investigation, the authorities of the Procurator of 
the Chechen Republic took steps to verify statements in an open letter addressed by a number of 
non- governmental organizations (International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights, 
International Federation of Human Rights and the Demos Centre) to the effect that, several days 
before her abduction, Elina Ersenoeva had appealed to them for protection from harassment by 
the security forces to which she was being subjected because she was the wife of Shamil Basaev. 
The Government indicated that Elina Ersenoeva&#8217;s mother, M.I. Ersenoeva, who was also 
questioned in the case as a victim, stated that, after her daughter had married Basaev, she had not 
been harassed by anyone. After Shamil Basaev&#8217;s death, in the summer of 2006, they were visited 
at her house by employees of the Federal Security Service from the town of Nazran, who voiced 
no complaints to her daughter during their discussions with her. The Government informed that 
E.K. Astamirova, also questioned in this matter as a witness, affirmed that she was the aunt of 
Elina Ersenoeva. According to E.K. Astamirova, she was someone in whom Elina Ersenoeva 
confided, yet the latter never mentioned to her that she was being subject to harassment. It was 
reported by the Government that before her niece was abducted, she was not aware that she had 
ever approached any human rights organizations. The Government concluded that there was no 
evidence from the records of the questioning of T.M. Aliev, editor- in-chief of the newspaper 
Chechenskoe Obshchestvo, who was brought in as a witness, indicating that Elina Ersenoeva had 
appealed to him for help in connection with any harassment. The investigations into this matter 
were continuing under the supervision of the authorities of the procurator of the Chechen 
Republic at the time this letter was received.

urgent appeal sent on 9 June 2005 concerning <b>Mr Stanislav Dmitrievsky</b>, Director of the 
Nizhny Novgorod-based Russian human rights NGO Russian Chechen Friendship Society 
(RCFS), and its Deputy Director, <b>Ms Oksana Chelysheva. </b>The Government stated that in 
January 2005, following the publication of two articles, &#8220;An appeal to the Russian people by 
Ahmed Zakaev, Deputy Prime Minister of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria&#8221; and &#8220;An appeal by 
President Aslan Maskhadov of the Chechen Republic to the European Parliament&#8221; 
Pravozashchita newspaper, which is published by the Nizhny Novgorod Human Rights 
Association and the interregional voluntary organization Russian-Chechen Friendship Society, 
the Nizhny Novgorod regional procurator&#8217;s office opened criminal proceedings under article 
282, paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (Incitement to national, racial 
or religious hatred). The Government indicated that in the course of the criminal investigation, 
the executive director of the Nizhny Novgorod Human Rights Association, S.M. Dmitrievsky, 
was charged. On 3 February 2006, the Sovetsky district court in Nizhny Novgorod found him 
guilty as charged and he was sentenced to two years&#8217; in prison, suspended, with a four-year 
probation order. It was also noted that Criminal proceedings were also initiated against the 
Russian-Chechen Friendship Society on 2 September 2005, under article 199, paragraph 2, of the 
Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (Non-payment by an organization of tax and/or duty).   
 
<b>Observations 
 
</b>561. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its replies, and notes that the 
communication dated<b> </b>6 October 2006 was still in the process of being translated, at the time this 
report was finalised.<b>

<p>562. On 11 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal concerning 
the journalist and writer <b>Wajeha Al-Houwaider</b>. According to the information received, on 4 
August 2006, Ms Al-Howaider was arrested, while walking on the bridge connecting Saudi 
Arabia with Bahrain holding a banner that stated &#8220;Give women their rights&#8221;. According to the 
information received, Ms Al-Howaider had been banned from writing in the Saudi press in 2003, 
in accordance with the decree passed by the Ministry of Information in that same year. Concern 
was expressed that her arrest may have represented an attempt by the authorities to prevent her 
from carrying out legitimate activities to raise awareness of women&#8217;s human rights and her 
exercise of freedom of expression. 
 
563. On 10 November 2006, the Special Rapporteur, the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences and Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal concerning Ms <b>Wajeha Al-
Huwaider</b>, a member of the group Human Rights First in Saudi Arabia. According to 
information received, officers of the Mabahith security force detained Ms Wajeha Al-Huwaider 
in Khobar on 20 September 2006. They interrogated her for six hours about a women's rights 
protest she was organizing. During the interrogation, the Mabahith officers demanded Ms Al-</p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 204 
 
Huwaider to provide written answers to prepared questions concerning her internet writings and 
human rights activities. They then demanded that she signed a pledge not to engage in any future 
human rights activities, including writing articles, organizing protests and speaking to journalists 
or foreign organizations. They did not provide her with a copy of the signed pledge. Officers had 
also threatened her with losing her job with Saudi Aramco, the national oil company, if she were 
to break the pledge made. Following her release, she tried to return to Bahrain where she resides. 
Reportedly, border officials told her that her name appeared on a list of persons banned from 
travel, and that she was not allowed to leave Saudi Arabia. Only on 28 September 2006, officials 
lifted the ban and allowed her to return to Bahrain. Reportedly, Ms Al-Huwaider had been 
arrested before due to her advocacy for women&#8217;s rights. She was the subject of a previous urgent 
appeal dated 11 August 2006. Concern was expressed that the arrest and interrogation of Ms Al-
Huwaider and the signed pledge extracted from her may have represented a new attempt by the 
authorities to prevent her from carrying out her legitimate activities to raise awareness of 
women's human rights and her exercise of freedom of expression. 
 
<b>Observations 
</b> 
564. At the time this report was finalized, the Special Rapporteur had not received any replies 
to the communications sent. The Special Rapporteur therefore invites the Government to respond 
to these allegations.

Follow-up to previously transmitted communications</b>**<b> 
</b> 
565. By letter dated 26 January 2006, the Government of Serbia and Montenegro replied to the 
communication of 14 September 2005 concerning threats to <b>MrMatic, Mr Momcilo Veljkovic 
</b>and<b> Mr Sasa Stojkovic</b>. In relation to Mr Matic, police found out that its Belgrade Secretariat 
had not reported any hate mail addressed to Mr Matic. However it was discovered that the 
letterbox of the B92 Broadcasting Agency, contained on 5 September 2005 a letter that the 
organization calling itself the &#8220;Serbian Volunteer Regiment&#8221; wrote to Mr Matic. A criminal 
complaint was lodged with the First Belgrade District Prosecrutor&#8217;s Office against unknown 
persons for violating safety and security, an offence under Article 67 of the Criminal Code of the 
Republic of Serbia. Officers of the Public Law and Order Department of the Belgrade Secretariat 
found out that the B92 broadcaster was e-mailed twice on 6 June 2005 by unknown individuals 
belonging to an organization called &#8220;Brotherhood of Serbs Knights&#8221;, issuing death threats 
against B92 director, Mr Matic. Investigations have found out that the e-mails were coming from 
various sites, one of them from the Netherlands. Interpol has been asked to locate the PC used to 
send the messages concerned out of the Netherlands but failed to respond to this request. The 
Government indicated that the police was not able to gather evidence on the so-called Serbian 
Volunteer Regiment organization, but if messages were sent again forensic experts would 
                                                 
**<b> </b>The reply from the Government was sent before 3 June 2006, when the Secretary-General received a letter from 
the President of the Republic of Serbia informing him that the membership of Serbia and Montenegro in the United 
Nations was to be continued by the Republic of Serbia and that the name &#8220;Republic of Serbia&#8221; was henceforth to be 
used instead of the name &#8220;Serbia and Montenegro&#8221;. </p>

threats, he was interviewed by the Police and a report was made thereon. Other journalist of the 
newspaper, together with a judge and a public prosecutor were also sent this messages, which 
were signed on behalf of the &#8220;Serbian Liberation Front&#8221;, &#8220;Serbian Liberation Resistance&#8221;,  
&#8220;Serbian Liberation Army&#8221;, &#8220;Serbian Death Squad&#8221; and &#8220;Serbian Volunteer Regiment&#8221;. The real 
identity of the authors is still unknown. Finally, the Government reported on the situation of Mr 
Sasa Stojkovic, who received also a verbal threat by the local secretary of the Serbian Radical 
Party on 2 September 2005. This incident was not reported to the police. The Government 
indicated that the Municipal Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office in Vranje will decide on the described 
incidents.

566. Le 11 mai 2006, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a envoy&#233; une lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation concernant <b>Pape 
Cheikh Fall</b>, journaliste de la station s&#233;n&#233;galaise <i>Radio Futurs M&#233;dias</i> &#224; Mback&#233;, qui aurait &#233;t&#233;

cr&#226;ne, &#224; la nuque et &#224; la tempe, le journaliste s'est vu signifier une incapacit&#233; de travail de 15 
jours.  Selon les informations re&#231;ues, l'un de ses agresseurs ferait partie des disciples d&#8217;un 
marabout, dont le nom est connu du Rapporteur, qui aurait annonc&#233; &#224; la presse son intention de 
soutenir la r&#233;&#233;lection du pr&#233;sident actuel lors du scrutin pr&#233;sidentiel pr&#233;vu en f&#233;vrier 2007.  Le 
marabout aurait assur&#233; d&#8217;&#234;tre en mesure de mobiliser quatre millions de disciples.  Quelques 
jours avant, Pape Cheikh Fall avait r&#233;alis&#233; et diffus&#233; une interview avec un disciple du marabout 
qui avait exprim&#233; des opinions divergentes quant au soutien populaire de son ma&#238;tre, qui, &#224; son

567. Le 7 juillet 2006, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial et la Pr&#233;sidente-Rapporteuse du Groupe de travail 
sur les d&#233;tentions arbitraires, ont envoy&#233; un appel urgent au sujet de <b>Moustapha Sow</b>, directeur 
de publication du quotidien <i>L'Office</i>, qui aurait &#233;t&#233; incarc&#233;r&#233;, le 29 juin 2006, pour purger une 
peine &#224; six mois de prison ferme, pour diffamation &#224; l'encontre d'un homme d'affaires, prononc&#233;e 
par un tribunal de Dakar en f&#233;vrier 2006.  Un mandat d'arr&#234;t aurait &#233;t&#233; lanc&#233; en f&#233;vrier, mais 
n'avait &#233;t&#233; suivi d'aucun effet jusqu'&#224; la convocation du journaliste &#224; la Brigade de Recherche.  
Moustapha Sow serait actuellement d&#233;tenu &#224; la maison d'arr&#234;t de Reubeuss. Ses avocats auraient 
d&#233;pos&#233; une demande de mainlev&#233;e devant la cour d'appel de Dakar. Le directeur de publication 
de <i>L'Office</i> &#233;tait poursuivi pour diffamation &#224; l'encontre d'un homme d'affaires &#8211; dont le nom est 
connu du Rapporteur &#8211; parce que <i>L&#8217;Office</i> aurait publi&#233; de nombreux articles sur le r&#244;le pr&#233;sum&#233;

donc un tiers absolu dans cette affaire. Il s'agit d'un dossier strictement priv&#233; opposant deux 
citoyens dont l'un a choisi de s'adresser &#224; la justice.  D&#232;s lors, les faits invoqu&#233;s ne sauraient 
appeler aucun commentaire particulier, dans la mesure o&#249; les proc&#232;s en diffamation sont 
courants dans la justice et ancr&#233;s dans l'opinion. Ces proc&#232;s opposent en g&#233;n&#233;ral, deux 
particuliers, comme c'est d'ailleurs le cas en l'esp&#232;ce.  Il n'y a eu ni enqu&#234;te, ni investigation 
judiciaire pour la simple raison que Bara Tall, qui s&#8217;est port&#233; partie civile, a directement saisi 
la juridiction comp&#233;tente. Une telle proc&#233;dure est parfaitement l&#233;gale. Elle est obtenue gr&#226;ce 
au m&#233;canisme de la citation directe, laiss&#233; &#224; l'appr&#233;ciation de la partie demanderesse, &#224; ses 
risques et p&#233;rils, en vue du succ&#232;s ou de la succombance pouvant &#233;ventuellement d&#233;couler de 
cette action. Cette proc&#233;dure est pr&#233;vue par les articles 376, 380 et 396 du Code de proc&#233;dure 
p&#233;nale du S&#233;n&#233;gal.  Au S&#233;n&#233;gal, la libert&#233; d'opinion et d'expression est prot&#233;g&#233;e. Aucune 
formalit&#233; n'est, &#224; cet &#233;gard, n&#233;cessaire pour cr&#233;er un journal et aucune censure n'est 
impos&#233;e aux articles et aux propos des citoyens publi&#233;s dans les journaux. La 
Constitution s&#233;n&#233;galaise du 22 janvier 2001 dispose en son article 8 que : &#171; La 
R&#233;publique du S&#233;n&#233;gal garantit &#224; tous les citoyens les libert&#233;s individuelles 
fondamentales, les droits &#233;conomiques et sociaux, ainsi que les droits collectifs &#187;.  Parmi 
ces libert&#233;s figurent, en bonne place, la libert&#233; d'expression.  Par cons&#233;quent, au S&#233;n&#233;gal, 
la libert&#233; d'expression est inscrite dans le droit positif. La valeur constitutionnelle qui lui 
est attach&#233;e est gage de son respect. S'agissant de la libert&#233; de la presse, elle tire sa 
substance de la libert&#233; d'expression dont elle est une &#233;manation et une des manifestations. 
La libert&#233; de la presse, anciennement organis&#233;e par la loi n&#176; 79 - 44 du 11 avril 1979, 
modifi&#233;e par la loi n&#176; 86 - 22 du 16 juin 1986, est aujourd'hui r&#233;gie par la loi n&#176; 96 - 04 
du 22 f&#233;vrier 1996 portant Code de la presse.  Cette nouvelle l&#233;gislation qui part de la 
refonte de la loi n&#176; 79 - 44 modifi&#233;e, du 11 avril 1979, cons&#233;quence de 
l'approfondissement de la d&#233;mocratie au S&#233;n&#233;gal, &#233;tait devenue n&#233;cessaire &#171; pour mieux 
tenir compte des r&#233;alit&#233;s du nouveau paysage m&#233;diatique s&#233;n&#233;galais, caract&#233;ris&#233; par une 
diversit&#233; de journaux et de publications ainsi que par l'ouverture du secteur de 
l'audiovisuel. &#187;  Dans les principes g&#233;n&#233;raux qu'il vise, l'expos&#233; des motifs de la loi n&#176; 96 - 
04 du 22 f&#233;vrier 1996 portant Code de la presse, fait r&#233;f&#233;rence au respect de l'article 8 de la 
Constitution, notamment, en ce que ce Code reconna&#238;t &#224; tout citoyen, le droit d'exprimer et 
de diffuser librement ses opinions par la parole, la plume, l'image, dans les limites prescrites 
par les lois et r&#232;glements, et dans le respect de l'honneur d'autrui.  Ces limites prescrites sont 
prises en charge par le droit p&#233;nal s&#233;n&#233;galais.  Ainsi, le Code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale, dans ses 
articles 618 &#224; 632, pr&#233;voit une proc&#233;dure sp&#233;ciale en mati&#232;re de d&#233;lits de presse tandis que le 
Code p&#233;nal, avec les articles 248 &#224; 279, pr&#233;voit les infractions et les sanctions li&#233;es aux d&#233;lits 
de presse.  Par ailleurs, la diffamation est r&#233;gie par les articles 248, 268 alin&#233;a 1 et 261 alin&#233;a 
1 du Code p&#233;nal, comme dans les articles 618 &#224; 632 ci-dessus mentionn&#233;s, du Code de 
proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale.  La l&#233;gislation s&#233;n&#233;galaise qui r&#233;glemente la libert&#233; de la presse en tenant 
compte des limites prescrites, ci-dessus &#233;voqu&#233;es, est conforme &#224; l'article 19 du Pacte 
international relatif aux droits civils et politiques du 16 d&#233;cembre 1966 que le S&#233;n&#233;gal a 
ratifi&#233; le 13 f&#233;vrier 1978. Cette disposition prescrit la libert&#233; d'expression en ses alin&#233;as 1 et 
2, mais proscrit tout abus en envisageant &#171; certaines restrictions qui doivent, toutefois, &#234;tre 
express&#233;ment fix&#233;es par la loi et qui sont n&#233;cessaires <i>a</i>) au respect des droits ou de la 
r&#233;putation d'autrui, <i>b</i>) &#224; la sauvegarde de la s&#233;curit&#233; nationale, de l'ordre public, de la sant&#233; ou 
de la moralit&#233; publique &#187;.  Par cons&#233;quent, la libert&#233; de la presse est encadr&#233;e tant au plan 
national qu'au plan international.  Au surplus, dans le pr&#233;ambule de la Constitution, le 
constituant s&#233;n&#233;galais affirme l'adh&#233;sion du S&#233;n&#233;gal &#171; &#224; la D&#233;claration des Droits de </p>

l'Homme et du Citoyen de 1789 et aux instruments internationaux adopt&#233;s par l'Organisation 
des Nations Unies et l'Organisation de l Unit&#233; Africaine &#187;. Ce qui constitue une autre 
garantie consolid&#233;e, surtout avec l'&#233;largissement du bloc de la constitutionalit&#233; des lois au 
pr&#233;ambule de la Constitution, par le Juge constitutionnel s&#233;n&#233;galais, dans sa d&#233;cision du 16 
d&#233;cembre 1993 relative au Trait&#233; de Port-Louis cr&#233;ant l&#8217;Organisation pour l'Harmonisation 
du Droit des Affaires en Afrique (OHADA).  S'agissant de la proc&#233;dure suivie dans cette 
affaire, la proc&#233;dure initi&#233;e par Bara Tall, entrepreneur, a commenc&#233; par la remise de la 
citation &#224; comparaitre, servie par ce dernier &#224; Moustapha Sow le 15 novembre puis le 16 
d&#233;cembre 2005 devant le Tribunal r&#233;gional Hors Classe de Dakar. Elle s'est achev&#233;e, en 
premier ressort, par le jugement contradictoire du 7 f&#233;vrier 2006, par lequel le Tribunal 
r&#233;gional de Dakar, admettant la culpabilit&#233; de Moustapha Sow, auteur des articles de presse, 
l'a condamn&#233; &#224; une peine d'emprisonnement de six (06) mois ferme.  Tout au long de la 
proc&#233;dure, M. Sow &#233;tait assist&#233; de son conseil, n'&#233;tant pas pr&#233;sent lors du prononc&#233; du 
verdict, pour des raisons qu'il n'a pas eu &#224; indiquer, c'est &#224; bon droit qu'un mandat d'arr&#234;t lui 
a &#233;t&#233; servi pour ex&#233;cution de la sanction &#233;dict&#233;e conform&#233;ment aux articles 122, 449 et 452 
du Code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale. Cette ex&#233;cution est intervenue le 26 juin 2006.  &#192; la demande 
de M. Sow exprim&#233;e devant la Cour d'Appel, le mandat d'arr&#234;t a &#233;t&#233; lev&#233; le 14 juillet 2006 et 
l'affaire a &#233;t&#233; renvoy&#233;e au 1er d&#233;cembre 2006.  Comme on peut l'observer dans cette affaire, 
il ne peut &#234;tre question de d&#233;tention arbitraire qui serait lie fait de l'&#201;tat.  11 appartient au 
parquet d'assurer l'ex&#233;cution des d&#233;cisions sur l'action publique et il est de la responsabilit&#233; 
exclusive du condamn&#233; de relever appel d'une d&#233;cision dont il a connaissance pour avoir 
assist&#233; aux d&#233;bats et entendu la date &#224; laquelle le jugement est rendu. Le Parquet a exerc&#233; 
correctement ses fonctions. Le condamn&#233;, quant &#224; lui, ne s'est manifest&#233; qu'&#224; l'ex&#233;cution de 
la sentence.  Les dispositions l&#233;gales applicables en l'esp&#232;ce y compris celles d&#233;j&#224; 
mentionn&#233;es et concernant la diffamation, sont les suivantes : en ce qui concerne la saisie des 
tribunaux par les particuliers en citation directe: les articles 376, 380 et 396 du Code de 
proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale; en ce qui concerne l'ex&#233;cution du mandat d'arr&#234;t et sa mainlev&#233;e: les 
articles 122, 449 et 452 du Code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale.  Le droit s&#233;n&#233;galais permet ainsi &#224; 
toute personne qui pense avoir subi d&#233;s dommages d&#233;coulant de la commission d'une 
infraction de soumettre directement le cas devant les juridictions comp&#233;tentes, &#224; ses risques 
et p&#233;rils.  Ces principes ont trouv&#233; application dans le d&#233;lit qui a fait l'objet de la 
correspondance des rapporteurs sur la d&#233;tention arbitraire let sur la libert&#233; d'opinion et 
d'expression.  Par ailleurs, aujourd'hui, l'un des d&#233;bats les plus actuels, au S&#233;n&#233;gal, est la 
d&#233;p&#233;nalisation des d&#233;lits de presse. Dans  ce  sens ,  le  19  octobre 2004, Monsieur le 
Pr&#233;sident de la R&#233;publique a marqu&#233; son accord pour la d&#233;p&#233;nalisation des d&#233;lits de presse au 
S&#233;n&#233;gal, tout en invitant les journalistes a formuler des propositions permettant de sanctionner, 
autrement, les d&#233;lits de presse, afin d'assurer un &#233;quilibre entre leurs droits et leurs devoirs.

570. On 20 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, sent an urgent appeal concerning Dr. <b>Chee Soon Juan</b>, the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 208 
 
Secretary- General of the Singapore Democratic Party (S.D.P.) and the chairman of the NGO 
Alliance for Reform and Democracy for Asia ARDA, who is facing a court hearing on 16 March 
2006 for contempt of court. According to the information received, it was reported that Dr. Chee 
Soon Juan had strongly and consistently criticized the Government policies. In 1993, when he 
was a lecturer at the National University of Singapore, he was fired for misusing his research 
funds. It is alleged that this happened because he joined S.D.P. When he disputed the dismissal, 
he was sued by the head of the department of the University and two other staff members for 
defamation, which resulted in a judgment against him for approximately US$ 71,000. On 
November 1995, Dr. Chee was censured by the Parliament for endorsing attacks on the judiciary 
during a Forum held in the United States in September 1995. It is alleged that even if these 
accusations were made by Mr Francis Seow, former solicitor general and Mr Christopher Lingle, 
the Government attributed them to Mr Chee, affirming that his failure to contradict the attacks 
constituted positive assent by &#8220;clever omission&#8221;. In 1996, the Parliament fined him and other 
S.P.D members approximately US$25,000 for contempt Parliament in the context of a health-
care debate. In addition, it is reported that in 1999 Dr. Chee was imprisoned in two occasions for 
making public speeches without a permit. Moreover, Mr Chee was fined S$ 3,000 for speaking 
on a religious topic at Singapore&#8217;s Speaker&#8217;s Corner and S$4,500 under Public Entertainment 
Acts. However, it is reported that he chose to serve a five-week jail term instead of paying these 
fines. In 2001, during the national election campaign, Dr. Chee raised questions about alleged 
government financial support to Indonesia over the previous four years. In response to his 
comments, Dr. Chee was sued for defamation by former Prime Ministers Mr Lee Kuan Yew and 
Goh Chok Tong.  On 11 January 2002, Mr Chee filed an application asking the admission of Mr 
Stuart Littlemore as his attorney. Mr Littlemore is an Australian Queen&#8217;s Counsel and a 
defamation expert. It is alleged that Mr Chee submitted this application because he could not 
find a local lawyer to represent him because they were afraid of Government reprisal. It is 
reported that on 18 January 2002, the High Court ruled that Mr Littlemore was not fit to practice 
in the country, because he had criticized judiciary in an earlier case involving another opposition 
leader, when he was an observer for the International Commission of Jurists. Dr. Chee made a 
second application to admit Hong Kong&#8217;s Martin Lee and Australian William Nicholas, both 
Queen&#8217;s Counsels. It is reported that the tribunal dismissed them, declaring that the case was not 
complex enough to warrant the assistance of Queen&#8217;s Counsels. Moreover, it is alleged that in 
the meantime, Mr Lee Kuan Yew and Mr Goh Chok Tong, engaged a Senior Counsel, which is a 
Singapore&#8217;s equivalent to Queen&#8217;s Counsel, whereas Dr. Chee represented himself. On 19 
August 2002, the court allowed to carry out a summary judgment, which allegedly took place in 
the Registrar&#8217;s private chambers. It is reported that as result of this procedure the two former 
Prime Ministers were awarded approximately US$ 300,000 in damages. Dr. Chee appealed the 
decision, but his appeal was rejected on 4 April 2003.  It is reported that Mr Lee Kuan Yew and 
Mr Goh Chok Tong submitted to the courts a bankrupt petition against Dr. Chee, when he failed 
to pay. It appears that on 10 February 2006, during the bankrupt&#8217;s hearing, Dr. Chee accused the 
judiciary of not being fair and independent, especially when it decides defamation cases 
involving opposition politicians. It is alleged that the courts declared Dr. Chee bankrupt, 
consequence of which is that he would be barred from standing in future elections. Finally, it 
appeared that the Attorney General applied for a hearing to commit Dr. Chee to prison for 
contempt of court and that the trial took place on 16 March 2006. The details of the hearing are 
not yet known. Serious concern was expressed at the Government&#8217;s recourse to criminal 
sanctions for Dr. Chee&#8217;s legitimate exercise of his right to freedom of opinion and expression.

571. On 19 September 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal the 
attention of the Government to information they have received concerning <b>members of civil 
society groups and non-governmental organizations</b>, who wish to attend the annual meetings 
of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund which will take place in Singapore on 19 
and 20 September 2006. Some members include Ms <b>Chona Leah Ramos </b>and<b> </b>Ms <b>Bobbie 
Diciembre </b>from the Philippines; M.r. <b>Wilfred D&#8217;Costa</b>, Mr <b>K Raghu </b>and<b> </b>M.r <b>Biswaranjan 
Mishra </b>and<b> </b>Mr <b>Ashok Bharti </b>from India; Ms <b>Hyekyung Kim </b>from South Korea;, Mr <b>Mohan 
Uranga Rasinghe </b>and Mrs <b>Chandrani Janaki Aramasinghe Comapannage </b>who are<b> </b>Sri 
Lankan members of the <i>Global Call to Action against Poverty</i> (GCAP); <i>Action Aid</i> campaigners, 
Ms <b>Maria Clara Soares </b>(Sri Lanka)<b>, </b>Ms <b>Rose Wanjiru </b>(Kenya),<b> </b>Ms <b>Thao Haong</b> (Vietnam) 
and M.r <b>Rashid Titumir </b>(Bangladesh); and Ms <b>Irma Yanni </b>and<b> </b>Mr<b> Achmad Yakub </b>from 
Indonesia<b>.</b> According to the information received, the Singaporean authorities had agreed that 
permission would be granted to civil society members to attend events at the actual venue of the 
meetings. It was reported that the Singaporean authorities have already detained and deported a 
number of civil society activists including two participants from the Philippines who were 
accredited to attend <i>the Global Call to Action against Poverty</i> (GCAP) gathering in Batam in 
Indonesia. Ms <b>Chona Leah Ramos</b>, member of <i>Jubilee South</i> and Ms <b>Bobbie Diciembre</b>, a 
representative of the <i>Freedom from Debt Coalition</i> were subjected to questioning, inspection of 
their belongings including their mobile phones and laptop computers, and they were 
fingerprinted and photographed before they were deported back to the Philippines. Reports also 
indicate that three Indian delegates were prevented from entering Singapore en route to Batam. 
On 13 September 2006, Mr <b>Wilfred D&#8217;Costa</b>, General Secretary of the <i>Indian Social Action 
Forum </i>(INSAF), who reportedly is in current possession of a two -year multiple entry visa to 
Singapore, was denied entry and deported after a six-hour detention which included an 
interrogation, inspection of his baggage and the confiscation of documents. According to reports, 
another two Indian delegates, Mr <b>K Raghu</b> and Mr <b>Biswaranjan Mishra,</b> representing the 
<i>National Confederation of Officers Associations</i>, were held for 38 hours despite the fact that they 
had been granted transit visas and the remaining three members of their delegation were 
permitted to travel through Singapore on their way to Batam. M.r <b>Ashok Bharti</b>, Coordinator of 
the <i>National Conference of Dalit Organisations</i>, representing Wada no Todo for the GCAP 
Indian campaign, was also detained for five hours. On 13 September 2006, it was reported that 
Ms <b>Hyekyung Kim</b>, Chairperson of the International Affairs Committee of the South Korean 
<i>Citizens&#8217; Coalition for Economic Justice</i>, was deported from Singapore to Seoul at 23.10 p.m. 
after being detained for six hours during which time she was questioned regarding her 
background and intended activities in Batam. It was further reported that two Sri Lankan 
delegates namely Mr <b>Mohan Uranga Rasinghe</b>, media and website coordinator of GCAP Sri 
Lanka Youth, and Mrs <b>Chandrani Janaki and Aramasinghe Comapannage</b>, Campaigner for 
the GCAP Women&#8217;s Sector, were also deported. On15 September 2006, it was reported that Ms 
<b>Maria Clara Soares</b>, <i>ActionAid</i>&#8217;s Policy Director for the Americas region, and former economic 
advisor to the Ministry of Finance in Brazil, was deported as she was on her way to attend the 
peaceful protests organized in Batam. Three of her <i>Action Aid</i> colleagues, Ms <b>Rose Wanjiru</b> 
(Kenya), Ms <b>Thao Haong</b> (Vietnam) and Mr <b>Rashid Titumir </b>(Bangladesh)<b> </b>were detained for 
questioning but were later released after they had been fingerprinted. It was further reported that 
on 18 September 2006, two members of <i>The Federation of Indonesian Peasants Union</i> (FSPI), 
M.r <b>Achmad Yakub</b> and Ms <b>Irma Yani</b>, were detained for approximately fourteen hours in 
Changi airport. The two activists had intended to hold a press conference in Singapore </p>

concerning the IMF and World Bank policies on farmers. They were deported to Jakarta by 
Singaporean authorities after they had been interrogated, photographed and fingerprinted. It had 
further been reported that the Singaporean authorities have prohibited peaceful outdoor 
demonstrations and have insisted that permission must be granted for any indoor events to be 
held by civil society groups in relation to the World Bank/International Monetary Fund 
meetings. Concerns were expressed that the alleged deportation of the aforementioned members 
of civil society and the prohibition on peaceful demonstrations, organized by civil society 
members in Singapore, were an attempt to prevent civil society activists from carrying out their 
legitimate activities in defence of human rights, in particular activities which highlight the 
impact of World Bank and IMF policies on women&#8217;s rights, trade and finance, the environment, 
migrant workers and indigenous people and their right to freedom of peaceful assembly.  
 
<b>Replies from the Government 
</b> 
572. On 31 March 2006, the Government replied to the joint allegation letter sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on 20 March 2006 concerning Dr. <b>Chee Soon Juan</b>, the Secretary General of the 
Singapore Democratic Party (S.D.P.), stating that the information received by the Special 
Rapporteur was not fully accurate and even misleading to some extent. It pointed out that 
Singapore has an open and transparent legal system, enabling critics of the Government and 
political opponents to freely express their views. According to the Government, many opposition 
politicians in Singapore are openly vocal in criticizing the Singapore Government, both within 
and outside Parliament, and are not sued or prosecuted purely because of the expression of their 
views. It however added that no one who commits breaches of the law, including contempt of 
Parliament or contempt of court can, claim immunity from prosecution on account of being a 
politician. Singapore's law of defamation follows the common law model. Those who have been 
defamed without justification have the right to seek legal redress to protect their reputations, 
since according to the Government the right to freedom of speech does not include a right of 
defamation. In the August 2002 proceedings, a defamation order was made summarily by a 
Senior Assistant Registrar in chambers. According to the Government of Singapore, this is a 
standard procedure by a Senior Assistant Registrar in chambers and in many common law 
countries. A plaintiff who feels that the defendant does not have a defence may apply for 
summary judgement under Order 14 of the Rules of Court. In that case, the plaintiff made such 
an application and the Registrar was satisfied that the defendant did not have a defence. The 
Government indicated that on 16 March 2006, the High Court found Dr Chee to be in contempt 
of court. He compounded his contemptuous statement in court and was sentenced to a day's 
imprisonment and fined $6000 (approximately US$3700). Dr Chee chose not to pay the fine and 
was jailed for another seven days in lieu of the fine. The Government asserted that with respect 
to the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, Dr Chee has never been prevented from having 
legal representation. In the most recent proceedings relating to contempt of court, a lawyer 
addressed some issues on his behalf while Dr Chee chose to address the court directly on other 
points. In earlier cases, Dr Chee had applied for Queen's Counsels to represent him. The ad hoc 
admission of Queen's Counsels (QC) in Singapore is provided for by the Legal Profession Act, 
which sets out the conditions for such admissions, one of which is that the difficulty and 
complexity of the case should warrant the employment of a QC. One of Dr. Chee's applications 
was rejected because the case did not comply with this condition. Another application was 
rejected by the court because that QC had, on several previous occasions, made statements that 
showed contempt and disrespect for the Singapore Judiciary, and would thus not have been of </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 211 
 
assistance to the court in its deliberations upon the proceedings. The Government concluded 
stating that Singapore's legal and judicial system is internationally recognised to be independent, 
efficient and honest and that if Dr Chee Soon Juan insisted in intentionally flouting the laws of 
Singapore, he should be prepared to face the courts and answer for his actions. 
</p><p> 
573. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its reply and invites the Government to 
respond to the communication dated 19 September 2006. 
 
</p>
<p><b>Somalia 
 
</b></p>
<p>574. On 27 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning <b>Martin 
Adler</b>, Swedish award-winning freelance journalist and photographer. He was a frequent 
contributer to the <i>UK's Channel 4 News</i>, Swedish daily<i> Aftonbladet</i>, and several other 
newspapers. According to the information received, on 23 June 2006, Mr Adler was fatally shot 
by an unidentified armed man, while he was filming a demonstration in Mogadishu. The 
demonstration was organized by the Islamic Courts Union, and was attended by thousands of 
people in support of a peace agreement reached on 22 June 2006 between the Islamic courts and 
Somalia's transitional government. The participants of the demonstration were also protesting 
against the suggestion that foreign peacekeepers be sent to Somalia. Some demonstrators were 
burning American and Ethiopian flags. Reports indicate that the gunman was clearly targeting 
Mr Adler, and shot him at a close range.  
 
575. On 2 November 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter concerning three 
journalists, <b>Fahad Mohammed Abukar </b>of <i>Warsan Radio</i> in Baidoa, <b>Mohammed Adawe 
Adam</b> of <i>Radio Shabelle</i> and <b>Muktar Mohammed Atosh</b> of <i>HornAfrik</i>, both based in 
Mogadishu, were reportedly arrested in a village near Baidoa by militias loyal to the federal 
Government. According to information received, the journalists were arrested, and their material 
confiscated, because they were working on the alleged presence of Ethiopian troops in Somalia, 
in order to help the federal Government in its effort to fight against the Islamic Courts, which 
control the former capital Mogadishu and a large part of the Somali territory. Fahad Mohamed 
Abukar was subsequently released on 28 October 2006, while the other two journalists are still 
detained. The Special Rapporteur has received supplementary information concerning violence 
against journalists in Somalia. On 28 October 2006, security guards of General Adde Muse, in 
Bossasso, severely beat <b>Idle Moallim Omar</b> who works for the website 
http://www.somaliwyen.com. On 29 October 2006, journalists <b>Abdulkadir Barre Moallim</b> and 
<b>Nur Barre of Radio Warsan</b> were briefly arrested by the police on the orders of the governor of 
the Bay region; because of his dissatisfaction with a <i>Warsan Radio</i> broadcast news relating to the 
activities of the Bay region Council. 
 
<b>Replies from the Government 
</b> 
576. At the time this report was finalized, the Special Rapporteur had not received any replies 
to the communications sent. The Special Rapporteur therefore invites the Government to respond 
to these allegations.

577. El 5 de abril de 2006, el Relator Especial envi&#243; una comunicaci&#243;n con relaci&#243;n al caso del 
peri&#243;dico de lengua vasca <b><i>Euskaldunon Egunkaria</i></b> . De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 
20 de febrero de 2003, este peri&#243;dico fue objeto de una operaci&#243;n policial ordenada por el juez 
Juan del Olmo. En esta operaci&#243;n fueron incautados documentos y ordenadores, y los activos del 
peri&#243;dico fueron congelados. Adem&#225;s, diez personas que eran o hab&#237;an sido empleados del 
peri&#243;dico fueron detenidas y puestas en r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n por un periodo de cinco 
d&#237;as. El 25 de febrero, fueron puestos en libertad <b>Martxelo Otamendi, Inma Gomila, Luis 
Goia y Fermin Lazkano</b>, mientras que ingresaron en prisi&#243;n <b>Joan Mari Torrealdai, I&#241;aki

investigar la presunta vinculaci&#243;n del entramado empresarial del peri&#243;dico con la organizaci&#243;n 
terrorista ETA. En diciembre de 2004, siete de los diez detenidos, <b>I&#241;aki Uria, Joan Mari 
Torrealdai, Txema Auzmendi, Xabier Alegria, Pello Zubiria, Xabier Oleaga </b>y<b> Martxelo

colaborar con, ETA&#8221;. Seg&#250;n se inform&#243;, estos delitos son sancionables con penas de 1 a 14 a&#241;os 
de c&#225;rcel. Todos los periodistas acusados negaron la totalidad de las imputaciones y, el 29 de 
diciembre de 2004, interpusieron un recurso de apelaci&#243;n contra el auto de procesamiento ante la 
sala segunda de la Audiencia Nacional. El 15 de marzo de 2005, el juez Del Olmo orden&#243; la 
liquidaci&#243;n del grupo <i>Egunkaria</i>. El dinero restante obtenido en la gesti&#243;n de la liquidaci&#243;n se

<b>Respuestas del Gobierno 
</b> 
578. Por carta con fecha 11 de abril de 2006 el Gobierno de Espa&#241;a inform&#243; al Relator Especial 
de que la comunicaci&#243;n del 5 de abril de 2006 sobre el peri&#243;dico de lengua vasca <b><i>Euskaldunon 
Egunkaria</i> </b>hab&#237;a sido enviada a las autoridades competentes en Espa&#241;a y que la respuesta se la 
har&#237;a llegar cuando se dispusiera de ella. Al mismo tiempo se asegur&#243; que siendo Espa&#241;a un pa&#237;s 
democr&#225;tico, la lucha contra el terrorismo siempre ha tenido como l&#237;mite y fundamento el 
respeto de los derechos fundamentales. Por carta con fecha 6 de junio de 2006 el Gobierno de 
Espa&#241;a transmiti&#243; la siguiente informaci&#243;n en respuesta a dicha comunicaci&#243;n del 5 de abril de 
2006 sobre el peri&#243;dico de lengua vasca <i>Euskaldunon Egunkaria</i>. El Gobierno espa&#241;ol inform&#243; 
que el cierre del peri&#243;dico se produjo en ejecuci&#243;n de una decisi&#243;n del Juzgado Central de 
Instrucci&#243;n de la Audiencia Nacional en febrero de 2003 como culminaci&#243;n de las 
investigaciones policiales y judiciales practicadas sobre la instrumentalizaci&#243;n de este medio por 
parte de la organizaci&#243;n terrorista ETA para fines delictivos. En  consecuencia las actuaciones 
judiciales realizadas no est&#225;n vinculadas con la garant&#237;a del libre ejercicio del derecho a la 
libertad de opini&#243;n y expresi&#243;n, protegido en la Constituci&#243;n espa&#241;ola.  Respecto a la veracidad

referencias a la sucesi&#243;n de tr&#225;mites de procedimiento pero con errores en las fechas. El gobierno 
a&#241;ade que Egunkaria S.A. se encontrar&#237;a presuntamente en el frente medi&#225;tico creado por ETA, y 
bajo su jerarqu&#237;a militar, con la finalidad de se&#241;alar objetivos terroristas y crear un estado de 
opini&#243;n favorable a los fines de ETA de territorialidad, autodeterminaci&#243;n y la creaci&#243;n de un 
Estado propio.  Seg&#250;n se indic&#243;, el an&#225;lisis de documentos intervenidos a ETA y sus dirigentes 
en el transcurso de operaciones anti-terroristas ponen de manifiesto el control y participaci&#243;n en 
la financiaci&#243;n y Consejo de Administraci&#243;n de Egunkaria S.A. y el control de la l&#237;nea editorial 
del peri&#243;dico. Los indicios sobre la relaci&#243;n entre los &#243;rganos dirigentes del proyecto editorial 
<i>Egunkaria</i> y la banda terrorista ETA est&#225;n incorporados en dos procedimientos judiciales. Sobre 
la duraci&#243;n estimada del proceso, el Gobierno se&#241;ala que la duraci&#243;n del mismo no determina 
por s&#237; misma una dilaci&#243;n indebida y que el juicio sobre si la dilaci&#243;n es o no indebida ha de 
hacerse seg&#250;n las circunstancias, complejidad, pruebas periciales y dem&#225;s factores de cada caso. 
El Gobierno espa&#241;ol afirm&#243; que todas las resoluciones del Juez investigador han resultado 
conforme a la ley y que actualmente el proceso Sumario 44/04 est&#225; en su fase final, por lo que es 
inminente la resoluci&#243;n de conclusi&#243;n del Sumario. Se destac&#243; tambi&#233;n que el auto de 
procesamiento no es una sentencia condenatoria, puesto que no implica un juicio definitivo sobre 
la culpabilidad o inocencia de los imputados-procesados y por lo tanto por su naturaleza el 
procesamiento no puede vulnerar la presunci&#243;n de inocencia. El Gobierno a&#241;adi&#243; que el Auto de 
procesamiento reflej&#243; que exist&#237;an indicios &#8212;que no pruebas&#8212; de una relaci&#243;n entre el 
peri&#243;dico y sus &#243;rganos dirigentes con la banda terrorista ETA. Se indic&#243; que la constituci&#243;n de 
una organizaci&#243;n subordinada a la banda armada pueden ser encuadrados entre los delitos de 
terrorismo, siempre que se llegue a establecer la subordinaci&#243;n de <i>Egunkaria</i> a ETA Las medidas

apoyan en la legislaci&#243;n espa&#241;ola al efecto (art&#237;culo 515, 520 y 129 del C&#243;digo Penal). La 
clausura de una empresa y suspensi&#243;n de sus actividades con car&#225;cter cautelar no est&#225; prohibida 
por la Constituci&#243;n Espa&#241;ola cuando se realiza con el fin de evitar que una organizaci&#243;n

para prevenir la continuidad en la actuaci&#243;n delictiva en los casos de delitos de asociaci&#243;n il&#237;cita. 
Se inform&#243; tambi&#233;n de que el art&#237;culo 121 de la Constitutci&#243;n y la legislaci&#243;n espa&#241;ola prev&#233;n el

580. On 6 January 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning Mr 
<b>Joseph Pararajasingham</b>, leader of the parliamentary group Tamil National Alliance, who was 
murdered on 24 December by unknown gunmen in the cathedral of his home town Batticaloa, 
where he was participating in the midnight Christmas Eve mass with his wife Sugunam, who 
was also seriously wounded in the attack. According to reports received, Mr and  Mrs 
Pararajasingham had not visited their home town Batticaloa in the recent past because of security 
concerns.  Pararajasingham had drawn international attention to the attacks against Tamil 
civilians, including the killing of lawyers and journalists, in the North-East part of the country, </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 214 
 
including the town of Batticaloa, an area in which, despite the Ceasefire Agreement, the ethnic 
and political confrontation continues to be very violent.  
 
581. On 28 February 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning the 
Sinhala-language weekly <b><i>Irudina</i></b>  and its English counterpart <b><i>The Sunday Leader</i></b> . The two 
newspapers have already been the subject of a communication sent on 28 October 2005. 
According to the new information received, on 10 February 2006, the police summoned and 
interrogated members of <i>Irudina</i> and <i>The</i> <i>Sunday Leader</i>, regarding the article on claymore 
mines, which was published by <i>Irudina</i> on 22 January. The focus of the interrogation was the 
management structures of <i>Irudina</i> and <i>The</i> <i>Sunday Leader.</i> Following this investigation, on 11 
February, several members of the weekend newspaper <i>Sathdina</i> were assaulted by an 
unidentified group of men. It is reported that <i>Sathdina</i> staff members were attacked because the 
assailants mistook them as members of <i>Irudina</i>. The assailants told the <i>Sathdina </i>staff members 
that it was forbidden to put  up <i>Irudina</i> posters. The assault ceased once a <i>Sathdina</i> member told 
the assailants that they were not working for <i>Irudina.</i> Concern was expressed that these series of 
events were directly connected with the journalistic work of <i>Irudina</i> and <i>The Sunday Leader</i>. 
Concern was heightened in light of the report that a parliamentarian made a statement on 1 
February 2006, inciting hatred against the editor of <i>The Sunday Leader</i>, accusing him of 
supporting terrorism activities in Sri Lanka.   
 
582. On 4 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning <b>Sivaramya 
Sivanathan</b>, a young female Tamil journalist attached to the Sri Lanka Broadcasting 
Corporation (SLBC). According to the information received, on 1 May 2006, she was arrested at 
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Press 
Freedom Day Conference. Ms Sivanathan was there to report on the conference. She was 
reportedly arrested by the Cinnamon Garden police, for not presenting an official invitation, 
despite the fact that she presented her Press identity card and national identity card. The SLBC 
director has also verified her identity. At the time this communication was sent, she was detained 
at the Welikada Prison, and was called at the court on 5 May 2006. 
 
583. On 7 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning five journalists: 
<b>Sunanda Deshapriya</b> and <b>Sitha Ranjanee</b> of the Free Media Movement; <b>Poddala Jayanthe,</b> of 
the Sri Lanka Working Journalists Association; <b>Dharmasiri Lankapeli,</b> of the Federation of 
Media Employees Trade Unions; and journalist <b>Prasanna Fonseka</b>. Sunanda Deshapriya was 
the subject of an urgent appeal sent on 23 May 2005. According to the information received, the 
five above-mentioned journalists were amongst the representatives of journalist groups who went 
to Kilinochchi to meet with the chief of the Political Wing of the Tamil Tigers on 16 May 2006. 
Reports indicate that they went to raise their concern about the Tamil Tigers' earlier call for 
Tamil journalists to resign from positions in the media affiliated to the Government. Following 
the meeting, several media published articles accusing the five journalists of being Tamil Tiger 
spies. They have subsequently received several phone calls from unidentified individuals, 
threatening that they would be killed.  
 
584. On 6 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning Mr <b>Sampath 
Lakmal de Silva</b>. According to the information received, on 2 July 2006, the freelance 
journalist, <b>Sampath Lakmal de Silva</b> was murdered by an unknown group. He was abducted at 
5.00 a.m. from his parents' home in Borallasgamuwa, south of Colombo, and his body was found </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 215 
 
later on three kilometres away. De Silva, a specialist in defence matters, was a correspondent of 
the weekly &quot;Sathdina&quot; and worked as a full-time journalist until April 2006. He principally 
covered the conflict between the Government and Tamil separatists and there were rumours that 
he could have held and transmitted sensitive information to both sides. His killing comes in a 
context of renewed violence against journalists and media workers: reportedly, six of them have 
been killed in the last 16 months. 
 
585. On 24 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning 
<b>Sathasivam Baskaran</b>, a driver of the <i>Sudar Oli press group</i>, who was gunned down in Jaffna 
on 15 August 2006, while delivering copies of one of its daily newspapers, <i>Uthayan</i>, in a vehicle 
marked with the press sign. Reportedly, he was killed by soldiers. On that same date, a raid was 
carried out on Sudar Oli&#8217;s premises in Colombo by police officers, during which the identity of 
journalists was checked and those from the north were questioned. Allegedly, Suresh Kumar, 
<i>Uthayan</i>'s head of marketing, and Ranjith Kumar, both journalists of Tamil origin, were shot 
dead in an attack on the newspaper in Jaffna on 2 May 2006. According to the information 
reported, the newspaper management gave the authorities the name of a leader of the Tamil 
paramilitary group who was suspected of carrying out the attack, but no investigation was carried 
out. Uthayan Managing Director, Mr Saravanabhavan reported that the security provided to 
Editor Mr N. Vithyatharan and himself was withdrawn on 14 August 2006. 
 
586. On 25 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning 
<b>Sinnathamby Sivamaharajah</b>, Managing Director of Jaffna Tamil daily <i>Namathu Eelanadu</i>, 
who was murdered on 20 August 2006, by unknown gunmen at his residence in Tellippalai, 
Jaffna, inside a high security zone of the Sri Lanka Army (SLA). Mr Sivamaharajah was a 
former parliamentarian (TULF) and a senior member of Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK), the 
main constituent party of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA). He was also very active in the 
cause of resettling internally displaced peoples. In a separate development, on 18 August 2006 
two warehouses belonging to the newspaper <i>Udayan</i>, were burned down by unidentified persons. 
According to the <i>Udayan </i>group of newspapers' general manager, Mr Saravanabhavan, the 
warehouses contained newsprint and electronic equipment worth approximately US$ 28,850. 
<i>Udayan</i> is the most popular and oldest newspaper in the Jaffna peninsula.  In recent times, the 
<i>Udayan </i>group has been the target of death threats and bomb attacks.  
 
587. On 11 September 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegation 
concerning human rights defenders in Sri Lanka, including 17 staff members of the non- 
governmental organization <i>Action Against Hunger (Action Contre la Faim),</i> Mr <b>Ketesh 
Loganathan</b>, Deputy Secretary-General of the Sri Lankan Government Peace Secretariat and 
staff members of the <i>Uthayan</i> and <i>Surdaroli </i>newspapers. According to the information received, 
during the month of August, Mr Ketesh Loganathan was killed. Furthermore, humanitarian 
workers and human rights defenders in Sri Lanka have been subjected to threats, harassment and 
intimidation aimed at preventing them from carrying out their activities in defence of human 
rights. Four staff members of the <i>Uthayan</i> newspaper have been killed and newspaper premises 
have been attacked. Journalists with the <i>Uthayan</i> and S<i>urdaroli</i> newspapers have allegedly been 
prevented from traveling to areas in the north and east of Sri Lanka. According to further 
information received, during the month of August, aid convoys have been prevented from 
delivering essential supplies to internally displaced people by the authorities in Trincomalee. It </p>

was further reported that humanitarian workers in Sri Lanka had been subjected to threats, 
harassment and intimidation aimed at preventing them from carrying out their activities in 
defence of human rights. On 4 August 2006, 17 staff members of <i>Action Against Hunger</i> were 
killed in Muttur, Trincomalee District, Sri Lanka. It was reported that 15 of them had been 
killed, shot in the back of the head, and that their murders followed heavy fighting between Sri 
Lankan government forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on Human Rights Defenders; the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, arbitary and summary executions, and the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, 
Jean Ziegler issued a press release expressing their serious concern over these killings and the 
escalation of violence on 11 August 2006. 
 
588. On 8 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegation 
concerning the arrest and charges brought against <b>Fr Jesuratnam Jude Bernard Omi</b>, Director 
of the Centre for Peace and Reconciliation (CPR) in Jaffna, Sri Lanka. According to the 
information received, on 24 November 2006, Fr Omi was arrested after he intervened in a matter 
concerning, Mr Mariyanayaham Godfry Morris Gnanageethan who had been detained for 
allegedly distributing leaflets issued by the Justice Peace Commission (JPC) concerning the 
humanitarian situation in Jaffna. It is reported that the Mr Mariyanayaham had been queuing for 
food at the 6 CLI army camp when his cousin Ms Alanday Dinosha had spoken with him and 
given him one of the aforementioned leaflets to read. Members of the Sri Lankan Army (SLA) 
reportedly confiscated the leaflet and asked Mr Mariyanayaham questions relating to its origin. 
When he referred to his cousin, members of the army allegedly went to her house in order to 
arrest her. A member of JPC, Fr Francis Xavier Jeyasegaram accompanied Fr Omi, Ms Alanday 
and her mother to the army camp where Mr Mariyanayaham was detained. They were allegedly 
photographed by members of t SLA and threatened by Colonel Manjula who said, &#8220;If you all can 
organise a campaign against the forces we will also do things against you all. You all will face 
the consequences soon&#8221;. After they had left the army camp with Mr Mariyanayaham, the 
Colonel allegedly drove around them on a motorcycle. Later that day, it is reported that Fr Omi 
went to the High Court where Brigade Commander Godipilli stated that Fr Omi and Fr 
Jeyasegaram had distributed the leaflets to people in the queue.  Two soldiers were apparently 
called as witnesses but they never appeared before the court. It was further reported that Fr Omi 
then went to the District Court to record a statement but while there, members of SLA 
surrounded the office of CPR and arrested Fr Jeyasegaram and took him to  CPR. According to 
reports, Fr Omi went to the Human Rights Commission and recorded a statement before he 
reported to the 6 CLI Camp escorted by members of the Non-Violent Peaceforce (NP). The 
sources indicate that  SLA transferred the two priests along with Mr Mariyanayaham, Ms 
Alanday and their parents to the police station in an army vehicle, where they were handed over 
to the police.  Reportedly they all made individual statements, and Ms Alanday was subjected to 
a full body search. On 29 November 2006, the four above-mentioned individuals appeared 
before the Magistrate&#8217;s Court of Jaffna where they were allegedly charged under criminal law 
although they were not informed of the charges brought against them.  They were told that their 
file would be sent to the Attorney General&#8217;s Department and the charges against them should be 
announced by 31 January 2007. They have all reportedly been ordered not to leave the country 
and they will not be permitted to leave Jaffna before the start of the trial. Concern was expressed 
that the arrest of Fr Jesuratnam Jude Bernard Omi may have been related to his defence of the 
right of Mr Mariyanayaham Godfry Morris Gnanageethan and Ms Alanday Dinosha to exercise </p>

their freedom of expression. Further concern was expressed that the charges against him were 
fabricated and he will not receive a fair nor impartial trial. 
 
<b>Replies from the Government 
</b> 
589. By letter dated 17 January and 30 June 2006, the Government of Sri Lanka replied to the 
communication of 6 January 2006 concerning the assassination of. <b>Joseph Pararajasingham</b>, 
leader of the parliamentary group Tamil National Alliance. The Government strongly condemned 
Mr Pararajasigham&#8217;s murder and indicated that the General Police Inspector had been instructed 
to appoint a special investigation team, which started investigating the case on 25 December 
2005. At the time the shooting took place during the midnight mass of 12 December 2005 at St. 
Mary&#8217;s Church in Batticola, security officers of Batticoloa police were with him. According to 
Mr Pararajasingham&#8217;s wife, his decision of attending midnight mass was made short in advance. 
The Government noted that this case led to the LTTE and Karuna factions accusing each other 
for the crime. One witness provided a description of the assailants however, at the moment this 
reply was sent, and in the absence of evidential material, the investigation had come to a 
deadlock though inquiries continued.  
 
590. By letter dated 27 June 2006, the Government of Sri Lanka replied to the communication 
of 7 June 2006 concerning five journalists (<b>Sunanda Deshapriya, Sita Ranjani, Poddala 
Jayanthe, Dharmasiri Lakapeli and Prasanna Fonseka</b>) who received threatening phone 
calls. The Government indicated that the five above-mentioned persons were amongst the 
representatives of a group of journalists who went to Kilinochchi for a meeting with the chief of 
the political wing of the Tamil Tigers. After that meeting there were several media reports 
accusing the said journalists of being Tamil Tigers spies. The Government of Sri Lanka stated 
that it is unknown if the journalists had made a formal complaint about the allegations and that in 
the event an investigation could be conducted. The Government informed about the possibility of 
keeping surveillance on the journalists&#8217; telephones in order to ascertain from where the calls 
originated, and stated that if the journalists did not consent to this method, it would be difficult to 
establish the identity of such callers. The Government reported that it had no control over media 
reports given the independence of the press, other than frequent appeals to the press for restraint 
in the reporting of matters of sensitive political nature. It was also reported that the State has 
allowed self-regulation of the media without any interference. 
 
591. By letter dated 6 October 2006, the Government of Sri Lanka replied to the 
communication of 6 July 2006 concerning the murder of the journalist <b>Sampath Lakmal</b> on 1 
July 2006. The Government informed that the body of Sampath Lakmal was discovered on 2 
July 2006 and the examination was conducted by the Judicial Medical Officer, who established 
the time of the death. It was reported that on 1 July 2006, Sampath Lakmal had met some 
intelligence operatives and according to his mother&#8217;s explanations she received two telephone 
calls that got disconnected before she could answer them. The Government of Sri Lanka 
indicated that inquiries had revealed that Sampath Lakmal had met with a member of the Army 
Intelligence Unit (Lt. Anthony), who gave him information concerning Liberation Tigers of 
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and ordered one Pvt. Kumara from the Welisara Army Camp to meet him. 
They met, went in the direction of Dehiwela and when Sampath suggested to visit Godagama, 
Pvt. Kumara had declined and returned to the Welisara camp. It was also reported that Sampath </p>

Police but the matter had been settled thereafter.  
 
592. By letter dated 14 September 2006, the Government of Sri Lanka replied to the 
communication of 11 September 2006. The Government informed that it condemns the attack on 
the offices of the three <b>international NGOs engaged in humanitarian assistance</b> in Muutur, 
Trincomalee on 21 May 2006, and had ordered an investigation and provided all needed

Thambiah</b>. The Government stated that the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) of Sri 
Lanka Police had commenced an investigation into this complaint under the orders received from 
the Inspector General of Police. The Government indicated that investigations are in progress.  
 
594. By letter dated 19 June 2006, the Government of Sri Lanka responded to the urgent appeal

<b>Ms</b> <b>Lalith Rajapakse. </b>The Government stated that an investigation was initiated by the 
Criminal Investigation Department on 22 November 2004 into the alleged death threats against 
Mr Perera and Mr Liyanage. It was noted that whilst investigations continue, Mr Perera and Ms 
Rajapakse have been provided with 24- hour police protection and that a special police team was 
deployed to protect Ms Rajapakse during her court hearing at the High Court, Negombo on 21 
February 2005. The Government also indicated that police protection has been withdrawn from 
Mr Perera&#8217;s house on his request.  
 
595. By letter dated 23 January 2006, the Permanent Mission of the Democratic Socialist 
Republic Sri Lanka responded to the urgent appeal sent on 2 November 2005 concerning <b>Mr 
Sanjeewa</b>. The Mission stated that the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) of Sri Lanka had 
informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that an official complaint from Mr Sanjeewa regarding

noted that a request had been made by e SIU to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Mr 
Sanjeewa&#8217;s address so that an official statement could be recorded. 
 
<b>Observations 
 
</b>596. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its replies and invites the Government 
to reply to the communications dated 28 February 2006, 4 May 2006, 24 and 25 August 2006, 
and 8 December 2006.

</p>
<p>597. On 27 January 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a number of <b>delegates </b>at a 
<b>non-governmental organization forum</b> in Khartoum, including <b>Faisal al Baqir</b>, a freelance 
journalist and member of the organization Reporters Sans Fronti&#232;res and associated with the 
Sudanese Organization Against Torture (SOAT) and Dr. <b>Nagib Najmedin</b>, director of the Amal </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 219 
 
Centre and the Khartoum Centre for Human Rights. Mr al Baqir was the subject of an allegation 
letter sent on 6 September 2004. The NGO forum had brought together national and international 
NGO&#8217;s, two representatives from the United Nations and representatives from the European 
Union. The NGO Forum was being held at the same time as Summit of the African Union in 
Khartoum. According to the information received, on 23 January 2006 at approximately 6 
p.m.m, security forces entered the building where the NGO forum was being held. It was 
reported that security forces then ordered the delegates to hand over all documents and laptops. 
Some of the delegates resisted these demands, and it is reported that some of them were pushed 
and threatened by the security forces. It is also reported that still and digital photographs and 
video material were forcibly taken from the delegates by the security forces. It is alleged that a 
crowd of journalists and diplomatic representatives that had gathered outside the building while 
these events were taking place were prevented from entering by the security forces. At 
approximately 9 p.m., it was reported that security forces attempted to release delegates who 
were representing international organizations, but not Sudanese nationals. International delegates 
resisted these attempts and finally all delegates were released. Concern was expressed that the 
detention of NGO delegates including Faisal al Baqir and Nagib Najmedin was a deliberate 
attempt to prevent them from carrying out their legitimate activities in defence of human rights.   
 
598. On 20 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur jointly with the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences and the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on the situation of human rights defenders sent <b>Sudan Social Development 
Organization</b> (SUDO), a humanitarian and development non-governmental organization which 
works in West Darfur, Sudan. SUDO also monitors human rights violations in Darfur and assists 
women who have suffered gender -based violence as a result of the conflict in Darfur. According 
to the information received, on 11 March 2006 the Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC), a 
Government agency, issued a formal notice to the directors of SUDO in Zaillingiee and Geneina, 
ordering the suspension of all its activities within West Darfur. It was reported that the directors 
of SUDO were ordered to hand over all the assets of the organization and to close down its 
health and nutrition centres and its food distribution unit. It was alleged that the legal grounds for 
this suspension based in the &#8220;Organization of Humanitarian and Voluntary Work Act&#8221;, but HAC 
did not specify which provisions of the Act SUDO had violated. This legislation was the subject 
of an urgent appeal sent on 16 November 2005. In that communication, concern was expressed 
regarding the powers granted to HAC by this legislation, particularly regarding powers to 
suspend NGO activities, dissolve their executive committee and replace it with a transitional 
committee, cancel registration, and expel International NGOS from the Sudan upon approval 
from the Minister, without judicial review. Concern was expressed that the suspension of the 
activities of SUDO was connected with its work in defence of human rights and will prevent it 
from carrying out its humanitarian and development work. 
 
599. On 10 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture 
regarding <b>Osman Hassan Al-masri</b>, General Secretary of the Beja Congress in Gadarif State  
(arrested on 6 March 2006), <b>Alamin Alhaj</b>, Chairperson of the Beja Congress in Gadarif State 
(arrested on 6 March 2006), <b>Ali Hussain Omer</b>, Member of the Beja Congress Secretariat in 
Kassala State (arrested on 7 March 2006 &#8211; transferred form security detention to Kassala Prison, 
began a hunger strike on 26 March 2006), <b>Ali Omer</b>, Member of the Beja Congress Secretariat 
in Kassala State (arrested on 8 March 2006), <b>Mahmoud Ibrahim Osman</b>, Assistant General </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 220 
 
Secretary of the Beja Congress in Kassala State (arrested on 10 March 2006), <b>Ali Omer 
Mohamed Ali</b>, Member of the Eastern Front (arrested on 7 March 2006, began a hunger strike 
on 26 March 2006), <b>Haroun Mohamed Ali</b>, Member of Eastern Front (arrested on 7 March 
2006, began a hunger strike on 26 March 2006), <b>Mohamed Din Suleiman</b>, Chairperson of the 
Secretariat of the Beja Congress in Kassala State (arrested on 3 April 2006), <b>Gafar Mohamed 
Adam</b>, General Secretary of the Beja Congress in Kassala State General (arrested on 3 April 
2006, previously arrested on 10 March 2006), <b>Mohamed Osman Alkhalifa</b>, Member of the 
Beja Secretariat in Kassala State (arrested on 3 April 2006), <b>Hashim Hangag</b>, Lawyer, 
Spokesperson for the Beja Congress in Kassala State (arrested on 04 April 2006, previously 
arrested on 10 March 2006), and. <b>Alamin Alfaidabi</b>, Member of the Secretariat (arrested on 4 
April 2006). According to the information received, on 6, 7 and 8 March 2006, Osman Hassan 
Al-masri, Alamin Alhaj, Ali Hussain Omer, Ali Omer, Mahmoud Ibrahim Osman, Ali Omer 
Mohamed Ali and Haroun Mohamed Ali were arrested by the National at their homes in the Red 
Sea state, Kassala. Gadarif states in what appeared to be a mass arrest of leading members of the 
Beja Congress in Red Sea state, Kassala and Gadarif states by security officers.  At the time this 
communication was sent, they were held incommunicado, without charges, in unknown locations 
in the area. Ali Hussain Omer, Ali Omer Mohamed Ali and Haroun Mohamed Ali had been on 
hunger strike since 2 April 2006 in protest at their continued detention. On 3 and 4 April 2006, 
Mohamed Din Suleiman, Gafar Mohamed Adam, Mohamed Osman Alkhalifa, Hashim Hangag 
and Alamin Alfaidabi were arrested in similar conditions by security officers in Kassala State, 
Eastern Sudan. No reason was given for the arrests and detention. Concern had been expressed 
that the wave of arrests aimed at intimidating the Beja Congress from participating in the at that 
time ongoing peace negotiations in Asmara, Eritrea with the government under the auspices of 
the United Nations. 
 
600. On 24 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur and the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on the situation of human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal regarding the non 
governmental organization <b>Women Awareness Raising Group- Red Sea</b> (AWOON Red Sea). 
AWOON Red Sea provides legal assistance and legal advice to women in Port Sudan, Sudan. 
According to the information received, on 11 April 2006, the Humanitarian Aid Commission 
(HAC) issued a formal letter to AWOON Red Sea, notifying the organization that its assets 
would be frozen. It was reported that  HAC invoked the Humanitarian Aid Commission Act 
1988 as the legal basis for freezing the assets of AWOON Red Sea, and that under this Act, 
AWOON Red Sea&#8217;s activities were illegal because AWOON Red Sea had submitted a funding 
application to the European Union without first seeking approval of HAC. It is further reported 
that HAC made reference to the &#8220;Organization of Humanitarian and Voluntary Work Act&#8221; to 
further justify the closure of AWOON Red Sea. Grave concern was expressed that the freezing 
of the assets of AWOON Red Sea may have been a deliberate attempt to prevent it from carrying 
out its activities in defence of human rights and result in its effective closure. Furthermore, 
serious concern was expressed that this may have formed part of a campaign on the part of the 
Sudanese authorities to prevent non-governmental organizations from carrying out their 
activities in defence of human rights. These concerns are heightened by the fact that on 11 March 
2006, the activities of the Sudan Social Development Organization (SUDO), a humanitarian and 
development non-governmental organization which works in West Darfur, Sudan, were 
suspended. This suspension of activities was the subject of an urgent appeal sent on 20 March 
2006.

601. On 25 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur joinly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the 
right to an adequate standard of living, sent an urgent appeal concerning <b>Naser Eldien Ahmed 
Altayeb</b>, journalist working for the Arabic daily <i>Alayam</i>. According to the information received, 
on 16 August 2006, Naser Eldien Ahmed Altayeb<b> </b>was arrested by the police, taken to a nearby 
vehicle and allegedly beaten by police officers. As a result, he was hospitalized at the Khartoum 
Teaching Hospital. Naser Eldien was reporting on the forced relocation of residents in Dar al 
Salaam, Algazera province, mainly internally displaced persons (IDPs) from Southern Sudan and 
Darfur who have resided in the area for over two decades. Concerns were expressed that the 
arrest and beating of Naser Eldien Ahmed Altayeb occured because of his activities in defence of 
human rights, in particular the right not to be forcibly evicted. 
 
602. On 30 August 2006, <b>Paul Salopek</b>, a correspondent for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; daily 
newspaper, his driver, <b>Suleiman Abakar Moussa</b> and his interpreter, <b>Abdulraman Anu </b>have 
been held in detention since 6 August 2006. Reportedly, they have been recently charged with 
spying, disseminating illegal information and entering Sudan illegally - crimes punishable by 
long prison terms under the Sudanese criminal code. Mr Salopek was allegedly working on a 
report about the Sahel region for the &#8220;National Geographic&quot; magazine when he was arrested with 
his driver and interpreter on 6 August 2006.  
 
603. On 8 September 2006, the Special Rapporteur, the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working 
Group on Arbitrary Detention, and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights defenders sent  concerning two demonstrations planned to take place in 
Khartoum on 30 August 2006 and in Kosti on 2 September 2006 organized by a variety of 
political opposition groups and trade unions against the recent increases in the prices of some 
items and a demonstration that took place on 6 September 2006 in Khartoum. According to the 
information received, on 30 August 2006 and prior to the demonstration, four activists of various 
political parties and one journalist were arrested in Khartoum, and later taken to Khartoum North 
security offices (Political Section). Mr <b>Sattiaa Mohamed Alhag</b>, lawyer and member of the 
Arab Nassrist Party, and Mr <b>Alhag Warrag Sid Ahmed</b>, column writer with the <i>Alsahafa</i> daily 
and former Chairperson of &#8220;The New Forces Movement&#8221; (HAQ), were detained without 
interrogation for ten hours and released without charge on the same day. Reportedly, the 
whereabouts of the other three detainees, Mr <b>Ibrahim Ahmed Alsheikh</b>, member of the 
Sudanese National Congress Party, Mr <b>Alfatih Omer Alsaied</b>, member of the Sudanese 
National Congress Party, and Mr <b>Mohamed Dia-aldin</b>, member of the Baathist Arab Party 
remained unknown. On that same date, Sudanese police and security forces violently broke up 
the demonstration, blocked access to the &#8220;green tomb square&#8221; where it was taking place, and 
closed access roads. Eyewitness accounts suggested that protestors were beaten and dispersed by 
armed riot police who shelled the area with tear gas. Mr <b>Sidig Mahgoub Munawar</b> reportedly 
suffocated to death from the effects of the tear gas. It was reported that authorities had denied 
permission to hold the demonstration. During the incident, and according to the information 
received, at least 35 protestors and bystanders were arrested. On August 31, 2006, those arrested 
were brought before three courts in Khartoum and charged under articles 67 (rioting) and 69 
(disturbance of public peace) of the 1991 Penal Code. In all, 11 individuals were found guilty 
and 25 were released after having been found not guilty or in the absence of valid charges. 
Reportedly, Mr <b>Surag -aldin Yousif</b> and Mr <b>Suleiman Tahir</b> as well as Mr <b>Mohamed </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 222 
 
<b>Suleiman Hor</b> and Mr <b>Mohamed Omer Idris</b> were sentenced to two and one- months' 
imprisonment respectively. Mr <b>Alamin Idris Awad</b>, Mr <b>Mohieldin Hasan Altahir</b>, Mr 
<b>Abdullah Abdelsalam</b> and Mr <b>Higazi Ali</b> were sentenced to a fine of SD. 30000 or a one-month 
imprisonment. Additionally, Mr <b>Alsadig Hassan</b>, Ms <b>Nazik Izzeldin</b> <b>Abass</b> and Mr <b>Ibrahim 
Atta-almannan Al-zubair</b> were sentenced to a fine of 10.000 SD or one-month imprisonment. 
Reportedly, additional trials were ongoing at the time the communication was sent. Regarding 
the demonstration planned for 2 September 2006 in Kosti city, the organizers were informed on 
1 September  by the Security Committee in Kosti that the permission to hold the protest on the 
next day had been withdrawn for security reasons, although it had been previously granted by the 
same Committee. In a separate incident, on 6 September 2006, Security and Police forces in 
Khartoum arrested <b>56 men</b> <b>and an unknown number of women</b> including human rights 
defenders and political activists who were taking part in a peaceful demonstration in Khartoum. 
Among the detainees there were human rights defenders and political activists including: 
<b>Moniem Eljack</b>, <b>Bushra Alsayim</b> and <b>Marwa Mamoun Alhaj</b>, who were awaiting trial, <b>Sidiq 
Alsaddig Al Mahdi </b>and <b>Mariam Alsaddig Al Mahadi</b>, who were respectively sentenced to one 
month and two months' imprisonment respectively as well as Dr. <b>Murtada Alghali</b> and <b>Sara 
Nugdalla</b>, who were tried and released on 7 September 2006. Reportedly, a number of the male 
detainees were manhandled and beaten during arrest and transfer from Abu Jinzair Police Station 
to Algism Alshimili Police Station. The detainees, who are currently detained in Khartoum North 
Court, are awaiting trial. It was reported that non of the 56 defendants detained in the cell have 
been informed of charges against them and have not been granted access to legal advice, despite 
the presence of several lawyers waiting outside of the court to provide advice and representation. 
Serious concern was expressed that the arrest and trial of these human rights defenders was 
linked to their activities in defence of human rights, and formed part of a campaign of 
harassment and intimidation against human rights defenders in Sudan. 
 
604. On 19 September 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning 
<b>Mohammed Taha</b>, editor-in chief of the private daily <i>Al-Wifaq</i>, who was kidnapped on 5 
September 2006 by masked gunmen outside his home in east Khartoum. A day after, police 
found his severed head next to his body in the south of the capital. Reportedly, Mohammed Taha 
had written critically about the political opposition and armed groups in west Darfur region. In 
May 2005 he was detained for several days, fined US$3.200 and his paper was closed for three 
months for having republished and article from the Internet regarding Prophet Muhammad. 
Demonstrators outside the court demanded death penalty for blasphemy. On 11 September 2006, 
security officers visited the offices of <b><i>al Sahafa</i> </b>daily newspaper and ordered that a number of 
articles and columns be removed prior to printing. Two articles removed related to a meeting 
convened by journalists to discuss the abduction and murder of the above-mentioned journalist.. 
On the evening of 6 September 2006, security officers from the Press and Media Department of 
the National Security Bureau visited the print room of <b><i>Ray al Shaap</i></b>  daily newspaper and 
ordered the removal of references to demonstrations which had been held earlier on the same day 
in Khartoum. Security Officers ordered the removal of the front page headline and the entirety of 
text on page three of the paper. The paper went to print without a front page headline nor page 
three. On a separate event, on 9 September 2006 the Sudanese authorities confiscated all copies 
of <b><i>al-Sudani</i></b>  newspaper, allegedly aiming at preventing the publication of articles that would 
compromise the investigation on Mr Taha's death. It was as well reported that Sudanese 
authorities had expressed their &quot;reservations&quot; about the coverage of current issues by the </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 223 
 
newspaper. Reportedly, the edition confiscated included articles regarding the recent banned 
demonstrations against a rise of oil and sugar prices.  
 
<b>Replies from the Government 
 
</b>605. By letter dated 28 October 2006, the Government of Sudan replied to the communication 
of 19 September 2006, indicating that the freedom of opinion and expression in Sudan is 
defended and protected in the Interim Constitution and law. The Government informed that, in 
the aftermath of the crime of the journalist <b>Mohammad Taha</b>, the authorities prohibited the 
publication of articles that may have interfered with the investigation on Mr Taha&#8217;s death. It was 
also reported by the Government that some newspaper violated such prohibition and accordingly 
articles like those mentioned in the communication were barred from publication.  
 
606. By letter dated 8 May and 2 August 2006, the Government replied to the communication 
of 10 April 2006. The Government noted that <b>Osman Hassan Al-Masri</b> and <b>Alamin Alhaj</b> were 
arrested in the Sudanese-Eriterian border for suspicion of their identity, but were later on 
released after their identity was verified during the interrogation. Regarding <b>Ali Hussain Omer 
and Ali Omer Mohamed, </b>they were arrested on 7 March 2006 for supporting the armed branch 
of Albiga Congress and charged with the offence of collaboration with Beja Armed Organization 
and with Eritrea. They were released after the investigation proved no charges against them. 
<b>Mohamed Din Suleiman, Gafar Mohamed, Hashim Hangag, Alamin Alfaidabi</b> and 
<b>Mohamed Osman Alkhalifa</b> were arrested on 28 March 2006 for inciting people to protest 
against the existence of police camp (anti-smuggling) inside the state of Kasala, being released 
the next day, on 29 March 2006. The Government stressed that none of the abovementioned 
persons were tortured. 
 
607. By letter dated 2 August 2006, the Government replied to the communication of 24 April 
2006 concerning the non-governmental organization <b>Women Awareness Raising Group</b> 
(AWOON). The Government explained that AWOON is registered with the Humanitarian Aid 
Commission (HAC), which provides legal assistance to women in Port Sudan. The Government 
noted that AWOON contravened the law (section 15/2 of the Humanitarian Aid Act 1995) for 
funding a project without HAC&#8217;s permission. The project was funded by EU and aimed at 
strengthening the capacity of civil society in human rights. The Government concluded that for 
these reasons HAC decided to freeze the bank accounts and activities of AWOON.<b>

609. On 21 February 2006, the Special Rapporteur joinly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture 
sent an urgent appeal regarding two university students, Mr <b>Ali Nazeer Mustafa</b> and Mr <b>Husam 
Ali Mulhim</b>, who were allegedly arrested by Air Force Intelligence officers in Damascus, on 26 </p>

January 2006, allegedly at the Air Force Intelligence Branch in Harasta, near Damascus, and no 
formal charges against them were known to have been raised. Considering that Ali Nazeer 
Mustafa and Husam Ali Mulhim are allegedly held incommunicado at an undisclosed location, 
there were concerns that they might have been at risk of torture or other ill-treatment. Concern 
were expressed that the reason for their arrest and detention was their participation in pro-
democracy discussions with fellow students. This concern was corroborated by reports that two 
other students who were part of those discussions were arrested for several hours on 14 February 
2006 and were now obliged to present themselves twice a day for interrogation at the Air Force 
Intelligence Branch in Harasta. 
 
610. On 6 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent 
an urgent appeal regarding <b>Ali al-Abdullah</b>, a journalist writing for several Arab newspapers, 
including <i>Al Nahar</i>, <i>Al Hayat</i> and <i>Al Quds En Arabi</i>, and a member of the Atassi Forum. Ali al-
Abdullah had been already arrested on 26 May 2005 and his case was the subject of a 
communication dated 6 July 2005. According to the Government&#8217;s response dated 29 December 
2005, Ali al-Abdullah was released from detention on 4 November 2005. Unfortunately, this 
communication did not address the concerns expressed in  the letter of 6 July 2005, i.e. that his 
alleged detention &#8211; first incommunicado and then in solitary confinement &#8211; might have placed 
him at risk of torture or other forms of ill-treatment, and that his detention might have violated 
his rights to freedom of opinion and expression and to speak and act for the promotion of human 
rights. According to the allegations received, on 23 March 2006 Ali al-Abdullah and his son 
Mohammad were arrested at their home in Ktene, south of Damascus. It was not known whether 
the officials carrying out the arrest showed an arrest warrant or other document justifying the 
deprivation of liberty and setting forth the charges against the two men. It is also not known 
where the two men were being detained at the time this communication was sent. As a 
consequence, concerns were expressed that Ali al-Abdullah and his son Mohammed might have 
been at risk of torture or other ill-treatment.  
 
611. On 11 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges 
and lawyers, and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, sent an urgent appeal 
concerning <b>Mohammed Ghanem</b>, a novelist and journalist, resident in Ar-Rika, North Syria. 
According to the information received Mohammed Ghanem was arrested by officers of an armed 
patrol of the Syrian Military Intelligence Department (SMID) at his residence in Ar-Rika on 31 
March 2006. SMID immediately transferred him to Damascus, where he is currently detained in 
the &#8220;Palestine Branch&#8221; of the Military Intelligence Security (Branch 235). It is not known 
whether he has been charged with any offense, and he has not been allowed to meet either his 
lawyer or members of his family.The Special Rapporteurs are concerned that his detention might 
be due to his having posted articles denouncing human rights violations in Syria on his website 
&#8220;Souriyoun&#8221;. Considering his allegedly incommunicado detention, there is also the concerne that 
he might be at risk of torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment.

an urgent appeal concerning Mr <b>Fateh Jamus</b>, a human rights defender and pro-democracy 
activist. According to the information received, on 1 May 2006, Mr Fateh Jamus was arrested 
and detained by State Security Officers at Damascus Airport, Syria. He had just returned from a 
trip to Europe during which he had spoken at an Amnesty International conference about human 
rights and asylum issues. He is currently being held in incommunicado detention at State 
Security Branch 255 in Damascus. Grave concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of 
Mr Fateh Jamus may have been connected with his activities in defence of human rights, in 
particular because of his peaceful advocacy for democratic reform in Syria. In the light of his 
incommunicado detention, further concern was expressed that he may have been at risk of torture 
or ill-treatment. 
 
613. On 17 May 2006, the Special Rapporteu,r joinly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent  
an urgent appeal regarding Mr <b>Michel Kilo</b>, president of the <i>Organization for the Defence of 
Freedom of Expression and the Press</i>, an organization that advocates for the right of freedom of 
expression and opinion in Damascus; and a journalist with <i>al-Quds</i>, an Arabic paper that is 
published in London. According to the information received, on 14 May 2006, Mr  Kilo was 
summoned to meet with the Syrian intelligence services. It was reported that since that date he 
had been in incommunicado detention and his whereabouts were unknown. It was reported that 
Mr Kilo had recently signed a petition calling for improvement of relations between Syria and 
Lebanon. Concern was expressed that the above events may have been connected with Mr Kilo&#8217;s 
activities in defence of the right to freedom of expression and opinion in Syria. In light of his 
incommunicado detention, further concern was expressed regarding his physical and 
psychological integrity. 
 
614. On 19  May 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges

Future&#8221;, Mr <b>Mahmoud Issa</b>, former political prisoner, and Mr <b>Nidal Darwish</b>, board member of 
the Defence Commission for Human Rights and Democratic Freedoms in Syria. According to 
the information received, on 31 March 2006 Mr Ghanem was arrested at his home in al-Raqqah 
by military intelligence officers. He was immediately transferred to Damascus and detained in 
the &quot;Palestine Branch&quot; of the Military Intelligence Security (Branch 235). On 15 May 2006, he 
appeared before a military court in the northern town of al-Raqqah on charges of publishing false 
news about human rights violations committed by the Syrian authorities. He was then transferred 
to al-Raqqah al-Markazi prison where he remains in detention. Mr Ghanem, who had been 
previously arrested and detained for 15 days by military intelligence officers in March 2004, has 
not been allowed to see his lawyer or his family since his arrest. On 16 May 2006, Mr Nidal 
Darwish and Mr Mahmoud Merri were arrested and detained by Syrian security forces in 
Damascus. Furthermore, on 17 May 2006, Mr Anwar Al Bunni, Mr Sulieman Al Shamr, Mr </p>

Ghaleb Ammar, Mr Sulieman Al Shamr, Mr Khalil Hussein, Mr Mahmoud Issa and Mr Abbas 
Abbas were arrested and detained by security forces in Damascus. Their whereabouts remained 
unknown at the time this communication was sent, and reportedly they had no access to their 
families or to legal representation since their arrest. It was reported that they had all recently 
signed a petition calling for improvement of relations between Syria and Lebanon. Grave 
concern was expressed that the above arrests and detentions were connected with the activities of 
the above- named people in defence of human rights, in particular their activities in defence of 
the right of freedom of opinion and expression in Syria. 
 
615. On 2 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges 
and lawyers, and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an 
urgent appeal regarding Mr <b>Michel Kilo</b>, president of the Organization for the Defence of 
Freedom of Expression and the Press, an organization that advocates for the right to freedom of 
expression and opinion in Damascus; and a journalist with al-Quds, an Arabic paper that is 
published in London, Mr <b>Anwar Al Bunni</b>, human rights lawyer and member of the Syrian 
Organization for Human Rights, Mr <b>Ghaleb Ammar</b>, board member of the Arab Organization 
for Human Rights (AOHR), Mr <b>Mahmoud Merri</b>, secretary of AOHR, Mr <b>Sulieman Al 
Shamr</b>, member of the National Democratic Coalition, Mr <b>Abbas Abbas</b>, a journalist, Mr 
<b>Khalil Hussein</b>, leader of the organization &#8220;Kurdish Future&#8221; an organization that defends the 
rights of the Kurdish population in Syria, Mr <b>Mahmoud Issa</b>, former political prisoner, and Mr 
<b>Nidal Darwish</b>, board member of the Defence Commission for Human Rights and Democratic 
Freedoms in Syria. Mr Michel Kilo was the subject of an urgent appeal sent on 17 May 2006. Mr 
Al Bunni, Mr Ammar, Mr Merri, Mr Al Shamr, Mr Abbas, Mr Hussein, Mr Issa and Mr Darwish 
were the subjects of an urgent appeal sent on 19 May 2006. According to the information 
received, the above-mentioned people were arrested on 17 and 18 May 2006, and were detained 
in Adra prison in Damascus. They were charged with &#8220;weakening nationalist feelings and 
inciting racial or sectarian strife&#8221;, under article 285 of the Syrian Penal Code. These charges 
allegedly related to a petition calling for the improvement of relations between Syria and 
Lebanon, which was signed by the above-named individuals. Should they be convicted of these 
charges, they may face sentences of up to 15 years&#8217; imprisonment. It was reported that during 
their interrogation they were beaten by prison officers and that at the time this communication 
was sent, they had been allowed to meet with their lawyers only once since their arrest. Mr 
Anwar Al Bunni had allegedly been on hunger strike since his arrest on 17 May 2006 in protest 
at his arrest and detention. It wass reported that he was in a weakened state of health. Grave 
concern was expressed that these charges were related to the activities of the above named 
people in defence of human rights, in particular because of their defence of the right to freedom 
of expression and opinion. Further concern was expressed that they were being denied adequate 
access to legal representation. 
 
616. On 28 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning Mr 
<b>Muhammad Ghanem</b>, online journalist at the news website <i>Surion</i>. He was a subject of the 
communication sent on 19 May 2006, to which no reply had been received. According to the 
new information received, Mr Ghanem was found guilty by a military court on 6 June 2006 of 
insulting the president, undermining the state's dignity, and inciting sectarian divisions. The 
charge stems from his critical articles published on line. In those articles, he advocated political </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 227 
 
and cultural rights for Syria's Kurdish minority, and he has been critical of the ruling Baath 
party's handling of domestic issues. Reports indicate that Ghanem was sentenced to a one year in 
jail but the judge commuted his sentence to six months for unknown reasons. Concern was 
expressed at the authority's recourse to criminal sanctions against Mr Ghanem for his writings 
advocating political and cultural rights for Kurdish minority.  
 
617. On 30 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegation 
concerning Mr <b>Radwan Ziadeh</b>, Director of the Damascus Centre for Human Rights Studies in 
Damasus, Syria. According to the information received, on 26 June 2006 Mr Ziadeh was 
allegedly stopped by Syrian security forces at the border between Syria and Jordan and 
prevented from crossing the border, while he was on his way to participate in an international 
conference entitled &#8220;Human rights within the framework of Criminal Justice: current challenges 
and needed strategies in the Arab World&#8221;, organised by the Amman Centre for Human Rights 
Studies (ACHRS), which was due to take place in Jordan from 27 to 29 June 2006. It was alleged 
that Mr Ziadeh was not given any reason as to why he was prevented from leaving Syria and that 
he was told to report to the General Security Administration (Al-moukhabarat). It was also 
reported that, on 26 June 2006, members of the Syrian security forces went to Mr 
RadwanZiadeh&#8217;s house in Damascus and questioned his brother Mrr about the reasons for Mr 
Radwan Ziadeh&#8217;s travel to Jordan. Concerns were expressed that Mr Radwan Ziadeh was 
allegedly prevented from travelling to Jordan in order to prevent his participation in the above-
mentioned conference, and to restrict his activities in defence of human rights.  
 
618. On 23 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, 
and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding the arrest of Mr <b>Ali Shahabi</b>, an intellectual, a writer 
and a teacher, who had been involved in promoting fundamental freedoms and democracy in 
Syria by taking part in public discussions forums, sit-ins and meetings dedicated to the defence 
of human rights. He was also the author of several articles on political and social issues 
published on the website <i>Hiwar al-Mutamedn</i> (&#8216;Civilised Dialogue&#8217;), and has had two books 
published in Syria on social affairs. According to the information received, on 10 August 2006 at 
10am, Mr Shahabi was reportedly summoned to the State security services in Damascus, as it 
had been regularly the case over the last past months. He has not been seen or heard of since 
then. On 12 August 2006, Mr Shahabi&#8217;s wife enquired about him at the State Security centre at 
Kafr Soussa, Damascus, and was told that he was being held there, but that she could not see 
him. No explanation was reportedly given for his summons or continuing detention. On 17 
August 2006, Mr Shahabi&#8217;s wife tried a second time to visit him, but again was reportedly 
denied access to him, although security officers did take some personal items from her which 
they said they would give to him. She was told to make an official application to get permission 
to see him and to return again in another week. Mr Shahabi has reportedly not been charged with 
any offence. The conditions of his detention are unknown. Serious concerns have been expressed 
that Mr Shahabi&#8217;s arrest was linked to his various activities in the defence of human rights, and 
may form part of a campaign of harassment and intimidation against human rights activists in the 
country.

undermining the state's dignity, and inciting sectarian divisions&#8221;.  The judge later commuted his 
sentence to six months. Mr Ghanem had written many articles advocating political and cultural 
rights for Syria's Kurdish minority and has been vocal on the Baath Party's handling of domestic 
issues. He had already been detained for almost one month in March 2004 because of his articles 
on the activities of the Syrian army and intelligence services against the Kurdish minority. Mr 
Ghanem has been the subject of two previous communications on 29 June 2006 on 19 May 2006.

Abdulrahman</b> and <b>Ali Sayed al-Shihabi</b>. According to the reports received, on 7 September 
2006, Muhened Abdulrahman, a journalist working for independent news sites <i>Rezgar</i> and 
<i>Syrianforum</i>, was arrested by security services in Damascus on his return from the village of 
Qamishly, where he had interviewed a Kurdish political leader. Since then, his whereabouts are 
unknown. Mr Abdulrahman had posted in Internet numerous interviews and profiles of Syrian 
political figures. He had also urged diplomats in posts in Damascus to intervene on behalf of 
Habib Saleh, Mohammed Ghanem and Ali Sayed al-Shihabi, other three online journalists now 
imprisoned in Syrian jails. On 10 August 2006, Ali Sayed al-Shihabi, editorialist on the site 
<i>Rezgar</i>, was summoned to a meeting with State Security agents in Damascus. He has not been 
seen since then. On 12 August Mr Al-Shihabi&#8217;s wife enquired about him at the State Security 
centre at Kafr Soussa, in Damascus. She was told that Mr Al-Shihabi was being held there but 
she was not allowed to see him. Reportedly, he was not charged with any offence and no 
explanation has been given for his detention. Mr Al-Shihabi&#8217;s had posted articles on political and 
social issues on the website <i>Hiwar al-Mutamedn</i>. He had also published two books on social 
affairs. Besides being summoned many times in the past, he had been imprisoned for a year in 
1975 and for nine years from 1982 to 1991 for being a member of the outlawed Communist 
Party of Syria. 
 
621. On 25 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning 
information they have received regarding Mr <b>Michel Kilo</b>, president of the Organization for the 
Defence of Freedom of Expression and the Press and a journalist with al-Quds, an Arabic paper 
that is published in London, and Mr <b>Anouar Al Bunni</b> founding member of the Syrian Human 
Rights Association (ASDH) and member of the Committee for the Defence of Prisoners of 
Conscience. According to the information received, Mr Kilo and Mr Al Bunni, at the time this 
communication was sent, were detained at the Adra prison and faced charges of &#8220;undermining 
national pride&#8221; and &#8220;incitement to racial and sectorial hatred&#8221;under article 285 of the Penal 
Code. Allegedly these charges relate to a petition calling for the improvement of relations 
between Syria and Lebanon, which was signed by the above-named individuals. If convicted of

Kilo and Mr Al Bunni had been arrested in May 2006, along with other human rights defenders 
and political activists, after signing the &#8220;Beirut-Damascus Declaration&#8221;, a petition drawn up by 
Syrian and Lebanese intellectuals and activists calling for the improvement of the relations 
between the two countries. Mr Kilo and Mr Al Bunni were the subject of an urgent appeal on 17 
May 2006 of 19 May 2006 respectively, as well as an urgent appeal on 2 June 2006.  Concern 
was expressed that the arrests and charges against Mr Kilo and Mr Al Bunni may have 
represented an attempt to silence and prevent them from carrying out their human rights 
activities, in particular their work advocating for the right to freedom of expression. 
 
<b>Replies from the Government 
</b> 
622. By letter of 8 September 2006, the Government replied to the communication of 21 
February 2006 concerning two university students, Mr <b>Ali Nizar Mustafa</b> and Mr <b>Husam Ali 
Mulhim</b>. The Government noted that they were both arrested due to their participation in 
activities hostile to the State and due to the use of the Internet to incite public unrest.  The 
Government explained that under article 307 of the Criminal Code, any act, writing or 
correspondence aimed at, or resulting in, the creation of confessional or racial strife or 
encouragement of conflict between the confessional groups and different ethnic communities of 
the nation shall be punished by a term of six months up to two years' imprisonment and a fine of 
100 to 200 Syrian pounds, together with deprivation of the rights enumerated in article 65, 
paragraphs 2 and 4. The Government added that both Ali Nizar Mustafa and Husam Ali Mulhim 
had established a cell of an organization that advocates acts of terrorism against society and the 
State and solicited support from abroad, being punishable under article 306, paragraph 10, and 
article 364 of the Criminal Code. Accordingly, they were arraigned before the Higher State 
Security Court, pursuant to arraignment order No. 2/9/100 of 4 April 2006.  At the time this 
reply was sent they were on trial. 
 
623. By letter dated 30 October 2006, the Government replied to the communication dated 2 
June 2006 concerning Mr Michel Kilo, Mr <b>Anwar Al Bunni</b>, Mr Ghaleb Ammar, Mr Mahmoud 
Merri, secretary of  AOHR, Mr Sulieman Al Shamr, Mr Abbas Abbas, Mr Khalil Hussein, Mr 
Mahmoud Issa, former political prisoner, and Mr Nidal Darwish. The Government noted that Mr 
Al Bunni provided offices for the <i>Institute for Assistance and Solidarity</i>, based in Brussels, to 
carry out trainings of civil society; employed a local Syrian team and had furnished the Institute. 
The Government noted that Mr Al Bunni had done this before the organization had received a 
license to operate in Syria in contravention of the regulations and laws in force. Furthermore he 
published information on the Internet making false allegations against Syria damaging its 
standing in the domestic and international arenas, what is punishable under articles 286 and 287 
of the Syrian Criminal Code. Additionally, Mr Al-Bunni signed and encouraged intellectuals to 
sign the Damascus-Beirut Declaration, which contains allegations and assertions made by a 
Lebanese faction that is hostile to Syria. Mr Al-Bunni accepted support from foreign 
governments and entities that are hostile to Syria, what is punished under article 264 of the 
Syrian Criminal Code. The Government explained that a legal case has been brought against Mr 
Al-Bunni for battery and assault of Ms Ghada al-Hamawi.  When this woman was examined by a 
police doctor, she was found to have bruising on the stomach and head and abrasions on the 
stomach and in the pelvic area.  She was prescribed 20 days of treatment and 10 days off work.  
The Government stated that the incident happened after Mr al-Bunni refused to return the money </p>

he had taken from her pursuant to a contract engaging him as her defence counsel.  At the time 
this communication was sent the case was before the courts. 
 
624. By letter dated 25 October 2006, the Government replied to the communication of 4 
October 2006 concerning <b>Mr Mohammed Ghanem. </b>The<b> </b>Mission stated that Mr Ghanem was 
arrested on 31 March 2006 for carrying out activities hostile to the State. These activities 
consisted of calling for the dismemberment of Syria and the establishment of sectarian and 
ethnic statelets. The letter noted that this act is punishable under Syrian law in accordance with 
articles 286 to 307 of the Syrian Criminal Code.<b> </b>Mr Ghanem was brought before the military 
prosecution department in Damascus on 7 April 2006 for an examination of the charges against 
him and not for writing articles condemning human rights violations in Syria. The letter 
concluded by stating that Mr Ghanem&#8217;s civil rights are guaranteed under Syrian law.

<p>626. On 16 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning five 
online publications, <b><i>arianastorm.com, centrasia.org, charogiruz.ru, ferghana.ru, </i></b> and 
<b><i>tajikistantimes.ru</i></b>  which were reportedly blocked, following the reported instruction on 7 
October 2006 from the state information-regulation agency of the Ministry of Communications, 
to search twelve web providers and close websites that allegedly aimed to undermine the 
Government's policies in the field of information. Concern was expressed that this measure 
aimed at restricting access to alternatives sources of information, especially in light of the e 
political elections which were to be held on 6 November 2006.  Furthermore, according to the 
information received, the newspaper <b><i>Adolat </i></b> ceased publication on 5 October 2006, after the 
printing company refused to continue their collaboration, allegedly claiming that it was acting on 
instructions from the Ministry of Culture.

Government on 22 July 2005 and of an urgent appeal sent on 7 September 2005. According to 
information received, Mrs Angkhana Neelaphaijit was reportedly threatened on 21 March 2006, 
by a man believed to be a state officer or acting on behalf of the state (the name is known to the 
Special Representatives and the Special Rapporteurs). The man allegedly came to her home and 
warned her against travelling stating, &#8220;you may get in an accident or find a bomb under your 
car.&#8221; This new threat occurred a day before Mrs Angkhana Neelaphaijit lodged a complaint with 
the Ombudsman of Thailand against four policemen in relation to her husband&#8217;s case and while 
the search for her husband&#8217;s remains continued. It was reported that the person who reportedly 
made the threat had come previously to Ms Angkhana Neelaphaijit&#8217;s residence, on 12 March 
2006 and also in April 2005, when he threatened her against contact with the United Nations and 
media regarding the case of her disappeared husband. Concerns were reiterated that these threats 
represented a means to intimidate Angkhana Neelaphaijit in order to dissuade her from 
continuing to seek truth and justice in the case of her husband. 
 
629. On 11 September 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning Mr 
Surakiart Sathirathai, Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand, who had filed a defamation suit 
against <b>Mr Asda Jayanama</b>, the former Ambassador of Thailand to the United Nations, in 
connection with the opinions expressed during his intervention in an academic seminar held on 
15 February 2006 at the Faculty of Political Science Ramkamhaeng University in Bangkok. 
Allegedly, Mr Asda had pointed out during his presentation that Mr Surakiart had failed as an 
administrator and politician in his former capacity of Foreign Minister, and therefore, he should 
have not been proposed as a United Nations Secretary-General candidate. Reportedly, the 
criminal court had accepted the defamation case brought by Mr Sathirathai in his capacity as a 
public and private person.  
<b> 
Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
 
</b>630. By letter dated 29 June 2006, the Government of Thailand responded to the urgent appeal 
sent on 20 July 2004 concerning Ms <b>Supinya Klangnarong, Mr Thaweesin 
Sathitrattanacheewin, Mr Roj Ngammaen </b>and<b> M.r Kannikar Wiriyakul</b>. The Government 
stated that on 15 March 2006, Thailand&#8217;s Criminal Court of Justice withdrew charges against Ms 
Klangnarong, the Thai General Group Company Ltd, Mr Thaweesin Sathitrattanacheewin, Mr 
Roj Ngammaen and Mr Kannikar Wiriyakul who were facing a libel case filed by Shin Corp. 
The Criminal Court ruled that Shin Corp and its affiliates within the Shin Group were registered 
within the stock markets and as such was considered a public entity and could be subject to 
examination. The Government noted that Shin Corp also withdrew its civil lawsuit which 
requested compensation of 400 million baht.  
 
631. By letter dated 16 February 2006, the Government of Thailand responded to the urgent 
appeal sent on 7 September 2005 concerning <b>Ms Angkhana Neelapaijit.</b> The Government 
stated that when Ms Neelapaijit was interviewed by the Department of Rights and Liberty 
Protection, she indicated that the phone call she received on 18 April 2005 from a member of the 
police in relation to her husband&#8217;s disappearance was not considered threatening; however she 
did feel that it was an infringement on her privacy and personal rights. The investigation also 
revealed that Ms Neelapaijit received phone calls which could be perceived as threatening from 
unknown individuals on a regular basis, and that she had not officially reported them as 
sometimes the callers did not issue directs threats, however she had been in contact with the Ban </p>

Yi Police Station who had assisted her when necessary. The Government indicated that as Ms 
Neelapaijit had not lodged official complaints against the callers, no investigative measures or 
judicial action had been taken. Furthermore it was noted that Ms Neelapaijit would not accept 
financial assistance but rather requested that the Department of Special Investigation, expand its 
investigation in relation to her husband&#8217;s disappearance. The Government concluded that great 
importance is attached to Mr Neelapaijit&#8217;s case and that it is currently being investigated in 
accordance with article 21,1 (3) of the Special Investigations Act 2004. Assistance has also been 
offered to Ms Neelapaijit should she require it. 
 
<b>Observations 
 
</b>632. At the time this report was finalized no reply had been received concerning the 
communication sent in 2006. The Special Rapporteur invites the Governmen to reply to these 
allegations. 
</p>
<p><b>The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia</b> 
 
633. On 20 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal concerning 
<b>Zoran Bozinovski</b>, a journalist known for his work exposing corruption and human rights 
abuses. He was the subject of communications sent on 19 December 2003 and on 4 May 2004. 
According to the information received, Mr Zoran Bozinovski was facing numerous 
defamation/insult legal suits, convictions of imprisonment and at least one summons to serve a 
prison sentence, even though on 10 May 2006 the Macedonian Parliament abolished 
imprisonment as a means of punishment of journalists for offences in performing their 
profession. It was reported that, following the changes to legislation, the authorities were 
intending to deliver a Referral Order to Mr Bozinovski to report himself to a Penitentiary 
institution in Skopje to serve the prison sentence. Mr Bozinovski was sentenced by the 
Kumanovo Basic court to three months&#8217; imprisonment on 25 November 2004 because of the use 
of offensive expressions in an article published in the Bulevar weekly of 5 December 2003. The 
article presented the author's view regarding the dependency and link of the Kumanovo 
journalists to the support of business and political &quot;mentors&quot;, and also described some semi-
illegal activities that surrounded the work of the two local broadcasting services. This case was 
one of several dozens of defamation/insult cases pending against Mr Bozinovski, out of which 14 
ended in his convictions: two sentences to imprisonment, two conditional sentences to 
imprisonment and 10 fines. Concern was expressed that the Referral Order may have represented 
a further attempt to prevent and punish Mr Bozinovski from carrying out his legitimate work, in 
particular his activities to expose human rights abuses. 
 
<b>Replies from the Government 
</b> 
634. At the time this report was finalized, the Special Rapporteur had not received any reply to 
the communications sent. The Special Rapporteur therefore invites the Government to respond to 
this allegation.

concernant la situation des d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l&#8217;homme et  le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur

vive pr&#233;occupation en ce qui concerne la situation de <b>Mohammed Abbou</b>, avocat, et sa famille. 
M. Abbou, sa famille et ses avocats ont d&#233;j&#224; fait l&#8217;objet d&#8217;un appel urgent du 9 mars 2005, 
envoy&#233; par la Pr&#233;sidente-Rapporteur du Groupe de Travail sur la d&#233;tention arbitraire, le 
Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur l&#8217;ind&#233;pendance des juges et des avocats, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la

sp&#233;ciale du Secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral concernant la situation des d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l'homme ; d&#8217;un 
appel urgent du 17 mars 2005, envoy&#233; par le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la promotion et la protection 
du droit &#224; la libert&#233; d&#8217;opinion et d&#8217;expression ; et de deux appels urgents du 12 mai et le 16 juin 
2005, envoy&#233;s par le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur l&#8217;ind&#233;pendance des juges et des avocats, le 
Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la promotion et la protection du droit &#224; la libert&#233; d&#8217;opinion et d&#8217;expression 
et la Repr&#233;sentante sp&#233;ciale du Secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral sur la situation des d&#233;fenseurs des droits de 
l'homme.   Selon les all&#233;gations re&#231;ues, M. Abbou, emprisonn&#233; depuis le 1er mars 2005, subirait 
les vexations des gardiens et de certains d&#233;tenus de droit commun, particuli&#232;rement &#224; la suite des 
manifestations en sa faveur, le 2 mars 2006, devant la prison de Kef o&#249; il est incarc&#233;r&#233;. Il aurait 
notamment &#233;t&#233; r&#233;veill&#233; dans la nuit par les gardes qui l&#8217;auraient battu. Pour protester contre ces 
mauvais traitements, M. Abbou aurait entam&#233; une gr&#232;ve de la faim le 11 mars 2006. Depuis lors, 
ses conditions de sant&#233; se seraient consid&#233;rablement aggrav&#233;es, et il n&#8217;aurait pas pu avoir acc&#232;s &#224; 
des soins m&#233;dicaux appropri&#233;s. D&#8217;autres violations ont &#233;galement &#233;t&#233;s signal&#233;es : la m&#232;re de M. 
Abbou aurait pu voir son fils, au cours de la visite hebdomadaire, pendant trois minutes 
seulement avant d&#8217;&#234;tre &#233;loign&#233;e par les gardiens, tandis que sa femme, <b>Samia Abbou</b>, serait 
syst&#233;matiquement suivie par les forces de l&#8217;ordre sur le trajet entre la capitale et la prison de Kef.  
A cause de la pression exerc&#233;es sur elle et son mari, Mme Abbou aurait d&#251; renoncer &#224; voir son 
mari et se contenterait, les jours de visite, d&#8217;un sit-in pacifique dehors l&#8217;&#233;tablissement 
p&#233;nitentiaire. Le 20 mars 2006, Mme Abbou aurait &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233;e par des policiers &#224; l&#8217;a&#233;roport de 
Carthage de retour de Gen&#232;ve, o&#249; elle aurait particip&#233; &#224; des r&#233;unions relatives &#224; l&#8217;appel &#224; la 
lib&#233;ration de son mari.  Les affaires de Mme Abbou auraient fait l&#8217;objet d&#8217;une fouille totale et la 
photo de son mari aurait &#233;t&#233; saisie.  Mme Abbou aurait &#233;t&#233; bloqu&#233;e pendant cinq heures &#224; 
l'a&#233;roport et aurait &#233;t&#233; victime pendant ce temps d'insultes et d&#8217;agressions verbales de la part de 
policiers. Un agent l&#8217;aurait &#233;galement tenue par l'&#233;paule pendant qu'un deuxi&#232;me l&#8217;aurait 
menac&#233;e en lui disant &#171; Je vais te casser la gueule &#187; et en lui indiquant qu'il ne se g&#234;nerait pas 
d'user de tout son pouvoir r&#233;pressif si elle ne se plierait pas &#224; leurs demandes.  Mme Abbou 
aurait enfin &#233;t&#233; lib&#233;r&#233;e suite &#224; l&#8217;intervention d&#8217;un m&#233;decin et d&#8217;amis qui auraient manifest&#233; dans 
la salle des arriv&#233;es de l&#8217;a&#233;roport.  M. Abbou, ancien dirigeant de l&#8217;Association de jeunes </p>

2005.  Il a &#233;t&#233; reconnu coupable d'une agression physique sur l'une de ses cons&#339;urs en 2002 et 
d'avoir diffus&#233; de fausses informations sur Internet.  Ainsi que relev&#233; dans l&#8217;appel urgent adress&#233; 
au Gouvernement le 16 juin 2005, le proc&#232;s d&#8217;appel n&#8217;aurait pas respect&#233; les normes 
internationales relatives &#224; la tenue d&#8217;un proc&#232;s &#233;quitable. La presse, l'&#233;pouse de l&#8217;inculp&#233; et de 
nombreux observateurs nationaux et internationaux auraient &#233;t&#233;s &#233;vacu&#233;s avant le d&#233;but de 
l&#8217;audience et n&#8217;auraient pas &#233;t&#233; en mesure d&#8217;assister aux d&#233;bats.  Seuls les avocats de la d&#233;fense 
et ceux mandat&#233;s par les organisations non gouvernementales internationales auraient &#233;t&#233; 
pr&#233;sents, mais ils n&#8217;auraient pas pu prendre la parole pour assurer la d&#233;fense de Mohammed 
Abbou. Aucune preuve tangible n&#8217;aurait appuy&#233; l&#8217;accusation d&#8217;agression physique &#224; l'une de ses 
cons&#339;urs.  Dans sa r&#233;ponse du 5 septembre 2005 &#224; l&#8217;appel urgent du 16 juin 2005, le 
Gouvernement indique que M. Abbou aurait b&#233;n&#233;fici&#233; de toutes les garanties l&#233;gales, dont 
notamment le droit de s&#8217;entretenir r&#233;guli&#232;rement avec ses avocats. Toutefois, en d&#233;pit des 
informations fournies, les Rapporteurs et la Repr&#233;sentante sp&#233;ciale restent  inquiets par rapport 
au respect de normes internationales relatives au proc&#232;s &#233;quitable dans le proc&#232;s de M. Abbou, 
notamment en l&#8217;absence de r&#233;ponse du Gouvernement sur les all&#233;gations selon lesquelles la 
presse, l'&#233;pouse de l&#8217;inculp&#233; et de nombreux observateurs nationaux et internationaux n&#8217;auraient 
pas &#233;t&#233; autoris&#233;s &#224; assister aux d&#233;bats.  Les Rapporteurs et la Repr&#233;sentante sp&#233;ciale ont aussi 
soulign&#233; leur crainte que la condamnation de M. Abbou soit surtout li&#233;e &#224; l&#8217;expression de ses 
opinions &#224; travers la publication sur Internet d&#8217;articles sur des sujets divers comme l&#8217;utilisation 
de la torture en Tunisie, les invitation faites &#224; certains chefs d&#8217;&#233;tat &#233;trang&#232;res d'assister au 
Sommet mondial sur la soci&#233;t&#233; de l'information (SMSI) et des r&#233;flexions sur la famille du

leur vive pr&#233;occupation pour l&#8217;int&#233;grit&#233; physique et psychologique de M. Abbou et de sa famille, 
notamment &#224; la lumi&#232;re des violences et harc&#232;lements dont il ferait l&#8217;objet, et ont appel&#233; le 
Gouvernement tunisien &#224; prendre de mani&#232;re urgente toute les mesures n&#233;cessaires pour garantir 
l&#8217;int&#233;grit&#233; physique et psychologique de M. Abbou et de sa famille.  Par ailleurs, ils ont 
&#233;galement appel&#233; le Gouvernement &#224; transmettre leur vives inqui&#233;tudes aux autorit&#233;s

urgent sur la situation de la <b>Ligue tunisienne des droits de l&#8217;homme</b> (LTDH) qui, suite &#224; la

ce qu&#8217;une d&#233;cision soit prise sur le fond.  Cette d&#233;cision en r&#233;f&#233;r&#233; avait d&#233;j&#224; fait l&#8217;objet d&#8217;un

concernant la situation des d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l&#8217;homme ont envoy&#233; une lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation 
sur la situation de <b>Kamel Jendoubi</b>, ancien pr&#233;sident de la F&#233;d&#233;ration des Tunisiens Citoyens 
des Deux Rives, fondateur du Comit&#233; pour le Respect des libert&#233;s et des droits de l&#8217;homme en 
Tunisie, et actuellement pr&#233;sident du R&#233;seau euro-m&#233;diterran&#233;en des droits de l&#8217;homme.  Selon 
les informations re&#231;ues, depuis mars 2000, les autorit&#233;s tunisiennes auraient refus&#233;, &#224; plusieurs 
reprises, de laisser retourner  M. Jendoubi dans son pays d'origine afin de revoir ses proches et 
notamment d&#8217;assister aux obs&#232;ques de son p&#232;re en 2004.  Le motif avanc&#233; serait les poursuites 
judiciaires dont M. Jendoubi ferait l&#8217;objet, pour &#171; diffusion de fausses nouvelles &#187; et &#171; 
diffamation des autorit&#233;s publiques et judiciaires &#187;, et dont il n&#8217;aurait jamais &#233;t&#233; officiellement

M. Hosni, Mme Rejiba, Mme Belhassen, M. Ben Salem, M. Abbou et sa famille. Le 3 d&#233;cembre 
2006, plusieurs personnes, dont N&#233;jib Hosni, Abderraouf Ayadi, Abdelwahab Maatar, Tahar 
Laabidi et Ali Ben Salem, aurait &#233;t&#233; insult&#233;es, menac&#233;es, et parfois m&#234;me malmen&#233;es par les 
forces de l&#8217;ordre devant le domicile de Moncef Marzouki &#224; qui elles souhaitaient rendre visite, &#224; 
Tousse. Ce dernier serait inculp&#233; d&#8217;&#171; incitation &#224; la d&#233;sob&#233;issance civile&#187; pour avoir appel&#233; le 
peuple tunisien, lors d&#8217;une interview diffus&#233;e par la cha&#238;ne <i>Al-Jazera,</i> le 14 octobre 2006, &#224; 
protester pacifiquement contre les restrictions impos&#233;es &#224; leurs droits fondamentaux. M. 
Marzouki serait passible de trois ans de prison. Le groupe de personnes aurait &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; 
soumis &#224; de nombreux contr&#244;les d&#8217;identit&#233; lors de leur trajet entre Tunis et Tousse. Certains de 
ces contr&#244;les auraient dur&#233; plusieurs heures. Enfin, M. Marzouki aurait &#233;t&#233; emp&#234;ch&#233; de rejoindre 
ses amis en partance pour Tunis.   Le 7 d&#233;cembre 2006, Mme Abbou, M. Marzouki, M. 
Boukhdir et Me Ben Amar auraient &#233;t&#233; stopp&#233;s &#224; trois reprises par des barrages routiers tenus par

actuellement emprisonn&#233; M.. Mohammed Abbou. Au troisi&#232;me barrage, une quarantaine de 
policiers les auraient bloqu&#233;s, leur interdisant de reprendre la route que ce soit dans un sens ou 
dans un autre. Leurs papiers auraient &#233;t&#233; confisqu&#233;s. Le groupe de personnes aurait ensuite &#233;t&#233; 
autoris&#233; &#224; continuer sa route, mais ce serait fait agresser tout d'abord &#224; la sortie d'un restaurant o&#249;

<b>R&#233;ponses du Gouvernement 
</b> 
652. Le 19 avril 2006, le Gouvernement a r&#233;pondu &#224; un appel urgent envoy&#233; par le Rapporteur 
sp&#233;cial et la Repr&#233;sentante du Secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral sur les d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l&#8217;homme le 5 
janvier 2006, concernant <b>Sa&#239;da Akrami</b>.  Le Gouvernement pr&#233;cise qu&#8217;aucun document 
appartenant &#224; Saida Akremi ne lui a &#233;t&#233; confisqu&#233;, lors de son retour en Tunisie apr&#232;s un s&#233;jour 
au Sri Lanka.  Mme Akremi a seulement fait l&#8217;objet, comme tout autre passager, d&#8217;un contr&#244;le 
ordinaire de bagages et ce, conform&#233;ment aux r&#232;gles et proc&#233;dures douani&#232;res en vigueur.  Quant 
aux autres all&#233;gations de &#171; surveillance polici&#232;re &#187; et de &#171; suivi des d&#233;placement &#187; dont 
l&#8217;int&#233;ress&#233;e pr&#233;tend de faire l&#8217;objet, celles-ci sont d&#233;nu&#233;es de tout fondement.  Mme Akremi 
s&#8217;adonne normalement &#224; ses activit&#233;s et se d&#233;place librement &#224; l&#8217;int&#233;rieur du pays ainsi que &#224; 
l&#8217;&#233;tranger. S&#8217;agissant de ladite &#171; Association internationale de soutien aux prisonniers 
politiques &#187;, dont Mme Akremi pr&#233;tend &#234;tre secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;rale, il y a lieu d&#8217;indiquer qu&#8217;elle n&#8217;a 
aucune existence juridique en Tunisie, dans la mesure o&#249; aucun dossier de constitution de cette 
association n&#8217;a &#233;t&#233; d&#233;pos&#233; au pr&#232;s des autorit&#233;s comp&#233;tentes selon la proc&#233;dure l&#233;gale en 
vigueur.   
 
653. Le 11 juillet 2006, le Gouvernement a r&#233;pondu &#224; un appel urgent envoy&#233; par le Rapporteur 
sp&#233;cial et la Repr&#233;sentante du Secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral concernant la situation des d&#233;fenseurs des droits 
de l&#8217;homme le 20 avril 2006, concernant la demande de duplicata de passeport formul&#233;e par 
<b>Souhayr Belhassen</b>. Le Gouvernement informe qu&#8217;apr&#232;s le temps n&#233;cessaire pour 
l&#8217;accomplissement de la proc&#233;dure d&#8217;usage, une suite favorable a &#233;t&#233; r&#233;serv&#233;e &#224; la demande en 
question.  Un nouveau passeport a &#233;t&#233; d&#233;livr&#233; &#224; l&#8217;int&#233;ress&#233;e le 27 avril 2006.  Il y a lieu de 
pr&#233;ciser que toute demande de duplicata de passeport est soumise &#224; une proc&#233;dure pr&#233;vue par la 
r&#233;glementation tunisienne en vigueur. Par ailleurs Mme Belhassen exerce normalement ses 
activit&#233;s et se d&#233;place librement &#224; l&#8217;int&#233;rieur du pays ainsi que &#224; l&#8217;&#233;tranger.   
 
654. Le 11 juillet 2006, le Gouvernement a r&#233;pondu &#224; un appel urgent envoy&#233; par le Rapporteur 
sp&#233;cial et la Repr&#233;sentante du Secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral concernant la situation des d&#233;fenseurs des droits 
de l&#8217;homme le 24 mai 2006, concernant <b>Yves Steiner</b>.  Le Gouvernement informe que M. 
Steiner a viol&#233;, par son comportement outrageant et ind&#233;cent, les lois du pays et atteinte &#224; sa 
souverainet&#233;, pendant qu&#8217;il assistait au congr&#232;s de la section d&#8217;Amnesty International si&#233;geant &#224; 
Tunis. Depuis son arriv&#233;e en Tunisie, M. Steiner s&#8217;est obstin&#233; dans ses comportements 
provocateurs, usant en public de termes ind&#233;cents et inacceptables qui portent atteinte &#224; la 
souverainet&#233; du pays et &#224; la cr&#233;dibilit&#233; de ses institutions.  Les agissements de M. Steiner sont 
intol&#233;rables d&#8217;autant plus que ces agissements ne sont pas compatibles avec l&#8217;accord de si&#232;ge 
entra&#238;nant l&#8217;obligation pour les membres et les structures de l&#8217;organisation concern&#233;e de 
s&#8217;abstenir de s&#8217;impliquer dans les questions concernant le pays qui abrite leur section. De ce fait, 
et en conformit&#233; avec la r&#233;glementation en vigueur, M. Steiner a &#233;t&#233; pri&#233;, le 21 mai 2006, de 
quitter le territoire tunisien. 
 
655. Le 24 juillet 2006, le Gouvernement a r&#233;pondu &#224; la lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation envoy&#233;e par le 
Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, la Repr&#233;sentante sp&#233;ciale du Secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral concernant la situation des 
d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l&#8217;homme et le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur l&#8217;ind&#233;pendance des juges et des 
avocats, le 3 avril 2006.  Le Gouvernement affirme que M. <b>Abbou</b> s&#8217;est rendu coupable de voies 
de fait sur la personne d&#8217;une de ses cons&#339;urs et de diffamation des autorit&#233;s judiciaires 
tunisiennes qu&#8217;il est cens&#233;, sous serment d&#233;ontologique, respecter en toute circonstance.  Tout le </p>

long de son proc&#232;s, M. Abbou a b&#233;n&#233;ficie de toutes les garanties d&#8217;un proc&#232;s &#233;quitable. Il a &#233;t&#233; 
d&#233;fendu par plusieurs avocates et il a us&#233; de son droit &#224; interjeter appel et &#224; se pourvoir en 
cassation. Depuis son incarc&#233;ration en vertu d&#8217;un jugement d&#233;finitif et ex&#233;cutif, M. Abbou 
b&#233;n&#233;ficie, &#224; l&#8217;instar de tous les autres d&#233;tenus, de toutes les garanties d&#8217;un traitement humain et 
conforme &#224; la l&#233;gislation en vigueur, dont notamment les droits &#224; &#234;tre soumis &#224; un examen 
m&#233;dical, &#224; s&#8217;entretenir avec ses avocats et &#224; recevoir les visites de ses proches. S&#8217;agissant de 
l&#8217;acc&#232;s aux soins m&#233;dicaux, M. Abbou a eu droit, d&#232;s son d&#233;p&#244;t dans l&#8217;institution p&#233;nitentiaire, &#224; 
un examen m&#233;dical g&#233;n&#233;ral et a b&#233;n&#233;ficie de visites et de soins m&#233;dicaux chaque fois que cela 
s&#8217;est av&#233;r&#233; n&#233;cessaire. Son &#233;tat de sant&#233; est tout &#224; fait normal et ne pr&#233;sente aucun danger pour sa 
vie ou son int&#233;grit&#233; physique. Pour ce qui est du droit de visite, il a re&#231;u plus de 60 visites de la 
part de son &#233;pouse, de ses enfants, de sa m&#232;re et son oncle. Il a m&#234;me &#233;t&#233; autoris&#233; &#224; recevoir ses 
enfants &#224; plusieurs reprises sans aucun obstacle. Une quinzaine de ses avocats lui ont 
&#233;galement rendu visite &#224; 20 reprises.  Le juge d'application des peines l'a &#233;galement visit&#233; les 3 
janvier 2006 et 8 mai 2006 ainsi que la d&#233;l&#233;gation du Comit&#233; international de la Croix-Rouge 
(CICR) qui l'a rencontr&#233; lors d'une visite &#224; la prison civile du Kef le 14 f&#233;vrier 2006.  Il 
importe de relever le caract&#232;re invraisemblable de la plainte selon laquelle M. Abbou &#171; subirait 
les vexations des gardiens et de certains d&#233;tenus. &#187;. Ce, d'autant plus qu'il est notoirement 
connu que les prisonniers sont solidaires entre eux et qu'ils ne peuvent ex&#233;cuter des 
instructions venant de Administration.  Sa qualit&#233; d'avocat ne peut aucunement lui conf&#233;rer un 
traitement de faveur qui serait incompatible avec les dispositions de la loi n&#176; 52-2401 en date 
du 14 ma i  2001 portant organisation des prisons, qui interdit tour discrimination entre les 
personnes priv&#233;es provisoirement de leur libert&#233;.  La Tunisie a adopt&#233; les normes 
internationales, harmonis&#233; sa l&#233;gislation interne avec les instruments de protection des droits de 
l&#8217;Homme et modernis&#233; son appareil judiciaire. Depuis le 4 novembre 1988, la Tunisie s&#8217;est dot&#233;e 
d'un d&#233;cret portant organisation des prisons et n'a cess&#233; d'&#339;uvrer pour l'am&#233;lioration des 
conditions de d&#233; t e n t i on  en prenant diverses mesures organiques et fonctionnelles dont on 
peut citer particuli&#232;rement:  
</p>
<p>a) Adoption de la d&#233;finition de la torture telle que formul&#233;e dans la Convention 
pertinente des Nations Unies et ce, en vertu de la loi n&#176; 89 du 2 ao&#251;t 1999 portant amendement 
du Cod&#233; p&#233;nal. Cette loi, a &#233;galement interdit le travail obligatoire au sein deus institutions 
p&#233;nitentiaires et a institu&#233; une peine alternative &#224; la peine de travail pour l'int&#233;r&#234;t g&#233;n&#233;ral.  
</p>
<p>b) Institution du syst&#232;me du double degr&#233; de juridiction en mati&#232;re criminelle en vertu 
de la loi du 17 avril 2000 portant amendement du Code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale.  
</p>
<p>c) Cr&#233;ation de la fonction du jug&#233; d`application des peines vertu de la loi du 31 juillet 
2000 portant amendement du Code de Proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale telle que modifi&#233; par la loi du 29 
octobre 2002.  
</p>
<p>d)  Transfert de la tutelle sur l'administration p&#233;nitentiaire du Minist&#232;re de l'int&#233;rieur au 
Minist&#232;re de la justice et des droits de l&#8217;Homme et ce, en application de la loi du 3 mai 2001.  
</p>
<p>e)  Promulgation d'une loi portant organisation des prisons en date du 14 mai 2001 en 
remplacement du d&#233;cret du 4 novembre 1988.  </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 243 
 
</p>
<p>f) Insertion dans l&#8217;article 13 de la Constitution de la R&#233;publique Tunisienne de 
l'obligation de traiter les personnes priv&#233;es de libert&#233; dans le plein respect de leur dignit&#233; et 
int&#233;grit&#233; physique.  
</p>
<p>g) Institution du droit &#224; r&#233;paration pour toutes les personnes ind&#251;ment arr&#234;t&#233;es et ce, 
en vertu de la loi du 29 octobre 2002 relative aux d&#233;dommagements des personnes arr&#234;t&#233;es 
ou d&#233;tenues et dont l'innocence e &#233;t&#233; ult&#233;rieurement prouv&#233;e.  
</p>
<p>h) En plus de visites inopin&#233;es du Comit&#233; sup&#233;rieur des droits de l&#8217;Homme et des 
libert&#233;s fondamentales, les autorit&#233;s Tunisiennes ont conclu, en avril 2005, un accord avec 
le CICR autorisant celui-ci &#224; visiter tous les lieux de garde &#224; vue et d&#8217;incarc&#233;ration, 
observer le traitement r&#233;serv&#233; aux personnes priv&#233;es provisoirement de leur libert&#233; et 
entendre celles qu&#8217;il choisit librement en dehors de tout control de l&#8217;administration. La 
mission du CICR se poursuit encore.  
</p>
<p>656. Le 3 octobre 2006, le Gouvernement a r&#233;pondu &#224; deux appels urgents envoy&#233; le 19 juin et 
le 11 juillet 2006, par le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial et la Repr&#233;sentante du Secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral sur les 
d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l&#8217;homme sur la situation d&#8217;<b>Ali Ben Salem</b>.  Le Gouvernement informe 
qu&#8217;une plainte pour diffamation a &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;sent&#233;e par le directeur de la prison civile de Bourj-
Erroumi (Bizerte) au Procureur de la R&#233;publique aupr&#232;s du Tribunal de premi&#232;re instance de 
Bizerte, suite &#224; la diffusion d&#8217;un communiqu&#233; publi&#233; sur la signature d&#8217;Ali Ben Salem et 
all&#233;guant de &#171; mauvais traitement de d&#233;tenus &#187; et &#171; d&#8217;atteinte &#224; la saintet&#233; du Saint Coran &#187;. Le 
Parquet de Bizerte a ordonn&#233; l&#8217;ouverture d&#8217;une instruction judiciaire sur ces all&#233;gations afin 
d&#8217;apporter les &#233;claircissements n&#233;cessaires et de d&#233;limiter les responsabilit&#233;s &#233;ventuelles &#224; ce 
sujet.  Dans le cadre de l&#8217;instruction judiciaire au cours de la quelle ont &#233;t&#233; entendus des diverses 
parties concern&#233;es, il a &#233;t&#233; d&#233;cid&#233; du maintien du garde &#224; vue d&#8217;Ali Ben Salem, puis de sa mise 
en libert&#233; provisoire, vraisemblablement en raison de son &#226;ge avanc&#233;e et de son &#233;tat de sant&#233; 
pr&#233;caire. L&#8217;instruction suit son cours.   
 
657. Le 5 octobre 2006, le Gouvernement a r&#233;pondu &#224; une lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation envoy&#233; par le 
Rapporteur sp&#233;cial en date 27 janvier 2006, concernant les hebdomadaires <i>Al Maoukif</i>, publi&#233; par 
le parti d&#233;mocratique progressiste, et <i>Akhbar Al Joumhouria</i>. Le Gouvernement informe que les 
deux hebdomadaires en question n&#8217;ont pas fait l&#8217;objet d&#8217;aucune mesure de saisie.  Ils sont 
publi&#233;s et distribu&#233;s r&#233;guli&#232;rement et sans aucune entrave sur le territoire national. Aucune 
plainte &#224; ce sujet n&#8217;a &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;sent&#233;e  aux autorit&#233;s comp&#233;tentes.  En Tunisie, la libert&#233; de 
publication est strictement organis&#233;e par la loi. Aucun journal ne peut &#234;tre suspendu sans une 
d&#233;cision de justice.  D&#8217;ailleurs de puis le 7 novembre 1987, pas un seul journal ou magazine n&#8217;a 
fait objet d&#8217;une d&#233;cision de suspension.  L&#8217;&#201;tat consacre d&#8217;importantes ressources pour aider 
mat&#233;riellement la parution de la presse des parties politiques afin qu&#8217;elle contribue &#224; 
l&#8217;enrichissement et &#224; la diversification du paysage m&#233;diatique. Un texte de loi a &#233;t&#233; r&#233;cemment 
adopt&#233; portant sur la majoration de la subvention annuelle accord&#233;e &#224; la presse des partis

658. Le 5 octobre 2006, le Gouvernement a r&#233;pondu &#224; une lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation envoy&#233;e par le 
Rapporteur sp&#233;cial en date 2 mars 2006, concernant un rassemblement devant le si&#232;ge du Forum 
d&#233;mocratique pour le travail et les libert&#233;s (FDTL). Le Gouvernement indique que le FDTL, 
formation politique l&#233;gale, exerce ses activit&#233;s en toute libert&#233; et sans aucune entrave. S&#8217;agissant 
du rassemblement du 24 f&#233;vrier 2006, celui-ci &#233;tait ill&#233;gal et instigu&#233; par des formations n&#8217;ayant </p>

aucun statut juridique.  L&#8217;intervention des autorit&#233;s pour emp&#234;cher le d&#233;roulement dudit 
rassemblement a eu lieu sans incident.  Quant aux pr&#233;tendues agressions de manifestants et 
d&#233;tention de certains d&#8217;entre eux, elles sont d&#233;nu&#233;es de tout fondement. D&#8217;ailleurs, aucune 
plainte n&#8217;a &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;sent&#233;e aux autorit&#233;s judiciaires comp&#233;tentes &#224; ce sujet.  En Tunisie, toutes 
formations politiques l&#233;galement constitu&#233;es vaquent sans entrave &#224; leurs activit&#233;s dans le cadre 
de l&#8217;Etat de droit et du respect de la loi. Pour ce qui est de la libert&#233; de r&#233;union, elle est garantie 
par la Constitution (article 8) et est exerc&#233;e dans les conditions d&#233;finies par la loi n&#176; 69-4 du 24 
janvier 1969 relative &#224; la r&#233;glementation des r&#233;unions publiques, cort&#232;ges, d&#233;fil&#233;s, manifestations 
et attroupement.   
 
659. Le 5 octobre 2006, le Gouvernement a r&#233;pondu &#224; une lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation envoy&#233; par le 
Rapporteur sp&#233;cial conjointement avec la Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale sur la violence contre les femmes 
et la Repr&#233;sentante du Secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral sur les d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l&#8217;homme,  en date 31 
janvier 2006, concernant l&#8217;Association tunisienne des femmes d&#233;mocrates (ATFD) et le Collectif 
du 18 octobre pour les droits et les libert&#233;s. Le Gouvernement affirme que l&#8217;ATDF exerce ses 
activit&#233;s, comme toute autre information l&#233;gale, en toute libert&#233; et sans aucune entrave dans le 
cadre de l&#8217;&#201;tat de droit et du respect de la loi. Quand au soi-disant &#171; Collectif du 18 octobre pour 
les droits et les libert&#233;s &#187;, cette formation n&#8217;a aucun statut juridique en Tunisie, ses membres 
(parmi lesquels les personnes cit&#233;es dans la communication, <b>Ayachi Hammami</b>, <b>Hamma 
Hammami</b> et <b>Lofty Hajji</b>) ont choisi d&#8217;agir en marge de la l&#233;galit&#233; cherchant des actions 
spectaculaires &#224; usage de communication douteuse en vue de provoquer agitation et d&#233;sordre.   
 
660. Le 5 octobre 2006, le Gouvernement a r&#233;pondu &#224; les lettres d&#8217;all&#233;gation, envoy&#233;es par la 
Repr&#233;sentante sp&#233;ciale sur la situation des d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l'homme et les 
Rapporteurs sp&#233;ciaux sur la promotion et la protection du droit &#224; la libert&#233; d'opinion et 
d'expression, et sur la torture, le 20 avril et le 31 mai 2006, faisant &#233;tat d'all&#233;gations 
concernant la Ligue t u n i s i e n n e  d e s  d r o i t s  d e  l ' h o m m e  (LTDH).  &#192; la demande de 
sept pr&#233;sidents de sections locales de la LTDH (contestant les mesures de fusion-dissolutions 
de sections prises par le comit&#233; directeur de la ligue, en violation des statuts de l'association), 
un premier jugement en r&#233;f&#233;r&#233;, &#224; &#233;t&#233; rendu le 5 septembre 2005, par le tribunal de premi&#232;re 
instance de Tunis d&#233;cidant la suspension du congr&#232;s de la LTDH, initialement pr&#233;vu du 9 au 11 
septembre 2005 pour violation par le comit&#233; directeur des statuts et du r&#232;glement int&#233;rieur de 
la Ligue et l'arr&#234;t de tous les actes pr&#233;liminaires ou pr&#233;paratoires de ce congr&#232;s, en attendant de 
r&#233;unir tous les &#233;l&#233;ments n&#233;cessaires pour trancher le litige quant au fond.  En qu&#234;te d'un 
r&#232;glement &#224; l'amiable, les plaignants (&#224; l'exception des pr&#233;sidents des sections de Tunis-
Medina et de Montfleury) ont retir&#233; leur plainte afin de trouver une solution au litige. 
Cependant, le comit&#233; directeur, tournant le dos &#224; cette initiative et faisant fi des statuts de la 
Ligue, de son r&#232;glement int&#233;rieur et des d&#233;cisions de justice a, malgr&#233; tout, d&#233;cid&#233; de tenir le 
congr&#232;s les 27 et 28 mai 2006. Les plaignants, usant de leurs droits l&#233;gitimes, ont alors de 
nouveau saisi la justice qui a d&#233;cid&#233;, le 18 avril 2006, par jugement en r&#233;f&#233;r&#233;, la suspension du 
congr&#232;s de la Ligue et l'arr&#234;t de tous les actes pr&#233;liminaires ou pr&#233;paratoires du congr&#232;s 
projet&#233;, en attendant de trancher le litige quant au fond.  &#192; la demande d'un huissier de justice 
mandat&#233; par les plaignants, le Procureur de la R&#233;publique territorialement comp&#233;tent a 
autoris&#233; l'assistance de la force publique pour l'ex&#233;cution du dit jugement. L'intervention 
autoris&#233;e de la police s'est d&#233;roul&#233;e selon les proc&#233;dures usuelles dans le cadre de la loi.  
Le congr&#232;s n'a finalement pas eu lieu.  II convient de noter enfin que le 3 juin 2006, le </p>

2005 par le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial et la Repr&#233;sentante du Secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral concernant la situation 
des d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l&#8217;homme concernant <b>Christophe Boltanski</b>.  Le Gouvernement 
informe que suite &#224; une plainte d&#233;pos&#233;e par M. Boltanski, une double enqu&#234;te polici&#232;re et 
judiciaire a &#233;t&#233; ouverte et l&#8217;affaire fut enr&#244;l&#233;e sous le n&#176; 2399/4. Dans sa r&#233;ponse le 
Gouvernement souligne que cette affaire de droit commun est du ressort de la justice et qu&#8217;il 
incombe &#224; l&#8217;avocat de M. Boltanski d&#8217;assurer son suivi.  
 
662. Le 20 f&#233;vrier 2006, le Gouvernement a r&#233;pondu &#224; l&#8217;appel urgent envoy&#233; le 19 mai 2005 
par le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial et la Repr&#233;sentante du Secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral concernant la situation des 
d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l&#8217;homme concernant <b>Lofti Hajji</b>. Selon le Gouvernement, M. Hajji, 
ancien du comit&#233; de &#171; l&#8217;Association des journalistes tunisiens &#187; (Association non 
gouvernementale) a us&#233; de sa qualit&#233; &#224; des fins partisanes et pour servir les vis&#233;es personnelles 
de certains &#233;l&#233;ments de l&#8217;association au nombre extr&#234;mement r&#233;duit.  Confront&#233; &#224; l&#8217;opposition de 
la majorit&#233; &#233;crasante des adh&#233;rents, l&#8217;int&#233;ress&#233; a cr&#233;e une autre formation appel&#233;e &#171; Syndicat des 
journalistes Tunisiens &#187; ; formation qui n&#8217;a pas d&#8217;existence l&#233;gale et dont  les objectifs sont 
incompatibles avec la nature de l&#8217;activit&#233; syndicale.  M. Hajji n&#8217;a accompli aucune des 
formalit&#233;s juridiques indispensable &#224; la cr&#233;ation d&#8217;une association selon les textes de loi 
tunisienne. De surcro&#238;t, M. Hajji a diffus&#233; des communiqu&#233;s au nom de la formation ill&#233;gale en 
question. Les autorit&#233;s comp&#233;tentes ont alors attir&#233; son attention, en mai 2005, sur l&#8217;ill&#233;galit&#233; des 
ses actes. Il est &#224; souligner que, contrairement aux all&#233;gations parvenues, l&#8217;int&#233;ress&#233; ne fait 
l&#8217;objet d&#8217;aucune poursuite judiciaire ou de harc&#232;lement. Il exerce sa profession de journaliste de 
fa&#231;on normale. Il a m&#234;me publi&#233;, en 2004, un livre intitul&#233; &#171; Bourguiba et l&#8217;Islam : le leadership 
et l&#8217;imamat &#187;, disponible dans les librairies tunisiennes. La Tunisie a toujours autoris&#233; 
l&#8217;existence des formations et d&#8217;organisations &#224; la condition que leur action soit conforme aux 
dispositions l&#233;gales en vigueur. N&#233;anmoins, toute personne entreprenant une quelconque activit&#233; 
au nom d&#8217;une formation qui n&#8217;a aucune existence juridique  est en infraction avec la loi et est 
passible de poursuites judiciaires.

bureau de la section de la Ligue tunisienne pour les droits de l&#8217;homme (LTDH) &#224; Jendouba, n&#8217;a

de premi&#232;re instance de Jendouba au sujet des faits dont il se pr&#233;tend victime.  En revanche, 
l&#8217;int&#233;ress&#233; avait d&#233;pos&#233;, le 29 septembre 2005, une plainte au nom de son chauffeur, Fethi 
Taboui, indiquant que celui-ci aurait &#233;t&#233; injustement arr&#234;t&#233; par des agents de la s&#251;ret&#233;.  Les 
investigations men&#233;es par le parquet &#224; ce sujet ont r&#233;v&#233;l&#233; que M.Taboui a &#233;t&#233; effectivement

des registres, il s&#8217;est av&#233;r&#233; que l&#8217;affaire en question avait d&#233;j&#224; fait l&#8217;objet d&#8217;une demande 
d&#8217;opposition de la part de M. Taboui et celui-ci fut imm&#233;diatement lib&#233;r&#233;. Le 30 septembre 2005, 
le Procureur de la R&#233;publique, ayant v&#233;rifi&#233; les raisons de l&#8217;arrestation de M. Taboui, a conclu &#224; 
l&#8217;inexistence de l&#8217;infraction de la part des agents de la s&#251;ret&#233; lors de l&#8217;interpellation de 
l&#8217;int&#233;ress&#233;, et a d&#233;cid&#233;, sur la base de l&#8217;article 30 du Code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale, de classer la 
plainte sans suite. Il ressort de ce qui pr&#233;c&#232;de qu&#8217;il s&#8217;agit de faits ordinaires qui ne sont 
aucunement en rapport avec l&#8217;exercice de la profession d&#8217;avocat ni avec la qualit&#233; de membre 
d&#8217;un bureau de la section de la LTDH et de M. Menai.   
 
664.  Le 19 avril 2006, le Gouvernement a envoy&#233; une r&#233;ponse &#224; la lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation du 
Rapporteur sp&#233;cial et de la Repr&#233;sentante du Secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral concernant la situation des

parall&#232;le au Sommet mondial pour la soci&#233;t&#233; de l&#8217;information (SMSI), qui s&#8217;est tenu &#224; Tunis les 
16, 17 et 18 novembre 2005.  Le Gouvernement informe que l&#8217;autorisation des activit&#233;s 
parall&#232;les au SMSI &#233;tait du ressort de l&#8217;Union internationale des t&#233;l&#233;communications et non des 
autorit&#233;s tunisiennes. S&#8217;agissant de la pr&#233;tendue &#171; r&#233;union parall&#232;le au SMSI &#171; du 14 novembre 
2005, le Gouvernement indique qu&#8217;un groupe de personnes guid&#233;es par <b>Radhia Nasaroui</b> se 
sont rassembl&#233;es devant l&#8217;Institut culturel allemand &#224; Tunis. Certaines personnes &#233;trang&#232;res se 
sont jointes.  Elles ont g&#233;n&#233;r&#233; par cette attitude la curiosit&#233; des passants, constituant ainsi un 
v&#233;ritable attroupement sur la voie publique qui a perturb&#233; la circulation. Les agents de circulation 
ont d&#251; alors intervenir pour r&#233;tablir la libert&#233; de passage et disperser la foule.  
 
665. Le 5 octobre 2006, le Gouvernement a r&#233;pondu &#224; un appel urgent envoy&#233; par le

Gouvernement informe que M. M&#233;nard a &#233;t&#233; emp&#234;ch&#233; d&#8217;entrer sur le territoire tunisien, en raison 
de poursuites p&#233;nales engag&#233;es &#224; son encontre en Tunisie, pour des d&#233;lits de droit commun, &#224; 
savoir l&#8217;intrusion violente dans un bureau de l&#8217;Office tunisien du Tourisme &#224; Paris en 2001, le 
saccage des lieux et l&#8217;agression d&#8217;une employ&#233;e. Il s&#8217;agit d&#8217;une affaire d&#233;lictuelle o&#249; M. M&#233;nard 
a sciemment port&#233; pr&#233;judice &#224; des personnes et des biens tunisiens.  L&#8217;instruction judiciaire de 
cette affaire &#233;tant encore ouverte en Tunisie, M. M&#233;nard ne peut acc&#233;der au territoire tunisien 
que pour r&#233;pondre &#224; une convocation du juge instructeur en charge de l&#8217;affaire.  
 
666. Le 5 octobre 2006, le Gouvernement a r&#233;pondu &#224; un appel urgent envoy&#233; par le 
Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la question de la torture et la Repr&#233;sentante 
sp&#233;ciale du Secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral concernant la situation des d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l&#8217;homme, en 
date 11 novembre 2005.  Le Gouvernement informe que des personnes appartenant au soi-disant 
&#171; Comit&#233; national pour le soutien des gr&#233;vistes de la faim &#187; se sont rassembl&#233;s le 8 novembre 
2005 devant la maison de la culture &#171; Ibn Khaldoun &#187; &#224; Tunis, voulant y p&#233;n&#233;trer pour tenir une 
r&#233;union qu&#8217;elles n&#8217;ont pas d&#233;clar&#233;e au pr&#233;alable &#224; l&#8217;administration de l&#8217;institution, alors qu&#8217;il est 
d&#8217;usage dans ce cas faire une r&#233;servation.  Bien qu&#8217;elles aient &#233;t&#233; avis&#233;es de l&#8217;existence de 
travaux de restauration, qu&#8217;on pu constater de visu, elles ont persist&#233; &#224; s&#8217;y introduire de force et &#224; 
semer le d&#233;sordre sur la voie publique.  Alert&#233;s par l&#8217;administration de la dite institution, les 
agents de la police ont d&#251; alors intervenir pour maintenir l&#8217;ordre et r&#233;tablir la libert&#233; de passage. 
Certaines personnes (<b>Mokhtar Trifi</b>, <b>Mohamed Jmour</b>, <b>Khemaies Chammari</b>, <b>Mounir 
Fallah</b>, <b>Chawki Laarif</b> et <b>Salah Belhouichet</b>) ont pu p&#233;n&#233;trer &#224; l&#8217;int&#233;rieur de la maison de la

persuader de quitter les lieux. Le Gouvernement souligne qu&#8217;aucune plainte n&#8217;a &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;sent&#233;e 
faisant &#233;tat d&#8217;actes de violence perp&#233;tr&#233;s par des agents de police &#224; l&#8217;encontre des personnes en 
question.  
 
667. Le 4 d&#233;cembre 2006, le Gouvernement &#224; r&#233;pondu &#224; un appel urgent envoy&#233; par la 
Repr&#233;sentante sp&#233;ciale sur la situation des d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l'homme et les 
Rapporteurs sp&#233;ciaux sur la promotion et la protection du droit &#224; la libert&#233; d'opinion et 
d'expression, et sur la torture, en date 19 octobre 2005.  Le 19 septembre 2005, <b>Mohamed 
Ataya</b> a pr&#233;tendu avoir &#233;t&#233; repouss&#233; par un agent de l'ordre devant le si&#232;ge de la section de 
la Ligue tunisienne des droits de l'homme (LTDH) de Mahdia. Les &#233;l&#233;ments d'information 
recueillis &#224; ce sujet attestent que M. Ataya a demand&#233; au tr&#233;sorier de la section, Mohamed 
Sioud, de le transf&#233;rer &#224; l'h&#244;pital universitaire de la r&#233;gion o&#249; il a subi des examens 
m&#233;dicaux qui ont confirm&#233; que son &#233;tat de sant&#233; &#233;tait normal et qu'il ne pr&#233;sentait aucun 
signe de violence apparent ou pr&#233;sum&#233;.  Le 2 octobre 2005, certains membres de la Ligue 
ainsi que d'autres personnes ont tent&#233; de tenir une r&#233;union au si&#232;ge du &#171; Mouvement 
Attajdid &#187; &#224; Kairouan. Avis&#233;s du caract&#232;re ill&#233;gal de cette r&#233;union, ils ont exprim&#233; leur 
refus avant d'accepter de quitter les lieux sans provoquer d'incidents, &#224; l'exception de M. 
<b>Messoud Romdhani</b> (Pr&#233;sident de la section de la LTDH &#224; Kairouan, gouvernorat d'o&#249; 
l'actuel pr&#233;sident de la LTDH est originaire) qui a pr&#233;tendu avoir &#233;t&#233; agress&#233; par des agents 
de police. M. Messoud Romdhani s'est rendu au poste de police de la ville pour d&#233;poser 
une plainte, o&#249; il lui a &#233;t&#233; demand&#233;, comme l'exige la proc&#233;dure, de pr&#233;senter un certificat 
m&#233;dical attestant le pr&#233;judice corporel pr&#233;tendu, chose qu'il n'a pas effectu&#233; jusqu'&#224; ce jour.  
S'agissant du cas de Zakia Dhifaoui (membre du groupe de Kairouan de la section tunisienne 
d'Amnesty international), il y a lieu d'indiquer que bien qu'elle ait refus&#233; au d&#233;part de quitter 
le si&#232;ge du &#171; Mouvement Attajdid &#187;, elle a fini par accepter de se conformer &#224; la demande 
des agents de l'ordre. D'ailleurs, elle n'a d&#233;pos&#233; aucune plainte et n'a &#233;t&#233; ni interpell&#233;e, ni 
auditionn&#233;e.  Quant &#224; <b>Mokhtar Trifi</b> (Pr&#233;sident de la LTDH), il est &#224; pr&#233;ciser qu'il est libre 
des ses mouvements et qu'il n'a jamais &#233;t&#233; emp&#234;ch&#233; de rejoindre les sections de la ligue.  Les 
membres des sections de la Ligue &#224; Kairouan, Nefta et Mateur se sont attroup&#233;s sur la voie 
publique, ce qui a n&#233;cessit&#233; l'intervention des agents de l'ordre. Plusieurs d'entre eux ont fini 
par lib&#233;rer la voie publique sans incident.  Pour ce qui est de <b>Abdellatff Bouhjila</b>, il y a lieu 
d'indiquer qu'il a &#233;t&#233; condamn&#233; &#224; une peine de 11 ans d'emprisonnement pour appartenance &#224; 
une bande de malfaiteurs ayant pour but de porter atteinte aux personnes et aux biens, ainsi 
que pour tenue de r&#233;unions clandestines.  Contrairement aux all&#233;gations parvenues, M. 
Bouhjila b&#233;n&#233;ficie, depuis son incarc&#233;ration le 24 septembre 1998, d'un suivi m&#233;dical 
appropri&#233;. II a subi une op&#233;ration chirurgicale r&#233;ussie pour l'excision d'ad&#233;nome scl&#233;ros&#233; et

<b>Observations 
 
</b>668. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, en remerciant le Gouvernement pour avoir r&#233;pondu &#224; ses 
communications, l&#8217;invite &#224; r&#233;pondre aux communications du 12 mai, 26 juillet, 3 octobre, 24 
novembre, 22 et 27 d&#233;cembre 2006.  Le Rapporteur tient &#224; exprimer sa pr&#233;occupation au sujet de

situation.

<p><b>Turkey 
 
</b>669. On 14 February 2006, the Special Rapporteur jointly with the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal 
concerning <b>Murat Belge</b>, <b>Haluk Sahin</b>, <b>Erol Katircioglu</b> and <b>Ismet Berkan</b> of the daily 
<i>Radikal </i>and <b>Hasan Cemal</b> of the daily <i>Milliyet</i>. According to the information received, they 
were charged in December for attempting to influence the outcome of an ongoing case through 
their writing. They are also facing prosecution for publicly denigrating Turkishness and the 
institutions of the Turkish state. Charges are stemming from the articles which criticized a ban 
on a university conference about mass killing of Armenians during World War I. On 7 February 
2006, the judge adjourned the hearing until 11 April  to allow the prosecution time to study 
defence objections. If convicted, they could face prison terms of six months to ten years. An 
urgent appeal was sent on 31 May 2005 concerning certain articles of the Penal Code, under 
which they were charged. 
 
670. On 14 February 2006, the Special Rapporteur jointly with the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal regarding 
<b>Ibrahim Kaboglu</b>, a professor of constitutional law at the university of Marmara (Istanbul) and 
<b>Baskin Oran</b>, a professor of political sciences at the university of Ankara. According to 
information received, on 15 February 2006, Ibrahim Kaboglu and Baskin Oran would appear 
before the magistrate&#8217;s court of Ankara on charges of humiliation of jurisdictional power (article 
301/2 of the new penal code) and incitement of the people to hatred and hostility (article 216/I). 
It was alleged that these charges resulted from a report written by Ibrahim Kaboglu and Baskin 
Oran in their respective capacities as President and Reporter for the Consultative Council of 
Human Rights on the rights of minorities and cultural rights, and which was transmitted to the 
Deputy Prime Minister on 22 October 2004. It was reported that if convicted of the above-
mentioned charges, Ibrahim Kaboglu and Baskin Oran would probably face many years of 
imprisonment. Grave concern was expressed that the charges against Ibrahim Kaboglu and 
Baskin Oran represented an attempt to prevent them from carrying out their legitimate activities 
in defence of human rights. 
 
671. On 5 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the situation of human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal regarding Ms <b>Eren Keskin</b>, a 
lawyer who works with the project &#8220;Legal Aid for Women Raped or Sexually Assaulted by State 
Security Forces&#8221; in Turkey. This project provides legal assistance to victims of sexual violence 
and is funded by the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture. Ms Eren Keskin </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 249 
 
was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Special Representative of the Secretary General 
on the situation of human rights defenders on 22 April 2005. According to the information 
received, on 14 March 2006 Ms Keskin was sentenced to ten months&#8217; imprisonment by the 
Kartal 3rd Court of First Instance. The sentence of ten years&#8217; imprisonment was converted into a 
fine of 6,000 Turkish liras. It was reported that Ms Keskin has refused to pay the fine. The 
sentencing results from charges brought against Msher for  insulting the armed forces. These 
charges were brought against Ms Keskin after she gave a speech at a meeting in Cologne, 
Germany in 2002 about cases of sexual violence against women inmates by the Turkish State 
Security Forces. It was reported that Msshe has appealed this decision to the Court of Appeal. 
Concern was expressed that the above decision was connected with Ms Keskin&#8216;s activities in 
defence of human rights, in particular the rights of women who have been the victims of sexual 
violence. 
 
672. On 16 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning Ms <b>Perihan 
Magden</b>, a novelist and columnist. According to the information received, Ms Magden was 
called before the court to hear charges, brought by the Turkish military, of turning people against 
military service in an article on a conscientious objector. In the article, Ms Magden defended a 
conscientious objector, who is being penalised for refusing to undertake military service, and 
described conscientious objection as a human right. Her trial was initially scheduled on 7 June 
2006, but was adjourned to 27 July 2006 to enable the gathering of further evidence. The 
prosecution was asking for three years' imprisonment. Concern was expressed at the authority's 
resorting to the criminal law and sanction. Concern was hightened at reports indicating that a 
number of other writers, publishers and journalists were accused of various charges: from insult 
to the state, judiciary, military or the memory of Ataturk; to attempting to influence the judiciary.  
 
673. On 22 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture,the  Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal regarding Mr 
<b>Resit Yaray</b>, board member of the Batman branch of the Human Rights Association (HRA); Mr 
<b>Mursel Kayar</b>, a member of the Batman branch of HRA; Mr <b>Ali Oncu</b>, member of the 
Diyarbakir Branch of the HRA and chairperson of TES-IS; Mr <b>Edip Yasar </b>and Mr <b>Mecail Ozel</b>,

HRA member; Mr <b>Erdal Kuzu</b>, lawyer and Secretary-General of the Mardin branch of HRA; 
and Mr <b>H&#252;seyin Cangir</b>, Chairperson of the Mardin branch of HRA. According to the 
information received, on 29 March 2006, Mr Resit Yaray and Mr Mursel Kayar were arrested 
and detained in the Directorate of Security in Batman, as they were trying to observe riots that 
were taking place in Batman village. While in custody, Mr Resit Yaray and Mr Mursel Kayar 
were allegedly beaten by police officers after their arrest. On 2 April 2006, Mr Resit Yaray and 
Mr Mursel Kayar were charged with &#8220;assisting and supporting illegal organizations&#8221; and 
transferred to Batman prison, where they remain. The first hearing of the trial of Mr Resit Yaray 
and Mr Mursel Kayar was scheduled to take place on 30 June 2006 before Diyarbakir 
Aggravated Penalty Court. Furthermore, on 29 March 2006, Mr Necdet Atalay was arrested and 
was detained in Diyarbakir D Type Prison. He has been charged with &#8220;assisting and supporting 
illegal organizations&#8221; and the first hearing of his trial will take place on 13 July 2006. On 30 
March 2006, Mr Mecail Ozel was arrested and detained by police officers in Ofis, Diyarbakir. It </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1

is alleged that he was held incommunicado until 3 April 2006. On 4 April 2006, Mr Mecail Ozel 
was brought before the Diyarbakir Criminal Court charged with &#8220;assistance and support to illegal 
organizations&#8221; and transferred to the Diyarbakir Prison where he was being held at the time this 
communication was sent. It is reported that the first hearing of Mr Mecail Ozel&#8217;s trial will take 
place on 13 July 2006. On 2 April 2006, Mr Erdal Kuzu, and Mr H&#252;seyin Cangir, Chairperson of 
the HRA Mardin branch, were arrested in the city of Kiziltepe they allegedly tried to prevent 
attacks by security forces against civilians. They were seriously beaten during their detention and 
were released several hours later. On 4 April 2006, Mr Ali Oncu and Mr Edip Yasar were 
arrested and detained by the anti-terrorism branch of the security forces. On 5 April 2006, they 
were charged with &#8220;assisting and supporting illegal organizations&#8221; and were transferred to 
Diyarbakir Prison where they remain in detention. Mr Edip Yasar&#8217;s trial was scheduled to begin 
on 13 July 2006. Grave concern was expressed that the above events are connected with the 
activities of the above-named people in defence of human rights, in particular because of their 
efforts to observe and report on human rights violations allegedly committed by the security 
forces during the disturbances in Turkey in March and April 2006. 
 
<b>Replies from the Government 
 
</b>674. By letter dated 5 April 2006, the Government of Turkey replied to the communication of 
14 February 2006 regarding the case of <b>Murat Belge, Haluk Sahin, Erol Katircioglu, Ismet 
Berkan </b>and<b> Hasan Cemal</b>. The Government informed that the Union of Jurists in Istanbul 
lodged a complaint with the Chief Public Prosecution Office of Bagcilar against the individuals 
cited above with regard to their articles concerning an ongoing case. Upon the complaint of the 
Union of Jurists, an indictment was issued on 21 November 2005 by the Chief Public Prosecutor 
of Bagcilar, charging Murat Belge, Haluk Sahin, Erol Katircioglu and Hasan Cemal with 
attempting to influence judiciary under article 288 of the Turkish Penal Code (TPC) and 
denigrating the judicial institutions of the State under article 301/2 of TPC. Whereas, Ismet 
Berkan was indicted on a single charge for violating article 288 of TPC. The Government also 
indicated that according to the indictment, the above-mentioned journalists had not responded to 
the invitation by the Chief Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office of Bagcilar to raise defence objection to 
the allegations of the petitioners. The Chief Public Prosecutor pointed out that the offences 
committed through press require due consideration to be given to the freedom of press, right to 
criticize and impart information which are essential for public awareness and safeguarded under 
the Constitution. In this context, the Government pointed out that the members of the press 
should impart information responsibly and prudently, respect the rights of others and should 
refrain from disseminating misinformation and defamatory or denigrating statements. The Chief 
Public Prosecutor, according to the information provided by the Government, also elaborated on 
the principle of the independence of the judiciary in the context of the aims and purposes of 
article 288 of TPC and held that the impugned articles contained statements beyond the lines of 
criticism which denigrated the judicial system, as well as prejudicial and inappropriate 
statements with regard to an ongoing case. The Government informed that on 7 February 2006, 
the five journalists raised their defence objections when appearing before the Court. The trial 
was suspended until 11 April 2006. The Government of Turkey also stated that the independence 
of the judiciary has been safeguarded under article 138 of the Constitution.

dismissed the charges against<b> Ismet Berkan, Haluk Sahin, Hasan Cemal </b>and<b> Erol Katircioglu</b> 
in June 2006. The case against <b>Murat Belge</b> was separated from the others and examined under 
a separate file by the Court. The Government indicated that the Court had recently dismissed the 
charges against Murat Belge under articles 288 and 301 of TPC in connection with his articles 
entitled &#8220;Massacre of Law&#8221; and acquitted the charges regarding &#8220;A Court Decision.&#8221; Both 
articles had been published in the Radikal newspaper on 24 September 2005 and 15 October 
2005 respectively. In this judgement, the Court held the opinion that the views expressed in the 
article entitled &#8220;A Court Decision&#8221; remained within the boundaries of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression and the freedom of press, which are guaranteed by the Constitution, the 
Press Law N. 5187 as well as article 301/4 of TPC.  
 
676. By letter dated 4 September 2006, the Turkish Government replied to the communication

<b>Yasar</b> and <b>Mr Mecail Ozel</b>, <b>Mr Necdet Atalay</b>, <b>Mr Erdal Kuzu</b>, and <b>Mr H&#252;seyin Cangir</b>. 
The Government stated that Resit Yaray and Mursel Kayar, members of the Batman Branch of 
HDA, participated in riots which took place in the province of Batman from 30 to 31 March 
2006. The letter indicated that Mr Yaray and Mr Kayar were responsible for breaking and 
entering the Turkish Telecom building, and that they were subsequently apprehended with the 
rest of the group. On 2 April 2006, they were officially arrested upon the decision of the Penal 
Court of First Instance, in the province of Batman, pursuant to article 100/3-a-9 of the Criminal 
Procedure Code. Mr Yaray and Mr Kayar were to be tried at the 5th Penal Court of Diyarbakir on 
charges of willfully assisting illegal organizations.  Furthermore, the letter stated that Mr Ozel 
had been involved in marking the doors of private residences of law enforcement authorities in 
order to highlight them and their families as targets in Diyarbakir and for responding violently to 
police intervention. It was noted that Mr Ozel was subsequently detained and that his family was 
officially informed of his detention on the same day as his arrest and he was allowed access to 
his lawyer. On 3 April 2006, Mr Ozel was referred to the 4th Penal Court by the Public 
Prosecutor, where he was to be tried on charges of willfully assisting illegal organizations. At the 
hearings of 17 May 2006 and 15 June 2006, it was decided by the Court that Mr Ozel should 
remain in detention pursuant to article 100/3 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The Government 
stated that an investigation had been initiated by the Chief Public Prosecutor in response to a 
complaint lodged by Mr Ozel alleging that he had been subjected to torture whilst in prison.  
Similarly, an investigation was initiated by the Office of the Chief Public Prosecutor into claims 
that Mr Cangir and Mr Kuzu had been arrested and detained. The Government noted that Mr 
Onc&#252; was detained on 4 April 2006 and officially arrested on 5 April 2006 for his involvement in 
the incidents which took place during the funerals in Diyarbakir. On 13 July 2006, a decision 
was taken by the 6th Penal Court of Diyarbakir to release Mr Onc&#252; and a court hearing was

678. By letter dated 13 March 2006, the Turkish Government replied to the communication of 
14 February 2006 concerning <b>Mr</b> <b>Ibrahim Kaboglu </b>and<b> Mr Baskin Oran</b>. The letter stated that 
the case against the aforementioned individuals was being closely monitored by the Government 
as it had attracted considerable public interest. According to the Office of the Public Prosecutor, 
the case involved two separate charges under article 301 and article 216 of the Penal Code, 
which entered into force on 1 June 2005. It was indicated that at the first hearing held in 
February 2006, the court found that the prosecution was initiated at a time when the repealed 
Turkish Penal Code no.765 was still in force. A decision was taken to seek authorization form 
the Ministry of Justice in order to proceed with the case and the trial was adjourned until 10 
April 2006. The letter highlighted Paragraph 4 of article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code which 
requires the Courts to give due consideration to freedom of speech and expression when 
evaluating any act charged under this article. Pursuant to article 90 of the Constitution, 
international norms take precedence over domestic legislation. The letter also refers to the new 
Turkish Penal Code which formed part of an extensive reform initiative regarding the 
administration of justice.  
 
679. By letter dated 30 May 2006, the Turkish Government replied to the communication of 14 
February 2006 concerning <b>Mr</b> <b>Ibrahim Kaboglu </b>and<b> Mr Baskin Oran. </b>The Government stated 
that at the final hearing of the case against the aforementioned individuals, held at Ankara 28th 
Penal Court of First Instance on 10 May 2006, the Court dismissed the case against Mr Ibrahim 
Kaboglu and Mr Baskin Oran, who had been charged with public denigration of the State&#8217;s 
institutions under Article 301 and inciting hatred under article 216 of the new Turkish Penal 
Code (TPC).  
<b> 
Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b> 
680. By letter dated 20 February 2006, the Government of Turkey replied to the communication 
of 22 June 2005 concerning the case of Mr <b>Mehmet Tarhan</b>. The Government stated that the 
Military Court of the 5th Infantry Training Brigade Command convicted Mehmet Tarhan on the 
two insubordination charges and sentenced him to a total of 4 years imprisonment. This 
judgment was reversed by the Military Court of Appeals on 25 October 2005, on the ground that 
Mr Tarhan had stated in his defence that he was gay. It was decided that a medical examination 
was required in order to find out whether he was eligible for military service. The Military Court 
however decided that such examination would have amounted to discrimination based on sexual 
preference according to the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights and that it 
would be inconsistent with law. Therefore, the Court ruled on the continuation of his 4 years' 
imprisonment.

to respond to the communication dated 16 June 2006.

<p>682. On 15 March 2006 the Special Rapporteur jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture sent an urgent appeal regarding two journalists <b>Dzhumadurdy Ovezov</b> and </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 253 
 
<b>Meretmuhammet Khommadov</b>, both working for Radio Liberty, a United States- funded radio 
network. According to the information received, Dzhumadurdy Ovezov and Meretmuhammet 
Khommadov have been held incommunicado since they were arrested on 7 March by police. The 
reason for their arrest and their whereabouts were not known at the time this communication was 
sent. Concern was expressed that their arrest may have been directly connected to their 
journalistic work for <i>Radio Liberty</i>, which frequently broadcasts programmes criticizing the 
Turkmen authorities. Concern was heightened at reports that staff members of Radio Liberty had 
been harassed prior to the arrest of two above-mentioned journalists, including their telephone 
lines being cut off. Fears were expressed that the above-named persons may have been at risk of 
torture or other forms of ill-treatment. 
 
683. On 29 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal concerning <b>Ogulsapar 
Muradova</b>, correspondent for <i>Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty</i> and former member of 
Turkmenistan Helsinki Foundation (THF), a non-governmental organization working on human 
rights advocacy; her children <b>Sana Muradova</b>, <b>Maral Muradova</b> and <b>Berdy Muradova</b>; <b>Elena 
Ovezova</b> and <b>Annakurban Amanklychev</b>, members of THF; and <b>Sapardurdy Khadzhirv</b>, a 
relative of the director of THF. According to the information received, on 16 June 2006, Mr 
Amanklychev was detained by agents of Ministry of National Security. Reports indicated that he 
was under a strict surveillance for more than a year. Ms Muradova was arrested on 18 June 2006 
by Ashgaba city police officers without arrest warrant. After her arrest, her children were 
repeatedly requested by the National Security Ministry officers to submit Ms Muradova's 
computers, fax and mobile phone. They refused to cooperate with the request. On 19 June, law 
enforcement officials arrested the children: Sana, Maral and Berdy Muradova. Reports indicate 
that Ms Muradova has been subject to various forms of harassment, including surveillance, 
bugging and cutting off of her telephone, and threat.  Moreover, Ms Ovezova was arrested on 18 
June, and Mr Khadzhirv on 19 June both by law enforcement officials in Ashgabat. All of them 
were reportedly being held at the Interior Ministry building in Ashgabad. Prior to the arrests, 
THF publicized information about prison conditions and the imprisonment of a number of people 
allegedly following unfair trials. Concern was expressed at what appeared to be a direct attempt 
to silence people who were or were seen to be affiliated with a group working on human rights 
advocacy. 
 
684. On 24 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders sent 
an urgent appeal regarding <b>Amankurban Amanklychev</b>, <b>Ogulsapar Muradova</b>, and 
<b>Sapardurdy Khajiev</b>, all of them associated with the Turkmenistan Helsinki Foundation (THF), 
a non-governmental organization based in Bulgaria that monitors and reports on human rights 
conditions in Turkmenistan. Ms Muradova is also a journalist for Radio Liberty. They were 
included in a joint urgent appeal sent on 29 June 2006. According to the information received, 
Mr Amanklychkev was arrested on 16 June 2006, Ms Muradova and Mr Khajiev on 18 June 
2006. They have been held incommunicado since. They were charged on 12 July 2006, 
considerably later than the three-day limit prescribed by the Turkmen Code of Criminal 
Procedure requires. Previously Mr Amanklychev had assisted in the production of a 
documentary critical about the human rights situation in Turkmenistan for <i>Galaxie Presse</i>, a </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 254 
 
French television production company that also supplied the camera. Following his arrest, 
various authorities, such as the national security minister and by the Turkmenistan News Service 
made statements accusing Mr Amanklychev of having been involved in subversion and 
espionage. In view of their prolonged incommunicado detention, fears were expressed that Mr 
Amanklychev, Ms Muradova and Mr Khajiev may have been at risk of torture and other forms of 
ill-treatment in custody.  
 
685. On 19 September 2006, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal regarding 
the death in custody of Ms <b>Ogulsapar Muradova</b>, a prominent human rights activist associated 
with the Turkmenistan Helsinki/Foundation (THF) and journalist for Radio Free Europe/Radio 
Liberty, for whom two urgent appeals were already sent to the Government on 29 June and 24 
July 2006. According to the information received, Ms Muradova was arrested in mid-June on 
accusations of &#8220;subversive activities, along with Mr Amankurban Amanklychev and Mr 
Sapardurdy Khajiev, two other human rights defenders both members of THF. Mr Amanklychev 
had been arrested on June 16, 2006 by police officers, when he was working on a documentary 
with two French production companies, dealing with the deterioration of the health and 
education systems in Turkmenistan, and the personality cult of the President of the Republic. Mr 
Khajiev and Ms. Muradova were arrested on June 18, 2006, at their homes. They all remained 
detained incommunicado in a National Security Service pre-trial detention centre for more than 
two months, during which they were reportedly subjected to ill-treatment. Besides, they were 
never notified about the charges against them, nor were their lawyers, and they were not allowed 
to meet them. On June 19, 2006, the highest authorities&#8217; representatives, such as the President of 
the Republic and the National Security Minister, publicly accused the three defendants of having 
conspired with foreigners in order to destabilize the State. According to the information received, 
their trial took place in camera. Indeed, the lawyers were denied access to Court. As a 
consequence, only the Prosecutor and the defendants were allowed to attend the hearing, which 
lasted just a few minutes. Moreover, the Court building and the streets leading to it were 
cordoned off by armed soldiers, preventing the defendants&#8217; relatives and supporters from coming 
in. On August 25, 2006, the Azatlyk District Court of Ashgabat respectively condemned Mrs 
Muradova and Mr Amanklychev to a six-year and seven-year prison terms, while Mr Khajiev 
was sentenced to a seven-year term in a high-security prison. All three were sentenced for 
&#8220;illegally possessing ammunitions&#8221; (article 287-2 of the Criminal Code), on the basis that police 
officers would have found some arms in Mr Amanklychev&#8217;s car. The three defendants decided to 
appeal this verdict on August 29 and 30, 2006. In the morning of 14 September 2006, members 
of the security forces went to the house of Ms Muradova and took her three children, Sana, 
Maral and Berdy Muradova, to the morgue where they were asked to sign a document 
identifying and reclaiming Ms Muradova&#8217;s body.  The siblings requested an examination of the 
body by an independent doctor, which was reportedly denied. According to reports, they went to 
the United States Embassy and returned with an American representative who was permitted to 
accompany them to view their mother&#8217;s body which bore signs of ill treatment, with various 
wounds in the head and the neck. Reports indicate that Ms Muradova&#8217;s children are under

refused to acknowledge their complaint. Concerns are expressed for the security of Ms

cut. </p>

<p><b>Uganda</b> 
 
687. On 7 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur a letter of allegation concerning <b><i>Radio Katwe</i></b>  
website<b>, </b>whose access was allegedly blocked by the Authorities blocked a week before the 
presidential elections of Thursday 23 February 2006. It was reported that the Government-
controlled Uganda Communications Commission instructed Uganda&#8217;s leading 
telecommunications company, MTN, to block the website on the basis that Ugandan law 
empowers the Commission to direct any telecom operator to operate networks in such a manner 
that is appropriate to national and public interest. Concern was expressed that this decision was 
in direct connection with the highly critical reporting by <i>Radio Katwe</i> of the ruling party, and 
could therefore have been an attempt at silencing all criticism in the run- up to the presidential 
elections. Moreover, according to information received, on 24 February 2005, the website and 
radio station of the independent daily newspaper, The Monitor, were blocked in Uganda, 
reportedly to prevent The Monitor Group from publishing early results concerning the 
presidential elections. The website was, however, accessible outside of Uganda. The Monitor 
Group was intending to publish a running vote based on actual results from the different polling 
stations. The Uganda Broadcasting Council, the Electoral Commission, the police and the 
Internal Affairs Ministry, all urged The Monitor to stop compiling independent results. 
 
688. On 13 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning the 
independent radio station <b><i>Choice FM</i></b> . According to information received, on 1 March 2006, 
police accused the radio station of posing a security threat following a programme it aired, which  
featured opposition and ruling party candidates. The opposition candidates reportedly criticised 
local civilian and military authorities for alleged corruption and mistreatment of detainees. 
Following the radio programme, a local court issued a warrant allowing police to carry out a 
search at the stations&#8217; premises, during which they reportedly confiscated audiotapes and disks 
and ordered the station to turn over a copy of its licence, its programming policy guidelines and a 
recording of the broadcast. The radio station could not hand over the broadcast since the 
necessary equipment malfunctioned. No explanation was provided for the search. Moreover, on 
Friday, 3 March 2006, the police arrested Radio FM&#8217;s radio programme manager, <b>Martin Ojara 
Mapenduzi</b>, detained him and released him the next day after paying bail. The authorities 
threatened to prosecute him and other journalists working at the station if the station failed to 
turn over all the documents requested.  
 
689. On 14 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning editor <b>James 
Tumusiime</b> and reporter <b>Semujju Ibrahim Nganda</b>, both working for the independent <i>Weekly 
Observer</i>. According to the information received, the two journalists were summoned to a police 
station in Kampala in December 2005, when they were charged with promoting sectarianism. 
They were released on bail on the same day, after being charged. The charges allegedly stem 
from a report by Mr Nganda published on 1 December 2005, which described that the opposition </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 256 
 
Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) had accused a small group of army generals and the 
President of persecuting the FDC leader Kizza Besigye. Mr Tumusiime and Mr Nganda were 
called to appear before a court on 15 June 2006. If convicted, they would be facing up to five 
years' imprisonment. Concern was expressed at the authority's resorting to the criminal law for a 
media related offence. Concern was heightened at various reports on alleged intimidation by the 
authority against the press and journalists in relation to the trials against Kizza Besigye. A 
communication was sent by the Special Rapporteur on this issue on 5 December 2005.

<p>691. On 8 September 2006, the Special Rapporteur jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal concerning Mr <b>Mohamed al-Mansoori</b>, a lawyer, 
a human rights activist and President of the Independent Jurist&#8217;s Association, and Mr <b>Mohamed&#8217; 
Abdullah al-Roken</b>, a lawyer, a human rights activist and former President of the UAE&#8217;s Jurists 
Association. According to the allegations received, on 17 June 2006, an arrest warrant was 
issued against Mr Mohamed al-Mansoori, based on an accusation of &#8220;insulting the Prosecutor&#8221;. 
It was alleged that the real motive of this order was to silence Mr Mohamed al-Mansoori, after 
he gave several interviews to Arab satellite television in which he criticized the human rights 
situation in the country. Moreover, on 23 August 2006, Mr Mohamed&#8217; Abdullah al-Roken had 
reportedly been arrested by members of the State Security, Amn al-Dawla. The reasons of his 
detention remained unknown. Previously, Mr al-Roken had been arrested and held for one night 
on July 2006, after he gave an interview regarding the recent conflict in Lebanon, to an Arabic 
television channel. It was also alleged that both Mr al-Mansoori and Mr al-Roken had been 
banned for a number of years from giving interviews or writing articles to the media. In addition, 
in September 2005, the authorities of the Emirate of Fujairah allegedly banned a conference on 
civil rights, women&#8217;s rights and democracy, organized by the Jurists&#8217; Association, without giving 
any reasons. Serious concerns were expressed that Mr al-Mansoori and Mr al-Roken may be 
detained on account of their peaceful activities in defence of human rights, and that their 
detention may form part of a campaign of harassment and intimidation against defenders of 
human rights in the United Arab Emirates.

<p>693. On 23 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning <b>Richard 
Mgamba</b>, an investigative journalist of the newspaper <i>The Citizen</i>, who fled his hometown of 
Mwanza because of a mounting hostility against him by local authorities and police, which 
would have organized a public demonstration against him. The journalist had been investigated 
and could allegedly have been deported to Kenya because of his involvement in the making of a 
movie on illegal economic activities carried out in the vicinity of Lake Victoria. The legal basis 
for his deportation reportedly consisted in the fact that the journalist completed his studies in 
Kenya, though he was born in Tanzania and his parents were Tanzanians. Another person that 
appeared in the movie, <b>Raphael Tukiko</b>, a night watchman working at Lake Victoria, allegedly 
received threats and was instructed to report to police. Recently, President Jakaya Kikwete 
would have criticized the contents of the movie saying that it gave a negative impression of 
Tanzania and its citizens, and may jeopardize the fish trade with Western countries.

696. On 4 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, sent an urgent appeal regarding Mr <b>Josh Wolf</b>, a 
freelance journalist. According to the information received, on 1 August 2006, Mr Josh Wolf 
was imprisoned in a federal jail in Dublin, California, following the decision of a San Francisco 
federal judge to arrest him for contempt of court. The journalist allegedly refused to handle to the 
authorities a video footage of demonstrations in San Francisco in June 2005. Josh Wolf was 
denied bail and his lawyer has filed an appeal to ask for his immediate release. Reportedly, 
Wolf's tape documents clashes between demonstrators and San Francisco police during a violent 
protest, on which a grand jury was investigating, against a G8 summit. Mr Wolf could have 
remained in custody for several months should the appeal for his release have been rejected.  
 
697. On 25 September 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning Mr <b>Josh 
Wolf</b>, a freelance journalist, who had been the subject of a previous communication dated 4 
August 2006, due to his imprisonment for refusing to provide to a Grand Jury his unedited video 
footage of a protest in San Francisco against a G8 summit in Scotland. According to the 
information received, on 1 September, Mr Wolf was released on bail, upon his lawyer&#8217;s request. 
On 11 September 2006, a panel formed by three of the court's judges rejected the substance of 
the request made, and upheld the lower court's decision to hold him in contempt. Two days later, </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1

federal prosecutors filed a motion for his bail to be revoked. On 18 September 2006, Mr Wolf 
was sent back to prison following the revocation of his bail by the three above-mentioned judges, 
for refusing to hand over his unedited video footage of a demonstration to a grand jury. 
Reportedly, in July 2005, during the abovementioned protest in San Francisco against a G8 
summit, a clash between protesters and police led to a police car being set on fire. Mr Wolf 
posted his film of the protest on his blog, which was also aired by a cable television station and 
then picked up by local affiliates of the national networks. Allegedly, Mr Wolf had always 
denied having footage of the attack on the police car and refused to name sources or surrender 
unpublished material and notes, on the basis of his rights under the United States Constitution's 
First Amendment and a Californian shield law that allows journalists to refuse.  
 
<b>Replies from the Government 
</b> 
698. By latter dated 13 November 2006, the Government replied to the communication of 4 
August 2006 concerning <b>Josh Wolf</b>. The Government noted that according to press reports, he 
was present at the scene of a violent San Francisco protest during which a police officer suffered 
a fractured skull and protesters attempted to burn his patrol. As a witness to this criminal activity 
he cannot claim immunity from the process for being there as a journalist. Moreover, if Mr Wolf 
possesses video footage of the crime or potential suspects, his status as a journalist does not 
exempt him from having to provide his evidence to authorities. The Government stressed the 
strongest protection of freedom of expression and that it is guaranteed in the Bill of Rights to the 
United States Constitution and is protected by  law to a significantly greater degree than is 
provided for in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. There is no federal 
protection shielding journalists from being required to testify or to produce evidence regarding 
crimes they have witnessed directly, and journalists should be treated the same as any other 
individual who personally and directly witnesses a crime. 
 
<b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
 
</b>699. By letter dated 7 August 2006, the Government of the United States of America replied to 
the communication of 2 September 2005 concerning the case of Mr <b>Abraham Al-Mashadani.</b> 
The Government stated that the Multi-National Force-Iraq (MNF-I) is authorized under United 
Nations Security Council Resolution 1546 to intern individuals &#8220;where necessary for imperative 
reasons of security&#8221; and that Abu Graib, was a detention facility in which MNF-I holds security 
detainees.  Since Mr Al-Mashadani was detained by MNF-I for imperative reasons flowing from 
the conduct of an armed conflict, pursuant to Chapter VII Security Council resolutions, the 
Government of the United States of America  considers that the Working Group and the Special 
Rapporteur do not have competence to deal with this issue. It was further reported that the 
Government disagreed that security internees who are detained in the context of armed conflict 
are entitled to take proceedings before a court, in order that the court may decide on the 
lawfulness of their detentions pursuant to article 9 of ICCPR. In contrast, consistent with the 
Geneva Conventions, a Detaining Power can use an administrative board to review and decide 
challenges to their detention by protected persons. The Government of the United States noted 
that MNF-I released Mr Al-Mashdani in January 2006.

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1

and<b> Mr Gordon Russel</b>. The Government indicated that the United States Constitution 
guarantees the right of freedom of speech and freedom of press and that the United States does 
not censor the media nor are there government reprisals against media outlets or media 
professionals. It was reported that the allegations of police mistreatment in the aftermath of 
Hurricane Katrina have to be considered taking into account the conditions in New Orleans at the 
time of the incident. Hurricane Katrina, a Category Four storm caused the largest evacuation in 
the history of the United States with more than a million people displaced. It was also explained 
that after Hurricane Katrina journalists received daily updates about rescue and response 
operations and were allowed to accompany rescue and response teams when security allowed for 
them to do so. A week after the hurricane, there were an increasing number of media reports 
about the deteriorating security situation in New Orleans. Subsequently martial law was 
implemented. The Government of the United States noted that the allegations of police brutality 
occurred during the period of martial law in areas of the city that government officials had 
warned the public to avoid due to insecurity. According to the information received from the  
Government of the United States, the journalists did not file complaints with the state or federal 
law enforcement authorities and there was no indication that any of these individuals suffered 
any professional repercussions after they went public with their allegations. The Government is 
of the opinion that considering that the range of domestic proceedings have neither been sought 
out nor exhausted, this case does not rise to the level necessary for assistance from outside of the 
domestic context.

</p>
<p>702. On 16 January 2006, the Special Rapporteur jointly, with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding the 
suspension of the activities of the non-governmental human rights organization <b>Freedom House</b>. 
Freedom House is an organization that promotes freedom and democracy around the world and 
has supported human rights defenders in Uzbekistan since 2002. On 13 January 2006 the civil 
court in Tashkent issued a verdict to suspend the activities of Freedom House, following a 
request to this effect from the Uzbek Ministry for Justice on the basis that Freedom House had 
broken Uzbek laws. According to information received, charges brought against Freedom House 
included non-compliance with a secret decree, issued by the Uzbekistan government cabinet, the 
contents of which was reported to be unknown. Violations cited by the Ministry for Justice 
included allowing human rights defenders free access to the internet. Concern was expressed that 
the suspension of the activities of Freedom House based on its alleged non compliance with a 
secret decree, was an attempt to prevent Freedom House from carrying out its legitimate 
activities in defence of human rights in Uzbekistan. Concern was also expressed that the charge 
against Freedom House for providing human rights defenders free access to the internet, was an 
illegal attempt to isolate and prevent human rights defenders from communicating and sharing 
information with others throughout the world.

703. On 18 January 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal with the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding Mr <b>Saidjahon 
Zainabitdinov</b>, Chairman of the Andijan human rights group Apellatsia (&#8220;Appeal&#8221;), an 
organization working on religious and political persecution. Mr Zainabitdinov had already been 
the subject of an urgent appeal sent on 26 May 2005. Mr Zainabitdinov was arrested on 21 May 
2005 by the Uzbek authorities after he had recounted his version of the events in Andijan on 13 
May 2005 to some western media sources. It was reported that on 4 January 2006 the trial of Mr 
Zainabitdinov began in Chirchik, a town near Tashkent where he was reportedly charged with 
defamation and anti-government activities. It was believed that on 12 January Mr Zainabitdinov 
was found guilty and sentenced to 7 years imprisonment in what appears to have been a closed 
trial as information about the proceedings did not become available until after the fact. It was 
further alleged that the trial was held at a secret location and that no official information 
concerning the proceedings was made available to relatives of Mr Zainabitdinov. Concern was 
expressed that Saidjahon Zainabitdinov&#8217;s trial may have been linked to his activities in the 
defence of human rights, in particular his descriptions of the recent events in Andijan and of the 
general human rights situation in Uzbekistan which have appeared in the press. 
 
704. On 6 February 2006, the Special Rapporteur jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the situation of human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal concerning Ms <b>Mutabar 
Tadjibayeva</b>, head of the <i>Ut Yuraklar</i> human rights organization, an unregistered women&#8217;s 
rights organization, member of the Organization for the Defence of Rights and Freedoms of 
Uzbek Journalists, the Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan (HRSU) and the Committee for 
Freedom of Speech and Expression. Ms Tadjibayeva, also a Nobel Peace Prize Laureate (part of 
the initiative &quot;1000 Women for the Nobel Peace Prize&quot;) was the subject of a communication sent 
on 18 July 2005 and on 27 October 2005. According to the information received, on 30 January 
2006, Uzbek authorities prevented people from observing the trial of Ms Tadjibayeva. It was 
reported that a Human Rights Watch representative (whose name is known to the Special 
Rapporteurs and Special Representative), was stopped at a police checkpoint and refused entry to 
Dustobod when he told the police that his purpose for visiting was to observe Ms Tadjibayeva's 
trial.  It was alleged that the police stopped each car entering the town and asked the occupants 
what were their reasons for visiting Dustobod. It was also alleged that an Uzbek human rights 
defender (whose name is known to the Special Rapporteurs and Special Representative), was 
prevented from entering the courthouse where the trial was taking place. Ms Tadjibayeva was 
facing 17 charges, including slander, extortion, swindling, tax evasion, polluting the environment 
and violating rules on trade and land use. Her lawyer was initially denied access to Ms 
Tadjibayeva and when she was able to see her client on 1 February 2006 it was in the presence of 
four guards. In addition, the defence lawyer was given one day to review and prepare the case for 
trial. It is further alleged that during the trial the judge demonstrated preferential treatment by 
granting motions in favour of the prosecution and denying all applications made by the 
defence.Concern was expressed that access to the proceedings had been denied to the public, 
including relatives, friends, colleagues and independent trial monitors which may result in Ms 
Tadjibayeva being denied the right to fair and transparent hearing.  Furthermore concern was 
expressed that the charges against Ms Tadjibayeva were a political attempt to discredit her and 
prevent her from carrying out her human rights activities and may have been linked to her open 
criticism of the events that occurred in Andijan on 13 May 2005.  </p>

705. On 10 March 2006 the Special Rapporteur jointly withs the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegation 
concerning <b>Mutabar Tadjibayeva</b>, head of the Ut Yuraklar human rights organization, an 
unregistered women&#8217;s rights organization, and member of the Organization for the Defence of 
Rights and Freedoms of Uzbek Journalists, the <i>Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan (HRSU</i>) and 
the Committee for Freedom of Speech and Expression. Ms Tadjibayeva was the subject of three 
communications dated 6 February 2006, 18 July 2005 and 27 October 2005. According to new 
information received, on 6 March 2006 Mutabar Tadjibayeva was convicted of slander, extortion 
and misuse of land. She was also found guilty of membership of an illegal organization and has 
been sentenced to eight years imprisonment. It was alleged that Ms Tadjibayeva was denied the 
opportunity to prepare and present an adequate defence and that her lawyer did not have 
adequate time or opportunity to discuss the case with her. Grave concern was expressed that the 
prison sentences inflicted on Mutabar Tadjibayeva is connected to her activities in defence of 
human rights, in particular to her open criticism of the Uzbek authorities in relation to the 
Andijan massacre in May 2005. 
 
706. On 2 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal regarding Mr <b>Ilhom 
Zainabitdinov</b>, a human rights defender and the son of Mr <b>Saidjahon Zainabitdinov</b>, Chairman 
of the <i>Andijan human rights group Apellatsia</i> (&#8220;Appeal&#8221;), an organization working on religious 
and political persecution. Mr Ilhom Zainabitdinov had reportedly provided journalists with 
information concerning human rights violations allegedly committed by the Uzbek authorities in 
relation to the Andijan massacre in 2005. Mr Saidjahon Zainabitdinov was the subject of a letter 
of urgent appeal sent on 26 May 2005. According to the information received, on 22 May 2006 
Mr Ilhom Zainabitdinov did not return to his home. It was reported that on the same day police 
went to his home, showed Mr Zainabitdinov&#8217;s mother an arrest and search warrant and 
conducted a search of the house. On 26 May 2006 it was alleged that the police officers returned 
to his house and conducted another search, during which they confiscated two 50 dollar bills 
which they claim to have been counterfeit. On this occasion it was alleged that the police officers 
informed Mr Zainabitdinov&#8217;s mother that he was being held in a detention centre in Andijan, but 
did not provide information as to why he was being detained. Concern was expressed that the 
alleged detention of Mr Ilhom Zainabitdinov may have been connected with his own activities in 
defence of human rights, in particular because he was suspected of providing information on 
human rights violations to journalists and also because his father is a high profile human rights 
defender.  
 
707. On 25 September 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning the 
situation of <b>Dadakhon Khasanov</b>, who on 8 September 2006 was given a suspended sentence of 
three years imprisonment by the Tashkent City Court for the crime of &#8220;insulting&#8221;, in this case 
Uzbek President Islam Karimov and for &#8220;threatening public security and order.&#8221; Reportedly, the 
verdict was reached behind closed doors and only two witnesses for the prosecution attended the 
final phase of the court hearings. Mr Khasanov was in house arrest, since his detention on 12 
April 2006 by the Uzbekistan's Security Service (SNB). Tapes, disks and books were confiscated 
from his house without any official protocol on the said items. On 31 of July he was charged 
under article 158, 159 paragraph 3 b, and 244-1 paragraph 3 a of the Penal code. On 1 August </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 262 
 
2006 the trial was adjourned until 9 of August 2006 and subsequently till 5 September 2006. It 
was reported that on 10 August 2006, Mr Khasanov met with officials of the Ministry of Interior, 
who allegedly attempted to persuade him to reject the services of his public defender and lawyers 
under the promise of a lighter sentence. On 5 September 2005, the trial resumed and Mr 
Khasanov waived his right to legal representation. The Public Defender gave a statement at the 
court indicating that Mr Khasanov had been pressured to reject his lawyers and public defender. 
 
<b>Replies from the Government 
 
</b>708. By letter dated 19 April 2006, the Government of Uzbekistan replied to the 
communications of 6 February 2006 and 10 March 2006. The Government informed that on 6 
March 2006 <b>Mutabar Tajibaeva</b> was convicted by the criminal court of Tashkent province 
under articles 165, para. 3 (a), 167, para. 3 (a), 168, para. 2 (b), 184, para. 2 (b), 189, para. 3, 
197, 209, para. 1, 28, 209, para. 2 (a), 216, 228, para. 2 (b), 228, para. 3, 229 and 244-1, para. 3 
(b), of the Criminal Code of Uzbekistan, and sentenced under articles 59 and 61 of the Criminal 
Code to eight years deprivation of liberty. He was also stripped of the right to occupy managerial 
and financially responsible posts and to engage in business activity for a period of three years. 
According to the court judgement, M. Tajibaeva used the pretext of defending the rights and 
interests of Akhmadullo Abdullaev and Khafizidin Koraboev during investigation and in court to 
extort from them first 100,000 sum (Uzbek currency), then US$ 900, by means of deceit and 
abuse of their trust, thereby causing particularly extensive losses. The Government informed 
that, with the aim of unlawfully taking possession of half the fish bred by T. Mamadaminov, a 
lessee of the company Andizhonbalik, M. Tajibaeva used threats and coercion to make him 
transfer his rights of ownership into her name, on signature of a contract to that effect. On 6 
October 2005 M. Tajibaeva obtained 350,000 from Mamadaminov by extortion and the next day 
M. Tajibaeva was arrested in flagrante delicto by law-enforcement officers in the act of receiving 
250,000 from Mamadaminov. The Government reported that in 2002 M. Tajibaeva set up an 
illegal voluntary association called the &#8220;Ardent Hearts Club&#8221;. It was reported that she thereupon 
used funds received from abroad to organize unauthorized demonstrations in front of buildings 
housing local authorities and government bodies in Tashkent and Fergana provinces for the 
purpose of putting pressure on them and their representatives. During these demonstrations she 
disseminated false information with full knowledge of this fact. The Government pointed out 
that M. Tajibaeva did not declare the financial assistance received for organizing the activities of 
the &#8220;Ardent Hearts Club&#8221; to the tax authorities and deliberately evaded payment of taxes and 
other charges to the value of 2,042,900. It was reported by the Government&#8217;s communication 
that M. Tajibaeva set up a trading and manufacturing company and used forged documents to 
obtain a loan of 8 million from the National Bank in Margilan, which she diverted for improper 
use. M. Tajibaeva unlawfully used 6.8 hectares of land belonging to the Nomuna shirkat farm in 
the Akhunbabaev district of Fergana province. The Government indicated that, having 
unlawfully taken possession of this plot of land, M. Tajibaeva left it untended, as a result of 
which it was waterlogged and infested with weeds. In consequence the productivity of this 
farmland fell and the provisions on land use and regulations on soil protection were directly 
broached. The Nomuna shirkat farm suffered a total financial loss of 1,601,512 and the Bokijon 
Ota farm a loss of 8,579,304. The land tax was deliberately evaded. The Government indicated 
that the criminal prosecution against M. Tajibaeva is not related to her human rights work, but 
that she has been convicted for perpetrating specific criminal acts. The case is currently being 
prepared for review by the court of appeal.  </p>

Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
 
</b>714. By letter dated 24 January 2006, the Government of Vietnam responded to the joint urgent 
appeal sent on 29 November 2005 concerning <b>Mr Hoang Minh Chinh</b>. The Government stated 
that the allegations outlined in the communication of 29 November 2005 were unfounded. The 
Government indicated that during time spent in the United States for medical treatment, Mr 
Minh Chinh was involved in activities detrimental to the state of Vietnam including urging the 
United States to cut off aid to Vietnam. It was noted that since his return to Vietnam the 
Government has received requests from the public to take disciplinary action against Mr Chinh. 
The Government stated that Mr Chinh&#8217;s life is not in danger and that no complaint has been 
received from him in this regard.

<p>715. On 23 January 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning Mr <b>Sidney 
Saize</b>, a journalist working for the banned <i>Daily News</i>, who was on 18 January 2006, reportedly 
arrested on allegations of &#8220;practicing journalism without accreditation&#8221; as required by the Access 
to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA), and of &quot;publishing falsehoods&quot; regarding 
the contents of a programme apparently broadcast by radio Voice of America. According to 
AIPPA provisions, the first offence carries a two-year prison term, a fine of Z$400,000 (approx. 
$US4,300), or both; the second one carries a maximum fine of Z$100,000 (approx. $US1,080), 
or a five- year jail term, or both. Officers from the Criminal Investigation Department allegedly 
interrogated Saize for three hours following his arrest and then detained him at the local police </p>

station. Saize's lawyer reported that it was unclear when the judiciary would be seized of his 
client&#8217;s arrest and detention, and that he filed an urgent application with the Magistrates Court to 
order the police to proceed in due time. 
 
716. On 16 February 2006, the Special Rapporteur jointly, with the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal 
concerning 181 <i>Women of Zimbabwe Arise</i> (WOZA) activists, among them <b>Jennifer Williams 
</b>and <b>Magodonga Mahlangu</b>. WOZA was a grassroots organization working to promote and 
protect women&#8217;s activism, whose members had already been the subject of previous 
communications on 20 May 2005, 29 September 2004 and 26 September 2003. According to the 
information received, on 13 February 2006, Jennifer Williams, Magodonga Mahlangu and 
approximately 100 other WOZA activists were arrested and detained in central Bulawayo, 
Zimbabwe while they were engaging in a peaceful protest designed to bring attention to the 
social and economic conditions facing the people of Zimbabwe. It was alleged that the detainees 
had been charged with violating section 24 of Public Order and Security Act, for participating in 
an unsanctioned protest and that they were detained at Bulawayo Central Police Station. It was 
reported that they were released on 15 February. According to further information received, on 
14 February 2006, between 60 and 100 WOZA activists were arrested in Harare, Zimbabwe, 
while engaging in a peaceful protest. It was reported that they were being detained at Harare 
Central Police Station. Grave concern is expressed at the above arrests and detentions as it is 
believed that they are connected with legitimate activities of WOZA activists in defence of 
human rights. Further concern is expressed that these arrests and detentions form part of 
campaign against WOZA activists to prevent them from engaging in peaceful protest. 
 
717. On 27 February 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning <b>Gift 
Phiri</b>, previously working for the weekly <i>Zimbabwe Independent</i>. According to the information 
received, on 16 February 2006, Gift Phiri was beaten up by unidentified men in Sunningdale, 
suburb of Harare.  Gift Phiri was reportedly severely injured by the attack, and was left with 
injuries to his ribs and face.  The assailants accused him of working for the American public 
radio station <i>Voice of America (VOA)</i> and one of the few Zimbabwean private radio station <i>Voice 
of People (VOP)</i>, which they referred to as media hostile to the Zimbabwean government.  
Concern was expressed, particularly in light of a report that, on 27 January 2006 on the <i>Manica 
Post, </i>the State Security Minister warned journalists working for foreign media that despite the 
fact that they were often working under pseudonyms, they would be identified.  
 
718. On 21 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur jointly with the Special Rapporteur on adequate 
housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders sent and 
urgent appeal regarding Mrs <b>Felistus Chinyuku</b>, a 65- year- old human rights defender and 
former chairwoman of Porta Farm residents&#8217; committee, who spoke out against forced evictions 
that took place in 2004 and 2005. According to the information received, Felistus Chinyuku 
received persistent threats from the ruling party youth and government officials at Hopley Farm, 
the internally displaced persons&#8217; camp where she used to reside after having been evicted from 
Porta Farm. In particular, it was reported that on 17 October 2005, she was called to a meeting 
attended by the Minister of Local Government, Public Works and Urban Development and other 
government officials.  It was further reported that during this meeting, she was told that she had 
&#8220;sold out&#8221; by giving information to human rights organizations, and was threatened not to be </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 266 
 
allowed to stay at Hopley Farm should she continue to interact with human rights groups. She 
also received death threats.  Subsequently, a residential stand which had been allocated to her 
was reportedly withdrawn, allegedly on the instructions of an official from the Ministry of Public 
Service, Labour and Social Welfare, which runs Hopley Farm IDP camp. As a result of the 
continuing harassment against her and fearing for her safety, Felistus Chinyuku left Hopley 
Farm. Fears were expressed with regards to her safety. Additionally, serious concerns were 
expressed that the recurrent harassment which she was beeing the object of may have 
represented a form of retaliation for her outspoken stance against the eviction and may represent 
a attempt to restrain her freedom of speech and her access to international human rights 
organizations. 
 
719. On 15 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur jointly with the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal concerning Mr <b>Beloved Chiweshe</b>, 
Secretary General of the <i>Zimbabwe National Students Union</i> (ZINASU); other members of 
ZINASU and peaceful participants in a demonstration against increases in school fees. ZINASU 
is an organization that defends the rights of students in Zimbabwe. According to the information 
received, on 4 May 2006, members of the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) entered a meeting 
being held by the ZINASU General Council in Harare, Zimbabwe. It was reported that the police 
officers demanded that those present identify the president of ZINASU. The students were 
reportedly detained overnight and released without charge on 5 May 2006. Furthermore, on 4 
May 2006, it was reported that 73 children, who were participating in a peaceful demonstration 
against increases in school fees, were arrested in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe.  On 8 May 2006 it was 
reported that armed members of Zimbabwe Republic Police entered Bindura University and 
arrested Mr Beloved Chiweshe and 17 other students who were peacefully demonstrating against 
new fee structures for universities. It was reported that the arrested students were assaulted and 
that Mr Beloved Chiweshe and a female demonstrator were injured. It was further reported that 
the demonstrators were taken to Bindura central police station and that they have been released. 
Concern ws expressed that the above events are connected with the activities of the above-
mentioned people in defence of human rights in particular because of their peaceful participation 
in protests to defend the right to education. 
 
720. On 31 July 2006 the Special Rapporteur and the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on the situation of human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal concerning Ms 
<b>Evidence John</b>, Mr <b>Future Matondo</b>, Mr <b>Alinmah T. Munafireyi Rajabo</b>, Ms <b>Florence 
Bundo</b>, Mr <b>Tapuwa Mundangepfupfu</b>, Mr <b>Shelter Zimunhu</b>, Mr <b>Albert Mhetu</b>, Mr <b>Louis 
Chizaka</b>, Ms <b>Shelly Saburi</b>, Mr <b>Stewart Muzhambi</b>, Ms <b>Ruth Katsande </b>and other members 
of the National Constitutional Assembly (NCA). NCA is a group of non-governmental 
organizations that advocates for democratic reform in Zimbabwe. According to the information 
received, on 12 July 2006,  Ms Evidence John, together with 127 other NCA members, were 
arrested in Harare and detained at the Harare Central police station, while participating in a 
peaceful protest calling for democratic reform in Zimbabwe.  They were charged under Section 
46 of the Criminal Law Act, related to the obstruction of traffic. It was further reported that Ms 
Evidence John was denied access to medical treatment after she collapsed while in detention. 
The detainees were released on 15 July 2006 on free bail and were due to appear in court on 4 
August 2006.  On 13 July 2006 Mr Future Matondo, Mr Alinmah T. Munafireyi Rajabo, Ms 
Florence Bundo, Mr Tapuwa Mundangepfupfu, Mr Shelter Zimunhu, Mr Albert Mhetu, Mr 
Louis Chizaka, Ms Shelly Saburi, Mr Stewart Muzhambi and Ms Ruth Katsande were arrested </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
 page 267 
 
and detained in Mutare while participating in a peaceful protest calling for democratic reforms in 
Zimbabwe. It was reported that they were charged under Section 17 of the Criminal Law Act 
which criminalizes demonstrations that pose a threat to public order. It was further reported that 
they were released on bail of 50,000 Zimbabwean dollars each, and that that their hearing would 
take place on 31 July 2006. Concerns were expressed that the above events were connected with 
the activities of the members of NCA in defence of human rights, in particular because of their 
participation in peaceful protests calling for democratic reforms in Zimbabwe. 
 
721. On 21 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur jointly the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal concerning 
the arrest of Mr <b>Wellington Chibebe</b>, General Secretary of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade 
Unions (ZCTU) on 15 August 2006. Mr Chibebe was the subject of an urgent appeal sent on 9 
October 2003, and of a letter of allegation sent on 26 November 2003. Mr Chibebe was again the 
subject of an urgent appeal sent on 15 February 2005. According to the information received, on 
15 August 2006, Mr Chibebe was reportedly arrested at a roadblock and detained at Waterfalls 
Police station as he was traveling by car from Masvingo with his family. He was stopped at a 
roadblock near Waterfalls, where the Police demanded to search his car, supposedly in order to 
look for cash. At first, Mr Chibebe was reportedly accused of &#8220;failure to cooperate with a police 
officer&#8221;. However, according to the information received, the police would have later 
deliberately changed the charges to &#8220;common assault against a police officer&#8221;. On 17 August 17 
2006, Mr Chibebe appeared before the Mbare Magistrates Court. He was reportedly charged of 
contravening section 176 of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act [chapter 9:23], 
which states that &#8220;[a]ny person who assaults or by violent means resists a peace officer acting in 
the course of his or her duty, knowing that he or she is a peace officer or realising that there is a 
risk or possibility that he or she is a peace officer, shall be guilty of assaulting or resisting a 
peace officer and liable to a fine not exceeding level twelve or imprisonment for a period not 
exceeding ten years or both&#8221;. Mr Chibebe was granted ZWD 2000 bail (US$ 8), and the trial date 
was set for 4 September 2006. Concerns were expressed that the reported arrest may be in 
retaliation for his activities in defence of the rights of workers, and may form part of a 
continuous pattern of harassment and repression of Zimbabwe&#8217;s human rights defenders, 
including trade- union leaders. 
 
722. On 15 September 2006  the Special Rapporteur, the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning <b>Wellington Chibhebhe</b>, the Secretary&#8211;General of 
the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Union (ZCTU), <b>Lovemore Matombo</b>, President of the ZCTU, 
Ms <b>Lucia Matibenga</b>, 1st Vice-President of the ZCTU, <b>Ian Makone</b>, Organising Secretary, 
Movement for Democratic Change, Mr <b>Ngondo</b>, Mr <b>Nkiwane</b>, Mr <b>Gumbo</b>, Mr <b>Chigwada</b>, Mr 
<b>Nyahunzvi</b>, and Mr <b>Shonhe</b>. Mr Chibebe was the subject of two urgent appeals sent on 21 
August 2006 and 15 February 2006 and Ms Lucia Matibenga was the subject of the urgent 
appeal sent on 15 February 2006. According to the allegations received, on 13 September 2006, 
they were arrested and detained by the Zimbabwe Republic Police, and then transported to 
Matapi Police Station and severely assaulted and tortured by police officers while in detention. 
The lawyer acting on their behalf was unable to obtain medical assistance for them, despite 
repeated requests. Two of the detainees were alleged to be unconscious the night before, and 
when food was provided in the morning, they were unable to walk, and were incoherent. An 
urgent High Court application has been made to access treatment for the victims. Five other trade </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/27/Add.1 
page 268 
 
unionists are also detained. A large number of others are being detained at Harare Central Police 
Station. Grave concern was expressed that the arrest, detention and torture of Mr Chibhebhe and 
other human rights defenders may be in retaliation for their activities in defence of the rights of 
workers, and may form part of a continuous pattern of harassment and repression of Zimbabwe&#8217;s 
human rights defenders, including trade union leaders. 
 
723. On 15 September 2006, the Special Rapporteur, the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences and the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on the situation of human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal concerning the on-
going harassment of members of the NGO <b><i>Women of Zimbabwe Arise</i></b>  (WOZA). WOZA is a 
grassroots organization working to promote and protect women&#8217;s activism, whose members have 
already been the subject of previous communications on 16 February 2006, 20 May 2005, 29 
September 2004 and 26 September 2003. According to the information received, on 21 August 
2006, over 200 activists from WOZA reportedly took the streets in the city of Bulawayo in order 
to protest over the introduction and implementation of the Monetary Policy by the Governor of 
the Reserve Bank. Among the concerns of the women&#8217;s organisation were the arbitrary searches, 
confiscation and subsequent depositing of old bearer cheques with authorities from the Reserve 
Bank; furthermore, in terms of the regulations issued by the President and being implemented by 
the Reserve Bank Governor, there is reportedly no remedy before the courts to challenge a 
confiscation. In the open letter that WOZA members wanted to deliver to the Governor, they 
protested against the Government&#8217;s alleged solution to Zimbabwe&#8217;s economic crisis, the so-
called &#8220;Operation Sunrise&#8221;. At around 11.15 a.m., the activists reportedly began their procession 
along Main Street. They were then intercepted by the police at the corner of Leopold Takawira 
Avenue and Main Street. It was alleged that the police arrested 153 of the women, who were 
brought to five separate holding places and police cells, namely: Bulawayo Central, Saucitown 
Police Station, Mzilikazi, Queens Park, and Barbourfields Police. Later on that day, their lawyers 
managed to secure the release of 39 persons, on condition that they report to Bulawayo Central 
Police everyday until the date of the initial appearance in court. During their arrest, Ms <b>Ephy 
Khumalo</b>, one of WOZA activists, reportedly fell from the police truck and sustained a fractured 
arm. Besides, several juveniles complained of beatings while being interrogated by members of 
the Law and Order Section at Bulawayo Central before being released into the custody of their 
lawyers. On 23 August 2006, the activists appeared in court and were charged for contravening 
section 37(1) (b) of the Criminal Law Codification and Reform Act, which provides that &#8220;any 
person acting together with one or more other persons present with him or her in any place or at 
any meeting performs any action, utters any words or distributes or displays any writing, sign or 
other visible representation that is obscene, threatening, abusive or insulting, intending thereby to 
provoke a breach of the peace or realising that there is a risk or possibility that a breach of the 
peace may be provoked shall be guilty of participating in a gathering with intent to promote 
public violence, a breach of the peace or bigotry, as the case may be, and be liable to a fine not 
exceeding level ten or imprisonment for a period not exceeding five years or both&#8221;. However, on 
the same day, all WOZA activists were granted free bail and remanded out of custody. They are 
due to appear in Court on 10 October 2006. Concern was expressed that these arrest, detention 
and conviction of WOZA members are linked to their activities in defence of human rights, in 
particular women&#8217;s rights, and may form part of a campaign of harassment and intimidation 
against human rights defenders in Zimbabwe.

724. On 7 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur jointly with the the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on Independence of 
Judges and Lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights defenders sent an urgent appeal concerning the situation of members of <b>Women of 
Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA)</b> and <b>Men of Zimbabwe Arise</b> <b>(MOZA).</b> WOZA, and its 
subdivision MOZA, is a grassroots organization working to promote and protect women&#8217;s 
activism, whose members have already been the subject of previous communications on 15 
September 2006, 16 February 2006, 28 June 2005, 20 May 2005, 29 September 2004 and 26 
September 2003.  On 31 August 2005, your Excellency&#8217;s Government replied to the 
communication of 28 June 2005, which had concerned events similar to those now reported to 
us. While we welcome that reply, it did not allay our concerns. According to the allegations 
recently received, on 29 November 2006, more than 60 WOZA members and four MOZA 
members were arrested while demonstrating peacefully through central Bulawayo to the 
government offices at Mhlanhlandlela. The march, composed of 200 participants, was to mark 
the launch of the People&#8217;s Charter and the &#8220;16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence&#8221;, an 
international campaign running until International Human Rights Day on 10 December, as well 
as to protest against the Public Order Security Act (POSA). A large group of riot police officers 
allegedly assaulted the group with baton sticks, forcefully dispersing most of it. Many people &#8211; 
including a young baby &#8211; were beaten, and received medical care at Mpilo Hospital. Forty -one 
persons were reportedly taken to Drill Hall by police officers who subsequently beat them, 
before releasing them without charge on the same day. The other marchers, including WOZA 
leaders Ms Jenni Williams and Ms Magodonga Mahlangu, were taken to Bulawayo Central 
Police Station, and 36 members, including six mothers with babies, spent the night there. On 30 
November 2006, the six mothers with babies were released. As of 1 December 2006, 34 
WOZA/MOZA members reportedly remained in police custody, beyond the 48-hours limit 
provided for by law. WOZA and MOZA members, including the six mothers released, were 
charged on 1 December 2006 under two separate sections of the Criminal Law (Codification and 
Reform) Act: Chapter 46 section 2 (v) &#8211; &#8220;employing any means whatsoever which are likely 
materially to interfere with the ordinary comfort, convenience, peace or quiet of the public, or 
does any act which is likely create a nuisance or obstruction&#8221; and Chapter 37 &#8211; &#8221;participating in 
a public gathering with the intent to cause public disorder, breach of peace or bigotry&#8221;. If found 
guilty, the members could be fined or imprisoned for a period not exceeding six months or both.  
A lawyer for WOZA was also threatened with arrest for &#8220;interfering with the course of justice&#8221; 
whilst trying to attend to her clients. She only managed to see the group on 30 November 2006, 
in the afternoon, several hours after being in police custody. Serious concern was expressed 
about these new arrests of WOZA/MOZA members and the charges against them are in relation 
to their legitimate activities in defence of human rights, in particular the promotion and 
protection of women&#8217;s rights. This concern was reinforced by the fact that this incident took 
place on the occasion of the first International Day on Women Human Rights Defenders 
celebrated every 29 November. Further concern was expressed that this new instance of 
repression against WOZA/MOZA members may have formed part of a campaign of harassment 
and intimidation against human rights defenders in Zimbabwe.

<b>Replies from the Government 
 
</b>725. By letter dated 20 February 2006, the Government of Zimbabwe replied to the 
communication of 23 January 2006, indicating that <b>Siney Saize</b> was arrested on 18 January 2006 
for practicing journalism without being accredited and for communicating falsehoods, 
contravening section 83(1) of the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act as well as 
section 15(1) of the Public Order and Security Act (POSA). The Government informed that Saize 
was heard by a Mutare municipal employee speaking on his mobile phone about an alleged 
politically motivated assault involving two Secondary school teachers who were said to have 
been assaulted by some Border Gezi youths, war veterans and Zanu PF youths. The two victims 
were reported by Saize to be in a serious condition. Checks with school have since established 
that no such teachers were ever assaulted giving rise to the charge under POSA for publishing 
falsehoods. It was later established that Saize had been filing this false story for Voice of 
America&#8217;s Studio 7. The Government indicated that Saize is not accredited as a journalist in 
accordance with the law and therefore cannot practice as such. On 21 January 2006, Saize was 
taken to court under Mutare Central CR 222-3/01/06, afterwhich he was released and the public 
prosecutor is still considering the case. Besides, the Government indicated that Saize had not 
lodged a complaint with the Police concerning this matter. It was reported by the Government 
that the gravity of the false story was to further injure the image of the Border Gezi youths by 
alleging falsehoods, and that the inclusion of war veterans was done with a view to inculcating 
fear in those hearing the story with the result that the audience would believe that there is a 
breakdown of law and order in Zimbabwe. The Government also pointed out that freedom of 
opinion and expression is guaranteed in Zimbabwe, which has many newspaper publications, 
some of which are critical of the present government and its leadership.  
 
726. By letter dated 31 March 2006, the Permanent Mission of the Republic of Zimbabwe to 
the United Nations replied to the communication of 16 February 2006 concerning <b>Women of 
Zimbabwe Arise</b> (WOZA) activists, among them <b>Jennifer Williams</b> and <b>Magodonga 
Mahlangu</b>.  The Mission stated that on 14 February 2006, Jennifer Williams and Magodonga 
Mahlangu were charged under section 24 of the Public Order and Security Act (POSA) for 
failing to notify the Regulating Authority of their intention to organize a public demonstration 
which took place in central Bulawayo on 13 February 2006.  It was noted that the recording of 
statements and fingerprinting of Jennifer Williams and Magodonga Mahlanga was conducted in 
line with normal police procedures.  Other demonstrators were charged under the Miscellaneous 
Offences Act for conduct likely to provoke the breach of peace and were due to be summonsed.  
On 15 February 2006, 149 WOZA members were required to pay fines after participating in a 
demonstration the previous day. They were charged with contravening Section 7c of the 
Miscellaneous Offences Act.  The Mission responded to allegations that suspects arrested in 
Harare with their babies were detained in open cells and separate from other inmates.  The letter 
also states that Tafadzwa Mugabe, a lawyer from ZLHR who was amongst a group of protesters 
arrested at the demonstration, was released when he produced his business identity card.  The 
Mission further stated that the Zimbabwean Republic Police force has committed itself to the 
observance of human rights in discharging its duties. 
 
727. By letter dated 11 September 2006, the Permanent Mission of the Republic of Zimbabwe 
to the United Nations replied to the communication of 21 August 2006 concerning the arrest of 
<b>Mr Wellington Chibebe</b>, General Secretary of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions </p>

(ZCTU) at a roadblock on 15 August 2006.  The Mission stated that an investigation was 
initiated by the Waterfalls Police Station into the case.  The letter noted that Mr Chibebe had 
appeared in court on 17 August 2006 charged with contravening Sections 76 and 89 of the 
Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act Chapter 9.23 for resisting arrest and assaulting a 
police officer.  The Mission stated that prior to Mr Chibebe&#8217;s arrest the aforementioned 
roadblock had been widely publicized by the media and was intended to curtail money-
laundering.  It was noted that everyone, irrespective of social status, was searched at the 
roadblock including a police officer who was arrested and tried.  Mr Chiebebe&#8217;s identity was not 
known to police officers at the time of his arrest.  
 
728. By letter dated 14 December 2006, the Permanent Mission of the Republic of Zimbabwe 
to the United Nations replied to the communication of 7 December 2006 concerning the situation 
of members of <b>Women of Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA)</b> and <b>Men of Zimbabwe Arise (MOZA).  
</b>The Mission stated that<b> </b>according to a police report issued by the Z.R. Police General 
Headquarters, 40 members of WOZA, including Ms Jennifer Williams, were arrested on 29 
November 2006.  Members of the group were taken to Bulawayo Police Station were they were 
detained in police cells.  The group was subsequently charged with intent to promote public 
violence, breach of peace or bigotry by participating in a public gathering, under Section 37 (1) 
(b) of the Criminal Codification Act Chapter 9:23.  The letter indicates that the group was taken 
to Court on 1 December 2006, where the Public Prosecutor declined to place them on remand, 
and advised police to proceed with a summons.  The Mission states that those arrested were not 
subjected to assault by police nor was there any record of a child being among those arrested.  
WOZA&#8217;s legal representative, Perpetua Dube, was permitted to see her clients without threats 
from the police, and there is no record of a complaint issued by Ms Dube for alleged threats 
against her.  
 
<b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b> 
729. By letter dated 11 July 2006, the Government of Zimbabwe responded to the joint urgent 
appeal sent on 3 November 2005 concerning <b>Nyaungwe Officen, Claris Madhuku, 
Masunungure Sozwaphi, Makatura Isiah </b>and<b> Shonhiwa Wilson</b>. The Government 
acknowledged receipt of the aforementioned communication and stated that the matter is being 
investigated and that developments will be advised in due course. 
 
730. By letter dated 23 January 2006, the Government of Zimbabwe responded to the joint 
urgent appeal sent on 16 November 2005 concerning <b>Ms Netsai Mushonga</b>. The Government 
stated that in order to provide a meaningful reply to the aforementioned communication, 
information regarding the name of the police station at which the complainant was detained, the 
identity of the police officers involved, as well as information as to whether Ms Mushonga was 
arrested whilst addressing the meeting along with the name of the court at which she is due to 
appear, would have been required. However the Government indicated that based on previous 
experience some sections of the community have vowed to defy the provisions of the Public and 
Security Act. According to Section 24 of the Act the authorities must be notified four days in 
advance of all public gatherings, meetings or processions, in order to allow the police to decide 
whether protection is required or not. The Government noted that this provision was not unique 
to Zimbabwe and that it is common practice in most democratic states.
