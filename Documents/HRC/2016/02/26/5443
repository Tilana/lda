discrimination, which are harder to identify and to act upon. Reference was also made to the 
persistence of discrimination and the consistency in the number of racial discrimination charges 
filed every year since 1964.

</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur visited the United States of 
America from 19 May to 6 June 2008. During the mission, the Special Rapporteur visited 
Washington, D.C., New York, Chicago, Omaha, Los Angeles, New Orleans and the Louisiana 
and Mississippi Gulf Coast, Miami and San Juan (Puerto Rico). 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur had extensive meetings with state institutions, including the 
Supreme Court, civil society organizations active in the field of racism, minority communities 
and victims of racism.  
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur formulates several recommendations, including that: 
</p>
<p> (a) Congress establish a bipartisan commission to evaluate the progress and failures in 
the fight against racism and the ongoing process of resegregation, particularly in housing and 
education, and to find responses to check these trends; 
</p>
<p> (b) The Government reassess existing legislation on racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance in view of two main guidelines: addressing the overlapping 
nature of poverty and race or ethnicity; and linking the fight against racism to the construction of 
a democratic, egalitarian and interactive multiculturalism, in order to strengthen inter-community 
relations; 
</p>
<p> (c) The Government should intensify its efforts to enforce federal civil rights laws; 
</p>
<p> (d) The Government clarify to law enforcement officials the obligation of equal 
treatment and, in particular, the prohibition of racial profiling. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/36/Add.<footnote name="3">3. In his meeting with the Vice-Chair of EEOC, the Special Rapporteur was informed about 
the E-RACE Initiative (Eradicating Racism and Colorism from Employment). The Initiative has 
some clearly defined goals, including to improve data collection in order to better identify, 
investigate and prosecute allegations of discrimination, improve the quality of EEOC&#8217;s litigation, 
develop strategies to tackle emerging issues of race and color discrimination, promote voluntary 
compliance to eradicate race and color discrimination.

national origin is prohibited under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII). The enforcement 
of these provisions, along with other legislation prohibiting employment discrimination is 
conducted by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The EEOC has a total 
staff of some 2200 employees in 52 offices throughout the country and a budget of around 
US$ 330 million, which allows it to file around 80,000 charges per year. In 2007, charges related 
to employment discrimination based on race were 37 percent of the total whereas national origin 
represented 11.4 percent of all charges.

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur visited the United States of 
America from 19 May to 6 June 2008 ((Washington, D.C., New York, Chicago, Omaha, 
Los Angeles, New Orleans and the Louisiana and Mississippi Gulf Coast, Miami and San Juan, 
Puerto Rico). He held extensive meetings with federal authorities at the executive, legislative and 
judicial branches as well as with local authorities (see appendix). 
2. Apart from the agenda with state institutions, including the Supreme Court, the Special 
Rapporteur also had extensive meetings with civil society organizations active in the area of 
racism and xenophobia, minority communities as well as victims of racism and racial 
discrimination.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur wishes to express his gratitude to the Government of the 
United States for its full cooperation and openness throughout the visit as well as a particular 
appreciation to Justice Stephen Breyer at the Supreme Court. He also wishes to express his 
sincere thanks to all civil society organizations that actively participated and contributed to the 
success of his mission. In particular, he wishes to thank Global Rights for its support throughout 
the mission. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  GENERAL BACKGROUND 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Historical and political context  
</b></p>
<p>4. The first inhabitants of North America are believed to have arrived crossing from the 
Bering Strait towards the end of the last Ice Age. Before the advent of European explorers in the 
late 15th century, a population of one to two million people is believed to have populated 
North America. Epidemic diseases brought by the Europeans and violence obliterated many 
Native American peoples.  
</p>
<p>5. The United States of America became an independent State after the American 
Revolutionary War (1775-1783). The three documents that emerged from independence &#8211; the 
Declaration of Independence (1776), the United States Constitution (1787) and the Bill of Rights 
(1791) &#8211; are among the first formal legally-binding documents recognizing inalienable individual 
rights such as freedom of religion, freedom of expression and freedom of assembly. 
</p>
<p>6. The contradictions between the agrarian and slave-based South and the manufacturing, 
liberalizing and generally anti-slavery North exploded when the Republican candidate, 
Abraham Lincoln, won the 1860 presidential election. By that time, 4 million slaves and 
488,000 free blacks lived in the United States alongside 27 million whites. While the American 
Civil War (1861-1865) brought about the legal end of slavery and the adoption of the fourteenth 
amendment to the Constitution, including the equal protection clause, differential treatment to 
blacks living in the South would continue well into the twentieth century. Jim Crow laws were 
enacted in many States, legitimated by the &#8220;separate but equal&#8221; doctrine legitimated by the 
Supreme Court in <i>Plessy v Fergunson</i>.  
</p>
<p>7. The &#8220;separate but equal&#8221; doctrine remained until the emergence of the civil rights 
movement in the mid-twentieth century. Though the starting point of the movement is difficult to </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/36/Add.3 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>trace, the landmark decision by the Supreme Court on <i>Brown v Board of Education</i> in 1954, 
striking down racial segregation in schools, certainly had a fundamental impact in unleashing the 
changes that took place in subsequent years. The movement culminated in the adoption of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964, a milestone document that set the institutional framework for the 
protection of human rights in contemporary United States of America.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Demographic, ethnic and religious composition  
</b></p>
<p>8. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2006 the United States had a population of 
around 299 million, composed as follows: 73.<footnote name="9">4. The Special Rapporteur recalls the idea that he has put forward in many of his reports 
concerning the need to go beyond a legal strategy that guarantees non-discrimination. While 
essential, the legal strategy is only the first stage in the fight against racism. A long-term strategy 
needs to address the root causes of the phenomenon, particularly in terms of intellectual </footnote> percent white, 12.4 percent black or 
African American, 4.4 percent Asian, 0.<footnote name="8">5. Throughout his mission and in the analysis of documents, the Special Rapporteur was 
exposed to three broad types of issues: instances of direct racial discrimination; laws and policies </footnote> percent American Indian and Alaska Native, 
0.1 percent Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, 6.3 percent of other races and 2 percent 
of people with two or more races. The U.S. Census Bureau correctly does not define Hispanic or 
Latinos as a race, as individuals of South and Central American origin may be of any race. 
In 2006 Hispanics or Latinos composed 14.<footnote name="8">4. The Special Rapporteur identified a number of challenges in the fight against racism that 
should be addressed, both at the Federal and local levels. 
</footnote> percent of the population.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>9. In 2007, the foreign-born population in the United States (those not U.S. citizens or 
U.S. nationals at birth) amounted to approximately 38 million people, or 12.6 percent of the total 
population.<b>3</b> 42.5 percent of those foreign born residents were naturalized citizens. Out of the 
foreign born population, 47.5 percent are Hispanics, 23.4 percent are Asians, 20.3 percent are 
non-Hispanic whites and 7.8 percent are blacks. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  International human rights instruments 
</b></p>
<p>10. The United States is party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR),<b>4</b> the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination (ICERD) and other international human rights instruments. With respect to both 
the ICCPR and the ICERD, the United States has adopted a number of formal reservations, 
understandings and declarations. In the case of ICERD, with respect to Articles 4 and 7, and in 
the case of ICCPR, with respect to Article 20, the United States has taken treaty reservations to 
these provisions, explaining that their scope is at odds with the extensive protections contained in 
the U.S. Constitution and U.S. laws in the areas of individual freedom of speech, expression and 
association.

</p>
<p><b>D.  Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur carried out extensive meetings with authorities at the executive, 
legislative and judiciary branches to collect their views and opinions as well as information 
concerning government programmes, legislation and judicial decisions. Additionally, an agenda 
with civil society organizations, communities and associations representing minority groups, 
victims of discrimination, journalists and student leaders was organized.  
12. The Special Rapporteur structured his meetings around three questions: (i) Is there still 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in the United States? (ii) If so, 
who are their main victims and what are their main manifestations and expressions? (iii) What 
are or should be the governmental policies and programmes to fight these phenomena at the 
political, legal and cultural levels? 
</p>
<p><b>II.  LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p>13. The fourteenth amendment of the Constitution, adopted on the aftermath of the Civil War, 
contains an Equal Protection Clause that formally recognizes the principle of equality before the 
law. It provides that &#8220;[No State shall] <i>deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal 
protection of the laws</i>&#8221;. The fifteenth amendment, ratified on 3 February 1870, further extends 
the right to vote to all races. 
</p>
<p>14. The civil rights movement in the 1960s led to the signature by President 
Lyndon B. Johnson of the Civil Rights Act in 1964. The Act constitutes a historic landmark in 
the elimination of <i>de jure </i>racial discrimination in the country and to set up the institutional and 
legal structure to combat discrimination. The Act also set up the Commission on Civil Rights, 
which was mandated to inter alia investigate denials of the right to vote, study and collect 
information concerning legal developments constituting a denial of equal protection of the laws 
under the Constitution and appraise the laws and policies of the Federal Government in this 
regard.<b>5</b> The Act was further complemented by the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which prohibited 
discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing. 
</p>
<p>15. The enforcement of non-discrimination provisions of the Constitution and federal 
legislation is primarily carried out by the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice, 
which is composed of over 700 staff. The Civil Rights Division carries out enforcement actions 
in areas that include criminal cases, disability rights, education, employment, housing and 
voting. Other Federal agencies are also involved in the enforcement of equal protection 
legislation, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Office of Fair 
Housing and Equal Opportunity at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

</p>
<p><b>III. PUBLIC POLICIES AND MEASURES TO FIGHT RACISM, RACIAL 
DISCRIMINATION, XENOPHOBIA AND RELATED INTOLERANCE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Law enforcement  
</b></p>
<p>16. Law enforcement in the United States involves agencies at the federal, state and local 
levels. While the Special Rapporteur met with several officials at the local level, his analysis is 
based primarily on agencies, and policies developed, at the Federal level.  
</p>
<p>17. Racial discrimination by law enforcement agencies is prohibited by the Constitution and 
federal statutes.<b>6</b> These include the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 
and the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. Officials at the Civil Rights 
Division of the Department of Justice underscored the fundamental importance that it attaches to 
combating police misconduct, including racial discrimination by police officers, which amounts 
to approximately half of its Criminal Section&#8217;s caseload.  
</p>
<p>18. Officials at the Civil Rights Division as well as at the Department of Homeland Security 
highlighted the importance of training of law enforcement officials. A Federal Law Enforcement 
Training Center exists since 1970 and currently provides law enforcement training to over 
80 Federal agencies. Particular trainings focusing on cultural awareness and relations with 
minority communities have also been developed.  
</p>
<p>19. In what concerns overrepresentation of minorities in the criminal justice system, it was 
recognized that disparities in incarceration rates exist between minorities, particularly African 
Americans, and whites. However, as the United States affirmed in its latest periodic report to the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD), the reasons for such disparities 
are complex and do not necessarily indicate differential treatment of persons in the criminal 
justice system.<b>7</b>  
<i>Racial profiling</i> 
20. The Supreme Court has produced solid jurisprudence prohibiting racial profiling. For 
example, in <i>Wren v. United States</i> (1996), the Court stated that &#8220;the Constitution prohibits 
selective enforcement of the law based on considerations such as race&#8221;, making explicit 
reference to the Equal Protection Clause. In <i>United States v. Armstrong</i> (1996), repeating <i>Oyler 
v. Boles</i> (1962), the Court further affirmed that &#8220;the decision whether to prosecute may not be 
based on &#8216;an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification&#8221;. 
The ruling in <i>United States v. Montero-Camargo </i>(1996) further cautioned against the use of 
factors that are facially race-neutral but in effect can be discriminatorily used against minorities 
(e.g. searches against individuals living in &#8220;high-crime&#8221; areas that are also predominantly 
inhabited by minorities). 
</p>

  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>21. In June 2003, responding to a call made by President Bush in his State of the Union 
address in 2001, the Department of Justice issued a <i>Guidance Regarding the Use of Race by 
Federal Law Enforcement Agencies</i> prohibiting the use of race or ethnicity in law enforcement 
practices, the first time such guidelines have been issued. The guidance was formally adopted by 
the Department of Homeland Security in June 2004. Officials at the Civil Rights Division 
highlighted that the guidelines were also incorporated in the training modules that all law 
enforcement officials have to undergo. While officials recognized that the guidelines do not 
create rights that can be affirmed in court, they highlighted that racial profiling violates the equal 
protection clause of the Constitution, which therefore offers overarching protection against this 
practice. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Hate crimes 
</b></p>
<p>22. According to the U.S. Criminal Code, crimes motivated by race, color, religion or national 
origin can be investigated and prosecuted by federal authorities only when the crime occurs 
because of the victim&#8217;s participation in a federally protected activity (e.g. public education, 
employment, etc).<b>8</b> In cases that do not meet the latter requirement, the jurisdiction lies at the 
state level. Apart from federal regulations, 47 states have laws on hate crimes. 
</p>
<p>23. The number of hate crimes reported in the United States has decreased from 8,063 reported 
incidents in 2000 to 7,624 reported incidents in 2007, a fact that was highlighted by officials at 
the Civil Rights Division. The trend in the past two years is however the opposite, with a 
6 percent increase from 2005 to 2007. In 2001, a peak of 9,730 such incidents was reached 
(a 20 percent increase in comparison to 2000), which the FBI Hate Crimes Statistics relates to 
the aftermath of 9/11. The number of yearly reported incidents fell back to its normal trend 
from 2002.  
</p>
<p>24. In 2007, 3,642 incidents (48.8 percent of total) were motivated by race (68 percent of 
which were anti-Black); 1,426 incidents (19.1 percent of total) were motivated by religion 
(65.2 percent of which were anti-Jewish and 10.8 percent anti-Islamic); and 1,102 incidents 
(14.7 percent of total) were related to ethnicity or national origin (43.5 percent of which were 
anti-Hispanic).<b>9</b>  
</p>
<p>25. Officials highlighted the prompt and decisive action of the Civil Rights Division in the 
aftermath of 9/11 by quickly bringing a number of cases against perpetrators of hate crimes. In 
particular, 32 &#8220;<footnote name="9">2. The Special Rapporteur would like to make specific reference to the situation of Native 
Americans, which have been the first people to be historically discriminated in the continent. He 
was particularly sensitive to the statements made by the Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, 
Mr. Chad Smith, whom the Special Rapporteur met in Miami, as well as other indigenous 
leaders met in Omaha and Los Angeles, who highlighted the dire socio-economic conditions 
faced by many Native Americans and the difficulties in preserving their cultural heritage. He 
recalls the need for constant vigilance for the situation of Native Americans, which should be the 
subject of particular attention in view of the historical legacy of discrimination against them. 
93. The situation in Puerto Rico also merits particular attention by the Government in view of 
its specificity. A number of particular elements should be borne in mind with regards to 
Puerto Rico: the ethnic dimension, including the racial make-up of the population and the 
situation of the black minority in the island; the cultural dimension, including the Hispanic origin 
of the population; and the political dimension, in particular the specific political status enjoyed 
by Puerto Rico in the United States. It is therefore essential that specific actions, in line with 
Puerto Rico&#8217;s specificities, be undertaken to fight racism in the island. 
</footnote>/11 backlash&#8221; cases were brought, involving 42 offenders, 35 of whom were 
convicted. This response, which involved cooperation with state and local officials, is considered 
as a key factor in explaining the rapid drop in the number of hate crimes after the peak reached in 
the aftermath of 9/11.

</b>  See 18 U.S.C. 245. Other statutes related to hate crimes include conspiracy against rights

the right to fair housing (18 U.S.C. 3631) and criminal interference with voting rights 
(42 U.S.C. 1973).

</p>
<p><b>C.  Education 
</b></p>
<p>26. Educational policy at the federal level is carried out by the Department of Education. An 
Office for Civil Rights within the Department is mandated &#8220;to ensure equal access to education 
and to promote educational excellence throughout the nation through vigorous enforcement of 
civil rights&#8221;. This Office enforces several federal laws that prohibit discrimination, including 
Titles VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (discrimination on the basis of race, color and national 
origin). The Office for Civil Rights enforces this law in all institutions, including elementary and 
secondary schools, colleges and universities that receive funds from the Department of 
Education.  
</p>
<p>27. An important piece of federal legislation in the domain of education is the No Child Left 
Behind Act, which was enacted by Congress in 2002. One of its key objectives is to promote 
more accountability in public schools and to improve the performance of students. In this regard, 
it also explicitly addresses the need to close the achievement gap between white and minority 
students.<b>10</b> Recent data indicates that although the achievement gap is still large, it has narrowed 
in recent years.<b>11</b> 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Housing 
</b></p>
<p>28. Extensive legislation to prevent discrimination on housing and lending has been set up 
over the past decades. This includes the Fair Housing Act (Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 
1968), which prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental or financing of housing on the basis of 
race, color, religion, sex, familial status or national origin. The Act expanded the protections 
offered by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI), which prohibited discrimination in programs 
and activities receiving federal financial assistance but refrained from regulating private conduct 
in the domain of housing. 
</p>
<p>29. Federal laws on fair housing are administered and enforced by the Office of Fair Housing 
and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 
The number of complaints filed with HUD and the Fair Housing Assistance Program (which 
provides grants to State and local fair housing enforcement agencies) has increased substantially 
in the last ten years, from 5,818 complaints in 1998 to 10,154 in 2007. However, it is not evident 
whether this reflects an increase in housing discrimination or better knowledge of fair housing 
laws and willingness to report cases of discrimination. In 2007, 43 percent of complaints were 
based on disability, 37 percent on race, 14 percent on family status and 14 percent on national 
origin.<b>12</b>

<p>30. The Special Rapporteur was informed of a number of programs carried out by HUD to 
promote equal housing opportunity, including financial assistance to public and private 
institutions carrying out monitoring and enforcement activities of fair housing laws. HUD also 
has a constant output of relevant research and advocacy materials, which are used not only to 
raise awareness regarding existing legislation, but also to monitor and inform relevant 
stakeholders regarding emerging trends and challenges. 
</p>
<p>31. The Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice also carries out enforcement of fair 
housing laws. As an example of the role played by the Division, the Special Rapporteur was 
informed of two initiatives. The Fair Housing Testing Program uses paired testing techniques to 
detect cases of discrimination in the housing market. In addition, by launching operation <i>Home 
Sweet Home </i>in 2006, the Department of Justice committed to conduct a record number of tests to 
expose and combat discriminatory practices in housing.

<p><b>F. Measures to prevent discrimination in the aftermath  
of the events of 11 September 2001 
</b></p>
<p>36. Many officials have noted symbolic and concrete actions taken to prevent discrimination 
against people of Arab and Muslim descent in the aftermath of 9/11, starting with the remarks 
made by President Bush during a visit to the Islamic Center on 17 September 2001.<b>13</b> These 
community outreach efforts were described as a best practice in the fight against terrorism by the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
while countering terrorism in his report on the United States.<b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur was briefed on the <i>Initiative to Combat Post 9/11 Discriminatory 
Backlash</i>, designed by the Department of Justice to combat violations of civil rights against 
Arab, Muslim, Sikh and South-Asian Americans.<b>15</b> Key strategies within this programme include 
measures to ensure that cases of discrimination are reported and handled promptly, identifying 
policies that might  involve bias crimes and discrimination and reaching out to affected 
communities to inform them of existing mechanisms. Two special positions were created at the 
Civil Rights Division: a Special Counsel for Post 9/11 National Origin Discrimination and a 
Special Counsel for Religious Discrimination.  
</p>
<p>38. Experts from the Department of Homeland Security also highlighted some initiatives 
developed after 9/11 to prevent discrimination against people of Arab and Muslim descent. 
Reference was made to the <i>Guidance Regarding the Use of Race by Federal Law Enforcement 
Agencies</i>, in particular its provision that &#8220;in investigating or preventing threats to national 
security or other catastrophic events [&#8230;] Federal law enforcement officers may not consider race 
or ethnicity except to the extent permitted by the Constitution and laws of the United States&#8221;. 
The Special Rapporteur was also informed of the Traveller Redress Inquiry Program, which 
allows the public to clarify problems of misidentifications with individuals placed on watch 
lists.<b>16</b> 
</p>
<p><b>G.  Measures taken in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina 
</b></p>
<p>39. Since the Special Rapporteur received allegations concerning possible racial bias in 
reconstruction efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, he raised the issue with several 
Government authorities in order to collect additional information from some of the federal 
agencies and visited affected areas.

</p>
<p>40. The Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice highlighted its proactive role in the 
aftermath of Katrina, reflected in the launching of Operation Home Sweet Home in 
February 2006. While the initiative had a nationwide focus, it initially concentrated on the areas 
where Katrina victims were relocated, increasing the reach of its testing programme to identify 
cases of housing discrimination. Emphasis was also place in areas where a surge of hate crimes 
had occurred, as these crimes are often correlated with housing discrimination.<b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>41. The Department of Housing and Urban Development noted actions developed to provide 
adequate housing to those displaced by Katrina. These include additional disaster-relief funding 
for the affected areas; limited extensions of a foreclosure moratorium; grants for home-owners 
whose houses were damaged or destroyed; and funding to local public housing projects. The 
Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at HUD also developed proactive actions to raise 
awareness in the Gulf coast region about fair housing obligations, in cooperation with the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which leads relief efforts. 
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur also makes reference to the United States latest periodic report to 
CERD, which analyzed concerns about the disparate effects of Katrina on racial or ethnic 
minorities. In the report, the United States stated that &#8220;recognizing the overlap between race and 
poverty in the United States, many commentators conclude nonetheless that the post-Katrina 
issues were the result of poverty (i.e., the inability of many of the poor to evacuate) rather than 
racial discrimination <i>per se</i>&#8221;.<b>18</b> 
</p>
<p><b>H.  Immigration 
</b></p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur met with the Office of Citizenship at the U.S. Citizenship and 
Immigration Service (CIS), and was briefed concerning CIS&#8217;s policy to reinvigorate assimilation 
efforts, particularly in what concerns English proficiency of migrants. Officials pointed out that 
they viewed assimilation of migrants into the United States as a key element for integration into 
the labor market, the educational system and social life more broadly, but this did not imply the 
abandonment of cultural or religious diversity, upon which the United States was founded. The 
Special Rapporteur was informed that CIS had intensified its efforts to diminish the backlog in 
citizenship applications and thus respond more rapidly to applicants.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>44. CIS officials referred to the naturalization exam, which has been recently reformed in 
order to become more uniform nationwide. The naturalization test contains an English reading 
and writing section as well as questions on U.S. history and government. CIS produces and

available to new immigrants with information on rights and responsibilities as well as practical 
help on issues such as employment education and taxes.<b>20</b> 
</p>
<p>45. Immigrants are entitled to some constitutionally-protected rights regardless of their 
immigration status. In <i>Plyler v. Doe</i>, the Supreme Court established that denying free public 
education to children on the basis of immigration status is unlawful. Furthermore, although the 
Immigration and Nationality Act protects only documented migrants from employment 
discrimination, unfair documentary practices and retaliation, EEOC noted several judicial 
decisions that prevent courts from disclosing the immigration status of plaintiffs in employment 
discrimination cases.   
</p>
<p><b>IV.  VIEWS OF CIVIL SOCIETY AND COMMUNITIES CONCERNED 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Law enforcement  
</b></p>
<p>46. One of the key issues mentioned by civil society was the weak record of civil rights 
enforcement by the Federal Government. In particular, reference was made to the limited number 
of cases filed by the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, especially when 
compared to previous administrations. This has led to a growing perception of discredit by civil 
society organizations in the Division&#8217;s commitment to enforce civil rights laws. 
</p>
<p><i>Racial disparities in the criminal justice system 
</i>47. The most critical issue of concern raised by civil society organizations, minority 
communities and victims themselves was related to racial disparities in the criminal justice 
system. Interlocutors pointed to an overrepresentation of individuals belonging to racial and 
ethnic minorities in the criminal justice system. While in mid-2007 black males constituted 
around 12.5 percent of the population, they comprised 38.9 percent of the number of people in 
U.S. prisons and jails.<b>21</b> Black males are therefore 6.5 more likely to be incarcerated than white, 
non-Hispanic males. While many civil society organizations agreed that part of the explanation 
to these disparities is related to social factors, particularly the overlap of poverty and race, it was 
pointed out that racial discrimination also plays a key role in explaining this phenomenon.  
</p>
<p>48. Studies have identified racial disparities at several stages of law enforcement activities. A 
key example is traffic stops. A report by the Department of Justice recently found that whereas 
white, black and Hispanic drivers were stopped by the police at similar rates, black and Hispanic 
drivers were approximately 2.5 times more likely to be searched; the rate of arrests was two 
times higher for blacks and 50 percent higher for Hispanics; blacks were 3.5 times more likely

</p>
<p>and Hispanics were almost 2 times more likely to experience use of police force.<b>22</b> Another 
example concerns sentencing outcomes. A majority of studies show evidence of racially 
discriminatory sentencing; in particular, that individuals belonging to minorities tend to be 
disadvantaged in terms of the decision to incarcerate or not and in receiving harsher sentences 
than white individuals with comparable social and economic status.<b>23</b> 
</p>
<p>49. Mandatory minimum penalties have been pointed out as an important factor that promotes 
racial bias. A striking example refers to mandatory minimum sentences for possession of crack 
and powder cocaine. These sentences establish more severe penalties for persons arrested for 
possessing or selling crack cocaine, 81 percent of whom are African American, than for those in 
possession of or selling powder cocaine, 71.8 percent of whom are white or Hispanic.<b>24</b> 
</p>
<p>50. Civil society also pointed to evidences of racial bias in the application of the death penalty. 
In 2005, African Americans comprised nearly 42 percent of the number of death row inmates but 
only around 12 percent of the general population.<b>25</b> The key factor that shows evidence of racial 
bias in the death penalty, according to many organizations, is the race of the victim. Nationwide, 
even though the absolute number of murders of blacks and whites is similar, some 80 percent of 
people on death row have been convicted of crimes against white victims.<b>26</b> Interlocutors pointed 
to the critical situation in some states. In Alabama, for example, whereas 65 percent of all 
murders involve black victims, 80 percent of people currently awaiting execution in the state 
were convicted of crimes in which the victims were white.

</p>
<p>51. Juvenile justice was an issue of concern for civil society organizations, particularly when it 
represents an entry point into criminal justice (see subsection III.C). The rate of detention of 
youth in 2003 was five times higher for African Americans and two times higher for Hispanics 
than for whites.<b>27</b> The Special Rapporteur was also presented with data concerning the 
disproportional representation of African American youth in several stages of the juvenile justice 
process, including arrests, detentions, petitions and prison.<b>28</b> Reference was made to the issue of 
sentencing of youth to life without parole, which is applied in 39 states, as well as on reported 
racial bias in these practices, particularly in certain states. In the 25 states for which data is 
available the rate of African Americans serving life without parole sentences is on average 10 
times higher than whites, relative to the state population. In California, the rate is 18 times that of 
white youth. Even after controlling for differences in murder arrest rates, racial disparities 
remain.<b> 29</b> 
</p>
<p><i>Racial profiling 
</i>52. Civil society generally refers to two main forms of racial profiling. First, a particular form 
of the practice targets predominantly African-American or Hispanic minorities, generally but not 
exclusively in stops and searches by local and state police.<b>30</b> Second, in the context of counter-
terrorism policies, racial profiling practices have reportedly targeted primarily people of Arab, 
Muslim, South Asian or Middle-Eastern descent, particularly in air travel and border control.  
</p>
<p>53. Some civil society accounts point to widespread existence of racial profiling. It has been 
suggested that approximately 32 million people in the United States report having been victims 
of this practice.<b>31</b> While exact numbers may be difficult to assert, it was a common recognition 
among virtually all interlocutors that the practice of racial profiling continues to exist. Numerous

<p>anecdotal accounts of victims of racial profiling in stop and search operations by the police 
were heard, including a testimony by an African American Member of Congress victim of such 
an incident. 
</p>
<p>54. Several organizations expressed concern at the National Special Entry-Exit Registration 
Program (NSEERS), put in place in 2002. The special registration program required male 
non-citizens over the age of 16 and from 25 countries to register with local immigration 
authorities. Twenty-four of these countries have a majority Muslim population.<b>32</b> While the 
initial requirements of re-registration after 30-days and one year of continuous presence in the 
United States have been suspended,<b>33</b> the program continues to be considered by civil society as 
discriminatory on the basis of national origin and religious background. 
</p>
<p>55. Civil society organizations expressed criticisms regarding recent attempts to address the 
issue. The <i>Guidance Regarding the Use of Race by Federal Law Enforcement Agencies</i> issued 
by the Department of Justice was criticized, particular because it &#8220;does not cover profiling based 
on religion, religious appearance or national origin; does not apply to local law enforcement 
agencies; does not include any enforcement mechanism; does not require data collection; does 
not specify any punishment for federal officers who disregard it; contains a blanket exception for 
cases of &#8216;threat to national security and other catastrophic events&#8217; and &#8216;in enforcing laws and 
protecting the integrity of the Nations&#8217; borders&#8217;&#8221;.<b>34</b>  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Hate crimes 
</b></p>
<p>56. Interlocutors highlighted that the main weakness of federal hate crimes legislation is the 
dual requirement that needs to be met for the Federal Government to be able to investigate and 
prosecute a case: bias-motivated violence and relation to a federally protected activity. In cases 
that do not meet these requirements, the jurisdiction lies at the state level. However, many states 
lack the capacity and resources to thoroughly investigate and prosecute such crimes. In this 
regard, a Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act designed to strengthen the role of 
the Federal Government in the investigation and prosecution of such crimes and to expand the 
grounds for protection was approved in the House of Representatives and the Senate in 2007. 
However, it was withdrawn after an expression by the White House that the President would 
veto the bill, which was seen as &#8220;unnecessary and constitutionally questionable&#8221;.<b>35</b>

</p>
<p>57. While many interlocutors expressed concern regarding the number of hate crimes in the 
United States, some NGOs highlighted that the government response has in general been more 
vigorous than in other countries.<b>36</b>  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Education 
</b></p>
<p><i>De facto school segregation 
</i>58. One of the most important decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court in the fight for racial 
equality was <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> prohibiting school segregation. However, 
interlocutors pointed out that despite the end of <i>de jure </i>segregation and positive changes, 
particularly in the 1960-1980 period, the trend has since been reversed. The percentage of black 
students in predominantly minority schools, which was 77 percent in 1968 and decreased to 
63 percent in 1988, had surged to 73 percent in 2005.<b>37</b> Civil society organizations expressed 
concern at recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions &#8211; <i>Parents Involved in Community Schools v. 
Seattle School District </i>and <i>Meredith v. Jefferson County Board of Directors </i>&#8211; that ruled that 
race-conscious integration measures are unconstitutional. In the view of many NGOs, these 
race-conscious measures are a necessary measure to ensure racial integration and made an 
essential contribution to de-segregation of schools, particularly in the South. Some organizations 
also pointed out that the rise of segregation also has an impact on the quality of education 
received by students belonging to minorities. Furthermore, a concern was expressed that the 
Court may have abandoned the notion that racial diversity can be considered a compelling 
interest that justifies the use of race-based criteria. This view is present in the dissenting opinion 
of Justice Breyer in the <i>Community Schools </i>case.<b>38</b> 
</p>
<p><i>Achievement gaps 
</i></p>
<p>59. Civil society representatives highlighted that while the achievement gap between students 
belonging to minorities and white students has narrowed in the past years, it is still in a similar 
level to 1990. The introduction of the No Child Left Behind Act placed high emphasis on 
educational performance; however, interlocutors highlighted the negative incentives created by 
the Act and its disproportionate effects on minority children. In particular, it was argued that the 
focus on standardized performance tests that penalize schools that underperform creates an 
incentive for schools to push out low-performing, at-risk students &#8211; a group that is composed 
disproportionately of minorities &#8211; in order to improve the overall school performance.

</p>
<p><i>Schools as an entry point to the criminal justice system 
</i>60. Many NGOs used the metaphor of the &#8220;school to prison pipeline&#8221; to refer to the failure of 
the school system to educate pupils adequately, serving rather as a conduit to juvenile and 
criminal justice.<b>39</b> Among the chief causes of this phenomenon, interlocutors referred to the 
widespread application of Zero Tolerance Policies, which call for severe punishment for minor 
infractions. These measures are considered to have gone beyond reasonable policies to prevent 
violence in school, leading to what is considered to be an overreliance on disciplinary methods 
(e.g. suspensions and expulsions) and the criminalization of school misbehaviour (i.e. by 
referring students with non-violent behaviour to juvenile courts). In Texas, for example, 
&#8220;disruptive behaviour&#8221; corresponds to 17 percent of school arrests and &#8220;disorderly conduct&#8221; 
comprised 26 percent of such arrests.<b>40</b> In meetings with parents of students that were 
disciplined, the Special Rapporteur was informed of several practices that exist in some school 
districts, such as the issuing of fines by the police to students with inappropriate behaviour, 
regular searches and reported cases of excessive use of force by police officers inside schools. 
Civil society pointed to racial disparities in the application of these disciplinary measures. For 
example, whereas African-American children represent only 17 percent of public school 
enrolment, they constitute 32 percent of out-of-school suspensions.<b>41</b> Some studies have also 
indicated that African-American students are more likely than white students to be suspended, 
expelled or arrested for the same kind of school conduct.<b>42</b>  
</p>
<p><b>D.  Housing 
</b></p>
<p>61. Concerns about fair housing expressed by civil society generally focus on two major 
issues: direct discriminatory practices and structural factors that have an impact, even if 
unintended, on the housing situation of minorities. 
</p>
<p>62. According to interlocutors, direct discriminatory practices in housing continue to exist. 
Data produced in paired testing, which allows for a comparison of treatment between whites and 
persons of color when they have similar qualifications, identified subtle forms of direct 
discrimination. This includes the practice of &#8220;steering&#8221; members of racial or ethnic groups 
towards neighbourhoods primarily occupied by those same groups, prohibited under the Fair

<p>Housing Act.<b>43</b> Steering practices have generally contributed to a persistence of residential 
segregation. Direct discrimination has also been detected in rental and sale of houses as well as 
in mortgage lending, with people of colour being more likely to receive higher cost or subprime 
loans than white borrowers with similar income and other characteristics.<b>44</b> 
</p>
<p>63. Concerns were expressed that the FHEO, which is the key agency responsible for acting on 
complaints of housing discrimination, only finds reasonable cause for discrimination in a small 
number of complaints and that the period of investigation is often surpasses the 100-day mark set 
by Congress.<b>45</b> It should be noted, however, that a number of cases are resolved through the 
conciliation and settlement processes which are encouraged under the Fair Housing Act. At the 
same time, enforcement actions by the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice were 
also criticized due to the limited number of cases it has initiated. Another problem raised by civil 
society is the large number of unreported cases of fair housing violations due to lack of 
knowledge of Fair Housing laws. While the Special Rapporteur was informed by HUD of many 
awareness-raising initiatives, civil society deemed them insufficient to educate the public.<b>46</b> 
</p>
<p>64. A particular dimension of the housing problem highlighted by civil society lies in 
homelessness. The Special Rapporteur visited the Skid Row area in Los Angeles, interacting 
with a number of homeless persons and civil society support groups. Interlocutors highlighted 
the disproportionate impact of homelessness among minorities, particular African Americans, as 
also highlighted by the Human Rights Committee in its 2006 of the United States periodic 
report.<b>47</b> This problem is often reinforced by the reduction of funds for the construction of public 
housing. In addition, relations between law enforcement and homeless persons were also 
highlighted as an important problem, particularly with regard to the enforcement of minor law 
enforcement violations which often take a disproportionately high number of African American 
homeless persons to the criminal justice system.

<p>65. The issue of residential segregation was directly observed by the Special Rapporteur, who 
examined the issue in-depth in his visits outside the capital. Despite some progresses in the 
1980-2000 period,<b>48</b> they contributed little to change the overall static patterns of residential 
segregation in the country. Furthermore, civil society noted that residential segregation has a 
direct impact on school segregation and that the two problems should be tackled together.  
</p>
<p><b>E.  Employment 
</b></p>
<p>66. Interlocutors stated that ethnic disparities in employment and, more generally, poverty 
levels have fundamental consequences for the overall situation of racial and ethnic minorities in 
the United States. Whereas the unemployment rate for non-Hispanic whites in 2007 was 
5.2 percent, it was 12.6 percent for American Indians or Alaskan Natives, 12 percent for 
African-Americans and 7.3 percent for Hispanics.<b>49</b> 
</p>
<p>67. While many interlocutors pointed these disparities in unemployment level as an indication 
of the interplay of race and socio-economic status, concerns over forms of direct and indirect 
discrimination in employment were also raised. One of the issues that was raised concerns the 
legal remedies available to undocumented migrants (see subsection III.h). Another issue of 
concern regards the lack of protection for certain occupations, particularly domestic and 
agricultural workers, which disproportionately affect Africa-Americans and Hispanics. In some 
cases, these occupations may be excluded from the legal protections offered by a number of 
statutes, such as minimum wages, overtime pay and job safety.  
68. Civil society organizations pointed to inadequate enforcement of Title VII of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, 
sex and national origin, highlighting a the limited number of Title VII cases filed by the Civil 
Rights Division of the Department of Justice. In particular, reference was made to the low 
percentage of cases referred to the Civil Rights Division by the EEOC that are actually taken up. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Discrimination in the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001 
</b></p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur met with several representatives of the Arab, Sikh, Middle Eastern 
and South Asian communities in the United States to hear their views concerning the situation 
after 9/11. Their common view was that their situation had deteriorated quickly in the aftermath 
of 9/11, particularly due to the extension of national security measures that in their view 
discriminate against these communities. One of the major concerns regards instances of racial 
profiling, particularly in airports, as well as programs such as NSEERS (see section III.A above).

<p>70. An increase in cases of discrimination and harassment in the workplace was also reported, 
not only towards people of Arab or Muslim descent, but also against Sikhs. Serious concern was 
expressed regarding the long delay in the processing of citizenship applications, which had been 
disproportionately high for individuals of Arab, Middle Eastern or South Asian descent.<b>50</b>  
</p>
<p>71. More broadly, these organizations referred to overall negative perceptions of the American 
public towards Muslims. Reference was made to a recent USA Today/Gallup poll that showed 
that 39 percent of Americans felt at least some prejudice against Muslims and that 22 percent 
would not want Muslims as neighbors.<b>51</b> While a number of organizations welcomed outreach 
initiatives developed by the Government in the aftermath of 9/11, they expressed the need for 
comprehensive actions to address issues of stereotyping and concrete policy changes in areas that 
have a discriminatory impact on individuals of Arab, Sikh, Middle Eastern and South Asian 
descent.  
</p>
<p><b>G.  Measures taken in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina 
</b></p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur travelled to New Orleans, as well as the Louisiana and Mississippi 
Gulf coast, in order to hear local civil society, community leaders and residents about their 
concerns in the aftermath of Katrina. In addition, he visited different neighborhoods that were 
severely affected by the storm, including the 9th Ward of New Orleans. He also met with the 
Mayor of New Orleans, with whom he discussed the reconstruction efforts and implications for 
minorities. 
</p>
<p>73. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau show the massive impact of Hurricane Katrina in the 
entire Gulf coast. In the State of Louisiana, 1.3 million people were displaced, with a dramatic 
depopulation of New Orleans as a whole.<b>52</b> However, data indicate the disproportionately high 
impact of Katrina for African-Americans. For example, whereas the population of whites in 
New Orleans decreased approximately 39 percent after Katrina, the population of 
Africa-Americans declined around 69 percent. The ethnic makeup of the city also changed: 
African-Americans formed around 67.3 percent of the population before Katrina and comprised 
only 58.8 percent after the hurricane.<b>53</b>

according to the Census, the white population of New Orleans was 135,956 and the 
African-American population was 325,947. In 2006, according to the American Community 
Survey, the white population was estimated at 82,107 and the African-America population 
at 131,441.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/36/Add.3

</p>
<p>74. Interlocutors in the Gulf coast, including displaced families, argued that the Federal 
Government is not fulfilling its obligation to create adequate conditions for the return of the 
displaced, particularly in terms of housing. Serious concerns were voiced regarding the 
demolition of public housing and substitution by private development projects. The demolition 
of public housing in New Orleans was deemed to have a particularly grave impact for the 
African-American population, which constitutes the vast majority of public housing residents.<b>54</b>  
75. Another issue of concern in the reconstruction phase is employment. According to 
interlocutors, the combination of the surge in unemployment rates after Katrina and the arrival of 
a large population of migrant workers, particularly of Hispanic origin, both documented and 
undocumented, have created a vulnerable environment where workers have been exposed to 
exploitation and substandard conditions of employment. Ethnic tensions emerged in this context 
between some African-American and Hispanic individuals, particularly in the context of low 
wages and stiffened competition for jobs. Attempts to instrumentalize and overstate these 
tensions were also made, particularly by certain local politicians.<b>55</b> 
</p>
<p>76. Interlocutors also mentioned  cases of excessive use of force by law enforcement officials 
and military personnel in the early days after Katrina; arbitrary detention of persons who 
attempted to evacuate the city; inadequate treatment of inmates, particularly in the Orleans 
Parish Prison; and allegations of racially discriminatory results of decisions by the Army Corp of 
Engineers to increase the height of the levies in predominantly white neighbourhoods. 
</p>
<p><b>H.  Immigration 
</b></p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur held a number of meetings with migrant workers across the 
country as well as civil society organizations working with migrant workers. In all of the 
meetings, migrant workers, particularly those who are undocumented, expressed serious 
concerns about their vulnerability and dire conditions.  
</p>
<p>78. The major issue raised was the disappointment with Congress&#8217; failure to approve the 
comprehensive immigration reform package put forward by the President. Migrant workers 
expressed the view that the regularization of their status would have represented improved 
protection and enforcement of their rights. This relates to their serious concern at the lack of 
legal protection they face, partly a result of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in <i>Hoffman Plastic 
Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB</i>, in which the Court ruled that the National Labour Relations Board 
did not have the authority to order that employers award back pay for work not performed to 
undocumented workers victims of unfair labour practices. This decision is allegedly being used 
by lower courts in cases that restrict the rights of undocumented workers in other domains, 
including access to justice.<b>56</b>

<p>79. Serious concern was expressed by several civil society organizations regarding worksite 
immigration enforcement by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials, particularly 
regarding allegations of the use of an individual&#8217;s appearance to determine which individuals in 
a worksite or community should be screened for immigration status. Concerns were also 
expressed regarding cooperation agreements between ICE and local law enforcement agencies 
that allow the latter to enforce immigration laws, which could have serious implications in 
generating distrust among communities and local police. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  ANALYSIS AND ASSESSMENT 
</b></p>
<p>80. Racism and racial discrimination have profoundly and lastingly marked and structured 
American society. The United States has made decisive progress in the political and legal combat 
against racism, through the resistance of communities of victims, the exemplary and powerful 
struggle of civil rights movements and the growing political confrontation of racism. However, 
the historical, cultural and human depth of racism still permeates all dimensions of life of 
American society.  
</p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur noted a strong awareness at all levels of government and society 
regarding the challenges in the fight against racism. He interprets this finding as a direct legacy 
of the continuous and determined struggle of the civil rights movement. In particular, he noted 
the recognition by authorities of the persistence of different manifestations of racism in the 
country and willingness to tackle this phenomenon. The Special Rapporteur considers awareness 
and open recognition of manifestations of racism as a precondition of any efforts to adequately 
tackle the problem. In particular, he commends the United States for the quantity and quality of 
information on issues related to his mandate, produced both by State institutions and civil 
society, and including racially- and ethnically-disaggregated data on demographic, social and 
cultural indicators. This information is essential for identifying trends and designing effective 
public policies. 
</p>
<p>82. The legacy of the civil rights movement is also reflected in the solid and comprehensive 
legal framework put in place in the country, particularly after the adoption of the Civil Rights 
Act of 1964 and extended in a variety of federal and local statutes and institutions. The Special 
Rapporteur would also like to note the central role played historically by the U.S. Supreme Court 
in the fight against racial discrimination, starting in <i>Brown v. Board of Education </i>and expanded 
thereafter. The legal and institutional frameworks are in any State the first lines of defence 
against racism, not only enforcing the obligation to equal treatment, but also giving victims 
access to remedies and, ultimately, to justice. 
83. The vitality of civil society is a third decisive element that contributes to the fight against 
racism. The Special Rapporteur was impressed with the quality of the work conducted by NGOs 
across the country, playing a key role in holding governments accountable to its obligation to 
enforce civil rights laws.

</p>
<p>that are <i>prima facie </i>non-discriminatory, but that have disparate effects for certain racial or ethnic 
groups; and problems that arise from the overlap of class, specifically poverty, and race or 
ethnicity. 
</p>
<p>86. Instances of direct discrimination and concrete racial bias still exist and are most 
pronounced with regards to law enforcement agencies. Despite the clear illegality of racial 
profiling under the fourteenth amendment, recent evidence shows practices that still prevail in 
law enforcement, such the disparity in the rate of arrests of minority and white drivers stopped 
by the police (see para. 52). In the educational system, evidence also shows racial bias in the 
type of disciplinary action given to white or minority students (see para. 64). In the justice 
system, evidence of racial bias in conviction rates and length of sentences of both juvenile and 
criminal courts exist (see paras. 50-55). In addition, programs such as NSEERS have clear ethnic 
or religious connotations (see para. 58). Direct discrimination was also found in many studies 
that used paired testing techniques, particularly in the areas of housing and employment. While 
these cases do not directly involve discrimination by state agents, strong enforcement of human 
rights is required. The Special Rapporteur notes that the right institutions are already in place to 
enforce existing laws, however, more robust efforts are required to increase the number of cases 
taken up every year, creating an important deterrent against future discrimination. 
</p>
<p>87. The Special Rapporteur also noted some laws and policies that are <i>prima facie 
</i>non-discriminatory but they have disparate effects for certain racial or ethnic groups. The key 
example of such practices is mandatory minimum sentences (see para. 53 above). While the 
Special Rapporteur welcomes the decision of the U.S. Sentencing Commission to revise the 
sentencing guidelines for crack cocaine offences, additional work needs to be done to review 
mandatory minimum sentences for crack cocaine, which disproportionately affect 
African-Americans. 
</p>
<p>88. Socio-economic indicators show that poverty and race or ethnicity continue to overlap in 
the United States. In 2007, whereas 9 percent of non-Hispanic whites were below the poverty 
level, 24.7 percent of African-Americans, 25.3 percent of American Indian and Alaskan Native 
and 20.7 percent of Hispanics were in that situation.<b>57</b> This reality is a direct legacy of the past, 
in particular slavery, segregation, the forcible resettlement of Native Americans, which was 
confronted by the United States during the civil rights movement. However, whereas the country 
managed to establish equal treatment and non-discrimination in its laws, it has yet to redress the 
socio-economic consequences of the historical legacy of racism. While noting some progress in 
this area, particularly in what concerns the representation and participation of racial and ethnic 
minorities in the high echelons of the political, economic and cultural arenas and the emergence 
of a middle class within minority groups, the Special Rapporteur underlines that much still needs 
to be done in this area. 
</p>
<p>89. The overlap between poverty and race in the United States creates structural problems that 
go far beyond patterns of income. Rather, it interacts with a number of mutually reinforcing 
factors, such as poor educational attainment, low-paying wages and inadequate housing, which 
create a vicious cycle of marginalization and exclusion of minorities. The overrepresentation of

</p>
<p>minorities in inferior schools, more vulnerable neighbourhoods, the juvenile justice system and 
the criminal justice system are to a large extent linked to their overall socio-economic situation. 
At the same time, these trends also contribute to reinforce prejudices and stereotypes, such as an 
association of minorities to criminality or to poor educational performance.  
</p>
<p>90. The consequences of the overlap of poverty and race were clearly seen in the aftermath of 
Hurricane Katrina. Minorities, as the poorest segments of the population, lived in more 
vulnerable neighbourhoods and were more exposed to the effects of the storm. It is thus not 
unexpected that these groups suffered from disproportional displacement or loss of their homes. 
Katrina therefore illustrates the pernicious effects of socio-economic marginalization and shows 
the need for a robust and targeted governmental response to ensure that racial disparities are 
addressed.  
</p>
<p>91. The Special Rapporteur also noted that the socio-economic marginalization of racial or 
ethnic minorities has become more acute due to what he perceived as a slow process of <i>de facto 
</i>re-segregation in many areas of the American society. In particular, in his visits to metropolitan 
areas, he noted the striking pattern of ethnic and racial cleavages that persist and which are being 
reinforced by processes such as gentrification in neighbourhoods historically inhabited by 
minorities. A related aspect is the process of re-segregation in public schools. Several studies 
have shown that the present level of segregation is similar to that of the late 1960s. These 
processes not only contribute to keep racial groups physically separated, but also affect the 
marginalization of public services in areas that are predominantly attended by minorities. 
Ultimately, this creates an obstacle in the most important means of promoting equality of 
opportunity, which is to offer quality education for all students. In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur is particularly concerned about the retraction of affirmative action policies, which 
make a tangible contribution to enhancing diversity and integration in schools. 
</p>
<p>  A/HRC/11/36/Add.3 
  page 27 
 
</p>
<p>constructs, prejudices and perceptions. To fight these manifestations, the only effective solution 
is to link the fight against racism to the deliberate politically conscious construction of a 
democratic, egalitarian and interactive multiculturalism. In his views, this is the most important 
problem the United States needs to face. A key notion in this regard is the need to promote 
interaction among different communities as an important means to create tolerance and mutual 
understanding, strengthening the social networks that hold a society together. Racial or ethnic 
communities in the United States still experience very little interaction with each other: 
racially-delimited neighbourhoods, schools and churches prevail. The promotion of more 
interaction among racial minorities is an essential step that needs to be taken to address the root 
causes of racism in the United States. 
</p>
<p>95. This notion of interactions among communities is also central to understand that the 
problem of racism in the United States is not solely that between a white majority and minorities, 
but also occurs among minorities themselves. In particular, many minority groups have been 
isolated, competing for jobs and social services. Apart from enforcing civil rights laws robustly, 
promoting more interaction among minorities themselves is an essential step in the fight against 
racism in the United States. 
</p>
<p>96. During the drafting of this report the United States elected President Barack Obama as its 
next Head of State. The Special Rapporteur would like to underscore the importance of this 
event in giving new visibility to minorities in the country. It further corroborates the view 
expressed in this report that the United States has made fundamental progress in the past decades 
in giving visibility to members of minorities in the political, economic and cultural arena. More 
significantly,  this election is the outer reflection of the slow but profound transformation  
process in the deeper layers of consciousness of every citizen of the United States from all racial 
and ethnic communities, in the individual  confrontation  to racism in all dimensions and 
instances of every day life. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Congress should establish a bipartisan Commission to evaluate the progress and 
failures in the fight against racism and the ongoing process of re-segregation, particularly 
in housing and education, and to find responses to check these trends. In this process, 
broad participation from civil society should be ensured.  
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The Government should reassess existing legislation on racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance in view of two main guidelines: addressing the 
overlapping nature of poverty and race or ethnicity; and linking the fight against racism to 
the construction of a democratic, egalitarian and interactive multiculturalism, in order to 
strengthen inter-community relations.  
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>The Federal Government, in particular the Civil Rights Division of the Department of 
Justice, the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission and the Office of Fair Housing 
and Equal Opportunity of the Department of Housing and Urban Development should 
intensify their efforts to enforce federal civil rights laws in their respective domains.  
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>Since the fight against racism needs to take place at the federal, state and local levels 
of government, the Special Rapporteur recommends that adequate consultation 
mechanisms be put in place for a coordinated approach at all levels of Government. </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/11/36/Add.3 
page 28 
 
</p>
<p>101.<b> As a matter of urgency, the Government should clarify to law enforcement officials 
the obligation of equal treatment and, in particular, the prohibition of racial profiling. This 
process would benefit from the adoption by Congress of the End Racial Profiling Act. State 
Governments should also adopt comprehensive legislation prohibiting racial profiling. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>To monitor trends regarding racial profiling and treatment of minorities by law 
enforcement, federal, state and local governments should collect and publicize data about 
police stops and searches as well as instances of police abuse. Independent oversight bodies 
should be established within police agencies, with real authority to investigate complaints 
of human rights violations in general and racism in particular. Adequate resources should 
also be provided to train police and other law enforcement officials. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>Mandatory minimum sentences should be reviewed to assess disproportionate impact 
on racial or ethnic minorities. In particular, the different minimum sentences for crack and 
powder cocaine should be reassessed.  
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>In order to diminish the impact of socio-economic marginalization of minorities in 
what concerns their access to justice, the Government should improve, including with 
adequate funding, the state of public defenders.  
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that complementary legislation be considered 
to further clarify the responsibility of law enforcement and criminal justice officials not 
only to protect human rights, but as key agents in the fight against racism.  
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>In view of the recent recommendations by the Human Rights Committee,58 the 
Committee Against Torture59 and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination,60 and considering that the use of life imprisonment without parole against
