<p><i>Summary 
</i> In the present report, the Special Rapporteur provides an in-depth analysis of the 
first decade of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially 
women and children, 2004&#8211;<footnote name="20">to 23 April 2009 </footnote>14. 
</p>
<p> Part I introduces the review. Part II provides a general overview of the mandate, the 
legal framework within which the mandate has operated and the working methods used. 
Part III introduces the overarching principles and themes that have guided and shaped the 
work of the mandate holders. Part IV outlines the major substantive areas of focus for the 
mandate over the decade of its existence. Part V summarizes key achievements of the anti-
trafficking movement that the Special Rapporteurs have guided and to which they have 
contributed. Part VI identifies the challenges that have confronted the mandate and the 
international community as a whole in seeking to develop effective, rights-based responses 
to trafficking. Part VII provides a forward&#8211;looking conclusion and recommendations 
outlining ways in which the mandate can continue and increase its contribution to the 
global movement against human trafficking. 
</p>
<p> The preparation of the report involved a desk review and analysis of relevant 
documentation produced throughout the 10 years of the mandate. It also reflects the 
insights of Member States and organizations with whom the mandate has worked and

<p>  Acknowledgments...................................................................................................  1&#8211;<footnote name="2">4. Country visits &#8211; both official missions and non-official visits - have been a critical 
aspect of the work of the mandate; helping to ground the mandate-holders&#8217; understanding 
of the problem of trafficking in national realities and forging important relationships with 
those on the front&#8211;line, while also providing involved States and their partners with an 
opportunity to access information, expertise and insight. Several respondents to the 
questionnaire including several States noted that official visits of the SRTIP had influenced 
shifts in policy and practice around trafficking, for example leading to changes in migration 
policies, amendments to the national trafficking law, and improved cooperation with civil 
society organizations. Others, including several international organizations, noted that the 
official missions provided a valuable opportunity for stakeholders to convey their views 
and insights to higher levels of Government than would otherwise be the case, and that the 
reports themselves were an excellent source of useful, high-quality information.

<p><b>  Acknowledgements 
</b></p>
<p>1. The mandate has received valuable support from a wide range of stakeholders and 
partners including States, UN agencies and international organizations, academic 
institutions, and non-governmental organizations. The Special Rapporteur on trafficking in 
persons, especially women and children, Joy Ngozi Ezeilo (hereafter SRTIP Ezeilo) is very 
grateful to all for all their important contributions in the form of expertise, research and 
other types of support. She appreciates the efforts of States to reply to questionnaires sent 
and their cooperation prior, during and after country visits throughout the years of existence 
of the mandate. A number of independent experts developed background papers and other 
materials in the context of the SRTIP&#8217;s thematic studies. In 2011, a Human Trafficking 
Research Panel was established at Oxford and Cambridge Universities to support the work 
of the mandate by providing assistance in background research and, since that time, has 
made a substantial contribution to the work of the SRTIP. Others providing substantive 
support include the International Human Rights Clinic at Duke University School of Law 
and the African Women&#8217;s Development Fund. SRTIP Ezeilo takes this opportunity to 
express her thanks to those mentioned and the many others who have provided the mandate 
with invaluable and much appreciated assistance over the past decade. 
</p>
<p>2. A word of appreciation must also go to the victims of trafficking who have so 
bravely and generously shared their stories and their experiences with the SRTIP. Their 
willingness to contribute, inform and advise has been critical to the mandate&#8217;s 
understanding of how trafficking happens and how it impacts on the rights and freedoms of 
individual women, men and children. SRTIP Ezeilo acknowledges the great contribution 
made by victims to the work of the mandate and expresses her sincere hope that their voices 
continue to guide and shape the mandate into the future. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>3. In December 2000, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Protocol to 
Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, 
supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime 
(Trafficking Protocol), the first international agreement on trafficking in persons since the 
adoption, in 1949, of the much more narrowly focused Convention for the Suppression of 
the Traffic in Persons and the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others. The adoption of the 
Protocol signalled a fundamental shift in the international approach to exploitation of 
individuals for private profit. In the years that followed other treaties on the subject were 
developed, along with a substantial body of soft law including the United Nations 
<i>Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking</i>.<footnote name="1">26
 CTOC/COP/2008/19, Decision 4/4 (at p. 11). </footnote> 
International and regional bodies, along with civil society groups became involved in 
researching trafficking and supporting anti-trafficking efforts. Most States began 
introducing new laws and policies aimed at criminalizing trafficking, protecting victims and 
preventing future trafficking. One State launched a unilateral monitoring mechanism that 
commenced reporting on and evaluating the response of other States to the phenomenon. 
All these developments set the stage for the international human rights system to take up 
the issue of trafficking in a way it had never done before. 
</p>
<p>4. At its sixtieth session in 2004, the predecessor to the Human Rights Council, the 
Commission on Human Rights, decided to appoint a Special Rapporteur on trafficking in 
</p>
<p>

<p>persons, especially women and children (SRTIP), whose mandate would focus on the 
human rights aspects of the victims of trafficking.2 The first Special Rapporteur was 
appointed on 8 October 2004. The central theme of the mandate was critical. Despite 
general acknowledgement of the human rights aspects of trafficking, the issue was widely 
considered by States to be principally one of migration, security and public order. The 
Trafficking Protocol, now the single most important international agreement on the subject, 
was not a human rights instrument, but rather one aimed squarely at preventing the spread 
of trafficking as a form of transnational organized crime. While the issue of trafficking had 
been on the agenda of the modern international human rights system since its inception, 
there was, in 2004, a very real danger that its core identity as a violation of the rights of the 
most vulnerable in society could be marginalized or lost. The establishment of the position 
of special rapporteur, with an explicit mandate to address the human rights aspects of 
trafficking, proved to be a critical circuit-breaker: affirming, on behalf of the international 
community two key principles: first, that the human rights of trafficked persons should be 
at the centre of all efforts to combat trafficking; and second, that anti-trafficking measures 
should not adversely affect the human rights and dignity of all persons concerned. 
</p>
<p>5. This review seeks to examine and reflect on the first decade of work of the SRTIP 
with particular attention to the two principles outlined above that have informed the 
mandate since its inception. The review is not exhaustive. Rather, it draws on the 
substantial body of documentation and research produced by the SRTIP to identify key 
achievements and on-going challenges within the context of global anti-trafficking efforts. 
In addition to providing a record of the work of the mandate the review is forward looking: 
seeking to identify lessons and insights for the future work of the mandate and the anti-
trafficking sector as a whole. 
</p>
<p>6. While initiated by SRTIP, Joy Ngozi Ezeilo (2008&#8211;present) (SRTIP Ezeilo), the 
review covers the entire duration of the mandate including the work of the first Special 
Rapporteur, Sigma Huda (2004&#8211;2007) (hereafter SRTIP Huda). Its preparation involved a 
desk review and analysis of relevant documentation produced by the two mandate holders 
including annual and thematic reports, country visits reports, communications sent to 
States, statements from the mandate holders, research and meeting reports. SRTIP Ezeilo 
also circulated a questionnaire to States and organizations with whom the mandate had 
worked with a view to soliciting their views on the achievements of the mandate and its 
future areas of work. Insights from replies received have been incorporated throughout the 
present document, most particularly parts V-VII. 
</p>
<p>7. This report is divided into seven parts. The present Part I introduces the review; Part 
II provides a general overview of the mandate, the legal framework within which the 
SRTIP has operated and the working methods used; Part III introduces the overarching 
principles and themes that have guided and shaped the work of the SRTIP; Part IV outlines 
the major substantive areas of focus for the mandate over the decade of its existence; Part V 
summarizes key achievements of the anti-trafficking movement that the SRTIP has guided 
and contributed to; Part VI identifies the challenges that have confronted the mandate and 
the international community as a whole in seeking to develop effective, rights-based 
responses to trafficking; Part VII looks to the future: outlining ways in which the mandate 
can continue and increase its contribution to the global movement against human 
exploitation. The Review includes two annexes. The first is a list of activities undertaken by 
the two mandate holders including consultations, country visits and official country 
missions. The second annex is a list of all official reports and other documents produced by 
the mandate. This tool allows the reader to identify reports and parts of reports where a

<p><b> II. Mandate, legal framework and working methods 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Mandate of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>8. The issue of trafficking in persons only properly arrived on the international agenda 
in the mid-1990s as information emerged about the cross-border exploitation of girls and 
young women in South East Asia and Eastern Europe. At that time there was no accepted 
definition of &#8220;trafficking&#8221;, no understanding that men and boys could also be victims; and 
no conception that the purposes of exploitation could be as varied as the potential for profit. 
By the late 1990s, the international community had commenced work on a new treaty on 
trafficking with a particular focus on organized criminal aspects that would eventually 
address these gaps. While not yet a major focus of the international human rights system 
during those years, the High Commissioner for Human Rights became involved in the 
issue, as did several of the human rights bodies, most prominently the Special Rapporteur 
on violence against women, its causes and consequences. A 2000 report of the Special 
Rapporteur provided detailed discussion of the legal, social and economic dimensions of 
trafficking and was instrumental in affirming, at that critical point, the central place of 
human rights in both understanding and responding to trafficking.3 
</p>
<p>9. On 19 April 2004 the United Nations Commission on Human Rights decided to 
create a Special Rapporteur &#8220;whose mandate will focus on the human rights aspects of the 
victims of trafficking in persons, especially women and children&#8221;.4 In the same decision, 
the Commission invited the Special Rapporteur to submit annual reports including 
recommendations on measures required to uphold and protect the human rights of the 
victims. The Special Rapporteur was further requested to respond effectively to reliable 
information on possible human rights violations with a view to protecting the human rights 
of actual or potential victims of trafficking and to cooperate fully with other relevant 
special rapporteurs, in particular the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, and to 
take full account of their contributions to the issue. The Commission also requested the 
Special Rapporteur to cooperate with relevant United Nations bodies, regional 
organizations and victims and their representatives.5 
</p>
<p>10. The resolution, under which SRTIP Huda was appointed, was for three years. In 
2008 the mandate was extended for a further three years in order to &#8220;promote the 
prevention of trafficking in persons in all its forms and the adoption of measures to uphold 
and protect the human rights of victims&#8221;.6 SRTIP Ezeilo was appointed based on this 
resolution. The resolution specifically requested the SRTIP to, inter alia, promote the 
effective application of relevant international norms and standards and to contribute to the 
further improvement of them; integrate a gender and age perspective throughout the work 
of the mandate; identify and share best practices as well as challenges and obstacles in 
order to uphold and protect the human rights of the victims and to identify protection gaps 
in this regard; emphasize practical solutions including through international cooperation;

<p>request, receive and exchange information on trafficking in persons from Governments, 
human rights bodies and others; and respond to reliable information on alleged human 
rights violations with a view to protecting the human rights of actual or potential victims of 
trafficking. The resolution made specific reference to the international instruments of most 
relevance to the mandate: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights; the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its Protocol on the Sale of 
Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography, and the Trafficking Protocol. 
</p>
<p>11. In 2011, the Human Rights Council decided to extend the mandate for a further three 
years enabling SRTIP Ezeilo to continue her work.7 In its resolution 17/1, the Council 
reiterated the relevant standards, principal areas of focus and working methods set out in its 
previous resolution, adding a request that the mandate: &#8220;[e]xamine the impact of anti-
trafficking measures on the human rights of victims of trafficking in persons with a view to 
proposing adequate responses to challenges arising in this regard and to avoid re-
victimization of victims of trafficking&#8221;.<footnote name="8">1
 See for example A/65/288 (2010), para. 42. </footnote> 
</p>
<p><b> B. Definition and scope of trafficking in persons 
</b></p>
<p>12. Although long the subject of international attention and even international legal 
regulation, trafficking in persons was not defined in international law until December 2000 
with the adoption of the Trafficking Protocol. That instrument defines trafficking in persons 
as constituting three elements: (i) an &#8220;action&#8221;, being recruitment, transportation, transfer, 
harbouring or receipt of persons; (ii) a &#8220;means&#8221; by which that action is achieved (threat or 
use of force or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or a 
position of vulnerability, and the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve 
consent of a person having control over another person); and (iii) a &#8220;purpose&#8221; (of the 
intended action / means): namely, exploitation.9 The definition makes clear that consent of 
the victim to the intended exploitation is irrelevant when any of the listed means have been 
used. All three elements must be present to constitute &#8220;trafficking in persons&#8221; in 
international law. The only exception is that when the victim is a child the &#8220;means&#8221; element 
is not part of the definition. In other words, trafficking in children is constituted by an &#8220;act&#8221; 
performed for an exploitative &#8220;purpose&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>13. Since the inception of the mandate, both mandate holders have consistently upheld 
the international legal definition of trafficking, affirming its central role in establishing the 
parameters of trafficking, and enabling responses to be developed with consistency and 
clarity.<footnote name="1">10
 CRC/GC/2005/6, paras. 50&#8211;53. </footnote>0 In this regard it should be noted that the definition is now well entrenched in 
international law, being reflected in all major legal and policy instruments developed after

 The full definition set out in article 3 of the Trafficking Protocol reads as follows: &#8220;Trafficking in 
</p>
<p>persons&#8221; shall mean the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by 
means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, 
of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or 
benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of 
exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or 
other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, 
servitude or the removal of organs.

<p>adoption of the Protocol,<footnote name="1">9
 See for example A/HRC/10/16 (2009), Section V. </footnote>1 and adopted, explicitly or implicitly, by all relevant United 
Nations organizations and agencies, as well as other intergovernmental organizations 
working on the issue. The overwhelming majority of States (reported in 2012 to be 134)12 
has criminalized trafficking in their national laws, generally conforming to the substance of 
the definition set out in the Trafficking Protocol. 
</p>
<p>14. The importance of an agreed definition trafficking cannot be overstated: most 
particularly in terms of facilitating common understanding of the nature of the problem and 
thereby laying the foundation for agreement around required solutions. Previously, 
&#8220;trafficking&#8221; was understood as referring simply and solely to the cross-border movement 
of vulnerable women and girls into exploitation through prostitution.13 In the final decade 
of the twentieth century, considerable confusion emerged between &#8220;trafficking&#8221; and what 
was later to be confirmed as &#8220;migrant smuggling&#8221; (the facilitation of illegal cross-border 
movement for profit). The definition set out in the Trafficking Protocol resolved many of 
the major issues and disagreements. First, it made clear that the concept of trafficking in 
international law does not refer only to the process by which an individual is moved into a 
situation of exploitation: it extends to include the maintenance of that person in such a 
situation. Accordingly, it is not just the recruiter, broker or transporter who can be 
identified as a trafficker, but also the individual or entity involved in initiating or sustaining 
the exploitation. Second, the definition affirmed that trafficking is much wider in scope 
than previously envisaged: that it can take place for a wide range of end purposes including, 
but not limited to, sexual exploitation; that it can involve as victims men and boys as well 
as women and girls; and that it can take place across borders or within a single country, 
including the victim&#8217;s own. The SRTIP has embraced this understanding of trafficking, 
affirming the scope of the mandate to include trafficking in children for sexual purposes, 
child labour, adoption and participation in armed conflict; trafficking in men for forced 
labour, organized crime and other exploitation; trafficking in women and girls for forced 
marriage, sexual exploitation and forced labour; and trafficking in persons for removal of 
organs.14 
</p>
<p><b> C. Legal framework around trafficking 
</b></p>
<p>15. The creation of the mandate of SRTIP coincided with a period during which the 
uncertain and incomplete legal framework around trafficking in persons was clarified and 
considerably extended. The adoption and widespread ratification of the Trafficking 
Protocol was the most significant development in this regard not just through its definition 
but also by establishing a wide range of obligations on States parties with respect to 
criminalizing trafficking, preventing future trafficking and providing at least minimal 
protections for victims. The Protocol proved to be both an impetus and framework for 
subsequent legal and policy developments that, taken together, have helped to very clearly 
establish the obligations of States in this important area. The SRTIP has regularly promoted

</p>
<p>the effective implementation of the Protocol and has encouraged those States who are not 
yet party, to accede to this important instrument. 
</p>
<p>16. Of course trafficking was a matter for international human rights law long before it 
became an issue of migration or of transnational organized crime. It is nevertheless true that 
apart from two solid references in the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, 
international human rights law does not contain a comprehensive prohibition on 
trafficking.15 The question of whether or not such a prohibition exists, or whether it can be 
inferred, or whether other prohibitions which do exist can be made to fit the trafficking 
phenomenon can only be answered with reference to myriad human rights instruments and 
standards dealing with issues as diverse as discrimination, slavery, torture, forced labour 
and violence against women, as well as the rights of particular groups including women, 
non-citizens, children migrants, refugees and persons with disabilities.16 The work of the 
SRTIP has affirmed the wide range of relevant standards and made very clear that 
trafficking is in fact an issue that cuts across much human rights terrain and therefore is (or 
should be) of concern to all parts of the international and regional human rights systems. 
17. The critical task of identifying the human rights &#8216;wrong&#8217; of trafficking as well as 
associated obligations and entitlements was greatly facilitated by the United Nations Office 
of the High Commissioner for Human Rights&#8217; <i>Recommended Principles and Guidelines on 
Human Rights and Human Trafficking</i> (OHCHR Principles and Guidelines) released in 
2002. In her report transmitting this document to the Economic and Social Council, the 
High Commissioner explained that the development of the OHCHR Principles and 
Guidelines was a direct response to the clear need for practical, rights-based policy 
guidance on the issue.17 From the very first report the SRTIP has affirmed the OHCHR 
Principles and Guidelines as an essential tool in the work of the mandate, most particularly 
in assessing particular issues and situations from the perspective of human rights, as well as 
in helping to facilitate the integration of a human rights perspective into national regional 
and international laws, policies and interventions. The core principles articulated in that 
instrument including the primacy of human rights; the responsibility of States to act with 
due diligence in preventing and responding to trafficking and protecting victims; and the 
need to ensure that anti-trafficking measures do not negatively affect the enjoyment of 
human rights and dignity of any person, have continued to be central to all aspects of the 
work of the mandate.18 Both incumbents have used the OHCHR Principles and Guidelines 
extensively in their work. SRTIP Ezeilo has regularly called on States to incorporate core 
provisions in their legal and policy framework around trafficking19 and has been

 The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (article 6) obliges

<p>States parties to take all appropriate legislative and other measures to suppress all forms of traffic in 
women and exploitation of the prostitution of women. The Convention on the Rights of the Child 
requires States parties to &#8220;take all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent 
the abduction of, the sale of or traffic in children for any purpose or in any form&#8221; (article 35). Other 
provisions relating to, inter alia, protection of children from economic exploitation (article 32) and 
sexual exploitation and sexual abuse (Article 34) are also relevant.

</p>
<p><b> D. Working methods 
</b></p>
<p>18. The general approach to the mandate has been guided by the relevant resolutions 
which require the SRTIP to: (i) seek and receive information from States, human rights 
bodies and other relevant sources and respond effectively to such information; (ii) 
recommend practical solutions with regard to implementation of relevant rights; (iii) 
examine the human rights impact of anti-trafficking measures with a view to proposing 
adequate responses; and (iv) work closely with other mechanisms of the Human Rights 
Council and the United Nations and other partners.21 In the discharge of the mandate the 
SRTIP has focused particularly on the working methods set out below. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Communication and engagement with stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>19. Trafficking in persons is a critical issue for every country, affecting many different 
groups and cutting across multiple areas of legal and illegal activity. The range of current 
and potential stakeholders is accordingly very wide. SRTIP Huda recognized this particular 
aspect of her work from the outset22 and made consistent efforts to extend her engagement 
beyond Governments and international agencies to include the full range of civil society 
organizations working on the issue, as well as those engaged in related areas such as the 
rights of migrants and violence against women. Sigma Huda&#8217;s participatory and 
collaborative approach was continued and extended by Ezeilo who declared an intention to 
&#8220;reach out, listen, learn and share good practice around the world.&#8221;23 Ezeilo put this 
commitment in practice by instituting a system of regular, broad-based regional 
consultations aimed at securing expert input into her work while improving understanding 
of the mandate amongst key interlocutors. 
</p>
<p>20. The SRTIP has also engaged directly and consistently with international, regional 
and sub-regional bodies working on trafficking issues, most particularly the United Nations 
Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in 
Europe, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), the International Organization for 
Migration, the International Labour Organization, the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees and the International Committee of the Red Cross, as well regional bodies 
including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the African 
Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. Further, SRTIP Ezeilo has undertaken joint 
initiatives with related mandate holders. This included a strategic meeting in 2009 with the 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women and the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of slavery including its causes and consequences aimed at 
strengthening collective impact while avoiding unproductive duplication. That important 
discussion also involved stakeholders from key international organizations and civil 
society. It resulted in improved understanding of the different mandates and a renewed 
commitment to implement the Human Rights Council direction that related mandates to 
cooperate and coordinate their work.

</p>
<p>21. In the course of her work SRTIP Ezeilo has also actively solicited input from the 
private sector and from those persons and institutions with particular expertise. In relation 
to specialist subjects such as trafficking in persons for the removal of organs, the SRTIP 
brought in external expertise, in this case from the medical and transplant communities, in 
an effort to ensure accuracy of her reporting and the practical relevance of her 
recommendations as well as to improve understanding among relevant stakeholders. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Communication with victims of trafficking 
</b></p>
<p>22. The mandate of the SRTIP is squarely focused on the rights and needs of victims of 
trafficking and it is appropriate that victims are consulted and involved in the work of the 
mandate. SRTIP Ezeilo has paid particular attention to developing this aspect of the 
working methods. She has participated in panel discussions involving survivors of 
trafficking (New York 2009; Geneva 2009) and has actively sought to include the voices of 
victims in her studies and reports. SRTIP Ezeilo is convinced that victim involvement is 
critical to ensuring that measures taken to address trafficking benefit those in need; that 
unintended harmful consequences are anticipated and avoided; and that opportunities for 
change and improvement are identified in a timely way. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Thematic studies and reports 
</b></p>
<p>23. Thematic studies have been a major focus of the SRTIP&#8217;s work: enabling the 
mandate to make substantial and, according to responses to the questionnaire, highly 
appreciated contributions to poorly understood or new areas of concern. Topics for study 
have been carefully chosen on the basis of their relative importance and urgency as well as 
the SRTIP&#8217;s expected capacity to make a contribution to shaping international standards 
and promoting awareness in the chosen area. Issues covered in this way were: measures to 
discourage demand (2006 and 2013); trafficking for forced marriage (2007); victim 
identification, protection and assistance (2009); regional and sub-regional cooperation in 
promoting a human-rights-based approach to trafficking (2010); prevention of trafficking 
(2010); the right to an effective remedy for trafficked persons (2011); the administration of 
criminal justice in the cases of trafficked persons (2012); trafficking in supply chains 
(2012); and trafficking in persons for the removal of organs (2013). In accordance with the 
mandate issued by the Human Rights Council, particular emphasis has been placed on 
developing practical solutions to the issues under consideration. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Country visits and reports 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>consultative, involving Government officials (including practitioners); victim support 
agencies (and, where appropriate also victims); members of the judiciary and 
parliamentarians, United Nations country offices and other international and non-
governmental organizations based in the country as well and local civil society 
organizations. Each official country visit concludes with a press conference at which the 
SRTIP presents initial findings and recommendations. A detailed report is subsequently 
issued. The reports have evolved to generally follow a format that tracks the major issues of 
concern to the mandate: forms and manifestations of trafficking; legislative and institutional 
framework; identification of trafficked persons; protection of trafficked persons; 
prosecution of perpetrators; cooperation with civil society; and international and regional 
cooperation. In the10 years since the mandate was created a total of 21 official country 
missions have been undertaken. SRTIP Huda carried out five of those between 2005 and 
2006 to Bosnia-Herzegovina and Lebanon (2005); Bahrain, Oman and Qatar (2006). SRTIP 
Ezeilo undertook 16 of those missions between 2009- 2014 to Belarus, Poland and Japan 
(2009); Egypt, Argentina and Uruguay (2010); Thailand and Australia (2011); the United 
Arab Emirates, Gabon, the Philippines (2012); Morocco, Italy, Bahamas and Belize (2013); 
and Seychelles (2014). A full list of country visit reports is provided in Annex 1. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Recommendations and checklists 
</b></p>
<p>26. The SRTIP has actively sought to promote normative clarity around trafficking and 
to help flesh out the substantive content of key rules and obligations where that is required. 
This work has been firmly based on existing international standards as recognized in the 
major human rights treaties as well as the specialist trafficking instruments. A major output 
through this method of work is a set of draft basic principles on the right to an effective 
remedy (2011) developed after extensive consultation with stakeholders in all regions, that 
seeks to bring clarity to the concept of the right to an effective remedy and provide factors 
to be taken into account when this right is applied to trafficked persons. Additional 
information on this initiative is provided in paragraph 54 below. The SRTIP has also 
created a draft checklist of indicators and benchmarks with which businesses can assess the 
risks of human trafficking in their supply chains (2012). The checklist was developed and 
revised through a series of consultations and is intended to build and complement existing 
initiatives including the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Action on communications and urgent appeals 
</b></p>
<p>27. The SRTIP is explicitly mandated to respond effectively to reliable allegations of 
human rights violations with a view to protecting the rights of actual or potential victims of 
trafficking. In accordance with established procedure the SRTIP communicates the case to 
the Government concerned requesting clarification and action, either through an allegation 
letter or through an urgent appeal where the alleged violation is time-sensitive and / or of a 
very grave nature.24 
</p>
<p>28. The SRTIP has regularly sent urgent appeals or letters of allegation to States asking 
for clarification of certain matters, reporting all communications sent and responses 
received to the Human Rights Council. Since the mandate was established a total of 99 
communications have been sent by the SRTIP (out of which 92 were sent jointly with other 
mandate holders) and a total of 54 responses were received. Communications were often 
sent jointly with other special procedures, including for example, the Special Rapporteur on

Rights Council, Human Rights Council Resolution 5/2. </p>

</p>
<p>violence against women; the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants; and the 
Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery. Urgent appeals have proved 
valuable in helping to identify trends that may require more systematic responses, for 
example apparent increases in child trafficking and widespread lack of effective remedies 
for victims of trafficking.25 The mandate holders have generally found that communications 
provide an important vehicle to remind States individually of their international legal 
obligations with respect to responding effectively to trafficking and ensuring that the rights 
of victims under their jurisdiction or control are protected and respected. They have also 
found that communications can be an important advocacy tool for civil society 
organizations and for victims. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Overarching principles and themes 
</b>29. In their performance of the mandate, the two mandate holders have affirmed a 
number of overarching principles and themes as central to all aspects of their work. These 
principles and themes draw both inspiration and substance from the international legal 
framework around trafficking and seek to reinforce the consensus that has developed 
around the scope of the problem and the direction of appropriate responses. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Strategic direction 
</b></p>
<p><b>  
</b></p>
<p>30. At the commencement of the mandate the &#8220;Three Ps&#8221;: Protection, Prosecution and 
Prevention were already well established as guideposts for the strategic organization of 
trafficking responses at the national, regional and international levels. These provided 
important guidance and structure to the mandate during its first several years. In 2009 
SRTIP Ezeilo proposed an expansion of this strategic vision to include eight more pillars: 
an additional two criminal justice focused &#8220;Ps&#8221; (Punishment of perpetrators and Promotion 
of international cooperation) as well as three victim-centred &#8220;Rs&#8221; (Redress, Rehabilitation 
and Reintegration); and three Cs (Capacity, Coordination and Cooperation).26 Together, 
these 11 pillars have supported the SRTIP in shaping and promoting a coherent and 
comprehensive vision of an effective and rights-based response to trafficking. 
</p>
<p><b> B. All forms of trafficking and all victims 
</b></p>
<p>31. As noted at paragraph 12 above, international understanding around the nature and 
scope of trafficking has expanded significantly in the past several decades. It is now widely 
accepted that women, men and children are trafficked and that the forms of trafficking are 
as varied as the potential for profit or other personal gain. This development is highly 
significant from the perspective of international law because it brings within the relevant 
legal framework a wide range of exploitative conduct, much of which has been poorly or 
selectively regulated at both national and international levels. 
</p>
<p>32. Both mandate holders have embraced this comprehensive understanding of 
trafficking. In her very first report, SRTIP Huda affirmed as applicable to the mandate the

</p>
<p>Trafficking In Persons, Especially Women and Children, 65th session of the General Assembly, Third 
Committee, Item 69(b), 25 October 2010, New York, p. 2. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>definition of trafficking set out in the Trafficking Protocol and identified that she would 
devote attention to trafficking &#8220;at all sites and for all purposes&#8221;.27 While forms of 
trafficking of particular relevance to women and children, including sexual exploitation and 
forced marriage, dominated the first mandate holder&#8217;s work, SRTIP Ezeilo has explicitly 
adopted a broader approach. In her first report SRTIP Ezeilo affirmed her understanding of 
the mandate to include trafficking in children for sexual purposes, child labour, adoption 
and participation in armed conflict; trafficking in men for forced labour and other 
exploitation; trafficking in women and girls for forced marriage, sexual exploitation and 
forced labour; and trafficking in persons for removal of organs.28 
</p>
<p>33. Throughout her work, the current SRTIP has ensured a comprehensive focus on all 
forms of trafficking, thus attending not only to the most well-known and well-researched 
forms of trafficking, such as trafficking for sexual exploitation, but also bringing into the 
spotlight less prominent and less well understood phenomena such as trafficking in persons 
for the removal of organs; internal trafficking; and trafficking into industries not commonly 
associated with such exploitation (e.g. fishing and agriculture and the service industries). 
The SRTIP has also sought to highlight the plight of all victims including &#8216;untraditional&#8217; 
victims such as men and &#8216;imperfect&#8217; victims such as those who appear to have consented to 
some aspect of their situation; and those who have committed criminal offences in the 
course of their trafficking experience. 
</p>
<p>34. The SRTIP has made particular effort to interrogate and, where appropriate, 
challenge gender stereotypes that are endemic in public perception and official discourse 
around who is trafficked and for what purpose. Most particularly she has highlighted the 
misperceptions that lead authorities to ignore the trafficking of men, resulting in 
identification failures as well as significant discrimination against male victims, particularly 
in terms of access to protection and assistance.29 
</p>
<p><b> C. Human rights-based approach 
</b></p>
<p>35. A human rights-based approach has been integral to the mandate since its inception 
in recognition of the fact that responses to trafficking have not always been grounded in the 
firm foundations provided by human rights. SRTIP Ezeilo has consistently maintained that 
prioritizing other concerns such as crime prevention and migration control over human 
rights distorts the nature of the problem and obscures the most important and effective 
solutions. The two fundamental principles of a human rights approach were set out by 
SRTIP Huda in her first report and continue to guide the work of the mandate: first, that the 
human rights of trafficked persons shall be at the centre of all efforts to combat trafficking 
and to protect, assist and provide redress to those affected by trafficking; and second, that 
anti-trafficking measures should not adversely affect the human rights and dignity of the 
persons concerned.30 
</p>
<p>36. For the mandate of the SRTIP a human rights-based approach is understood as a 
conceptual framework that is <i>normatively</i> based on international human rights standards 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>28
 A/HRC/10/16 (2009), para. 16. Note that the Human Rights Council has explicitly required the 
</p>
<p>SRTIP to address trafficking &#8220;in all its forms&#8221; (A/HRC/RES/8/12 (18 June 2008), para. 4(a)).

</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>and that is <i>operationally directed</i> to promoting and protecting human rights.31 Such an 
approach requires careful consideration of the ways in which human rights violations arise 
throughout the trafficking cycle, as well as of States&#8217; obligations under international human 
rights law. It seeks to both identify and redress the discriminatory practices and unjust 
distributions of power that underlie trafficking, that maintain impunity for traffickers, and 
that deny justice to victims of trafficking. 
37. As explained in the <i>Commentary to the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on 
Human Rights and Human Trafficking</i>, under a human rights-based approach, every aspect 
of the national, regional and international response to trafficking is anchored in the rights 
and obligations established by international human rights law. The key points that can be 
drawn from experiences in other areas include: as policies and programmes are formulated, 
their main objective should be to promote and protect rights; a human rights-based 
approach identifies <i>rights-holders</i> (for example trafficked persons, individuals at risk of 
being trafficked, individuals accused or convicted of trafficking-related offences), their 
entitlements and the corresponding <i>duty-bearers</i> (usually States) and their obligations. A 
human rights-based approach works towards strengthening the capacities of rights-holders 
to secure their rights and of duty-bearers to meet their obligations; and core principles and 
standards derived from international human rights law (such as equality and non-
discrimination, universality of all rights, and the rule of law) should guide all aspects of the 
response at all stages.32 
</p>
<p>38. Since its inception the mandate has affirmed a clear commitment to a rights-based 
approach33 and over the past six years SRTIP Ezeilo has actively sought to refine 
understanding of how such an approach can be operationalized to best effect.34 She has also 
sought to further develop the concept, for example by showing how consultation with those 
who will be or have been affected by potential anti-trafficking measures is essential to a 
human rights approach to trafficking.35 
</p>
<p><b> D. Child-centred approach 
</b></p>
<p>39. It is well established that the trafficking of children through abduction, sale and 
other means is a widespread criminal phenomenon affecting all regions and most countries. 
The mandate&#8217;s work has confirmed that children are trafficked for the purpose of sexual 
exploitation including prostitution and the production of pornography. They are trafficked 
for forced and exploitative labour on farms, in factories, on fishing boats, for forced 
begging and for domestic servitude in private homes. While much trafficking of children 
involves movement across international borders, many countries experience the 
phenomenon of internal trafficking of children. The OHCHR Principles and Guidelines 
explain clearly why a child-centred approach is so important and what it should entail: 
</p>
<p>40. <i>The particular physical, psychological and psychosocial harm suffered by trafficked 
children and their increased vulnerability to exploitation require that they be dealt with 
separately from adult trafficked persons in terms of laws, policies, programmes and 
interventions. The best interests of the child must be a primary consideration in all actions 
</i></p>
<p>  
</p>

<p><i>concerning trafficked children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare 
institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies. Child victims of 
trafficking should be provided with appropriate assistance and protection and full account 
should be taken of their special rights and needs</i>.36 
41. SRTIP Ezeilo has repeatedly emphasized that the needs of child victims of 
trafficking in terms of assistance, protection and support will often differ substantially from 
those of adults and has advocated for child-specific and child-centred measures in relation 
to identification, protection and assistance of children that are based on the principles and 
provisions of existing human rights law, most importantly the Convention of the Rights of 
the Child.37 
</p>
<p>42. Such an approach also involves listening and responding to the voices and views of 
children who have been or who are at risk of being trafficked.38 The mandate has also 
highlighted the risk that measures intend to benefit children may compromise their situation 
even further. A difficult but relevant example is provided by well-meaning attempts to 
boycott or ban goods made by exploited children that have resulted in mass layoffs of child 
workers without warning and without compensation.39 While there can be no doubt of the 
need to introduce legislation and other measures to protect vulnerable children from 
exploitation and abuse, it is essential to also strive for common standards between countries 
in order to ensure that exploiters &#8220;cannot simply move on, accompanied by the children 
they exploit, to take advantage of different laws and regulations in a neighbouring State&#8221;.40  
</p>
<p><b> E. Attention to causes and vulnerability factors 
</b></p>
<p>43. The mandate holders have been mindful that prevention of future trafficking must be 
based on a thorough and nuanced understanding of the root causes of this phenomenon 
including the factors that make some people more vulnerable than others to trafficking-
related exploitation. Such understanding also helps to guide more effective responses: for 
example by helping to identify persons and groups at risk and by shaping public and official 
understanding about how trafficking happens and why. Further, attention to underlying 
causes helps counteract the prevailing narrative in reporting on these issues, dominated by 
sensationalist stories about victims of trafficking, which, in the words of SRTIP Ezeilo, 
routinely overlook &#8220;the underlying social and economic factors that led to the violation of 
their human rights&#8221;.41 
</p>
<p>44. During the decade of the mandate, the mandate holders have consistently sought to 
identify those factors that contribute to increasing the vulnerability of an individual or a 
group to trafficking. The work of the mandate has revealed considerable consistency across 
all regions and all manifestations of trafficking with regard to such factors that include 
human rights violations associated with (i) poverty and inequality; (ii) migration; and (iii) 
discrimination including through gender-based violence. Critically, there is almost never a 
single &#8216;root cause&#8217;: as SRTIP Ezeilo noted in 2010, &#8220;it is the combination of multiple 
factors that may place certain individuals at a higher risk of being trafficked.&#8221;42 The SRTIP

<p>has maintained throughout that States have a legal obligation to work to prevent trafficking 
by addressing vulnerability. This obligation is part of international treaty law43 and has been 
regularly affirmed by the Human Rights Council and General Assembly44 as well as by the 
human rights treaty bodies.45 
</p>
<p><b> 1. In relation to poverty and inequality (of both income and opportunity) 
</b>45. It is essential to recognize that these factors operate to severely constrain the choices 
of individuals, thereby making them vulnerable to the coercion, deception and abuse of 
vulnerability that are the means by which traffickers establish and maintain control over 
their victims. The SRTIP has repeatedly recognized that poverty and inequality related to 
TIP often has a strong gender dimension: the failure to guarantee women&#8217;s basic economic 
and social rights contributes to their vulnerability to sexual and economic exploitation.46 
While a ready solution to these problems is often unavailable, the SRTIP has emphasized 
the responsibility of States in this regard: to protect and uphold the rights of their citizens 
and persons within their jurisdiction, and to do all that is possible to address the poverty, 
inequality, lack of opportunity, discrimination, conflict and insecurity, that enable 
trafficking to thrive.47 
</p>
<p><b> 2. In relation to migration 
</b></p>
<p>46. The mandate has affirmed that while internal trafficking is a significant problem in a 
number of countries, much trafficking-related exploitation is directed towards migrants 
whose vulnerability is often exacerbated by social and linguistic isolation, lack of rights and 
irregular legal status. SRTIP Ezeilo has often noted the link between migration and 
violations of human rights: &#8220;[i]n many cases, people decide to leave home not as a matter of 
choice but as a matter of survival in order to escape from serious violations of their human 
rights&#8221;.48 She has regularly expressed concern over the legal and social discrimination faced 
by migrants in countries of destination, highlighting the contradictions inherent in the 
rapidly growing demand for low cost, low-skilled migrant labour on the one hand, and the 
persistent failure to recognize and protect the rights of these persons on the other.49 SRTIP 
Ezeilo has also raised concerns over increasingly restrictive immigration practices 
including criminalization and detention of irregular migrants that rarely achieve their 
purpose and contribute to an increase in exploitative migration including through 
trafficking.50 
</p>
<p><b> 3. In relation to discrimination including gender-based violence 
</b></p>
<p>47. The work of the SRTIP has affirmed that discrimination results in fewer and poorer 
life choices for people, rendering them more vulnerable to trafficking than those who have

<p>not suffered such discrimination. In the context of her country missions the previous51 and 
current SRTIP have expressed the view that widely held attitudes of racial and ethnic 
discrimination, which intersect with persistent patterns of gender discrimination, enhance 
demand for exploitation and trafficking since they make it socially more acceptable to 
exploit women and men from Africa, Asia or the poorest parts of Europe.52. SRTIP Ezeilo 
notes that violence directed against or primarily affecting women can be an important factor 
increasing vulnerability to trafficking. For example, women may accept dangerous 
migration arrangements in order to escape family or community violence. In some cases, 
unsafe migration may in fact be a better option than remaining in a situation of violence and 
abuse. Indeed, the violence suffered by women through trafficking is often &#8220;an extension of 
the violence suffered by some women at home.&#8221;53 In repeatedly highlighting the link 
between gender-based discrimination and violence and vulnerability to trafficking, the 
SRTIP has sought to alert States to their international legal obligation to protect women and 
girls from such violence including through legislation against practices such as domestic 
violence and to respond effectively when it does occur.54 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Major areas of focus and concern 
</b>48. Both SRTIP mandate holders have taken a strongly thematic approach to their work: 
actively seeking to identify cross-cutting concerns as well as aspects and manifestations 
that are of high relevance to all States and have not yet been subject to detailed 
consideration. This is especially appropriate given that trafficking, as now understood, is a 
new issue for many Governments and for the international community as a whole. The 
present section has identified six areas of the SRTIP&#8217;s work that have emerged as major 
themes of importance to the anti-trafficking movement as a whole. Some of these have been 
regularly considered throughout the mandate in the context of annual reporting and / or 
country visits. Others have been subject to separate, detailed consideration. It should be 
noted that the breadth of the SRTIP&#8217;s work is considerable and the section does not include 
all substantive areas dealt with by the mandate holders. 
</p>
<p><b> A. The rights of victims to assistance, protection and support 
</b></p>
<p>49. In line with the rights-based and victim-centred approach taken throughout the 
mandate, both mandate holders have focused strongly on elaborating the legal dimensions 
of the right of victims to assistance, protection and support, and in considering the extent to 
which these rights are respected and protected in practice. The considerable progress that 
has been made over the past decade in articulating State obligations to victims has greatly 
facilitated this process. It is now abundantly clear that States are indeed required to provide 
immediate assistance and support to victims of trafficking within their jurisdiction, and to 
protect them from further harm.55 The provision of immediate assistance, protection and 
support should not be conditional on the capacity or willingness of the victim to cooperate 
with criminal justice agencies. In 2009 SRTIP Ezeilo devoted a thematic report to the issue

<p>of victim identification, protection and assistance, affirming the key responsibilities of 
States in this regard and identifying ways in which these obligations can be effectively met 
in practice.56 
</p>
<p>50. In their country visits both mandate holders have noted a high level of discrepancy 
between rights in theory and rights in practice. Many States acknowledge their obligation to 
assist and protect victims but progress towards effective realization is often very slow. For 
example, whilst many Governments have set up shelters for trafficking victims, the quality 
of care is often inadequate. Shelters are often lacking in resources and expertise, leading to 
poor care, including inadequate psychological and legal support.57 In some countries, 
victims are detained in shelters for long periods, a situation SRTIP Ezeilo has identified as 
a major failure of protection.58 Other issues that have been regularly raised by SRTIP Ezeilo 
are set out below. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Victim identification 
</b></p>
<p>51. Victim identification is fundamental to realization of victim rights. By not 
identifying victims swiftly and accurately States effectively and permanently deny victims 
the rights to which they are legally entitled.59 The SRTIP has repeatedly affirmed the 
obligation on States to swiftly and accurately to identify victims of trafficking which, in 
addition to being an obligation in its own right, is an integral part of the procedural rights to 
effective remedies. Both mandate holders have drawn attention to the failure of criminal 
justice systems to identify trafficking victims, who instead are often arrested, detained, 
charged and prosecuted for entering and working irregularly, or engaging in prostitution.60 
As noted by SRTIP Ezeilo, &#8220;victims are simply treated as criminals and are arrested and 
deported with no opportunity to be identified and provided with the necessary assistance as 
trafficked victim&#8221;.61 Both mandate holders have advocated for more thorough and 
collaborative approaches to victim identification. SRTIP Ezeilo has repeatedly encouraged 
greater cooperation between victim support agencies and front line officers,62 as well as 
better use of existing resources for victim identification, noting that &#8220;although some very 
good work has been done by major stakeholders to combat trafficking by setting out criteria 
for identification &#8230; there is still ambiguity with regard to the criteria being used by many 
countries.&#8221;63 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Trafficked men 
</b></p>
<p>52. SRTIP Ezeilo has regularly raised concerns about the lack of appropriate assistance 
to men and boys who have been trafficked.64 Low identification rates are a widespread

<p>problem. Many States have been slow to recognize trafficking in men, a situation that is 
explained, at least in part, by the continuing strong focus on trafficking for sexual 
exploitation at the expense of trafficking for labour exploitation. For cultural and other 
reasons, male victims of trafficking are often reluctant to self-identify. Even where victim 
support assistance is available it may be inaccessible or not properly adapted for them and 
declined for those reasons. The work of the SRTIP in exposing this problem has hopefully 
prompted some reflection on why male victims are falling between the cracks and what can 
be done to ensure they are identified quickly and accurately and receive the support and 
assistance to which they are entitled. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. No prosecution or punishment 
</b></p>
<p>53. A significant development during the life of this mandate has been the growing 
acceptance that victims of trafficking should not be punished &#8211; or indeed prosecuted &#8211; for 
offences that have been committed in the course of their trafficking such as immigration 
and work offences. SRTIP Ezeilo has regularly upheld the importance of this principle65 
and endorses the now widespread position that States should not prosecute or punish 
victims &#8220;for unlawful acts committed by them as a direct consequence of their situation as 
trafficked persons or where they were compelled to commit such unlawful acts.&#8221;66 The 
SRTIP is of the view that this principle is an expression of basic principles recognized in 
most national legal systems relating to criminal responsibility. It does not confer blanket 
immunity but should operate to protect victims from acts committed under duress. A 
number of States, international organizations and civil society groups responding to the 
questionnaire pointed to the SRTIP&#8217;s work on this issue as a major achievement: helping to 
establish non-prosecution and non-punishment as an accepted standard. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The rights of victims to remedies 
</b></p>
<p>54. From the inception of the mandate, both SRTIPs have clearly affirmed the right of 
victims of trafficking to access remedies for the harms committed against them.67 In 
country reports both mandate holders have consistently examined the extent to which this 
right is protected by law and realized in practice. Such examination has generally revealed 
that trafficked persons are frequently left without remedies or the support necessary to 
access them, a situation that exacerbates the risk of further human rights violations 
including through re-trafficking. It was on the basis of insights gained through her country 
visits as well as information received through other activities, including her assessment of 
regional response mechanisms,68 that SRTIP Ezeilo decided to make effective remedies for 
victims the subject of more systematic and detailed attention. To that end she organized an 
expert consultation in 2010 that was followed by an on-line discussion forum and an 
interactive dialogue at the Human Rights Council in the context of her thematic report on

<p>the subject.69 Regional consultations were held during 2013 and early 2014 to disseminate, 
discuss and finalize the SRTIP&#8217;s draft basic principles on the right to an effective remedy 
for trafficked persons.70 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Applicable legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>55. One of the main purposes of the SRTIP&#8217;s work on effective remedies for victims has 
been to help clarify the relevant legal framework and by so doing, to provide guidance to 
practitioners and help address the substantial gap between the provisions of international 
law in this area and what happens in practice. In her report to the General Assembly on the 
issue, the SRTIP referred to the established legal doctrine requiring a State to remedy a 
wrong where an act or omission is attributable to that State and constitutes a breach of that 
State&#8217;s obligations.71 While States are not usually the direct source of trafficking-related 
harm, they may not absolve themselves of legal responsibility on this basis. That is because 
the legal framework around this issue requires States to take positive measures to the 
required standard of &#8216;due diligence&#8217; to prevent trafficking, protect victims and respond 
effectively. Failure to meet these obligations constitutes an internationally wrongful act for 
which the State is required to provide a remedy. International human rights law 
independently requires States to provide a remedy to victims of human rights violations. 
The obligation to provide remedies &#8211; or at least access to remedies &#8211; to victims of 
trafficking is set out in a number of relevant instruments72 and has been widely recognized 
by United Nations bodies73 and regional courts.74 Its essence is captured in Principle 1 of 
the draft basic principles on the right to an effective remedy for trafficked persons: 
&#8220;<i>Trafficked persons as victims of human rights violations have the right to an effective 
remedy for harms committed against them</i>.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Substantive components of the right to a remedy 
</b></p>
<p>56. SRTIP Ezeilo has recognized four substantive components of the right to a remedy 
that are applicable in cases of trafficking in persons, captured in Principle 4 of her draft 
basic principles: <i>In substance,</i> <i>trafficked persons should be provided with adequate 
reparations for the harms suffered, which may include restitution, compensation, recovery, 
satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition</i>. The first of these components, <i>restitution</i>, 
aims to restore the situation that existed prior to the violation. In the case of victims of 
trafficking the SRTIP has highlighted the importance of applying this in a way that is 
victim-centred and rights-aware. For example returning victims to their pre-trafficking 
situation may risk their wellbeing and expose them to re-trafficking. <i>Recovery</i> is a crucial 
form of reparation for trafficked persons and will likely include medical and psychological 
care as well as legal and social services. Once again, a rights-based and victim-centred 
approach will be required to ensure that recovery measures are provided in an appropriate

<p>and non-discriminatory way. <i>Compensation</i> is of critical importance to victims of 
trafficking who are likely to have suffered significant harm and lost valuable opportunities. 
Compensation can be awarded to victims via legal proceedings that may be civil or 
criminal. It can also be delivered through State-administered compensation funds or 
through non-judicial methods such as those operating between employers and employees in 
respect of wage disputes and work related injury compensation. <i>Satisfaction and 
guarantees of non-repetition</i> are important non-financial forms of reparation designed to 
compensate moral damage or damage to the dignity or reputation of the victim. In 
trafficking cases this form of remedy might be secured through a fair trial that recognizes 
the harm done to victims and imposes sanctions on perpetrators. Measures to prevent future 
trafficking are an important aspect of the guarantee of non-repetition. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Procedural components of the right to a remedy 
</b></p>
<p>57. SRTIP Ezeilo has come to appreciate that certain pre-conditions must be fulfilled if 
the right to a remedy for victims of trafficking is to be realized in practice. For example, 
failure to identify victims in the first place will inevitably operate to deny those persons 
access to remedies. In too many countries trafficked persons &#8211; including those who have 
been identified as such &#8211; are detained or deported without being given any opportunities to 
claim compensation. Sometimes there are legal impediments to foreign victims being able 
to access remedies. Improvements in identification procedures; the institution of a 
&#8220;reflection and recovery period&#8221; during which time victims can receive legal and other 
assistance; and review of any legal obstacles to access are therefore critical to effective 
realization of the right to a remedy. Of course, trafficked persons can only seek remedies if 
they are aware of their entitlements and how these can be exercised. It is essential that full 
and accurate information be made available to victims in a language and form they are able 
to understand. Further, victims should be provided with the necessary support and 
assistance that enables them to establish their entitlements, make informed and guided 
choices about remedies and navigate the often complex judicial and administrative 
machinery. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. The Draft basic principles on the right an effective remedy for trafficked persons 
</b></p>
<p>58. As noted above, SRTIP Ezeilo has overseen the collaborative and consultative 
development of a set of basic principles on the right to a remedy for victims of trafficking.75 
The Principles are firmly based on established rules of international law and are informed 
by an understanding of the legal and practical obstacles that have so far prevented progress 
in relation to remedies for victims of trafficking. The SRTIP recommends the Draft Basic 
Principles to States, intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, 
criminal justice agencies and others who may be in a position to contribute to the 
realization of the right of all victims of trafficking to remedies for the harms committed 
against them. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Human rights in the criminal justice response 
</b>59. SRTIP Ezeilo has noted an important shift in attitudes to the criminal justice aspects 
of the trafficking response over the life of the mandate. The development of a new 
international legal instrument on trafficking within a crime control framework raised 
understandable concerns that this focus would diminish attention and commitment to the 
human rights of victims. Put simply it was felt &#8211; and sometimes is still felt &#8211; that a strong

<p> 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>24</b> 
</p>
<p>criminal justice response to trafficking may conflict with a rights-based, victim-centred 
response. While accepting the very real dangers that an overwhelming focus on 
investigations and prosecutions may take attention away from the rights and needs of 
victims, SRTIP Ezeilo has come to understand that a strong criminal justice response is an 
integral part of dealing with trafficking effectively. In short, there should not be a conflict 
between victim rights and criminal justice responses, provided the latter explicitly sets out 
to both to challenge the culture of impunity enjoyed by traffickers and secure justice for 
victims. 
</p>
<p>60. Unfortunately the work of the mandate has confirmed that criminal justice responses 
to trafficking are highly problematic in many countries, often from the perspective of the 
alleged perpetrator as well as the victim. External and internal pressure to increase 
prosecution rates has had a particularly deleterious effect on underdeveloped criminal 
justice systems that have often been unable to deliver a fair trial and a just outcome. This 
damages the credibility of the criminal justice response and the agencies concerned. Such 
pressures have also encouraged poorly planned raids and &#8216;sweeps&#8217; that tend to deliver very 
little to persons who have been trafficked and may in fact harm the rights and interests of 
those caught up in such operations. Many victims are understandably reluctant to cooperate 
in the prosecution of their exploiters and may be coerced into doing so through the 
withholding of much needed support or threats of arrest and detention. Too often they are 
treated as instruments of criminal investigations, rather than as rights-holders with a legal 
entitlement to protection, support and remedies. Unfortunately, victims themselves are 
sometimes prosecuted often for offences that were committed under duress as part of the 
trafficking process In her 2009 report to the General Assembly, SRTIP Ezeilo affirmed her 
position that: &#8220;[a]dministration of justice systems must be geared towards guaranteeing 
access to justice to victims, providing effective remedy, promoting respect for the 
fundamental human rights of victims, including offenders, and ensuring adequate protection 
and assistance to victims of trafficking in order to prevent revictimization and avoid the 
danger of being retrafficked.&#8221;76 
</p>
<p>61. In 2011, In recognition of the very pressing problems associated with criminal 
justice responses and the lack of available guidance, SRTIP Ezeilo undertook a thematic 
study of rights-based approaches to the administration of criminal justice. The study 
involved commissioning of a background paper, distribution of a detailed questionnaire to 
United Nations Member States, and convening of a group of expert practitioners. The 
resulting report77 affirmed the obligation on States to criminalize trafficking; investigate 
and prosecute trafficking with due diligence; and to provide for appropriate penalties. It 
also highlighted the obligations on States to identify victims quickly and accurately and 
provide them with protection and support; to avoid the criminalization of victims; facilitate 
their safe and productive involvement in the criminal justice process; and promote 
cooperation between criminal justice bodies and victim support agencies. The report 
highlighted the need for States to actively manage the risk of unintended negative 
consequences; for example, that political pressure to prosecute traffickers leads to over-
enforcement, shortcuts and unacceptable trade-offs. It concluded that, while progress has 
been made on some fronts, much remains to be done. Unacceptably low prosecution and 
conviction rates around the world confirm that all States must be looking to improve their 
performance including by ensuring that the rights of all persons are respected and upheld.

<p><b> D. Prevention of trafficking: identifying the core strategies 
</b></p>
<p>62. As noted previously, prevention of trafficking through addressing underlying 
vulnerabilities of individuals and groups has been a key theme of the mandate since its 
inception. However the mandate has always accepted that the concept of prevention is 
much wider than this, encompassing the full range of measures aimed at preventing future 
acts of trafficking from occurring. International law requires that States act with due 
diligence to prevent trafficking and the human rights violations with which it is associated. 
The mandate has sought to explore what this means in practice through examining the 
general concept of prevention as well as particular aspects of a preventive approach 
including addressing demand78 and supply chain transparency and accountability.79 Key 
questions include, for example, what role should measures to encourage safe migration and 
protect labour rights play in a national or regional prevention strategy? Should States seek 
to raise public awareness about trafficking? What is required of States with respect to 
addressing demand for the goods and services produced through trafficking? How does the 
obligation of prevention operate in respect of addressing trafficking-related exploitation in 
supply chains and how can business be encouraged to support trafficking-free supply 
chains? These are complex, difficult issues and the mandate has not been able to address 
them in full, rather seeking to raise awareness among States and others that will help 
contribute to a greater understanding of what is required and how it may be achieved. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Safe migration 
</b></p>
<p>63. The creation of opportunities for legal, gainful and non-exploitative migration is key 
to preventing future trafficking. This responsibility falls on countries of origin as well as 
countries of destination. For the former, the provision of adequate information about 
migrants&#8217; rights, as well as practical advice on how to manage risks in the migratory 
process are integral obligations. Countries of origin should also ensure that they have the 
consular facilities to maintain contact with their citizens working abroad and respond 
effectively to any concerns.80 Countries of destination should ascertain the demand for 
migrant labour and develop the procedures and mechanisms that enable this demand to be 
met without exploitation. SRTIP Ezeilo has noted that multilateral and bilateral 
arrangements can often be an important way to increase opportunities for legal and non-
exploitative migration.81 The SRTIP has also highlighted the importance of ensuring that 
safe migration efforts are developed and implemented within a human rights framework in 
order to ensure that basic rights, such as freedom of movement and the prohibition on 
discrimination, are not compromised. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Labour rights 
</b></p>
<p>64. The mandate has ascertained that failure to protect the rights of workers, most 
particularly migrant workers, is a major contribution to trafficking-related exploitation. An 
increasingly globalized labour market that seeks to minimize production costs through low 
wages and maximum flexibility has increased the vulnerability of such workers who, 
deliberately left unprotected, can be paid badly; kept in debt bondage; subjected to harsh 
conditions; have their travel / identity / work documents confiscated; and dismissed when 
no longer needed. The involvement of recruitment agencies, many of which are unregulated

</p>
<p>and unsupervised, has created an additional layer of vulnerability for such workers, often 
trapping them in a debt from which it is very difficult to escape or being complicit in the 
deception that lands them in a situation of severe exploitation. In many countries, labour 
inspectorates are not up to the task of supervising workplaces and will anyway not have 
access to the common sites of exploitation for trafficked persons including brothels, private 
homes, farms and small factories. SRTIP Ezeilo has repeatedly called on States to 
strengthen enforcement of labour laws and take steps to regulate the recruitment agencies 
that, along with the legitimate businesses that use their services, are profiting so 
handsomely from the exploitation of migrant workers.82 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Public awareness 
</b></p>
<p>65. Awareness-raising campaigns can be an important method of prevention on two 
levels: first, by working with at-risk communities to warn them of the dangers of trafficking 
and second, by sensitizing the public in countries of destination about the plight of 
trafficked persons and informing them about their in role in prevention. However SRTIP 
Ezeilo has noted that public awareness campaigns are sometimes crude in conception and 
execution: employing sensationalist scare tactics or designed simply to stop people from 
moving. There has also been very little critical examination of the effect of such campaigns, 
including unintended negative effects that have been anecdotally noted by the current 
SRTIP in the course of her work,83 pointing to a need for all countries to monitor and 
regularly evaluate the impact of their prevention efforts. The SRTIP has emphasized that 
awareness campaigns must be based on accurate and adequate information and be followed 
by practical efforts to reduce vulnerability of victims and provide them with viable 
alternatives. Such campaigns should also be carefully developed to appeal to their target 
audience. For example, in relation to children and young people, the effectiveness of any 
public awareness program will depend heavily on the extent to which it uses 
communication channels that are relevant to this group. In this aspect of prevention as in all 
others, it is essential to ensure the active participation of vulnerable groups as well as 
trafficked persons themselves. Unfortunately while the principle is accepted, there appears 
to have been little progress in securing the meaningful participation of victims in the design 
and implementation of prevention efforts.84 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Addressing demand 
</b></p>
<p>66. As noted above, trafficking feeds into a global market that seeks out cheap, 
unregulated and exploitable labour and the goods and services that such labour can 
produce. In an early report, SRTIP Huda laid out the three elements of the mandate&#8217;s 
understanding of demand: (i) demand must be understood in relation to exploitation; (ii) 
demand as that which fosters exploitation, not necessarily as demand for that exploitation; 
and (iii) it is not necessary for the demand to lead to trafficking, rather, it is sufficient that 
the exploitation fostered by the demand leads to trafficking.85 SRTIP Huda subsequently 
applies that analysis to the issue of trafficking in women and girls for purposes of forced 
marriage.86 
</p>
<p>67. SRTIP Huda&#8217;s understanding of demand has been explicitly adopted by SRTIP 
Ezeilo in her own characterization of how the concept operates in the context of trafficking: 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>82
 See for example A/HRC/23/48 (2013), paras 26-27, 57 and 65.

<p>

<p> 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>27 
</b></p>
<p>68. The definition of demand, which is an economic term, can be adapted to the context 
of trafficking to describe it as the desire for labour that is exploitative or services which 
breach the human rights of the person delivering those services. It includes demand for 
sexual exploitation; for cheap labour and domestic workers; for organ removal and sale; for 
illicit adoption and forced marriages; for criminal activities or begging or for exploitation 
within the army ... The demand side of trafficking generally refers to the nature and extent 
of the exploitation of the trafficked persons after their arrival at the point of destination, as 
well as the social, cultural, political, economic, legal and developmental factors that shape 
the demand and facilitate the trafficking process. As such, it does not have to be &#8220;properly 
understood as the demand for a trafficking victim&#8217;s prostitution, labour or services. Rather, 
demand must be understood expansively, as any act that fosters any form of exploitation 
that, in turn, leads to trafficking&#8221; [quoting the first SRTIP87].88 
69. Both mandate holders have affirmed that international law requires States to 
discourage the demand that fosters trafficking-related exploitation.89 SRTIP Ezeilo has 
examined demand in detail in the context of a review of prevention90 as well as in a 
dedicated report.91 In the latter report, the SRTIP recommends that States take steps to 
understand the nature of demand and to develop measures based on accurate information 
and experience. Basic human rights, including the prohibition on discrimination, should 
further guide this process. The SRTIP also noted the importance of ensuring that measures 
to address demand do not themselves negatively affect individual rights and freedoms. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Supply chains and public&#8211;private partnerships 
</b></p>
<p>70. Throughout the decade of its existence the mandate has maintained a strong focus on 
non-State actors and the role they can or should play in preventing and responding to 
trafficking. This is an appropriate recognition of the fact that trafficking is a phenomenon 
located primarily within the community; that it is a crime perpetrated largely by private 
actors, and that civil society plays a key role in supporting victims. As understanding of 
how trafficking happens has improved, the mandate&#8217;s approach to particular parts of the 
private sector have likewise shifted. Specifically, information about trafficked labour in the 
supply chains of major industries including agriculture, information and communications 
technology, fishing, garments and textiles has alerted the mandate to the importance of 
engaging directly with business corporations. Unfortunately, the burgeoning &#8220;corporate 
social responsibility&#8221; industry has delivered few tangible benefits to the many millions of 
persons who produce the goods and services for global markets, often under terrible 
conditions of exploitation. Over the past several years SRTIP Ezeilo has taken up this 
difficult issue, undertaking research and holding wide-ranging consultations on trafficking 
in global supply chains. She has examined the different ways human trafficking manifests 
itself in the global economy; the response of global businesses; existing and emerging 
strategies to combat abuse; and the immediate and long-term steps necessary for business 
leaders to take effective and sustainable action. A dedicated report outlined a series of clear 
and practical recommendations for business and States to eliminate trafficking in the supply 
chain.92 This provided the basis for further consultations with business experts that resulted 
in a draft set of benchmarks and indicators for ensuring trafficking-free supply chains. The 
draft was presented to the Human Rights Council in June 2013.

<p><b> E. Trafficking in persons for the removal of organs 
</b></p>
<p>71. While specified as a form of trafficking-related exploitation in the international legal 
definition, the mandate did not deal substantively with the issue of trafficking in persons for 
the removal of organs (TPRO) until very recently. This reflected the paucity of reliable 
information on the practice and uncertainty around its true extent. However in recent years 
that situation has changed. There have been a series of highly reputable reports 
documenting systematic TPRO in several different regions of the world as well as major 
prosecutions for TPRO in both Africa and Europe. Anecdotal reports of TPRO were also 
provided to the mandate in the context of more recent country visits. In keeping with the 
mandate&#8217;s commitment to tackling difficult, emerging and under-researched issues, the 
current SRTIP decided to focus attention on TPRO with a view to contributing to the 
international conversation at a pivotal point. In 2013 she commissioned an expert 
background paper on the problem: formulated in accordance with current international 
policy as: &#8220;the exploitation of persons who are compelled by need or force to provide 
organs for transplantation to people within their own countries or to foreigners&#8221;.93 An 
informal group of transplant specialists, ethicists, and researchers was established to peer 
review the draft. On the basis of the final paper the SRTIP developed a dedicated report on 
TPRO, which was delivered to the United Nations General Assembly in August 2013.94 
</p>
<p>72. The report confirmed that while substantial gaps in knowledge and understanding 
remain, it is now well established that TPRO does indeed occur in all regions of the world 
and is not a rare event. The trade reflects economic and social divisions within and, most 
particularly, between countries. Victims are inevitably poor, often unemployed and with 
low education which makes them vulnerable to deception about the nature of the 
transaction and its potential impacts. Case studies from a variety of countries indicate that 
poor and often desperate individuals are lured into selling their organs on the promise of 
considerable payment that is almost never made in full. Many are also deceived about the 
nature of the procedure, the risks involved, and the follow-up care required or to be 
provided. Debt bondage and extortion are used as forms of coercion. Passports are 
commonly withheld as a means of keeping control over the movement of the victim prior to 
the operation. Trying to back out of an agreement to sell an organ is met with violence and 
threats of violence. After the transplantation, organizers continue to threaten victims in 
order to ensure their on-going silence. Victims are not offered adequate post-operative 
medical care and suffer physical and psychological harm as well as social exclusion. 
</p>
<p>73. The report emphatically identified TPRO as a violation of human rights and 
affirmed the obligation on States to prevent TPRO, to prosecute offenders and to protect 
victims. It noted the location of TPRO within broader debates around the organ trade and 
proposed that a rights-based approach to the broader issue supports a complete rejection of 
all forms of transplant commercialism because of the inherent and ultimately unmanageable 
risk of exploitation. The report set out a series of recommendations to States in relation to 
establishing a strong legal framework around TPRO and taking steps to prevent TPRO. 
Critically, the SRTIP highlighted the fact that measures to address all other forms of 
trafficking must be taken in relation to TPRO. For example, it is essential that States put in 
place victim identification procedures tailored to TPRO; provide all victims with immediate 
protection and support; ensure victims are not prosecuted or punished for status related 
offences (such as violation of transplant laws); deliver an effective criminal justice 
response; and provide victims with access to justice including an enforceable right to a 
remedy.

</b></p>
<p>74. In her report SRTIP Ezeilo questioned efforts to create a separate legal regime 
around &#8220;trafficking in organs&#8221;, noting that all evidence points to the trade in organs being 
inextricably linked to actions against individuals aimed at their exploitation. In her view it 
is essential to keep these practices firmly within the comprehensive and widely accepted 
legal regime that has been developed around trafficking in persons. This is the best way to 
promote conceptual clarity and also to ensure that States are held to account for any failures 
with respect to preventing TPRO, prosecuting offenders and protecting victims. While 
noting its correlation with other forms of trafficking, the SRTIP acknowledged that TPRO 
is a complex medical and ethical issue, requiring close collaboration between trafficking 
experts and members of the medical and transplant communities. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Contribution of the mandate to key conceptual and legal 
gains 
</b></p>
<p>75. The past decade has been one of great development and change. With the benefit of 
an agreed definition of trafficking in persons, new international, regional and national laws, 
clearer policies and heightened political commitment, the mandate has been able to make a 
critical contribution at a unique moment in time. This section identifies several particularly 
significant areas of progress and achievement focused particularly on conceptual and legal 
gains. It is not exhaustive and does not duplicate information contained elsewhere in the 
report &#8211; for example sections III and IV.(E) above detailing the mandate&#8217;s work on raising 
the profile and clarifying the applicable rules around the issues of remedies and trafficking 
for removal of organs. The Section includes information on contributions of the mandate 
secured through the questionnaires distributed to States and relevant organisation as part of 
the background work for this report. 
</p>
<p><b> A. A broader scope of focus 
</b></p>
<p>76. The mandate has actively embraced and advocated for the understanding of 
trafficking that is now enshrined in international law through the Trafficking Protocol and 
other instruments and reflected in the law of many States. This approach has been 
instrumental in helping to expand the focus of international and national anti-trafficking 
efforts beyond the previous focus on trafficking for exploitation of prostitution and 
contributing to greater conceptual clarity around the parameters of the definition of 
trafficking. Examples cited at various points throughout this report include the mandate&#8217;s 
focus on trafficking in men, as well as attention to issues such as forced marriage, 
trafficking in persons for removal of organs and trafficking for labour exploitation in 
agriculture, fishing and manufacturing. This wider focus, encouraged and facilitated by the 
mandate, is now well entrenched in national legal frameworks and the broader discourse 
around trafficking. 
</p>
<p>77. In their response to the questionnaire, a number of States and organizations 
highlighted the substantial contribution of the mandate to expanding the discourse around 
trafficking. This expansion was noted in relation to: (i) identification and exploration of 
different forms of trafficking exploitation; (ii) consideration of different avenues and actors 
that could or should play a role in preventing or responding to trafficking. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Trafficking and prostitution: no resolution but opening the debate 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>30</b> 
</p>
<p>hopefully providing an important circuit breaker in a debate that has often been destructive 
to broader goals of advancing human rights, dignity and freedom. There has however been 
a distinct difference in approach between the two mandate holders on this issue. In her 
second annual report, dealing with the question of demand, SRTIP Huda affirmed that 
international law does not require States to abolish prostitution. She further noted that 
international law requires States to treat as trafficking all adult prostitution in which people 
are subject to one of the stipulated acts (recruited, transported, harboured or received) by 
use of any of the stipulated means (including threat or use of force, coercion, abuse of 
power or of a position of vulnerability) for the purpose of exploiting their prostitution.95 
Based on her experiences and investigations as SRTIP, the first mandate holder found it 
evident that &#8220;most prostitution is accomplished by one or more of the illicit means outlined 
in &#8230;] the Protocol and therefore constitutes trafficking.&#8221;96 In her recommendations she 
took a principled stance against &#8220;legalization of prostituted persons&#8221; on the basis that this 
increases demand for trafficking. 
</p>
<p>79. The second mandate holder followed a different path. Particularly in her country 
reports, SRTIP Ezeilo has regularly identified prostitution as a major site of trafficking-
related exploitation, while noting that in law, prostitution and trafficking are not equivalent. 
Ezeilo has also been less willing than her predecessor to accept that measures taken to 
abolish prostitution will always have a positive impact on the problem of trafficking. In 
relation to the vexed question of demand for example, she points out the lack of a 
conclusive link either way. In her view, available evidence fails to provide a definitive 
answer to the question of whether, and how, legalization or criminalization of prostitution 
affects the existence and incidence of trafficking for sexual exploitation.97 In this regard 
SRTIP Ezeilo was also reflecting her own experience of finding trafficking for sexual 
exploitation in every country she visited, irrespective of how the national law dealt with the 
issue of prostitution. While not pronouncing directly on which approaches to prostitution 
should be adopted by States,98 SRTIP Ezeilo has consistently sought to widen the debate, 
shifting attention to tackling root causes while respecting the human rights of all trafficked 
persons. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Greater clarity on the rights of victims 
</b></p>
<p>80. It is one thing to assert the human rights of victims of trafficking and quite another 
to specify, with sufficient level of detail, what those rights actually are and what obligations 
they impose on States. That process is essential because it is only through such certainty 
that it becomes possible to assess the extent to which a particular situation, initiative or 
response is in conformity with international human rights law. The task is made somewhat 
more difficult by the fact that the central international instrument relevant to trafficking, the 
Trafficking Protocol, is not at all clear on the issue of victim rights. The Protocol makes 
some very general references to human rights and includes a number of obligations that 
may be understood as aimed at protecting victims. However, on its own, it makes little

 Note that SRTIP Ezeilo made clear her firm stance against any and all forms of prostitution involving

tolerance of that ugly phenomenon. See for example A/HRC/23/48/Add.3 (Mission to Philippines, 
2012), paras. 12&#8211;15, 24, 73; A/HRC/20/18/Add.2 (Mission to Thailand, 2012), paras. 13, 21, 77(y),

<p>headway in establishing the precise nature of victim entitlements and how these should be 
met. It is also relevant to note that at the time of the mandate&#8217;s commencement, the 
international human rights system itself had not contributed substantially to clarifying the 
substantive content of relevant rights and obligations. While there was regular 
condemnation of the human rights violations associated with trafficking, the practice was 
rarely linked to the violation of a specific right in a specific treaty. In the work of one 
commentator, &#8220;working out the &#8216;wrong&#8217; of trafficking with reference to international 
human rights law was a difficult and frustrating task&#8221;.99 
</p>
<p>81. From its commencement, the mandate was able to build on several developments 
that challenged this situation. One of the most significant was the issuing of the 
<i>Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking</i> two 
years previously, which proved instrumental in shaping the mandate&#8217;s approach to victim 
rights and State obligations in many different contexts. Throughout the past decade, 
increasing attention to trafficking by different parts of the international human rights 
system, as well as by regional courts, has further supported the mandate in detailing the 
rights of victims and the corresponding obligations of States. Today, it is possible to say 
that there is widespread recognition that victims of trafficking are indeed the holders of a 
special set of rights conferred upon them by their status as trafficked persons. These include 
but are not limited to, the right to be identified quickly and accurately; the right to 
immediate protection and support; the right to legal information and the opportunity to 
decide whether and how to cooperate in the prosecution of their exploiters; the right not to 
be detained; the right to not be prosecuted for offences that relate directly to the fact of 
having been trafficked; the right to be returned home safely or to benefit from another 
solution if safe return is not possible; and the right to an effective remedy that reflects the 
harm committed against them. It is also now widely accepted that certain categories of 
victims, most particularly children, benefit from additional, status-related rights in 
recognition of their special vulnerabilities and special needs. 
</p>
<p>82. Throughout all aspects of its work, from country visits to thematic studies, the 
mandate has helped to confirm and promote awareness of these important rights. 
Respondents to the questionnaire confirmed that the mandate&#8217;s work in this area was one of 
its most significant achievements. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Greater clarity on the obligations and responsibilities of States 
</b></p>
<p>83. As noted by a number of respondents to the questionnaire, the mandate has also 
directly contributed to confirming and disseminating the obligations on States with respect 
to their response to trafficking. Many of those obligations arise through the rights set out 
above. For example the mandate has repeatedly drawn attention to the responsibility of 
States to take active steps to identify victims of trafficking; establish systems and processes 
to provide victims with the protection and support they require; refrain from detaining 
victims or prosecuting them for status offences; to cooperate with other States in ensuring 
that victims are returned safely and reintegrated effectively; develop alternative solutions 
for those victims who cannot be safely returned; and develop laws and procedures that 
ensure victims are able to realize their right to a remedy. However the mandate has also 
been very clear on the point that the obligations of States extend beyond those that relate 
immediately to victims. In relation to criminal justice responses for example, SRTIP Ezeilo 
has confirmed the obligation on all States to investigate and prosecute trafficking, as well as

</p>
<p>the obligation to protect the rights of suspects and the right to a fair trial.100 Through 
country visit reports the mandate holders have also highlighted the link between corruption 
and trafficking: noting that States are required to act in preventing such corruption and 
dealing with it once it is uncovered.101 More broadly, and particularly during the tenure of 
SRTIP Ezeilo, the mandate has examined the implications of the legal obligation on States 
to take steps to prevent trafficking: detailing the actions that should be taken within the 
framework of a human rights approach.102 
</p>
<p>84. It is an unfortunate fact that State responses to trafficking can sometimes result in a 
violation of human rights. Occasionally such a result is unintentional. For example, the 
SRTIP has reported instances where States have sought to protect their citizens from 
trafficking by preventing them from migrating for work.103 Despite their protective 
intention, such actions may constitute an unlawful restriction of the right to leave and the 
right to freedom of movement and, typically being directed solely at women, also a 
violation of the prohibition on discrimination. Violation of suspects&#8217; right to a fair trial; and 
prevention strategies developed and implemented outside the framework of a victim-
centred, rights-based approach are further examples that have been raised by the SRTIP in 
the context of both thematic and country reporting.104 By highlighting the most prevalent 
risks, and by documenting instances of compromised responses, the mandate has played a 
crucial role in raising awareness of the obligation on States to respond lawfully and ensure 
that their anti-trafficking efforts do not violate established rights. 
</p>
<p>85. Finally, it is important to note that the widened scope, as well as clarification of both 
rights and obligations around trafficking has had a significant impact on how the issue is 
approached and dealt with in the international human rights system itself. There is now 
uniform acceptance of the concept of trafficking, accommodating a range of exploitative 
practices directed at women, men and children. Resolutions of the General Assembly and 
the Human Rights Council on trafficking contain increasingly detailed and specific 
references to human rights of victims and to corresponding responsibilities of States.105 The 
human rights treaty bodies regularly raise issues related to trafficking in their consideration 
of States parties reports,106 including the risk of responses to trafficking violating 
established rights.107 Resulting recommendations issued by treaty bodies are today much 
more nuanced and detailed than previously, reflecting an enhanced awareness of the 
problem of trafficking as well as the applicable legal framework.108 Some human rights 
mechanisms have themselves made substantial contributions to that framework. For 
example the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment has examined the circumstances under which trafficking may come within 
the prohibition on torture.109 The Committee on the Rights of the Child has been 
instrumental in identifying the human rights standards that apply to unaccompanied 
children, a group that, as the Committee has acknowledged, includes many child victims of

<p>trafficking.110 The integration of trafficking into the broader human rights system has been 
instrumental in promoting and sustaining momentum for change. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Key challenges 
</b></p>
<p>86. The work of the mandate has confirmed that the problem of human trafficking 
continues to be endemic in all parts of the world. While awareness of trafficking and of 
relevant rights and obligations has improved significantly, this has not resulted in 
substantial improvements on the ground. Large number of women, men and children 
continue to be exploited; very few receive support, protection or redress; few exploiters are 
apprehended and in every country the number of prosecutions remains stubbornly low. 
Many of the obstacles to a more effective response have been addressed in the previous 
sections of the report. The present section seeks to draw out those challenges that are likely 
to be of particular concern to the international community as well as to the mandate as it 
evolves into the future. It draws on information secured through the questionnaires 
distributed to States and relevant organisation as part of the background work for this 
report. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Clarifying the parameters of the international legal definition 
</b></p>
<p>87. This report has made clear that adoption of an agreed international definition of 
trafficking in 2000 was a major step forward, paving the way for much of the progress over 
the past fourteen years. However it would be a mistake to assume that the adoption of the 
definition ended discussion around the parameters of trafficking. In fact, there remains 
vigorous debate within and between States and others over what conduct is or is not 
&#8220;trafficking&#8221;. For example, to what extent does the act of &#8220;harbouring&#8221; enable the definition 
to encompass the maintenance of an individual in a situation of exploitation and not just 
movement into that situation? Would a single, minor deception at the recruitment stage be 
sufficient to turn an exploitative situation into one of trafficking? Is consent of the victim 
ever relevant in establishing whether trafficking has occurred? How broadly should the 
means &#8220;abuse of a position of vulnerability&#8221; be read? For example, should it include 
vulnerability related to economic necessity or to immigration status? How broadly should 
&#8220;exploitation&#8221; (including &#8220;sexual exploitation&#8221;) be understood? What criteria, if any, 
should be used to determine whether other exploitative practices are to be included within 
the open-ended list set out in the international definition? What are the relationships among 
trafficking and related practices also prohibited under international law including slavery, 
servitude and forced labour? When would an instance of forced labour or slavery <i>not</i> be 
trafficking? How should exploitation through debt bondage be understood in context of 
modern recruitment and employment practices? And critically, at what point does a bad 
employment situation metamorphose into trafficking? 
</p>
<p>88. As UNODC has noted, these questions are important because to characterize certain 
conduct as &#8220;trafficking&#8221; has significant and wide-ranging consequences for States, the 
alleged perpetrators of that conduct, and the alleged victims. It also has highly significant 
for the many organizations and agencies that are engaged in fighting &#8220;trafficking&#8221;. UNODC 
identifies &#8220;a tension between those who support a conservative or even restrictive 
interpretation of the concept of trafficking, and those who advocate for its expansion. The 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>34</b> 
</p>
<p>complex and fluid definition in the Protocol provides justification for both perspectives, and 
has contributed to ensuring that such tensions remain unresolved&#8221;.111 
</p>
<p>89. It is the view of the SRTIP that these issues must be faced head on, not least because 
the stakes are too high to allow those with the loudest voices or greatest resources to skew 
the debate. The international community should be taking a leadership role in efforts to 
critically examine problematic aspects of the international legal framework, while being 
mindful of vested interests and conflicting agendas that will likely favour a particular 
reading of the definition. The SRTIP is encouraged by the Conference of Parties to the 
Trafficking Protocol, which has launched a pioneering study into critical definitional 
concepts such as abuse of a position of vulnerability, consent and exploitation. As 
Secretariat to the Conference of Parties to the Trafficking Protocol, UNODC has been 
leading this high quality research effort, which is engaged not just in providing guidance to 
treaty interpretation but also in discovering exactly what States are doing with these fluid 
and contested concepts. The SRTIP has been pleased to support this initiative through 
direct involvement in expert practitioner consultations and panel discussions with States, 
intergovernmental organizations and others as well as in actively disseminating relevant 
reports and guidance.112 In her view this important work is laying a solid foundation for 
what must be a much broader consideration of the legal framework around trafficking and 
related issues, with a view, to promoting the conceptual clarity that is a prerequisite to 
effective, well-coordinated responses. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Strengthening accountability of non-State actors 
</b></p>
<p>90. SRTIP Ezeilo considers that securing greater accountability of States for trafficking-
related harm has been one of the major achievements of the broader anti-trafficking 
movement over the past decade. Despite often being only indirectly implicated in such 
harm, States have come to understand and accept their legal responsibility to respond to 
trafficking by protecting victims, investigating and prosecuting perpetrators to the required 
level of due diligence, and working to the same standard to prevent future trafficking. 
</p>
<p>91. Unfortunately, there has been much less progress in establishing ways of increasing 
accountability of non-State actors who are also implicated, often more directly, in the harm 
of trafficking. In relation to traffickers and their accomplices, an effective criminal justice 
response is the primary avenue for securing both criminal and civil responsibility. However 
it is now well understood that many other non-State actors are involved in, and profit from, 
trafficking-related exploitation including large corporations that benefit from cheap, 
exploited labour in their supply chain and recruitment agencies that channel vulnerable 
individuals into exploitation. SRTIP Ezeilo&#8217;s work has documented involvement of many 
other private entities including medical practitioners.113 It is in relation to these individuals 
and groups that significant challenges remain in securing accountability. 
</p>
<p>92. The issue of corporate accountability for trafficking has become an increasingly 
pressing one, as information comes to light about the extent to which the supply chains of 
major corporations and industries are tainted by forced and highly exploited labour. The 
fishing sector is a case in point. Over the past several years, investigations by the United 
Nations and independent journalists have documented cases of Ukrainian crews forced to

<p>work at gunpoint in the Northern Pacific; fishermen from Myanmar on Thai boats, 
murdered and thrown overboard when their capacity to work was diminished through 
starvation, overwork and disease; and West African children as young as four lured away 
from their parents for a life of hardship and abuse on inland lakes or in the middle of the 
Indian Ocean.114 Trafficking has also been documented in foreign-owned vessels fishing 
legally in the waters of New Zealand. The catch from the boats is sold to local processing 
companies with worldwide distribution, ending up on the plates of Australian and North 
American consumers.115 The garment industry provides another example of tainted supply 
chains: a situation again brought to public attention through the terrible tragedy of a fire in 
Bangladesh that claimed the lives of over one thousand impoverished, low-paid and 
unprotected workers, most of them women.116 
</p>
<p>93. SRTIP Ezeilo is conscious of the difficulties inherent in improving the transparency 
of supply chains &#8211; a necessary prerequisite for dealing with exploitation. The globalization 
of production means that many corporations are themselves often not aware of the 
conditions under which goods and services produced for them are obtained. While such 
obstacles are real, they may also be used as an excuse to avoid meaningful action. In some 
instances it appears that the use of third parties (for example, recruitment agencies) is 
motivated by a deliberate intention to distance the corporation from responsibility for 
exploitation. The SRTIP is of the view that businesses must be required to take at least the 
minimum steps necessary to assess their supply chains for risk of exploitation; to deal with 
any exploitation found; and to put in place mechanisms for effective future monitoring. 
Initiatives aimed at promoting greater responsibility and self-regulation should be 
encouraged, particularly those that are rights-based and widely supported such as the 
United Nation&#8217;s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, endorsed by the 
Human Rights Council in 2011.117 However experience has shown that self-regulation 
measures are often inadequate. Codes of conduct and sector-wide verification procedures 
can be near worthless unless accompanied by independent monitoring. Other stakeholders, 
such as consumers and the media, have an important role in holding corporations to 
account. 
</p>
<p>94. Discussions around corporate responsibility should not distract from the fact that it 
is States that have the ultimate responsibility to prevent and respond to human rights 
violations associated with trafficking that are occurring within their jurisdiction or 
otherwise under their control. In short, it is up to States to ensure the accountability of non-
State actors involved in trafficking and related exploitation. While that obligation is 
imposed on all States, the SRTIP has noted that it lies particularly heavily on those States 
within which the exploitation actually occurs.118 These States should be strengthening the 
enforcement of their labour laws. They should also be regulating the activities of public and 
private recruitment agencies, paying particular attention to those agencies that charge fees 
to workers to secure a placement, as this is often a direct gateway to exploitative debt.

<p>Other States can support such actions by legislating for transparency in supply chains &#8211; 
particularly for Government suppliers.119 They can promote public-private partnerships to 
engage community and business in preventing trafficking and can develop incentives that 
encourage transparency and active risk management. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Involving civil society and the community 
</b></p>
<p>95. Civil society plays a key role in exposing human rights violations associated with 
trafficking; in raising awareness within the community; in assisting and supporting victims; 
and in holding Governments and others to account for failures to prevent trafficking, bring 
perpetrators to justice and protect victims. The mandate has benefited enormously from the 
work of civil society in each of these areas. In relation to country visits, civil society 
organizations have provided the SRTIP with valuable insights that have contributed to 
shaping views and recommendations and in helping to galvanize momentum for change. In 
the thematic work of the mandate SRTIP Ezeilo has been able to draw on a wealth of 
expertise from groups as diverse as human rights organizations, medical associations and 
business councils.  
</p>
<p>96. The experience of the mandate has underlined the critical role that civil society must 
play in the response to trafficking at national, regional and international levels. This is not 
an issue that can be solved &#8211; or even effectively addressed &#8211; by States alone. While civil 
society input is generally strong, much remains to be done. In her work SRTIP Ezeilo has 
often noted tensions between civil society groups working on trafficking and States. Such 
difficulties can be exacerbated when the relevant organizations lack the resources (and 
sometimes also the expertise) required for them to contribute effectively. And in some 
countries civil society is underdeveloped and does not have the capacity to provide a 
meaningful contribution. Of course, civil society must also commit itself to a rights-based 
response to trafficking and be prepared to monitor its performance in that regard. There 
have been isolated but worrying instances where organizations working with trafficked 
persons have themselves been implicated in human rights violations. The detention of 
trafficked persons in shelters (irrespective of how such detention is described and justified) 
is one pertinent example of civil society failing in its own obligations to victims of 
trafficking. 
</p>
<p>97. SRTIP Ezeilo has repeatedly recognized the power of the media in raising 
community awareness about trafficking in all its forms and informing vulnerable groups 
about certain migration risks. However that power makes it particularly important that 
media treatment of the issue of trafficking is both accurate and appropriate. The mandate 
has noted repeated examples of media sensationalism, manifested for example through a 
prurient and overly narrow focus on sexual exploitation. Other problems that are regularly 
encountered include failure to adequately protect victims&#8217; privacy; stigmatization of 
victims; and fostering confusion between trafficking and other phenomena such as irregular 
migration and migrant smuggling. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>119
 The United States of America has taken several important steps in this regard. For example the 
</p>
<p>Californian Supply Chain Act (compelling companies that meet certain threshold requirements 
to disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their supply chains) and 
Executive Order 13627, &#8220;Strengthening Protections Against Trafficking in Persons in Federal 
Contracts&#8221; (requiring United States&#8217; Government contractors and sub-contractors to comply with 
basic conduct rules aimed at addressing trafficking in supply chains). The latter rule is expected to be 
supplemented by new federal procurement rules to enter into force in 2014. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>37 
</b></p>
<p>98. Trafficking is a crime and human rights violation that largely takes place within the 
community, and communities have an important role to play in identifying trafficking and 
working to prevent the exploitation with which it is associated. Some States have sought to 
engage the broader community in their anti-trafficking efforts. However such initiatives are 
rarely well planned, systematic or long-term and do not appear to have resulted in 
significant impact. The SRTIP considers it essential that the public be made aware of their 
individual and collective responsibilities with respect to trafficking-related exploitation. For 
example, in countries where the purchase of sexual services is not criminalized, it is 
nevertheless essential to ensure that persons engaged in such conduct understand their 
obligation (which should preferably be entrenched in law) to ensure that those services are 
being traded without constraint. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Involving victims and vulnerable groups 
</b></p>
<p>99. SRTIP Ezeilo has consistently sought to engage victims in all aspects of her work 
and is of the view that the mandate has benefited enormously from this approach. 
Respondents to the questionnaire affirmed this finding: emphasizing the importance of the 
mandate focusing on the lived experiences of victims and drawing on strong, evidence-
based research. A number of respondents identified efforts of the current SRTIP to give a 
&#8216;voice&#8217; to victims, including at the Human Rights Council and General Assembly, as a 
major achievement. 
100. Unfortunately, the voices of victims of trafficking are too often silenced. Despite a 
growing acknowledgement of the importance of listening to victims,120 they are very rarely 
consulted about their experiences. This deprives States and others of valuable information 
that could help make responses more realistic and effective. For example, while the reasons 
why victims are reluctant to cooperate in the prosecution of their exploiters are generally 
well known,121 there is little insight into victims&#8217; actual experience with national criminal 
justice systems. As a result, efforts to reform criminal justice systems and processes may be 
compromised by a lack of understanding about the exact nature of the challenges. Similarly, 
in the course of her discussions with victims of trafficking, SRTIP Ezeilo has learned that 
many do not wish to avail themselves of shelter and other facilities that have been 
established, ostensibly for their benefit. It is only through consulting carefully and regularly 
with victims that States and service providers can come to fully understand their specific 
needs and how these can be met. These tendencies are replicated at the regional and 
national levels where policies and practices are frequently developed without any 
meaningful participation of - or even consultation with - the ultimate &#8216;beneficiaries&#8217;. 
</p>
<p>101. Of course, the difficulties of securing the safe and mutually beneficial participation 
of victims in identifying and formulating responses to trafficking should not be 
underestimated. Often, it will not be practical or even safe for victims to take on this role. 
In such cases those seeking the involvement of victims have an ethical responsibility to 
ensure that such involvement is always strictly voluntary, based on informed consent and 
do not cause further harm. There is also a risk that the voice of victims can be distorted: for 
example where a very small number of victims are taken as speaking for a larger group 
whose views and concerns can be expected to be very diverse. In certain situations it may

</p>
<p><b> E. Improving compliance mechanisms at national, regional and 
international levels 
</b></p>
<p>102. The mandate has often drawn attention to a worrying gap between obligations of 
States with regard to trafficking (what States are required to do or refrain from doing) and 
the extent to which those obligations are met in practice (what actually happens). This is 
particularly the case with regard to the right of victims that, despite being protected by 
international and national laws, are too often disregarded. This is not always the result of a 
lack of political will. The complexity of the trafficking phenomenon; uncertainty about 
aspects of the solution; and the fact that States are rarely the direct perpetrators of 
trafficking-related harm all complicate the task of securing compliance with international 
legal rules. Improving compliance mechanisms at all levels must be a priority for States and 
the international community. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. At the national level 
</b></p>
<p>103. The mandate has repeatedly called on States to strengthen their implementation 
machinery and has sought to provide practical guidance to States on implementing a rights-
based approach. A number of respondents to the questionnaire identified this as a key 
contribution of the mandate. SRTIP Ezeilo has consistently advocated for the establishment 
of national rapporteurs or similar mechanisms in countries that do not yet have such a 
position. Where they do exist (principally, at present, in Europe), independent, 
appropriately tasked national rapporteurs have generally played an important role in 
monitoring the national situation; facilitating collaboration between different agencies as 
well as between the Government and civil society; and overseeing the collection and 
analysis of data on the national response and trafficking trends. Their central role was 
confirmed at a 2013 consultative meeting convened by the SRTIP that brought together, for 
the first time, national rapporteurs, from 19 countries. A follow up meeting is scheduled to 
take place in mid-2014. Of course the national rapporteur mechanism is just one way for 
States to approach the challenge of compliance. The SRTIP has encouraged States to 
consider additional paths to this end including the development of national plans of action 
against trafficking and establishment of broad-based consultation groups to advise and 
support implementation. 
</p>
<p>104. The mandate notes the unilateral compliance mechanism established by the United 
States&#8217; Government that undertakes annual assessments of the trafficking situation in each 
State and the quality of the national response.122 SRTIP Ezeilo has established excellent 
working relations with the relevant office and its officials and generally welcomes this 
initiative as an important contribution to promoting strong national responses as well as 
increased awareness about trafficking throughout the world. However she cautions that the 
criteria used to assess national performance should be explicitly based on international 
standards. This is not just essential to the credibility of the mechanism, it is also an 
important way to strengthen the international legal framework and affirm its key standards.

</b></p>
<p><b> 2. At the regional level 
</b></p>
<p>105. SRTIP Ezeilo has devoted considerable attention to examining the capacity of 
regional and sub-regional bodies and cooperation agreements to contribute to national and 
global anti-trafficking efforts and thereby improve compliance with international rights and 
obligations. In her view such bodies / agreements are often well placed to provide a 
response that is multilateral in outlook while also being cognizant of national realities. It is 
also apparent that regional groupings can exercise a positive influence on Member and 
participating States: an influence that may be diluted at the international level. 
Unfortunately, coverage is very uneven. Some regions are very well served, particularly 
Europe, which benefits from the robust implementation mechanisms established under the 
Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. Other parts 
of the world do not have strong regional resources to call on. In a report dedicated to this 
issue the SRTIP encouraged those regional mechanisms that are already working on 
trafficking to strengthen their efforts, potentially through mechanisms such as regional 
working groups and regional action plans that can influence national policy and national 
decision makers.123 Regional mechanisms could also usefully explore how they may 
cooperate with each other, for example in relation to sharing of information and 
experiences. The report stressed the importance of a rights-based and victim-centred 
approach, noting again that regional bodies are often well-placed to understand how such 
approaches can be operationalized to best effect. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. At the international level 
</b></p>
<p>106. The international legal framework around trafficking includes a range of institutions 
and processes contributing, in one way or another, to promoting national implementation of 
the applicable international rules.124 Within the international human rights system this 
includes most of the treaty bodies as well as a number of the special procedures in addition 
to the present mandate that deal with issues related to trafficking such as slavery-like 
practices, the rights of migrants and the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography. Under the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime 
a Conference of Parties operates to promote compliance with that instrument.125 In 2008 the 
Conference of Parties established a Working Group to focus specifically on the Trafficking 
Protocol.126 The SRTIP has regularly participated in Working Group meetings and 
welcomes this mechanism as an important vehicle for promoting compliance with what 
remains the key international treaty on trafficking. It should be noted however that the 
Working Group does not equate, in any way, to a human rights treaty body. It does not 
examine reports from States parties on implementation of the Protocol and does not issue 
recommendations to individual State parties, engage in a constructive dialogue, or 
otherwise interact with States parties in a structured way. 
</p>
<p>107. These mechanisms are valuable and should be supported. But they can also be 
strengthened, particularly in terms of influencing national responses to trafficking and 
promoting acceptance of rights-based and victim-centred approaches. As previously noted

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>124
 Note also a number of funding mechanisms that have been established to support implementation of 
</p>
<p>that framework, for example the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Victims of Trafficking in 
Persons (Especially Women and Children (established by the General Assembly following adoption 
of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons) and the United 
Nations Voluntary Fund on Contemporary Forms of Slavery (established in 1991 by General 
Assembly resolution 46/122 and operating through OHCHR).

</p>
<p>the international human rights system&#8217;s attention to trafficking has improved dramatically 
over the life of the mandate. However, more systematic coordination between the most 
directly implicated mechanisms &#8211; including those within the Special Procedures - could 
have an important catalytic effect. The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of the Human 
Rights Council has also been identified by the SRTIP as a critical vehicle for examining 
State responses to trafficking from the perspective of human rights and greater use could 
certainly be made of this mechanism. States parties to the Trafficking Protocol could also 
be encouraged to take up the challenge of implementation more creatively: for example by 
opening the UPR Working Group up to some civil society input and providing it with more 
substantive oversight responsibilities. Trafficking remains a difficult issue for all States and 
increased support aimed at helping them meeting their international obligations should be 
widely welcomed. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusion: towards the future 
</b>108. <b>The Human Rights Council is to be congratulated for its wisdom and foresight 
in establishing a mechanism that has ensured human rights retain their rightful place 
at the centre of the international response to trafficking. This role has been 
particularly important in light of the fact that the key international treaty on 
trafficking was established outside the human rights system. State and partners 
surveyed as part of the preparation for this report have affirmed the mandate&#8217;s 
positive impact on their work as well as on the anti-trafficking sector as a whole. They 
have drawn particular attention to the SRTIP&#8217;s contribution to standard setting; to 
mainstreaming human rights into anti-trafficking discourse; and to drawing attention 
to emerging and less well known forms of trafficking. 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>On this basis, the Special Rapporteur offers the following recommendations for 
the Human Rights Council and future mandate holders. 
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>The Human Rights Council should: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Continue the mandate, in recognition of the prevalence of trafficking in 
persons and the need for longer-term strategies that reflect and advance a human 
rights-based approach; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Consider abbreviating the title of the mandate by removing the specific 
reference to women and children. While that reference is part of the title of the 
Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women 
and Children, it may deflect attention from the reality, that trafficking is a problem 
affecting men as well as women and children. However the substance of the mandate: 
&#8220;promote the prevention of trafficking in persons in all its forms and the adoption of 
measures to uphold and protect the human rights of victims&#8221;</b>127<b> has proved to be a 
sound one that requires no substantial modifications; 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>Future mandate-holders could usefully focus on conceptual and definitional 
overlaps; the consequences of a human rights-based approach to trafficking; 
measuring the impact of anti-trafficking interventions; corruption and trafficking; 
and the effectiveness of victim identification tools. They should: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Consider undertaking studies in relation to new and emerging areas of 
concern such as: (i) illicit recruitment practices; (ii) trafficking in men for forced and 
exploitative labour; (iii) trafficking for forced begging and criminal activities; (iv) 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>41 
</b></p>
<p><b>trafficking for forced or servile marriage; (v) return and the risk of retrafficking. 
They should consider giving further attention to trafficking in persons for the removal 
of organs in continuation of the initial work undertaken by the SRTIP; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Continue the cooperation between the mandate and international and 
regional organizations working on trafficking; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Consider collaborating with the Special Rapporteur on contemporary 
forms of slavery, including its causes and consequences, the Special Rapporteur on the 
sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and Special Rapporteur on 
the human rights of migrants to capitalize on common interests and approaches; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Continue closer human rights-based collaboration with international, 
regional and national mechanisms to combat trafficking in persons in consultation 
with victims;</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(e) Continue promoting implementation of the Protocol to Prevent, 
Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children and 
relevant regional instruments, as well as standards and policies related to trafficking 
in persons, including encouraging States to incorporate the draft basic principles on 
the right to an effective remedy for trafficked persons into domestic legislation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Continue promoting the involvement of civil society in all international 
and regional forums where anti-trafficking responses are discussed, including 
discussions on the review mechanism for the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and 
Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children. </b></p>
