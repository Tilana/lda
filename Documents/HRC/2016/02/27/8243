<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea was established by the Commission on Human 
Rights pursuant to its resolution 2004/13, and has been renewed annually since. Also 
pursuant to that resolution, the Special Rapporteur submit two reports every year: one to the 
Human Rights Council, ) at its main session in March, and another to the General 
Assembly. In his most recent report submitted to the General Assembly (A/66/322), the 
Special Rapporteur focused on human rights concerns such as the right to food, violence 
against women, prison camps, the right to health, to water and to sanitation, freedom of 
opinion and expression, issues concerning humanitarian space for United Nations entities to 
operate in the country, and the protection concerns of asylum-seekers from the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea.  
</p>
<p>2. In the present report, besides providing an overview of the situation in the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, the Special Rapporteur proposes some key 
conclusions and recommendations for the State and the international community, 
particularly neighbouring countries.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Methodology  
</b></p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur relied on numerous sources of information in order to 
ensure that the report reflects diverse ideas. He also attempted to contact non-governmental 
organizations and individuals with which has did not interact during his previous visits to 
the region. Since his appointment in August 2010, the Special Rapporteur has made 
numerous requests to visit the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. In addition, he also 
requested meetings with officials of the Permanent Mission of the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea, both in New York and in Geneva. None of his requests have received a 
favourable response. Most recently, since the succession of the leadership in the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, the Special Rapporteur has approached the State 
authorities both for a meeting and a visit to the country, in the hope of a change in approach 
to the mandate of the Special Rapporteur.  
</p>
<p>4. Since the presentation of his report to the General Assembly in October 2011, the 
Special Rapporteur has conducted two missions to the North-East Asia region: to the 
Republic of Korea, from21 to 25 November 2011, and to Japan, from 14 to 20 January 
</p><p>2012. The objective of his missions was to assess the human rights situation in the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea and its impact on neighbouring countries, such as 
the Republic of Korea and Japan. The report summarizes the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
observations and the information that he gathered during the field missions, with reports, 
interviews, briefing papers and other documents gathered by non-governmental 
organizations, United Nations offices and numerous other reliable sources.  
</p>
<p>5. During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mission to the Republic of Korea, he held meetings 
with the Deputy Minister for Multilateral Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
Trade, members of the Inter-Parliamentarians&#8217; Coalition for North Korean Refugees and 
Human Rights, the Director-General of the International Organizations Bureau and the 
Senior Policy Coordination Officer for the Unification Policy of the Ministry of 
Unification. He also had the opportunity to interact with the National Human Rights 
Commission of Korea, national and international non-governmental organizations, 
diplomats and other relevant individuals.  </p>


<p>6. In Japan, the Special Rapporteur held several meetings with the Minister for Foreign 
Affairs, the Minister in-charge of abduction issues, the Deputy Vice-Minister for Foreign 
Policy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ambassador in charge of United Nations 
affairs and the Deputy Director General of Asian and Oceanian Affairs. He also interacted 
with national and international non-governmental organizations, diplomats and other 
relevant individuals working on the human rights and the humanitarian situation in the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. While in Japan, the Special Rapporteur ensured 
that he spent substantial time listening to the families of abducted Japanese nationals and 
visited the cities of Niigata and Kashiwazaki in Niigata prefecture, where five Japanese 
nationals were abducted in 1977 and 1978.  
</p>
<p>7. While the main focus of his visit to the Republic of Korea and to Japan was to gather 
information on human rights violations of the people of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic 
of Korea, the issue of abduction of foreign nationals by the agents of the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, family reunion of separated Korean families, the situation of 
asylum-seekers from the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea and the humanitarian 
situation, in particular the food situation in that country, the Special Rapporteur was also 
briefed on the current status of the six-party talks, bilateral Japan-Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea and Republic of Korea-Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea 
meetings, and the situation in the Korean peninsula in general.  
</p>
<p>8. At the outset, the Special Rapporteur wishes to point out that there has not been 
much progress on most of the above-mentioned issues since his previous visits to the 
Republic of Korea and to Japan, in November 2010 and January 2011, respectively. Indeed, 
the Special Rapporteur believes that there has been a significant deterioration in the human 
rights situation in the country. In the Republic of Korea and in Japan, the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s meetings seemed to substantiate  the reports of the dire humanitarian situation 
and absence of civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights for the people of the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. The question of 17 identified cases of abduction of 
Japanese nationals by the agents of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea also 
remains unresolved. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Overview of the current situation 
</b></p>
<p>9. In early 2011, Kim Jong-Un was made a four-star general and appointed deputy 
chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Workers&#8217;' Party, which was seen by 
many international observers as a part of the power transition from his father, Kim Jong-il. 
In December 2011, the death of Kim Jong-il led to the succession of Kim Jong-Un as the 
new leader of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. Since his succession in 
December 2011, State media have bestowed on him a number of new titles, such as the 
&#8220;Great Successor&#8221;, the &#8220;Supreme Leader&#8221; and the &#8220;Sagacious Leader&#8221;. In the light of the 
succession, different views were shared with the Special Rapporteur on how the country 
might proceed in its approach to engaging with the international community and addressing 
human rights concerns. The Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that the ramifications of 
this change on the people of Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea and on the 
international community will only unfold in the comings months.  
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur hopes that the new leadership in the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea will use the recent succession as an opportunity to engage with the 
international community and to secure global confidence. The Special Rapporteur believes 
that the current transition may be a window of opportunity for the country to adopt a reform 
process and address all questions and concerns in relation to human rights, which will be 
welcomed from all quarters.  </p>


<p>11. The six-party talks on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula involving the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, China, Japan, the Russian 
Federation and the United States of America are at a standstill. The Special Rapporteur was 
briefed on this important topic during his missions to both the Republic of Korea and to 
Japan. The Special Rapporteur believes that, although human rights is not one of the topics 
for discussion at the six-party talks, progress made during them will assist discussions on 
other issues, such as the human rights situation of the people of the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea.  
</p>
<p>12. With regard to the State&#8217;s cooperation with United Nations human rights 
mechanisms, despite several calls made by the Secretary-General and the Special 
Rapporteur, including in their reports presented to the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth 
session, the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea continues to be late in reporting to the 
treaty bodies or uncooperative with the special procedures, including with the thematic 
mandate holders. During the reporting period, the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea 
took no new steps to report to the treaty bodies or to invite any thematic special procedures.  
</p>
<p>13.  There were, however, small signs of cooperation with other United Nations entities, 
for instance with the World Food Programme (WFP) and the Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs. In late October 2011, the Emergency Relief Coordinator travelled to 
the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to assess the humanitarian situation in the 
country. The Coordinator&#8217;s five-day mission included field visits to two hospitals, an 
orphanage, a local market and communal farm, and a Government public-distribution 
centre. After the visit, the Coordinator called on the international community to provide 
more financial support and for creative solutions to overcome the food shortages in the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. In her assessment, the crisis is caused primarily by 
a complex mix of chronic poverty and underdevelopment, in addition to natural disasters. 
Agricultural production is constrained by soil degradation, difficult weather conditions and 
very limited mechanization. She also highlighted the fact that the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea does not have enough arable land to produce all the food it needs, and 
would not be self-sufficient for the foreseeable future. The Special Rapporteur notes that 
many other partners shared this assessment.  
</p>
<p>14. Following the Emergency Relief Coordinator&#8217;s mission to the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea, the Special Rapporteur exchanged views with her on the humanitarian 
situation in the country, and was in continual contact with her Office. The Special 
Rapporteur calls on the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to take the opportunity of 
the recent visit of the Emergency Relief Coordinator to engage more openly with her Office 
and with the United Nations in general.  
</p>
<p>15. In the coming months, the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea will 
commemorate some key events, such as the birthday of Kim Jong-il on 16 February, the 
centennial birthday of Kim Il-Sung on 16 April, and the celebration of the anniversary of 
the founding of the Korean Workers&#8217; Party on 10 October. These are important dates that 
could provide the opportunity for general amnesties to be granted to certain categories of 
prisoners (see paragraphs 39 and 40 below).  
</p>
<p><b> A. Separated families and family reunions 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur notes with regret that the talks between the Red Cross 
societies of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, which 
have taken the lead in facilitating family visits of separated Korean families, have been 
stalled since November 2010, in the wake of the artillery firing on Yeonpyeong Island.  </p>


<p>17. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that, despite more than 150 rounds of talks 
between the Red Cross societies of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea since 1971, the outcome of the talks has been minimal. To date, the two 
societies have managed to organize only 18 rounds of family reunions over a period of 12 
years, the last one being held in October 2010. The number of families in the Republic of 
Korea who have benefitted from the family reunion programme stands at 1,800 out of a 
total 128,668 registered applicants.  
</p>
<p>18. According to the database of the Government of the Republic of Korea, in 2011, the 
number of elderly citizens of the Republic of Korea seeking to meet relatives in the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea fell to 78,892, as against 82,447 in 2010. This state 
of affairs underscores the urgency of resuming the reunions of family members separated 
by the Korean War of 1950-1953. The drop in number of families seeking family visits is 
due to the death of separated family members, who are growing increasingly elderly. 
</p>
<p>19. Another survey carried out in December 2011 of more than 66,600 surviving 
separated family members showed that 43.8 per cent of them were aged 80 years or over, 
37.3 per cent were in their seventies and 13.6 per cent were in their sixties. In the light of 
these developments, the Special Rapporteur urges that the two Red Cross societies to adopt 
a three-step approach of (a) tracing all separated families and notifying their counterparts; 
(b) facilitating the exchange of mail among separated Korean families whose whereabouts 
have been identified; and (c) arranging meetings and mutual visits among them. The 
Special Rapporteur believes that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), 
which has been involved in family tracing around the world, could be a valuable partner in 
sharing experiences with the Red Cross societies of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea and the Republic of Korea. This could not only be helpful in developing new ways of 
tracing families, but also to provide much needed attention to the subject of tracing Korean 
family members. The Special Rapporteur recognizes that an absolute replication of all 
forms of family tracing adopted by ICRC could be challenging in the context of separated 
families in the Korean peninsula, as certain modalities would require the affected families 
to have access to the Internet, which is lacking in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea.    
</p>
<p>20. In the interest of separated families, the Special Rapporteur urges the resumption of 
the family reunion process and calls for a more robust mechanism of family reunions in the 
months and years ahead.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Food and economic situation and its impact on the right to food 
</b></p>
<p>21. In recent years, chronic shortage of food has become one of the most pressing issues 
in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, a topic that the previous and the current 
mandate holders have constantly focused on, in view of its impact on the people and the 
crucial importance that the right to adequate food has for the enjoyment of a number of 
other rights.  
</p>
<p>22. In March 2011, a United Nations survey found that, in the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea, more than 6 million vulnerable people urgently required international 
food assistance. Following the survey, an assessment mission was jointly conducted by the 
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and WFP in October 
</p><p>2011. On the basis of the mission, a report on the current food situation in the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea was released in November 2011. In the country, the State-run 
public distribution system remains the primary source through which food is delivered. In 
2011, given that for prolonged periods time the system only provided around one-third of 
daily energy requirements, households were forced to seek food from other sources. </p>


<p>Notably, relatives living on cooperative farms in rural areas gave up portions of their own 
food allocations to assist people dependent on the distribution system in urban areas.  
</p>
<p>23. The above-mentioned FAO/WFP report showed that many of the factors behind the 
shortage of food in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea remain the same in 2012, 
but have intensified; these include the adverse weather conditions, underdevelopment and 
structural problems, which have all had a serious impact on food and crop production in 
2010/11.  
</p>
<p>24. In 2012, it is estimated that, while harvests in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea are expected to increase by about 8.5 per cent over the results of the previous year, 
the country would still have to import 739,000 tons of cereal. Considering the planned 
Government imports of 325,000 tons, the WFP/FAO mission estimates an uncovered food 
deficit of 414,000 tons. In the 2011/12 marketing year, substantial increases in commercial 
imports and/or external assistance will be needed to make up for the deficit. The alarming 
deterioration in the availability of food is also affected by the decline in bilateral and 
multilateral food aid from the international community. The country&#8217;s planned commercial 
imports and recommended food assistance will not cover the food deficit, leaving an 
additional shortfall of 294,000 tons of cereals.  
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the current dire food shortage in the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea will lead to serious health problems, especially in 
children, women and the elderly. In 2011, health officials in the country reported a 50 to 
100 per cent increase over the total in 2010 in admissions of malnourished children into 
paediatric wards. In addition, a sharp rise in low birth weights, and several cases of 
oedema1 were noted. Other vulnerable groups are pregnant and lactating women, who are at 
greater risk of acute malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies.  
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur underscores the importance of meeting the food shortfall by 
ensuring that an adequate quantity of food of good quality is available through additional 
imports by the Government, supported by the international agencies and bilateral donors. 
The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that the primary obligation to feed people lies with the 
State, which must take all measures necessary to rectify existing flaws in the production 
and distribution system that have contributed for the shortage of food. He also calls on the 
Government to allocate more resources to agriculture rather than to  its military sector.  
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur also wishes to highlight the fact that members of the 
international community have both a joint and individual responsibility to provide 
humanitarian assistance in times of emergency. States should refrain at all times from food 
embargoes or similar measures that endanger conditions for food production and access to 
food in other countries. Food should never be used as an instrument of political and 
economic pressure.2 He calls on donor countries, including non-traditional donor countries, 
to provide humanitarian aid, such as food and medicines. 
</p>
<p>28. In October 2011, WFP distributed food, funded by an &#8364;8.5 million donation from the 
Humanitarian Aid Office of the European Commission, for its emergency operation to 
reach mainly young children and women threatened by rising malnutrition.3 More recently, 
China reportedly assisted the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea with 500,000 tons of

<p>food and 250,000 tons of crude oil,4 while eight representatives of the Seoul-based Korea 
Peace Foundation delivered 180 tons of flour to Kaesong on 27 January 2012.5 The Special 
Rapporteur welcomes these contributions and calls on other States to join the efforts to 
solve the food shortage in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. 
</p>
<p>29. In order to recommend certain concrete steps to improve the situation of the right to 
food in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, the Special Rapporteur urges the 
authorities of that country to invite the Special Rapporteur on the right to food for an 
official visit. Such an invitation to visit the country would, inter alia, help the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to food to make recommendations on how to rectify food 
production and distribution mechanisms and on ways to increase food production. A 
request to visit the country by the Special Rapporteur on the right to food was forwarded to 
the authorities in 2009.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Due process of law  
</b></p>
<p>30. A number of constitutional and legislative provisions seriously endanger the 
impartiality and independence of the judiciary in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea. The Human Rights Committee, during its review of the country in 2001, raised 
concerns with regard to article 10 of the Criminal Code, pursuant to which punishment for 
an offence not provided for in the Code could be imposed in accordance with those 
provisions of the Code punishing offences similar in nature and gravity. The Committee 
found that the article was incompatible with the concept of <i>nullum crimen sine lege</i>,6 
enshrined in article 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.7  
</p>
<p>31. In 2004, the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea revised its Criminal Code, 
deleting provisions that allowed for analogical interpretations, and accommodated the 
principle of <i>nullum crimen sine lege</i>. It also provided more clarity on a number of other 
crimes and removed terms such as &#8220;etc.&#8221; and &#8220;like&#8221;, which could have given scope for 
ambiguous interpretation. The revision instead described acts that would constitute various 
types of criminal behaviour and provided more clarity. The number of articles in the 
Criminal Code consequently increased from 118 to 245, with more specific definitions of 
the elements of crimes.8 The Special Rapporteur welcomes such initiatives.  
</p>
<p>32. As the court system currently stands in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, 
the Central Court is accountable to the Supreme People&#8217;s Assembly, pursuant to article 162 
of the Criminal Code. Furthermore, article 129 of the Criminal Code subjects judges to 
criminal liability for handing down &#8220;unjust judgements&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur is

<p>concerned that such provisions have an adverse impact on the protection of human rights 
guaranteed under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and endanger the 
independence of the judiciary. Furthermore, he believes that the need to maintain the 
separation of powers, as required by article 14.1 of the Covenant,9 is also compromised, 
seriously jeopardizing the rendering of independent and impartial justice. It is important to 
protect judges against conflicts of interests and intimidations in order to safeguard their 
independence.  
</p>
<p>33. In the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, both open court and closed court 
trials are practised. In general, there seems to be a lack of understanding among the people 
of why the open court principle is essential for the fairness of trails. In 2004, when the State 
revised its Criminal Procedure Code, it introduced a new provision requiring court trials to 
be open to the public (art. 271, sect. 1). The revised law contains, however, an exception, 
allowing certain trials to be conducted behind closed doors, if necessary to protect State 
secrets or if opening the trial to the public could have an adverse impact on society at large 
(art. 271, sect. 2). In practice, this means that ordinary citizens are tried in open courts and 
officials and party cadres are tried in closed ones. The Special Rapporteur recalls that 
article 14, paragraph 1, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
proclaims that courts have the power to exclude all of part of the public for reasons of 
morals, public order or national security, or when the interest of the lives of the parties so 
required, or in special circumstances where publicity would be prejudicial to the interest of 
justice.10 Any other form of exception limiting open trials to a particular category of 
persons, such as in the case of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, where officials 
and party cadres are tried in closed courts, is unacceptable. The Special Rapporteur 
furthermore points out that, even in cases where the public is excluded from the trial, the 
judgement, including the essential findings, evidence and legal reasoning must be made 
public, except where the interest of juvenile persons requires otherwise, or when the 
proceedings concern matrimonial disputes or the guardianship of children.11  
</p>
<p>34. A number of other provisions in the Criminal Code fall below the standard required 
to ensure that due process of law is maintained and the rights of people are respected; for 
instance, the definition of &#8220;labour training&#8221; and &#8220;training detention facilities&#8221; remains 
unclear; the possibility of a broad interpretation of the category of &#8220;political crime&#8221; 
remains; and elements such as &#8220;crimes by association&#8221; are maintained in several parts of 
the Criminal Code. Similar vague terms, such as &#8220;extremely grave crime&#8221; and &#8220;reform 
through labour&#8221;, are contained in an addendum to the Criminal Code, which was adopted 
on 19 December 2007 (see paragraphs 36 and 37 below). 
</p>
<p><b> D. Laws on the death penalty  
</b></p>
<p>35. In February 1987, the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea made significant 
revisions to its Criminal Code, when it reduced the number of crimes punishable by death 
from 33 to five.12 Additional partial revisions have since been made on at least seven 
occasions: in March 1995, on 19 April and 26 July 2005, on 4 April and 18 October 2006, 
and 26 June and 16 October 2007. In April 2009, the State made another important

 11  Ibid.  
 12 CCPR/C/PRK/2000/2.  </p>


<p>amendment to its Criminal Code, when it expanded the list of crimes punishable by death 
from five to six by adding &#8220;treacherous (disloyal) destruction&#8221; (art. 64).13  
</p>
<p>36. On 19 December 2007, the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea adopted a 
unique form of law, referred to as an &#8220;addendum to the Criminal Code for ordinary crimes&#8221;, 
which has gone largely unnoticed by the international community. The addendum is a very 
significant legislative act, given that was formally adopted by the Presidium of the Supreme 
People&#8217;s Assembly as a Government directive. Since its adoption, the addendum has 
functioned as a complement to the Penal Code, and carried the same weight as other 
provisions of the Criminal Code. The addendum comprises a total of 23 articles, of which 
16 stipulate the death penalty for a number of crimes,14 including smuggling and dealing in 
narcotics, seizing State property, currency counterfeiting and illicitly selling State 
resources. With the adoption of the addendum, the total number of crimes that carry the 
death penalty in the country stands at 22. Furthermore, the addendum contains a number of 
vague expressions, such as &#8220;the gravest cases&#8221; or &#8220;extremely serious cases&#8221;, which leave 
room for arbitrary decisions by the authorities. The addendum permits the application of 
capital punishment for various crimes as long as the authorities are able to establish that the 
crime in question was &#8220;extremely serious&#8221; and falls under one of the 16 listed crimes.  
</p>
<p>37. It is important to note that the above-mentioned addendum was not considered 
during the universal periodic review of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, and no 
reference was made to it in stakeholders&#8217; submissions or the State party report. It is likely 
that the addendum was not known to stakeholders, which again highlights the need for the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to interact more with international human rights 
organizations and their access to the country.   
</p>
<p>38. Reports of execution continued to be shared with the Special Rapporteur; as many as 
20 such executions were reported to have been carried out in 2011 alone. Some of the 
reasons for executions include drug trafficking, murder, sexual assault, espionage and 
large-scale distribution of information material from overseas.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Provisions for amnesties  
</b></p>
<p>39. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea has a system that envisages special and 
general amnesties: special amnesties may be granted to individual criminals, while general 
amnesties may be granted to all criminals serving a sentence for a certain category of crime. 
In 2009, when the Constitution was revised, the State included a section that authorized the 
Chairman of the National Defence Commission to grant special amnesties, while the power 
to grant general amnesties was conferred upon the Standing Committee (Presidium) of the 
</p>
<p>  
 13 When the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea was reviewed in the context of the universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review ,in 2009, the Government stated that capital punishment was handed down only in the 
case of five categories of extremely serious crime; this would suggest the amendments made in 
2009were probably enacted after the submission of the State party report.  
</p>
<p> 14  The crimes listed in the addendum that are punishable by death include &#8220;severe acts of wilful 
destruction of military facilities and technical combat equipment&#8221;, &#8220;severe acts of plundering of State 
property&#8221;, &#8220;severe acts of theft of State property&#8221;, &#8220;severe acts of wilful destruction or State 
</p>
<p>property&#8221;, &#8220;severe acts of engraving or printing counterfeit currency&#8221;, &#8220;severe acts of smuggling or 
</p>
<p>black market sales of precious metals or metals&#8221;, &#8220;severe acts of smuggling State resources&#8221;, &#8220;severe 
acts of smuggling or black market dealing in narcotics&#8221;, &#8220;extreme instances of prisoner escape&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>&#8220;extreme instances of gangster-like behaviour&#8221;, &#8220;unlawful business operations&#8221;, &#8220;extreme instances 
of deliberate infliction of serious injury&#8221;, &#8220;severe acts of kidnapping&#8221;, &#8220;severe acts of rape&#8221;, &#8220;severe 
</p>
<p>acts of theft of private property&#8221; and other exceptional crimes subject to an unlimited term of 
</p>
<p>correctional labour or the death sentence.  </p>


<p>Supreme People&#8217;s Assembly (art. 103, sect. 5; art. 116, sect. 17; and Criminal Code art. 53). 
Past practices show that general amnesties are usually granted on special occasions, such as 
during the founding anniversary of the Korean Workers&#8217; Party. &#8220;Grand amnesties&#8221; are 
</p>
<p>granted on predetermined dates, such as the birthdays of Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-il, the 
anniversary of the Party or of the founding of the Republic.  
</p>
<p>40. In 2008, in commemoration of the sixtieth anniversary of the founding of the 
Republic, the State announced a general amnesty and released or reduced the terms of 
imprisonment of inmates serving correctional punishments. Contrary to earlier 
expectations, however, the scope of amnesty was significantly reduced, and those serving 
sentences for attempting to leave the State by border-crossing were not included in the 
amnesty. In January 2011, as a part of the national festivities to celebrate the seventieth 
birthday of Kim Jong-il and the one-hundredth anniversary of the birth of Kim Il-sung, the 
State announced that a general amnesty would be granted; however, the announcement 
neither clarified the number of prisoners nor provided information on the profile of those 
who would benefit from the amnesty. The Special Rapporteur calls on the authorities of the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to make use of the important forthcoming 
anniversary to maximize amnesties, pardons and sentence reductions to include political 
prisoners among those released, and to be transparent about the number of such prisoners.      
</p>
<p><b> F. Abduction of foreign nationals 
</b></p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that there no progress has been made in 
resolving the question of abduction of foreign nationals by agents of the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. To date , some 500 unresolved cases of abduction of Koreans 
from the Republic of Korea have been reported. These abductions were carried out 
following the ceasefire at the end of the Korean War.  
</p>
<p>42. With regard to the abduction of Japanese nationals, the reinvestigation of 12 cases is 
still pending. During his mission to Japan, the Special Rapporteur visited Niigata and 
Kashiwazaki, where he was given a thorough briefing by the Niigata prefectural police on 
the abduction of Megumi Yokota, Kaoru Hasuike and Yukiko Hasuike. Detailed accounts 
of the abduction of the three Japanese nationals on 15 November 1977 and 31 July 1978 
were provided to the Special Rapporteur. While Mr. Hasuike and Mr. Hasuike were 
returned to Japan in October 2002, there has been practically no progress made in 
relaunching a full-scale investigation into the abduction of Mr. Yokota and of 11 other 
Japanese nationals. The launch of a full-scale investigation was promised by the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea during its  working level talks with Japan on 
abductions held in August 2008. The Special Rapporteur wishes to reiterate his position 
that the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea should stand by its commitment made to 
Japan to reinvestigate the 12 pending cases of abduction. The urgency of the matter is clear, 
the abductees are aging, as are their family members in Japan. In this regard, it is important 
that pressure be maintained on the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea until such time 
as a satisfactory outcome has been achieved.  
</p>
<p>43. The cases of abduction of nationals of other countries, such as Thailand and 
Lebanon, remain unresolved.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Case of Oh Kil-nam  
</b></p>
<p>44. During his mission to the Republic of Korea, the Special Rapporteur was briefed 
about the case of Dr. Oh Kil-nam. Dr. Kil-nam and his family were persuaded by agents of 
the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to move to that country from West Germany, </p>


<p>where he resided, in December 1985. In 1986, Dr. Kil-nam left the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea on the pretext of bringing more citizens of the Republic of Korea from 
West Germany. However, he left his wife and two daughters in the country, and they have 
since been held hostage by the State. In 1992, Dr. Kil-nam returned to the Republic of 
Korea and began to campaign for the return of his family to his country of origin.  
</p>
<p>45. Since his return to Republic of Korea, Dr. Kil-nam has met five asylum-seekers 
from the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea who claim to have seen his wife and 
children in Yodok prison camp. The last available information on the whereabouts of his 
family dates from 1995. In 1994, his family&#8217;s case was taken up by the Secretary-General 
of Amnesty International, who raised the issue with the authorities of the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. However, no progress has been made towards the release of 
the family or gaining access to the family members.  
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the case has been unresolved for a number 
of years. He calls on the authorities of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to 
release Dr. Kil-nam&#8217;s family members immediately and to facilitate their reunion with Dr. 
Kil-nam.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Protection of asylum-seekers 
</b></p>
<p>47. There has been a steady increase in the number of persons seeking refuge in the 
Republic of Korea. Until the late 1990s, fewer than 1,000 asylum-seekers from the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea had made their way to the Republic of Korea. By 
the end of 2012, there were around 23,700 asylum-seekers in the Republic of Korea. Of 
these arrivals, around 75 per cent are women (which has been more or less the case for the 
past five or six years). One plausible explanation provided for proportionally high number 
of women asylum-seekers  is that women have more mobility in the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea, while men are expected to be at work or to look for work. In 2011, an 
increase of 17 per cent in the number of arrivals to the Republic of Korea was recorded 
over the figures for the previous year.  
</p>
<p>48. As in the previous year, the Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to visit the 
Hanawon centre, a Government-supported reception point for newly arrived asylum-
seekers from the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. The increase in the number of 
asylum-seekers into the Republic of Korea has prompted the authorities in that country  to 
build a new centre that could accommodate an additional 500 asylum-seekers at any given 
time. At Hanawon, the Special Rapporteur interacted with a number of asylum-seekers who 
had endured various types of harrowing experience in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea. Most of the asylum-seekers with whom he spoke had undergone harsh punishment 
in forced labour camps, had either witnessed or heard of torture being used on other 
inmates, and suffered punishment on the basis of &#8220;guilt by association&#8221;. The Special 
Rapporteur also heard with concern the increase in the number of neighbourhood social 
squads or &#8220;minders&#8221;, as they were commonly referred to. While some asylum-seekers 
manage to finally make their way to the Republic of Korea, numerous others are forcibly 
returned to the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea by the neighbouring country.  
</p>
<p>49. During the visit, a number of non-governmental organizations and diplomats raised 
serious concerns about the refoulement of asylum-seekers. It was reported that border 
controls were tightened in 2011, making access to international protection more difficult. It 
was also reported that orders to shoot and kill those fleeing the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea had been issued by the authorities. Some interlocutors also reported that 
fleeing asylum-seekers had been shot and killed by troops of the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea. Such tightened border controls have forced asylum-seekers to take the 
sea route to Japan or the Republic of Korea. Statistics show that, in 2011, 47 people, on </p>


<p>seven boats, arrived by sea, compared with only nine people, on five boats, in 2010. The 
Special Rapporteur was informed that the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea has 
increased coast patrols as a result of this development.  
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur shares deeply the concerns raised with him by civil society 
organizations and the diplomatic community, and calls on States to adhere to their 
obligation of providing international protection to such asylum-seekers.  
</p>
<p>51. In 2013, when the Special Rapporteur reports back to the Human Rights Council, 
the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea will be preparing for its next review in the 
context of the universal periodic review. Although the Government did not clarify which 
universal periodic review recommendations it supported, the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic 
of Korea will be expected to report on the implementation of some of the recommendations 
and conclusions. The Special Rapporteur hopes that the Government will use the time up 
until early 2014 to make a detailed assessment of the extent to which it has implemented 
the recommendations made. He again encourages the Government to engage with the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in this process and to 
seek its technical expertise.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>52.<b> The Special Rapporteur wishes to emphasise the need for the Democratic 
</b>People&#8217;s Republi<b>c of Korea to ensure the overall protection and promotion of human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights in the country, as provided under international human rights instruments.  
</b></p>
<p>53.<b> The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government of the </b>Democratic People&#8217;s 
<b>Republic of Korea</b> <b>to cooperate with the various United Nations human rights 
mechanisms. He also calls on the Government to implement the recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>made by various human rights mechanisms, as well as made in the reports of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Secretary-General and of the Special Rapporteur to the General Assembly and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights Council.  
</b></p>
<p>54.<b> The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to repeal provisions in its 
legislation that are counter to the international standards. In particular, he draws the 
</b></p>
<p><b>attention of the Government to the provisions to which he has referred in the present 
</b></p>
<p><b>report.  
</b></p>
<p>55.<b> The Special Rapporteur recognizes the paramount importance of resuming 
inter-Korean dialogue in order to create a conducive atmosphere, which could then 
</b></p>
<p><b>lead to the resolution of a number of outstanding issues, such as the reunion of 
</b></p>
<p><b>separated families and the repatriation of abducted Koreans.  
</b></p>
<p>56.<b> With regard to the 12 abducted Japanese nationals, the Special Rapporteur 
stresses the need for the </b>Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea <b>to stand by its 
commitment made to Japan to re-investigate the 12 pending cases of abduction.  
</b></p>
<p>57.<b> The Special Rapporteur calls on the governments of the </b>Democratic People&#8217;s 
<b>Republic of Korea</b> <b>and the Republic of Korea to explore the possibility of setting up of 
an additional mechanism that could be more robust than the current process for 
</b></p>
<p><b>addressing the problem of separated families.  
</b></p>
<p>58.<b> While calling on the </b>Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea <b>to invest more 
resources in its agriculture sector and to take corrective measures to increase food 
</b></p>
<p><b>production in the country, the Special Rapporteur stresses the need for the revival of 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective humanitarian assistance by the international community to the people of the 
</b></p>
<p>Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea<b>. Provisions of such humanitarian aid, </b></p>


<p><b>including food and medicine, while subject to </b>&#8220;<b>no access, no aid</b>&#8221;<b> policies, should not 
</b></p>
<p><b>be made contingent upon any political requirements.  
</b></p>
<p>59.<b> While commending the Republic of Korea and Japan for their integration of 
asylum-seekers from the </b>Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea<b>, with scope for 
</b></p>
<p><b>improvement, the Special Rapporteur calls on other neighbouring countries to protect 
</b></p>
<p><b>and treat all people fleeing the </b>Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea <b>humanely and 
to respect the principle of non-refoulement, as provided for under the Convention 
</b></p>
<p><b>relating to the Status of Refugees.
