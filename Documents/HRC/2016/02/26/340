<p><b>Human Rights Council 
Twenty-ninth session 
</b></p>
<p>Agenda item 3 
</p>
<p><b>Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council on 2 July 2015 
</b></p>
<p><b>  29/15. Human rights and climate change 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the Charter of the United Nations, and reaffirming the Universal 
</p>
<p>Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
</p>
<p>Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Vienna Declaration 
</p>
<p>and Programme of Action, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> all its previous resolutions on human rights and climate change, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 
</p>
<p>objectives and principles thereof, and emphasizing that parties should, in all climate 
</p>
<p>change-related actions, fully respect human rights as enunciated in the outcome of the 
</p>
<p>sixteenth session of the Conference of Parties to the Convention,<footnote name="1">FCCC/CP/2010/7/Add.1, dec.1/CP.16.  </footnote> 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> the commitment to enable the full, effective and sustained 
</p>
<p>implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change through 
</p>
<p>long-term cooperative action, in order to achieve the ultimate objective of the Convention, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> that, as stated in the United Nations Framework Convention on 
</p>
<p>Climate Change, the global nature of climate change calls for the widest possible 
</p>
<p>cooperation by all countries and their participation in an effective and appropriate 
</p>
<p>international response, in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities 
</p>
<p>and respective capabilities and their social and economic conditions, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> <i>also</i> that, as stated in the United Nations Framework Convention on 
</p>
<p>Climate Change, responses to climate change should be coordinated with social and 
</p>
<p>economic development in an integrated manner with a view to avoiding adverse impact on 
</p>
<p>the latter, taking into full account the legitimate priority needs of developing countries for 
</p>
<p>the achievement of sustained economic growth and the eradication of poverty, 
</p>
<p><i>Affirming</i> that human rights obligations, standards and principles have the potential 
</p>
<p>to inform and strengthen international, regional and national policymaking in the area of 
</p>
<p>climate change, promoting policy coherence, legitimacy and sustainable outcomes, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that the adverse effects of climate change have a range of implications, 
</p>
<p>both direct and indirect, for the effective enjoyment of human rights, inter alia, the right to 
</p>
<p>life, the right to adequate food, the right to the enjoyment of highest attainable standard of 
</p>
<p>physical and mental health, the right to adequate housing, the right to self-determination, 
</p>
<p>the right to safe drinking water and sanitation and the right to development, and recalling 
</p>
<p>that in no case may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing concern</i> that, while these implications affect individuals and 
</p>
<p>communities around the world, the adverse effects of climate change are felt most acutely 
</p>
<p>by those segments of the population that are already in vulnerable situations owing to 
</p>
<p>factors such as geography, poverty, gender, age, indigenous or minority status, national or 
</p>
<p>social origin, birth or other status and disability, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing concern also</i> that countries lacking the resources for implementing their 
</p>
<p>adaptation plans and programmes of action and effective adaptation strategies may suffer 
</p>
<p>from higher exposure to extreme weather events, in both rural and urban areas, particularly 
</p>
<p>in developing countries, including those in least developed countries, small island 
</p>
<p>developing States and African countries with more climate vulnerability, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the particular vulnerabilities of non-nationals who may face challenges 
</p>
<p>associated with implementing appropriate responses in extreme weather conditions owing 
</p>
<p>to their status and who may have limited access to information and services, resulting in 
</p>
<p>barriers to the full enjoyment of their human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Affirming</i> the commitment to enhance action on adaptation under the Cancun 
</p>
<p>Adaptation Framework and to implement further the Nairobi Work Programme of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the holding of the twenty-first Conference of the Parties to the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in December 2015, in Paris, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> the importance of facilitating meaningful interaction between the human 
</p>
<p>rights and climate change communities in order to build capacity to deliver responses to 
</p>
<p>climate change, as outlined in the Geneva Pledge for Human Rights in Climate Action, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting also</i> the establishment and the advocacy of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Expresses concern</i> that climate change has contributed to the increase of both 
</p>
<p>sudden-onset natural disasters and slow-onset events, and that these events have adverse 
</p>
<p>effects on the full enjoyment of all human rights; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Emphasizes</i> the urgent importance of continuing to address, as they relate to 
</p>
<p>States&#8217; human rights obligations, the adverse consequences of climate change for all, 
</p>
<p>particularly in developing countries and the people whose situation is most vulnerable to 
</p>
<p>climate change, especially those in a situation of extreme poverty, and deteriorating 
</p>
<p>livelihood conditions; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Decides</i> to incorporate into its programme of work for the thirty-first session, 
</p>
<p>on the basis of the different elements contained in the present resolution, a panel discussion 
</p>
<p>on the adverse impact of climate change on States&#8217; efforts to progressively realize the right 
</p>
<p>of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
</p>
<p>health and related policies, lessons learned and good practices; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights, in consultation with and taking into account the views of States, the special 
</p>
<p>procedures of the Human Rights Council, the World Health Organization and other relevant 
</p>
<p>international organizations and intergovernmental bodies, including the Intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>Panel on Climate Change and the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention 
</p>
<p>on Climate Change, and other stakeholders, to conduct, from within existing resources, a </p>


<p>detailed analytical study on the relationship between climate change and the human right of 
</p>
<p>everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health 
</p>
<p>to be submitted to the Council prior to its thirty-first session and with a view to informing 
</p>
<p>the panel discussion mandated in paragraph 3 above; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Also</i> <i>requests </i>the Office of the High Commissioner to submit to the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council, at its session following the panel discussion, a summary report, including 
</p>
<p>any recommendations stemming therefrom, for consideration of further follow-up action; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Invites</i> the special procedures mandate holders, within their respective 
</p>
<p>mandates, and other relevant stakeholders, including academic experts and civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations, to contribute actively to the panel discussion; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Encourages</i> relevant special procedures mandate holders to continue to 
</p>
<p>consider the issue of climate change and human rights within their respective mandates; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Decides</i> to consider the possibility of organizing follow-up events on climate 
</p>
<p>change and human rights within its future programme of work; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner to provide all the 
</p>
<p>human and technical assistance necessary for the effective and timely realization of the 
</p>
<p>above-mentioned panel discussion, the summary report thereon, and the analytical study; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Decides</i> to remain seized of the matter.
