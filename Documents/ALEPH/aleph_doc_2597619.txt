CI RESOURCES LIMITED 
 
Chairman’s Letter 
 
 
I am pleased to be able to report a very positive result for CI Resources Limited (Company). The Company has 
recorded a substantial profit for the year of $34 million after tax. 
 
DIVIDENDS 
 
The Board has approved a continuation of our dividend policy by confirming a final fully franked dividend of 5 
cents,  and  in  view  of  the  very  strong  results  the  Board  has  approved  a  “special  dividend”  of  a  further  fully 
franked 3 cents per share. The record date for the total fully franked dividend payment of 8 cents per share is the 
26th September 2016 with payment to be made on 24th October 2016. 
 
Our shares have recorded a 111% growth in the market sales price to the 30th June 2016 and the total of 9 cents 
in  fully  franked  dividends  paid  in  the  financial  year  amounts  to  an  effective  dividend  yield  of  3.86%  on  the 
closing market price at the end of the financial year. 
 
 
MARKET CONDITIONS
Overall the global economy remains subdued and this, coupled  with abnormal climatic  conditions, is likely to 
have an impact on our future returns.   
 
Demand is weaker and the downward trend of prices has increased. Falling shipping costs have enabled low cost 
phosphate producers from outside our region to enter our market region increasing the price competition in it. 
 
Abnormally  high  rainfall  over  the  past  few  months  on  Christmas  Island  has  also  impacted  on  our  production 
targets. The Managing Director has initiated a program of productivity and efficiency improvements which aims 
to mitigate some of these negative trends. 
 
Unfortunately abnormally dry  weather in peninsular Malaysia has impacted palm oil production in that region 
and  this  together  with  lower  global  prices  has  resulted  in  lower  profitability  for  producers  including  our 
Cheekah Kemayan plantation.   
 
The Board remains confident that  we  will  weather any temporary difficulties that  may arise and on a positive 
note,  the  Board  anticipates  that  the  current  gloomy  outlook  will  generate  opportunities  for  further  strategic 
investments and growth at realistic entry prices. 
 
 
DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY
The  Board  has  determined  to  continue  pursuing  investments  in  accord  with  its  current  "diversified  industrial" 
strategy - in the sectors of phosphate, mining, infrastructure and land development, and agriculture.
Despite  the  delays  referred  to  by  the  Managing  Director  we  will  also  continue  with  our  push  to  extend  our 
access to additional mining areas on vacant Crown Land outside the National Park on Christmas Island. As we 
noted  last  year,  we  consider  an  ongoing  viable  mining  operation  as  essential  to  provide  the  underpinning  for 
programmes designed to preserve the unique island ecology particularly given the stringent budget parameters 
facing the Commonwealth Government.   
 
The  Board  has  approved  the  continuation  of  the  research  programme  with  Murdoch  University  to  establish 
whether  any  boutique  alternative  agricultural  industry,  including  medicinal  cannabis,  would  be  commercially 
viable on Christmas Island.

Chairman’s Letter 
 
 
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 
 
The Board of the Company is satisfied that the Company has a very sound financial underpinning as reflected in 
the published balance sheet and will continue to perform positively.  
 
The sound financial base coupled with a competent and flexible management team ensures that we will be able 
to consider and implement growth strategies and undertake complementary growth investments as opportunities 
arise. 
 
I finally take this opportunity on behalf of the Board to thank our employees, managers and executives for their 
contributions to a successful outcome for the year.

CI RESOURCES LIMITED 
 
Managing Director’s Report 
 
 
It is with pleasure that I table the CI Resources Ltd Annual Report for the financial year ending 30 June 2016.  
 
 
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PRODUCTION OVERVIEW  
 
The  Consolidated  result  was  recorded  as  a  profit  after  tax  for  FY  2016  of  some  $34  million  with  an  after  tax 
profit from mining alone of some $27 million.  
 
Christmas Island operations maintained its output which was a credible result given the impact of unseasonal 
heavy rainfall in the last quarter at double the normal average for those months. Coupled with external trading 
the group sales of phosphate products reached 770,000 tonnes.  
 
 
GROUP DEVELOPMENTS  
 
Both Indian Ocean Oil Company Pty Ltd and CI Maintenance Services Pty Ltd, wholly owned subsidiaries of 
Phosphate Resources Ltd, who provide services largely to Commonwealth entities on Christmas Island have 
made useful contributions to the consolidated results of the Group. 
 
Our Singapore and Malaysian subsidiaries have expanded their trading activities and profitability. In particular, 
the development of warehouse capacity in Malaysia has improved the level of service we can provide to our 
customers.  
 
 
RESOURCES AND PROJECTS 
   
As  we  reported  last  year,  we  have  identified  some  limited  additional  areas  outside  the  National  Park  on 
Christmas Island which may contain sufficient resource to enable us to sustain operations at current levels in the 
medium term if we were granted access to them. 
 
However, regulatory hurdles have been raised by the Commonwealth bureaucracy which have to date precluded 
us from accessing vacant crown land outside the National Park for even some minimal exploration drilling. This 
has  impeded  the  orderly  evaluation  of  any  additional  phosphate  resources  that  may  exist  on  the  Island  and 
delayed any decision to make an application for access to these additional limited areas of resource.    
 
Despite  these  delays,  we  have  commenced  a  major  environmental  review  of  the  pockets  of  land  we  are 
considering. This  will enable  us  to be satisfied that there is no scientific basis  for an environmental refusal  to 
grant approval to mine before any application is lodged. 
 
To ensure long term viability and ongoing returns for shareholders we will continue to actively evaluate other 
investment  prospects  on  Christmas  Island  and  elsewhere.  We  hope  to  expand  the  coverage  of  our  service 
subsidiaries.  If  appropriate  investment  returns  are  identified  we  are  also  prepared  to  increase  our  presence  in 
both  the  phosphate  /  fertiliser  and/or  palm  oil  sectors.  To  effect  this,  we  have  increased  our  resources  and 
allocation for business development as we look to build on the collective expertise and experience contained in 
the company to grow our overall operations.  
 
 
THE YEAR AHEAD 
 
The Chairman has outlined the depressed market conditions we are facing.  
 
In order to meet the market challenge and retain a reasonable level of ongoing profitability we have commenced 
a  major  review  of  our  production  processes  aiming  to  maximise  the  efficient  use  of  personnel,  plant  and 
equipment capacity and increase the overall productivity and output in our Christmas Island operations.    
 
We  will continue  to try and  work constructively  with the  Commonwealth  government  towards achieving long 
overdue  improvements  in  both  road  and  port  infrastructure.  These  areas  impact  on  our  current  operational

viability  but  improvement  is  also  essential  if  any  alternative  economic  development  is  to  be  undertaken  on 
Christmas Island. 
 
In closing I would thank the Board members and my senior managers and employees for their continued efforts 
and support.

Directors’ report 
 
Likely developments and expected results
Based on the current commercial and legislative parameters we are confident that there are sufficient indicated 
resources  available  to  sustain  a  viable  mining  operation  for  at  least  a  further  five  years  and  that  the  palm  oil 
business will continue to provide reasonable returns for the forseeable future.
The Directors note that current strategies suggest that the  2016 financial  year  will see the Consolidated Entity 
remain profitable.
Additional  information  on  likely  developments  in  the  operations  of  the  consolidated  entity  and  the  expected 
results of those operations have not been included in this report because the Directors believe that it would be 
likely to result in unreasonable prejudice to the Company.
Environmental regulation and performance
The Consolidated Entity’s  holds various licenses regulating its  mining and exploration  activities on  Christmas 
Island  and  also  holds  environmental  licences  from  the  operation  of  a  palm  oil  mill  issued  by  Malaysian 
Government.
Licenses issued by the Commonwealth Government of Australia and Malaysian Government include general 
environmental  conditions,  air  pollution  control  conditions  and  water  control  conditions.    These  conditions 
regulate  the  management  of  mining  waste  and  restoration,  dust,  liquid  chemical  storage,  and  water 
monitoring. 
 
There have been no significant known breaches of the Consolidated Entity’s licenses.   
 
 
Shares options

D 
E  Additional information  
 
The information in this section has been audited as required by section 308(3c) of the Corporations Act 2001. 
 
A  Principles used to determine the nature and amount of remuneration  
 
In order to maintain and attract directors to facilitate the efficient and effective management of the Consolidated 
Entity’s operations, the board established a Remuneration and Nominations Committee on 9 March 2015 which 
reviews the remuneration of directors on an annual basis and makes recommendations to the Board. 
 
Aside from the discretionary bonus disclosed in the remuneration report, no other link exists, at this stage in the 
Company’s development, between financial performance, shareholder wealth and the remuneration of Directors 
and Key Management Personnel. 
 
Non-executive directors 
Fees and payments to non-executive directors reflect the demands which are made on, and the responsibilities of 
the  directors.    Non-executive  directors’  fees  and  payments  are  reviewed  annually  by  the  Remuneration  & 
Nominations Committee and the committee makes recommendations to the Board.  The Board also ensures non-
executive directors’ fees and payments are appropriate and in line with the market as determined by comparison 
with  companies  of  a  similar  size.    The  Chairman’s  fees  are  determined  independently  to  the  fees  of  non-
executive  directors  based  on  comparative  roles  in  the  external  market.    The  Chairman  is  not  present  at  any 
discussions relating to determination of his own remuneration.   
 
Directors’ fees 
The  current  base  remuneration  was  last  reviewed  on  23  June  2016.    Directors’  remuneration  is  inclusive  of 
committee fees. 
 
Non-executive directors’ fees are determined within an aggregate directors’ fee pool limit, which is periodically 
recommended for approval by shareholders.  The total maximum currently stands at $400,000. 
 
Remuneration packages may contain the following key elements: 
 
  Director’s fees 
  Consultancy fees 
  Post-employment benefits – superannuation 
  Performance bonuses 
  Other non-cash benefits

The directors are also remunerated for any  additional  services they render the Company and such services are 
carried  out  under  normal  commercial  terms  and  conditions.  Engagement  and  payment  for  such  services  are 
approved by the other directors with no interest in the engagement of such services. 
 
Executive remuneration 
The objective of the Consolidated Entity’s executive reward framework is to ensure reward for performance is 
competitive and appropriate for the results delivered.  The framework aligns executive reward with achievement 
of  strategic  objectives  and  the  creation  of  value  for  shareholders,  and  conforms  with  market  best  practice  for 
delivery of reward.  The Board ensures that executive reward satisfies the following key criteria for good reward

Corporate Governance Disclosures
CI Resources Limited (CI Resources or the Company) has interests in phosphate assets in Australia and palm oil 
plantations  in  Malaysia.    The  Company  is  committed  to  protecting  and  enhancing  shareholder  value  and 
adopting best practice governance policies and practices.
The  Corporate  Governance  Statement  outlines  the  main  Corporate  Governance  practices  that  were  in  place 
throughout  the  financial  year,  which  comply  with  the  ASX  Corporate  Governance  Principles  and 
Recommendations released by the ASX Corporate Governance Council (third edition).
The  following  summarizes  the  eight  recommended  ASX  Principles  of  Good  Governance  and  the  Company’s 
policies and procedures against each of the principles. Where a recommendation has not been followed, this is 
clearly stated along with an explanation for the departure.
Principle 1 – Lay solid foundations for management and oversight
The  Board  currently  consists  of  seven  Directors  of  whom,  four  are  non-independent  directors. The  Board  and 
the Company act within a statutory framework – principally the  Corporations Act and also the Constitution of 
the Company. Subject to this statutory framework, the Board has the authority and the responsibility to perform 
the  functions,  determine  the  policies  and  control  the  affairs  of  CI  Resources  Limited  in  accordance  with  the 
Board Charter published on the Company website.
The  Directors  are  aware  of  their  responsibilities  and  obligations  to  protect  shareholder's  funds.    Due  care  is 
taken to explain both the positive and negative aspects in all reports to highlight the inherent risks involved in 
the phosphate and palm oil plantations industry. The Board  must ensure that the  Company acts in accordance 
with prudent commercial principles and satisfies shareholders – consistent with maximising the Company’s long 
term value.
The  Board  of  Directors  determines  the  strategic  direction  of  the  Company  by  regularly  monitoring  and 
evaluating the performance and status of each of the Company's projects and activities. No formal evaluation of

Principle 2 – Structure the board to add value
The  Board  comprises  of  a  Non-executive  Independent  Chairman,  three  Executive  Directors  and  three  Non-
Executive Directors (of whom 2 are Independent).
The Board is satisfied that the current mix of independent and non- independent Directors is in the best interests 
of the Company and ensures that the Company has available the requisite levels of skill and experience in both 
the phosphate and palm oil sectors.
Full details of the Company’s Board of Directors and their relevant experience and skills are detailed within the 
Directors’ Report.  The Company’s Constitution requires that one third of the  members of the Board retire by 
rotation each year but they are eligible for re-election.
Any new Director appointed holds office only until the next general meeting and is then eligible for re-election.
The  Board  will  ensure  that  any  such  person  to  be  appointed  as  a  Director  possesses  an  appropriate  level  of 
qualifications,  expertise  and  experience.    The  Remuneration  and  Nomination  Committee  review  the  board 
composition  annually  to  ensure  it  continues  to  have  the  right  balance  of  skills,  experience,  independence  and 
knowledge to discharge its responsibilities.
Under the Remuneration and Nomination Committee Charter, the Committee must have at least three members 
who  are  non-executive  directors  with  a  majority  of  whom  are  independent  directors.  The  Chair  of  the  Board 
must not be the Chair of the Committee.
Key terms and conditions relating to the appointment of non-executive directors are set out in a formal letter of 
appointment.
Principle 3 – Act ethically and responsibly
The Board place great emphasis on ethics and integrity in all its business dealings and the Board considers the 
business  practices  and  ethics  exercised  by  individual  board  members  and  key  executives  to  be  of  the  highest 
standards.
The Board, being committed to the highest standards of ethical business conduct has adopted a formal Code of 
Conduct to guide executives, management and staff in carrying out their duties and responsibilities.  The Code is 
subject to ongoing review to ensure that the Company’s standards of behaviour and corporate culture reflect best 
practice in corporate governance.  The Code is based on the following key principles:
  acting with honesty and integrity
  abiding by laws and regulations

respecting confidentiality and handling information in a proper manner
  maintaining the highest standards of professional behaviour
  avoiding conflicts of interest
  striving to be a good corporate citizen and to achieve community respect.
CI Resources Limited also has a number of specific policies on various legal and ethical issues.  These policies 
are  designed  to  foster  and  maintain  ethical  business  conduct  within  the  Company,  and  govern  such  things  as

workplace  and  human  resources  practices,  handling  of  confidential  information,  insider  trading,  risk 
management and legal compliance.
A  formal  Securities  Trading  Policy  has  been  adopted,  lodged  and  released  to  the  market.    This  is  to  ensure 
compliance  with  the  “insider  trading”  provisions  of  the  Corporations  Act  by  executive  staff  who  may  be  in 
possession of sensitive information concerning the Company’s affairs, prior to release to the market.
In addition, the Board has guidelines dealing with disclosure of interests by Directors in participating and voting 
at  Board  meetings  where  any  such  interests  are  discussed.    In  accordance  with  the  Corporations  Act,  any 
Director with a material personal interest in a matter being considered by the Board must not be present when 
the matter is being considered, and may not vote on the matter.
A copy of the Corporate Code of Conduct and the Securities Trading Policy can be found on the CI Resources 
website.
Principle 4 – Safeguard integrity in financial reporting
The Board has established an Audit & Risk Management Committee (ARC). The ARC’s primary function is to 
ensure that an effective internal control framework exists within the Company.  This includes internal controls 
to deal with both the effectiveness and efficiency of significant business processes, including the safeguarding 
of assets, the maintenance of proper accounting records and the reliability of financial information.
The  ARC  is  responsible  for  the  appointment  of  the  external  auditors  of  the  Company,  and  will  time  to  time 
review the scope, performance and fees of those external auditors.  The Company has retained Ernst & Young 
as  its  auditors.  The  Ernst  &  Young  partner  managing  the  external  audit  will  attend  the  2016  AGM  and  be 
available to respond to shareholder’s questions relating to external audit.
The ARC is responsible for engaging independent audit consultants to carry out an internal audit program across 
designated operational functions.
Under  the  Audit  &  Risk  Management  Committee  Charter,  the  Committee  must  have  at  least  three  members, 
who are non-executive directors with a majority of independent directors. The Committee members must have 
basic  knowledge  of  finance  and  accounting  practices.  The  Chair  of  the  Board  must  not  be  the  Chair  of  the 
Committee.

Principle 5 – Make timely and balanced disclosure
The  Company  complied  with  all  disclosure  requirements  to  ensure  that  it  manages  the  disclosure  of  price 
sensitive  information  effectively  and  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  as  set  out  by  regulatory  bodies.  All 
market disclosures are approved by the Board.
The  Chairman  and  Company  Secretaries  are  authorised  to  communicate  with  shareholders  and  the  market  in 
relation  to  Board  approved  disclosures.  The  Chairman  and  Company  Secretaries  are  responsible  for  ensuring 
compliance with the continuous disclosure to the Australian Securities Exchange, analysts, broker, shareholders, 
the media and the public.

Please refer to details of the Audit & Risk Management Committee under Principle 4.
The Audit & Risk Management Committee oversees the establishment, implementation and ongoing review of 
the Company’s risk management and internal control system.
The Christmas Island operations are carried on in an environmentally sensitive area and accordingly operations 
are  carefully  monitored  to  ensure  compliance  with  approved  Environmental  Management  Plans  developed  in 
accordance with legislative requirements.
The  Company  maintains  and  reviews  annually  comprehensive  Public  Liability  and  “All  Risks”  insurance 
policies for all its business and operational activities.
The  Board  has  received  assurance  from  the  Managing  Director  and  the  Chief  Financial  Officer  that,  the 
directors’ declaration provided in accordance with section 295A of the Corporations Act, is founded on a sound 
system  of  risk  management  and  internal  control  and  that  the  system  is  operating  effectively  in  all  material 
respects in relation to financial reporting risks.
Principle 8 – Remunerate fairly and responsibly
The Board has established the Remuneration & Nomination Committee. The Committee operates under a formal 
Remuneration & Investment Committee Charter which is published on the Company’s website. The role of the 
Committee  is  to  review  and  assist  the  Board  to  determine  and  review  compensation  arrangements  for  the 
Directors, the Managing Director, and Senior Executives. The Directors fees are determined by the Company in 
general  meetings  and  other  consulting  services  are  remunerated  at  levels  agreed  by  the  Board  of  Directors.  
Access  is  available  to  the  Company’s  auditors  and  senior  managers,  and  the  ability  to  consult  independent 
experts when necessary.
In  relation  to  non-executive  directors,  there  are  presently  no  schemes  for  termination  or  retirement  benefits, 
other than statutory superannuation.
The Board recognises that the interests of all stakeholders will be best served when the Company, its directors 
and staff adhere to highest standards of business ethics and comply with the law.

with the ASX Principles and Recommendations.

Summary
AASB 9
Financial 
Instruments
AASB 9 (December 2014) is a new standard which 
replaces AASB 139. This new version supersedes 
AASB 9 issued in December 2009 (as amended) and 
AASB 9 (issued in December 2010) and includes a 
model for classification and measurement, a single, 
forward-looking ‘expected loss’ impairment model 
and a substantially-reformed approach to hedge 
accounting.
AASB 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on 
or after 1 January 2018. However, the Standard is 
available for early adoption. The own credit changes 
can be early adopted in isolation without otherwise 
changing the accounting for financial instruments.
Classification and measurement
AASB 9 includes requirements for a simpler 
approach for classification and measurement of 
financial assets compared with the requirements of 
AASB 139. There are also some changes made in 
relation to financial liabilities.
The main changes are described below.
Financial assets
a.
Financial assets that are debt instruments will 
be classified based on (1) the objective of the 
entity's business model for managing the 
financial assets; (2) the characteristics of the 
contractual cash flows.
b.  Allows an irrevocable election on initial
recognition to present gains and losses on 
investments in equity instruments that are not 
held for trading in other comprehensive 
income. Dividends in respect of these 
investments that are a return on investment can 
be recognised in profit or loss and there is no 
impairment or recycling on disposal of the

instrument.
c.
Financial assets can be designated and 
measured at fair value through profit or loss at 
initial recognition if doing so eliminates or 
significantly reduces a measurement or 
recognition inconsistency that would arise 
from measuring assets or liabilities, or 
recognising the gains and losses on them, on 
different bases.
Financial liabilities
Changes introduced by AASB 9 in respect of 
financial liabilities are limited to the measurement of 
liabilities designated at fair value through profit or 
loss (FVPL) using the fair value option.  
Where the fair value option is used for financial 
liabilities, the change in fair value is to be accounted 
for as follows:
•
•
The change attributable to changes in 
credit risk are presented in other 
comprehensive income (OCI)
The remaining change is presented in 
profit or loss
AASB 9 also removes the volatility in profit or loss 
that was caused by changes in the credit risk of 
liabilities elected to be measured at fair value. This 
change in accounting means that gains or losses 
attributable to changes in the entity’s own credit risk 
would be recognised in OCI.  These amounts 
recognised in OCI are not recycled to profit or loss if 
the liability is ever repurchased at a discount.
Impairment
The final version of AASB 9 introduces a new 
expected-loss impairment model that will require 
more timely recognition of expected credit losses. 
Specifically, the new Standard requires entities to 
account for expected credit losses from when 
financial instruments are first recognised and to 
recognise full lifetime expected losses on a more 
timely basis.
Hedge accounting
Amendments to  AASB 9  (December 2009 & 2010 
editions and AASB 2013-9)  issued in December 
2013 included the new hedge accounting 
requirements, including changes to hedge 
effectiveness testing, treatment of hedging costs, risk 
components that can be hedged and disclosures.
Consequential amendments were also made to other 
standards as a result of AASB 9, introduced by 
AASB 2009-11 and superseded by AASB 2010-7, 
AASB 2010-10 and AASB 2014-1 – Part E.
AASB 2014-7 incorporates the consequential 
amendments arising from the issuance of AASB 9 in 
Dec 2014.
AASB 2014-8 limits the application of the existing 
versions of AASB 9 (AASB 9 (December 2009) and 
AASB 9 (December 2010)) from 1 February 2015 
and applies to annual reporting periods beginning on 
after 1 January 2015.

AASB 138)
AASB 2014-3 amends AASB 11 Joint 
Arrangements to provide guidance on the accounting 
for acquisitions of interests in joint operations in 
which the activity constitutes a business. The 
amendments require:
(a)
the acquirer of an interest in a joint operation 
in which the activity constitutes a business, as 
defined in AASB 3 Business Combinations, to 
apply all of the principles on business 
combinations accounting in AASB 3 and other 
Australian Accounting Standards except for 
those principles that conflict with the guidance 
in AASB 11
(b)
the acquirer to disclose the information 
required by AASB 3 and other Australian 
Accounting Standards for business 
combinations
This Standard also makes an editorial correction to 
AASB 11.
AASB 116 Property Plant and Equipment and 
AASB 138 Intangible Assets both establish the 
principle for the basis of depreciation and 
amortisation as being the expected pattern of 
consumption of the future economic benefits of an 
asset.
The IASB has clarified that the use of revenue-based 
methods to calculate the depreciation of an asset is 
not appropriate because revenue generated by an 
activity that includes the use of an asset generally 
reflects factors other than the consumption of the 
economic benefits embodied in the asset.
The amendment also clarified that revenue is 
generally presumed to be an inappropriate basis for 
measuring the consumption of the economic benefits 
embodied in an intangible asset. This presumption, 
however, can be rebutted in certain limited 
circumstances.

Standards –

AASB 15
Revenue from 
Contracts with 
Customers
The amendments require that bearer plants such as 
grape vines, rubber trees and oil palms, should be 
accounted for in the same way as property, plant and 
equipment in AASB 116, because their operation is 
similar to that of manufacturing.  
 
The produce growing on bearer plants will remain 
within the scope of AASB 141 Agriculture.  
This Standard also makes various editorial 
corrections to other Australian Accounting 
Standards.
AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
replaces the existing revenue recognition standards 
AASB 111 Construction Contracts, AASB 118 
Revenue and related Interpretations (Interpretation 
13 Customer Loyalty Programmes, Interpretation 15 
Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate, 
Interpretation 18 Transfers of Assets from 
Customers,  Interpretation  131 Revenue—Barter 
Transactions Involving Advertising Services and 
Interpretation 1042 Subscriber Acquisition Costs in 
the Telecommunications Industry). AASB 15 
incorporates the requirements of IFRS 15 Revenue 
from Contracts with Customers issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) 
and developed jointly with the US Financial 
Accounting Standards Board (FASB).
AASB 15 specifies the accounting treatment for 
revenue arising from contracts with customers 
(except for contracts within the scope of other 
accounting standards such as leases or financial 
instruments).The core principle of AASB 15 is that 
an entity recognises revenue to depict the transfer of 
promised goods or services to customers in an 
amount that reflects the consideration to which the 
entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those 
goods or services. An entity recognises revenue in 
accordance with that core principle by applying the 
following steps:
(a)   Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a
customer
(b)  Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in
the contract
(c)   Step 3: Determine the transaction price 
(d)  Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the
performance obligations in the contract
(e)  Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the
entity satisfies a performance obligation
AASB 2015-8 amended the AASB 15 effective date 
so it is now effective for annual reporting periods 
commencing on or after 1 January 2018. Early 
application is permitted.
AASB 2014-5 incorporates the consequential 
amendments to a number Australian Accounting 
Standards (including Interpretations) arising from 
the issuance of AASB 15.
AASB 2016-3 Amendments to Australian 
Accounting Standards – Clarifications to AASB 15 
amends AASB 15 to clarify the requirements on 
identifying performance obligations, principal 
versus agent considerations and the timing of 
recognising revenue from granting a licence and 
provides further practical expedients on transition to 
AASB 15.

general. Differing application paragraphs are set out 
for individual Standards and Interpretations or 
grouped where possible.  
The application paragraphs do not affect 
requirements in other Standards that specify that 
certain paragraphs apply only to certain types of 
entities.
AASB 2014-9 amends AASB 127 Separate 
Financial Statements, and consequentially amends 
AASB 1 First-time Adoption of Australian 
Accounting Standards and AASB 128 Investments in 
Associates and Joint Ventures, to allow entities to 
use the equity method of accounting for investments 
in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in their 
separate financial statements. 
 
AASB 2014-9 also makes editorial corrections to 
AASB 127. 
 
AASB 2014-9 applies to annual reporting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2016. Early adoption 
permitted.
AASB 2014-10 amends AASB 10 Consolidated 
Financial Statements and AASB 128 to address an 
inconsistency between the requirements in AASB 10 
and those in AASB 128 (August 2011), in dealing 
with the sale or contribution of assets between an 
investor and its associate or joint venture. The 
amendments require:
(a)  A full gain or loss to be recognised when a
transaction involves a business (whether it is 
housed in a subsidiary or not)
(b)  A partial gain or loss to be recognised when a
transaction involves assets that do not 
constitute a business, even if these assets are 
housed in a subsidiary.
AASB 2014-10 also makes an editorial correction to 
AASB 10.
AASB 2015-10 defers the mandatory effective date 
(application date) of AASB 2014-10 so that the 
amendments are required to be applied for annual 
reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2018 instead of 1 January 2016.
The subjects of the principal amendments to the 
Standards are set out below: 
 
AASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations:   
 
Changes in methods of disposal – where an entity 
reclassifies an asset (or disposal group) directly from 
being held for distribution to being held for sale (or 
visa versa), an entity shall not follow the guidance in 
paragraphs 27–29 to account for this change.  
 
AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures:  
 
Servicing contracts  - clarifies how an entity should 
apply the guidance in paragraph 42C of AASB 7 to a 
servicing contract to decide whether a servicing 
contract is ‘continuing involvement’ for the 
purposes of applying the disclosure requirements in

Notes to the financial statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2016
paragraphs 42E–42H of AASB 7. 
 
Applicability of the amendments to AASB 7 to 
condensed interim financial statements - clarify that 
the additional disclosure required by the 
amendments to AASB 7 Disclosure–Offsetting 
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities is not 
specifically required for all interim periods. 
However, the additional disclosure is required to be 
given in condensed interim financial statements that 
are prepared in accordance with AASB 134 Interim 
Financial Reporting when its inclusion would be 
required by the requirements of AASB 134. 
 
AASB 119 Employee Benefits: 
 
Discount rate: regional market issue - clarifies that 
the high quality corporate bonds used to estimate the 
discount rate for post-employment benefit 
obligations should be denominated in the same 
currency as the liability. Further it clarifies that the 
depth of the market for high quality corporate bonds 
should be assessed at the currency level. 
 
AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting:  
 
Disclosure of information ‘elsewhere in the interim 
financial report’ - amends AASB 134 to clarify the 
meaning of disclosure of information ‘elsewhere in 
the interim financial report’ and to require the 
inclusion of a cross-reference from the interim 
financial statements to the location of this 
information.
The Standard makes amendments to AASB 101 
Presentation of Financial Statements arising from 
the IASB’s Disclosure Initiative project. The 
amendments are designed to further encourage 
companies to apply professional judgment in 
determining what information to disclose in the 
financial statements.  For example, the amendments 
make clear that materiality applies to the whole of 
financial statements and that the inclusion of 
immaterial information can inhibit the usefulness of 
financial disclosures.  The amendments also clarify 
that companies should use professional judgment in 
determining where and in what order information is 
presented in the financial disclosures.
This makes amendments to AASB 10, AASB 12 
Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities and AASB 
128 arising from the IASB’s narrow scope 
amendments associated with Investment Entities.

months, unless the underlying asset is of low value. 
 
A lessee measures right-of-use assets similarly to 
other non-financial assets and lease liabilities 
similarly to other financial liabilities.  
 
Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially 
measured on a present value basis. The measurement 
includes non-cancellable lease payments (including 
inflation-linked payments), and also includes 
payments to be made in optional periods if the lessee 
is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend 
the lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate 
the lease. 
 
AASB 16 contains disclosure requirements for 
lessees.
Lessor accounting 
 
AASB 16 substantially carries forward the lessor 
accounting requirements in AASB 117. 
Accordingly, a lessor continues to classify its leases 
as operating leases or finance leases, and to account 
for those two types of leases differently. 
 
AASB 16 also requires enhanced disclosures to be 
provided by lessors that will improve information 
disclosed about a lessor’s risk exposure, particularly 
to residual value risk. 
AASB 16 supersedes: 
(a) AASB 117 Leases 
(b) Interpretation 4 Determining whether an 
Arrangement contains a Lease 
(c) SIC-15 Operating Leases—Incentives 
(d) SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions 
Involving the Legal Form of a Lease 
 
The new standard will be effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Early 
application is permitted, provided the new revenue 
standard, AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers, has been applied, or is applied at the 
same date as AASB 16.
This Standard amends AASB 112 Income Taxes 
(July 2004) and AASB 112 Income Taxes (August 
2015) to clarify the requirements on recognition of 
deferred tax assets for unrealised losses on debt 
instruments measured at fair value.
This Standard amends AASB 107 Statement of Cash 
Flows (August 2015) to require entities preparing 
financial statements in accordance with Tier 1 
reporting requirements to provide disclosures that 
enable users of financial statements to evaluate 
changes in liabilities arising from financing 
activities, including both changes arising from cash 
flows and non-cash changes.
This standard amends to AASB 2 Share-based 
Payment, clarifying how to account for certain types 
of share-based payment transactions. The 
amendments provide requirements on the accounting 
for:
►  The effects of vesting and non-vesting 
conditions on the measurement of cash-
settled share-based payments

Notes to the financial statements

(c)  Basis of consolidation
The  consolidated  financial  statements  comprise  the  financial  statements  of  CI  Resources  Limited 
(“company” or “parent entity”) as at 30 June 2016 and the results of its subsidiaries for the financial 
year then ended. Interests in associates are equity accounted. 
 
CI  Resources  Limited  and  its  subsidiaries  together  are  referred  to  in  this  financial  report  as  the 
Group or Consolidated Entity. 
 
The  acquisition  method  of  accounting  is  used  to  account  for  the  acquisition  of  subsidiaries  by  the 
Group. 
 
Subsidiaries are all those entities over which the Group has exposed, or has rights to variable return 
from its involvement in the subsidiary and has the ability to affect those return through its control.  
 
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent 
company,  using  consistent  accounting  policies.  In  preparing  the  consolidated  financial  statements, 
all  intercompany  balances,  transactions,  unrealised  gains  and  losses  resulting  from  intra-group 
transactions and dividends have been eliminated in full. 
 
All controlled entities have a June financial year-end. 
 
Subsidiaries  are  fully  consolidated  from  the  date  on  which  control  is  obtained  by  the  Group  and 
cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. 
 
Investments in  subsidiaries held by  CI Resources  Limited are accounted for at cost in  the separate 
financial  statements  of  the  parent  entity  less  any  impairment  charges.  Dividends  received  from 
subsidiaries are recorded as a component of other revenues in the separate income statement of the 
parent  entity,  and  do  not  impact  the  recorded  cost  of  the  investment.  Upon  receipt  of  dividend 
payments  from  subsidiaries,  the  parent  will  assess  whether  any  indicators  of  impairment  of  the 
carrying  value  of  the  investment  in  the  subsidiary  exist.  Where  such  indicators  exist,  to  the  extent 
that  the  carrying  value  of  the  investment  exceeds  its  recoverable  amount,  an  impairment  loss  is 
recognised. 
 
The  acquisition  of  subsidiaries  is  accounted  for  using  the  acquisition  method  of  accounting.  The 
acquisition method of accounting involves recognising at acquisition date, separately from goodwill, 
the  identifiable  assets  acquired,  the  liabilities  assumed  and  any  non-controlling  interest  in  the 
acquiree.  The  identifiable  assets  acquired  and  the  liabilities  assumed  are  measured  at  their 
acquisition date fair values. 
 
The  difference  between  the  above  items  and  the  fair  value  of  the  consideration  (including  the  fair 
value of any pre-existing investment in the acquiree) is goodwill or a discount on acquisition. 
 
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For 
the  purpose  of  impairment  testing,  goodwill  acquired  in  a  business  combination  is,  from  the 
acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit 
from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned 
to those units. 
 
Where  goodwill  forms  part  of  a  cash-generating  unit  and  part  of  the  operation  within  that  unit  is 
disposed  of,  the  goodwill  associated  with  the  operation  disposed  of  is  included  in  the  carrying 
amount of the operation  when determining the  gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill 
disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed 
of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
Annual Report – 30 June 2016

CI RESOURCES LIMITED 
 
Notes to the financial statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2016
Non-controlling  interests  are  allocated  their  share  of  net  profit  after  tax  in  the  statement  of 
comprehensive income and are presented within equity in the consolidated statement of financial 
position, separately from the equity of the owners of the parent. 
 
Losses are attributed to the non-controlling interest even if that results in a deficit balance.  
 
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as 
an  equity  transaction.  If  the  Group  loses  control  over  a  subsidiary,  it  derecognises  the  related 
assets  (including  goodwill),  liabilities,  non-controlling  interest  and  other  components  of  equity 
while  any  resultant  gain  or  loss  is  recognised  in  profit  or  loss.  Any  investment  retained  is 
recognised at fair value.
(d)  Income tax
The  charge  for  current  income  tax  expense  is  based  on  the  profit  for  the  year  adjusted  for  any 
non-assessable or disallowed items.  It is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or are 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
 
Deferred  tax  is  accounted  for  using  the  balance  sheet  liability  method  in  respect  of  temporary 
differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in 
the financial statements.  No deferred income tax will be recognised from the initial recognition 
of an asset or liability, excluding a business combination, where there is no effect on accounting 
or taxable profit or loss. 
 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset 
is realised or liability is settled.  Deferred tax is credited in the income statement except where it 
relates to items that may be credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is adjusted 
directly against equity. 
 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future tax profits 
will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.  Unrecognised 
deferred  income  tax  assets  are  reassessed  at  each  balance  sheet  date  and  are  recognised  to  the 
extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be 
recovered. 
 
The amount of benefits brought to account or which may be realised in the future is based on the 
assumption that no adverse change will occur in income taxation legislation and the anticipation 
that the economic entity  will  derive sufficient future assessable income to enable the benefit to 
be realised and comply with the conditions of deductibility imposed by the law.
(e)  Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.  The cost of mining stocks 
includes  direct  materials,  direct  labour,  transportation  costs  and  variable  and  fixed  overhead 
costs  relating  to  mining  activities.    Overheads  are  applied  on  the  basis  of  normal  operating 
capacity.  Costs are assigned on the basis of weighted average costs. 
 
Net  realisable  value  is  the  estimated  selling  price  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business,  less 
estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
(f)  Property, plant and equipment
Each class of property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
any impairment losses.

Plant and equipment 
Plant  and  equipment  are  measured  on  the  cost  basis  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  any 
impairment losses. 
 
The carrying amount of plant and equipment is reviewed annually by the directors to ensure it is 
not in excess of the recoverable amount from these assets (refer to note 2(l) for accounting policy 
on recoverable amount). 
 
The  cost  of  fixed  assets  constructed  within  the  economic  entity  includes  the  cost  of  materials, 
direct labour, borrowing costs and an appropriate proportion of fixed and variable overheads. 
 
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as 
appropriate only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item  will 
flow  to  the  group  and  the  cost  of  the  item  can  be  measured  reliably.    All  other  repairs  and 
maintenance  are  charged  to  the  income  statement  during  the  financial  period  in  which  they  are 
incurred. 
 
Depreciation 
The  depreciable  amount  of  all  fixed  assets  including  building  and  capitalised  lease  assets,  but 
excluding freehold land are depreciated on a straight line or diminishing balance basis over their 
useful  lives  to  the  economic  entity  commencing  from  the  time  the  asset  is  held  ready  for  use.  
Leasehold  improvements  are  depreciated  over  the  shorter  of  either  the  unexpired  period  of  the 
lease  or  the  estimated  useful  lives  of  the  improvements.    The  depreciation  rates  used  for  each 
class of depreciation assets are:
Class of Fixed Asset
Leasehold and strata title properties
Plant and equipment under lease:
- the shorter of the lease term and life span
Plant and equipment
Mine properties
Depreciation Rate
Shorter of the lease 
and 2%
20 – 30%
5 – 40%
Life of mine
The  assets’  residual  values  and  useful  lives  are  reviewed,  and  adjusted  if  appropriate,  at  each 
balance sheet date. 
 
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount.  
These gains and losses are included in the income statement.
(g)  Mining tenements and exploration expenditure
Costs  incurred  during  exploration  and  evaluation  activities  related  to  an  area  of  interest  are 
accumulated at cost. 
 
Such costs are only carried forward to the extent that they are expected to be recouped through 
the successful development of the area of interest, or alternatively its sale, or where activities in 
the  area  of  interest  have  not  yet  reached  a  stage  which  permits  a  reasonable  assessment  of  the 
existence  or  otherwise  of  economically  recoverable  reserves,  and  active  operations  are 
continuing. 
 
Accumulated costs in relation to abandoned areas of interest are written off in full in the year in 
which the decision to abandon the area is made. 
 
A  regular  review  is  undertaken  of  each  area  of  interest  to  determine  the  appropriateness  of 
continuing to carry forward costs in relation to that area of interest.

Notes to the financial statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2016
(h)  Mine properties
Costs  incurred  prior  to  the  startup  of  operations  or  mining  assets  acquired  are  accumulated  at 
cost.    Such  costs  are  only  carried  forward  to  the  extent  that  they  are  expected  to  be  recouped 
through the successful exploitation of the known reserves.
Impairment 
The carrying amount of mine properties is reviewed annually by the directors to ensure it is not 
in  excess  of  the  recoverable  amount  of  these  assets  (refer  to  note  2(l)  for  accounting  policy  on 
recoverable amount).
(i)  Decommissioning
Estimated  decommissioning  expenditure  is  recognised  as  a  provision  when  the  Group  has  a 
present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
 
If the effect of the time value of money is material, the amounts are determined by discounting 
the  expected  future  cash  flows  at  a  pre-tax  rate  that  reflects  current  market  assessments  of  the 
time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. 
 
The amortisation or ‘unwinding’ of the discount applied in establishing the net present value of 
provision  is  charged  to  the  income  statement  in  each  accounting  period,  and  is  disclosed  as  a 
financing costs. 
 
Other  changes  in  the  measurement  of  an  existing  decommissioning  obligation  that  result  from 
changes in the estimated timing or amount of future costs, or a change in the discount rate, are 
recognised as an adjustment to the decommissioning asset.
(j)  Leases
Leases of fixed assets where substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to the ownership of 
the  asset,  but  not  the  legal  ownership  that  are  transferred  to  entities  in  the  economic  entity  are 
classified as finance leases. 
 
Finance  leases  are  capitalised  by  recording  an  asset  and  a  liability  at  the  lower  of  the  amounts 
equal to the fair value of the leased property or the present value of the minimum lease payments, 
including any guaranteed residual values.  Lease payments are allocated between the reduction of 
the lease liability and the lease interest expense for the period. 
 
Leased assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives where it is 
likely that the economic entity will obtain ownership of the asset or over the term of the lease. 
 
Lease payments of operating leases, where substantially all the risks and benefits remain with the 
lessor, are charged as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred. 
 
Lease incentives under operating leases are recognised as a liability and amortised on a straight-
line basis over the life of the lease term.
(k)  Derivative financial instruments
Derivative  financial  instruments  are  used  by  the  Group  to  provide  an  economic  hedge  of 
exposures  to  exchange  rates.    The  consolidated  entity  does  not  apply  hedge  accounting  and 
accordingly  all  fair  value  movements  on  derivative  financial  instruments  are  recognised  in  the 
statement of comprehensive income. 
 
Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered
Annual Report – 30 June 2016
43
CI RESOURCES LIMITED 
 
Notes to the financial statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2016
into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair  value at each reporting date.  Derivatives are 
carried  as  assets  when  their  fair  value  is  positive  and  as  liabilities  when  their  fair  value  is 
negative.  The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately.  
 
The  fair  values  of  forward  currency  contracts  are  calculated  by  reference  to  current  forward 
exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. 
 
Impairment of non-financial assets other than goodwill
(l)
At each reporting date, the company assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be 
impaired.  
 
Where  an  indicator  of  impairment  exists,  the  Company  makes  a  formal  estimate  of  recoverable 
amount.    Where  the  carrying  amount  of  an  asset  exceeds  its  recoverable  amount  the  asset  is 
considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. 
 
Recoverable  amount  is  the  greater  of  fair  value  less  costs  to  sell  and  value  in  use.    It  is 
determined for an individual asset, unless the asset’s value in use cannot be estimated to be close 
to its fair value less costs to sell and it does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent 
of  those  from  other  assets  or  groups  of  assets,  in  which  case,  the  recoverable  amount  is 
determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
 
In  assessing  value  in  use,  the  estimated  future  cash  flows  are  discounted  to  their  present  value 
using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset.
(m)  Intangibles
Goodwill 
Goodwill is initially recorded at the amount by which the purchase price for a business or for an 
ownership  interest  in  a  controlled  entity  exceeds  the  fair  value  attributed  to  the  identifiable  net 
assets at the date of acquisition.  
 
Following  initial  recognition,  goodwill  is  measured  at  cost  less  any  accumulated  impairment 
losses. 
 
Goodwill  is  reviewed  for  impairment  annually  or  more  frequently  if  events  or  changes  in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Impairment losses recognised for 
goodwill are not subsequently reversed. 
 
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to 
the entity sold. 
 
Research and Development 
Expenditure  during  the  research  phase  of  a  project  is  recognised  as  an  expense  when  incurred. 
Development costs are capitalised only when technical feasibility studies indicate that the project 
will deliver future economic benefits and these benefits can be measured reliably.
(n)  Foreign currency transactions and balances
Functional and presentation currency 
The functional currency of each of the group’s entities is determined by reference to the currency 
of the primary economic environment in  which that entity  operates.  The  consolidated financial 
statements  are  presented  in  Australian  dollars  which  is  the  parent  entity’s  functional  and 
presentation currency.
Annual Report – 30 June 2016

CI RESOURCES LIMITED 
 
Notes to the financial statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2016
Transactions and balances 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates 
prevailing  at  the  date  of  the  transaction.    Foreign  currency  monetary  items  are  translated  at  the 
year-end exchange rate.  Non-monetary items measured at historical cost continue to be carried at 
the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.   Non-monetary items measured at fair value are 
reported at the exchange rate at the date when fair values were determined. 
Exchange differences arising  on the translation of  monetary items are recognised in the  income 
statement. 
 
Exchange differences arising on the translation of non-monetary items are recognised directly in 
equity to the extent that the gain or loss is directly recognised in equity, otherwise the exchange 
difference is recognised in the income statement. 
 
Group companies 
The  financial  results  and  position  of  foreign  operations  whose  functional  currency  is  different 
from the group’s presentation currency are translated as follows:
  Assets  and  liabilities  are  translated  at  year-end  exchange  rates  prevailing  at  that
reporting date. 
Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period.

Exchange  differences  arising  on  translation  of  foreign  operations  are  transferred  directly  to  the 
group’s  foreign  currency  translation  reserve  in  the  balance  sheet.    These  differences  are 
recognised in the income statement in the period in which the operation is disposed.
(o)  Cash and cash equivalents
Cash  and  cash  equivalents  includes  cash  on  hand,  deposits  held  at  call  with  banks,  other  short-
term  highly  liquid  investments  with  original  maturities  of  three  months  or  less,  and  bank 
overdrafts.  Bank overdrafts are shown within short-term borrowings in current liabilities on the 
balance sheet.
(p)  Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are carried at nominal amounts due 
less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts.  An allowance for doubtful debts is made when 
there  is  objective  evidence  that  the  Group  will  not  be  able  to  collect  the  debts.    Bad  debts  are 
written-off when identified. 
 
Receivables  from  related  parties  are  recognised  and  carried  at  the  nominal  amount  due.    An 
estimate for doubtful debts is considered based on the financial position of the related party.
(q)  Trade and other payables
Trade  payables  and  other  payables  are  carried  at  amortised  costs  and  represent  liabilities  for 
goods  and  services  provided  to  the  Group  prior  to  the  end  of  the  financial  year  that  are  unpaid 
and arise when the Group becomes obliged to make future payments in respect of the purchase of 
these goods and services.
(r)  Segment reporting
An operating segment is a component of an entity that engages in business activities from which 
it  may  earn  revenues  and  incur  expenses  (including  revenues  and  expenses  relating  to 
transactions  with  other  components  of  the  same  entity),  whose  operating  results  are  regularly 
reviewed by the entity's chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be 
allocated to the segment and assess its performance and for which discrete financial information 
is available. This includes  start up operations  which are  yet to earn revenues. Management  will

For the year ended 30 June 2016
also  consider  other  factors  in  determining  operating  segments  such  as  the  existence  of  a  line 
manager and the level of segment information presented to the board of directors.
Operating segments have been identified based on the information provided to the chief operating 
decision makers — being the executive management team.
The  group  aggregates  two  or  more  operating  segments  when  they  have  similar  economic 
characteristics, and 
the segments are similar in each of the following respects:
  Nature of the products and services 
  Nature of the production processes 
  Type or class of customer for the products and services 
  Methods used to distribute the products or provide the services, and if applicable 
  Nature of the regulatory environment
Operating  segments  that  meet  the  quantitative  criteria  as  prescribed  by  AASB  8  are  reported 
separately. 
 
However,  an  operating  segment  that  does  not  meet  the  quantitative  criteria  is  still  reported 
separately  where  information  about  the  segment  would  be  useful  to  users  of  the  financial 
statements. 
 
Information about other business activities and operating segments that are below the quantitative 
criteria are combined and disclosed in a separate category for “all other segments”.
(s)  Business Combination
Business  combinations  are  accounted  for  using  the  acquisition  method.  The  consideration 
transferred in a business combination shall be measured at fair value, which shall be calculated as 
the sum of the acquisition date fair values of the assets transferred by the acquirer, the liabilities 
incurred by the acquirer to former owners of the acquiree and the equity issued by the acquirer, 
and  the  amount  of  any  non-controlling  interest  in  the  acquiree.  For  each  business  combination, 
the  acquirer  measures  the  non-controlling  interest  in  the  acquiree  either  at  fair  value  or  at  the 
proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. 
 
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred, and included in administrative expenses. 
 
When  the  Group  acquires  a  business,  it  assesses  the  financial  assets  and  liabilities  assumed  for 
appropriate  classification  and  designation  in  accordance  with  the  contractual  terms,  economic 
conditions, the Group’s operating or accounting policies and other pertinent conditions as at the 
acquisition  date.  This  includes  the  separation  of  embedded  derivatives  in  host  contracts  by  the 
acquiree.  
 
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer's 
previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date 
through profit or loss. 
 
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at 
the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is 
deemed  to  be  an  asset  or  liability  will  be  recognised  in  accordance  with  AASB  139  either  in 
profit  or  loss  or  as  a  change  to  other  comprehensive  income.  If  the  contingent  consideration  is 
classified as equity, it should not be remeasured until it is finally settled within equity.

(t)  Revenue
Sale of goods 
Revenue  is  recognised  when  there  has  been  a  passing  of  the  significant  risks  and  rewards  of 
ownership, which means the following: 
 
  The product is in a form suitable for delivery and no further processing is required by or on
behalf of the consolidated entity;
  The quantity and quality of the product can be determined with reasonable accuracy; 
  The product has been despatched to the customer and is no longer under the physical control
of the consolidated entity;
  The selling price can be measured reliably; 

It  is  probable  that  the  economic  benefits  associated  with  the  transaction  will  flow  to  the 
consolidated entity; and
  The costs incurred, or expected to be incurred, in respect of the transaction can be measured
reliably.
Interest  
Revenue is recognised as the  Interest accrues  using the effective interest rate  method (which is 
the  rate  that  exactly  discounts  estimated  future  cash  receipts  through  the  expected  life  of  the 
financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset). 
 
Rendering of services 
Revenue from a contract to provide services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion 
of the contract. 
 
Dividends 
Revenue is recognised when the right to receive a dividend has been established.
(u)  Government grants
Government  grants  are  recognised  when  there  is  reasonable  assurance  that  the  grant  will  be 
received and all attaching conditions will be complied with. 
 
When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as income over the periods necessary 
to match the grant on a systematic basis to the costs that it is intended to compensate. 
 
When the grant relates to an asset, the fair value is credited to a deferred income account and is 
released  to  the  income  statement  over  the  expected  useful  life  of  the  relevant  asset  by  equal 
annual installments.
(v)  Employee benefits
Provision  is  made  for  the  Company’s  liability  for  employee  benefits  arising  from  services 
rendered by employees up until balance date. Employee benefits that are expected to be settled 
within  one  year  have  been  measured  at  the  amounts  expected  to  be  paid  when  the  liability  is 
settled, plus related on-costs.  Employee benefits payable later than one year have been measured 
at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made for those benefits.
(w)  Provisions
Provisions  are  recognised  when  the  group  has  a  legal  or  constructive  obligation,  as  a  result  of 
past  events,  for  which  it  is  probable  that  an  outflow  of  economic  benefits  will  result  and  that 
outflow can be reliably measured.

Notes to the financial statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2016
(x)  Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of assets that 
necessarily take a substantial period of time to prepare for their intended use or sale, are added to 
the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use 
or sale. 
All other borrowing costs are recognised in income during the period in which they are incurred.
(y)  Plantation development costs
Costs incurred on land clearing are capitalised as plantation development costs and is amoritsed 
over the economic useful life of the asset (25 years). Costs on the concession lease with a term of 
60 years are capitalised and amortised over the remaining term of lease.
(z)  Biological assets
Biological assets which include mature and immature oil palm plantations are stated at fair value 
less estimated point of sale costs except when the fair value cannot be measured reliably. In this 
instance,  the  biological  assets  are  measured  at  cost  less  any  accumulated  depreciation  and  any 
accumulated impairment losses until such time as its fair value can be reliably measured. 
 
Fresh fruit bunches (which are subsequently milled to become palm oil) is the harvested product 
of a biological asset and is measured at its fair value less estimated point of sale costs at the point 
of harvest. 
 
Net movement in fair value less estimated point of sale costs of biological assets are included in 
the statement of comprehensive income in the year they arise.
(aa)  Term deposit
Term  deposits  which  have  a  maturity  of  less  than  twelve  months  are  shown  in  current  assets. 
Term deposits which are held to fund employee benefits stated and demolition costs are shown in 
non current assets.
(ab) Goods and services tax (GST)
Revenues,  expenses  and  assets  are  recognised  net  of  the  amount  of  associated  GST,  unless  the 
GST incurred is not recoverable from the Australian Taxation Office. In this case it is recognised 
as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense. 
 
Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The 
net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the  Australian Taxation Office is  included 
with other receivables or payables in the balance sheet. 
 
Cash  flows  are  presented  on  a  gross  basis.  The  GST  components  of  cash  flows  arising  from 
investing  or  financing  activities  which  are  recoverable  from,  or  payable  to  the  Australian 
Taxation Office, are presented as operating cash flow. 
 
Commitments  and  contingencies  are  disclosed  net  of  the  amount  of  GST  recoverable  from,  or 
payable to, the Australia Taxation Office.
(ac) Financial instruments
Recognition 
Financial instruments are initially measured at fair value, which includes transaction costs, when 
the contractual rights or obligations exist. Subsequent to initial recognition these instruments are 
measured as set out below.
Annual Report – 30 June 2016

CI RESOURCES LIMITED 
 
Notes to the financial statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2016
Loans and receivables 
Loans  and  receivables  are  non-derivative  financial  assets  with  fixed  or  determinable  payments 
that are not quoted in an active market. They arise when the consolidated entity provides money, 
goods  or  services  directly  to  a  debtor  with  no  intention  of  selling  the  receivable.  They  are 
included  in  current  assets,  except  for  those  with  maturities  greater  than  12  months  after  the 
statement  of  financial  position  date  which  are  classified  as  non-current  assets  and  carried  at 
amortised  cost.  Loans  and  receivables  are  included  in  receivables  in  the  statement  of  financial 
position. 
 
Financial liabilities 
Non-derivative financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, comprising original debt less 
principal repayments and amortisation. 
 
Impairment 
The Consolidated Entity assesses at each balance date whether there is objective evidence that a 
financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
(ad) Investments in associates
Associates  are  all  entities  over  which  the  Group  has  significant  influence  but  not  control, 
generally  accompanying  a  shareholding  of  between  20%  and  50%  of  the  voting  rights.  
Investments  in  associates  are  accounted  for  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  using  the 
equity method of accounting, after initially being recognised at cost.  The Group’s investment in 
associates includes goodwill (net of any accumulated impairment loss) identified on acquisition. 
 
The  Group’s  share  of  its  associates’  post-acquisition  profits  or  losses  is  recognised  in  the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is 
recognised  in  reserves.    The  cumulative  post-acquisition  movements  are  adjusted  against  the 
carrying amount of the investment.  Dividends receivable  from associates are recognised in the 
parent  entity’s  income  statement,  while  in  consolidated  financial  statements  they  reduce  the 
carrying amount of the investment. 
 
When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, 
including  any  other  unsecured  long-term  receivables,  the  Group  does  not  recognise  further 
losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. 
 
Unrealised  gains  on  transactions  between  the  Group  and  its  associates  are  eliminated  to  the 
extent of the Group’s interest in the associates.  Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the 
transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.  Accounting policies of 
associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by 
the Group.
(ae) Contributed equity
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. 
 
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity 
as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
(af) Comparative figures
Where  required  by  Accounting  Standards,  comparative  figures  have  been  adjusted  to  conform 
with changes in presentation for the current financial year.

(ag) Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share
(i) 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the 
consolidated  entity,  excluding  any  costs  of  servicing  equity  other  than  ordinary  shares,  by  the 
weighted  average  number  of  ordinary  shares  outstanding  during  the  year,  adjusted  for  bonus 
elements in ordinary shares issued during the year. 
 
(ii) 
Diluted  earnings  per  share  adjusts  the  figures  used  in  the  determination  of  basic  earnings  per 
share  to  take  into  account  the  after  income  tax  effect  of  interest  and  other  financing  costs 
associated  with  dilutive  potential  ordinary  shares  and  the  weighted  average  number  of  shares 
assumed to have been issued for no consideration in relation to dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Diluted earnings per share
(ah) Impairment of assets
Assets  are  reviewed  for  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that 
the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by 
which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the 
higher  of  an  asset’s  fair  value  less  costs  to  sell  and  value  in  use.  For  the  purposes  of  assessing 
impairment,  assets  are  grouped  at  the  lowest  levels  for  which  there  are  separately  identifiable 
cash flows (cash generating units).
3.     Judgments in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty
(a)  In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following 
judgments, apart from those involving estimations, which have the most significant effect on the 
amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Assessment of mine life on Christmas Island 
The  Financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on  the  basis  that  the  resource  supports  continued 
operations for at least 5 years on the current market parameters and expectations. 
 
Determination of mineral resources and ore reserves 
The  Group’s  policy  for  estimating  its  mineral  resources  and  ore  reserves  requires  that  the 
Australian  Code  for  Reporting  of  Exploration  Results,  Mineral  Resources  and  Ore  Reserves 
2004 (the ‘JORC code’) be used as a minimum standard.  The information on mineral resources 
and ore reserves were prepared by or under the supervision of Competent Persons as defined in 
the  JORC  code.    The  amounts  presented  are  based  on  the  mineral  resources  and  ore  reserves 
determined under the JORC code. 
 
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating mineral resources and ore reserves and 
assumptions  that  are  valid  at  the  time  of  estimation  may  change  significantly  when  new 
information becomes available. 
 
Changes in the  forecast prices of commodities,  exchange rates or production costs  may  change 
the  economic  status  of  resources  and  may,  ultimately,  result  in  the  resources  being  restated.  
Such  changes  in  resources  could  impact  on  depreciation  and  amortisation  rates,  asset  carrying 
values and provisions for decommissioning.
(b)  The carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities are often determined based on estimates and 
assumptions of future events.  The key estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of 
causing a material adjustment to the  carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities  within the 
next annual reporting period are:

Impairment of property, plant and equipment 
Property,  plant  and  equipment  is  reviewed  for  impairment  if  there  is  any  indication  that  the 
carrying  amount  may  not  be  recoverable.    Where  a  review  for  impairment  is  conducted,  the 
recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the higher of ‘value in use’ (being the net present 
value of expected future cash flows of the relevant cash generating unit) and ‘fair value less costs 
to sell’. 
 
In determining value in use, future cash flows are based on: 
  Estimates of the quantities of ore reserves and mineral resources; 
  Future production levels; 
  Future commodity prices and foreign exchange rates; and 
  Future cash costs of production and capital expenditure. 
 
Variations  to  the  expected  future  cash  flows,  and  the  timing  thereof,  could  result  in  significant 
changes to any impairment losses recognised, if any, which could in turn impact future financial 
results. 
 
Provisions for decommissioning costs 
Decommissioning costs are a normal consequence of mining and the majority of this expenditure 
is  incurred  at  the  end  of  a  mine’s  life.    In  determining  an  appropriate  level  of  provision 
consideration  is  given  to  the  expected  future  costs  to  be  incurred,  the  timing  of  these  expected 
future costs (largely dependent on the life of the mine), the appropriateness of the discount rate 
and the estimated future level of inflation. 
 
The  ultimate  cost  of  decommissioning  is  uncertain  and  costs  can  vary  in  response  to  many 
factors  including  changes  to  the  relevant  legal  requirements  or  the  emergence  of  new 
decommissioning techniques.  The expected timing of expenditure can also change, for example 
in response to changes in reserves or to production rates. 
 
Changes to any of the estimates could result in  significant  changes to the  level of provisioning 
required, which would in turn impact future financial results. 
 
Fair value of biological assets 
The fair value of the oil palm plantations is  estimated by reference to independent professional 
valuations using the discounted cash flows of the underlying biological assets. The expected cash 
flows from the whole life cycle of the oil palm plantations is determined using the market price 
and  the  estimated  yield  of  the  agricultural  produce,  being  FFB,  net  of  maintenance  and 
harvesting  costs  and  any  costs  required  to  bring  the  oil  palm  plantations  to  maturity.  The 
estimated yield of the oil palm plantations is dependent on the age of the oil palm trees, location 
of the plantations, soil type and infrastructure. The market price of FFB is largely dependent on 
the prevailing market prices of crude palm oil and palm kernel. 
 
Deferred Tax Asset 
The carrying value of the deferred tax asset is subject to the assumptions and estimates referred 
to in Note 5.

Notes to the financial statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2016 
 
 
This deferred tax asset will only be obtained if: 
(a)
future assessable income is derived of a nature and of an amount sufficient to enable the benefit to be  
realised; 
the conditions for deductibility imposed by tax legislation continue to be complied with; and  
no changes in tax legislation adversely affect the consolidation entity in realising the benefit.
(b) 
(c) 
 
The  entity  has  made  non-current  provisions  for  decommissioning  of  $8,998,000  (2015:  $9,904,000)  and 
employee  redundancies  of  $9,087,000  (2015:  $8,982,000).    A  portion  of  the  future  income  tax  benefit 
relating to the provision for decommissioning and the provision for employee redundancy is considered to be 
not  probable  of  being  recovered,  as  it  is  believed  that  when  the  provisions  are  required  the  entity  may  not 
have future taxable income to fully utilise the tax benefit. 
 
CI  Resources  Limited  and  its  wholly  owned  controlled  entities  have  not  entered  into  a  tax  consolidation 
agreement.

There are no instruments (e.g., share options) excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share that 
could potentially dilute  basic  earnings per share in the  future because they are antidilutive  for either of the 
periods presented. 
 
 
There  have  been  no  transactions  involving  ordinary  shares  or  potential  ordinary  shares  that  would 
significantly  change  the  number  of  ordinary  shares  or  potential  ordinary  shares  outstanding  between  the

Goodwill  acquired  through  business  combination  has  been  allocated  to  the  Palm  Oil  Cash  Generating  Unit 
(“CGU”), which is also a reporting and operating segment for impairment testing. The net carrying amount of 
Goodwill  at  30  June  2016  was  $7,158,000  (2015:  $7,158,000)  which  includes  an  accumulated  impairment 
charge of nil during the year (2015: nil).  
 
The recoverable amount of the Farming CGU has been determined using a value in use calculation using cash 
flow projections.  The post-tax discount rates applied  to cash flow projections is 4.5% (2015: 10.0%) and the
Annual Report – 30 June 2016

Notes to the financial statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2016 
 
cash flows are based on the financial budget approved by management for the upcoming year and applying an 
inflation rate of 2.7% p.a (2015: 3.1%) for the following 4 years and a terminal value.
With regard to the assessments of the value in use of the Farming CGU, management believe that no reasonably 
possible change in any of the above key assumptions  would cause the carrying  value of the  unit to  materially 
exceed its recoverable amount.

Biological assets consist of mature oil palm trees. The Group grows oil palm trees to produce palm oil. The 
plantation  is  located  in  Malaysia.  At  30  June  2016  the  group  held  oil  palm  trees  on  approximately  1,643 
hectares of land. 
 
A  valuation  was  conducted  by  an  independent  professional  valuer,  on  a  subsidiary's  oil  palm  estate 
development  comprising  land,  ancillary  facilities  and  biological  assets,  for  the  purposes  of  fair  valuing  the 
biological assets of the subsidiary as at 30 June 2016. Significant assumptions applied in the determination of 
fair value are:
10,581 
- 
449 
(1,734) 
9,296
Average remaining life of oil palm trees 
Average annual yield per hectare

The fair value is estimated using a discounted cashflow model. The fair value model is categorised as Level 3 as 
it uses inputs that are not based on observable market data. 
 
Significant increases (decreases) in production growth per annum in isolation would result in a significantly 
higher (lower) fair value of the biological asset. Significant increases (decreases) in the long-term discount rate 
would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value. Generally, a change in the assumption made for the 
estimated Palm Oil revenue is accompanied by a directionally similar change in the cost of fresh fruit bunches.
The Group is exposed to risks in respect of agricultural activity. The agricultural activity of the Group consists 
of the plantation development and cultivation of palm products.
The primary risk associated with this activity occurs due to the length of time between expending cash on the 
purchase  of  planting  and  maintenance  of  oil  palm  plantation  and  in  harvesting,  and  ultimately  receiving  cash 
from sale of palm oil to third parties. The Group's strategy to manage this risk is to stage the replanting (20-30 
year replanting cycle) to reduce the effect on the cash flow.

These  contracts  are  fair  valued  by  comparing  the  contracted  rate  to  the  market  rates  for  contracts  with  the 
same  length  of  maturity.    All  movements  in  fair  value  are  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  in  the  period  they 
occur.  The net fair value losses on foreign currency derivatives during the year were $1.010 million for the 
Group (2015: loss of $0.515 million). There were no outstanding forward exchange contracts as at 30 June 
2016. 
 
The  group  uses  various  methods  in  estimating  the  fair  value  of  a  financial  instrument.  The  methods 
comprise: 
 
Level 1: the fair value is calculated using quoted price in active markets; 
Level 2: the fair value is estimated using inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are
0.7845
-
observable for the assets or liability, either directly (as price) or indirectly (derived from prices);  
and
Level 3: the fair value is estimated using inputs for the assets or liability that are not based on observable
market data.

amount of $606,000 during the year ended 30 June 2016 (2015: $829,000).
Provision for decommissioning
Based  on  the  Mining  Lease  Agreement  between  the  Commonwealth  Government  and  Phosphate 
Resources Limited a provision for decommissioning has been recognised for costs associated with: 
-  Demolition of all improvements specified for the removal of all debris resulting from demolition, 
removal of plant and equipment and leaving the leased land in a safe, clean and tidy condition at 
the expiry of the lease.
Estimates  of  the  decommissioning  obligations  are  based  on  anticipated  technology  and  legal 
requirements and future costs, which have been discounted to their present value.  In determining the 
decommissioning provision, the entity has assumed no significant changes will occur in the relevant 
Federal and State legislation in relation to demolition of such mines in the future.

The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise receivables, payables, finance leases, cash and short-term 
deposits, long-term deposits, interest bearing loans and borrowings, and foreign exchange derivatives. 
 
Market, liquidity and credit risk (including foreign exchange, commodity price and interest rate risk) arise in the 
normal course of the Group’s business. 
 
The Group manages its exposure to key financial risks, including interest rate, currency and commodity risk in 
accordance with the Group's risk management procedures. The overall objective of these procedures is to: 
• 
• 
• 
 
The Group continually monitors its forecast financial position against these criteria.
Ensure that net cash flows are sufficient to meet all financial commitments as and when they fall due. 
Support the delivery of the Group's financial targets whilst protecting future financial security. 
Minimise the potential adverse effects resulting from volatility on financial markets.
Annual Report – 30 June 2016

CI RESOURCES LIMITED 
 
Notes to the financial statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2016 
 
It  is,  and  has  been  throughout  the  period  under  review,  Group  policy  that  no  speculative  trading  in  financial 
instruments be undertaken 
 
 (i) Interest rate risk 
 
The  Group’s  exposure  to  market  interest  rates  relates  primarily  to  the  Group’s  long  term  debt  obligations. 
Interest  rate  risk  on  cash  and  short  term  deposits  is  not  considered  to  be  a  material  risk  due  to  the  short  term 
nature of these financial instruments. 
 
The interest rates for term deposits are fixed and there is no material risk for interest bearing assets. There is no 
other  financial  asset  or  liability  bearing  interest  rate  risk  except  for  interest  bearing  loans  and  borrowings,  the 
sensitivity of which is disclosed below. 
 
The following sensitivity analysis is based on the interest rate risk exposures in existence at the reporting date: 
 
At  30  June  2016,  if  interest  rates  had  moved,  as  illustrated  in  the  table  below,  with  all  other  variables  held 
constant, post-tax profit and equity would have been affected as follows:
Judgments of reasonably possible movements: 
Post tax profit

-1.0% (100 basis points)
Higher/(Lower)
2016
$’000s
2015 
$’000s
- 
-
- 
-
Reasonable possible movements in interest rates were determined based on the Group’s mix of debt in Australia 
and foreign countries, relationship with financial institutions and review of last two years’ historical movements 
and economic forecaster’s expectations. 
 
CI Resources, both parent and group, is exposed to interest rate risks in Australia. To minimise the effects of the 
potential adversities, the management attempt to limit these effects through constant reviewing of the financial 
markets. 
 
(ii) Liquidity Risk 
 
The  Group’s  liquidity  position  is  managed  to  ensure  that  sufficient  funds  are  available  to  meet  its  financial 
commitments in a timely and cost effective manner. 
 
Management monitors the Group’s liquidity reserve on the basis of expected cash flow. The table below reflects 
a balanced view of cash inflows and outflows and shows the implied risk based on those values. Trade payables 
and  other  financial  liabilities  originate  from  the  financing  of  assets  used  in  the  Group’s  ongoing  operations. 
These assets are considered in the Group's overall liquidity risk. 
 
Management  continually  reviews  the  Group  liquidity  position  including  cash  flow  forecasts  to  determine  the 
forecast liquidity position and maintain appropriate liquidity levels.

(iii) Credit risk 
 
Credit risk is the risk that a contracting entity will not complete its obligation under a financial instrument that 
will  result  in  a  financial  loss  to  the  Group.  The  carrying  amount  of  financial  assets  represents  the  maximum 
credit exposure.
Financial  instruments  that  potentially  subject  the  consolidated  entity  to  concentrations  of  credit  risk  consist 
principally of cash deposits and receivables. The Group places its cash deposits and derivatives with high credit-
quality financial institutions.  Receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the results that the 
Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant.  
 
(iv) Derivative instruments and foreign currency risk 
 
The  Group’s  future  revenues  are  exposed  to  movements  in  foreign  exchange  rates,  particularly  the  US 
dollar/Australian  dollar  rate.  The  Group  may  from  time  to  time  enter  into  foreign  exchange  derivative 
instruments to manage this exposure. 
 
The Group has, as outlined in note 16, forward currency contracts designated as held for trading that are subject 
to fair value movements through profit or loss as foreign exchange rates move.

Notes to the financial statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2016 
 
 
At 30 June 2016, had the Australian Dollar moved, as illustrated in the table below, with all other variables held 
constant, post-tax profit and equity would have been affected as follows:

Management  believes  the  balance  date  risk  exposures  are  representative  of  the  risk  exposure  inherent  in  the 
financial instruments. 
 
Significant assumptions used in the foreign currency exposure sensitivity analysis include:
-  Reasonably possible movements in foreign exchange rates were determined based on a review of the
last two years historical movements.
-  The  net  exposure  at  balance  date  is  representative  of  what  the  Group  was  and  is  expecting  to  be
exposed to in the next twelve months from balance date.
(v) Fair values 
 
The  Directors  have  performed  a  review  of  the  financial  assets  and  liabilities  as  at  30  June  2016  and  have 
concluded  that  the  fair  value  of  those  assets  and  liabilities  are  not  materially  different  to  book  values.  The 
methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments were: 
•  Cash - The carrying amount is fair value due to the liquid nature of these assets. 
•  Receivables/payables  -  due  to  the  short  term  nature  of  these  financial  rights  and  obligations,  and/or
market interest received/paid, their carrying values are estimated to represent their fair values.
•  Derivatives - The fair values of forward currency contracts are calculated by reference to current forward
exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
•  Finance lease liability – The fair value is the present value of minimum lease payments. 
•  Bank loan – All the bank loans of the Group are interest bearing with floating interest rates which move 
in accordance with the market interest rates. Therefore the fair value of the bank loans approximates their 
carrying value.
•  Term deposits – The carrying values of term deposits represent the fair values.
Capital risk management 
 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard their ability to continue as a going concern, so 
that they can continue to provide shareholders and stakeholders in the future and to  maintain an optimal capital 
structure to reduce the cost of capital. 
 
Management  are  constantly  adjusting  the  capital  structure  as  suitable.  As  the  market  is  constantly  changing, 
management  may change the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to  shareholders or issue 
new shares. 
 
Management have no current plans to issue further shares on the market.

Independent auditor's report to the members of CI Resources Limited
Report on the financial report
We have audited the accompanying financial report of CI Resources Limited, which comprises the
consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement
of cash flows for the year then ended, notes comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and
other explanatory information, and the directors' declaration of the consolidated entity comprising the
company and the entities it controlled at the year's end or from time to time during the financial year.
Directors' responsibility for the financial report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true
and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for
such internal controls as the directors determine are necessary to enable the preparation of the financial
report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In Note 2, the directors also
state, in accordance with Accounting Standard AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements, that the
financial statements comply with International Financial Reporting Standards.
Auditor's responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. We conducted our
audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we comply with
relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the financial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error. In making
those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal controls relevant to the entity's preparation and fair
presentation of the financial report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's
internal controls. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and
the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
audit opinion.
Independence
In conducting our audit we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations Act
2001.  We have given to the directors of the company a written Auditor’s Independence Declaration, a
copy of which is included in the directors’ report.
