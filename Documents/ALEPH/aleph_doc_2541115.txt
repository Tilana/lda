<B>Statement Regarding This Amendment
We are amending our Form 10-QSB for the period ended March 31, 2003, as
originally filed on August 21, 2003 and amended on November 28, 2003, as a
result of comments received from the staff of the Securities and Exchange
Commission in connection with the filing of our Sch 13E-3 and Pre14A. We have
expanded the footnote disclosure related to SFAS 143 and made other
modifications to the footnotes. In addition, we have restated the manner in
which we accounted for our asset retirement obligation/well plugging reserve. In
all other material respects, this Amended Quarterly Report on Form 10-QSB/A is
unchanged from the Quarterly Report on Form 10-QSB previously filed by the
Company on November 28, 2003.</B>

VINEYARD OIL &amp; GAS COMPANY
                            NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                        MARCH 31, 2003
1.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements of Vineyard 
Oil
and Gas (the "Company") have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles for interim financial information and in accordance with
the instructions to Form 10-QSB and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly,
they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally
accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion
of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals)
considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating
results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2003 are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31,
2003. For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes
included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-KSB for the year ended
December 31, 2002.
2. RESTATEMENT AND NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUCEMENTS
In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations". SFAS 143 addresses obligations associated with the retirement of
tangible, long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. This
statement amends SFAS 19, "Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas
Producing Companies." This statement requires the Company to recognize a
liability for the fair value of its plugging and abandoning liability (excluding
salvage value) with the associated costs included as part of the Company's oil
and gas properties balance. As a result of a review of the Company's periodic
filings by the staff of the Division of Corporation Finance of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Staff"), the Company has restated its
financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2003 to expand its
disclosure of the effects of adopting SFAS 143 as of January 1, 2003, and to
recognize the effects of the adoption of SFAS 143. The material unaudited
affects of the adoption, as of January 1, 2003, are as follows:

         Total Shareholders' Equity         987,054                 515,641
On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS 145, "Rescission of FASB
Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB statement No. 13, and Technical
Corrections." SFAS 145 rescinds SFAS 4, "Reporting Gains and Losses from
Extinguishment of Debt, " SFAS 44, "Accounting for Intangibe Assets of Motor
Carriers" and SFAS 64, "Extinguishments of Debt made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund
Requirements" and amends SFAS No. 13, "Accounting for Leases." Statement 145
7
also makes technical corrections to other existing pronouncements. SFAS 4
required gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be classified as an
extraordinary item, net of the related income tax effect. As a result of the
rescission of SFAS 4, the criteria for extraordinary items in Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. (APB) 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations -
Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary,
Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions," now will be used
to classify those gains and losses. The adoption of SFAS 145 did not have any
effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities." SFAS 146 is effective for the Company for
disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The adoption of this
standard did not have any effect on the Company's financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.
In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 45,
"Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others". FIN 45's disclosure requirements
are effective for the Company's interim and annual financial statements for
periods ended after December 15, 2002. The initial recognition and measurement
provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or
modified after December 31, 2002. FIN 45 requires certain guarantees to be
recorded at fair value, which is different from current practice, which is
generally to record a liability only when a loss is probable and reasonably
estimable. FIN 45 also requires a guarantor to make significant new disclosures
even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote.
Adoption of FIN 45 did not have any effect on the Company's financial statement
disclosures, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation - Transition and Disclosure." SFAS 148 amends FASB 123, "Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation," to provide alternative methods of transition for
a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation. In addition, SFAS 148 amends the disclosure requirements
of SFAS 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim
financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation and the effect of the method used on the reported results. The
provisions of SFAS 148 are effective for financial statements for fiscal years
ended after December 15, 2002. The adoption of SFAS 148 did not have any effect
on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flow.
In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, "Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities - An Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) 51."
FIN 46 is an interpretation of ARB 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements," and
addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities
(VIEs). The primary objective of FIN 46 is to provide guidance on the
identification of, and financial reporting for, entities over which control is
achieved through means other than voting rights; such entities are known as
VIEs. FIN 46 requires an enterprise to consolidate a VIE if that enterprise has
a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entity's expected losses
if they occur, receive a majority of the entity's expected residual returns if
8
they occur or both. An enterprise shall consider the rights and obligations
conveyed by its variable interests in making this determination. This guidance
applies immediately to VIEs created after January 31, 2003, and to VIEs in which
an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. It applies in the first
fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, to VIEs in which an
enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003.
Adoption of FIN 46 did not have any effect on the Company's financial statement
disclosures, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
3. PRIOR PERIOD ADJUSTMENTS
Since 1990, the Company, as general partner, has withheld from prior 
years'
quarterly partnership distributions an estimated fee for future well plugging
charges. The plugging fees were recorded as deferred revenue until the actual
plugging costs had been incurred by the partnerships. However, under SFAS 19,
the Company estimated that the salvage values of its properties were sufficient
to offset its liabilities with respect to plugging the wells and as a result the
Company has now determined that the deferral of this revenue was not
appropriate. As such, the Company has restated its January 1, 2001 retained
earnings and equity by $362,776 to account for the cumulative effect of this
restatement as of December 31, 2000. In addition, the Company has restated its
financial statements for 2002 to account for the affect of amounts received in
2002 that should have been recorded as income during 2002. The following sets
forth the affects of the restatement on 2002 as well as years prior to January
1, 2001 where there would have been a material effect of this restatement:

weighted average number of common shares outstanding (5,325,562.50 in 2003 and
2002).
5.       INCOME TAX
No federal income tax was due or paid during the periods ended March 31,
2003, and 2002, due to available operating loss carry forwards.
6.       REVENUE RECOGNITION
Oil and gas production is recognized as production and delivery takes 
place. Gas
marketing revenues are recognized, inclusive of transportation costs, when title
passes. Field service revenues are recognized when the goods or services have
been provided.
7.       CASH FLOW INFORMATION
For purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash includes demand 
deposits,
certificates of deposit, and short-term investments with original maturities of
three months or less.

9. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION
Description of the types of products and services from which each
reportable segment derives its revenue:
The Company's three reportable business segments are gas marketing, well
services and equipment rental and oil and gas production.
The Company's gas marketing operation involves marketing gas from local
producers and interstate pipeline sources, as well as marketing gas from the
Company's managed limited partnerships, and selling that gas to industrial gas
users through transportation arrangements on intrastate and interstate pipeline
systems.
In the well services and equipment rental operation, the Company rents
well service equipment (e.g. for use in water hauling, pipeline installation,
and welding) and provides workover and well tending services for producing
wells.
Revenues from oil and gas production operations are primarily derived
from working and royalty interests in the sale of oil and gas production and
for the transmission of such production.
11
Measurement of segment profit or loss and segment assets
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described 
in
the summary of significant accounting policies included in the Company's Annual
Report on Form 10-KSB for the year ended December 31, 2002 and in Notes 1 and 2
to the Condensed Financial Statements included in Item 1. of this Report. The
Company evaluates performance based on profit and loss from operations before
income taxes not including nonrecurring gains and losses.
The Company accounts for intersegment sales and transfers as if the
sales or transfers were to third parties, that is, at current market prices.
Factors management used to identify the Company's reportable segments
The Company's reportable segments are strategic business units that offer
different products and services.  They are managed separately because each
segment requires different technology and marketing strategies.
The Company's segment profit or loss and assets are as follows:
Well Services
               Gas            and Equipment  Oil &amp; Gas    All

Revenue from segments below quantitative thresholds are attributed to
the Company's equity in earnings of its jointly-owned company and unallocated
revenues such as interest income and gains recognized on the disposition of
assets.  General and administrative expenses are not allocated to the
Company's three business segments.  This activity is reported as "All Others".
10.  CONTINGENCIES
In February 2003, the Company's marketing segment underdelivered a small
percentage of its customers' natural gas requirements. As a result of abnormally
high gas consumption combined with related production constraints, the local gas
utility company, National Fuel Distribution Company ("NFDC") supplied the 
customers'
needs. The Company was invoiced $505,307 by NFDC for the underdelivered amount.
Additional charges were incurred by Vineyard's customers in the amount of
$187,687. These charges are a contracted responsibility of the Company's
"pooled" producers, who market natural gas through the Company by yearly
contract.
The Company filed a complaint with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission,
disputing the amount invoiced by NFDC. In an effort to settle the dispute, NFDC
made a settlement offer, reducing the charged amount by over 40%. At March 31,
2003, Vineyard included in accounts payable an estimate of the liability of
$432,417 and simultaneously recorded a receivable from the pool producers
associated with the charges.
Negotiations have continued during 2003 and, as of September 30, 2003, Vineyard
had revised the estimated liability to $254,621. Subsequently, the Company made
a partial good-faith payment of $150,000. In January 2004, a final settlement
was reached with all parties involved. A final payment of $104,621 was made by
the Company and all amounts receivable from the pool producers have been
recovered.
On May 19, 2003, the Company filed suit against one of its customers for
breach of contract. The Company's complaint involves three unpaid invoices
totaling $108,334 for natural gas deliveries that occurred in compliance with
the contractual agreement executed with the customer. The customer has filed a
counterclaim alleging "cost to cover" issues in the amount of $183,238. Total
exposure to the Company could be as high as $291,572, the combination of the
possible negative impact of both claims. In the opinion of management, the suit
should result in a settlement or award by the court in favor of the Company and
adequate provision has been made for any loss that management currently
anticipates may be incurred in settlement. At this time, however, no estimate
can be made as to the timing of the settlement of this matter.

ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION
                          QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2003
Material Changes in Financial Condition
Vineyard Oil &amp; Gas Company's cash position increased $916,654 during
the quarter ended March 31, 2003, primarily as a result of net cash provided by
operating activities of $906,410. Of that amount, accounts receivable and
accounts payable increases resulted in a net increase of $1,344,763. The
quarter's net loss of $1,226,700 which included non-cash charges for
depreciation, amortization and accretion of $882,802, reduced operational cash
flow.
Revenues increased $6,448,813 for the three month period ended March 31,
2003, over the same three month period in 2002. Gas marketing revenue increased
by $6,605,881 in this period, by far the most significant change of all the
business segments. The increase in gas marketing revenue resulted from a
combination of price and volume increases. Market prices in the three month
period ended March 31, 2003 were significantly higher (in excess of two to three
times higher) than market prices for the same period in 2002. The price increase
was coupled with a volume increase of approximately 30% in 2003 over the same
period in 2002. Well services and equipment rental and service income decreased
a total of $221,324 over the same period last year. The most significant reason
for the decline in revenue was a large pipeline project that was completed in
the first quarter of 2002. This significant project accounted for approximately
$230,000 in gross revenue in 2002. Production and Royalties increased $37,550
over the prior period due mainly to a combination of price and volume. In order
to take advantage of the price increases noted above, the Company increased gas
and oil production. Equity in earnings of a jointly-owned company (Northern
Pipeline, LLC.) increased by $23,062 in 2003. The increase is attributable to an
increase in the gathering fee charged and an increase in volume through the
pipeline.
Cost of revenues increased $7,067,663 over the similar period in 2002. 
Gas
purchases increased by $7,216,110. Significant increases in expenses are related
to the increase in gas prices noted above. The profit margin deteriorated in
2003 resulting in a business segment loss of $287,395. The decrease in margin is
related to unscheduled demand. Below normal temperatures for the period sparked
higher than anticipated consumption, forcing the Company to cover volume demand
by purchasing gas in the cash market. These prices were significantly higher and
in most cases exceeded contracted prices with the customers. Well services and
Equipment Rental expenses decreased $149,610 from the prior year. The decrease
is directly related with the pipeline project explained above. Production
expenses increased by $23,346 in 2003. As mentioned, to take advantage of
increased prices the Company increased production, which resulted in higher
expenses.
14
The effects of SFAS 143 totaled $866,056 as of March 31, 2003 (see Note 
2
to the Condensed Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Report).
Accretion expense in 2003 totaled $585,063 with $16,993 affecting the current
period and the balance of $568,070 reported as the cumulative effect.
Depreciation expenses totaled $280,993 for the same period with $5,302 affecting
the current period and the balance of $275,691 reported as the cumulative
effect.
General and administrative expenses decreased $43,376 from the similar
period in 2002. The majority of these expenses reflected reductions from the
same period in 2002. The more significant decreases related to accounting fees,
salaries, payroll taxes and travel/entertainment.
A net loss of $1,226,700 represents a decrease of $1,457,905 over the
income of $231,205 in the same period in 2002. The schedule of segment profit
and loss shows the changes by business segment. The gas marketing segment
suffered a loss of $287,395 as a result of a margin decrease of $610,229 from
the same period in 2002. As explained above, the deterioration in margin was due
to higher then normal costs to purchase gas. Well services and equipment rental
produced a segment loss of $24,499 as margins decreased by $72,079 from 2002.
Removing the profit impact of the large pipeline project (approximately $67,000)
explained above, an increase in several overhead expenses is the reason for the
decrease in margin. Production reported a segment loss of $791,645 down $853,352
from the prior year. Predominately, the cumulative effects of FASB 143 are
responsible for the margin loss (see note 2 to the Condensed Financial
Statements included in Item 1 of this Report). All other costs, net of other
revenue, resulted in a segment loss of $123,161 for 2003. This shows a margin
improvement of $77,755 from 2002. The improvement is the result of increased
other revenue and control of expenses.
ITEM 3.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, the 
Company
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of
the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
the Company's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule
13a-15.  Based upon the evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly
report.  During the quarter ended March 31, 2003, there have been no changes in
the Company's internal controls over financial reporting, identified in
connection with our evaluation thereof, that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
