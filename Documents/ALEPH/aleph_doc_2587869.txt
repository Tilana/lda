CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Mr. Wang Yupu, Chairman
Dear shareholders and friends,
Thank you for the trust and support that you and the Board of Directors have on me, I am honored to be elected to serve as Director and
Chairman of the Sixth Session of Board of Directors of Sinopec Corp. in May this year. On behalf of the new session of the Board, I would like to
express my sincere gratitude to all of you.
Since its debut on the capital market in 2000, with the support from our shareholders and the society at large, Sinopec Corp. has, over the past 15
years, continuously improved its corporate governance, expanded its business and enhanced its competitiveness by riding on the rapid growth of
Chinese market, leveraging its integrated advantages, and deepening reform and continuous commitment to excellence. In the first half of this
year, despite the slowdown of domestic economy and low oil prices, the Company managed to navigate through the challenging and
complicated market environment and achieved solid operating results.
In the first half of 2015, the total turnover and other operating revenue under IFRS was RMB 1,040.4 billion, 23.3% lower than the same period of
last year. Profit attributable to shareholders of the company was RMB 25.4 billion, 22% lower than the same period of last year. Equity attributable
to shareholders of the Company increased by 14.7% and the liability-to-asset ratio was down by 9.04 percentage points. Taking into
consideration of our cash flow, future development and shareholders’ interest, the Board of Directors declared an interim dividend of RMB 0.09
per share, unchanged from the same period of last year. Total dividend to be paid will amount to RMB 10.896 billion, up by RMB 384 million from
the same period of last year.
Sinopec has entered into a new historical era. The Company is facing challenges from the changing global political and economic landscape,
the shifting of growth engine in Chinese economy, and volatilities in the industry and the market. But at the same time, the Company also has
unprecedent growth opportunities. The Company is drafting its 13th Five-Year-Plan. We’ll proactively adapt to the New Normals in China’s
economic growth and the mega-trend of the world’s economy and the business cycle. We will prioritise on reforms, consolidation of resources,
integrated operations, innovation and value creation. We will further develop our growth strategies to seize the opportunities arising from the
nation’s strategic initiatives which include the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, the Coordinated Development of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei, the
development of Yangtze River Economic Zone and the Made in China 2025 plan.
The Company will focus more on reforms. We will prepare our overall reform plan by using the top-down procedure, focusing on the
enhancement of operating and management efficiency, labor productivity and efficiency of the state-owned capital. Meanwhile, we’ll focus on the
innovation of the management system and mechanism, promoting integrated operations, professional management and market-oriented
operation with an objective of strengthening dynamics and competitiveness of the Company.
The Company will focus more on consolidation of resources. We will enhance our ability to access resources, which comprises of conventional
oil and gas resources and unconventional ones such as shale gas; energy resources such as refined oil products, chemicals and coal etc, as
well as strategic resources such as terminals, storage facilities and pipelines. We will further expand our market resources by leveraging the
unique domestic market potentials to strengthen the Company’s capability of mobilising resources both at home and abroad. We will effectively
consolidate resources of technology, talent and Big Data to establish a strategic resource management system and lay a solid foundation for the
growth of the Company.
 
 
 
8
The Company will focus more on integrated operations, the business model that we adopted since the Restructuring of Sinopec Corp.. It is a
strategic advantage for us to address various difficulties and challenges. Going forward, with the aim to maximise the overall value of the
Company, through market-oriented approaches, we will implement integrated operations and professional management, facilitate the
optimisation of resources across business segments, regions and subsidiaries, promote the coordinated development of both traditional and
emerging businesses and enhance overall competitiveness of the company.
The Company will focus more on innovations. We will deploy our chain of innovation initiatives along the business chain and improve our
funding chain along the innovation chain. The Company will promote innovation in science and technology, management, business model, and
financial services to release the driving and multiplier effect of innovations, and accelerate the upgrading and improvement of our core
businesses.
The Company will focus more on value creation. We will be committed to value creation and improvement throughout the complete process of
corporate reform and development, production and operation, as well as corporate management, which comprises of economic, social and
cultural values. Economic value creation means performance accretion, which will bring long-term sustainable value addition in corporate capital
and assets. To create social value is to assume the role of a corporate citizen and be committed to safe production, environment protection and
social responsibilities to promote green, low-carbon, healthy and sustainable growth. To enrich cultural value is to promote the honorable legacy
from Chinese oil and petrochemical industry, including full commitment and dedication, together with a positive working style of “Stringent,
Meticulous and Solid”. Value creation in economic, social and cultural aspects will be supportive to each other and collectively promote the
progress of both the Company and the society.
We will formulate the corporate strategies in consideration of the overall economic and social development. Taking resource consolidation as the
foundation, reform and innovation as the driving force, and integrated operations and value creation as the measures, we will make Sinopec
stronger and better in development quality and bigger in development space with the dedication to enhancing the growth potential of the
Company, contributing to the nation, rewarding our shareholders, serving the society and benefiting our employees.
Sinopec is equipped with abundant resources, a professional and capable management team and dedicated employees. I am confident that we
will work closely as a team to lead Sinopec to a brighter future. We are looking forward to the continuous support from our shareholders and the
society as a whole. With your whole-hearted support, our Board of Directors and management team will continue to be highly diligent,
responsible and dedicated to leading our employees to achieve a sustainable and healthy growth of the Company, and creating better returns for
the nation, our shareholders and employees and the society at large.

BUSINESS PROSPECTS
Looking into the second half, the world’s economy is expected to recover slowly. China’s economy will maintain its steady growth. With a general
over supply situation of international crude oil market, the oil price is expected to fluctuate at a low level. Domestic demand for oil and gas is
anticipated to grow. The overall demand for oil products and chemicals will grow steadily with the consumption mix to be further adjusted. Given
n the current state, the Company will undertake initiatives in the following key areas.
In exploration and development, we will step up new technology development and application to promote progressive exploration and reservoir
evaluation in oil-rich sag in East China, Tahe oil field and the west rim of Junggar Basin. In natural gas development, we will promote the
development and assessment in the gas fields of Erdos, Sichuan basin and Songliao Basin, and push ahead with Fuling shale gas field
development so as to deliver the 1st phase capacity building target of 5 billion cubic meters. In the second half of the year, we expect to produce
177 million barrels of crude oil and 537 billion cubic feet of natural gas.
In refining, we will continue to adopt a market-oriented and profitability-driven strategy, optimise production plan and ensure safe and stable
operations. We will fine-tune crude oil resources allocation to lower crude cost, and accelerate oil products quality upgrading. The Company will
actively expand marketing of lubricants, LPG and asphalt. Meanwhile, we will actively control costs to improve cost competitiveness. We plan to
process 122.7 million tonnes of crude oil in the second half.
In marketing and distribution, we will intensify market analysis and forecast to ensure both sales volume growth and profitability, optimise
resource structure to consolidate and expand market share, and put customers first by adopting more proactive retail strategies to stabilise direct
sales and distribution volume. We will continuously push forward a market-oriented and specialised development in non-fuel business,
strengthen key products marketing and procurement management, and promote transformation from an oil products supplier to a comprehensive
service provider. In the second half, we plan to sell 87 million tonnes of refined oil products in the domestic market.
In chemicals, we will proactively adjust the product mix, promote new products R&D in line with expanded production and sales. We will fine-
tune the operations of facilities at reasonable utilisation rate and continuously to reduce optimise feedstock mix cost. Meanwhile, we will deepen
the inter links amongst production, marketing, research and product application, enhance our marketing strategy and improve customer services.
In the second half, we plan to produce 5.6 million tonnes of ethylene.
In the second half, we’ll fully leverage our advantages across the integrated value chain, arrange production and operation for maximum
profitability, spare no efforts in expanding market, and intensely keep the cost and expenses under control. We will ensure HSE performance,
strengthen our capability in sustainable development and strive for better operating results. In the meantime, we will adapt to and capture the
opportunities of the new normals of Chinese economic growth, and set forth the 13th five-year plan of the company.

Most of the crude oil and a small portion of the natural gas produced by the exploration and production segment were used for the Company’s
refining and chemical operations. Most of the natural gas and a small portion of the crude oil produced by the Company were sold to external
customers.
In the first half of 2015, operating revenue of the segment was RMB 70.4 billion, representing a decrease of 38.2% over the first half of 2014. This
was mainly due to the decline of crude oil prices compared with the same period of last year.
In the first half of 2015, the segment sold 21.24 million tonnes of crude oil, representing a decrease of 1.5%; 9.49 billion cubic meters of natural
gas, representing an increase of 7.5% over the first half of 2014. The average realised selling price of crude oil and natural gas were RMB 2,147
per tonne and RMB 1,589 per thousand cubic meters, representing a decrease of 48.0% and an increase of 4.6% respectively over the same
period of 2014.
In the first half of 2015, the operating expenses of the segment were RMB 72.2 billion, representing a decrease of 15.6% over the first half of
2014. This was mainly due to the following:
‧Due to the increases of investments of oil and gas properties, the depreciation and depletion increased RMB 0.6 billion compared with the same
period of 2014;
‧Due to the decline of crude oil prices, special oil income levy, resources tax and other taxes decreased RMB 14.4 billion compared with the
same period of 2014.
In the first half of 2015, lifting cost was RMB 711 per tonne of oil equivalent, representing a year-on-year decrease of 2.5%, this was mainly due to
the strict control over costs and expenses.
The operating loss of this segment was RMB 1.8 billion in the first half of 2015, representing a decrease of RMB 30.1 billion in operating profit
compared with the same period of 2014 due to the sharp decline of the international crude oil prices.

3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The  Group  determines  specific  accounting  policies  and  accounting  estimates  based  on  the  characteristics  of  production  and  operational
activities, mainly reflected in the accounting for allowance for accounts receivable (Note 3(12)), valuation of inventories (Note 3(4)), depreciation
of fixed assets and oil and gas properties (Note 3(6), (7)), measurement of provisions (Note 3(16)), ie.
Principal accounting estimates and judgements of the Group are set out in Note 51.
(1)Accounting treatment of business combination involving entities under common control and not under common control
(a) Business combination involving entities under common control
 A business combination involving entities or businesses under common control is a business combination in which all of the combining entities
or  businesses  are  ultimately  controlled  by  the  same  party  or  parties  both  before  and  after  the  business  combination,  and  that  control  is  not
transitory. The assets and liabilities that the acquirer receives in the acquisition are accounted for at the acquiree’s carrying amount on the
acquisition date. The difference between the carrying amount of the acquired net assets and the carrying amount of the consideration paid for the
acquisition (or the total nominal value of shares issued) is recognised in the share premium of capital reserve, or the retained earnings in case of
any shortfall in the share premium of capital reserve. Any costs directly attributable to the combination shall be recognised in profit or loss for the
current period when occurred. The expense incurred for equity securities and debt securities issued as the consideration of the combination is
recognised in the initial cost of the securities. The combination date is the date on which the acquirer effectively obtains control of the acquiree.
(b) Business combination involving entities not under common control
 A business combination involving entities or businesses not under common control is a business combination in which all of the combining
entities  or  businesses  are  not  ultimately  controlled  by  the  same  party  or  parties  both  before  and  after  the  business  combination.  Difference
between the consideration paid by the Group as the acquirer, comprises of the aggregate of the fair value at the acquisition date of assets given,
including equity interest of the acquiree held before the acquisition date, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity securities issued by the
acquirer  in  exchange  for  control  of  the  acquiree,  and  the  Group’s  interest  in  the  fair  value  of  the  identifiable  net  assets  of  the  acquiree,  is
recognised as goodwill (Note 3(9)) if it is an excess, otherwise in the profit or loss. The expense incurred for equity securities and debt securities
issued as the consideration of the combination is recognised in the initial cost of the securities. Any other expense directly attributable to the
business combination is recognised in the profit or loss for the period. The difference between the fair value and the book value of the assets
given is recognised in profit or loss. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, if satisfying the recognition criteria, are
recognised by the Group at their fair value at the acquisition date. The acquisition date is the date on which the acquirer effectively obtains
control of the acquiree.
(c) Method for preparation of consolidated financial statements
 The scope of consolidated financial statements is based on control and the consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its
subsidiaries. Control means an entity is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to
affect  those  returns  through  its  power  over  the  entity.  The  financial  statements  of  subsidiaries  are  included  in  the  consolidated  financial
statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Where  the  Company  combines  a  subsidiary  during  the  reporting  period  through  a  business  combination  involving  entities  under  common
control, the financial statements of the subsidiary are included in the consolidated financial statements as if the combination had occurred at the
beginning  of  the  earliest  comparative  year  presented  or,  if  later,  at  the  date  that  common  control  was  established.  Therefore  the  opening
balances  and  the  comparative  figures  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  are  restated.  In  the  preparation  of  the  consolidated  financial
statements, the subsidiary’s assets, liabilities and results of operations are included in the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated
income statement, respectively, based on their carrying amounts in the subsidiary’s financial statements, from the date that common control was
established.
Where  the  Company  acquires  a  subsidiary  during  the  reporting  year  through  a  business  combination  involving  entities  not  under  common
control, the identifiable assets, liabilities and results of operations of the subsidiaries are consolidated into consolidated financial statements
from the date that control commences, based on the fair value of those identifiable assets and liabilities at the acquisition date.
Where the Company acquired a minority interest from a subsidiary’s minority shareholders, the difference between the investment cost and the
newly acquired interest into the subsidiary’s identifiable net assets at the acquisition date is adjusted to the capital reserve (capital surplus) in the
consolidated balance sheet. Where the Company partially disposed an investment of a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control, the
difference  between  the  proceeds  and  the  corresponding  share  of  the  interest  into  the  subsidiary  is  adjusted  to  the  capital  reserve  (capital
surplus) in the consolidated balance sheet. If the credit balance of capital reserve (capital surplus) is insufficient, any excess is adjusted to
retained profits.
In a business combination involving entities not under common control achieved in stages, the Group remeasures its previously held equity
interest in the acquiree on the acquisition date. The difference between the fair value and the net book value is recognised as investment income
for the period. If other comprehensive income was recognised regarding the equity interest previously held in the acquiree before the acquisition
date, the relevant other comprehensive income is transferred to investment income in the period in which the acquisition occurs.

(1)Accounting treatment of business combination involving entities under common control and not under common control (Continued)
(c) Method for preparation of consolidated financial statements (Continued)
 Where  control  of  a  subsidiary  is  lost  due  to  partial  disposal  of  the  equity  investment  held  in  a  subsidiary,  or  any  other  reasons,  the  group
derecognises  assets,  liabilities,  minority  interests  and  other  equity  items  related  to  the  subsidiary.  The  remaining  equity  investment  is
remeasured to fair value at the date in which control is lost. The sum of consideration received from disposal of equity investment and the fair
value of the remaining equity investment, net of the fair value of the Group’s previous share of the subsidiary’s identifiable net assets recorded
from the acquisition date, is recognised in investment income in the period in which control is lost. Other comprehensive income related to the
previous equity investment in the subsidiary, is transferred to investment income when control is lost.
Minority interest is presented separately in the consolidated balance sheet within shareholders’ equity. Net profit or loss attributable to minority
shareholders is presented separately in the consolidated income statement below the net profit line item.
The excess of the loss attributable to the minority interests during the period over the minority interests’ share of the equity at the beginning of the
reporting period is deducted from minority interests.
Where the accounting policies and accounting period adopted by the subsidiaries are different from those adopted by the Company, adjustments
are made to the subsidiaries’ financial statements according to the Company’s accounting policies and accounting period. Intra-group balances
and transactions, and any unrealised profit or loss arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial
statements. Unrealised losses resulting from intra-group transactions are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains but only to the extent
that there is no evidence of impairment.
The unrealised profit or loss arising from the sale of assets by the Company to its subsidiaries is eliminated in full against the net profit attributed
to shareholders; the unrealised profit or loss from the sale of assets by subsidiaries to the Company is eliminated according to the distribution
ratio between shareholders of the parent company and minority interests. For sale of assets that occurred between subsidiaries, the unrealised
trading gains and losses is eliminated according to the distribution ratio for its subsidiaries seller between net profit attributable to shareholders
of the parent company and minority interests.
(2) Transactions in foreign currencies and translation of financial statements in foreign currencies
 Foreign currency transactions are, on initial recognition, translated into Renminbi at the spot exchange rates quoted by the People’s Bank of
China at the transaction dates.
Foreign currency monetary items are translated at the spot exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences, except for those
directly related to the acquisition, construction or production of qualified assets, are recognised as income or expenses in the income statement.
Non-monetary items denominated in foreign currency measured at historical cost are not translated. Non-monetary items denominated in foreign
currency that are measured at fair value are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. The difference
between the translated amount and the original currency amount is recognised as other comprehensive income, if it is classified as available-for-
sale financial assets; or charged to the income statement if it is measured at fair value through profit or loss.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operation are translated into Renminbi at the spot exchange rates at the balance sheet date. The equity
items,  excluding  “Retained  earnings”,  are  translated  into  Renminbi  at  the  spot  exchange  rates  at  the  transaction  dates.  The  income  and
expenses of foreign operation are translated into Renminbi at the spot exchange rates or an exchange rate that approximates the spot exchange
rates on the transaction dates. The resulting exchange differences are separately presented as other comprehensive income in the balance
sheet within equity. Upon disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of the exchange differences recognised in which relate to that
foreign operation is transferred to profit or loss in the year in which the disposal occurs.
(3)
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits, short-term and highly liquid investments which are readily convertible into
known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.
(4)
Inventories
Inventories are initially measured at cost. Cost includes the cost of purchase and processing, and other expenditures incurred in bringing the
inventories to their present location and condition. The cost of inventories is calculated using the weighted average method. In addition to the
cost  of  purchase  of  raw  material,  work  in  progress  and  finished  goods  include  direct  labour  and  an  appropriate  allocation  of  manufacturing
overhead costs.
At the balance sheet date, inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Any  excess  of  the  cost  over  the  net  realisable  value  of  each  item  of  inventories  is  recognised  as  a  provision  for  diminution  in  the  value  of
inventories. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the normal course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the
estimated costs necessary to make the sale and relevant taxes. The net realisable value of materials held for use in the production is measured
based on the net realisable value of the finished goods in which they will be incorporated. The net realisable value of the quantity of inventory
held to satisfy sales or service contracts is measured based on the contract price. If the quantities held by the Group are more than the quantities
of inventories specified in sales contracts, the net realisable value of the excess portion of inventories is measured based on general selling
prices.

Inventories (Continued)
Inventories include raw materials, work in progress, semi-finished goods, finished goods and reusable materials. Reusable materials include
low-value consumables, packaging materials and other materials, which can be used repeatedly but do not meet the definition of fixed assets.
Reusable materials are amortised in full when received for use. The amounts of the amortisation are included in the cost of the related assets or
profit or loss.
Inventories are recorded by perpetual method.

Long-term equity investments
Investment in subsidiaries
(a)
 In the Group’s consolidated financial statements, investment in subsidiaries are accounted for in accordance with the principles described in
Note 3(1) (c).
In the Company’s separate financial statements, long-term equity investments in subsidiaries are accounted for using the cost method. Except for
cash dividends or profits distributions declared but not yet distributed that have been included in the price or consideration paid in obtaining the
investments,  the  Company  recognises  its  share  of  the  cash  dividends  or  profit  distributions  declared  by  the  investee  as  investment  income
irrespective of whether these represent the net profit realised by the investee before or after the investment. Investments in subsidiaries are
stated at cost less impairment losses (see Note 3(12)) in the balance sheet. At initial recognition, such investments are measured as follows:
The initial investment cost of a long-term equity investment obtained through a business combination involving entities under common control is
the Company’s share of the carrying amount of the subsidiary’s equity at the combination date. The difference between the initial investment cost
and the carrying amounts of the consideration given is adjusted to share premium in capital reserve. If the balance of the share premium is
insufficient, any excess is adjusted to retained earnings.
For  a  long-term  equity  investment  obtained  through  a  business  combination  not  involving  enterprises  under  common  control,  the  initial
investment cost comprises the aggregate of the fair values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity securities issued by
the Company, in exchange for control of the acquiree. For a long-term equity investment obtained through a business combination not involving
enterprises under common control, if it is achieved in stages, the initial cost comprises the carrying value of previously-held equity investment in
the acquiree immediately before the acquisition date, and the additional investment cost at the acquisition date.
An investment in a subsidiary acquired otherwise than through a business combination is initially recognised at actual purchase cost if the Group
acquires the investment by cash, or at the fair value of the equity securities issued if an investment is acquired by issuing equity securities, or at
the value stipulated in the investment contract or agreement if an investment is contributed by investors.
Investment in jointly controlled entities and associates
(b)
 A joint venture is an incorporated entity over which the Group, based on legal form, contractual terms and other facts and circumstances, has
joint control with the other parties to the joint venture and rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed
sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the Group
and the parties sharing control.
An associate is the investee that the Group has significant influence on their financial and operating policies. Significant influence represents the
right to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over the establishment of these
policies.  The  Group  generally  considers  the  following  circumstances  in  determining  whether  it  can  exercise  significant  influence  over  the
investee: whether there is representative appointed to the board of directors or equivalent governing body of the investee; whether to participate
in the investee’s policy-making process; whether there are significant transactions with the investees; whether there is management personnel
sent to the investee; whether to provide critical technical information to the investee.
An investment in a jointly controlled entity or an associate is accounted for using the equity method, unless the investment is classified as held
for sale (see Note 3(10)).
The initial cost of investment in jointly controlled entities and associates is stated at the consideration paid except for cash dividends or profits
distributions declared but unpaid at the time of acquisition and therefore included in the consideration paid should be deducted if the investment
is made in cash, or at the fair value of the non-monetary assets exchanged for the investment. The difference between the fair value of the non-
monetary assets being exchanged and its carrying amount is charged to profit or loss.
 
 
 
48
3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
(5)Long-term equity investments (Continued)
Investment in jointly controlled entities and associates (Continued)
(b)
  The Group’s accounting treatments when adopting the equity method include:
Where the initial investment cost of a long-term equity investment exceeds the Group’s interest in the fair value of the investee’s identifiable net
assets at the date of acquisition, the investment is initially recognised at the initial investment cost. Where the initial investment cost is less than
the Group’s interest in the fair value of the investee’s identifiable net assets at the time of acquisition, the investment is initially recognised at the
investor’s share of the fair value of the investee’s identifiable net assets, and the difference is charged to profit or loss.
After the acquisition of the investment, the Group recognises its share of the investee’s net profits or losses and other comprehensive income, as
investment  income  or  losses  and  other  comprehensive  income,  and  adjusts  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investment  accordingly.  Once  the
investee declares any cash dividends or profits distributions, the carrying amount of the investment is reduced by that attributable to the Group.
The Group recognises its share of the investee’s net profits or losses after making appropriate adjustments to align the accounting policies or
accounting periods with those of the Group based on the fair values of the investee’s net identifiable assets at the time of acquisition. Under the
equity accounting method, unrealised profits and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and its associates or jointly controlled
entities  are  eliminated  to  the  extent  of  the  Group’s  interest  in  the  associates  or  jointly  controlled  entities.  Unrealised  losses  resulting  from
transactions between the Group and its associates or jointly controlled entities are fully recognised in the event that there is an evidence of
impairment.
The Group discontinues recognising its share of net losses of the investee after the carrying amount of the long-term equity investment and any
long-term interest that is in substance forms part of the Group’s net investment in the associate or the jointly controlled entity is reduced to zero,
except to the extent that the Group has an obligation to assume additional losses. However, if the Group has incurred obligations for additional
losses and the conditions on recognition of provision are satisfied in accordance with the accounting standard on contingencies, the Group
continues recognising the investment losses and the provision. Where net profits are subsequently made by the associate or jointly controlled
entity, the Group resumes recognising its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equals the share of losses not recognised.
The Group adjusts the carrying amount of the long-term equity investment for changes in owners’ equity of the investee other than those arising
from net profits or losses and other comprehensive income, and recognises the corresponding adjustment in equity.
(c) The impairment assessment method and provision accrual on investment
 The impairment assessment and provision accrual on investments in subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled enterprises are stated in
Note 3(12).
(6)Fixed assets and construction in progress
 Fixed assets represent the tangible assets held by the Group using in the production of goods, rendering of services and for operation and
administrative purposes with useful life over one year.
Fixed assets are stated in the balance sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses (see Note 3(12)). Construction in
progress is stated in the balance sheet at cost less impairment losses (see Note 3(12)).
The cost of a purchased fixed asset comprises the purchase price, related taxes, and any directly attributable expenditure for bringing the asset
to working condition for its intended use. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour, capitalised borrowing
costs  (see  Note  3(19)),  and  any  other  costs  directly  attributable  to  bringing  the  asset  to  working  condition  for  its  intended  use.  Costs  of
dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which the related assets located are included in the initial cost.
Construction  in  progress  is  transferred  to  fixed  assets  when  the  asset  is  ready  for  its  intended  use.  No  depreciation  is  provided  against
construction in progress.
Where the individual component parts of an item of fixed asset have different useful lives or provide benefits to the Group in different patterns
thus necessitating use of different depreciation rates or methods, each part is recognised as a separate fixed asset.
The subsequent costs including the cost of replacing part of an item of fixed assets are recognised in the carrying amount of the item if the
recognition criteria are satisfied, and the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of fixed
assets are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
The Group terminates the recognition of an item of fixed asset when it is in a state of disposal or it is estimated that it is unable to generate any
economic benefits through use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from the retirement or disposal of an item of fixed asset are determined as the
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item and are recognised in profit or loss on the date of retirement or
disposal.
 
 
 
49
3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
(6)Fixed assets and construction in progress (Continued)
 Other than oil and gas properties, the cost of fixed assets less residual value and accumulated impairment losses is depreciated using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, unless the fixed asset is classified as held for sale (see Note 3(10)). The estimated useful
lives and the estimated rate of residual values adopted for respective classes of fixed assets are as follows:
Plants and buildings
Equipment, machinery and others
Estimated useful life
12-50 years
4-30 years
Estimated rate of
residual value
3%
3%
Useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed at least each year end.
(7)Oil and gas properties
 Oil and gas properties include the mineral interests in properties, wells and related support equipment arising from oil and gas exploration and
production activities.
Costs  incurred  in  acquiring  mineral  interests  are  capitalised  as  oil  and  gas  properties.  Costs  of  development  wells  and  related  support
equipment are capitalised. The cost of exploratory wells is initially capitalised as construction in progress pending determination of whether the
well has found proved reserves. Exploratory well costs are charged to expenses upon the determination that the well has not found proved
reserves. However, in the absence of a determination of the discovery of proved reserves, exploratory well costs are not carried as an asset for
more than one year following completion of drilling. If, after one year has passed, a determination of the discovery of proved reserves cannot be
made, the exploratory well costs are impaired and charged to expense. All other exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs,
are charged to profit or loss in the year as incurred.
The Group estimates future dismantlement costs for oil and gas properties with reference to engineering estimates after taking into consideration
the anticipated method of dismantlement required in accordance with the industry practices. These estimated future dismantlement costs are
discounted at credit-adjusted risk-free rate and are capitalised as oil and gas properties, which are subsequently amortised as part of the costs of
the oil and gas properties.
Capitalised costs relating to proved properties are amortised on a unit-of-production method.
(8)Intangible assets
 Intangible assets, where the estimated useful life is finite, are stated in the balance sheet at cost less accumulated amortisation and provision for
impairment  losses  (see  Note  3(12)).  For  an  intangible  asset  with  finite  useful  life,  its  cost  less  estimated  residual  value  and  accumulated
impairment losses is amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives, unless the intangible assets are classified as held for sale
(see Note 3(10)).
An intangible asset is regarded as having an indefinite useful life and is not amortised when there is no foreseeable limit to the year over which
the asset is expected to generate economic benefits for the Group.
Useful lives and amortisation methods are reviewed at least each year end.
(9)Goodwill
 The initial cost of goodwill represents the excess of cost of acquisition over the acquirer’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable net assets of
the acquiree under the business combination involving entities not under common control.
Goodwill is not amortised and is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses (see Note 3(12)). On disposal of an asset group or a set of
asset groups, any attributable amount of purchased goodwill is written off and included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.
(10)Held for sale and discontinued operation
 Non-current assets or disposal group that meet the following conditions will be classified as held for sale. (i) for the non-current assets or the
disposal group, they can only be sold immediately in current condition, according to the usual terms of selling the assets or disposal group; (ii)
the Group has made the resolution and obtain the appropriate approval on disposal of the non-current assets or the disposal group; (iii) the
Group has signed an irrevocable transfer agreement with the transferee; (iv) the transfer will be completed within one year.
Non-current assets, except for financial assets and deferred tax assets that satisfy there cognition criteria for assets held for sale are stated at to
the lower of carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell. Any excess of the original carrying amount over the fair value less costs to sell
is recognised as asset impairment loss.
The assets and liabilities in the non-current asset or disposal groups which have been classified as assets held for sale are classified as current
assets and current liabilities.
A  discontinued  operation  is  a  component  of  the  Group  that  either  has  been  disposed  of,  or  is  classified  as  held  for  sale,  can  be  clearly
distinguished operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest of the Group and (i) represents a separate major line of business or
geographical area of operations, (ii) is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of
operations, or (iii) is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.

(11) Financial Instruments
 Financial  instruments  of  the  Group  include  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  bond  investments,  equity  securities  other  than  long-term  equity
investments, receivables, derivative financial instruments, payables, loans, bonds payable, and share capital, etc.
(a)Classification, recognition and measurement of financial instruments
 The Group recognises a financial asset or a financial liability on its balance sheet when the Group enters into and becomes a party to the
underlining contract of the financial instrument.
The Group classifies financial assets and liabilities into different categories at initial recognition based on the purpose of acquiring assets and
assuming  liabilities:  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss,  loans  and  receivables,  held-to-maturity
investments, available-for-sale financial assets and other financial liabilities.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value. For financial asset or financial liability of which the change in its fair
value is recognised in profit or loss, the relevant transaction cost is recognised in profit or loss. The transaction costs for other financial assets or
financial liabilities are included in the initially recognised amount. Subsequent to initial recognition financial assets and liabilities are measured
as follows:
—Financial asset or financial liability at fair value through profit or loss (including financial asset or financial liability held for trading)
A financial asset or financial liability is classified as at fair value through profit or loss if it is acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of
selling  or  repurchasing  in  the  near  term  or  if  it  is  a  derivative,  unless  the  derivative  is  a  designated  and  effective  hedging  instrument,  or  a
financial guarantee contract, or a derivative that is linked to and must be settled by delivery of an unquoted equity instrument (without a quoted
price from an active market) whose fair value cannot be reliably measured. These financial instruments are initially measured at fair value with
subsequently changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. Subsequent to initial recognition, financial assets and financial liabilities at fair
value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, and changes therein are recognised in profit or loss.
—Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable recoverable amount and with no quoted price in active
market. After the initial recognition, receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
—Held-to-maturity investment
Held-to-maturity investment includes non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable recoverable amount and fixed maturity that the
Group has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. Subsequent to initial recognition, held-to-maturity investments are measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.
—Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets include non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available for sales and other financial assets
which do not fall into any of the above categories.
Available-for-sale financial assets whose fair value cannot be measured reliably are measured at cost subsequent to initial recognition. Other
available-for-sale financial assets are stated at fair values subsequent to initial recognition. The gains or losses arising from changes in the fair
value  are  directly  recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income,  except  for  the  impairment  losses  and  exchange  differences  from  monetary
financial  assets  denominated  in  foreign  currencies,  which  are  recognised  in  profit  or  loss.  The  cumulative  gains  and  losses  previously
recognised in equity are transferred to profit or loss when the available-for-sale financial assets are derecognised. Dividend income from these
equity  instruments  is  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  when  the  investee  declares  the  dividends.  Interest  on  available-for-sale  financial  assets
calculated using the effective interest rate method is recognised in profit or loss (see Note 3(17) (c)).
—Other financial liabilities
Financial liabilities other than the financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are classified as other financial liabilities.
Other  financial  liabilities  include  the  liabilities  arising  from  financial  guarantee  contracts.  Financial  guarantees  are  contracts  that  require  the
issuer (i.e. the guarantor) to make specified payments to reimburse the beneficiary of the guarantee (the holder) for a loss the holder incurs
because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Where the Group issues a
financial  guarantee,  subsequent  to  initial  recognition,  the  guarantee  is  measured  at  the  higher  of  the  amount  initially  recognised  less
accumulated amortisation and the amount of a provision determined in accordance with the principles of contingencies (see Note 3(16)).
Except for the other financial liabilities described above, subsequent to initial recognition, other financial liabilities are measured at amortised
cost using the effective interest method.

3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
(11) Financial Instruments (Continued)
(b) Disclosure of financial assets and financial liabilities
 In the balance sheet, financial assets and liabilities are not offset unless all the following conditions are met:
—the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off financial assets against financial liabilities; and
—the Group intends to settle the financial assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
(c) Determination of fair value
 If there is an active market for a financial asset or financial liability, the quoted price in the active market is used to establish the fair value of the
financial asset or financial liability.
If no active market exists for a financial instrument, a valuation technique is used to establish the fair value. Valuation techniques include using
arm’s  length  market  transactions  between  knowledge,  and  willing  parties;  reference  to  the  current  fair  value  of  other  instrument  that  is
substantially the same; discounted cash flows and option pricing model. The Group calibrates the valuation technique and tests it for validity
periodically.
(d) Hedge accounting
 Hedge accounting is a method which recognises the offsetting effects on profit or loss of changes in the fair values of the hedging instrument and
the hedged item in the same accounting period.
Hedged items are the items that expose the Group to risks of changes in fair value or future cash flows and that are designated as being hedged.
The Group’s hedged items include fixed-rate borrowings that expose the Group to risk of changes in fair values, floating rate borrowings that
expose the Group to risk of variability in cash flows, and a forecast transaction that is settled with a fixed amount of foreign currency and expose
the Group to foreign currency risk, and a forecast transaction that is settled with an undetermined future market price and exposes the Group to
risk of variability in cash flows, etc.
A hedging instrument is a designated derivative whose changes in fair value or cash flows are expected to offset changes in the fair value or
cash flows of the hedged item.
The  hedge  is  assessed  by  the  Group  for  effectiveness  on  an  ongoing  basis  and  determined  to  have  been  highly  effective  throughout  the
accounting periods for which the hedging relationship was designated. The Group uses a ratio analysis to assess the subsequent effectiveness
of a cash flow hedge, and uses a regression analysis to assess the subsequent effectiveness of a fair value hedge.
—Cash flow hedges
A cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows. The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is
determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in shareholders’ equity as a separate component. That effective portion is adjusted to
the lesser of the following (in absolute amounts):
—the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument from inception of the hedge;
—the cumulative change in present value of the expected future cash flows on the hedged item from inception of the hedge.
The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an ineffective hedge is recognised in profit or loss.
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset, the associated gain or loss is removed from
shareholders’ equity, included in the initial cost of the non-financial asset, and recognised in profit or loss in the same year during which the
financial asset affects profit or loss. However, if the Group expects that all or a portion of a net loss recognised directly in shareholders’ equity will
not be recovered in future accounting periods, it reclassifies the amount that is not expected to be recovered into profit or loss.
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, the associated gain or loss is
removed from equity and recognised in profit or loss in the same period during which the financial asset or financial liability affects profit or loss.
However,  if  the  Group  expects  that  all  or  a  portion  of  a  net  loss  recognised  directly  in  shareholders’  equity  will  not  be  recovered  in  future
accounting periods, it reclassifies the amount that is not expected to be recovered into profit or loss.
For  cash  flow  hedges,  other  than  those  covered  by  the  preceding  two  policy  statements,  the  associated  gain  or  loss  is  removed  from
shareholders’ equity and recognised in profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects profit or
loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the Group
will discontinue the hedge accounting treatments prospectively. In this case, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that remains recognised
directly in shareholders’ equity from the period when the hedge was effective shall not be reclassified into profit or loss and is recognised in
accordance with the above policy when the forecast transaction occurs. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss
on  the  hedging  instrument  that  remains  recognised  directly  in  shareholders’  equity  from  the  period  when  the  hedge  was  effective  shall  be
reclassified into profit or loss immediately.

—Fair value hedges
A fair value hedge is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment, or
an identified portion of such an asset, liability or unrecognised firm commitment.
The gain or loss from re-measuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised in profit or loss. The gain or loss on the hedged item
attributable to the hedged risk adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged item and is recognised in profit or loss.
When  a  hedging  instrument  expires  or  is  sold,  terminated  or  exercised,  or  no  longer  meets  the  criteria  for  hedge  accounting,  the  Group
discontinues  prospectively  the  hedge  accounting  treatments.  If  the  hedged  item  is  a  financial  instrument  measured  at  amortised  cost,  any
adjustment  to  the  carrying  amount  of  the  hedged  item  is  amortised  to  profit  or  loss  from  the  adjustment  date  to  the  maturity  date  using  the
recalculated effective interest rate at the adjustment date. The Group had no fair value hedges during this period.
—Hedge of net investment in foreign operation
A hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is a hedge of the exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with a net investment in a
foreign operation. The portion of the gain or loss on a hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in
equity as a separate component until the disposal of the foreign operation, at which time the cumulative gain or loss recognised directly in equity
is recognised in profit or loss. The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss. The Group had no hedge of a net investment in a
foreign operation during this period.
(e) Convertible bonds
—Convertible bonds that contain an equity component
Convertible bonds that can be converted to equity share capital at the option of the holder, where the number of shares that would be issued on
conversion  and  the  value  of  the  consideration  that  would  be  received  at  that  time  do  not  vary,  are  accounted  for  as  compound  financial
instruments which contain both a liability component and an equity component.
At  initial  recognition,  the  liability  component  of  the  convertible  bonds  is  measured  as  the  present  value  of  the  future  interest  and  principal
payments, discounted at the market rate of interest applicable at the time of initial recognition to similar liabilities that do not have a conversion
option.  Any  excess  of  proceeds  over  the  amount  initially  recognised  as  the  liability  component  is  recognised  as  the  equity  component.
Transaction  costs  that  relate  to  the  issue  of  the  convertible  bonds  are  allocated  to  the  liability  and  equity  components  in  proportion  to  the
allocation of proceeds.
Subsequent  to  initial  recognition,  the  liability  component  of  a  convertible  corporate  bond  is  measured  at  amortised  cost  using  the  effective
interest method, unless it is designated at fair value through profit or loss. The equity component of a convertible corporate bond is not  re-
measured subsequent to initial recognition.
If the convertible corporate bond is converted, the liability component, together with the equity component, is transferred to share capital and
capital reserve (share premium). If the convertible corporate bond is redeemed, the consideration paid for the redemption, together with the
transaction costs that relate to the redemption, are allocated to the liability and equity components. The difference between the allocated and
carrying amounts is charged to profit or loss if it relates to the liability component or is directly recognised in equity if it relates to the equity
component.
—Other convertible bonds
Convertible bonds issued with a cash settlement option and other embedded derivative features are split into liability and derivative components.
At initial recognition, the derivative component of the convertible bonds is measured at fair value. Any excess of proceeds over the amount
initially  recognised  as  the  derivative  component  is  recognised  as  the  liability  component.  Transaction  costs  that  relate  to  the  issue  of  the
convertible  bonds  are  allocated  to  the  liability  and  derivative  components  in  proportion  to  the  allocation  of  proceeds.  The  portion  of  the
transaction costs relating to the liability component is recognised initially as part of the liability. The portion relating to the derivative component
is recognised immediately as an expense in profit or loss.
The derivative component is subsequently remeasured at each balance sheet date and any gains or losses arising from change in the fair value
are  recognised  in  profit  or  loss.  The  liability  component  is  subsequently  carried  at  amortised  cost  using  the  effective  interest  method  until
extinguished  on  conversion  or  redemption.  Both  the  liability  and  the  related  derivative  components  are  presented  together  for  financial
statements reporting purposes.
If the convertible bonds are converted, the carrying amounts of the derivative and liability components are transferred to share capital and share
premium as consideration for the shares issued. If the convertible bonds are redeemed, any difference between the amount paid and the carrying
amount of both components is recognised in profit or loss.

(f) Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities
 The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual right to receive cash flows from the financial asset expires, or where the Group
transfers substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, or where the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all
risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset but the Group gives up the control of a financial asset.
On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the following amounts is recognised in profit or loss:
—the carrying amounts; and
—the sum of the consideration received and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised directly in equity.
Where the obligations for financial liabilities are completely or partially discharged, the entire or parts of financial liabilities are derecognised.
(12)Impairment of financial assets and non-financial long-term assets
Impairment of financial assets
(a)
 The carrying amount of financial assets (except those financial assets stated at fair value with changes in the fair values charged to profit or loss)
are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is objective evidence of impairment. If any such evidence exists, impairment
loss is provided.
Objective evidences of impairment include but not limited to:
(i)significant financial difficulty of the debtor;
(ii)a breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments;
(iii)it becoming probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation;
(iv)due to the significant financial difficulty of the debtor, financial assets is unable to be traded in active market;
(v)significant changes in the technological, market, economic or legal environment that have an adverse effect on the debtor; and
(vi)a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an investment in an equity instrument below its cost.
— Receivables and held-to-maturity investments
Receivables are assessed for impairment on the combination of an individual basis and the aging analysis.
Held-to-maturity investments are assessed for impairment on an individual basis.
Where impairment is assessed on an individual basis, an impairment loss in respect of a receivable or held-to-maturity investment is calculated
as the excess of its carrying amount over the present value of the estimated future cash flows (exclusive of future credit losses that have not been
incurred) discounted at the original effective interest rate. All impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.
Impairment  loss  on  receivables  and  held-to-maturity  investments  is  reversed  in  profit  or  loss  if  evidence  suggests  that  the  financial  assets’
carrying amounts have increased and the reason for the increase is objectively as a result of an event occurred after the recognition of the
impairment loss. The reversed carrying amount shall not exceed the amortised cost if the financial assets had no impairment recognised.
—
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are assessed for impairment on an individual basis. Objective evidence of impairment for equity instruments
classified  as  available-for-sale  includes  information  about  significant  but  not  temporary  decline  in  the  fair  value  of  the  equity  investment
instrument below its cost. The Group assesses equity instruments classified as available-for-sale separately at the end of each reporting period,
it  will  be  considered  as  impaired  if  the  fair  value  of  the  equity  instrument  at  reporting  date  is  less  than  its  initial  investment  cost  over  50%
(including 50%) or the duration of the fair value below its initial investment cost is more than one (including one) year, if the fair value of the
equity instrument at reporting date is less than its initial investment cost over 20% (including 20%) but below 50%, other related factors such as
price volatility will be taken into consideration to assess if it is impaired.
When available-for-sale financial assets measured at fair value are impaired, despite not being derecognised, the cumulative losses resulted
from the decrease in fair value which had previously been recognised directly in shareholders’ equity, are reversed and charged to profit or loss.
When available-for-sale financial assets measured at cost are impaired, the differences between the book value and the discounted present
value with the market return of similar financial assets are charged to profit or loss.
Impairment loss of available-for-sale debt instrument is reversed, if the reason for the subsequent increase in fair value is objectively as a result
of an event occurred after the recognition of the impairment loss. Impairment loss for available-for-sale equity instrument is not reversed through
profit or loss. Impairment loss for available-for-sale financial assets measured by the cost cannot be reversed in the following period.

Impairment of financial assets and non-financial long-term assets (Continued)
 
(b)
Impairment of other non-financial long-term assets
Internal  and  external  sources  of  information  are  reviewed  at  each  balance  sheet  date  for  indications  that  the  following  assets,
including fixed assets, oil and gas properties, construction in progress, goodwill, intangible assets and investments in subsidiaries,
jointly controlled entities and associates may be impaired.
 
Assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be
recoverable.  The  recoverable  amounts  of  goodwill  and  intangible  assets  with  uncertain  useful  lives  are  estimated  annually  no
matter there are any indications of impairment. Goodwill is tested for impairment together with related asset units or groups of asset
units.
 
An asset unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows largely independent of the cash inflows from
other assets or groups of assets. An asset unit comprises related assets that generate associated cash inflows. In identifying an
asset  unit,  the  Group  primarily  considers  whether  the  asset  unit  is  able  to  generate  cash  inflows  independently  as  well  as  the
management style of production and operational activities, and the decision for the use or disposal of asset.
 
The  recoverable  amount  is  the  greater  of  the  fair  value  less  costs  to  sell  and  the  present  value  of  expected  future  cash  flows
generated by the asset (or asset unit, set of asset units).
 
Fair value less costs to sell of an asset is based on its selling price in an arm’s length transaction less any direct costs attributable to
the disposal. Present value of expected future cash flows is the estimation of future cash flows to be generated from the use of and
upon disposal of the asset, discounted at an appropriate pre-tax discount rate over the asset’s remaining useful life.
 
If the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount.
The  amount  by  which  the  carrying  amount  is  reduced  is  recognised  as  an  impairment  loss  in  profit  or  loss.  A  provision  for
impairment loss of the asset is recognised accordingly. Impairment losses related to an asset unit or a set of asset units first reduce
the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the asset unit or set of asset units, and then reduce the carrying amount of the other
assets in the asset unit or set of asset units on a pro rata basis. However, the carrying amount of an impaired asset will not be
reduced below the highest of its individual fair value less costs to sell (if determinable), the present value of expected future cash
flows (if determinable) and zero.
 
Impairment losses for assets are not reversed.
Long-term deferred expenses
Long-term deferred expenses are amortised on a straight-line basis over their beneficial periods.
 
Employee benefits
Employee benefits are all forms of considerations and compensation given in exchange for services rendered by employees, including
short term compensation, post-employment benefits, termination benefits and other long term employee benefits.
 
(a) Short term compensation
Short term compensation includes salaries, bonuses, allowances and subsidies, employee benefits, medical insurance premiums,
work-related injury insurance premium, maternity insurance premium, contributions to housing fund, unions and education fund and
short-term absence with payment etc. When an employee has rendered service to the Group during an accounting period, the Group
shall recognise the short term compensation actually incurred as a liability and charged to the cost of an asset or to profit or loss in
the same period, and non-monetary benefits are valued with the fair value.
The Group classifies post-employment benefits into either Defined Contribution Plan (DC plan) or Defined Benefit Plan (DB plan).
DC plan means the Group only contributes a fixed amount to an independent fund and no longer bears other payment obligation;
DB plan is post-employment benefits other than DB. In this reporting period, the post-employment benefits of the Group primarily
comprise basic pension insurance and unemployment insurance and both of them are DC plans.
(b) Post-employment benefits
(c)
Basic pension insurance
 
Employees of the Group participate in the social insurance system established and managed by local labor and social security
department.  The  Group  makes  basic  pension  insurance  to  the  local  social  insurance  agencies  every  month,  at  the  applicable
benchmarks and rates stipulated by the government for the benefits of its employees. After the employees retire, the local labor and
social security department has obligations to pay them the basic pension. When an employee has rendered service to the Group
during an accounting period, the Group shall recognise the accrued amount according to the above social security provisions as a
liability and charged to the cost of an asset or to profit or loss in the same period.
 
Termination benefits
When  the  Group  terminates  the  employment  relationship  with  employees  before  the  employment  contracts  expire,  or  provides
compensation as an offer to encourage employees to accept voluntary redundancy, a provision for the termination benefits provided
is recognised in profit or loss under the conditions of both the Group has a formal plan for the termination of employment or has
made an offer to employees for voluntary redundancy, which will be implemented shortly; and the Group is not allowed to withdraw
from termination plan or redundancy offer unilaterally.

3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
(15)
Income tax
Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that they relate to business combinations and items
recognised directly in equity (including other comprehensive income).
 
Current tax is the expected tax payable calculated at the applicable tax rate on taxable income for the year, plus any adjustment to tax
payable in respect of previous years.
 
At the balance sheet date, current tax assets and liabilities are offset if the Group has a legally enforceable right to set them off and also
intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised based on deductible temporary differences and taxable temporary differences
respectively. Temporary difference is the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases including
unused tax losses and unused tax credits able to be utilised in subsequent years. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it
is probable that future taxable income will be available to offset the deductible temporary differences.
 
Temporary differences arise in a transaction, which is not a business combination, and at the time of transaction, does not affect
accounting profit or taxable profit (or unused tax losses), will not result in deferred tax. Temporary differences arising from the initial
recognition of goodwill will not result in deferred tax.
 
At the balance sheet date, the amounts of deferred tax recognised is measured based on the expected manner of recovery or settlement
of the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities, using tax rates that are expected to be applied in the period when the asset is
recovered or the liability is settled in accordance with tax laws.
 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date. If it is unlikely to obtain sufficient taxable income to
offset against the benefit of deferred tax asset, the carrying amount of the deferred tax assets is written down. Any such write-down should
be subsequently reversed where it becomes probable that sufficient taxable income will be available.
 
At the balance sheet date, deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if all the following conditions are met:
 
— the taxable entity has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and current tax liabilities; and
 
— they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on either:
 
      — the same taxable entity; or
 
      — different taxable entities which either to intend to settle the current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets
and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected
to be settled or recovered.
(16) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a contingent event, it is probable that an outflow of
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligations and a reliable estimate can be made. Where the effect of time value of money
is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows.
 
Provisions for future dismantlement costs are initially recognised based on the present value of the future costs expected to be incurred in
respect of the Group’s expected dismantlement and abandonment costs at the end of related oil and gas exploration and development
activities. Any subsequent change in the present value of the estimated costs, other than the change due to passage of time which is
regarded as interest costs, is reflected as an adjustment to the provision of oil and gas properties.
(17) Revenue recognition
Revenue is the gross inflow of economic benefits arising in the course of the Group’s normal activities when the inflows result in increase
in shareholder’s equity, other than increase relating to contributions from shareholders. Revenue is recognised in profit or loss when it is
probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group, the revenue and costs can be measured reliably and the following respective
conditions are met.
 
(a)  Revenues from sales of goods
Revenue from the sales of goods is recognised when all of the general conditions stated above and following conditions are satisfied:
 
—  the significant risks and rewards of ownership and title have been transferred to buyers; and
 
—  the Group does not retain the management rights, which is normally associated with owner, on goods sold and has no control over the
goods sold.
 
Revenue from the sales of goods is measured at fair value of the considerations received or receivable under the sales contract or
agreement.

(17) Revenue recognition (Continued)
(b)  Revenues from rendering services
The Group determines the revenue from the rendering of services according to the fair value of the received or to-be received price of the
party that receives the services as stipulated in the contract or agreement.
 
At the balance sheet date, when the outcome of a transaction involving the rendering of services can be estimated reliably, revenue from
rendering of services is recognised in the income statement by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction based on the
proportion of services performed to date to the total services to be performed.
 
When the outcome of rendering the services cannot be estimated reliably, revenues are recognised only to the extent that the costs
incurred are expected to be recoverable. If the costs of rendering of services are not expected to be recoverable, the costs are recognised
in profit or loss when incurred, and revenues are not recognised.
 
(c)  Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis with reference to the principal outstanding and the applicable effective interest
rate.
Government grants are the gratuitous monetary assets or non-monetary assets that the Group receives from the government, excluding
capital injection by the government as an investor. Special funds such as investment grants allocated by the government, if clearly defined
in official documents as part of “capital reserve” are dealt with as capital contributions, and not regarded as government grants.
 
Government grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the grants will be received and the Group is able to comply
with the conditions attaching to them. Government grants in the form of monetary assets are recorded based on the amount received or
receivable, whereas non-monetary assets are measured at fair value.
 
Government grants received in relation to assets are recorded as deferred income, and recognised evenly in profit or loss over the assets’
useful lives. Government grants received in relation to revenue are recorded as deferred income, and recognised as income in future
periods as compensation when the associated future expenses or losses arise; or directly recognised as income in the current period as
compensation for past expenses or losses.
Borrowing costs incurred on borrowings for the acquisition, construction or production of qualified assets are capitalised into the cost of
the related assets.
 
Except for the above, other borrowing costs are recognised as financial expenses in the income statement when incurred.
(19) Borrowing costs
(18) Government grants
(20) Repairs and maintenance expenses
   
   
  (21) Environmental expenditures
Repairs and maintenance (including overhauling expenses) expenses are recognised in profit or loss when incurred.

Dividends and distributions of profits proposed in the profit appropriation plan which will be authorised and declared after the balance
sheet date, are not recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date and are separately disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
If a party has the power to control, jointly control or exercise significant influence over another party, or vice versa, or where two or more
parties are subject to common control, joint control from another party, they are considered to be related parties. Related parties may be
individuals or enterprises. Where enterprises are subject to state control but are otherwise unrelated, they are not related parties. Related
parties of the Group and the Company include, but not limited to:
 
(a)  the holding company of the Company;
 
(b)  the subsidiaries of the Company;
 
(c)  the parties that are subject to common control with the Company;

(l)  an entity which is under control, joint control of principle individual investor, key management personnel or close family members of
such individuals.
(26) Segment reporting
Reportable segments are identified based on operating segments which are determined based on the structure of the Group’s internal
organisation, management requirements and internal reporting system. An operating segment is a component of the Group that meets the
following respective conditions:
 
—  engage in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses;
 
—  whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Group’s management to make decisions about resource to be allocated to the
segment and assess its performance; and
 
—  for which financial information regarding financial position, results of operations and cash flows are available.
 
Inter-segment revenues are measured on the basis of actual transaction price for such transactions for segment reporting, and segment
accounting policies are consistent with those for the consolidated financial statements.
In 2014, the MOF promulgated ASBE No. 39 through 41 regarding Fair Value Measurement, Joint Arrangement and Disclosure of

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of purchase over the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities. The recoverable amounts of the
above  cash  generating  units  are  determined  based  on  value  in  use  calculations.  These  calculations  use  cash  flow  projections  based  on
financial budgets approved by management covering a one-year period and pre-tax discount rates primarily ranging from 10.5% to 11.2% (2014:
10.0% to 10.9%). Cash flows beyond the one-year period are maintained constant. Based on the estimated recoverable amount, no impairment
loss was recognised.
Key assumptions used for cash flow forecasts for these entities are the gross margin and sales volume. Management determined the budgeted
gross margin based on the gross margin achieved in the period immediately before the budget period and management’s expectation on the
future trend of the prices of crude oil and petrochemical products. The sales volume was based on the production capacity and/or the sales
volume in the period immediately before the budget period.

At 30 June 2015, certain subsidiaries of the Company did not recognise deferred tax of deductible loss carried forward of RMB 18,171 million
(2014: RMB 17,085 million), of which RMB 1,740 million (2014: RMB 3,557 million) was incurred for the period ended 30 June 2015, because it
was not probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. These deductible losses carried forward of RMB 200 million, RMB 2,814 million,
RMB 3,787 million, RMB 2,634 million, RMB 6,996 million and RMB 1,740 million will expire in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and after,
respectively.
Periodically, management performed assessment on the probability that future taxable profit will be available over the period which the deferred
tax assets can be realised or utilised. In assessing the probability, both positive and negative evidence was considered, including whether it is
probable that the operations will have sufficient future taxable profits over the periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible or utilised and
whether the tax losses result from identifiable causes which are unlikely to recur. During the six-month period ended 30 June 2015, write-down of
deferred tax assets amounted to RMB 28 million (2014: RMB 30 million).
18OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS
Other non-current assets mainly represent prepayments for construction projects and purchases of equipment.

These corporate bonds are guaranteed by Sinopec Group Company and carried at amortised cost.
(i)
 
 
On 1 March 2011, the Company issued convertible bonds due 2017 with an aggregate principal amount of RMB 23 billion in the PRC
(ii)
(the “2011 Convertible Bonds”). The 2011 Convertible Bonds are issued at par value of RMB 100 and bear a fixed interest rate of 0.5%
per annum for the first year, 0.7% for the second year, 1.0% for the third year, 1.3% for the fourth year, 1.8% for the fifth year and 2.0%
for the sixth year, payable annually. The holders can convert the 2011 Convertible Bonds into shares of the Company from 24 August
2011 onwards at an initial conversion price of RMB 9.73 per share, subject to adjustment for, amongst other things, cash dividends,
subdivision or consolidation of shares, bonus issues, issue of new shares, rights issues, capital distribution, change of control and
other events which have an effect on the issued share capital of the Company (the “Conversion Option”). Unless previously redeemed,
converted or purchased and cancelled, the 2011 Convertible Bonds will be redeemed within 5 trading days after maturity at 107% of
the principal amount, including interest for the sixth year. The initial carrying amounts of the liability component and the derivative
component, representing the Conversion Option of the 2011 Convertible Bonds, were RMB 19,279 million and RMB 3,610 million,
respectively.
 
During the term of the 2011 Convertible Bonds, the conversion price may be subject to downward adjustment that if the closing prices
of the Company’s A Shares in any fifteen trading days out of any thirty consecutive trading days are lower than 80% of the prevailing
conversion  price,  the  board  of  directors  may  propose  downward  adjustment  to  the  conversion  price  subject  to  the  shareholders’
approval. The adjusted conversion price shall be not less than (a) the average trading price of the Company’s A Shares for the twenty
trading days prior to the shareholders’ approval, (b) the average trading price of the Company’s A Shares on the day immediately
before the shareholders’ approval, (c) the net asset value per share based on the latest audited financial statements prepared under
ASBE, and (d) the nominal value per share.
 
During the term of the 2011 Convertible Bonds, if the closing price of the A Shares of the Company is not lower than 130% of the
conversion price in at least fifteen trading days out of any thirty consecutive trading days, the Company has the right to redeem all or
part of the 2011 Convertible Bonds based on the nominal value plus the accrued interest (“the terms of conditional redemption”).
 
As at 26 January 2015, the terms of conditional redemption of 2011 Convertible Bonds of the Company have been triggered for the first
time.  As  at  27  January  2015,  at  the  22nd  meeting  of  the  fifth  session  of  the  board  of  the  Company  (the  “Board”),  the  Board  has
reviewed and approved the proposal for the redemption of 2011 Convertible Bonds, and decided to exercise the right of redemption
and to redeem all of the outstanding 2011 Convertible Bonds registered on 11 February 2015.
 
From  1  January  2015  to  11  February  2015,  the  2011  Convertible  Bonds  with  a  total  nominal  value  of  RMB  13,647  million  were
converted into 2,790,814,006 A shares of the Company with a conversion price of RMB 4.89 per share. As of 11 February 2015, the
total share capital of the Company has been increased to 121,071,209,646 shares. The unconverted convertible bonds amounted to
RMB 52,776,000 (527,760 convertible bonds). As at 17 February 2015, the Company has redeemed and fully paid the unconverted
portion at RMB 101.261 per convertible bond (including the accrued interest and interest tax accrued thereon).
 
The changes in the fair value of the derivative component from 31 December 2014 to 30 June 2015 resulted in an realized loss of
RMB  259  million  (2014:  unrealized  loss  of  RMB  2,221  million),  which  has  been  recorded  in  the  “finance  costs”  section  of  the
consolidated income statement for the six-month period ended 30 June 2015.
As at 30 June 2015, the 2011 Convertible Bonds have been fully converted or redeemed (2014: liability component RMB 13,433
million, derivative component RMB 3,288 million).

Capital management
Management  optimises  the  structure  of  the  Group’s  capital,  which  comprises  of  equity  and  debts.  In  order  to  maintain  or  adjust  the  capital
structure of the Group, management may cause the Group to issue new shares, adjust the capital expenditure plan, sell assets to reduce debt, or
adjust the proportion of short-term and long-term loans. Management monitors capital on the basis of the debt-to-capital ratio, which is calculated
by  dividing  long-term  loans  (excluding  current  portion),  including  long-term  debts  and  loans  from  Sinopec  Group  Company  and  fellow
subsidiaries, by the total of equity attributable to owners of the Company and long-term loans (excluding current portion), and liability-to-asset
ratio, which is calculated by dividing total liabilities by total assets. Management’s strategy is to make appropriate adjustments according to the
Group’s operating and investment needs and the changes of market conditions, and to maintain the debt-to-capital ratio and the liability-to-asset
ratio of the Group at a range considered reasonable. As at 30 June 2015, the debt-to-capital ratio and the liability-to-asset ratio of the Group were
15.1% (2014: 20.2%) and 46.4% (2014: 55.4%), respectively.
The schedule of the contractual maturities of loans and commitments are disclosed in Notes 28 and 53, respectively.
There were no changes in the management’s approach to capital management of the Group during the period. Neither the Company nor any of
its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

51PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The Group’s financial condition and results of operations are sensitive to accounting methods, assumptions and estimates that underlie the
preparation  of  the  financial  statements.  The  Group  bases  the  assumptions  and  estimates  on  historical  experience  and  on  various  other
assumptions that it believes to be reasonable and which form the basis for making judgements about matters that are not readily apparent from
other sources. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates as facts, circumstances
and conditions change.
The selection of critical accounting policies, the judgements and other uncertainties affecting application of those policies and the sensitivity of
reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions are factors to be considered when reviewing the financial statements. The significant
accounting policies are set forth in Note 3. The Group believes the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgements
and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements.
(a)Oil and gas properties and reserves
 The accounting for the exploration and production segment’s oil and gas activities is subject to accounting rules that are unique to the oil and
gas industry. The Group has used the successful efforts method to account for oil and gas business activities. The successful efforts method
reflects the volatility that is inherent in exploring for mineral resources in that costs of unsuccessful exploratory efforts are charged to expense.
These costs primarily include dry hole costs, seismic costs and other exploratory costs.
Engineering estimates of the Group’s oil and gas reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the
subjective judgements involved in developing such information. There are authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that have to
be met before estimated oil and gas reserves can be designated as “proved”. Proved and proved developed reserves estimates are updated at
least annually and take into account recent production and technical information about each field. In addition, as prices and cost levels change
from year to year, the estimate of proved and proved developed reserves also changes. This change is considered a change in estimate for
accounting purposes and is reflected on a prospective basis in related depreciation rates.
Future dismantlement costs for oil and gas properties are estimated with reference to engineering estimates after taking into consideration the
anticipated  method  of  dismantlement  required  in  accordance  with  industry  practices  in  the  similar  geographic  area,  including  estimation  of
economic  life  of  oil  and  gas  properties,  technology  and  price  level.  The  present  values  of  these  estimated  future  dismantlement  costs  are
capitalised as oil and gas properties with equivalent amounts recognised as provisions for dismantlement costs.
Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, these estimates are used in determining depreciation expense, impairment
expense  and  future  dismantlement  costs.  Depreciation  rates  are  determined  based  on  estimated  proved  developed  reserve  quantities  (the
denominator) and capitalised costs of producing properties (the numerator). Producing properties’ capitalised costs are amortised based on the
unit-of-production method.
(b)Impairment for assets
 If circumstances indicate that the net book value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable, the asset may be considered “impaired”, and an
impairment  loss  may  be  recognised  in  accordance  with  “ASBE  8  –  Impairment  of  Assets”.  The  carrying  amounts  of  long-lived  assets  are
reviewed periodically in order to assess whether the recoverable amounts have declined below the carrying amounts. These assets are tested
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their recorded carrying amounts may not be recoverable. When such
a decline has occurred, the carrying amount is reduced to recoverable amount. For goodwill, the recoverable amount is estimated annually. The
recoverable amount is the greater of the net selling price and the value in use. It is difficult to precisely estimate selling price because quoted
market prices for the Group’s assets or cash-generating units are not readily available. In determining the value in use, expected cash flows
generated by the asset or the cash-generating unit are discounted to their present value, which requires significant judgement relating to sales
volume,  selling  price  and  amount  of  operating  costs.  The  Group  uses  all  readily  available  information  in  determining  an  amount  that  is  a
reasonable approximation of recoverable amount, including estimates based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections of
sales volume, selling price and amount of operating costs.
(c)Depreciation
 Fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, after taking into account the estimated residual
value. Management reviews the estimated useful lives of the assets at least annually in order to determine the amount of depreciation expense
to be recorded during any reporting period. The useful lives are based on the Group’s historical experience with similar assets and taking into
account  anticipated  technological  changes.  The  depreciation  expense  for  future  periods  is  adjusted  if  there  are  significant  changes  from
previous estimates.
(d)Allowances for doubtful accounts
 Management estimates impairment losses for bad and doubtful debts resulting from the inability of the Group’s customers to make the required
payments. Management bases the estimates on the ageing of the accounts receivable balance, customer credit-worthiness, and historical write-
off experience. If the financial condition of the customers were to deteriorate, actual write-offs would be higher than estimated.
(e)Allowance for diminution in value of inventories
 If the costs of inventories become higher than their net realisable values, an allowance for diminution in value of inventories is recognised. Net
realisable  value  represents  the  estimated  selling  price  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business,  less  the  estimated  costs  of  completion  and  the
estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Management bases the estimates on all available information, including the current market prices of
the finished goods and raw materials, and historical operating costs. If the actual selling prices were to be lower or the costs of completion were
to be higher than estimated, the actual allowance for diminution in value of inventories would be higher than estimated.

Note: 
 
 
(i)
Pursuant to the resolution of the Company’s Meeting of Board of Directors held on 19 February 2014, the Company’s business under its
marketing and distribution segment of the Group was injected to Marketing Company, a subsidiary of the Group on 1 April 2014.
 
On  12  September  2014,  Marketing  Company  entered  into  the  “Capital  Injection  Agreement  relating  to  Marketing  Company”  with  a
number of domestic and foreign investors, pursuant to which the investors shall subscribe for equity interest in Marketing Company in
cash upon the relevant approvals for this capital injection being obtained, an aggregate capital contribution of RMB 105.044 billion was
made to the Marketing Company by 25 investors, representing 29.58% equity interest in the Marketing Company on 6 March 2015.
 
The  Group  consolidated  the  financial  statements  of  the  entity  because  it  is  exposed  to,  or  has  rights  to,  variable  returns  from  its
involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect its return through its power over the entity.
(iii) Pursuant to the Share Repurchase Agreement and Disposal Agreement entered into between the Company and Yizheng Chemical
Fibre Co., Ltd. on 12 September 2014, Yizheng Chemical Fibre Co., Ltd. repurchased and cancelled the 40.25% of its equity interests
held  by  the  Company  in  exchange  for  the  transfer  of  its  outgoing  business  to  the  Company,  pursuant  to  which  this  business  was
injected into Yizheng Chemical Fibre.
 
Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement between Sinopec Group Company and Yizheng Chemical Fibre Co., Ltd. on the same date,
Yizheng Chemical Fibre Co., Ltd. issued shares to Sinopec Group Company for the acquisition of a 100% equity interest of Sinopec
Oilfield Service Corporation (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sinopec Group Company). The above transactions were inter-conditional
and were completed in December 2014.
 
The Group accounted for the transaction pursuant to the Share Repurchase Agreement as a transaction with minority interests since the
control of business had not been lost, which resulted in an increase in capital reserve of the Group’s consolidated financial statement
amounting to RMB 3,227 million and decrease of minority interests amounting to RMB 2,867 million.
(iv) On 1 August 2014, GWEC acquired an additional 45% of the equity interest in shares in Ningxia Nenghua (GWEC previously held a
50%  equity  interest)  and  obtained  control  of  Ningxia  Nenghua  (a  coal  chemical  producer)  which  the  Group  accounted  for  as  a
subsidiary of GWEC thereafter. The cash consideration was RMB 2,593 million. The fair value of the 50% equity interest held before the
business  combination  was  RMB  2,881  million.  The  fair  value  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  Ningxia  Nenghua  primarily  include
construction in progress (RMB 14,094 million), fixed assets (RMB 3,293 million) and borrowings (RMB 11,862 million) and no goodwill
was resulted from the business combination.

54CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
(a)The Company has been advised by its PRC lawyers that, except for liabilities constituting or arising out of or relating to the business assumed
by the Company in the Reorganisation, no other liabilities were assumed by the Company, and the Company is not jointly and severally liable
for other debts and obligations incurred by Sinopec Group Company prior to the Reorganisation.
(b)At 30 June 2015 and 31 December 2014, guarantees by the Group in respect of facilities granted to the parties below are as follows:
Jointly controlled entities
Others

The Group monitors the conditions that are subject to the guarantees to identify whether it is probable that a loss has occurred, and recognises
any such losses under guarantees when those losses are estimable. At 30 June 2015 and 31 December 2014, it is not probable that the Group
will be required to make payments under the guarantees. Thus no liabilities have been accrued for a loss related to the Group’s obligation under
these guarantee arrangements.
90
54CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (Continued)
Environmental contingencies
 Under existing legislation, management believes that there are no probable liabilities that will have a material adverse effect on the financial
position  or  operating  results  of  the  Group.  The  PRC  government,  however,  has  moved,  and  may  move  further  towards  more  rigorous
enforcement of applicable laws, and towards the adoption of more stringent environmental standards. Environmental liabilities are subject to
considerable uncertainties which affect the Group’s ability to estimate the ultimate cost of remediation efforts. These uncertainties include (i) the
exact nature and extent of the contamination at various sites including, but not limited to refineries, oil fields, service stations, terminals and land
development areas, whether operating, closed or sold, (ii) the extent of required cleanup efforts, (iii) varying costs of alternative remediation
strategies, (iv) changes in environmental remediation requirements, and (v) the identification of new remediation sites. The amount of such future
cost  is  indeterminable  due  to  such  factors  as  the  unknown  magnitude  of  possible  contamination  and  the  unknown  timing  and  extent  of  the
corrective actions that may be required. Accordingly, the outcome of environmental liabilities under proposed or future environmental legislation
cannot  reasonably  be  estimated  at  present,  and  could  be  material.  The  Group  recognized  normal  routine  pollutant  discharge  fees  of
approximately  RMB  2,461million  for  the  six-month  period  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  ended  30  June  2015  (2014:  RMB  1,979
million).
Legal contingencies
The  Group  is  a  defendant  in  certain  lawsuits  as  well  as  the  named  party  in  other  proceedings  arising  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business.
Management has assessed the likelihood of an unfavourable outcome of such contingencies, lawsuits or other proceedings and believes that
any resulting liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position, operating results or cash flows of the Group.
55SEGMENT REPORTING
Segment information is presented in respect of the Group’s operating segments. The format is based on the Group’s management and internal
reporting structure.
In a manner consistent with the way in which information is reported internally to the Group’s chief operating decision maker for the purposes of
resource allocation and performance assessment, the Group has identified the following five reportable segments. No operating segments have
been aggregated to form the following reportable segments.
(i) Exploration and production — which explores and develops oil fields, produces crude oil and natural gas and sells such products to the
refining segment of the Group and external customers.
(ii) Refining — which processes and purifies crude oil, which is sourced from the exploration and production segment of the Group and
external suppliers, and manufactures and sells petroleum products to the chemicals and marketing and distribution segments of the Group
and external customers.
(iii)Marketing  and  distribution  —  which  owns  and  operates  oil  depots  and  service  stations  in  the  PRC,  and  distributes  and  sells  refined
petroleum products (mainly gasoline and diesel) in the PRC through wholesale and retail sales networks.
(iv)Chemicals — which manufactures and sells petrochemical products, derivative petrochemical products and other chemical products to
external customers.
(v) Corporate and others — which largely comprise the trading activities of the import and export companies of the Group and research and
development undertaken by other subsidiaries.
The  segments  were  determined  primarily  because  the  Group  manages  its  exploration  and  production,  refining,  marketing  and  distribution,
chemicals, and corporate and others businesses separately. The reportable segments are each managed separately because they manufacture
and/or distribute distinct products with different production processes and due to their distinct operating and gross margin characteristics.
91
55SEGMENT REPORTING (Continued)
(1)Information of reportable segmental revenues, profits or losses, assets and liabilities
 The  Group’s  chief  operating  decision  maker  evaluates  the  performance  and  allocates  resources  to  its  operating  segments  on  an  operating
income basis, without considering the effects of finance costs or investment income. Inter-segment transfer pricing is based on the market price
or cost plus an appropriate margin, as specified by the Group’s policy.
Assets and liabilities dedicated to a particular segment’s operations are included in that segment’s total assets and liabilities. Segment assets
include all tangible and intangible assets, except for cash at bank and on hand, long-term equity investments, deferred tax assets and other
unallocated assets. Segment liabilities exclude short-term loans, short-term debentures payable, non-current liabilities due within one year, long-
term loans, debentures payable, deferred tax liabilities, other non-current liabilities and other unallocated liabilities.
Reportable information on the Group’s operating segments is as follows:
Income from principal operations
Exploration and production
External sales
Inter-segment sales

Overview
Financial assets of the Group include cash at bank, equity investments, accounts receivable, bills receivable, available-for-sale financial assets,
derivative financial instruments and other receivables. Financial liabilities of the Group include short-term and long-term loans, accounts payable,
bills payable, debentures payable, employee benefits payable, derivative financial instruments and other payables.
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its uses of financial instruments:
‧credit risk;
‧liquidity risk;
‧market risk.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework, and developing
and monitoring the Group’s risk management policies.
The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, and set appropriate risk limits and
controls to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market
conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined
and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. Internal audit department undertakes both
regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Group’s audit committee.
Credit risk
 Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations,
and arises principally from the Group’s deposits placed with financial institutions and receivables from customers. To limit exposure to credit risk
relating to deposits, the Group primarily places cash deposits only with large financial institution in the PRC with acceptable credit ratings. The
majority of the Group’s accounts receivable relates to sales of petroleum and chemical products to related parties and third parties operating in
the petroleum and chemical industries. The Group performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and generally does
not require collateral on accounts receivable. The Group maintains an impairment loss for doubtful accounts and actual losses have been within
management’s expectations.
The carrying amounts of cash at bank, trade accounts and bills receivables, derivative financial instruments and other receivables, represent the
Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
Liquidity risk
 Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group encounters short fall of capital when meeting its obligation of financial liabilities. The Group’s approach to
managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal
and stressed capital conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. The Group prepares monthly
cash flow budget to ensure that they will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its financial obligation as they fall due. The Group arranges and
negotiates financing with financial institutions and maintains a certain level of standby credit facilities to reduce the liquidity risk.
At 30 June 2015, the Group has standby credit facilities with several PRC financial institutions which provide the Group to borrow up to RMB
299,319 million (2014: RMB 302,570 million) on an unsecured basis, at a weighted average interest rate of 2.46% (2014: 3.51%). At 30 June
2015, the Group’s outstanding borrowings under these facilities were RMB 68,585 million (2014: RMB 78,983 million) and were included in
loans.
The following table sets out the remaining contractual maturities at the balance sheet date of the Group’s financial liabilities, which are based on
contractual  undiscounted  cash  flows  (including  interest  payments  computed  using  contractual  rates  or,  if  floating,  based  on  prevailing  rates
current at the balance sheet date) and the earliest date the Group would be required to repay:

Management believes that the Group’s current cash on hand, expected cash flows from operations and available standby credit facilities from
financial institutions will be sufficient to meet the Group’s working capital requirements and repay its short-term debts and obligations when they
become due.
Market risk
 Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The objective of market risk management
is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
(a)Currency risk
 Currency risk arises on financial instruments that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency in which they are measured.
The Group’s currency risk exposure primarily relates to short-term and long-term debts denominated in US Dollars, Japanese Yen and Hong
Kong Dollars, and the Group enters into foreign exchange contracts to manage currency risk exposure.
Included in short-term and long-term debts denominated are the following amounts denominated in a currency other than the functional currency
of the entity to which they relate:

A 5 percent strengthening of Renminbi against the following currencies at 30 June 2015 and 31 December 2014 would have increased net profit
for the period/year of the Group by the amounts shown below. This analysis has been determined assuming that the change in foreign exchange
rates had occurred at the balance sheet date and had been applied to the foreign currency balances to which the Group has significant exposure
as stated above, and that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2014.

(b)Interest rate risk
 The Group’s interest rate risk exposure arises primarily from its short-term and long-term loans. Loans carrying interest at variable rates and at
fixed rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk and fair value interest rate risk respectively. The interest rates and terms of repayment
of short-term and long-term loans of the Group are disclosed in Note 20 and Note 28, respectively.
At 30 June 2015 it is estimated that a general increase/decrease of 100 basis points in variable interest rates, with all other variables held
constant,  would  decrease/increase  the  Group’s  net  profit  for  the  period  by  approximately  RMB  519  million  (2014:  RMB  1,040  million).  This
sensitivity analysis has been determined assuming that the change in interest rates had occurred at the balance sheet date and the change was
applied to the Group’s loans outstanding at that date with exposure to cash flow interest rate risk. The analysis is performed on the same basis
for 2014.
(c)Commodity price risk
 The Group engages in oil and gas operations and is exposed to commodity price risk related to price volatility of crude oil, refined oil products
and chemical products. The fluctuations in prices of crude oil, refined oil products and chemical products could have significant impact on the
Group. The Group uses derivative financial instruments, including commodity futures and swaps, to manage a portion of such risk.
At 30 June 2015, the Group had certain commodity contracts of crude oil, refined oil products and chemical products designated as qualified
cash  flow  hedges  and  economic  hedges.  At  30  June  2015,  the  net  fair  value  of  such  derivative  hedging  financial  instruments  is  derivative
financial assets of RMB 1,878 million (2014: RMB 12,622 million) recognised in other receivables and derivative financial liabilities of RMB
9,897 million (2014: RMB 18,990 million) recognised in other payables.
At 30 June 2015, it is estimated that a general increase/decrease of USD 10 per barrel in basic price of derivative financial instruments, with all
other variables held constant, would impact the fair value of derivative financial instruments, which would decrease/increase the Group’s profit
for  the  period  by  approximately  RMB  727  million  (2014:  decrease/increase  RMB  190  million),  and  decrease/increase  the  Group’s  other
comprehensive income by approximately RMB 17,984 million (2014: increase/decrease RMB 737 million). This sensitivity analysis has been
determined assuming that the change in prices had occurred at the balance sheet date and the change was applied to the Group’s derivative
financial instruments at that date with exposure to commodity price risk. The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2014.
Fair values
(i)Financial instruments carried at fair value
 The following table presents the carrying value of financial instruments measured at fair value at the balance sheet date across the three levels
of the fair value hierarchy. With the fair value of each financial instrument categorised in its entirely based on the lowest level of input that is
significant to that fair value measurement. The levels are defined as follows:
‧
‧
‧
Level 1 (highest level): fair values measured using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical financial instruments.
Level 2: fair values measured using quoted prices in active markets for similar financial instruments, or using valuation techniques in
which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly based on observable market data.
Level 3 (lowest level): fair values measured using valuation techniques in which any significant input is not based on observable market
data.

(ii)Fair values of financial instruments carried at other than fair value
 The  fair  values  of  the  Group’s  financial  instruments  carried  at  other  than  fair  value  (other  than  long-term  debts  and  unquoted  security
investments)  approximate  their  carrying  amounts  due  to  the  short-term  maturity  of  these  instruments.  The  fair  values  of  long-term  debts  are
estimated  by  discounting  future  cash  flows  using  current  market  interest  rates  offered  to  the  Group  for  debt  with  substantially  the  same
characteristics and maturities ranging 0.77% to 5.40% (2014: 0.33% to 6.15%). The following table presents the carrying amount and fair value of
the Group’s long-term debts other than loans from Sinopec Group Company and fellow subsidiaries at 30 June 2015 and 31 December 2014:

The  Group  has  not  developed  an  internal  valuation  model  necessary  to  make  the  estimate  of  the  fair  value  of  loans  from  Sinopec  Group
Company  and  fellow  subsidiaries  as  it  is  not  considered  practicable  to  estimate  their  fair  value  because  the  cost  of  obtaining  discount  and
borrowing rates for comparable borrowings would be excessive based on the Reorganisation of the Group, its existing capital structure and the
terms of the borrowings.
Other unquoted equity investments are individually and in the aggregate not material to the Group’s financial position or results of operations.
There are no listed market prices for such interests in the PRC and, accordingly, a reasonable estimate of fair value could not be made without
incurring excessive costs. The Group intends to hold these unquoted equity investments for long term purpose.
Except for the above items, the financial assets and liabilities of the Group are carried at amounts not materially different from their fair values at
30 June 2015 and 31 December 2014.

REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL AUDITOR
Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Shareholders of China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation
(incorporated in People’s Republic of China with limited liability)
We have audited the consolidated interim financial statements of China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries
(together, the “Group”) set out on pages 101 to 147, which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 30 June 2015, and the consolidated
income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated
statement of cash flows for the six-month period then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of consolidated interim financial statements that give a true and fair view in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the
preparation of consolidated interim financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITY
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated interim financial statements based on our audit and to report our opinion solely
to you, as a body, and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility towards or accept liability to any other person for the contents of this
report.
We conducted our audit in accordance with Hong Kong Standards on Auditing issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the consolidated interim financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain  audit  evidence  about  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  consolidated  interim  financial
statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the
consolidated interim financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control
relevant to the entity’s preparation of consolidated interim financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An
audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the
directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated interim financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
OPINION
In our opinion, the consolidated interim financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group as at 30 June 2015,
and  of  the  Group’s  financial  performance  and  cash  flows  for  the  six-month  period  then  ended  in  accordance  with  International  Financial
Reporting Standards.

(a)According to the Articles of Association of the Company, the Company is required to transfer 10% of its net profit determined in accordance
with  the  accounting  policies  complying  with  Accounting  Standards  for  Business  Enterprises  (“ASBE”),  adopted  by  the  Group  to  statutory
surplus reserve. In the event that the reserve balance reaches 50% of the registered capital, no transfer is required. The transfer to this reserve
must be made before distribution of a dividend to shareholders. Statutory surplus reserve can be used to make good previous years’ losses, if
any, and may be converted into share capital by issuing of new shares to shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings or by
increasing the par value of the shares currently held by them, provided that the balance after such issue is not less than 25% of the registered
capital.
The reserve balance has reached 50% of the registered capital, therefore during the six-month period ended 30 June 2015, the Company
decided not to transferred statutory surplus reserve (2014: nil).
(b)The usage of the discretionary surplus reserve is similar to that of statutory surplus reserve.
 
(c) As at 30 June 2015, the amount of retained earnings available for distribution was RMB 159,832 million (2014: RMB 168,834 million), being
the amount determined in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). According to the Articles of Association of the
Company,  the  amount  of  retained  earnings  available  for  distribution  to  owners  of  the  Company  is  the  lower  of  the  amount  determined  in
accordance  with  the  accounting  policies  complying  with  ASBE  and  the  amount  determined  in  accordance  with  the  accounting  policies
complying with IFRS.
(d)The capital reserve represents (i) the difference between the total amount of the par value of shares issued and the amount of the net assets
transferred from Sinopec Group Company in connection with the Reorganisation; and (ii) the difference between the considerations paid over
the amount of the net assets of entities and related operations acquired from Sinopec Group Company and non-controlling interests.
(e)The application of the share premium account is governed by Sections 167 and 168 of the PRC Company Law.
 
(f) According to relevant PRC regulations, the Group is required to transfer an amount to other reserves for the safety production fund based on
the turnover of certain refining and chemicals products or based on the production volume of crude oil and natural gas. During the six-month
period ended 30 June 2015, the Group transferred RMB 914 million (2014: RMB 1,064 million) from retained earnings to other reserves for the
safety production fund.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the six-month period ended 30 June 2015
1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES, ORGANISATION AND BASIS OF PREPARATION
Principal activities
China  Petroleum  &  Chemical  Corporation  (the  “Company’’)  is  an  energy  and  chemical  company  that,  through  its  subsidiaries  (hereinafter
collectively referred to as the “Group’’), engages in oil and gas and chemical operations in the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC’’). Oil and
gas operations consist of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; transporting crude oil and natural gas by pipelines;
refining crude oil into finished petroleum products; and marketing crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products. Chemical operations
include the manufacture and marketing of a wide range of chemicals for industrial uses.
Organisation
The  Company  was  established  in  the  PRC  on  25  February  2000  as  a  joint  stock  limited  company  as  part  of  the  reorganisation  (the
“Reorganisation”) of China Petrochemical Corporation (‘‘Sinopec Group Company’’), the ultimate holding company of the Group and a ministry-
level enterprise under the direct supervision of the State Council of the PRC. Prior to the incorporation of the Company, the oil and gas and
chemical operations of the Group were carried on by oil administration bureaux, petrochemical and refining production enterprises and sales and
marketing companies of Sinopec Group Company.
As part of the Reorganisation, certain of Sinopec Group Company’s core oil and gas and chemical operations and businesses together with the
related assets and liabilities were transferred to the Company. On 25 February 2000, in consideration for Sinopec Group Company transferring
such oil and gas and chemical operations and businesses and the related assets and liabilities to the Company, the Company issued 68.8
billion domestic state-owned ordinary shares with a par value of RMB 1.00 each to Sinopec Group Company. The shares issued to Sinopec
Group Company on 25 February 2000 represented the entire registered and issued share capital of the Company on that date. The oil and gas
and chemical operations and businesses transferred to the Company were related to (i) the exploration, development and production of crude oil
and natural gas, (ii) the refining, transportation, storage and marketing of crude oil and petroleum products, and (iii) the production and sales of
chemicals.
Basis of preparation
The  accompanying  interim  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  IFRSs  as  issued  by  the  International  Accounting
Standards Board (“IASB”). IFRS includes International Accounting Standards (“IAS”) and related interpretations (“IFRIC”). These interim financial
statements also comply with the applicable disclosure provisions of the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on the Stock Exchange of
Hong Kong Limited. A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Group are set out in Note 2.
(a)New and amended standards and interpretations adopted by the Group
The IASB has not issued any new and amended standards and interpretations that are first effective for the current accounting period of the
Group. The Group has not adopted any new standard or interpretation that is not yet effective for the current accounting period.
(b)New and amended standards and interpretations not yet adopted by the Group
The following relevant IFRSs, amendments to existing IFRSs and interpretation of IFRS have been published and are mandatory for accounting
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016 or later periods and have not been early adopted by the Group. Management is in the process of
making an assessment of what the impact of these amendments, new standards and new interpretations is expected to be in the period of initial
application  and  has  so  far  concluded  that  the  adoption  of  these  amendments,  new  standards  and  new  interpretations  is  unlikely  to  have  a
significant impact on the Group’s results of operations and financial position.
IFRS  9,  ‘Financial  instruments’,  addresses  the  classification,  measurement  and  recognition  of  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities.  The
complete version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014. It replaces the whole of IAS 39. IFRS 9 introduces a new model for the recognition of
impairment losses – the expected credit losses (ECL) model, which constitutes a change from the incurred loss model in IAS 39. IFRS 9 applies
to  all  hedging  relationships,  with  the  exception  of  portfolio  fair  value  hedges  of  interest  rate  risk.  The  new  guidance  better  aligns  hedge
accounting with the risk management activities of an entity and provides relief from the more “rule-based” approach of IAS 39.
Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 on sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture. The amendments
address an inconsistency between IFRS 10 and IAS 28 in the sale and contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint
venture. A full gain or loss is recognised when a transaction involves a business. A partial gain or loss is recognised when a transaction involves
assets that do not constitute a business, even if those assets are in a subsidiary.
Amendment to IFRS 11 on accounting for acquisitions of interests in joint operations. The amendment requires an investor to apply the principles
of business combination accounting when it acquires an interest in a joint operation that constitutes a ‘business’ (as defined in IFRS 3, Business
combinations). Specifically, an investor will need to: (1) measure identifiable assets and liabilities at fair value; (2) expense acquisition-related
costs; (3) recognise deferred tax; and (4) recognise the residual as goodwill. All other principles of business combination accounting apply unless
they conflict with IFRS 11. The amendment is applicable to both the acquisition of the initial interest and a further interest in a joint operation. The
previously held interest is not remeasured when the acquisition of an additional interest in the same joint operation with joint control maintained.
IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’. IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining when to recognise revenue
and  how  much  revenue  to  recognise  through  a  5-step  approach.  IFRS  15  provides  specific  guidance  on  capitalisation  of  contract  cost  and
licence arrangements. It also includes a cohesive set of disclosure requirements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and
cash flows arising from the entity’s contracts with customers. The core principle is that a company should recognise revenue to depict the transfer
of  promised  goods  or  services  to  the  customer  in  an  amount  that  reflects  the  consideration  to  which  the  company  expects  to  be  entitled  in
exchange for those goods or services. IFRS 15 replaces the previous revenue standards: IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’
and the related Interpretations on revenue recognition: IFRIC 13 ‘Customer Loyalty Programmes’, IFRIC 15 ‘Agreements for the Construction of
Real Estate’, IFRIC 18 ‘Transfers of Assets from Customers’ and SIC-31 ‘Revenue—Barter Transactions Involving Advertising Services’.

Basis of preparation (Continued)
(c)New Hong Kong Companies Ordinance
The requirements of Part 9 “Accounts and Audit” of the new Hong Kong Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622) come into operation in accordance
with  section  358  of  that  Ordinance.  So  far  it  has  concluded  that  the  impact  is  unlikely  to  be  significant  and  only  the  presentation  and  the
disclosure  of  information  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  will  be  affected.  The  consolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  in
accordance with the applicable requirements of the predecessor Companies Ordinance (Cap. 32) for this financial period and the comparative
period.
The  accompanying  interim  financial  statements  are  prepared  on  the  historical  cost  basis  except  for  the  remeasurement  of  available-for-sale
securities (Note 2(k)), securities held for trading (Note 2(k)), derivative financial instruments (Note 2(l) and (m)) and derivative component of the
convertible bonds (Note 2(q)) to their fair values.
The  preparation  of  the  interim  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  IFRS  requires  management  to  make  judgements,  estimates  and
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at  the  date  of  the  interim  financial  statements  and  the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the  period.  The  estimates  and
associated  assumptions  are  based  on  historical  experience  and  various  other  factors  that  are  believed  to  be  reasonable  under  the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in
which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both
current and future periods.
Key assumptions and estimation made by management in the application of IFRS that have significant effect on the interim financial statements
and the major sources of estimation uncertainty are disclosed in Note 37.
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(a)Basis of consolidation
 The consolidated interim financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries, and interest in associates and joint ventures.
(i)Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests
 Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The interim financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated interim financial statements from the date that control effectively
commences until the date that control effectively ceases.
Non-controlling interests at the balance sheet date, being the portion of the net assets of subsidiaries attributable to equity interests that are not
owned by the Company, whether directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, are presented in the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated
statement of changes in equity within equity, separately from equity attributable to the owners of the Company. Non-controlling interests in the
results of the Group are presented on the face of the consolidated income statement and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income
as an allocation of the total profit or loss and total comprehensive income for the period between non-controlling interests and the owners of the
Company.
Changes  in  the  Group’s  interests  in  a  subsidiary  that  do  not  result  in  a  loss  of  control  are  accounted  for  as  equity  transactions,  whereby
adjustments are made to the amounts of controlling and non-controlling interests within consolidated equity to reflect the change in relative
interests, but no adjustments are made to goodwill and no gain or loss is recognised.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, it is accounted for as a disposal of the entire interest in that subsidiary, with a resulting gain or loss
being recognised in profit or loss. Any interest retained in that former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is recognised at fair value and
this amount is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition of a financial asset (Note 2(k)) or, when appropriate, the cost on initial recognition
of an investment in an associate or joint venture (Note 2(a) (ii)).
The particulars of the Group’s principal subsidiaries are set out in Note 35.
109
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
(a)Basis of consolidation (Continued)
(ii) Associates and joint ventures
 An associate is an entity, not being a subsidiary, in which the Group exercises significant influence over its management. Significant influence is
the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The  investments  in  joint  arrangements  are  classified  as  either  joint  operations  or  joint  ventures  depending  on  the  contractual  rights  and
obligations each investor has rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties
that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for in the consolidated interim financial statements using the equity method from the
date that significant influence or joint control commences until the date that significant influence or joint control ceases. Under the equity method,
the investment is initially recorded at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post acquisition change in the Group’s share of the investee’s net
assets and any impairment loss relating to the investment (Note 2(j) and (n)).
The  Group’s  share  of  the  post-acquisition,  post-tax  results  of  the  investees  and  any  impairment  losses  for  the  period  are  recognised  in  the
consolidated income statement, whereas the Group’s share of the post-acquisition post-tax items of the investees’ other comprehensive income
is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
When the Group ceases to have significant influence over an associate or joint control over a joint venture, it is accounted for as a disposal of the
entire interest in that investee, with a resulting gain or loss being recognised in profit or loss. Any interest retained in that former investee at the
date when significant influence or joint control is lost is recognised at fair value and this amount is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition
of a financial asset (see Note 2(k)) or, when appropriate, the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate (Note 2(a) (ii)).
In the Group’s balance sheet, investments in associates and joint ventures are stated at cost less impairment losses (Note 2(n)).
(iii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
 Inter-company balances and transactions and any unrealised gains arising from inter-company transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the entity.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
(b)Translation of foreign currencies
 The  presentation  currency  of  the  Group  is  Renminbi.  Foreign  currency  transactions  during  the  period  are  translated  into  Renminbi  at  the
applicable rates of exchange quoted by the People’s Bank of China (“PBOC”) prevailing on the transaction dates. Foreign currency monetary
assets and liabilities are translated into Renminbi at the PBOC’s rates at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences, other than those capitalised as construction in progress, are recognised as income or expense in the “finance costs”
section of the consolidated income statement.
The results of foreign operations are translated into Renminbi at the applicable rates quoted by the PBOC prevailing on the transaction dates.
Balance  sheet  items,  including  goodwill  arising  on  consolidation  of  foreign  operations  are  translated  into  Renminbi  at  the  closing  foreign
exchange rates at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated
in equity in the other reserves.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of the exchange differences relating to that foreign operation is reclassified from equity
to the consolidated income statement when the profit or loss on disposal is recognised.
(c)Cash and cash equivalents
 Cash  equivalents  consist  of  time  deposits  with  financial  institutions  with  an  initial  term  of  less  than  three  months  when  purchased.  Cash
equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.
(d)Trade, bills and other receivables
 Trade, bills and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and thereafter stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method,
less impairment losses for bad and doubtful debts (Note 2(n)). Trade, bills and other receivables are derecognised if the Group’s contractual
rights to the cash flows from these financial assets expire or if the Group transfers these financial assets to another party without retaining control
or substantially all risks and rewards of the assets.
(e)Inventories
Inventories, other than spare parts and consumables, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes the cost of purchase
computed  using  the  weighted  average  method  and,  in  the  case  of  work  in  progress  and  finished  goods,  direct  labour  and  an  appropriate
proportion of production overheads. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated
costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Spare parts and consumables are stated at cost less any provision for obsolescence.
110
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
(f)Property, plant and equipment
 An item of property, plant and equipment is initially recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses (Note 2(n)). The cost
of an asset comprises its purchase price, any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to working condition and location for its intended
use. The Group recognises in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment the cost of replacing part of such an item when
that cost is incurred, when it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item
can be measured reliably. All other expenditure is recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement in the year in which it is
incurred.
Gains  or  losses  arising  from  the  retirement  or  disposal  of  an  item  of  property,  plant  and  equipment,  other  than  oil  and  gas  properties,  are
determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item and are recognised as income or expense
in the consolidated income statement on the date of retirement or disposal.
Depreciation  is  provided  to  write  off  the  cost  amount  of  items  of  property,  plant  and  equipment,  other  than  oil  and  gas  properties,  over  its
estimated useful life on a straight-line basis, after taking into account its estimated residual value, as follows:
Buildings
Equipment, machinery and others
12 to 50 years 
4 to 30 years
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, the cost of the item is allocated on a reasonable basis
between the parts and each part is depreciated separately. Both the useful life of an asset and its residual value, if any, are reassessed annually.
(g)Oil and gas properties
 The Group uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas producing activities. Under this method, costs of development
wells,  the  related  support  equipment  and  proved  mineral  interests  in  properties  are  capitalised.  The  cost  of  exploratory  wells  is  initially
capitalised as construction in progress pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves. The impairment of exploratory well
costs occurs upon the determination that the well has not found proved reserves. The exploratory well costs are usually not carried as an asset
for more than one year following completion of drilling, unless (i) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a
producing well if the required capital expenditure is made; (ii) drilling of the additional exploratory wells is under way or firmly planned for the
near future; or (iii) other activities are being undertaken to sufficiently progress the assessing of the reserves and the economic and operating
viability of the project. All other exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs, other dry hole costs and annual lease rentals, are
expensed  as  incurred.  Capitalised  costs  relating  to  proved  properties  are  amortised  at  the  field  level  on  a  unit-of-production  method.  The
amortisation  rates  are  determined  based  on  oil  and  gas  reserves  estimated  to  be  recoverable  from  existing  facilities  over  the  shorter  of  the
economic lives of crude oil and natural gas reservoirs and the terms of the relevant production licenses.
Management  estimates  future  dismantlement  costs  for  oil  and  gas  properties  with  reference  to  engineering  estimates  after  taking  into
consideration the anticipated method of dismantlement required in accordance with the industry practices and the future cash flows are adjusted
to reflect such risks specific to the liability, as appropriate. These estimated future dismantlement costs are discounted at pre-tax risk-free rate
and are capitalised as oil and gas properties, which are subsequently amortised as part of the costs of the oil and gas properties.
(h)Lease prepayments
 Lease prepayments represent land use rights paid to the relevant government authorities. Land use rights are carried at cost less accumulated
amount charged to expense and impairment losses (Note 2(n)). The cost of lease prepayments are charged to expense on a straight-line basis
over the respective periods of the rights.
(i)
Construction in progress
Construction in progress represents buildings, oil and gas properties, various plant and equipment under construction and pending installation,
and is stated at cost less impairment losses (Note 2(n)). Cost comprises direct costs of construction as well as interest charges, and foreign
exchange differences on related borrowed funds to the extent that they are regarded as an adjustment to interest charges, during the periods of
construction.
Construction in progress is transferred to property, plant and equipment when the asset is substantially ready for its intended use.
No depreciation is provided in respect of construction in progress.
(j)Goodwill
 Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures. Goodwill represents the difference between the
cost of acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
Prior to 1 January 2008, the acquisition of the non-controlling interests of a consolidated subsidiary was accounted using the acquisition method
whereby the difference between the cost of acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired (on a proportionate share) was
recognised as goodwill. From 1 January 2008, any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted (such as
through an acquisition of the non-controlling interests) and the cash or other considerations paid is recognised in equity.
Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill arising on a business combination is allocated to each cash-generating
unit, or groups of cash generating units, that is expected to benefit the synergies of the combination and is tested annually for impairment (Note
2(n)). In respect of associates or joint ventures, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the interest in the associate
or joint venture and the investment as a whole is tested for impairment whenever there is objective evidence of impairment (Note 2(n)).
111
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
(k)Available-for-sale financial assets
 Investment in available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with any change in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income and
accumulated  separately  in  equity  in  other  reserve.  When  these  investments  are  derecognised  or  impaired,  the  cumulative  gain  or  loss  is
reclassified from equity to the consolidated income statement. Investments in equity securities, other than investments in associates and joint
ventures, that do not have a quoted market price in an active market and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are recognised in the
balance sheet at cost less impairment losses (Note 2(n)).
Investments in securities held for trading are classified as current assets. Any attributable transaction costs are recognised in the consolidated
income statement as incurred. At each balance sheet date, the fair value is remeasured, with any resultant gain or loss being recognised in the
consolidated income statement.
(l)Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. At each balance sheet date the fair value is remeasured. The gain or loss on
remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement, except where the derivatives qualify for cash flow
hedge accounting or hedge the net investment in a foreign operation, in which case recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the
nature of the item being hedged (Note 2(m)).
(m)Hedging
(i)Cash flow hedges
 Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability or a highly
probable forecast transaction or the foreign currency risk of a committed future transaction, the effective portion of any gains or losses on re-
measurement of the derivative financial instrument to fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated separately in
equity in other reserves. The ineffective portion of any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset, the associated gain or loss is reclassified
from equity to be included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the non-financial asset.
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, the associated gain or loss is
reclassified from equity to the consolidated income statement in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed
affects the consolidated income statement (such as when interest income or expense is recognised).
For cash flow hedges, other than those covered by the preceding two policy statements, the associated gain or loss is reclassified from equity to
the consolidated income statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the consolidated income
statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged
forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity until the transaction occurs and it is
recognised in accordance with the above policy. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or
loss is reclassified from equity to the consolidated income statement immediately.
(ii) Hedge of net investments in foreign operations
 The portion of the gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value of an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is
determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated separately in equity in the other reserve
until  the  disposal  of  the  foreign  operation,  at  which  time  the  cumulative  gain  or  loss  is  reclassified  from  equity  to  the  consolidated  income
statement. The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement. In this period no hedge of net investment in
foreign operations was hold by the Group.
112
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
(n)Impairment of assets
(i)Trade accounts receivable, other receivables and investment in equity securities that do not have a quoted market price in an active market are
reviewed  at  each  balance  sheet  date  to  determine  whether  there  is  objective  evidence  of  impairment.  If  any  such  evidence  exists,  an
impairment loss is determined and recognised.
The impairment loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the estimated future cash flows, discounted at the
current market rate of return for a similar financial asset where the effect of discounting is material, and is recognised as an expense in the
consolidated income statement. Impairment losses for trade and other receivables are reversed through the consolidated income statement if in
a subsequent period the amount of the impairment losses decreases. Impairment losses for equity securities carried at cost are not reversed.
For  investments  in  associates  and  joint  ventures  accounted  under  the  equity  method  (Note  2(a)  (ii)),  the  impairment  loss  is  measured  by
comparing the recoverable amount of the investment as a whole with its carrying amount in accordance with the accounting policy set out in
Note 2(n) (ii). The impairment loss is reversed if there has been a favourable change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount
in accordance with the accounting policy set out in Note 2(n) (ii).
Impairment of other long-lived assets is accounted as follows:
(ii)
 The carrying amounts of other long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, construction in progress, lease prepayments and other
assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to identify indicators that the assets may be impaired. These assets are tested for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their recorded carrying amounts may not be recoverable. When such a decline has
occurred, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount. For goodwill, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet
date.
The recoverable amount is the greater of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. In determining the value in use, expected future
cash flows generated by the asset are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of
the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Where an asset does not generate cash inflows largely independent of those from
other assets, the recoverable amount is determined for the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows independently (i.e. a cash-
generating unit).
The amount of the reduction is recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement. Impairment losses recognised in respect of
cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit and then, to reduce
the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis, except that the carrying value of an asset will not be reduced below its
individual fair value less costs to sell, or value in use, if determinable.
Management assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any indication that an impairment loss recognised for a long-lived asset,
except in the case of goodwill, which in prior years may no longer exist. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a favourable change in
the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. A subsequent increase in the recoverable amount of an asset, when the circumstances
and events that led to the write-down or write-off cease to exist, is recognised as an income. The reversal is reduced by the amount that would
have been recognised as depreciation had the write-down or write-off not occurred. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
(o)Trade, bills and other payables
 Trade, bills and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and thereafter stated at amortised cost unless the effect of discounting would
be immaterial, in which case they are stated at cost.
(p)Interest-bearing borrowings
 Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-
bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the consolidated
income statement over the period of borrowings using the effective interest method.

2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
(q)Convertible bonds
(i)Convertible bonds that contain an equity component
 Convertible bonds that can be converted to equity share capital at the option of the holder, where the number of shares that would be issued on
conversion  and  the  value  of  the  consideration  that  would  be  received  at  that  time  do  not  vary,  are  accounted  for  as  compound  financial
instruments that contain both a liability component and an equity component.
At  initial  recognition,  the  liability  component  of  the  convertible  bonds  is  measured  as  the  present  value  of  the  future  interest  and  principal
payments, discounted at the market rate of interest applicable at the time of initial recognition to similar liabilities that do not have a conversion
option.  Any  excess  of  proceeds  over  the  amount  initially  recognised  as  the  liability  component  is  recognised  as  the  equity  component.
Transaction costs that relate to the issuance of the convertible bonds are allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to the
allocation of proceeds.
The  liability  component  is  subsequently  carried  at  amortised  cost.  The  interest  expense  on  the  liability  component  is  calculated  using  the
effective interest method. The equity component is recognised in the capital reserve until the bond is converted or redeemed.
If the bond is converted, the capital reserve, together with the carrying amount of the liability component at the time of conversion, is transferred to
share capital and share premium as consideration for the shares issued. If the bond is redeemed, the capital reserve is transferred to share
premium.
(ii) Other convertible bonds
 Convertible  bonds  issued  with  a  cash  settlement  option  and  other  embedded  derivative  features  are  accounted  for  as  compound  financial
instruments that contain a liability component and a derivative component.
At initial recognition, the derivative component of the convertible bonds is measured at fair value. Any excess of proceeds over the amount
initially recognised as the derivative component is recognised as the liability component. Transaction costs that relate to the issuance of the
convertible  bonds  are  allocated  to  the  liability  and  derivative  components  in  proportion  to  the  allocation  of  proceeds.  The  portion  of  the
transaction costs relating to the liability component is recognised initially as part of the liability. The portion relating to the derivative component
is recognised immediately as an expense in the consolidated income statement.
The derivative component is subsequently remeasured at each balance sheet date and any gains or losses arising from change in the fair value
are recognised in the consolidated income statement. The liability component is subsequently carried at amortised cost until extinguished on
conversion or redemption. The interest expense recognised in the consolidated income statement on the liability component is calculated using
the effective interest method. Both the liability and the related derivative components are presented together for financial statements reporting
purposes.
If the convertible bonds are converted, the carrying amounts of the derivative and liability components are transferred to share capital and share
premium as consideration for the shares issued. If the convertible bonds are redeemed, any difference between the amount paid and the carrying
amounts of both components is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
(r)Provisions and contingent liability
 A provision is recognised for liability of uncertain timing or amount when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation arising as a result of a
past event, when it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made.
When  it  is  not  probable  that  an  outflow  of  economic  benefits  will  be  required,  or  the  amount  cannot  be  estimated  reliably,  the  obligation  is
disclosed as a contingent liability, unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote. Possible obligations, whose existence will
only  be  confirmed  by  the  occurrence  or  non-occurrence  of  one  or  more  future  events  are  also  disclosed  as  contingent  liabilities  unless  the
probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote.
Provisions  for  future  dismantlement  costs  are  initially  recognised  based  on  the  present  value  of  the  future  costs  expected  to  be  incurred  in
respect of the Group’s expected dismantlement and abandonment costs at the end of related oil and gas exploration and development activities.
Any subsequent change in the present value of the estimated costs, other than the change due to passage of time which is regarded as interest
cost, is reflected as an adjustment to the provision and oil and gas properties.
(s)Revenue recognition
 Revenues associated with the sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum and chemical products and ancillary materials are recorded when the
customer accepts the goods and the significant risks and rewards of ownership and title have been transferred to the buyer. Revenue from the
rendering of services is recognised in the consolidated income statement upon performance of the services. No revenue is recognised if there
are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due, the possible return of goods, or when the amount of revenue and the
costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction cannot be measured reliably.
Interest income is recognised on a time apportioned basis that takes into account the effective yield on the asset.
A government grant that becomes receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred with no future related costs is recognised
as income in the period in which it becomes receivable.
114
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
(t)Borrowing costs
 Borrowing costs are expensed in the consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred, except to the extent that they are
capitalised as being attributable to the construction of an asset which necessarily takes a period of time to get ready for its intended use.
(u)Repairs and maintenance expenditure
 Repairs and maintenance expenditure is expensed as incurred.
(v)Environmental expenditures
 Environmental expenditures that relate to current ongoing operations or to conditions caused by past operations are expensed as incurred.
Liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments and/or cleanups are probable and the costs can be
reasonably estimated. As facts concerning environmental contingencies become known to the Group, the Group reassesses its position both
with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures.
(w)Research and development expense
 Research and development expenditures are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Research and development expense amounted
to RMB 1,934 million for the six-month period ended 30 June 2015 (2014: RMB 1,901 million).
(x)Operating leases
 Operating lease payments are charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the respective leases.
(y)Employee benefits
 The contributions payable under the Group’s retirement plans are recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement as incurred
and according to the contribution determined by the plans. Further information is set out in Note 33.
Termination benefits, such as employee reduction expenses, are recognised when, and only when, the Group demonstrably commits itself to
terminate  employment  or  to  provide  benefits  as  a  result  of  voluntary  redundancy  by  having  a  detailed  formal  plan  which  is  without  realistic
possibility of withdrawal.
(z)Income tax
 Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is calculated on taxable income by applying the applicable tax rates. Deferred tax is
provided using the balance sheet liability method on all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income will be available
against which the assets can be utilised. Deferred tax is calculated on the basis of the enacted tax rates or substantially enacted tax rates that
are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled. The effect on deferred tax of any changes in tax rates is
charged or credited to the consolidated income statement, except for the effect of a change in tax rate on the carrying amount of deferred tax
assets and liabilities which were previously charged or credited to other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
The tax value of losses expected to be available for utilisation against future taxable income is set off against the deferred tax liability within the
same legal tax unit and jurisdiction to the extent appropriate, and is not available for set off against the taxable profit of another legal tax unit. The
carrying amount of a deferred tax asset is reviewed at each balance sheet date and is reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the
related tax benefit will be realised.
(aa)Dividends
 Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are declared.
(bb)Segment reporting
 Operating segments, and the amounts of each segment item reported in the financial statements, are identified from the financial information
provided regularly to the Group’s chief operating decision maker for the purposes of allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of
the Group’s various lines of business.

13BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE
The calculation of basic earnings per share for the six-month period ended 30 June 2015 is based on the profit attributable to ordinary owners of
the  Company  of  RMB  25,394  million  (2014:  RMB  32,543  million)  and  the  weighted  average  number  of  shares  of  120,629,864,875  (2014:
116,725,537,824) during the period.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share for the six-month period ended 30 June 2015 is based on the profit attributable to ordinary owners

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of purchase over the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities. The recoverable amounts of the
above  cash  generating  units  are  determined  based  on  value  in  use  calculations.  These  calculations  use  cash  flow  projections  based  on
financial budgets approved by management covering a one-year period and pre-tax discount rates primarily ranging from 10.5% to 11.2% (2014:
10.0% to 10.9%). Cash flows beyond the one-year period are maintained constant. Based on the estimated recoverable amount, no impairment
loss was recognised.
Key assumptions used for cash flow forecasts for these entities are the gross margin and sales volume. Management determined the budgeted
gross margin based on the gross margin achieved in the period immediately before the budget period and management’s expectation on the
future trend of the prices of crude oil and petrochemical products. The sales volume was based on the production capacity and/or the sales
volume in the period immediately before the budget period.

Trade accounts and bills receivables (net of impairment losses for bad and doubtful debts) primarily represent receivables that are neither past
due nor impaired. These receivables relate to a wide range of customers for whom there is no recent history of default.

At 30 June 2015, certain subsidiaries of the Company did not recognise deferred tax of deductable loss carried forward of RMB 18,171 million
(2014: RMB 17,085 million), of which RMB 1,740 million (2014: RMB 3,557 million) was incurred for the period ended 30 June 2015, because it
was not probable that the future taxable profits will be realised. These deductable losses carried forward of RMB 200 million, RMB 2,814 million,
RMB 3,787 million, RMB 2,634 million, RMB 6,996 million and RMB 1,740 million will expire in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and after,
respectively.
Periodically, management performed assessment on the probability that future taxable profit will be available over the period which the deferred
tax assets can be realised or utilised. In assessing the probability, both positive and negative evidence was considered, including whether it is
probable that the operations will have sufficient future taxable profits over the periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible or utilised and
whether the tax losses result from identifiable causes which are unlikely to recur. During the six-month period ended 30 June 2015, write-down of
deferred tax assets amounted to RMB 28 million (2014: RMB 30 million).

26SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBTS AND LOANS FROM SINOPEC GROUP COMPANY AND FELLOW SUBSIDIARIES (Continued)
Note:
(i)These corporate bonds are guaranteed by Sinopec Group Company and carried at amortised cost.
(ii)On 1 March 2011, the Company issued convertible bonds due 2017 with an aggregate principal amount of RMB 23 billion in the PRC (the
“2011 Convertible Bonds”). The 2011 Convertible Bonds are issued at par value of RMB 100 and bear a fixed interest rate of 0.5% per annum
for the first year, 0.7% for the second year, 1.0% for the third year, 1.3% for the fourth year, 1.8% for the fifth year and 2.0% for the sixth year,
payable annually. The holders can convert the 2011 Convertible Bonds into shares of the Company from 24 August 2011 onwards at an initial
conversion  price  of  RMB  9.73  per  share,  subject  to  adjustment  for,  amongst  other  things,  cash  dividends,  subdivision  or  consolidation  of
shares, bonus issues, issue of new shares, rights issues, capital distribution, change of control and other events which have an effect on the
issued share capital of the Company (the “Conversion Option”). Unless previously redeemed, converted or purchased and cancelled, the
2011 Convertible Bonds will be redeemed within 5 trading days after maturity at 107% of the principal amount, including interest for the sixth
year. The initial carrying amounts of the liability component and the derivative component, representing the Conversion Option of the 2011
Convertible Bonds, were RMB 19,279 million and RMB 3,610 million, respectively.
During the term of the 2011 Convertible Bonds, the conversion price may be subject to downward adjustment that if the closing prices of the
Company’s A Shares in any fifteen trading days out of any thirty consecutive trading days are lower than 80% of the prevailing conversion price,
the board of directors may propose downward adjustment to the conversion price subject to the shareholders’ approval. The adjusted conversion
price  shall  be  not  less  than  (a)  the  average  trading  price  of  the  Company’s  A  Shares  for  the  twenty  trading  days  prior  to  the  shareholders’
approval, (b) the average trading price of the Company’s A Shares on the day immediately before the shareholders’ approval, (c) the net asset
value per share based on the latest audited financial statements prepared under ASBE, and (d) the nominal value per share.
During the term of the 2011 Convertible Bonds, if the closing price of the A Shares of the Company is not lower than 130% of the conversion
price in at least fifteen trading days out of any thirty consecutive trading days, the Company has the right to redeem all or part of the 2011
Convertible Bonds based on the nominal value plus the accrued interest (“the terms of conditional redemption”).
As at 26 January 2015, the terms of conditional redemption of 2011 Convertible Bonds of the Company have been triggered for the first time. As
at 27 January 2015, at the 22nd meeting of the fifth session of the board of the Company (the “Board”), the Board has reviewed and approved the
proposal for the redemption of 2011 Convertible Bonds, and decided to exercise the right of redemption and to redeem all of the outstanding
2011 Convertible Bonds registered on 11 February 2015.
From 1 January 2015 to 11 February 2015, the 2011 Convertible Bonds with a total nominal value of RMB 13,647 million were converted into
2,790,814,006 A shares of the Company with a conversion price of RMB 4.89 per share. As of 11 February 2015, the total share capital of the
Company  has  been  increased  to  121,071,209,646  shares.  The  unconverted  convertible  bonds  amounted  to  RMB  52.78  million  (527,760
convertible bonds). As at 17 February 2015, the Company has redeemed and fully paid the unconverted portion at RMB 101.261 per convertible
bond (including the accrued interest and interest tax accrued thereon).
The changes in the fair value of the derivative component from 31 December 2014 to 30 June 2015 resulted in an realised loss of RMB 259
million  (2014:  unrealised  loss  of  RMB  2,221  million),  which  has  been  recorded  in  the  “finance  costs”  section  of  the  consolidated  income
statement for the six-month period ended 30 June 2015.
As  at  30  June  2015,  the  2011  Convertible  Bonds  have  been  fully  converted  or  redeemed  (2014:  liability  component  RMB  13,433  million,
derivative component RMB 3,288 million).

Capital management
Management  optimises  the  structure  of  the  Group’s  capital,  which  comprises  of  equity  and  debts.  In  order  to  maintain  or  adjust  the  capital
structure of the Group, management may cause the Group to issue new shares, adjust the capital expenditure plan, sell assets to reduce debt, or
adjust the proportion of short-term and long-term loans. Management monitors capital on the basis of the debt-to-capital ratio, which is calculated
by  dividing  long-term  loans  (excluding  current  portion),  including  long-term  debts  and  loans  from  Sinopec  Group  Company  and  fellow
subsidiaries, by the total of equity attributable to owners of the Company and long-term loans (excluding current portion), and liability-to-asset
ratio, which is calculated by dividing total liabilities by total assets. Management’s strategy is to make appropriate adjustments according to the
Group’s operating and investment needs and the changes of market conditions, and to maintain the debt-to-capital ratio and the liability-to-asset
ratio of the Group at a range considered reasonable. As at 30 June 2015, the debt-to-capital ratio and the liability-to-asset ratio of the Group were
15.2% (2014: 20.3%) and 46.5% (2014: 55.5%), respectively.
The schedule of the contractual maturities of loans and commitments are disclosed in Notes 26 and 31, respectively.
There were no changes in the management’s approach to capital management of the Group during the period. Neither the Company nor any of
its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

Management monitors the conditions that are subject to the guarantees to identify whether it is probable that a loss has occurred, and recognises
any such losses under guarantees when those losses are estimable. At 30 June 2015 and 31 December 2014, it was not probable that the Group
will be required to make payments under the guarantees. Thus no liability has been accrued for the Group’s obligation under these guarantee
arrangements.
Environmental contingencies
Under existing legislation, management believes that there are no probable liabilities that will have a material adverse effect on the financial
position or operating results of the Group. The PRC government, however, has moved, and may move further towards more rigorous enforcement
of applicable laws, and towards the adoption of more stringent environmental standards. Environmental liabilities are subject to considerable
uncertainties  which  affect  management’s  ability  to  estimate  the  ultimate  cost  of  remediation  efforts.  These  uncertainties  include  (i)  the  exact
nature  and  extent  of  the  contamination  at  various  sites  including,  but  not  limited  to  refineries,  oil  fields,  service  stations,  terminals  and  land
development  areas,  whether  operating,  closed  or  sold,  (ii)  the  extent  of  required  cleanup  efforts,  (iii)  varying  costs  of  alternative  remediation
strategies, (iv) changes in environmental remediation requirements, and (v) the identification of new remediation sites. The amount of such future
cost  is  indeterminable  due  to  such  factors  as  the  unknown  magnitude  of  possible  contamination  and  the  unknown  timing  and  extent  of  the
corrective actions that may be required. Accordingly, the outcome of environmental liabilities under proposed or future environmental legislation
cannot  reasonably  be  estimated  at  present,  and  could  be  material.  The  Group  recognized  normal  routine  pollutant  discharge  fees  of
approximately  RMB  2,461million  for  the  six-month  period  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  ended  30  June  2015  (2014:  RMB  1,979
million).
Legal contingencies
The  Group  is  a  defendant  in  certain  lawsuits  as  well  as  the  named  party  in  other  proceedings  arising  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business.
Management has assessed the likelihood of an unfavourable outcome of such contingencies, lawsuits or other proceedings and believes that
any resulting liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position, operating results or cash flows of the Group.

‧
‧
‧
‧
‧
sales and purchases of goods and ancillary materials;

beyond the annual contributions described above. The Group’s contributions for the six-month period ended 30 June 2015 were RMB3,992
million (2014: RMB 3,910 million).
34SEGMENT REPORTING
Segment information is presented in respect of the Group’s business segments. The format is based on the Group’s management and internal
reporting structure.
In a manner consistent with the way in which information is reported internally to the Group’s chief operating decision maker for the purposes of
resource allocation and performance assessment, the Group has identified the following five reportable segments. No operating segments have
been aggregated to form the following reportable segments.
(i)Exploration and production, which explores and develops oil fields, produces crude oil and natural gas and sells such products to the refining
segment of the Group and external customers.
(ii)Refining, which processes and purifies crude oil, that is  sourced  from  the  exploration  and  production  segment  of  the  Group  and  external
suppliers,  and  manufactures  and  sells  petroleum  products  to  the  chemicals  and  marketing  and  distribution  segments  of  the  Group  and
external customers.
(iii)Marketing and distribution, which owns and operates oil depots and service stations in the PRC, and distributes and sells refined petroleum
products (mainly gasoline and diesel) in the PRC through wholesale and retail sales networks.
(iv)Chemicals, which manufactures and sells petrochemical products, derivative petrochemical products and other chemical products mainly to
external customers.
(v)Corporate  and  others,  which  largely  comprises  the  trading  activities  of  the  import  and  export  companies  of  the  Group  and  research  and
development undertaken by other subsidiaries.
The  segments  were  determined  primarily  because  the  Group  manages  its  exploration  and  production,  refining,  marketing  and  distribution,
chemicals, and corporate and others businesses separately. The reportable segments are each managed separately because they manufacture
and/or distribute distinct products with different production processes and due to their distinct operating and gross margin characteristics.
136
34SEGMENT REPORTING (Continued)
Information of reportable segmental revenues, profits or losses, assets and liabilities
(1)
 The  Group’s  chief  operating  decision  maker  evaluates  the  performance  and  allocates  resources  to  its  operating  segments  on  an  operating
income basis, without considering the effects of finance costs or investment income. Inter-segment transfer pricing is based on the market price
or cost plus an appropriate margin, as specified by the Group’s policy.
Assets and liabilities dedicated to a particular segment’s operations are included in that segment’s total assets and liabilities. Segment assets
include all tangible and intangible assets, except for interest in associates and joint ventures, investments, deferred tax assets, cash and cash
equivalents, time deposits with financial institutions and other unallocated assets. Segment liabilities exclude short-term, income tax payable,
long-term debts, loans from Sinopec Group Company and fellow subsidiaries, deferred tax liabilities and other unallocated liabilities.

Except for Sinopec Kantons and Sinopec (Hong Kong) Limited, which are incorporated in Bermuda and Hong Kong respectively, all of the above
principal subsidiaries are incorporated and operate their businesses principally in the PRC. All of the above principal subsidiaries are limited
companies.
Note:
(i)Pursuant to the resolution of the Company’s Meeting of Board of Directors held on 19 February 2014, the Company’s business under its
marketing and distribution segment of the Group was injected to Marketing Company, a subsidiary of the Group on 1 April 2014.
On 12 September 2014, Marketing Company entered into the “Capital Injection Agreement relating to Marketing Company” with a number of
domestic  and  foreign  investors,  pursuant  to  which  the  investors  shall  subscribe  for  equity  interest  in  Marketing  Company  in  cash  upon  the
relevant approvals for this capital injection being obtained, an aggregate capital contribution of RMB 105.044 billion was made to the Marketing
Company by 25 investors, representing 29.58% equity interest in the Marketing Company on 6 March 2015.
(ii)The Group consolidated the financial statements of the entity because it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement
with the entity and has the ability to affect its return through its power over the entity.
(iii)Pursuant to the Share Repurchase Agreement and Disposal Agreement entered into between the Company and Yizheng Chemical Fibre
Co., Ltd. on 12 September 2014, Yizheng Chemical Fibre Co., Ltd. repurchased and cancelled the 40.25% of its equity interests held by the
Company in exchange for the transfer of its outgoing business to the Company, pursuant to which this business was injected into Yizheng
Chemical Fibre.
Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement between Sinopec Group Company and Yizheng Chemical Fibre Co., Ltd. on the same date, Yizheng
Chemical Fibre Co., Ltd. issued shares to Sinopec Group Company for the acquisition of a 100% equity interest of Sinopec Oilfield Service
Corporation (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sinopec Group Company). The above transactions were inter-conditional and were completed in
December 2014.
The Group accounted for the transaction pursuant to the Share Repurchase Agreement as a transaction with non-controlling interests since the
control of business had not been lost, which resulted in an increase in capital reserve of the Group’s consolidated financial statement amounting
to RMB 3,227 million and decrease of non-controlling interests amounting to RMB 2,867 million.
(iv)On 1 August 2014, GWEC acquired an additional 45% of the equity interest in shares in Ningxia Nenghua (GWEC previously held a 50%
equity interest) and obtained control of Ningxia Nenghua (a coal chemical producer) which the Group accounted for as a subsidiary of GWEC
thereafter. The cash consideration was RMB 2,593 million. The fair value of the 50% equity interest held before the business combination
was  RMB  2,881  million.  The  fair  value  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  Ningxia  Nenghua  primarily  include  construction  in  progress  (RMB
14,094 million), property, plant and equipment (RMB 3,293 million) and borrowings (RMB 11,862 million) and no goodwill was resulted from
the business combination.

36FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND FAIR VALUES
Overview
Financial assets of the Group include cash and cash equivalents, time deposits with financial institutions, investments, trade accounts receivable,
bills receivable, amounts due from Sinopec Group Company and fellow subsidiaries, amounts due from associates and joint ventures, available-
for-sale financial assets, derivative financial instruments and other receivables. Financial liabilities of the Group include short-term and long-term
debts,  loans  from  Sinopec  Group  Company  and  fellow  subsidiaries,  trade  accounts  payable,  bills  payable,  amounts  due  to  Sinopec  Group
Company and fellow subsidiaries, derivative financial instruments and other payables.
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its uses of financial instruments:
‧credit risk;
‧liquidity risk;
‧market risk.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment, oversight of the Group’s risk management framework, and developing and
monitoring the Group’s risk management policies.
The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and
controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market
conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and management controls and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined
and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. Internal audit department undertakes both
regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Group’s audit committee.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations,
and arises principally from the Group’s deposits placed with financial institutions and receivables from customers. To limit exposure to credit risk
relating to deposits, the Group primarily places cash deposits only with large financial institutions in the PRC with acceptable credit ratings. The
majority of the Group’s trade accounts receivable relate to sales of petroleum and chemical products to related parties and third parties operating
in the petroleum and chemical industries. Management performs ongoing credit evaluations of the Group’s customers’ financial condition and
generally does not require collateral on trade accounts receivable. The Group maintains an impairment loss for doubtful accounts and actual
losses have been within management’s expectations.
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, time deposits with financial institutions, trade accounts and bills receivables, derivative
financial instruments and other receivables, represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
 
 
 
142
36FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND FAIR VALUES (Continued)
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach in managing
liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed
conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. Management prepares monthly cash flow budget
to ensure that the Group will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group arranges and negotiates
financing with financial institutions and maintains a certain level of standby credit facilities to reduce the Group’s liquidity risk.
At 30 June 2015, the Group has standby credit facilities with several PRC financial institutions which provide borrowings up to RMB 299,319
million (2014: RMB 302,570 million) on an unsecured basis, at a weighted average interest rate of 2.46% per annum (2014: 3.51%). At 30 June
2015, the Group’s outstanding borrowings under these facilities were RMB 68,585 million (2014: RMB 78,983 million) and were included in
debts.
The following table sets out the remaining contractual maturities at the balance sheet date of the Group’s financial liabilities, which are based on
contractual  undiscounted  cash  flows  (including  interest  payments  computed  using  contractual  rates  or,  if  floating,  based  on  prevailing  rates
current at the balance sheet date) and the earliest date the Group would be required to repay:

Management believes that the Group’s current cash on hand, expected cash flows from operations and available standby credit facilities from
financial institutions will be sufficient to meet the Group’s working capital requirements and repay its short-term debts and obligations when they
become due.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The objective of market risk management
is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.

Currency risk
Currency risk arises on financial instruments that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency in which they are measured.
The  Group’s  currency  risk  exposure  primarily  relates  to  short-term  and  long-term  debts  and  loans  from  Sinopec  Group  Company  and  fellow
subsidiaries denominated in US Dollars, Japanese Yen and Hong Kong Dollars. The Group enters into foreign exchange contracts to manage its
currency risk exposure.
Included  in  short-term  and  long-term  debts  and  loans  from  Sinopec  Group  Company  and  fellow  subsidiaries  of  the  Group  are  the  following
amounts denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity to which they relate:

A 5 percent strengthening of Renminbi against the following currencies at 30 June 2015 and 31 December 2014 would have increased net profit
for the period/year of the Group by the amounts shown below. This analysis has been determined assuming that the change in foreign exchange
rates had occurred at the balance sheet date and had been applied to the foreign currency balances to which the Group has significant exposure
as stated above, and that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2014.

Other than the amounts as disclosed above, the amounts of other financial assets and liabilities of the Group are substantially denominated in the
functional currency of respective entity within the Group.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk exposure arises primarily from its short-term and long-term debts. Debts bearing interest at variable rates and at
fixed rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk and fair value interest rate risk respectively. The interest rates of short-term and long-
term debts, and loans from Sinopec Group Company and fellow subsidiaries of the Group are disclosed in Note 26.
As at 30 June 2015, it is estimated that a general increase/decrease of 100 basis points in variable interest rates, with all other variables held
constant,  would  decrease/increase  the  Group’s  net  profit  for  the  period  by  approximately  RMB  519  million  (2014:  RMB  1,040  million).  This
sensitivity analysis has been determined assuming that the change of interest rates was applied to the Group’s debts outstanding at the balance
sheet date with exposure to cash flow interest rate risk. The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2014.
Commodity price risk
The Group engages in oil and gas operations and is exposed to commodity price risk related to price volatility of crude oil, refined oil products
and chemical products. The fluctuations in prices of crude oil, refined oil products and chemical products could have significant impact on the
Group. The Group uses derivative financial instruments, including commodity futures and swaps, to manage a portion of this risk. As at 30 June
2015, the Group had certain commodity contracts of crude oil, refined oil products and chemical products designated as qualified cash flow
hedges and economic hedges. The fair values of these derivative financial instruments as at 30 June 2015 are set out in Notes 24 and 28.
As at 30 June 2015, it is estimated that a general increase/decrease of USD 10 per barrel in basic price of derivative financial instruments, with
all other variables held constant, would impact the fair value of derivative financial instruments, which would decrease/increase the Group’s profit
for the period by approximately RMB 727 million (2014: decrease/increase RMB 190 million), and decrease/increase the Group’s other reserves
by approximately RMB 17,984 million (2014: increase/decrease RMB 737 million). This sensitivity analysis has been determined assuming that
the change in prices had occurred at the balance sheet date and the change was applied to the Group’s derivative financial instruments at that
date with exposure to commodity price risk. The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2014.

Fair values
(i)Financial instruments carried at fair value
The following table presents the carrying value of financial instruments measured at fair value at the balance sheet date across the three levels of
the fair value hierarchy defined in IFRS 7, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’, with the fair value of each financial instrument categorised in its
entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to that fair value measurement. The levels are defined as follows:
‧
‧
‧
Level 1 (highest level): fair values measured using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical financial instruments.
Level 2: fair values measured using quoted prices in active markets for similar financial instruments, or using valuation techniques in
which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly based on observable market data.
Level 3 (lowest level): fair values measured using valuation techniques in which any significant input is not based on observable market
data.

Fair values (Continued)
(ii)Fair values of financial instruments carried at other than fair value
The disclosures of the fair value estimates, and their methods and assumptions of the Group’s financial instruments, are made to comply with the
requirements of IFRS 7 and IAS 39 and should be read in conjunction with the Group’s consolidated financial statements and related notes. The
estimated fair value amounts have been determined by the Group using market information and valuation methodologies considered appropriate.
However, considerable judgement is required to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented
herein  are  not  necessarily  indicative  of  the  amounts  the  Group  could  realise  in  a  current  market  exchange.  The  use  of  different  market
assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.
The  fair  values  of  the  Group’s  financial  instruments  carried  at  other  than  fair  value  (other  than  long-term  indebtedness  and  investments  in
unquoted equity securities) approximate their carrying amounts due to the short-term maturity of these instruments. The fair values of long-term
indebtedness are estimated by discounting future cash flows using current market interest rates offered to the Group for debt with substantially the
same characterisitics and maturities ranging from 0.77% to 5.40% (2014: 0.33% to 6.15%). The following table presents the carrying amount and
fair value of the Group’s long-term indebtedness other than loans from Sinopec Group Company and fellow subsidiaries at 30 June 2015 and 31
December 2014:
Carrying amount
Fair value
30 June 
 
   2015
 
   RMB million
86,317
      84,330
31 December 
   2014
 
   RMB million
115,767
      112,362
The Group has not developed an internal valuation model necessary to estimate the fair values of loans from Sinopec Group Company and
fellow subsidiaries as it is not considered practicable to estimate their fair values because the cost of obtaining discount and borrowing rates for
comparable borrowings would be excessive based on the Reorganisation, the Group’s existing capital structure and the terms of the borrowings.
Investments  in  unquoted  equity  securities  are  individually  and  in  the  aggregate  not  material  to  the  Group’s  financial  condition  or  results  of
operations. There are no listed market prices for such interests in the PRC and, accordingly, a reasonable estimate of fair value could not be
made without incurring excessive costs. The Group intends to hold these unquoted other investments in equity securities for long term purpose.
Except for the above items, the financial assets and liabilities of the Group are carried at amounts not materially different from their fair values at
30 June 2015 and 31 December 2014.
37ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The  Group’s  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  are  sensitive  to  accounting  methods,  assumptions  and  estimates  that  underlie  the
preparation of the interim financial statements. Management bases the assumptions and estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that it believes to be reasonable and which form the basis for making judgements about matters that are not readily apparent from
other sources. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates as facts, circumstances
and conditions change.
The selection of critical accounting policies, the judgements and other uncertainties affecting application of such policies and the sensitivity of
reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions are factors to be considered when reviewing the interim financial statements. The
significant accounting policies are set forth in Note 2. Management believes the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant
judgements and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated interim financial statements.
146
37ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (Continued)
Oil and gas properties and reserves
The accounting for the exploration and production’s oil and gas activities is subject to accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry.
There are two methods to account for oil and gas business activities, the successful efforts method and the full cost method. The Group has
elected to use the successful efforts method. The successful efforts method reflects the volatility that is inherent in exploring for mineral resources
in that costs of unsuccessful exploratory efforts are charged to expense as they are incurred. These costs primarily include dry hole costs, seismic
costs and other exploratory costs. Under the full cost method, these costs are capitalised and written-off or depreciated over time.
Engineering estimates of the Group’s oil and gas reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the
subjective judgements involved in developing such information. There are authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that have to
be met before estimated oil and gas reserves can be designated as “proved”. Proved and proved developed reserves estimates are updated at
least annually and take into account recent production and technical information about each field. In addition, as prices and cost levels change
from year to year, the estimate of proved and proved developed reserves also changes. This change is considered a change in estimate for
accounting purposes and is reflected on a prospective basis in relation to depreciation rates.
Future dismantlement costs for oil and gas properties are estimated with reference to engineering estimates after taking into consideration the
anticipated method of dismantlement required in accordance with industry practices in similar geographic area, including estimation of economic
life of oil and gas properties, technology and price level. The present values of these estimated future dismantlement costs are capitalised as oil
and gas properties with equivalent amounts recognised as provisions for dismantlement costs.
Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, these estimates are used in determining depreciation expense, impairment loss
and future dismantlement costs. Depreciation rates are determined based on estimated proved developed reserve quantities (the denominator)
and capitalised costs of producing properties (the numerator). Producing properties’ capitalised costs are amortised based on the units of oil or
gas produced.
Impairment for long-lived assets
If circumstances indicate that the net book value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable, the asset may be considered “impaired”, and an
impairment loss may be recognised in accordance with IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets”. The carrying amounts of long-lived assets are reviewed
periodically  in  order  to  assess  whether  the  recoverable  amounts  have  declined  below  the  carrying  amounts.  These  assets  are  tested  for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their recorded carrying amounts may not be recoverable. When such a
decline has occurred, the carrying amount is reduced to recoverable amount. For goodwill, the recoverable amount is estimated annually. The
recoverable amount is the greater of the net selling price and the value in use. It is difficult to precisely estimate selling price because quoted
market prices for the Group’s assets or cash-generating units are not readily available. In determining the value in use, expected cash flows
generated by the asset or the cash-generating unit are discounted to their present value, which requires significant judgement relating to level of
sale volume, selling price and amount of operating costs. Management uses all readily available information in determining an amount that is a
reasonable approximation of recoverable amount, including estimates based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections of
sale volume, selling price and amount of operating costs.
Depreciation
Property, plant and equipment, other than oil and gas properties, are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
assets, after taking into account the estimated residual value. Management reviews the estimated useful lives of the assets at least annually in
order to determine the amount of depreciation expense to be recorded during any reporting period. The useful lives are based on the Group’s
historical experience with similar assets and take into account anticipated technological changes. The depreciation expense for future periods is
adjusted if there are significant changes from previous estimates.
Impairment for bad and doubtful debts
Management estimates impairment losses for bad and doubtful debts resulting from the inability of the Group’s customers to make the required
payments. Management bases the estimates on the ageing of the accounts receivable balance, customer credit-worthiness, and historical write-
off experience. If the financial condition of the customers were to deteriorate, actual write-offs would be higher than estimated.
Allowance for diminution in value of inventories
If the costs of inventories become higher than their net realisable values, an allowance for diminution in value of inventories is recognised. Net
realisable  value  represents  the  estimated  selling  price  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business,  less  the  estimated  costs  of  completion  and  the
estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Management bases the estimates on all available information, including the current market prices of
the finished goods and raw materials, and historical operating costs. If the actual selling prices were to be lower or the costs of completion were
to be higher than estimated, the actual allowance for diminution in value of inventories could be higher than estimated.
38PARENT AND ULTIMATE HOLDING COMPANY
The directors consider the parent and ultimate holding company of the Group as at 30 June 2015 is Sinopec Group Company, a state-owned
enterprise established in the PRC. This entity does not produce financial statements available for public use.

(C)DIFFERENCES  BETWEEN  CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS  PREPARED  IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH  THE  ACCOUNTING
POLICIES COMPLYING WITH ASBE AND IFRS (UNAUDITED)
Other than the differences in the classifications of certain financial statements captions and the accounting for the items described below, there
are  no  material  differences  between  the  Group’s  consolidated  financial  statements  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  accounting  policies
complying with ASBE and IFRS. The reconciliation presented below is included as supplemental information, is not required as part of the basic
financial statements and does not include differences related to classification, presentation or disclosures. Such information has not been subject
to independent audit or review. The major differences are:
(I)GOVERNMENT GRANTS
Under  ASBE,  grants  from  the  government  are  credited  to  capital  reserve  if  required  by  relevant  governmental  regulations.  Under  IFRS,
government grants relating to the purchase of fixed assets are recognised as deferred income and are transferred to the income statement over
the useful life of these assets.
(II)SAFETY PRODUCTION FUND
Under  ASBE,  safety  production  fund  should  be  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  with  a  corresponding  increase  in  reserve  according  to  PRC
regulations. Such reserve is reduced for expenses incurred for safety production purposes or, when safety production related fixed assets are
purchased,  is  reduced  by  the  purchased  cost  with  a  corresponding  increase  in  the  accumulated  depreciation.  Such  fixed  assets  are  not
depreciated thereafter. Under IFRS, payments are expensed as incurred, or capitalised as fixed assets and depreciated according to applicable
depreciation methods.
Effects of major differences between the net profit under ASBE and the profit for the period under IFRS are analysed as follows:
