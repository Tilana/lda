<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its fifteenth session from 
21 January to 1 February 2013. The review of Romania was held at the 3rd meeting on 22 
January 2013. The delegation of Romania was headed by the Secretary of State, Bogdan 
Aurescu. At its 10th meeting, held on 25 January 2013, the Working Group adopted the 
report on Romania. 
</p>
<p>2. On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Romania: Czech Republic, Kenya and Qatar. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
Romania: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/15/ROU/1); 
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/15/ROU/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/15/ROU/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, 
Slovenia, Sweden, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 
was transmitted to Romania through the troika. These questions are available on the 
extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The head of the delegation presented the national report and highlighted several 
measures undertaken and achievements made by Romania in the implementation of 
recommendations put forward during the 2008 universal periodic review. The delegation 
stated that the national report, which had been prepared based on a broad consultation with 
various State agencies, the national human rights institution and civil society 
representatives, provided comprehensive information on main measures taken to implement 
each of the accepted recommendations of the 2008 review. 
</p>
<p>6. The delegation stated that the legal system concerning the protection of human 
rights was complex and encompassed several institutions that complemented each other 
without overlapping. Thus, the Romanian Institute for Human Rights, the National Council 
for Combating Discrimination and the Ombudsman had complementary competences that 
included preventing all forms of discrimination; mediating cases of discrimination; 
investigating and sanctioning discrimination cases; organizing public opinion polls on 
various aspects regarding human rights protection; receiving complaints filed by 
individuals who have been aggrieved by public administration authorities through 
violations of their civic rights and freedoms and taking decisions on such complaints; 
providing victims of discrimination with specialized assistance; and notifying the 
Constitutional Court on the unconstitutionally of laws before their promulgation. </p>


<p>7. The delegation highlighted the importance for Romania of the protection of the 
culture and identity of persons belonging to national minorities, and indicated that Romania 
had ratified the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the 
European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Those two international 
instruments, along with the domestic legislative framework, represented important 
guarantees for an efficient protection of the rights of persons belonging to national 
minorities. 
</p>
<p>8. The delegation stated that in the framework of the antidiscrimination policies, the 
situation of the Roma minority remained of special concern. Romania had adopted a 
package of legal instruments in order to provide the authorities with the necessary 
instruments to efficiently combat discrimination against the Roma and protect vulnerable 
groups. The National Council for Combating Discrimination and the Ombudsman were the 
main institutions that contributed to effective enforcement of the anti-discrimination 
legislation and to the legal protection of the Roma population. 
</p>
<p>9. The delegation stated that as the necessity of a coherent approach towards improving 
the social integration of Roma had been acknowledged by Romania since 2000, policies 
and programmes had been carried out by the Government in the past decade in the 
framework of the national strategy for 2001-2011, which had envisaged measures in the 
areas of education, social protection and employment, culture, combating discrimination 
and promoting access to information and intercultural and inter-ethnic dialogue. Romania 
had adopted a new strategy for the inclusion of Romanian citizens belonging to the Roma 
minority for the period of 2012-2020, which was a multidimensional and comprehensive 
document aimed at joining the efforts of the central and local authorities, the Roma 
community and civil society and at continuing to address the social inclusion of Roma. The 
new Roma strategy focused on six areas: education, employment, health, housing and small 
infrastructure, culture, and social infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>10. The Romanian system of promotion and protection of the rights of persons 
belonging to national minorities allowed the Roma minority to be politically represented 
and to participate in the decision-making process at all levels, central and local. Following 
the previous local elections of June 2012 and the parliamentary elections of December 
2012, the Roma community was being represented in the Parliament by three members: two 
deputies and one senator, and at the local level by one Roma mayor and 161 members of 
local councils. 
</p>
<p>11. To address the drop-out rate in schools, the authorities had combined measures 
aimed at stimulating school attendance with those measures that were intended to identify 
children at risk of dropping out or who do not attend school, and to prevent such cases. The 
institution of the school mediators had been proven to be a useful instrument to monitor the 
situation and to prevent drop-out cases as well as deal with the school attendance of Roma 
pupils. There were currently 923 trained school mediators, of whom 437 were employed in 
the county school inspectorates, local authorities and county councils. 
</p>
<p>12. Regarding the administration of justice, major progress had been achieved in 
reforming and finalizing the legislative framework and putting in place and consolidating 
the relevant institutions, as well as implementing the newly adopted measures. Law No. 
202/2010 (Small Reform Law) had already introduced a series of measures to simplify and 
render more efficient judicial procedures, including the length of proceedings, and thus 
anticipating the entry into force of the new procedural codes. An unprecedented legislative 
reform consisted of four new codes adopted by the Parliament in 2009 and 2010, aimed at 
simplifying and making the judicial practice more efficient. The new Civil Code had 
entered into force on 1 October 2011. The entry into force of the other three codes would 
follow in 2013 and 2014. </p>


<p>13. As to the strengthening of the accountability of magistrates, a new law on the matter 
had entered into force in January 2012. The law amended the scheme of disciplinary 
offences, increased sanctions, and strengthened the independence and the operational 
capacity of the Judicial Inspection of the Superior Council of Magistracy. Measures had 
also been taken for improving the transparency and objectivity of the procedure for the 
promotion of judges to the High Court of Cassation and Justice. Thus, the relevant law was 
already in force following its adoption by the Parliament in December 2011. 
</p>
<p>14. The delegation highlighted that Romania was the first European country to create a 
National Integrity Agency (NIA), which had been operational since 2007. The Agency was 
an independent, operational institution, competent to control and verify declared assets of 
public officials and cases of conflict of interest. Effective institutions were in place to 
prevent and combat high-level corruption; some of those were novelties at the European 
level or had achieved such significant results that they had become best practices for other 
countries (for example, NIA and the National Anti-corruption Directorate). 
</p>
<p>15. The National Anti-corruption Directorate had consistent and positive results, 
functioning as a specialized and independent structure competent to investigate high-level 
corruption cases. During the previous five years, over 90 per cent of its indictments had led 
to convictions and 90 per cent of investigations had been finalized in under 1.5 years. That 
activity continued to include significant numbers of senior politicians and officials. 
Regarding the prevention of and fight against local-level corruption and corruption in 
vulnerable areas, the National Anti-corruption Strategy, its corresponding action plan and 
the inventory of preventive measures had been approved by the Government in March 
</p><p>2012. The new Government assumed the Strategy in May 2012 and in June the Parliament 
unanimously endorsed the Strategy through a political declaration; implementation was 
ongoing. 
</p>
<p>16. The delegation highlighted the major role of media in promoting a culture of 
tolerance and mutual understanding. From this perspective, media awareness-raising 
programmes, such as &#8220;Colourful, but colour-blind&#8221;, &#8220;Dosta, overcome prejudices, learn to 
know Roma people&#8221;, and &#8220;Voices of the Roma community in society&#8221; had increased 
awareness on that matter. 
</p>
<p>17. Regarding the situation of sexual minorities, the delegation reported that the 
legislation provided for punishment for any form of discrimination based on gender and 
sexual orientation. The main form of public expression of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender (LGBT) community was the GayFest, organized annually in March. Due to the 
involvement of the public authorities that ensured the public order and close cooperation 
with the non-governmental organization ACCEPT, which was the main promoter of LGBT 
rights in Romania, the number of incidents during the event had significantly reduced to the 
extent that in the past two years, the event had taken place without any incident. 
</p>
<p>18. The delegation stated that Romania had constantly developed policies and 
implemented specific measures aimed at improving every citizen&#8217;s health and access to 
health care, especially for vulnerable groups. Although there was no strategy implemented 
at the moment in the field of sexual and reproductive health, the Ministry of Health had 
adopted targeted measures that had led to a gradual decrease in the abortion mortality rate. 
</p>
<p>19. On the issue of the rights of the child, the delegation stated that the top objectives of 
the 2008&#8211;2013 national strategy on children rights&#8217; protection and its plan of action was to 
guarantee the improvement of the situation of children in a special protection system, 
further develop community services and ensure equal treatment for all children. 
</p>
<p>20. With regard to combating human trafficking, the National Strategy against 
Trafficking in Persons for 2012&#8211;2016 set up the framework of action for combating the 
phenomenon. The current National Strategy put forward a number of concrete measures </p>


<p>aimed at preventing trafficking in human beings. Increasing the level of understanding of 
the dimensions, forms and implications of trafficking in human beings was essential for any 
successful prevention. In that respect, the mass media could play an important role in 
supporting and promoting clear-cut public information messages regarding the 
phenomenon. Organizing workshops for media representatives on the specificities of 
trafficking in human beings, including children, ensured the adequate promotion by the 
mass media of the anti-trafficking messages, the promotion of an accurate and complete 
perspective of such crime and the eradication of stereotypes regarding the victim profile 
and the forms of exploitation. 
</p>
<p>21. Regarding the protection of child victims of trafficking, the 2011 legislation 
established complementary detailed procedures with respect to identification and referral. 
Also, as a supplementary measure to ensure victims&#8217; access to specialized assistance, 
</p>
<p>regardless of their participation in the criminal proceedings, a clear definition of the term 
&#8220;victim of trafficking&#8221; had been introduced in 2010. 
</p>
<p>22. For victims willing to participate in the criminal trial, the National Agency against 
Trafficking in Human Beings initiated, in 2008, the Victim Coordination during Criminal 
Proceedings progamme. Its objective is different from that of the social assistance for 
rehabilitation and reintegration. In 2012, the victim coordination programme was further 
developed by including new partners: the General Inspectorate for Immigration and the 
Probation Directorate of the Ministry of Justice. 
</p>
<p>23. With respect to the cooperation of Romania with United Nations human rights 
mechanisms, the delegation highlighted the country&#8217;s commitment to address its backlog of 
reporting to the treaty bodies. In that respect, Romania had submitted a common core 
document as well as reports to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and 
the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. Romania had hosted three 
visits of special rapporteurs and agreed in principle to the visit of the Working Group on 
discrimination against women in law and in practice. Romania had also ratified the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and the Optional Protocol to 
the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment (OP-CAT) and would step up its efforts in view of a possible ratification of the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance 
(CPED) and the Optional Protocol to CRPD (OP-CRPD). The delegation confirmed the 
commitment of Romania to the protection and promotion of human rights.

of 20 minorities had been elected to represent their minority groups&#8217; interest in the </p>


<p>Parliament, including representatives of the Hungarian and Roma minorities. The 2012 
local elections also ensured representatives of many ethnic minorities, including Hungarian, 
Roma, Russian and German, in the local governing bodies. The delegation also noted that a 
number of State bodies functioned to protect the interest of ethnic minorities. The 
legislation and Constitution also guaranteed the use of minority languages in courts and the 
public administration, as well as in local administrations, for minority groups constituting 
more than 20 per cent of the residents. 
</p>
<p>63. In response to the question on the restitution of properties nationalized during the

discrimination, prevention of torture, child labour, rights of migrants and asylum 
procedures were also provided to police officers. 
</p>

status and effectiveness of the Ombudsman institution. Slovenia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>67. Spain commended Romania on its ratification of OP-CAT and CRPD in fulfilment 
of the first UPR cycle recommendations. It asked what specific measures had been adopted 
to prevent and combat corruption in the judiciary and public health sectors. Spain made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>68. Sri Lanka noted the national cooperation mechanism to prevent child trafficking and 
initiatives to improve access to education. Initiatives to eliminate domestic violence, 
establish the National Mental Health and Anti-drug Centre, strengthen measures to combat 
human trafficking, and improve the investigation of human trafficking at the national level 
were commended. Sri Lanka made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>69. Sweden noted the greater role given to municipalities in integrating Roma into 
society under the new Roma inclusion strategy. However, it stated that a lack of accurate 
statistical information and collaboration with civil society might result in efforts not being 
entirely adapted to the community&#8217;s needs. Sweden made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>70. Switzerland noted that the role of Romania in secret detention centres or prisoner 
transfers had not been clarified in investigations. It also noted that Romania had not fully 
implemented the first UPR cycle recommendation that domestic legislation on housing 
meet obligations established in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights. Switzerland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>71. Thailand noted judicial reforms to ensure basic human rights for all, especially 
access to justice for victims of violence and human trafficking and improvements to </p>


<p>detention conditions. It supported the efforts of Romania to raise public awareness of 
multicultural diversity, harmony and tolerance. Thailand made recommendations. 
</p>

</p>
<p>75. Ukraine encouraged Romania to continue efforts to combat negative perceptions of 
minorities through public awareness-raising and education initiatives. It urged Romania to 
continue promoting equal access to adequate health services for HIV-affected persons,

recommendations.

<p>100. With regard to questions on the experience of Romania in bringing its legislation 
into conformity with international human rights standards, the delegation emphasized that, 
according to the Constitution, treaties on human rights to which the country was party were 
part of national law and were applied with priority in relation to domestic law. Romania 
noted that, consequently, the domestic courts gave direct effect to, for example, the 
European Convention on Human Rights and the case law of the European Court. 
</p>
<p>101. On the question regarding results obtained in combating corruption, Romania 
reiterated particularly that effective institutions had been put in place to combat corruption.

</p>
<p>103. On the remarks made regarding secret detention centres and illegal transfers of 
persons, the delegation stated that Romania had approached this issue in a spirit of 
profound attachment to the rule of law and promotion and protection of human rights. It 
was noted that a Parliamentary inquiry committee had carried out an investigation between 
2005 and 2008. The Committee&#8217;s conclusions were public and attested that the authorities 
had no information that CIA secret detention centres ever existed in Romania or that the 
country&#8217;s airports could have been used by the CIA for transfer or detention of suspected 
terrorists. The delegation stated that, following a request to the judicial authorities in 2012 
by a person being detained in Guantanamo, the judiciary had opened a criminal 
investigation which was currently under way. The head of the delegation gave assurances </p>


<p>that authorities would carry out the investigation with the full respect of the principles of 
rule of law and human rights.

materials and school textbooks, the delegation stated that it had no information of such

since 2000, specific courses had been organized in schools to teach the history of the 
Holocaust. 
</p>
<p>105. On the issue of the segregation of Roma, the delegation stated that it had decreased 
significantly due to the actions taken by the Ministry of Education as well as various 
legislative measures. Various concrete activities had been carried out, including the creation 
of inclusive classes, where children feel that they are treated in the same way as others. 
</p>
<p>106. The delegation also presented some statistics in relation to employment, health and 
housing of Roma. Roma were employed in the labour market because of State assistance, 
including counselling and professional training. The National Agency for Employment used 
a set of personalized stimulation measures, giving each person the opportunity to benefit 
from one or more services. As to the access of Roma to health services, the delegation 
highlighted two initiatives: health mediators&#8217; services and vaccination campaigns. The pilot 
programme Social Housing for Roma Communities, which is conducted by the National 
Housing Agency, comprises a plan for the construction of 300 social housing units in 11 
cities, with easy access for Roma to education and to health and social services. 
</p>
<p>107. On the issue of trafficking in persons, the delegation highlighted that the efficiency 
of governmental bodies that work to combat human trafficking had improved. The number 
of convictions had increased, with 276 traffickers convicted in 2011. The number of victims 
referred to assistance doubled. Furthermore, the participation of victims in the criminal 
process improved as a result of different approaches taken for their protection and 
assistance. 
</p>
<p>108. The delegation expressed its gratitude to all delegations for their participation, 
comments and questions. The delegation stated that Romania would closely analyse the 
recommendations and provide its answer to them in due time. The delegation expressed its 
regret that it was not in a position to provide answers to all questions due to time 
constraints.<b>
