</b></p>
<p>(30 July 2004) 
</p>
<p><b>Article 13:  Human rights 
</b></p>
<p> The Ivorian parties recognise that restoration of long-term peace and stability requires 
respect for human rights and the rule of law. In this regard, they agree to cooperate fully with the 
International Commission of Inquiry, which has been established in accordance with the 
Linas-Marcoussis Agreement to look into the human rights violations committed in 
C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire since the beginning of the crisis on 19 September 2002.

</p>
<p><b>Annex:  Programme of the Government of National Reconciliation 
</b></p>
<p><b>Section VI:  Rights and freedoms of the individual 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Government of National Reconciliation will immediately set up a National 
Human Rights Commission to ensure protection of rights and freedoms in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire &#8230; 
</p>

impunity. The Round Table particularly condemns the actions of the &#8220;death squads&#8221; and those 
giving them orders as well as those carrying out summary executions throughout the country, 
and considers that those guilty of and those aiding and abetting these acts must be brought to 
justice before an international criminal jurisdiction. </p>

</p>
<p> The Parties to the Kenyan National Dialogue and Reconciliation agree to the following 
general parameters and principles &#8230; 
</p>
<p> A Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation Commission (&#8220;the Commission&#8221;) will be created 
through an Act of Parliament, which will be adopted by the legislature within the next four 
weeks. 
</p>
<p> The Commission will inquire into human rights violations, including those committed by 
the state, groups, or individuals. This includes but is not limited to politically motivated violence, 
assassinations, community displacements, settlements, and evictions. The Commission will also 
inquire into major economic crimes, in particular grand corruption, historical land injustices, and 
the illegal or irregular acquisition of land, especially as these relate to conflict or violence. Other 
historical injustices shall also be investigated. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/18/Add.1 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p> The Commission will inquire into such events which took place between 
December 12, 1963 and February 28, 2008. However, it will as necessary look at antecedents 
to this date in order to understand the nature, root causes, or context that led to such violations, 
violence, or crimes. 
</p>
<p> The Commission shall receive statements from victims, witnesses, communities, interest 
groups, persons directly or indirectly involved in events, or any other group or individual; 
undertake investigations and research; hold hearings; and engage in activities as it determines to 
advance national or community reconciliation. The Commission may offer confidentiality to 
persons upon request, in order to protect individual privacy or security, or for other reasons &#8230; 
</p>
<p> No blanket amnesty will be provided for past crimes. Individual amnesty may be 
recommended by the Commission in exchange for the full truth, provided that serious 
international crimes (crimes against humanity, war crimes, or genocide) are not amnestied, nor 
persons who bear the greatest responsibility for crimes covered by the Commission. 
</p>
<p> The Commission will complete its work and submit a final report within two years. The 
final report shall state its findings and recommendations, which will be submitted to the 
President and will be made public in fourteen days and tabled in Parliament. 
</p>
<p>&#8230; 
</p>
<p> In keeping with international best practices, and to ensure broad public trust in and 
ownership of the process of seeking the truth, the national members of the Commission shall be

Eminent African Personalities (The Panel), agree to the establishment of a <i>Commission of

</p>
<p> This Commission of Inquiry will be a non-judicial body mandated (i) to investigate the 
facts and surrounding circumstances related to acts of violence that followed the 2007

the course of the violence, and make recommendation as necessary, and (iii) to recommend 
measures of a legal, political or administrative nature, as appropriate, including measures with 
regard to bringing to justice those persons responsible for criminal acts. The Commission of 
Inquiry aims to prevent any repetition of similar deeds and, in general, to eradicate impunity and 
promote national reconciliation in Kenya. </p>

<p>4.1 All delegations recognize that impunity for acts of political violence is a serious

light on the acts of political violence committed during the period from 1958 to the present

<p><b>Agreement on Accountability and Reconciliation  </b> (29 June 2007) 
</p>
<p>&#8230; 
</p>
<p><b>2. COMMITMENT TO ACCOUNTABILITY AND RECONCILIATION 
</b></p>
<p>2.1 The Parties shall promote national legal arrangements, consisting of formal and non-formal 
institutions and measures for ensuring justice and reconciliation with respect to the conflict. 
2.2 The accountability processes stipulated in this Agreement shall relate to the period of the 
conflict. However, this clause shall not prevent the consideration and analysis of any relevant 
matter before this period, or the promotion of reconciliation with respect to events that occurred 
before this period. 
</p>
<p>2.3 The Parties believe that a comprehensive, independent and impartial analysis of the history 
and manifestations of the conflict, especially the human rights violations and crimes committed 
during the course of the conflict, is an essential ingredient for attaining reconciliation at all 
levels. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/18/Add.1 
  page 27 
 
</p>
<p>2.4 The Parties agree that at all stages of the development and implementation of the principles 
and mechanisms of this Agreement, the widest possible consultations shall be promoted and 
undertaken in order to receive the views and concerns of all stakeholders, and to ensure the 
widest national ownership of the accountability and reconciliation processes. Consultations shall 
extend to state institutions, civil society, academia, community leaders, traditional and religious 
leaders, and victims. 
</p>
<p>&#8230; 
</p>
<p><b>3. PRINCIPLES OF GENERAL APPLICATION 
</b></p>
<p>3.1 Traditional justice mechanisms, such as <i>Culo Kwor</i>,<i> Mato Oput</i>,<i> Kayo Cuk</i>, <i>Ailuc</i> and <i>Tonu 
ci Koka</i> and others as practiced in the communities affected by the conflict, shall be promoted, 
with necessary modifications, as a central part of the framework for accountability and 
reconciliation. 
</p>
<p>&#8230; 
</p>
<p>3.4 In the conduct of accountability and reconciliation processes, measures shall be taken to 
ensure the safety and privacy of witnesses. Witnesses shall be protected from intimidation or

</b></p>
<p>4.1 Formal criminal and civil justice measures shall be applied to any individual who is alleged

special justice processes under this Agreement. 
&#8230; 
</p>
<p><b>5. LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p>5.1 The Parties affirm that Uganda has institutions and mechanisms, customs and usages as 
provided for and recognised under national laws, capable of addressing the crimes and human 
rights violations committed during the conflict. The Parties also recognise that modifications 
may be required within the national legal system to ensure a more effective and integrated justice 
and accountability response. 
</p>
<p>5.2 The Parties therefore acknowledge the need for an overarching justice framework that will 
provide for the exercise of formal criminal jurisdiction, and for the adoption and recognition of 
complementary alternative justice mechanisms. 
5.3 Alternative justice mechanisms shall promote reconciliation and shall include traditional 
justice processes, alternative sentences, reparations, and any other formal institutions or 
mechanisms. </p>

through existing national institutions and mechanisms, with necessary modifications. The Parties 
shall consult on the need to introduce any additional institutions or mechanisms for the 
implementation of this Agreement.

accountability and reconciliation proceedings, consistently with the rights of the other parties in

victims through mechanisms to be adopted by the Parties upon further consultation. 
</p>
<p>9.3 Reparations, which may be ordered to be paid to a victim as part of penalties and sanctions 
in accountability proceedings, may be paid out of resources identified for that purpose. 
</p>
<p><b>10. GENDER
