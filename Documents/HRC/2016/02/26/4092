<p>Overview of international and regional standards and commitments concerning  
child-sensitive counselling, reporting and complaint mechanisms to address  
incidents of violence against children, including sexual violence and exploitation..........................  24 </p>


<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Context 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 13/20,1 the Human Rights Council invited the Special Rapporteur on 
the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and the Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children to report to the Council at its 
sixteenth session on effective and child-sensitive counselling, complaint and reporting 
mechanisms to which children can safely report incidents of violence, including sexual 
violence and exploitation. The Council invited them to cooperate with States and other 
relevant partners such as the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Special 
Representatives of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict and on Sexual 
Violence in Conflict, national human rights institutions, United Nations agencies, regional 
organizations, civil society organizations and children themselves. 
</p>
<p>2. The need to establish safe, well-publicized, confidential and accessible mechanisms 
for children has been a serious concern voiced by both the Special Rapporteur on the sale of 
children and the Special Representative on violence against children and addressed by the 
United Nations study on violence against children (&#8220;United Nations study&#8221;, see A/61/299). 
Violence is seldom reported and in many circumstances children feel pressed to conceal it, 
particularly when it is perpetrated by people they know and trust. The United Nations study 
recommended that mechanisms be established, including telephone helplines, through 
which children can report abuse, speak to a trained counsellor in confidence and ask for 
support and advice. It underscored the need to make all children aware of such 
mechanisms, and recommended that in every locality and every setting there should be 
well-publicized and easily accessible services to investigate reports of violence against 
children.  
</p>
<p>3. Over the past years, the promotion of child-sensitive mechanisms has gained 
increasing relevance, including as a result of the recognition of the right to accessible and 
effective remedies by international human rights instruments and of the significant 
jurisprudence of treaty-monitoring bodies in this area. The Committee on the Rights of the 
Child has addressed this question in its dialogue with State parties and in several general 
comments, including the most recent on the right of the child to freedom from all forms of 
violence.<footnote name="2">. The Convention on the Rights of the Child recognizes the right to freedom from 
violence in its many forms and promotes a comprehensive system of child protection to 
address this phenomenon; it calls on violence prevention, on victims&#8217; identification, 
treatment, recovery and reintegration, as well as on the referral and investigation of 
incidents of violence. Several articles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child address 
children&#8217;s protection from violence, particularly articles 19, 24, 28, 34 to 36, 37 and 39.  
</footnote> 
</p>
<p>4. Significant political commitments have also been made in this area. The declaration 
and call for action agreed upon at the Third World Congress against Sexual Exploitation of 
Children and Adolescents calls upon States to establish, by 2013, an effective and 
accessible system for reporting, follow-up and support for child victims of sexual 
exploitation. 
</p>
<p>5. Despite these significant developments, many challenges remain. In their missions 
across regions, both the Special Representative on violence against children and the Special 
Rapporteur on the sale of children have observed that counselling, complaint and reporting 
services are frequently unavailable and, when they exist, tend to lack the necessary 
resources and skills to address children&#8217;s concerns and promote children&#8217;s healing and 
reintegration. Moreover, children lack trust in them, fearing they will not be believed, and 
that they may endure further stigmatization, harassment, abandonment or reprisals if they 
</p>

<p>make known any incidents of violence. In most cases, children are unaware of the existence 
of such services, lacking information about where to go and whom to call to benefit from 
advice and assistance, to overcome trauma and re-shape their lives. Overall, they feel 
uncertain as to whether and how impunity can be fought.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Objectives 
</b></p>
<p>6. With these concerns in mind, the report was developed with the following 
objectives: 
</p>
<p> (a) To provide an overview of available models of accessible and child-sensitive 
counselling, complaint and reporting mechanisms established at the governmental level, 
and as developed by independent institutions and civil-society and community-based 
organizations;  
</p>
<p> (b) To draw attention to positive developments, as well as challenges, in the use 
of such mechanisms, including in terms of accessibility, confidentiality, child participation, 
effectiveness, safeguard of privacy and protection of victims of violence, including sexual 
violence and exploitation; 
</p>
<p> (c) To highlight legal obligations, roles and responsibilities of State institutions 
and other key stakeholders;  
</p>
<p> (d) To make recommendations for the strengthening of effective, child-sensitive 
counselling, complaint and reporting mechanisms to protect children from violence. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>7. The report was developed with the following methodological approach: 
</p>
<p> (a)<b> </b>A literature review of relevant documentation; 
</p>
<p> (b)<b> </b>An expert consultation organized by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights and the Office of the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on Violence Against Children, with the participation of the Special 
Rapporteur on the sale of children, and a cross-regional group of governmental and non-
governmental experts, national independent institutions for children&#8217;s rights, United 
Nations agencies and the Committee on the Rights of the Child;   
</p>
<p> (c)<b> </b>Request for information<b> </b>sent to Permanent Missions to the United Nations, as 
well as to United Nations departments, funds, programmes and specialized agencies, and 
other regional and inter-governmental organizations, which generated significant 
contributions.<footnote name="3">5 For example, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the Inter-American Commission on 
Human Rights, the European Committee of Social Rights and the European Court of Human Rights. </footnote> A questionnaire circulated to UNICEF country offices also yielded

Peacebuilding Office in the Central African Republic (BINUCA), International Labour Organization 
(ILO), United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UNICRI), United Nations 
Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI), United 
Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau (UNIOGBIS), Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), Innocenti 
Research Centre, and the World Food Programme (WFP). </p>


<p>significant information.<footnote name="4">4 Para. 87 (c). </footnote> The NGO Advisory Council for follow-up to the United Nations 
study, the Danish Refugee Council and Plan International also provided valuable 
information to the report;  
</p>
<p> (d)<b> </b>Voices of young people were essential, including as derived from studies and 
surveys and children&#8217;s recommendations, and from the experience of the authors of the 
present report through their work and meetings held with young people. 
</p>
<p>8. Only a selection of the wealth of experiences and initiatives on which information 
was received is outlined in the present report. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Conceptual and normative framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Conceptual framework 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Convention on the Rights of the Child defines a child as a person under the age 
of 18. The Convention recognizes children&#8217;s freedom from violence in several of its 
provisions,<footnote name="5">1 For example, in Mauritius, the hotlines are provided by the police and the Ministry of Gender 
Equality, Child Development and Family Welfare, while in Switzerland they are provided by the 
foundation Pro Juventute. 
</footnote> especially in article 19 on freedom from all forms of physical or mental 
violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, 
including sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person 
who has the care of the child.  
</p>
<p>10. The term &#8220;counselling&#8221; covers: the provision of information and advice to empower 
children and support others acting on children&#8217;s behalf regarding all courses of action 
required to prevent or respond to incidents of violence; legal counselling; and psychological 
or psychosocial counselling, that is, therapeutic interventions designed to prevent, mitigate 
or repair the mental, moral and social damage caused by violence, including to help address 
feelings of fear, guilt, shame and confusion children may experience.  
</p>
<p>11. Information and advice provided to children should be conveyed in a manner 
adapted to their age, maturity and circumstances, in language children can understand and 
which is gender- and culture-sensitive, and supported by child-friendly materials and 
information services.  
</p>
<p>12. There is no sharp conceptual distinction between complaints and reports. Complaints 
result from the failure to prevent violence and ensure the effective protection of victims. In 
the present report, the term &#8220;complaint&#8221; is used to refer to communications about violence 
made by victims or those acting on their behalf to some competent authority in the 
expectation of receiving protection, assistance or redress, including the investigation of 
incidents of violence and the imposition of sanctions against those found responsible. The 
term &#8220;reporting&#8221; is used here to refer to communications on incidents of violence made to 
the competent authorities by someone, be it a child or an adult, other than the victim.    
</p>
<p>13. The struggle to protect children from violence requires a holistic approach, 
involving: awareness-raising, prevention, law enactment and enforcement, and sound data 
and research; the protection, treatment, recovery and social reintegration of child victims; 
and the investigation and punishment of perpetrators. Although the present report is focused 
on counselling, complaint and reporting mechanisms, some brief comments on their links to 
other components of children&#8217;s freedom from violence are needed.  
</p>
<p>  
 4 Replies were received from 40 country offices in all regions. 
 5 Arts. 19, 28, para. 2, and 37. </p>


<p>14. First, advocacy and awareness-raising on children&#8217;s right to freedom from violence6 
are essential to promote more effective mechanisms. If violence remains pervasive and 
socially accepted, most children will not complain about it, most adults will not report 
violence against children, and professionals may hesitate to act.7 
</p>
<p>15. Second, complaints and reporting on violence against children are intimately related 
to the larger issues of criminal and child protection proceedings. Whether complaints and 
reports lead to appropriate legal or other relevant action is a key indicator of their 
effectiveness. Unfortunately, many challenges prevail with a persisting lack of information 
on the outcome of child protection and criminal proceedings involving child victims, on the 
gap between incidents reported and cases handled by the courts and other competent 
authorities, and on the impact of such proceedings on the children concerned.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. The normative framework 
</b></p>
<p>16. International standards frame the development of counselling, reporting and 
complaint mechanisms. These include the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its 
Optional Protocols, significant regional human rights instruments, as well as decisive 
commitments on children. An overview of these standards and commitments is included in 
the annex to the present report.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Current situation 
</b></p>
<p>17. States have a leading responsibility in safeguarding children&#8217;s protection from 
violence, through counselling, complaint and reporting mechanisms. Many other actors 
promote this goal, including national human rights institutions, civil-society organizations, 
in particular NGOs and community-based organizations, professional associations, 
religious groups, foundations and the private sector. Moreover, child participation is vital to 
break the invisibility of violence and inform child-sensitive approaches, including the 
development of safe and effective counselling, reporting and complaint mechanisms.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Voices of young people 
</b></p>
<p>18. Children&#8217;s views and recommendations helped shape the United Nations study and 
remain essential for its follow-up; they were also highly relevant in the special session of 
the General Assembly on children (8-10 May 2002) and in the three World Congresses 
against sexual exploitation of children and adolescents. Some of children&#8217;s key 
recommendations include: increased access to information on the rights of the child and 
accessibility to child-friendly services, including telephone helplines with free access; 
establishment of child protection agencies in local communities to protect vulnerable 
children; and the creation of an ombudsman&#8217;s office in each country. 
</p>
<p>19. During field missions and consultations held with children by the Special 
Representative and the Special Rapporteur, children complained about the lack or 
insufficient availability of such mechanisms and their inability to provide support in a safe, 
child-sensitive and effective manner. They recognized that mechanisms are insufficiently 
known by children, who have limited access to information, particularly in rural or remote

<p>areas; mechanisms are largely inaccessible to vulnerable children, including those with 
disabilities or belonging to minorities. Children voiced their lack of confidence in existing 
services and the fear that these may disclose children&#8217;s privacy and put them at risk of 
further harassment and reprisals.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Child-sensitive counselling, complaint and reporting mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Counselling mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>20. Violence against children, including sexual violence, continues to be surrounded by 
stigma and secrecy. Access to counselling, complaint and reporting procedures is thus 
imperative for children as well as adults who have endured violence during their childhood. 
</p>
<p>21. Research emphasizes that very young children, as well as children belonging to 
other vulnerable groups, are at particular risk of violence. For these children, special 
protection measures are essential to safeguard their rights and to ensure that they receive 
support from well-resourced institutions, services and professionals in a sensitive, relevant 
and ethical manner. 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Developments at the national level  
</i></p>
<p>22. In many countries important initiatives have been undertaken to raise public 
awareness about the need to protect children from violence, to promote non-violent and 
positive child-rearing and parenting skills, and to encourage child rights training for 
relevant professionals. Children&#8217;s skills in violence prevention are enhanced through child 
clubs and debates in school settings and peer-to-peer initiatives, such as trainings and 
awareness-raising offered by youth for young people in community spaces. These valuable 
initiatives enhance the understanding of what child victims may endure, and encourage 
those at risk to feel confident in seeking help and reporting incidents of violence. 
</p>
<p>23. Counselling mechanisms also provide children and adults with advice and 
information on where and how to seek advice and support, including to lodge complaints or 
report incidents of violence.8 In this regard, significant efforts have been deployed by 
Governments and members of civil society, including through media campaigns, 
distribution of flyers and information on hotline numbers and access to available services. 
</p>
<p>24. Most countries that contributed information to the present report indicated that 
dedicated arrangements for children were in place for counselling, reporting and complaints 
on incidents of violence against children. In some countries, ministries responsible for 
children and family affairs provide counselling services, including but not always 
specifically for children, and offer services such as emotional support, information, 
referrals and practical assistance. Several countries offer special counselling programmes 
for victims of crime, such as youth welfare offices and children&#8217;s shelters with specialized 
professionals (for example, psychologists, social workers, lawyers), and provide 
multidisciplinary child protection teams in paediatric hospitals.  
</p>
<p>25. Counselling services are also available through community-based organizations. A 
number of countries also reported that counselling services are provided by 
multidisciplinary teams, including child protection specialists, law enforcement officers, 
health-care workers, social workers, and social pedagogues and psychologists working in 
</p>
<p>  
 8 Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime (Economic and 
</p>
<p>Social Council resolution 2005/20). </p>


<p>schools. In almost all country contributions to the present report, telephone helplines are 
identified as an important aspect of counselling for children.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Key lessons and persisting challenges 
</i></p>
<p>26. The analysis conducted for the present report highlighted important lessons which 
should inform work in this area: 
</p>
<p> (a) Counselling is more effective when it is part of a broader approach that 
includes medical care, social assistance, legal services and financial or educational support. 
The support to be provided should be determined by a plan based on an assessment of the 
victim&#8217;s needs and circumstances, and implemented with close cooperation between service 
providers;9 
</p>
<p> (b) Counselling should be provided to the child and the family, as other members 
may also be victims; those who have not suffered violence in person may well suffer fear, 
guilt or anxiety. If the perpetrator of violence is a family member, he or she also should be 
offered therapy, at least until such time as the competent authorities may decide to take 
other action; although children have the right to be protected from all violence, whether or 
not protection requires removal of the offender from the home depends on the 
circumstances. Finally, the ultimate reason the family should be offered counselling is that 
&#8220;helping the family will often help the child&#8221;.10 
</p>
<p> (c) Ideally, counselling should be offered by qualified professionals;11 however, 
these are often scarce in many parts of the world. Specialized services for children are even 
scarcer, and often are lacking &#8220;in the vast majority of countries outside of Europe and the 
Americas&#8221;.12 
</p>
<p>27. Violence can have significant and life-long effects on the child&#8217;s mental health and 
development, and psychosocial support is critical for children&#8217;s recovery. As noted in the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, psychological recovery and social reintegration of 
child victims of violence should be promoted in an environment that fosters their health, 
self-respect and dignity (art. 39). 
</p>
<p>28. Psychosocial support should be provided by a &#8220;trusted, non-offending caregiver who 
takes the child&#8217;s situation seriously&#8221;.13 Counselling must not only be child-sensitive, but 
should also be &#8220;culturally sensitive&#8221; and take into account gender and factors such as 
disability and ethnicity.14<b> 
</b></p>
<p>29. Information received for the present report reveals that counselling programmes for 
children still face significant challenges. In their submissions, Governments mentioned 
shortages of specialized personnel, lack of training and resources, and lack of cooperation 
between relevant agencies; and acknowledged that services are mainly provided to children 
and their families in urban areas.

 14 Ibid., pp. 56 and 67. </p>


<p>30. Although in some countries the right to counselling is formally recognized, the 
services available are scarce and largely provided by voluntary agencies. Informal estimates 
indicate that less than 25 per cent of children in need of counselling services receive them.  
</p>
<p>31. Ensuring that all children, including those who have experienced violence, have 
access to child-sensitive and effective counselling is a daunting, long-term challenge. This 
neglected area should be strengthened, including through the promotion of sensitization and 
social-mobilization campaigns, the adoption of relevant legal, educational, and social 
measures, the training of relevant professionals, and the support of mental health services 
for children and adolescents. The empowerment and involvement of young people in the 
design and evaluation of these actions remains critical for their effectiveness. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Complaints mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>32. At the national level, different bodies receive complaints from children whose rights 
may have been violated. They include judicial and administrative authorities, and national 
independent human rights institutions, including ombudspersons for children. 
</p>
<p>33. Complaints mechanisms serve various purposes, including ensuring the protection of 
victims and the prevention of renewed acts of violence. Some mechanisms are designed to 
impose criminal sanctions on the offender. Others, including within school, social-welfare, 
law-enforcement and correctional systems, impose administrative responsibility in order to 
deter future acts of violence, or are designed to compensate the victim for damages 
suffered. Providing the victim with assistance is not the main purpose of complaint 
mechanisms, although it may be part of the response to complaints.  
</p>
<p>34. The concept of &#8220;complaint&#8221; implies that the body competent to receive it has legal 
powers to take appropriate action. In this sense, complaints are not addressed to civil 
society organizations, although these organizations may offer advice or assist in bringing 
complaints forward to the competent authorities. The contribution of civil society to making 
complaints mechanisms known, accessible, effective and child-friendly cannot be 
underestimated.  
</p>
<p><i> (a) The right of children to lodge complaints 
</i></p>
<p>35. In some counties, legislation recognizes a broad general right of children to lodge 
complaints before public authorities. The effectiveness of such legislation is closely 
associated with children&#8217;s access to information on their right to access justice and to 
complain before a judicial or non-judicial mechanism. The Costa Rican Children&#8217;s and 
Adolescents&#8217; Code, for example, provides that: &#8220;Persons under the age of majority shall 
have the right to seek shelter, help and advice when a threat to their rights entails a serious 
risk to their physical or spiritual health; and to receive timely assistance and protection 
from the competent authorities.&#8221;15The Paraguayan Children&#8217;s and Adolescents&#8217; Code 
recognizes the right of children to personally request any public body or official to take 
action that is within their mandate or competence, and to receive a timely reply.16 In 
Romania, Law No. 272/2004 on the protection and promotion of the rights of the child 
recognizes the child&#8217;s right to personally make complaints regarding violations of his or her 
fundamental rights.17In Spain, the law recognizes children&#8217;s right to receive from the public 
authorities adequate assistance in guaranteeing respect for their rights, including the right to

violations of their rights to the public prosecutor or the Ombudsman.18 
</p>
<p>36. Some laws recognize the legal standing of children to bring complaints to the 
attention of judicial authorities. Many of the children&#8217;s codes adopted in Latin America 
recognize this right.19 In the Philippines, child rights legislation expressly authorizes 
children to seek legal redress for violations of the rights recognized therein, including the 
right to be free from physical, sexual and psychological abuse.20 The Children&#8217;s Act (No. 
38 of 2005) of South Africa recognizes the right of children to seek judicial remedy for 
violations or threatened violations of the Act or of constitutionally recognized rights.21 
</p>
<p>37. In some countries the exercise of this right is limited to older children. In Russia, for 
example, children 14 or older can take legal action to seek protection from their parents or 
other persons exercising parental authority.22 In Tunisia, children over the age of discretion 
(13 years) may take legal action in &#8220;matters of special urgency and in the case of danger at 
home&#8221;.23 
</p>
<p>38. Where the right to seek a judicial remedy is limited to older children, younger 
children may turn to administrative bodies, which may initiate legal proceedings if they 
consider it appropriate. In Ecuador, for example, where children over the age of 12 &#8220;may 
personally take legal action for the protection of their rights&#8221;, younger children may request 
assistance to protect their rights when action concerning their legal guardian is needed.24 In 
the Russian Federation and Belarus, children of any age may make complaints to the 
competent administrative authorities concerning parents or other persons acting in loco 
parentis.25 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Administrative complaints 
</i></p>
<p>39. Some international instruments require the establishment of special complaints 
mechanisms within institutions for children. The Guidelines for the Alternative Care of 
Children, for example, provide that &#8220;children in care should have access to a known, 
effective and impartial mechanism whereby they can notify complaints or concerns 
regarding their treatment or conditions of placement&#8221;.26 The United Nations Rules for the 
Protection of Juveniles Deprived of Liberty indicate, inter alia, that children in closed 
facilities of any kind &#8220;should have the opportunity of making requests or complaints to the 
director&#8221;, and the right to make complaints to administrative and judicial authorities, and to 
be informed of the response without delay.27 Moreover, the Rules call for the establishment

<p>of an independent office, such as an ombudsman, to receive and investigate complaints 
made by juveniles deprived of their liberty and to assist in the achievement of settlements.28   
</p>
<p>40. Some countries have established specialized administrative procedures for children 
in specific contexts. In Slovenia, there is a procedure to investigate complaints regarding 
treatment of children by the police.29 The Costa Rican Children&#8217;s and Adolescents&#8217; Code 
recognizes the right of students to make complaints of physical, sexual or emotional abuse 
in schools.<footnote name="3">3 See for example the Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography, art. 8, para. 1 (g), and Economic and Social Council resolution 2005/20, para. 30 (c). </footnote>0According to the UNICEF survey, complaints procedures are available for law 
enforcement agencies, and also for the child welfare and school systems.  
</p>
<p><i> (c) Are complaints procedures child-sensitive? 
</i></p>
<p>41. Many norms and recommendations have been adopted on the sensitivity of 
proceedings concerning children affected by violence. They often focus on investigations 
and legal proceedings, although less on the receipt and handling of complaints, which are a 
critical initial stage of a legal or administrative process. In this regard, some principles 
should be respected: 
</p>
<p> (a) The right of the child to respect for his or her dignity at all times;  
</p>
<p> (b) The child&#8217;s right to privacy and to participation in meetings or interviews in a 
secure and reassuring environment;<footnote name="3">. The normative foundation provided by the Convention and its Protocols has 
generated significant legal reforms in countries in all regions aiming at the legal prohibition 
of all forms of violence against children, in any setting where violence may occur. 
Legislation is also needed to recognize children&#8217;s right to complaint procedures and 
remedies to address breaches of their rights and to support children&#8217;s access to courts and 
independent children&#8217;s rights institutions, such as an Ombudsman or a person of a 
comparable status. Children should know who these persons are, how to access them and 
what can be expected from this process.<footnote name="6">2 For example in Ireland, Wales and New Zealand. 
 63 For example in France. 
 64 For example in Ireland. 
 65 This is particularly the case in North America, Australia and New Zealand. </footnote>6 
</footnote>1 
</p>
<p> (c) The best interests of the child as a primary concern; 
</p>
<p> (d) The child&#8217;s right to protection from discrimination and to be treated in 
accordance with the principle of equality;  
</p>
<p> (e) Respect for the child&#8217;s views in addressing the complaint; 
</p>
<p> (f) The child&#8217;s right to be promptly provided with necessary information in an 
accessible language, including possible options and consequences of the complaint, 
procedures involved, and available protective measures and support services;  
</p>
<p> (g) Provision of appropriate professional or paraprofessional support to the child, 
including in overcoming the adverse physical, psychological and social consequences of the 
incident addressed by the complaint;32 
</p>
<p> (h) Decisions should be as expeditious as possible.33 
</p>
<p>42. Important community-based mechanisms have been established to address situations 
of violence against children, and to support women and children in their efforts to gain 
access to justice. The Paralegal Committees in Nepal work to prevent and address violence, 
including abuse and exploitation, and discrimination suffered by women and children. They 
promote awareness-raising activities, early detection and prevention, and case facilitation 
and reconciliation, as well as monitoring and reporting. They act as watch groups and as a

<p>bridge between communities and service providers, and help promote change in social 
attitudes that condone violence and hamper children&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>43. Several countries produce child-friendly materials to help children submit 
complaints and seek redress, including on available judicial or non-judicial complaint 
mechanisms and applicable proceedings. 
</p>
<p>44. Some countries reported having special complaints procedures for children. Many 
have established an independent child advocate, ombudsman or commission responsible for 
representing children&#8217;s rights, interests and viewpoints; in some cases, these institutions are 
competent to investigate complaints of child rights violations, to provide victims with 
redress, and to identify ex officio relevant areas of concern which they can pursue with 
competent authorities. Other measures include the establishment of children&#8217;s courts and 
special police brigades, as well as legal safeguards to extend the age for submitting 
complaints and compensation claims beyond 18 years.  
</p>
<p>45. Replies from countries reveal, however, that very few have evaluated the child-
friendliness of complaints and reporting procedures. This is an area where continued efforts 
should be pursued.  
</p>
<p><i> (d) Complaint procedures at the international level 
</i></p>
<p>46. In conformity with relevant human rights standards, complaint mechanisms have 
also been established at the international34 and regional35 levels. At present, an open-ended 
working group of the Human Rights Council is considering an optional protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child to establish a communications procedure.  
</p>
<p>47. Other human rights bodies and mechanisms, including special procedures, can 
receive allegations of children&#8217;s rights violations falling within their mandate. In practice, 
submissions are virtually never received from children themselves. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Reporting mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Mandatory reporting  
</i></p>
<p>48. Education on the rights of the child and knowledge about how and to whom violence 
can be reported are essential dimensions of an effective reporting system which should be 
child sensitive, supported by effective and well-resourced services and respectful of 
children&#8217;s rights.  
</p>
<p>49. In its general comment No. 13, the Committee on the Rights of the Child stresses 
that in every country the reporting of instances, suspicion or risk of violence should, at a 
minimum, be required by professionals working directly with children. When reports are 
made in good faith, processes must be in place to ensure the protection of the professional 
making the report. 
</p>
<p>  
 34 For example, article 77 of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
</p>
<p>Workers and Members of Their Families, and the Optional Protocols to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>

<p>50. Where reporting is mandatory, there are significant differences in the scope of the 
obligation to report. In some jurisdictions, the obligation is binding on all persons.36 Where 
it applies to professionals who work with children, those most often covered are law-
enforcement officers, social workers, teachers, childcare providers, medical doctors and 
other health-care workers.37Sometimes the obligation extends to other professions, 
including drug counsellors and probation officers. 
</p>
<p>51. Various forms of mandatory reporting were addressed by Government contributions 
to the present report. In most cases, the obligation relates to sexual, physical and 
psychological violence. 
</p>
<p>52. However, whether reporting is mandatory or not, its effectiveness depends on the 
quality of services that are available if the report, on examination, is found to be grounded. 
Requiring suspected abuse to be reported serves little purpose if the child protection system 
is weak, or if there is excessive reliance on institutionalization.38 The introduction of 
mandatory reporting has sometimes led to an increase in the number of reported cases that, 
following investigation, were not substantiated.39 Legislation that leads to overreporting 
increases the burden on the child welfare system, reducing its capacity to provide 
assistance.<footnote name="4">. This is an area addressed by core international human rights standards and to which 
the Committee on the Rights of the Child has devoted continued attention. In its most 
recent General Comment on The Right of the Child to Freedom from all Forms of 
Violence67, the Committee included importance guidance on these mechanisms, strongly 
recommending that &#8220;all States develop safe, well-publicized, confidential and accessible 
support mechanisms for children, their representatives and others to report violence against 
children, including through the use of 24-hour toil free hotlines and other information and 
communication technologies. The establishment of reporting mechanisms includes: 
providing appropriate information to facilitate the making of complaints; participation in 
investigations and court proceedings; developing protocols which are appropriate for 
different circumstances and made widely known to children and the general public; 
establishing support services for children and families; and training and providing on-going 
support for personnel to receive and advance the information received through reporting 
systems. Reporting mechanisms must be coupled with, and should present themselves as, 
help-oriented services offering public health and social support rather than as triggering 
responses which are primarily punitive. The children&#8217;s right to be heard and to have their 
views taken seriously has to be respected. In every country reporting of instances, suspicion 
</footnote>0 
</p>
<p>53. It is argued that the stronger the links are between the child protection system and 
the community, the less need there is for mandatory reporting, because child welfare 
personnel will become aware of most cases of violence without it. Mandatory reporting 
may also create an adversarial relationship between families and child protection 
authorities,41 and discourage families from seeking assistance voluntarily; and it can 
stigmatize families affected by extreme poverty and unemployment when the scope of 
mandatory reporting includes neglect.42 These concerns underline the need for mandatory 
reporting to be adapted to the needs and circumstances of each society.  
</p>
<p>54. Reporting by professionals who work with young children is especially important; 
these children are more susceptible to injury and unable to make complaints, and early 
detection and intervention can help reduce the risk of repeated abuse and long-term health 
and social consequences.43 
</p>
<p>55. The authors of the present report consider that some form of mandatory reporting, 
including the reporting by professionals who work with children, of sexual abuse and acts 
of violence causing physical injury and psychological violence is appropriate for all 
societies.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Mandatory reporting within specific systems 
</i></p>
<p>56. Mandatory reporting often presumes that a professional is in possession of 
information about violence caused by a third party with whom she or he has no institutional 
</p>
<p>  
 36 In the United States of America, such laws exist in 18 states (as at April 2010). See 
</p>
<p>www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/manda.cfm. 
 37 Of the replies to the UNICEF survey, 8 mention mechanisms that specifically address violence within 
</p>
<p>schools; 10 mention mechanisms that address violence within the child welfare system; and 13 
mention mechanisms that address violence within the law enforcement system.

<p>links. But mandatory reporting is also relevant in cases when acts of violence are 
committed by a colleague. The United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles 
Deprived of Liberty indicate: &#8220;Personnel who have reasons to believe that a serious 
violation of the present Rules has occurred or is about to occur should report the matter to 
their superior authorities or organs vested with reviewing or remedial power.&#8221;44 
</p>
<p>57. The Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children provide that all agencies and 
facilities for children in need of alternative care &#8220;should develop a staff code of conduct &#8230; 
[that] includes clear reporting procedures on allegations of misconduct by any team 
member&#8221; (para. 107). 
</p>
<p>58. Reporting is particularly important for those who provide medical or psychosocial 
assistance within residential facilities. The failure of such personnel to report evidence of 
violent treatment contributes to an atmosphere of impunity that can easily lead to a 
persistent pattern of violence.  
</p>
<p>59. In some countries, such as in the United States of America, federal law requires 
Internet service providers who have actual knowledge of child pornography on their servers 
to report such information to the CyberTipline of the National Center for Missing and 
Exploited Children. 
</p>
<p>60. The authors of the present report consider that standards establishing an obligation 
to report violence should be incorporated into the regulations or rules of conduct of all 
institutions or agencies that deal on a regular basis with children at risk of violence, such as 
residential facilities, schools, medical services for children and law enforcement bodies. 
</p>
<p><i> (c) Voluntary reporting 
</i></p>
<p>61. Several countries contributing to the present report mentioned the adoption of 
special measures to encourage the reporting of violence against children, including sexual 
violence perpetrated by tourists. One country reported that every citizen had an obligation 
to file a complaint in cases of child rights violations; another reported having in place 
legislation to protect those who report child abuse. In some countries, service providers in 
the child protection system or schools are obliged to signal a situation to the child welfare 
system, setting in motion procedures in cases of child abuse. In others, there are channels 
that allow children themselves to report a risky situation, through telephone hotlines 
established by such entities as the ombudsman. Some countries have special e-mail 
addresses or toll-free numbers, including for reporting suspected cases of child sexual 
exploitation of children on the Internet. One country reported that it is currently conducting 
an assessment of the obstacles faced by victims of crimes to make complaints. 
</p>
<p>62. Two thirds of the UNICEF country offices that responded to the questionnaire 
reported that the country in which they were based had established a programme to 
encourage voluntary reporting. However, most also reported that the law does not protect 
persons who make a report. 
</p>
<p>63. Another example of voluntary reporting is the Code of Conduct for the Protection of 
Children from Sexual Exploitation in Travel and Tourism. Tour operators and tourism 
organizations that adopt and sign the Code of Conduct commit to informing customers on 
their child protection policy, to training staff, to reporting and to applying other measures to 
protect children.  
</p>

<p>Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse 
requires States parties to ensure that the rules of confidentiality of information imposed on 
professionals who work with children do not constitute an obstacle to their reporting to 
child protection services; and to encourage &#8220;any person who knows about or suspects, in 
good faith, sexual exploitation or sexual abuse of children to report these facts to the 
competent services&#8221; (art. 12, paras. 1 and 2). 
</p>
<p>65. The authors of the present report consider that rules that protect the identity of 
professionals and private individuals who, in good faith, bring cases of violence against 
children to the attention of the competent authorities should be enacted into law, with 
respect to all forms of violence against children. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Interdisciplinary teams  
</b></p>
<p>66. In a growing number of countries, interdisciplinary teams respond to complaints and 
reports of violence against children. They help maintain the credibility and reliability of the 
child&#8217;s testimony, while securing children&#8217;s well-being and safety throughout the case. 
They limit the number of interviews the child may be subject to, and the risks that may be 
associated with this process. Some good practices are described here. 
</p>
<p>67. The Thuthuzela Care Centres (TCCs) were introduced as part of a strategy by South 
Africa to address sexual violence against women and children. A TCC is a one-stop shop 
where victims are provided with comprehensive services such as counselling, interviews, 
medical examination, court preparation and investigation in a holistic, integrated and 
victim-friendly manner. Through ongoing coordination with relevant stakeholders, 
including police, health-care professionals, prosecutors, social workers and NGOs, the 
ultimate goal of the TCC is to address the social and medical needs of the victim, reduce 
secondary victimization, improve conviction rates and reduce the lead time for the 
finalization of cases. The Thuthuzela Information Management System enables TCCs to 
become proactive, to test emerging models for efficiency and effectiveness, to develop 
corrective and rehabilitative offender programmes and to strive for integration rather than 
only punishment.   
</p>
<p>68. In Iceland and Sweden, <i>Barnahus</i> (&#8220;Children&#8217;s Houses&#8221;) have been established to 
provide children with assistance while also obtaining evidence that can be used in legal 
proceedings. Interviews with child victims of violence are held in a child-friendly 
environment, avoiding multiple interviews, enhancing the value of the evidence obtained 
and providing therapy and support. The model was adapted from the United States, where 
some 600 Children&#8217;s Advocacy Centers exist. With specially trained psychologists and 
social workers, the centres operate under a board composed of representatives of the 
relevant agencies, including the police, local hospital and social work authority. A 2008 
evaluation of Swedish <i>Barnahus</i> found that &#8220;the position of the child in the legal process 
was bolstered and the child&#8217;s perspective is considered in a higher degree than before. An 
increasing number of interviews and medical examinations took place and the children have 
been given better treatment and care in the acute crisis.&#8221; 45 
</p>
<p>69. Recognizing the invisibility of cases of violence and sexual violence against 
children, and the critical difficulties faced by victims in accessing justice, the Supreme 
Court of Argentina established in 2008 an Office of Domestic Violence. The Office 
operates 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Cases reported, including 28 per cent by 
children, involved incidents of physical violence (67 per cent), sexual violence (13 per cent) 
and psychological violence (90 per cent). Children are received in a child-friendly room, 
</p>
<p>  
 45  <i>Child Rights in the Union </i>(note 7 above), citing K. &#197;str&#246;m and A. Rejmer, p. 127. </p>


<p>and interviews are videotaped and conducted by a multidisciplinary team. Cases may be 
referred to criminal or civil authorities and/or to public health services. The establishment 
of the Office has drastically reduced delays in the consideration of these cases.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Civil society and community-based mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>70. Civil society and community-based organizations, including NGOs, professional 
associations, religious groups, foundations and the private sector, often play a pivotal role 
in helping children access counselling and complaints systems, and in developing effective 
mechanisms for reporting violence against children.  
</p>
<p>71. For example, the Philippine Mental Health Association is a professional association 
with a significant role in assisting child victims of violence, and in prevention and 
awareness-raising. Through the Youth Life Enrichment Program it organizes workshops to 
teach life skills to young people, leading to the establishment of over 90 mental-health 
clubs in secondary schools throughout the country, whose members are trained in peer 
counselling.46 
</p>
<p>72. In Ethiopia, the African Network for the Prevention and Protection against Child 
Abuse and Neglect provides counselling and support to children in police stations.47 In 
Chad, student committees and parent-teacher associations participate in the identification 
and response to child protection concerns. In case of repeated child absence from school or 
signs of abuse or neglect, home visits are promoted to monitor the child&#8217;s situation. Such 
committees facilitate the identification of children at risk, who can then be referred to 
appropriate actors. 
</p>
<p>73. The Dar el Aman (&#8220;house of security&#8221;) child protection centre in Jordan provides 
therapy and protection to children who have experienced physical, sexual and/or 
psychological abuse. Some are referred by courts and others seek help through a hotline. 
Similar centres have been established in other countries in the region.48 
</p>
<p>74. In Pakistan, Lawyers for Human Rights and Legal Aid established a centre 
(Madadgaar) that provides shelter, medical and psychological counselling and legal 
services to child victims of violence. The Society for the Protection of the Rights of the 
Child established Child Rights Committees at the district level, staffed by professional 
social workers who provide counselling and assist victims to make complaints to the 
competent authorities. The Pakistan Pediatric Association, together with Pakistani NGOs, 
participates in the implementation of the National Plan of Action against Child Sexual 
Abuse and Exploitation.  
</p>
<p>75. An inter-agency study was undertaken regarding global evidence on community-
based child-protection groups and their impact. It found that community-based child-
protection groups played a role in raising awareness about risks to children&#8217;s protection and 
well-being; in mobilizing communities to respond to and prevent those risks, helping to 
develop local solutions to problems and referring difficult cases; and in organizing 
psychosocial support for children. Illustrating the importance of partnership with public 
services, most groups networked with elements in the formal child protection system, such

<p>as police, magistrates, district- and national-level committees, and social services and 
education officials. Many also networked with elements in non-formal systems, such as 
traditional justice mechanisms.49 
</p>
<p>76. Lessons identified in other studies include the need to secure the sustainability of 
these efforts by encouraging community &#8220;ownership&#8221;, and to avoid interventions that may 
inadvertently stigmatize victims. Cooperation between community-based organizations and 
governmental agencies, in the form of training, clear definition of roles, coaching, case 
review and monitoring, can help reduce the risk of inappropriate interventions. Community-
based organizations can help monitor complaint mechanisms, to ensure that they are child-
sensitive and effective. The participation of children themselves can help ensure that 
services, in particular outreach to make victims aware of complaints mechanisms and 
services, are more effective.50 
</p>
<p>77. The cooperation of civil society with government can take many forms. One 
important lesson is that community-based child protection groups should act in association 
with the national child protection system where it exists, rather than become a parallel 
structure. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Child helplines 
</b></p>
<p>78. Dedicated telephone numbers that can be called anonymously and at no cost to seek 
advice about incidents of violence have been established in many countries throughout the 
world. Helplines can be used by victims, by other persons who know of or suspect violence, 
and even by persons who commit violence and wish to seek help.  
</p>
<p>79. Some are specialized in specific types of violence (for example sexual violence, 
domestic violence, or all violence against children), while others deal with a wide range of 
concerns. Some are provided by NGOs and others by governmental agencies.51 
</p>
<p>80. Some helplines convey information and advice about where to turn and what the 
authorities can do. Others provide informal emergency psychological support. Still others 
can forward information transmitted by the caller to those responsible for taking action.  
</p>
<p>81. Services are starting to use new technologies, such as the Internet or text messages 
(SMS). In Switzerland, for example, each day some 400 children are given advice by SMS 
and some 1,000 receive on-line advice.52 In 2010, Austria, Germany and Switzerland 
opened an Internet service allowing the public to report suspected cases of sexual 
exploitation of children in tourism.53 Canada has a website for reporting Internet child 
pornography.54 
</p>
<p>82. According to Child Helpline International, representing helplines from over 100 
countries, violence is one of the main reasons for which children contact helplines. In its 
2010 International Report on Violence against Children, the organization recorded more

<p>than 250,000 incidents of violence and abuse amongst the 62 helplines contributing to its 
survey. Most reports concerned children aged 10-15 years old, in particular girls. Physical 
abuse and bullying are most reported on, followed by neglect, sexual abuse and emotional 
violence. 
</p>
<p>83. The authors of the present report recognize that while the primary responsibility for 
child protection lies with national Governments, child helplines represent a unique 
opportunity to support government action. These should be identified as a core component 
of comprehensive, robust and integrated national child protection systems, as a much 
needed resource for children, as a generator of data and information, and also as a referral 
system for children in need of advice and assistance.  
</p>
<p><b> 7. Reaching the most vulnerable 
</b></p>
<p>84. An important area for partnership between civil society and governments concerns 
the provision of safe mechanisms for particularly vulnerable children, who are often hard to 
reach through government services. Marginalized children include those lacking parental 
care, those placed in institutional settings or in detention, those living and working in the 
streets, those with disabilities, those in extreme poverty, those trapped in child labour, or 
those on the move, including as migrants or asylum-seekers, as well as children in 
situations of armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>85. Incidents of violence, including sexual violence, are exacerbated in conflict 
situations by a general security vacuum and the lack of administrative, law-enforcement 
and judicial infrastructures, among other factors. As noted by the Special Representative on 
Sexual Violence in Conflict, &#8220;sexual violence in conflict is a political, security and human 
rights issue that demands a political, security and human rights response&#8221;.55  
</p>
<p>86. Rape and other sexual violence against children are under scrutiny by the Security 
Council monitoring and reporting mechanism on children and armed conflict. According to 
reports of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed 
Conflict, children are particularly vulnerable to sexual violence in and around refugee and 
internally displaced population settings, and when associated with armed forces and 
groups.56 Girls remain the main victims of sexual violence in armed conflict, but there are 
increasing reports of sexual abuse against boys. Collecting data and reporting on sexual 
violence against children in armed conflict remains a significant challenge. As noted by the 
Special Representative: &#8220;these acts are considered in many contexts as strong taboos, and as 
such survivors and communities are not encouraged to speak out. The lack of trust in the 
judicial process and the fear of reprisals accentuate the culture of silence.&#8221;57 
</p>
<p>87. Children in extreme poverty may not only be hard to reach due to geographic 
remoteness or social exclusion, but also often suffer from a deep lack of self-esteem. 
Victims of bullying, humiliation and abuse, they feel powerless to speak up, and fear not 
being believed when reporting incidents of violence, or being blamed for having caused 
them in the first place. 
</p>
<p>88. Once in the streets, children become highly vulnerable to violence and exploitation. 
Many have run away due to psychological, physical or sexual abuse suffered in the home, 
while others have remained in contact with their families and work in the streets in order to 
supplement the family income.  
</p>

<p>89. The placement of children in institutions remains high in many countries. 
Institutions are often not registered, norms and standards regulating their activities are 
frequently lacking, and monitoring systems remain weak and dispersed. These cumulative 
factors compromise children&#8217;s access to safe complaint and reporting mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>90. Research data is limited, but some evidence indicates that children with disabilities 
may be up to five times more likely to experience physical, psychological, or sexual 
violence,58 less likely to be addressed by prevention programmes or to attract targeted 
protection services, and less able to challenge or protect themselves from incidents of 
violence. This explains, inter alia, the special barriers in accessing justice and being 
accepted as credible witnesses, and the pervasive impunity of abusers. The universal 
ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities will be an essential 
step to secure the protection of these children from violence.  
</p>
<p>91. Children on the move,<b> </b>including children who migrate, who are refugees or asylum-
seekers are also at special risk of enduring violence without benefiting from counselling or 
having access to reporting or complaint mechanisms. According to the World Bank, 
approximately one third of migrants from developing countries are between the ages of 12 
and 24.59 At times on their own, unable to speak the language and lacking information 
about existing child protection services, they are often afraid of approaching the authorities 
and of being deported, especially when undocumented. As a result, they may place 
themselves at further risk of violence and exploitation.  
</p>
<p>92. The authors of the present report recognize the urgency of rendering counselling, 
reporting and complaint mechanisms accessible, effective and sensitive to vulnerable 
children and their families. Thus, cooperation with non-governmental and community-
based organizations may offer a solid basis for effective action.  
</p>
<p><b> C. The role of national independent human rights institutions for children 
</b></p>
<p>93. National independent human rights institutions for children play a critical role in the 
promotion and protection of children&#8217;s freedom from violence. The Committee on the 
Rights of the Child consistently recommends the establishment of these institutions, 
including powers to consider individual complaints and carry out investigations, and secure 
effective remedies for breaches of children&#8217;s rights.<footnote name="6">6 General Comment 12, CRC/L/GC/12. 
 67 General Comment 13 adopted in February 2011. </footnote>0 
</p>
<p>94. There are some 122 statutory national human rights commissions throughout the 
world, some with a distinct mandate on the rights of the child.61 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Mandate  
</b></p>
<p>95. Independent human rights institutions for children (IHRICs) have a comprehensive 
child rights mandate, conducting research and awareness-raising campaigns, promoting law 
and policy reforms, and assisting child victims. Those with a mandate to receive individual 
complaints address violence against children committed by professionals working with 
children, including teachers, staff of children&#8217;s homes, police officers and other public 
servants. These mechanisms are non-adversarial, based on dialogue and mediation, and 
seek to find negotiated solutions guided by the child&#8217;s best interests. Currently, only some

<p>IHRICs have the power to consider individual complaints and petitions and carry out 
investigations, including those submitted on behalf of or directly by children.  
</p>
<p>96. Several IHRICs can take cases to court or alert the prosecutor, in particular when a 
child is in danger and an urgent judicial decision is needed. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Accessibility 
</b></p>
<p>97. Compared with the judicial system, IHRICs are generally more accessible as their 
complaint system is free of charge, does not require a lawyer, and is less formal and simpler 
to use. Accessibility is enhanced through local offices for the identification and 
transmission of cases. Some IHRICs proactively reach out to children, including by visiting 
schools, detention and care centres and other places where children spend time, including in 
remote areas. Most IHRICs can carry out investigations on their own initiative. 
Confidentiality is a critical element of this process. 
</p>
<p>98. To ensure child-sensitive approaches and easily communicate with children, IHRICs 
promote child-friendly premises, in-service training and the use of new technologies, 
including websites and social media. Some offices have complaint forms online and host 
online forums for children. 
</p>
<p>99. Involving children in the work of these institutions has led to major breakthroughs. 
In some cases, a &#8220;Youth Advisory Panel&#8221;62 or elected student representatives63 help 
familiarize their peers and classmates with their work and make complaints procedures 
more accessible. 
</p>
<p>100. In some instances, the law provides that the IHRIC can only handle a complaint filed 
by a child once permission from a parent or legal guardian is granted.64 However, in cases 
where parents or legal guardians may be the source of abuse, children are allowed to choose 
an adult they trust. In other countries, the child&#8217;s permission needs to be sought to pursue a 
complaint filed on his or her behalf. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Effectiveness 
</b></p>

<p><b> III. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>Important international and regional human rights standards provide a sound 
framework for the development of strong, safe and effective counselling, reporting 
and complaint mechanisms to address incidents of violence against children. As 
agreed upon at the Third World Congress against Sexual Exploitation of Children 
and Adolescents, these mechanisms should be set up in all countries by 2013.  
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>At the national level, significant efforts have been undertaken, both by 
Governments, which have the leading responsibility for child protection, and by other 
key stakeholders, including independent human rights institutions for children, civil 
society and community-based organizations. Yet, these efforts remain fragmented and 
insufficient to secure children&#8217;s protection from violence. Urgent steps are needed to 
establish and strengthen these mechanisms in conformity with relevant international 
human rights instruments and political commitments undertaken by States in this 
area. These measures are critical to develop robust child protection systems in which 
violence is effectively addressed, and children&#8217;s dignity and fundamental rights are 
respected.  
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>As confirmed by the analysis conducted for the present report, too often, 
available mechanisms lack a basis in law and have no clear definition of their 
mandate, role and responsibilities. National plans of action on children, or specifically 
on violence against children, address these mechanisms in a sporadic manner and lack 
the necessary resources to ensure their timely and effective intervention. Evaluation of 
these mechanisms is rare, and so is the assessment of the effectiveness of follow-up 
measures, or of the impact on children of decisions taken in response to violence. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Guiding principles 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>It is urgent to develop effective, child-sensitive counselling, reporting and 
complaint mechanisms, universally available to and accessible by all children, without 
discrimination of any kind.  
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>These mechanisms are a core component of the national child protection 
system, and should be anchored in child-rights laws and policies, supported by 
integrated services for children, and pursued with initiatives to change social norms, 
attitudes, behaviours and practices that condone violence. It is critical to address the 
root causes of tolerance of violence against children, reasons for underreporting, and 
barriers for accessing available services. 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>Children need to feel empowered, to obtain the required information about 
their rights to access and to make effective use of these mechanisms; they need to feel 
reassured that they will be listened to in an ethical, safe and confidential manner, that 
their testimonies will not be disclosed or misused, and that their protection will not be 
put at risk. Children&#8217;s participation in these efforts should be secured, including in 
the design and development of these mechanisms.  
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>Counselling, complaint and reporting mechanisms should, at a minimum: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Be established by law and in conformity with international human rights</b> 
<b>instruments, with clearly defined roles and responsibilities for governmental 
departments, and well-defined standards for the actions of other institutions, services 
and facilities responsible for the care or protection of children; </b></p>


<p><b> (b) Be made widely available and well-publicized through appropriate and 
active means to children and adults, including those acting on children&#8217;s behalf; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Be accessible to all children under the jurisdiction of the State, without 
discrimination of any kind, while being age appropriate and gender sensitive, and 
granting special protection to children at risk; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Be guided by the best interests of the child and informed by children&#8217;s 
experience and perspectives; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Guarantee the safety of children, through, inter alia, measures to avoid 
any risk of harm, intimidation, reprisals or revictimization; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Ensure the confidentiality of proceedings and respect children&#8217;s right to 
privacy; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Provide prompt and speedy response and follow-up, to, inter alia, avoid 
adverse consequences to those concerned. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>Where mechanisms do not exist,</b> <b>States should establish by law, and promote 
and implement safe, child-sensitive counselling, complaint and reporting mechanisms 
in compliance with the guiding principles and requirements mentioned above, as a 
core dimension of a well-functioning and well-resourced national child protection 
system, which is universally available to and accessible by all children without 
discrimination of any kind. Such mechanisms should be grounded in a solid legal 
framework framed by international standards, prohibiting all forms of violence 
against children, and safeguarding the rights of child victims and witnesses, and 
should be provided with the necessary financial means and well-trained human 
resources to act in a timely, ethical, child-sensitive and effective manner.  
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>Where mechanisms exist, it is critical to secure their availability to and 
accessibility by all children, without discrimination, and to ensure that they act in an 
ethical, effective and child-sensitive manner and pursue the best interests of the child 
at all times. To this end: 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a) Laws, policies and guidelines should be developed in conformity with 
international human rights standards, and clearly define the roles and responsibilities 
of relevant bodies, institutions and professionals involved with counselling, reporting 
and complaint services for children affected by violence; the rights and legal 
safeguards of child victims and witnesses should be clearly spelled out, including with 
a view to avoiding any risk of revictimization through harassment or reprisals. Those 
working with children should have clear guidance on reporting requirements and 
consequences. Mandatory reporting responsibilities should be defined with respect for 
children&#8217;s rights, including to confidentiality and privacy; standards establishing an 
obligation to report violence should be incorporated into regulations or rules of 
conduct of all institutions and agencies that deal with children at risk of violence. 
Mandatory reporting by professionals who work with children of sexual abuse and 
other acts of violence causing physical injury and psychological violence should be 
given due consideration by all countries. Rules that protect the identity of 
professionals and private individuals who bring cases of violence against children to 
the attention of the competent authorities should also be enacted into law;  
</b></p>
<p> <b>(b)</b> <b>An institutional, coordinated and integrated response should be pursued 
across relevant sectors, including justice, law enforcement, social welfare, education 
and health. This effort should be supported by: (i) initiatives to enhance staff capacity </b></p>


<p><b>in child-sensitive case management; (ii) putting in place an effective system of referral 
of complaints to appropriate authorities, with obligations to investigate where a child 
may be at risk, and enabling relevant authorities to intervene to protect children in 
danger; and (iii) child-sensitive judicial proceedings; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(c)</b> <b>National human rights institutions should be established in all countries 
by 2013 to safeguard children&#8217;s freedom from violence; they should provide for, inter 
alia, child-sensitive counselling, reporting and complaint mechanisms; independent 
monitoring of measures to address violence; and effective remedies and redress, 
including the possibility of seeking advice and filing complaints before these 
institutions; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(d)</b> <b>Capacity-building and training initiatives should be developed to ensure 
that those working with and for children have the necessary knowledge and skills, and 
abide by child rights principles and ethical standards when providing children with 
counselling when interviewing or supporting them in reporting and complaint 
proceedings or in relevant recovery and reintegration programmes. These efforts 
should promote a collaborative and integrated approach among relevant 
professionals, including in the medical, legal, social and educational areas. Where not 
available, mental health systems for children and adolescents should be developed; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(e)</b> <b>Awareness-raising efforts should be promoted to inform children and 
their families about children&#8217;s rights, and information on effective remedies to 
address incidents of violence and on available services for assistance and support 
should be well publicized. Information should be made available on where to benefit 
from confidential advice, and on how and where to report incidents and lodge 
complaints. Information and services that are age- and language-appropriate and 
gender- and disability-sensitive should be put in place to enable access and ensure 
support to all children without discrimination of any kind;  
</b></p>
<p> <b>(f)</b> <b>Safety and confidentiality should be safeguarded to protect children and 
their representatives from any risk of reprisal when complaints are lodged or 
incidents of violence reported, and to ensure that all actions are carried out in the best 
interest of the child and with children&#8217;s involvement and informed consent. Children 
must be confident that no information will be shared without their consent and their 
confidentiality will not be breached, unless there is a well-founded belief that doing so 
would be necessary to protect them or others from serious harm; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(g)</b> <b>Access by children and those acting on their behalf to international and 
regional mechanisms should be supported when domestic legal remedies fail to protect 
children; the drafting of the new optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child on the establishment of a communications procedure provides an essential 
avenue for addressing incidents of violence through safe and child-sensitive 
proceedings; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(h)</b> <b>Data and research should be strengthened to overcome the invisibility of 
violence and the persistent lack of information on the outcome of violence-related 
cases and to evaluate the impact of relevant initiatives on the children concerned. 
Children&#8217;s views and experience should inform this process; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(i)</b> <b>Monitoring and evaluation should be strengthened, including for 
ensuring respect for high professional and ethical standards, and enhancing the 
effectiveness and positive impact of those mechanisms. With this aim, confidential exit 
interviews should allow to collect views and comments of children who have used 
these mechanisms. Hearing these views and responding to them in the development of 
mechanisms and services is an essential way to move towards greater child sensitivity. </b></p>


<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Overview of international and regional standards and 
commitments concerning child-sensitive counselling, 
reporting and complaint mechanisms to address incidents of 
violence against children, including sexual violence and 
exploitation 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. International standards 
</b></p>

<p>or risk of violence should, at a minimum, be required by professionals working directly 
with children. When reports are made in good faith, processes must be in place to ensure 
the protection of the professional making the report.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>5. Previously, the Committee had highlighted that68 states need to ensure that there are 
effective, child sensitive procedures available to children and their representatives, 
including the provision of child friendly information, advice, advocacy and access to 
independent complaints procedures and to the courts with the appropriate legal and other 
assistance; and national human rights independent institutions should ensure that children 
have effective remedies for the breaches of their rights, including independent advice, 
advocacy and complaints procedures69. 
</p>
<p>6. Where rights are found to have been breached, there should be appropriate 
reparation, including compensation and, where needed, measures to promote physical and 
psychological recovery, rehabilitation and reintegration.  
</p>
<p>7. When incidents of violence take place, the Convention calls for &#8220;the establishment 
of social programmes to provide necessary support for the child and for those who have the 
care of the child, as well as for other forms of prevention and for identification, reporting, 
referral, investigation, treatment and follow-up of instances of child maltreatment described 
heretofore, and, as appropriate, for judicial involvement70&#8221;. The Convention further calls 
for measures designed to &#8220;promote physical and psychological recovery and social 
reintegration of a child victim of any form of neglect, exploitation, or abuse; torture or any 
other form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; or armed conflicts71.&#8221; 
&#8220;Such recovery and reintegration&#8221;, it adds, &#8220;shall take place in an environment which 
fosters the health, self-respect and dignity of the child.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>8. <b>The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale 
of children, child prostitution and child pornography</b>, in force in 142 States72, requires 
States Parties to adapt legal and investigative procedures to the special needs of child 
victims, including their needs as witnesses, to provide support services, inform them of 
their rights, their role and the scope, timing and progress of the proceedings, avoid 
unnecessary delay, allow their views, needs and concerns to be presented and considered, 
protect their privacy and protect them against intimidation and retaliation.73 It also 
underscores that the best interest of the child shall be a primary consideration in the 
treatment of victims in the criminal justice system, and that the persons who work with 
victims shall receive appropriate training.74 
</p>
<p>9. Article 6 of the <b>Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
on the involvement of children in armed conflict</b> provides that each State Party shall take 
all necessary legal, administrative and other measures to ensure the effective 
implementation and enforcement of the protocol. 
</p>
<p>10. International criminal law also establishes important safeguards in this field. Indeed, 
according to the Rome Statute, the <b>International Criminal Court</b> is required to take 
appropriate measures to protect the safety, physical and psychological well-being, dignity 
and privacy of victims and witnesses; and, to secure their protection, it may conduct 
</p>

<p>proceedings in camera or allow the presentation of evidence by electronic or other special 
means; &#8220;these measures shall be implemented in the case of a victim of sexual violence or a 
child who is a victim or a witness75&#8221;. The Rome Statute also foresees the establishment of a 
Victims and Witnesses Unit within the Registry to provide protective measures and security 
arrangements, counselling and other appropriate assistance. The Unit &#8220;shall include staff 
with expertise in trauma, including trauma related to crimes of sexual violence76&#8221;.77 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Regional standards 
</b></p>
<p>11. Significant regional instruments also address this area of concern. The Inter-
American<b> Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence 
against Women</b>, also covering the situation of girls under the age of majority78, calls for 
fair and effective legal procedures for victims including &#8220;protective measures, a timely 
hearing and effective access to such procedures&#8221; (&#8230;) &#8220;effective access to restitution, 
reparations or other just and effective remedies&#8221;, and specialized services, including 
shelters [and] counselling services&#8230;&#8221;.79The Convention applies to physical, sexual and 
psychological violence, although not to violence against boys, and is in force in all OAS 
Member States except two.80 
</p>
<p>12. <b>The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child</b> mirrors many of the 
protective principles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, including the need for 
legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all 
forms of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment, from physical or mental injury or abuse, 
neglect or maltreatment including sexual abuse; and from sexual exploitation. Protective 
measures include the establishment of special monitoring units to provide necessary support 
for the child and for those who have the care of the child, as well as other forms of 
prevention and for identification, reporting referral investigation, treatment, and follow-up 
of instances of child abuse and neglect.  
</p>
<p>13. <b>The Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights on the 
Rights of Women in Africa</b> presents important provisions for the protection of girls from 
violence and calls, inter alia, for the establishment of mechanisms and accessible services 
for effective information, rehabilitation and reparation of victims of violence; for States&#8217; 
support to initiatives directed at providing women with access to legal services, including 
legal aid; and requires the provision of appropriate remedies to be &#8220;determined by 
competent judicial, administrative or legislative authorities, or any other competent 
authority provided for by law81&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>14. <b>The Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and 
Sexual Abuse </b>adopted by the Council of Europe in 2007 requires Parties to take &#8220;measures 
to assist victims, in the short and long term, in their physical and psychosocial recovery&#8221;82 
and to &#8220;adopt a protective approach towards victims, ensuring that the investigations and 
criminal proceedings do not aggravate the trauma experienced by the child and that the

 81 See in particular articles 1 j), 8 and 25 
 82 Art. 14(1) </p>


<p>criminal justice response is followed by assistance, where appropriate83&#8221;. Article 31 
establishes a comprehensive set of safeguards for the protection of the rights of victims and 
witnesses, including on their safety, protection from intimidation and re-victimization, 
rehabilitation, and the provision of age-sensitive information. Article 35 contains standards 
regarding interviews with child victims, which should take place without unjustified delay, 
by professionals trained for this purpose and conducted in an environment and in manner 
sensitive to the rights and vulnerability of the child84. This Convention also indicates that 
norms concerning the confidentiality of information obtained in the course of professional 
activities should not prevent their reporting of situations where they have reasonable 
grounds for believing that the child is a victim of sexual abuse or exploitation and it 
encourages the establishment of telephone or internet helplines to provide confidential 
advice.85 At present, it is in force for 10 of the 47 Member States of the Council of Europe, 
and is also opened to the accession by non-member States.86 
</p>
<p>15. The 2005 <b>Economic and Social Council Guidelines on Justice in Matters 
involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime </b>(&#8220;UN Guidelines&#8221;), provide a 
comprehensive set of standards of strong relevance for the protection of children affected 
by violence. Sections V to XIV contain significant guidance on the right to be treated with 
dignity and compassion; to be protected from discrimination; to be informed, to be heard 
and to express views and concerns; the right to effective assistance, to privacy, to be 
protected from hardship during the justice process; the right to safety, to reparation and to 
special preventive measures. 
</p>
<p>16. At the regional level, the <b>Council of Europe Guidelines on Child Friendly 
Justice</b>87, adopted in November 2010, recognize the right to a speedy, age sensitive, 
diligent justice system that respects children&#8217;s rights and children&#8217;s protection from harm, 
intimidation, reprisals and secondary victimization; the Guidelines also highlight the right 
to &#8220;appropriate ways to access justice&#8221; and to &#8220;appropriate independent and effective 
complaints mechanisms.&#8221;88 
</p>
<p><b> 3. International commitments to children 
</b></p>
<p>17. The participants at the <b>World Congress III against Sexual Exploitation of 
Children and Adolescents</b> agreed upon important commitments in this area, having called 
on States to: 
</p>
<p> (a) establish by 2013 an effective and accessible system for reporting, follow up 
and support for child victims of suspected or actual incidents of sexual exploitation, for 
example by instituting mandatory reporting for people in positions of responsibility for the 
welfare of children; 
</p>
<p> (b) develop or enhance accessibility of existing telephone or web-based help 
lines, in particular for children in care and justice institutions, to encourage children and 
require care givers to confidentially report sexual exploitation and seek referral to 
appropriate services, and ensure that the operators of such reporting mechanisms are 
adequately trained and supervised;

<p> (c) establish or strengthen national child protection services in order to provide 
all child victims of sexual exploitation, without discrimination, with the necessary 
economic and psychosocial support for their full physical and psychological recovery and 
social reintegration; 
</p>
<p> (d) ensure that these services are accessible, appropriately resourced, 
comprehensive, child- and gender-sensitive, and reach all children without discrimination 
of any kind, irrespective of the child&#8217;s or his or her parent&#8217;s or legal guardian&#8217;s race, colour, 
sex, and social origin and including children with disabilities, from ethnic minorities, 
indigenous or Aboriginal children, refugee or asylum-seeking and children in domestic

<p>18. The establishment of violence related child sensitive mechanisms is gaining an 
increasing relevance as part of the process of follow-up to the UN Study on Violence 
against Children across regions. In the case of South Asia, for instance, governments in the 
region formed the <b>South Asia Initiative to Eliminate Violence against Children</b> 
(SAIEVAC) which adopted a strategic plan for 2010-15 with two specific goals addressing 
this question: 
</p>
<p> (a) By 2015 all States have ensured that all professionals working with or for 
children (including those working for the State) who suspect that acts of violence have been 
committed against a child are required by law to report the crime (&#8230;) Reporting systems 
should be safe, well publicized, confidential, accessible and child friendly, allowing 
children, their representatives and others to report violence against children. 
</p>
<p> (b) By 2015 all States have clearly defined procedures for the referral of child 
victims of violence and the modalities for inter-agency cooperation (that is between social 
services, education, health, police, prosecution authorities, voluntary and private agencies) 
following an assessment of each particular victim, given due weight to his/her views, and 
when it is in the best interests of the child, also to her/his parents&#8217; or guardians&#8217; views.
