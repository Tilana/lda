BAIL RULING
______________________________________________________________________________

1.      
The Applicant is been charged with one count of Rape contrary to section 207 (1) and (2) (b) and (3) of the Crimes Decree 2009 in the High Court of Suva in Criminal Case No. HAC 078/2013.

2.      
The Applicant applies for Bail pending Trial on the following grounds:

(i)     
Looking after his sickly and elderly parents.

(ii)    
Supporting his siblings who are still schooling.

(iii)   
Taking care of the family farm in Veikoba to support the family.

3.      
The counsel appeared on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) informed court that the State has no objection to release the Accused on Bail on strict conditions.

4.      
As it was revealed in court, the alleged victim in this instance is a small girl of 3 years old while the accused is 33 years of age. 

5.      
Prosecution admits that there is no relationship between the Accused and the victim. Thus, the background does not attract the provisions of the Domestic Violence Decree.

6.      
Further, it is noted that the Trial of the substantive matter (HAC 78/2013) is been scheduled from 15th  18th July 2014 and not in July 2013 as stated by the Learned Prosecutor.

The Applicant should:

(i)     
Sign a Bail Bond of $1000.
