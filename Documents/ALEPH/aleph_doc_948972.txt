FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 
Suncor Energy reports oil sands production numbers for December 2009 
 
Calgary, Alberta (January 7, 2010) – Suncor Energy Inc. reported today that the company’s oil sands 
production during December averaged approximately 219,000 barrels per day (bpd). Production for the 
month was reduced due to unplanned maintenance activities following a December 15 fire at one of the 
two upgraders. The company achieved its production target with annual oil sands production during 
2009 averaging approximately 291,000 bpd.  
 
Production numbers include upgraded sweet and sour synthetic crude oil and diesel, as well as non-
upgraded bitumen sold directly to the market, from all Suncor-operated facilities. Reported volumes do 
not include Suncor’s proportionate production share from the Syncrude joint venture. 
 
On a monthly basis, Suncor reports production numbers from its oil sands operation in order to provide 
stakeholders with a more timely review of operational performance. These numbers are preliminary and 
subject to adjustment. Monthly totals may differ from year-to-date total due to rounding, the impact of 
sales and changes in inventory. Fourth quarter and full-year 2009 production volumes will be confirmed 
when Suncor's fourth quarter results are released.  
 
This news release contains forward-looking statements, including an outlook production range of 290,000 to 
305,000 bdp which are based on Suncor's current expectations, estimates, projections and assumptions and are 
subject to change. Assumptions are based on management's experience and perception of historical trends, 
current conditions, anticipated future developments and other factors related to Suncor's business. Assumptions 
of the 2009 outlook include implementing reliability and operational efficiency initiatives which we expect to 
minimize unplanned maintenance in 2009. Readers are cautioned that actual results could differ materially from 
those expressed or implied as a result of changes to Suncor's plans and the impact of events, risks and 
uncertainties discussed in Suncor's third quarter earnings release, current annual information form/form 40-F, 
annual report to shareholders and other documents filed with Canadian securities commissions at 
www.sedar.com and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at www.sec.gov.
