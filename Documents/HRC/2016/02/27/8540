<p><b>  Report of the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights on the question of human 
rights in Cyprus  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Note by the Secretary-General 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> The present report has been prepared in accordance with the mandate contained in 
resolution 4 (XXXI) of the Commission on Human Rights (1975). Moreover, at its forty-
third session in 1987, the Commission on Human Rights adopted resolution 1987/50 
entitled Question of human rights in Cyprus, which, inter alia, reiterated its previous calls 
for the full restoration of all human rights to the population of Cyprus, in particular to 
refugees; called for the tracing of and accounting for missing persons in Cyprus without 
any further delay; and called for the restoration and respect of the human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of all Cypriots, including freedom of movement, the freedom of 
settlement and the right to property. It is in this light that this report reflects a variety of 
human rights-related issues. 
</p>
<p> In its decision 2/102, the Human Rights Council requested the Secretary-General 
and the High Commissioner for Human Rights to &#8220;continue with the fulfilment of their 
activities, in accordance with all previous decisions adopted by the Commission on Human 
Rights and to update the relevant reports and studies&#8221;. The Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) understands decision 2/102 to preserve the 
previous annual reporting cycle in respect of this issue until otherwise decided by the 
Council. The last annual report on the question of human rights in Cyprus was submitted to 
the Council at its thirteenth session in March 2010 (A/HRC/13/24). 
</p>
<p> The annex to this note, prepared by OHCHR and covering the period up to 30 
November 2010, is herewith transmitted to the Council. It provides an overview of human 
rights issues in Cyprus based on the available information. For the purpose of this report, in 
the absence of an OHCHR field presence in Cyprus, or of any specific monitoring 
mechanism, OHCHR has relied on a variety of sources with particular knowledge of the 
human rights situation on the island.

<p><b> I. Overview 
</b></p>
<p>1. As of November 2010, Cyprus remains divided, with a buffer zone maintained by 
the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP). The UNFICYP mandate, 
which dates back to 1964, has been extended by successive Security Council resolutions. In 
resolution 1930 (2010) of 15 June 2010, the Security Council decided to extend the 
mandate for a further period ending 15 December 2010.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>2. UNFICYP has continued to provide humanitarian assistance to the communities, 
including to Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in the north and Turkish Cypriots living 
in the south of the island. Assistance continued to be sought from the mission in addressing 
day-to-day issues arising from the division of the island, including in relation to economic, 
social and educational matters, the transfer of the deceased, and commemorative, religious 
and socio-cultural gatherings1. 
</p>
<p>3. UNFICYP has also continued to assist in maintaining good relations and building 
trust between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities, including in the mixed 
village of Pyla in the buffer zone2. In order to support reconciliation between the two 
communities, UNFICYP facilitated more than 100 bi-communal events with the 
participation of more than 5,000 people in the period from May to November 20103. 
</p>
<p>4. The process of full-fledged negotiations between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish 
Cypriot sides, aimed at finding a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem, was 
formally launched under United Nations auspices on 3 September 2008. In July 2008, the 
Secretary-General appointed his Special Advisor on Cyprus with the mandate to assist the 
parties in the conduct of the negotiations. The talks between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish 
Cypriot leaders have continued at a steady pace, focusing on various chapters including 
governance and power-sharing, European Union-related matters, and economic matters. 
More recently, the talks have also tackled the chapter on property4.  
</p>
<p>5. Meetings between the representatives of the two leaders and technical meetings at 
the expert level have also taken place. To date, six out of 23 confidence-building measures 
formulated by the technical committees to ensure a conducive atmosphere for a settlement 
by improving the daily lives of Cypriots have been implemented, including the 
establishment of a joint communication room for the exchange of information on crime and 
criminal matters, the facilitation of ambulances through crossing points, and the 
implementation of a project to establish an inventory of immovable cultural heritage in 
Cyprus5. UNFICYP has provided assistance in implementing these confidence-building 
measures6. 
</p>
<p>6. On 18 April 2010, in elections held in the northern part of Cyprus, the Turkish 
Cypriots elected Dervi&#351; Ero&#287;lu as their leader, replacing Mehmet Ali Talat. Following the 
elections, Greek Cypriot leader Demetris Christofias and new Turkish Cypriot leader

<p>Ero&#287;lu wrote to the Secretary-General, affirming their commitment to continuing with the 
negotiations7. 
</p>
<p>7. Talks between the two leaders resumed on 26 May 2010, focusing on the chapter on 
property. In early September, both sides presented their respective comprehensive 
proposals on property, which were discussed at length in subsequent meetings. On 18 
November 2010, the two leaders met with the Secretary-General and reviewed progress 
made in all the chapters of the negotiations. They agreed to continue the discussions on a 
number of core issues identified by the Secretary-General and to report back to him on 
progress made at the end of January8.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Human rights concerns  
</b></p>
<p>8. The persisting division of Cyprus continues to have consequences in relation to a 
number of human rights issues on the whole island, including freedom of movement, 
human rights pertaining to the question of missing persons, discrimination, the right to life, 
freedom of religion and economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Freedom of movement 
</b></p>
<p>9. Crossings between the north and the south of the island are still possible only through 
official crossing points, which limits freedom of movement. In addition, Turkish Cypriot 
authorities impose restrictions on the length of stay by Greek Cypriots in the north. For a 
stay that exceeds three months, they need to apply for a &#8220;visa&#8221;9. 
</p>
<p>10. As agreed between the leaders at the beginning of the negotiations, a seventh 
crossing point through the buffer zone in the north-west of the island, linking the villages of 
Limnitis/Ye&#351;ilirmak in the north and Kato Pyrgos in the south, was opened on 14 October 
</p><p>2010. This significantly reduces travel time across the region and allows for a more direct 
route for travellers to Nicosia. The opening of this crossing point also serves as an 
important confidence building measure to foster an environment conducive to the overall 
negotiations10. 
</p>
<p>11. UNFICYP recorded more than 1.5 million official crossings through the buffer zone 
in the year between 21 November 2009 and 20 November 2010. Between 21 May and 20 
November 2010, more than 10,000 crossings occurred at the newly opened 
Limnitis/Ye&#351;ilirmak crossing point11. 
</p>
<p>12. The requests made by 11 Greek Cypriot and 44 Maronite internally displaced and 
refugee families wanting to return to, and permanently reside in the north are still pending, 
due to differences between the two sides over the eligibility criteria for permanent return12.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Human rights pertaining to the question of missing persons 
</b></p>
<p>13. The Committee on Missing Persons in Cyprus (CMP) continued the exhumation, 
identification and return of the remains of missing persons. By the end of November 2010, 
the remains of 745 individuals had been exhumed on both sides of the buffer zone by the 
</p>

<p>Committee&#8217;s bi-communal teams of archaeologists; the remains of 407 missing persons had 
undergone examination at the Committee&#8217;s bi-communal anthropological laboratory in the 
United Nations Protected Area in Nicosia; and the remains of 263 individuals had been 
returned to their respective families13.  
</p>
<p>14. The Committee of Ministers&#8217; Deputies of the Council of Europe (CoE CMD), which 
supervises the execution of judgments of the European Court of Human Rights (&#8220;the 
Court&#8221;), fully acknowledged the importance of the activities of the CMP in its March 2010 
decision in the case of <i>Varnava and Others v. Turkey</i> (2009)14. The Ministers&#8217; Deputies 
underlined, however, that notwithstanding the importance of these measures as a first step 
in the investigative process, they do not exhaust the obligation under article 2 (right to life) 
of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). CoE CMD therefore insisted on its 
request that the Turkish authorities inform it of the measures envisaged in the prolongation 
of the CMP&#8217;s work with a view to the effective investigations required by this judgment15. 
</p>
<p>15. In another case concerning the question of missing persons, <i>Cyprus v. Turkey 
</i>(2001)16, CoE CMD at its March session recalled its invitation to the Turkish authorities to 
take concrete measures to ensure access by CMP to all relevant information and places, 
without impeding the confidentiality essential to the implementation of its mandate. While 
CoE CMD took note with satisfaction of the information provided by the Turkish 
authorities on allowing the CMP to access several places situated in military zones, it 
insisted on being informed of the concrete<b> </b>measures envisaged in continuity with the work 
of CMP17.  
</p>
<p>16. The crucial importance of complete access of the CMP to military areas in the 
northern part of Cyprus for the purposes of exhumation was emphasized also by the 
Secretary-General, who in his latest report on the United Nations operation in Cyprus urged 
the Turkish Forces to adopt a more forthcoming approach, given the humanitarian 
dimension of the issue18. 
</p>
<p>17. In its concluding observations on the third periodic report of Turkey, the Committee 
against Torture called on Turkey to take prompt measures to ensure effective, transparent 
and independent investigations into all outstanding cases of alleged disappearances, 
including those cited by the Court and especially referring to <i>Cyprus v. Turkey</i>19.  
</p>
<p>18. On 3 June 2010 the Court delivered a partial decision as to the admissibility of <i>Emin 
and six other cases v. Cyprus, Greece and the United Kingdom</i>, where the applicants, 
relatives of Turkish Cypriot men who went missing in either December 1963 or in April-

 14 In the case of <i>Varnava and Others v. Turkey</i> (16064/90) the Grand Chamber of the Court held that 
</p>
<p>there was a continuing violation of article 2 (right to life), of article 3 (prohibition of inhuman or 
degrading treatment) and of article 5 (right to liberty and security) of the ECHR. 
</p>
<p> 15 Council of Europe Committee of Ministers&#8217; Deputies Decisions adopted at the 1078th meeting, 2-4 
March 2010, on <i>Varnava and Others v. Turkey</i>. 
</p>
<p> 16 In its judgment the Court held that Turkey was responsible for 14 violations of the ECHR, grouped by 
the Committee of Ministers into four categories: (1) the question of missing persons; (2) the living 
conditions of Greek Cypriots in northern Cyprus; (3) the rights of Turkish Cypriots living in northern 
Cyprus; and (4) the question of the homes and property of displaced persons.

</p>
<p>Advance unedited version, para. 9. </p>


<p>May 1964, raised complaints under several articles of the ECHR20. The Court decided to 
adjourn the examinations of the applicants&#8217; complaints against the Republic of Cyprus 
concerning the lack of investigation following the discovery of the remains of their relatives 
between 2006 and 2009 and the trauma and anguish which they suffer as a result21.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Property rights 
</b></p>
<p>19. On 22 April 2010 the Parliament of the Republic of Cyprus passed a law amending 
the Turkish-Cypriot Properties Law, under which the abandoned Turkish Cypriot properties 
in the south are administered by the Minister of Interior (Custodian)22. While previously 
only Turkish Cypriot property owners who lived in the Government-controlled areas or 
moved abroad before 1974 could claim their property, the amendment extends this right 
also to those who went abroad after 197423. It also establishes the actionable right of 
Turkish Cypriot property owners to have recourse to the district courts in case of alleged 
violation of their right guaranteed by the ECHR or its Protocols, but only after their claim 
has been rejected by the Minister of Interior. If the court finds a violation, compensation or 
restitution of property may be granted. In exceptional cases, there is a possibility of lifting 
the custodianship over a particular property 24 . The changes to the Turkish-Cypriot 
Properties Law were announced by the Cyprus Government in its declaration to the 
European Court of Human Rights in the case of <i>Sofi v. Cyprus,</i> which ended with a friendly 
settlement25. 
</p>
<p>20. On 1 March 2010 the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights 
decided as to the admissibility of the application <i>Demopoulos v. Turkey</i> <i>and seven other 
cases</i>26, wherein the applicants claimed to have been deprived of their property rights 
following the 1974 Turkish intervention in northern Cyprus. The Grand Chamber 
concluded that Law 67/2005 of December 2005, according to which all natural and legal 
persons claiming rights to immovable or movable property could bring a claim before the 
Immovable Property Commission (IPC)27, &#8220;provides an accessible and effective framework 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 20 The applicants complained against Cyprus under article 2 (right to life), article 3 (prohibition of 
</p>
<p>torture and inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment), article 8 (right to respect for private and 
family life), article 13 (right to an effective remedy) and article 14 (prohibition of discrimination in 
the enjoyment of Convention rights). <i>Emin and six other cases v. Cyprus, Greece and the United 
Kingdom Decision </i>(59623/08, 3706/09, 16206/09, 25180/09, 32744/09, 36499/09 and 57250/09)<i>, </i>3

</p>
<p>access to and enjoyment of her immovable property in the district of Larnaca, which disclosed a 
continuing violation of article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions), a 
continuing violation of article 8 (right to respect for one&#8217;s home), a violation of article 14 (prohibition 
against discrimination in enjoyment of Convention rights) in that she had been discriminated against 
as a Turkish Cypriot and article 13 (right to an effective remedy). 
</p>
<p> 26 Grand Chamber&#8217;s <i>Demopoulos and Others v. Turkey</i> <i>Decision</i> (46113/92), 1 March 2010. 
 27 The IPC was set up under Law No. 67/2005 for the compensation, exchange and restitution of 
</p>
<p>immovable properties following the Court&#8217;s judgment in the <i>Xenides-Arestis v. Turkey</i> (46347/99) 
case. It officially began its activities on 17 March 2006. As of 30 November 2010, 773 applications 
have been lodged with the IPC (330 in 2010) and 130 of them have been concluded through friendly 
settlements and four through formal hearing. The IPC has paid 49,164,000 pounds sterling to the </p>


<p>of redress in respect of complaints about interference with the property owned by Greek 
Cypriots&#8221;28. As the applicants had not made use of this mechanism, their complaints under 
article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (protection of property) to the ECHR were rejected for non-
exhaustion of domestic remedies29. 
</p>
<p>21. The Court stressed that notwithstanding the fact that the IPC was recognized as a 
domestic remedy for cases involving Greek Cypriot properties in the north, its decision in 
this case was not to be interpreted as an obligation to make use of the IPC; the<b> </b>claimants 
could choose to await a political solution. However, if applicants wished to lodge an 
application before the Court, its admissibility would be decided in line with the present 
principles30. 
</p>
<p>22. The CoE CMD is currently assessing the consequences of the <i>Demopoulos </i>decision 
on the supervision of <i>Loizidou v. Turkey </i>(1996)31 ,<i> Cyprus v. Turkey </i>(2001)<i>,</i> <i>Demades v. 
Turkey </i>(2003) 32, <i>Xenides-Arestis v. Turkey</i> (2006)33 and other individual cases concerning 
property rights of displaced Greek Cypriots34.  
</p>
<p>23. In the <i>Xenides-Arestis v. Turkey</i> case the CoE CMD at its March 2010 session 
adopted an interim resolution strongly urging Turkey to pay without any further delay the 
just satisfaction awarded to the applicant by the Court&#8217;s judgment of 7 December 2006, as 
well as the default interest due35.  
</p>
<p>24. In the reporting period CoE CMD also examined the question of the property rights 
of enclaved persons in relation to the <i>Cyprus v. Turkey</i> case (2001). Following the Turkish 
authorities&#8217; timely submission of the legislative texts and a related decision relevant for the 
examination, the delegation of the Republic of Cyprus on 21 May 2010 provided written 
</p>
<p>                                                                                                                                                                                                 
applicants as compensation. In addition, it has ruled for exchange and compensation in two cases, for 
restitution in one case and for restitution and compensation in five cases. In one case it has delivered a 
decision for restitution after the settlement of the Cyprus problem, and in one case it has ruled for 
partial restitution. Source: IPC, Monthly Bulletin (November 2010), http://www.northcyprusipc.org.

<p> 28 Grand Chamber <i>Demopoulos and others v. Turkey</i> <i>Decision</i> (46113/92), 1 March 2010, para. 127. 
 29 The applicant property owners&#8217;<b> </b>complaints of an ongoing interference with their right to respect for 
</p>
<p>their homes (article 8) also failed for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies as they had not been 
brought before the IPC (ibid., para. 133). 
</p>
<p> 30 Grand Chamber <i>Demopoulos and others v. Turkey</i> <i>Decision </i>(46113/92), 1 March 2010, para. 128. 
Following the <i>Demopoulos</i> decision, the Court declared several applications concerning alleged 
violations of property rights in northern Cyprus inadmissible for the non-exhaustion of domestic 
remedies, e.g. <i>Economides and others v. Turkey Decision </i>(68110/01),<i> Stylianou v. Turkey Decision 
</i>(33574/02)<i>, Eleftheriades and others v. Turkey Decision </i>(3882/02, 3883/02, 3887/02, 3884/02, 
3896/02)<i>.</i> 
</p>
<p> 31 In <i>Loizidou v. Turkey</i> (15318/89), the Court ruled that the applicant remained the legal owner of her 
property situated in the north, despite having lost control thereof due to lack of access. 
</p>
<p> 32 The case of <i>Demades v. Turkey</i> (16219/90) concerns the violation of the applicant&#8217;s right to the 
peaceful enjoyment of his property located in the northern part of Cyprus, insofar as he has been 
denied access to it, and control, use and enjoyment of it since 1974.  
</p>
<p> 33 The case<i> Xenides-Arestis v. Turkey</i> concerns the violation of the applicant&#8217;s right to respect for her 
home (situated in Famagusta) due to the denial since 1974 of access to her property situated in the 
northern part of Cyprus and consequent loss of control thereof.

<p>explanation as to the reasons why it should have at its disposal additional documents in 
order to be able to assess this issue36.  
</p>
<p>25. In the case of <i>Orams v. Apostolides37</i> the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in 
its final judgment of 19 January 201038 concurred with the ruling of the European Court of 
Justice in favour of Greek Cypriot Meletis Apostolides. The European Court of Justice on 
28 April 2009 concluded that the judgment of the District Court of Nicosia deciding a claim 
over property in the north is enforceable despite the fact that it concerns an area over which 
the Government does not exercise effective control39. In relation to the above case, the 
European Court of Human Rights on 10 June 2010 declared inadmissible the application in 
the case of <i>Orams v. Cyprus</i>40.  
</p>
<p>26. The situation in Varosha remains unchanged and the United Nations holds the 
Government of Turkey responsible for the status quo, states the latest Secretary-General&#8217;s 
report on the United Nations operation in Cyprus41. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>27. There were up to 201,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the area under the 
control of the Government of Cyprus in 2009, which made Cyprus the country with the 
highest proportion of IDPs as a percentage of its population (up to 22.3 per cent). Unlike 
children whose fathers have displaced person status, the children of women with this status 
are still not entitled to a refugee identity card. They are given a certificate by descent which 
does not enable them to access any benefits deriving from a refugee identity card, such as 
housing assistance42. In order to rectify the situation, the Parliament of the Republic of 
Cyprus in June 2010 passed amendments to the Registry Laws and to the Law Providing 
Housing Assistance to Displaced and other Persons. President Christofias found the 
amendments, due to their implications on the State budget, unconstitutional and referred 
them back to the Parliament. The decision now lies with the Supreme Court, which on 11 
October 2010 reserved its judgment as to the constitutionality of the amendments43. 
</p>
<p>28. In March 2010, the Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for the 
Protection of National Minorities of the Council of Europe (CoE AC) noted the new steps 
taken by the Government of Cyprus to create more favourable conditions for effective 
participation of the Turkish Cypriots living in the south in the social, economic and cultural

<p>claiming ownership of the land bought by the Orams in the north of Cyprus in 2002. The District 
Court ordered immediate demolition of the villa and other constructions which the Orams had erected 
on the land, for the land to be returned to Apostolides for his free possession and it also required the 
Orams to refrain form continuing the unlawful intervention on the land.

</p>
<p>article 6(1) (right to a fair trial) as being manifestly ill-founded. Regarding complaints under article

found out of time by the Court.

<p>life of Cypriot society44. The Committee also mentioned the efforts of the Government to 
promote dialogue and co-operation between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot 
community45. Nevertheless, the Committee noted, Turkish Cypriots are reportedly still at 
times facing hostile attitudes and difficulties, for instance in accessing social services and in 
education. The very limited use of Turkish, in spite of its status as an official language, 
complicates access to various public services for Turkish Cypriots, notwithstanding the 
measures taken by the authorities to provide information46.  
</p>
<p>29. The CoE AC recommended that the Government continue and strengthen its efforts 
to provide the necessary conditions for Turkish Cypriots to be able to exercise their rights 
effectively and have full and equal access to public services47. Special attention should be 
paid to the linguistic problems encountered by Turkish Cypriots in access to services and 
enjoyment of rights, as well as to the implementation of constitutional provisions on the use 
of official languages in Cyprus48.  
</p>
<p>30. The &#8220;direct trade regulation&#8221; 49  proposed by the European Commission is still 
pending adoption 50 . While the European Union (EU) aid programme for the Turkish 
Cypriot community, which seeks to encourage economic development in the northern part 
of the island, has continued, its implementation faces challenges, inter alia, in relation to 
cooperation between the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot communities51. 
</p>
<p>31. UNFICYP continued to assist Turkish Cypriots living in the south with access to 
welfare services, including basic services such as medical care, housing and education52. 
UNFICYP also continued to monitor the welfare of Turkish Cypriot prisoners and detainees 
in the south and Greek Cypriot prisoners in the north. No cases of discrimination were 
observed in the period from May to November 201053.

<p> 50 On 18 October 2010 the Legal Committee of the European Parliament shared the opinion of the 
Parliament&#8217;s legal service that EU trade with the northern part of Cyprus should be governed directly 
by the EU single market and customs union rules, and not by the EU&#8217;s rules for international trade. 
The proposed direct trade regulation would therefore need to be adopted by unanimity in the Council 
of Ministers and not under the ordinary legislative procedure and the qualified majority voting in the 
Council, which is used for international trade issues following the entry into force of the Lisbon 
treaty. The Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament still has to give its opinion on the 
Legal Committee&#8217;s decision. Source: &#8220;MEPs reject legal treatment of the northern part of Cyprus as a

<p><b> E. Right to life 
</b></p>
<p>32. On 27 January 2010, the Court delivered final judgements in two cases concerning 
unjustified killings by State agents in the context of the 1996 Greek-Cypriot demonstrations 
and the lack of an effective investigation into those killings (violation of article 2 of the 
ECHR) - <i>Andreou v. Turkey</i> and<i> Kallis and Androulla Panayi v. Turkey</i>54. Because of their 
similarities, both are being considered by the CoE CMD in the same group as the cases of 
<i>Solomou and others v. Turkey</i> (2008) and <i>Isaak v. Turkey</i> (2008). Regarding the latter, 
information is awaited on the regulatory framework governing the use of force and firearms 
by the police and on the measures taken to ensure that effective investigations are carried 
out into the killings of civilians in the northern part of Cyprus55. As regards the lack of 
effective investigation into killings, the Ministers&#8217; Deputies took note at their September 
2010 meeting that information is awaited as to whether investigations into the killings have 
been opened, and if so as to their results, as well as an action plan/action report in respect of 
all cases in the group56.  
</p>
<p>33. As regards the case of <i>Kakoulli v. Turkey</i> (2006)57, CoE CMD at its 1078th meeting 
recalled that the Cypriot authorities had indicated that it would be possible to carry out a 
further forensic examination of Mr. Kakoulli&#8217;s body. The Committee considered that the 
competent Turkish authorities should reassess the possibility of carrying out a new 
investigation into the death of Mr. Kakoulli and invited them to submit information in this 
respect58. On 26 March 2010 the Turkish authorities provided the desired information, 
which is being assessed by the CoE CMD. Regarding the excessive use of force and 
firearms, the Deputies noted that it had not been clear from the information provided that 
the regulatory framework governing the use of firearms by the security forces requires that 
the use of force must be &#8220;absolutely necessary&#8221; and invited the Turkish authorities to 
provide clarifications in this respect. Bilateral contacts are under way concerning the 
questions identified by the Committee59.  
</p>
<p>34. CoE CMD at its March 2010 meeting decided to close the examination of the <i>Adali 
v. Turkey</i> case (2005)60, after having satisfied itself that, within the time limit set, Turkey 
had paid the applicant the just satisfaction provided in the judgement61.

</p>
<p> 57 The <i>Kakoulli v. Turkey</i> case (38595/97) concerns the killing of the applicants&#8217; husband and father, in

and impartial investigation into this killing in violation of article 2 of the ECHR.

<p><b> F. Right to education 
</b></p>
<p>35. While there have been no new developments regarding the establishment of a 
Turkish-language primary school in Limassol, UNFICYP continued to work with the local 
authorities and community representatives in Limassol and Paphos to strengthen support 
mechanisms for vulnerable members of the Turkish Cypriot community in educational and 
social areas62.  
</p>
<p>36. UNFICYP continued to facilitate the delivery of textbooks and the appointment of 
teachers to the elementary and secondary Greek Cypriot schools in Rizokarpaso, on the 
Karpas peninsula in the northern part of the island63. As in previous years, the Turkish 
Cypriot authorities objected to the use of some (eight out of 281) Greek textbooks (on 
history, Cypriot literature, and religion) for the Karpas schools, claiming that they contain 
material offensive to Turkish Cypriots. They also continued to exercise the authority to 
approve and reject teachers appointed to the schools on the basis of political or other 
considerations64. 
</p>
<p>37. The textbooks in the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot community have 
traditionally portrayed history according to their own interpretations, official narratives and 
preconceptions65. The results of recent research confirmed significant influence of school 
books on the impressions regarding the other community in Cyprus. For the Turkish 
Cypriots, school books were the second and for the Greek Cypriot community the fourth 
most important source of information in formulating opinion on the other community66. 
While history books revised in the northern part of the island in 2004 included references to 
the shared past and experiences of both communities, they reverted to an ethnocentric 
approach following the 2009 elections67. The Republic of Cyprus&#8217; Ministry of Education 
and Culture has committed itself to revising the existing history textbooks within the next 
few years in the framework of an educational reform, which will affect all subjects68. 
</p>
<p>38. UNFICYP has suggested that both sides review their teaching materials with a view 
to promoting tolerance and understanding of all communities69. 
</p>
<p>39. The CoE AC welcomed special measures and programmes developed by the 
Government of Cyprus in the field of education to offer Turkish Cypriots living in the 
Republic of Cyprus easier access and provide classes in Turkish language and culture in the 
schools they attend70. Nevertheless, it noted with deep concern that, while specific steps

<p>have been taken to promote multicultural education, many teachers were reportedly proving 
unresponsive to this policy and hostile attitudes to Turkish Cypriots continued to be 
reported in schools in the south71. 
</p>
<p>40. Turkish Cypriot students still face a lack of access to EU exchange and educational 
programmes due to the non-recognition by the Republic of Cyprus of the universities in the 
northern part of the island. The European Commission is currently in contact with the 
authorities of the Republic of Cyprus regarding the possibility of offering Turkish Cypriots 
the option of studying at universities in the areas under the effective control of the 
Government of Cyprus in the academic year 2011/2012. This would happen within the 
framework of the scholarship scheme for the Turkish Cypriot community, which was set up 
by the Commission under the EU aid programme in order to compensate for the lack of 
mobility that would be offered by the Erasmus programme. The scheme allows Turkish 
Cypriot students and teachers to spend one year abroad at an EU university or higher 
education institution and the level of funding is far higher than that of Erasmus. In the 
academic year 2009/2010 scholarships were granted to 203 individuals and in the current 
academic year 102 students and teachers participate in the scheme72. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Freedom of religion and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>41. Access to sites and icons of religious and cultural significance continued to be 
facilitated by UNFICYP. From November 2009 to November 2010, the mission facilitated 
22 religious and commemorative events, of which 16 involved crossing the buffer zone to 
the northern part of the island, two involved crossing the buffer zone to the southern part 
and four were held in the buffer zone. A total of approximately 6,660 individuals 
participated in those events73.  
</p>
<p>42. For the first time since 1974, permission was granted for the Maronite community to 
conduct a religious service at the Ayia Marina Skyllouris church, despite its location inside 
a Turkish Forces military base. Encouraged by this positive development, UNFICYP 
received many more requests to facilitate religious observances and pilgrimages by Greek 
Cypriots in churches in the northern part of the island. Some of these were denied on 
various grounds, including the use of a church for other purposes such as a cultural centre 
or clinic, or its proximity to military bases; or for no specified reason74.  
</p>
<p>43. While generally enjoying freedom of worship, the Greek Cypriots living in the 
northern part of Cyprus must still inform/request permission from the authorities there to 
conduct religious services on specified days in some of the churches in their own villages 
and at the Apostolos Andreas monastery75. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>44. <b>While there have been some positive developments in the reporting period, such 
as the opening of a new crossing point and passing of legislative amendments aimed at 
ensuring equal treatment of children of displaced mothers, the division of the island of 
Cyprus continues to constitute an obstacle to the full enjoyment of human rights. It is
